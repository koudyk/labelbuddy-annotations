## View the data in this repo interactively
1) open our notebook by right-clicking on this Binder button and opening the link in a new tab -> [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neurodatascience/labelbuddy-annotations/HEAD?labpath=examples%2Fdash_data_viewer__for_binder_2.ipynb) 
   - The notebook will take a while to load because it needs to install the Python packages we need to run the interactive app (the installations are done on a virtual server, not your computer!)
2) When the notebook opens, click "run > run all cells" on the top toolbar
