    "This is a satellite project of the [NeuroBridge annotation project](https://github.com/NeuroBridge/Annotation-Project).\n",
    "The goal is to annotate the tasks used by task-based fMRI acquisitions described in the **NeuroBridge** papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documents were copied from [this directory](https://github.com/NeuroBridge/Annotation-Project/tree/main/Phase_1/INPUT_Papers_for_Annotation/All_Papers_For_Annotation_From_Phase_2) in the **NeuroBridge** repository, and converted from WebAnno3 format to [labelbuddy](https://jeromedockes.github.io/labelbuddy/labelbuddy/current/)'s format using [labelutils](https://github.com/jeromedockes/labelutils).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the documents for this project do not come from a [pubget](https://neuroquery.github.io/pubget/pubget.html) download, they have less metadata and a different formatting (no headings or paragraph breaks) than documents in other projects in this repository.\n",
    "Also, a **pubget** dataset is not available for download with `/scripts/download_datasets.py`.\n",
    "But keeping the same version of the documents makes it possible to combine the annotations created here with those of the larger **NeuroBridge** project, down to the character positions, which trumps the other details.\n",
