    "<mark class=\"annotated-text\">Recent studies have shown that FNC has dynamic properties ( ). With regard to rs-fMRI data, dynamic behavior of FNC can be captured, for example, by applying a sliding window approach ( ). In this approach, FNC is first estimated within smaller portions of the time course (tapered windows with a size of 30 TRs = 60s). Then, these windowed FNC matrices are used to identify recurring patterns of whole-brain connectivity via   k  -means clustering, yielding distinct ‘states’ (see   for further details). </mark>The optimal number of clusters can be estimated based on objective criteria like the elbow criterion that reflects the ratio of within- to between-cluster distances while testing for different numbers…\n",

To reduce the contamination of high-frequency noise in the time-resolved connectivity data, the MTD is averaged by calculating the mean value over a temporal window,   w  . Time-resolved functional connectivity was calculated between all 375 brain regions by using the MTD within a sliding temporal window of 15 time points (33 seconds at 2.2 s per window), which allowed for estimates of signals amplified at approximately 0.1 Hz. Individual functional connectivity matrices were then calculated within each temporal window, thus generating an unthresholded (i.e., signed and weighted) three-dimensional adjacency matrix (region × region × time) for each participant.</mark> The MTD for the pairwise interaction between region   i   and   j   is defined according to  : where   dt   is the first temporal derivative of the   i   or   j   time series at time   t  ,   σ   is …\n",
