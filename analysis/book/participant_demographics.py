# # Participant demographics

# We started annotating information about each study's participants: their number, sex, age, and possible diagnosis.
# More annotations are needed, but these annotations can already give an approximation of the number of participants in typical fMRI studies, and be used to validate systems that aim to extract that information automatically.
# You can read more about the participant annotations in the corresponding [project page](./projects/participant_demographics.md).

#
# The `labelrepo` package provides helpers to work with these annotations.
# Here we illustrate loading the annotations to make a couple of simple plots.
# The `get_participant_demographics` function returns a `pd.DataFrame` in which each row corresponds to a group of participants in a study, according to one annotator.
# The data used here is also available directly <a href="generated/participant_groups.csv">as a CSV file</a>.

# In this dataframe, each row contains the information collected by one annotator about a subgroup of participants in a study.
# You can read more about the nature of the annotations in the [project page](./projects/participant_demographics.md).
# The participants are divided into groups ("patients" or "healthy"), then each group is divided into an arbitrary number of *subgroups* (usually there is only one, but there can be several, eg "adolescents" and "adults" within the "healthy" group), and finally each subgroup is divided into "females" and "males".
# The summary dataframe provides information at the level of the subgroup: its name, the group it belongs to, the number of males and females in the subgroup.

# If several annotators have annotated a paper, the information each of them has annotated about each participant subgroup is stored in a separate row.
# We don't want to end up counting participant groups several times so here we simply keep the output of the first annotator for each study.

# The `labelrepo` package also provides a way to load information about documents, labels and annotations in the repository in general.
# Here we use it to read some complementary information about each paper.
# We also add the PMC url to turn scatter plot points into links later.
# Finally, we turn the publication year into a `datetime` to facilitate using it in plots.
