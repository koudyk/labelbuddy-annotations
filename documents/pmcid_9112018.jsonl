Our results show that PD patients exhibit a significantly decreased response in the basal ganglia (putamen and pallidum) and a trend toward decreased activity in the mirror system, particularly in the left parietal cortex (inferior parietal lobule and intraparietal sulcus). This reduced activation may be tied to a disruption of cognitive resonance mechanisms and may thus constitute the basis of impaired others\u2019 representations underlying action and emotion perception. We also found increased activation in the posterior cerebellum in PD, although only in a within-group analysis and not in comparison with healthy controls. This cerebellar activation may reflect compensatory mechanisms, an aspect that deserves further investigation. We discuss the clinical implications of our findings for the development of novel social skill training programs for PD patients. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is one of the most frequent neurodegenerative disorders (e.g.,  ). It is usually associated with manifest motor symptoms, such as tremor, bradykinesia and akinesia, but neurocognitive impairment and psychiatric disorders can also be observed (for recent reviews, see  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Within the neurocognitive sphere, PD can be characterized by disorders of social cognition (e.g.,  ,  ,  ). Social perception is one of the main social abilities affected in patients with PD ( ), particularly for what concerns action observation ( ), face perception ( ), and emotion recognition ( ). These social anomalies may lead to a wide range of negative outcomes, such as loneliness, stigma, and dehumanization, which might impair the patient\u2019s life more than other symptoms ( ). Despite this evidence, the neural substrates of social perception deficits in PD remain to be clarified ( ). \n\nPD is characterized by neurodegeneration of the basal ganglia, particularly the dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra ( ). Although social deficits in PD have been related to dopamine depletion in these nuclei ( ), particularly in the putamen ( ), alterations in the functioning of other brain regions may contribute to the impairment. Among these, the cerebellum \u2013 which is known to be involved in cognitive processing beyond motor control ( ,  ) - may play a critical role ( ). Indeed, abnormal cerebellum activity has been observed in PD patients during both cognitive (e.g.,  ,  ,  ) and social perception (e.g.,  ) tasks, as well as during rest conditions (e.g.,  ). Moreover, PD patients may show a hyper-metabolism in the cerebellum, possibly as a compensatory effort ( ): it is likely that the increased activity or connectivity in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop compensate the hypofunction in the striato-thalamo-cortical circuit to maintain function at a near normal level ( ,  ). Indeed, the results of several studies suggest that the cerebellar hyperactivation allows patients with PD to execute motor tasks at the same level as healthy controls (e.g.,  ). Moreover, machine-learning classification has shown that morphological alterations in the cerebellum are predictive of PD ( ). Importantly, however, the association between cerebellar activity and motor symptoms of PD is complex: in stark contrast to the compensatory mechanism hypothesis, changes in cerebellum activation have been associated with motor dysfunction of PD, such as resting tremor ( ), bradykinesia, and dyskinesias ( ). \n\nIn addition to the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, other regions seem to be associated with social perception alterations in PD.   reported that emotion recognition in PD patients was associated with decreased responses in mirror neuron areas such as the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and the supplementary motor cortex compared to healthy controls, possibly reflecting a disruption of neural resonance and thus be the basis of impaired emotion recognition in PD. In turn, other studies reported a somehow opposite pattern showing increased activation in somatosensory cortices (parietal lobe) during emotion recognition, this enhanced activation likely functioning as a compensatory mechanism for reduced striatal activation ( ). Furthermore, other studies reported a sub-cortical dysfunction during social perception processes in PD, particularly in the amygdala ( ). Neuroimaging results, however, have been overall inconsistent across studies ( ). \n\nMeta-analyses integrate experimental findings stemming from separate experiments into a unifying statistical model, thus highlighting the consistency of neural patterns shared by such experiments ( ). Although a recent   meta  -analysis by   addressed the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive and motor functions in PD, a neuroimaging   meta  -analysis for social processing in PD has not been carried out so far. Here, we implemented a coordinate-based   meta  -analysis on this topic, to clarify: (a) the neural bases of social perception processing in patients with PD and (b) the differences in social perception-related brain activation between patients with PD and healthy control (HC) participants. Specifically, we aimed to highlight the convergence across multiple experiments on social perception processes in patients with PD. Based on the literature, we expected to find in PD patients compared to healthy controls: a) a decreased activation in the frontal cortex and in the basal ganglia (see  ) and possibly b) evidence of increased activity in the cerebellum during processing of social information, which, as highlighted above, may be indicative of either beneficial compensatory mechanisms ( ), or motor dysfunction ( ). Regarding effects in the parietal cortex, we do not have specific hypotheses, considering that opposite results have been reported (see   for compensatory mechanisms, and   for defective mechanisms). \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Rationale of the   meta  -analytic approach \n  \nWe used a set of ALE   meta  -analyses to investigate the neural basis of impaired social perception in PD patients and their specificity with respect to healthy control individuals. Meta-analyses can overcome the limitations that individual neuroimaging experiments suffer from ( ). To carry out the   meta  -analysis for this study, we resorted to ALE, a statistical approach that capitalizes on Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates to integrate previously published experimental results ( ). Using ALE, we carried out two different analyses: one on PD patients\u2019 data, and one on HC participants\u2019 data. After that, we contrasted the respective   meta  -analyses between the two groups. Our goal was to identify the group-specific brain activations underlying social perception, irrespective of experimental materials (i.e., verbal or pictorial stimuli) and employed tasks (e.g., implicit or explicit; action observation or evaluation tasks; etc.). \n\nBy taking into account the variety of experimental procedures (i.e. materials and tasks) that have been used in studies on social perception, and by aggregating such variety   meta  -analytically, we can more confidently ensure the generalizability of our results beyond specific methodological choices ( ). The criteria for including studies in our   meta  -analysis were defined by M.A., and then verified by the other authors. This multiple verification by independent investigators can minimize the selection bias ( ). \n\n\n### Literature search and study selection \n  \nOur literature selection started by searching on Pubmed ( ) for the following keyword strings: \u201csocial cognition Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201csocial cognition Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201ctheory of mind Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201ctheory of mind Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cempathy Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cempathy Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cemotion Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cemotion Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cface Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cface Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cbody Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cbody Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201csocial perception Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201csocial perception Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cbiological motion Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cbiological motion Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cpoint light display Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cpoint light display Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201caction observation Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201caction observation Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cfacial Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d and \u201cfacial Parkinson PET\u201d. The preliminary pool of 870 retrieved studies, after duplicate removal, was evaluated based on title and abstract. The criteria for including studies in our   meta  -analysis were as follows: ( ):   \nPRISMA diagram depicting the selection process. \n  \n\n1 Reports written in English. \n\n2. Empirical studies using either functional magnetic resonance imaging (  f  MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET), excluding studies using other neuroimaging techniques (i.e., electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)) with different spatial and temporal resolution. \n\n3. Studies based on whole-brain images and analyses, thus excluding reports of neuroanatomically more restricted analyses produced by the application of regions of interest (ROIs) or small volume correction (SVC) ( ). \n\n4. Studies on individuals diagnosed with PD, in which the presence and the severity of the impairment was assessed by means of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) ( ). We decided to include this selection criteria as a check for the clinical evaluation of PD, given that UPDRS is the most well-established scale for assessing disability and impairment of PD ( ). Importantly, no studies were excluded for not fulfilling this criterion. \n\n5. Studies reporting the results of within-group comparisons, between-group comparisons, or both. More specifically, we selected coordinates from: (i) within-group simple effects, or/and (ii) between-group comparisons (i.e., PD vs. HC). We included the within-group data into the analyses to get a better overview on whether a specific brain area was more strongly associated with one group than the other, while still showing activation in both groups, or else whether the same brain area was exclusively activated in just one group (e.g.,  ). By including coordinates from different types of contrasts (i.e., both between and within), we tried to maximize the number of included papers with a specific focus on social perception in each group. \n\n6. Functional neuroimaging studies focused on social perception. More specifically, we ascertained to only include studies that reported statistical contrasts specifically targeting: \n\na) Human face and human action perception, involving the representation of other individuals. Therefore, we retained only tasks requiring participants to process stimuli eliciting a representation of others\u2019 actions and contrasting this with control conditions without human representation ( ), as well as tasks comparing the perception of faces versus non-meaningful mosaic-like colored patterns ( ). \n\nb) Direct comparisons between emotional stimuli and control stimuli (emotion\u00a0>\u00a0neutral in others;  ). We included paradigms in which participants attended to emotional stimuli (e.g., faces expressing positive and/or negative emotions) aimed to elicit emotional processing (either explicit or implicit), and contrasting this kind of emotional representation with control conditions in which there was no emotional characterization (e.g., neutral faces;  ). \n\nc) Positive correlations between brain activity and performance in social tasks (e.g., emotional facial recognition (EFR) task;  ) or in neuropsychological tests assessing aspects related to social deficits (e.g., depression;  ). \n\nWe excluded 760 irrelevant articles based on titles and abstracts. Closer full-text inspection of the remaining 110 articles according to the above selection criteria lead to the further exclusion of studies that did not employ   f  MRI or PET techniques (8 studies); review articles (4 studies); studies adopting either ROIs or SVC for statistical analyses (13 studies); studies not focusing on either PD patients (6 studies) or social perception (57 studies); studies not reporting essential information, such as x/y/z coordinates (8 studies). Fourteen studies in total fulfilled the above specified criteria. \n\nWe sought to increment the number of compatible studies by closely inspecting studies that did not enter our first-pass literature search but either quoted, or were quoted by, the 14 selected studies. We also closely inspected recent review articles and   meta  -analyses focused on cognitive processes in PD patients ( ,  ). This second-pass search yielded 13 additional studies matching our inclusion criteria, thus increasing the total number of selected studies to 27 ( ). Of these 27 previously published studies, 25 studies reported activation foci for PD patients and could thus be included in the within-group ALE   meta  -analysis on PD patients ( ). These 25 studies provided 25 independent experiments (i.e. individual comparisons reported) with overall 455 PD subjects and 204 foci. In turn, 18 studies reported activation foci for healthy control individuals, and could enter the within-group ALE   meta  -analysis on healthy controls. These 18 studies provided 18 independent experiments, with overall 317 HC subjects and 196 foci ( ). The number of studies entering the two   meta  -analyses satisfied methodological recommendations on the ALE method ( ,  ), particularly ensuring that results would not disproportionally represent just a few experiments (see also  ).   \nOverview of the 27 studies included in the   meta  -analysis on the neural bases of social perception in both patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and healthy control subjects (HC). \n    \n\nAnother important methodological caveat is that the presence of more than one experiment including the same participants can undermine the validity of the   meta  -analytic results. To cope with this problem, we pooled the coordinates from all the relevant contrasts of a study as if they derived from just one experiment, thus effectively adjusting for within-group effects ( ). This issue concerned 14 out of 27 studies. \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nWe used the GingerALE software 3.0.2 ( ) to conduct a set of ALE analyses aiming at the identification of the brain areas associated with social perception in either PD patients, HC, or both groups. We followed the method described by  , resulting in the same procedure reported in  . In a first step, each of the activation coordinates derived from the selected studies, keeping separate those related to PD patients from the HC ones, was taken as the centre of a three-dimensional Gaussian probability distribution capturing the spatial uncertainty intrinsically associated with the coordinate data. All coordinates gathered from the selected studies that were not already in the MNI space were manually converted from the Tailairach to the MNI space by using the transformation tool supplied with GingerALE ( ). The set of activation coordinates of each experiment was used to calculate probability distributions in the image space, which was then fitted in every voxel to yield a modeled activation (MA) map. The combination of the MA maps produced the ALE scores representing the convergence across experiments of activation in each brain voxel ( ). In order to provide reliable statistical estimates (i.e. \u201ctrue\u201d convergence as opposed to random convergence), the ALE scores were contrasted against an empirically defined null distribution ( ). The null distribution is generated by random spatial association between experiments, with the distribution of foci within any given experiment maintained fixed. To this aim, a voxel was sampled at random from each MA map, and the union of the obtained values was calculated. This permutation was iterated 1,000 times and at each iteration the obtained ALE score was retained, yielding a densely sampled ALE null distribution. The comparison between the \u201ctrue\u201d and the null distribution effectively instantiates random-effects statistics, which represent the above-chance convergence across experiments, mitigating the possible preponderance of coordinate clustering in just one or in a small subset of experiments. To correct for multiple comparisons across voxels and protect against false positive errors, we adopted a p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 cluster-level threshold with family wise error type correction, with an uncorrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 cluster-forming threshold and 1,000 permutations ( ). \n\nIn a second analytical step, the significance maps that were separately obtained from, respectively, the PD and HC studies, were used to calculate direct comparisons between PD patients and HC, and the conjunction analyses across the two groups, to unveil, respectively, specific and common   meta  -analytic activation effects. This is accomplished by first generating a conjunction image, namely the voxel-wise minimum value across the ALE images for PD and HC, representing common brain activations in the two groups ( ). Subsequently, two ALE contrasts images were generated by directly subtracting one ALE image from the other. To correct for study size, GingerALE implements a random permutation of coordinates in two groups of the same size as the original datasets. A null distribution was generated by iterating a random permutation 1,000 times, each time subtracting the ALE images of the two simulated groups. The \u201ctrue data\u201d were then compared to the null distribution at every voxel. The ALE subtraction scores were converted to Z scores. For the between-group comparisons, given the unavailability of family wise error type corrected cluster-level inference in the GingerALE software ( ), we adopted a conventional uncorrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 threshold (as in previous publications, see for example,  ,  ,  ,  ) and a minimum cluster volume size of 100\u00a0mm  with 1,000 permutations. For exploratory purposes, in order to also reveal possible increased or decreased   meta  -analytic activation effects showing a trend towards statistical significance, we also run the within-group analyses adopting a slightly less conservative statistical threshold of\u00a0<\u00a00.1 cluster-level threshold with family wise error type correction, with an uncorrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 cluster-forming threshold and 1,000 permutations. This less conservative threshold then also constituted the input for the between-group comparisons for which, as previously noted, family wise error type correction is unavailable in GingerALE, and where we therefore again used a conventional uncorrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 threshold and a minimum cluster volume size of 100\u00a0mm  with 1,000 permutations. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Social perception in patients with Parkinson disease \n  \nSocial perception processes in PD patients recruited consistent activation in the right middle temporal gyrus and in the fusiform gyrus bilaterally, alongside the right posterior cerebellum (lobule VI) (  a;  ).

In turn, only a few studies have focused on the neural correlates of social perception deficits in PD patients, with rather inconsistent results. Here, we used a coordinate-based neuroimaging   meta  -analysis procedure to highlight the consistency in the available findings. This is the first neuroimaging   meta  -analysis that aimed to clarify the neural bases of social perception impairments in PD patients. We expected to find a decreased activation in the frontal cortex and in the basal ganglia and possibly an increased activity in the cerebellum in PD patients, compared to HC participants. \n\n### Social perception in PD patients \n  \nOur results show that during social perception tasks PD patients reveal consistent activations in a bilateral network involving the middle and inferior occipital gyri and the fusiform gyrus, as well as the right middle temporal gyrus and the right posterior cerebellum (lobule VI). \n\nBrain responses elicited by social perception tasks have been previously found in the temporal and fusiform cortex of PD patients (e.g.,  ,  ), in agreement with our results. It is well known that the fusiform gyrus plays a fundamental role in face processing ( ,  ,  ). Other regions in the middle and superior temporal sulcus are crucially involved in social perception, and particularly in the perception of biological motion involving body parts such as faces, hands, and postures of conspecifics ( ,  ,  ). \n\nOur data are also consistent with increasing evidence showing the involvement of the posterior (lateral) cerebellum in social perception tasks ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ), as suggested also by connectivity studies showing bidirectional closed loops between the posterior cerebellar lobe and the mentalizing network ( ). In particular, we found a specific activation in the lobule VI. Lobule VI to Lobule IX represent the posterior cerebellar lobe, which is separated by the primary fissure from the anterior lobe (lobules I-V) and by the posterolateral fissure from the flocculonodular lobe (lobule X). The posterior lobe (particularly lobules VI and VII) has been associated with language, spatial, executive, working memory, and social-affective tasks ( ), rather than motor tasks ( ). The role of the cerebellum in social prediction and social perception in healthy participants has been recently supported by noninvasive brain stimulation (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and neuroimaging data (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nA general role of the posterior cerebellum in social cognition has been assumed in relation to supporting optimal predictions about social interactions ( ). In the motor domain, motor sequence predictions are created by the cerebellum and are then compared with feedback signals from external inputs. In this way, online adjusting of motor action execution becomes possible ( ). It is nowadays acknowledged that the cerebellum constructs internal models also for purely mental states, without movements or somatosensory feedback ( ,  ,  ). In this view, the posterior cerebellum may be involved in the processing of social stimuli by providing internal models of social interactions, thus allowing predicting/anticipating others\u2019 behaviors in the social environment ( ,  ,  ). Recently, also data from neuropsychological studies in children with congenital ( ) and acquired ( ) cerebellar damage supported the role of the cerebellum in social prediction. Nevertheless, as discussed in the Introduction, the exact nature of increased cerebellar activation in PD remains elusive, with contrasting interpretations favoring either beneficial compensatory mechanisms ( ) or motor dysfunction ( ). \n\n\n### Social perception in healthy controls \n  \nDuring social perception tasks, HC subjects displayed consistent activation in left basal ganglia. \n\nIn addition to their motor function, the basal ganglia also subserve cognitive functions ( ,  ,  ). Previous studies have pointed to a critical role of basal ganglia in social cognition processes such as emotion regulation and recognition as well as reward processing ( ,  ; for review see  ,  ). The basal ganglia, through the selection of relevant and the filtering of irrelevant emotional stimuli ( ), promote quick and appropriate behavioral responses ( ). The continuous repetition of these selection process (relevant vs. irrelevant stimuli) leads to a reinforcement of neural emotional responses, which may become largely automatic ( ). \n\n\n### Commonalities and differences between PD patients and HC during social perception tasks \n  \nWe found greater activation in healthy subjects compared to PD patients in the left basal ganglia. In turn, patients with PD had no greater activation than controls. Also, we did not find any common significant activation between patients with PD and healthy control individuals during social processing in brain areas related to recognition of social signals. However, this latter finding likely depends on the limited number of available studies reducing statistical power (for similar results, see  ,  ). \n\nSocial impairments are frequent in several basal ganglia disorders (e.g. in Huntington\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Tourette\u2019s syndrome) and have been associated with fronto-striatal dysfunctions ( ,  ). Different studies showed that the beta rhythms in basal ganglia during action perception are partially overlapping with the changes reported during action execution ( ,  ,  ), supporting the idea that basal ganglia may support mirror network patterns of activation ( ,  ). Both neuroimaging findings ( ,  ) and neuropsychological studies ( ) support the idea that socio-emotional symptoms in PD are explained by a mirror network alteration, involving also the basal ganglia ( ). \n\nThere is converging evidence that the posterior cerebellum may provide compensatory support to the dysfunctional basal ganglia in PD patients ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Accordingly to our result, several studies included in our   meta  -analysis showed posterior cerebellum activations in PD patients (e.g.,  ,  ,  ). Although the direct comparison targeting stronger   meta  -analytic activations in PD than in HC did not yield any significant effects in the posterior cerebellum (possibly due to the limited sample size, see  ,  ,  ), at a qualitative level, we found an activation of the right posterior cerebellum when PD patients were analyzed alone, whereas no comparable activation was found in HC subjects. Based on these qualitative differences alone, and due to the lack of a significant   meta  -analytic effect in the direct comparison, a strong claim for compensatory cerebellar activation in PD patients is not supported. Further evidence in larger study and   meta  -analytic samples is required to better elucidate this issue. \n\n\n### Exploratory analyses \n  \nUsing a less conservative threshold, we found that, during social tasks, healthy control subjects displayed a trend towards significant activation in the left IPL, alongside the left IPS and the left postcentral gyrus. A trend towards a statistically significant activation increase for HC compared to patients with PD in the left IPL and IPS also emerged in the between-group analysis. \n\nPrevious neuroimaging experiments suggested that the parietal cortex is involved in the processing of social and emotional information in HC ( ). A causal role for the parietal cortex in social perception was also supported by the results of a   meta  -analysis on brain lesion studies ( ). \n\nIt has been shown that visual processing of facial emotional expressions leads to activations in the IPL ( ,  ). The IPS seems to support the adaptive online control of actions ( ,  ) and is involved in action goal coding ( ). Both action perception and action execution are represented in the IPS ( ). Moreover, the IPS is also involved in face processing ( ) and emotion differentiation ( ). All these socio-emotional processes are supported by the basic mirror neuron mechanisms, which allow to respond to social stimuli of conspecifics with an internal brain representation of their movements and actions ( ). \n\nOur results, although only trendwise, thus confirm the hypothesis of an impairment of the mirror neuron resonance system in patients with PD. Lesions of IPL/IPS extending to the somatosensory areas and supramarginal gyrus can lead to social perception deficits ( ). Furthermore, decreased activation and connectivity patterns between the IPL, primary motor cortex, and supplementary motor area (SMA) in patients with PD were shown during both resting state conditions ( ) and motor tasks ( ), probably reflecting an impairment in the neural systems supporting motor preparation and initiation ( ). The posterior part of the superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) represents the visual input of the human mirror neuron system, from pSTS the information is forwarded to the parietal cortex ( ). Finally, information is forwarded to the inferior frontal gyrus and the ventral premotor cortex, where action goals are coded ( ). Thus, deactivation of mirror neuron areas in the parietal cortex may be one reason for a deficit in the neural mechanism for social resonance, and may consequently be a putative basis for impaired social perception in PD ( ; see also  ). However, considering that our results only represent a statistical trend, more solid evidence is required to support this interpretation. \n\n\n### Possible confounding variables \n  \nConsidering variability of both clinical conditions and clinical treatment (e.g., levodopa equivalent daily dose) between different patients with PD, it would be important to consider these aspects when investigating the neural outcomes of PD. Particularly, the type of dopaminergic treatment, the use of deep brain stimulation, and a predominant left side motor symptom onset seem to have a noticeable effect on social processing in PD (e.g.,  ). Unfortunately, considering the low number of studies focused on social perception on PD, we were not able to contrast studies with different medication conditions, nor to select only studies using a specific medication condition. Moreover, even within an individual study there can be heterogeneity in the medication status of PD patients (e.g.,  ). Most of the studies included in our   meta  -analysis did not report the side of motor symptom onset, nor information regarding treatment with deep brain stimulation. This is probably why also in other   meta  -analyses on PD these aspects were not considered (e.g.,  ). The lack of control for these clinical variables, however, represents a limitation of our results. For clarity, we provide a table in the   with information pertaining to these clinical aspects for each study (  Table S1  ). \n\n\n### Conclusion and future directions \n  \nIn conclusion, our results suggest that social perception deficits in PD patients involve the left basal ganglia, and we also found a trend toward a decreased activity in the mirror system areas. An important question for future research regards the putative compensatory role of the posterior cerebellum in PD. \n\nAt a practical level, our results can guide the design and the implementation of neuro-psychological training programs for PD patients, supporting the crosstalk between basic scientists and clinical researchers ( ). Action observation training (AOT) in PD patients enhanced the execution of spontaneous movements ( ,  ), and observing and performing a target movement simultaneously aids patient performance ( ). This could happen since these trainings lead to a stronger activation of the brain network that subtends motor control ( ), which is minimally damaged in the first stages of PD (e.g.,  ). This stronger activation may cause a brain system reinforcement, compensating the alterations in motor execution areas. Based on our results, it might be useful to add social stimuli to this training (e.g., images or video clips depicting emotional faces, interacting people, social gestures), promoting the observation and imitation of social behavior, so that PD patients could counteract the deterioration of simulation systems underlying social perception. Critically, the effects of this type of social training may be further enhanced by combining the behavioral approach with posterior cerebellar non-invasive stimulation to boost the compensatory effect of cerebellum activity (e.g.,  ,  ; see also   for a review on the possible benefit in using non-invasive brain stimulation in PD). \n\n\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest \n  \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9112018, "text_md5": "9bddd5eb3809ab85493c95067f8d1519", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 100], "journal": [101, 116], "publication_year": [118, 122], "title": [133, 215], "keywords": [229, 336], "abstract": [349, 2030], "body": [2039, 37734]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 35569229, "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2022.103031", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9112018", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9112018"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9112018\">9112018</a>", "list_title": "PMC9112018  Action and emotion perception in Parkinson\u2019s disease: A neuroimaging meta-analysis"}
