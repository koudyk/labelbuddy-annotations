The aim of this systematic review was to summarize and value the evidence on MRI markers of memory, attention, and executive functioning after acute onset brain injury. We included ninety-eight studies, on six classes of MRI factors (location and severity of damage (n\u00a0=\u00a015), volume/atrophy (n\u00a0=\u00a036), signs of small vessel disease (n\u00a0=\u00a015), diffusion-weighted imaging measures (n\u00a0=\u00a036), resting-state functional MRI measures (n\u00a0=\u00a013), and arterial spin labeling measures (n\u00a0=\u00a01)). Three measures showed consistent results regarding their association with cognition. Smaller hippocampal volume was associated with worse memory in fourteen studies (pooled correlation 0.58 [95% CI: 0.46\u20130.68] for whole, 0.11 [95% CI: 0.04\u20130.19] for left, and 0.34 [95% CI: 0.17\u20130.49] for right hippocampus). Lower fractional anisotropy in cingulum and fornix was associated with worse memory in six and five studies (pooled correlation 0.20 [95% CI: 0.08\u20130.32] and 0.29 [95% CI: 0.20\u20130.37], respectively). Lower functional connectivity within the default-mode network was associated with worse cognition in four studies. In conclusion, hippocampal volume, fractional anisotropy in cingulum and fornix, and functional connectivity within the default-mode network showed consistent associations with cognitive performance in all types of acute onset brain injury. External validation and cut off values for predicting cognitive impairments are needed for clinical implementation. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAcute onset brain injury resulting from postanoxic encephalopathy (PAE), traumatic brain injury (TBI), or stroke is a common cause of death or disability, with an incidence of 50\u20131,507 per 100,000 people a year, worldwide ( ,  ,  ). Over the past years, survival rates have increased ( ,  ,  ), leading to more people living with the consequences of acute onset brain injury. \n\nImpairments of memory, attention, and executive functioning are frequently reported in patients after acute onset brain injury ( ,  ,  ) and strongly related to reduced quality of life ( ,  ,  ). International experts recommend screening to identify patients at risk for enduring cognitive impairments ( ,  ,  ). Subsequently, those at risk could be provided with cognitive rehabilitation therapy. \n\nMRI markers may contribute to identification of patients at risk for cognitive impairments and clarify underlying mechanisms. The majority of research on this topic has been performed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases or dementia. Some main findings are that lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in multiple brain regions ( ), lower functional connectivity (FC) within the default-mode network (DMN) ( ), and lower hippocampal and cortical volumes ( ) were associated with poorer cognitive performance. \n\nIn patients with acute onset brain injury similar MRI markers have been associated with cognitive performance. In ischemic stroke and TBI patients, lower hippocampal volume ( ), lower FA in the cingulum ( ), and lower FC in resting-state networks ( ) were associated with poorer cognitive functioning. However, lack of uniformity of the evidence, resulting from a large variability of study designs and reported effect sizes, hampers valuing and comparing the various reported MRI markers of cognitive function after acute onset brain injury. Since patients with PAE, TBI, or stroke may face similar cognitive impairments, it is interesting to group these patients to find MRI markers associated with these impairments after acute onset brain injury. Systematic reviews, but more importantly meta-analyses summarizing and interpreting these results in the complete acute onset brain injury population are lacking. Therefore, the possible value of MRI for predicting cognitive impairments after acute onset brain injury is still unsure. \n\nHere, we provide a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of MRI factors associated with (impairments of) memory, attention, or executive functioning after acute onset brain injury. Furthermore, we present which early MRI factors have been reported to predict long term (impairments of) memory, attention, or executive functioning after acute onset brain injury. These cognitive domains are among the most affected after stroke, TBI and PAE. With this review we aim to value and rank the evidence and provide a starting point for studies on mechanisms and predictive values of MRI factors of cognitive impairments after acute onset brain injury. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nThe protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO:CRD42021229488) and reported here along PRISMA guidelines. \n\n### Search strategy \n  \nA systematic literature search was performed on January 8th 2021 using Scopus and PubMed. Search strategies are displayed in Online Resource Tables S1 and S2. \n\n\n### Selection of articles \n  \nTwo reviewers (MV,AG) independently screened titles and abstracts, followed by full texts, using Rayyan QCRI. Disagreements were discussed to reach consensus. \n\nInclusion criteria were:   \nObservational cohort studies (cross-sectional and longitudinal). \n  \nAdult (\u226518\u00a0years) acute onset brain injury population (or mixed sample with separate analysis of acute brain injury population). This included patients with TBI, stroke, and PAE. Populations with repetitive injury (sports players, soldiers or veterans, and patients with small vessel disease without acute onset injury) were excluded. \n  \nResting-state cerebral MRI performed (or mixed sample with separate analysis of MRI data). \n  \nMemory, attention and/or executive functioning evaluated using neuropsychological tests with known psychometric quality and validity in the acute onset brain injury population. We only included tests with diagnostic values for distinguishing impairments from normal functioning (z-scores, norm scores, thresholds), validated in the acute onset brain injury population, and used by more than one research group. Tests primarily used and intended for research setting were not included. Cognitive impairments mostly caused by focal brain lesions, like aphasia or neglect, were not regarded. \n  \nPublished between 2000 and January 2021. \n  \nWritten in English. \n  \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nThe first reviewer (MV) extracted the following data from the articles: study design, inclusion & exclusion criteria, demographics (number of patients, age, sex, education), MRI (timing, sequence parameters, analysis, predictors), cognition (timing, domain, test(s), analysis, scoring method), correlation coefficients, odds ratios, group differences, or regression parameters. We assumed that MRI and cognitive testing were performed on approximately the same day in case of a cross-sectional study design. \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nThe first reviewer (MV) performed quality assessment based on the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool ( ). Six bias domains were rated as having high, moderate or low risk of bias. \n\nWe used the four most important domains for our review (prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, study confounding, and statistical analysis and reporting) to evaluate overall risk of bias, since these domains significantly influence associations between the MRI markers and cognitive outcome measures, both in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Overall risk was defined as low (at least three low risk domains, no high risk domains), moderate (at least two low risk domains, at most one high risk domain), or high. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nData are presented in a descriptive way in tables and figures. The first reviewer (MV) performed meta-analyses in R (v4.0.0, R Foundation) for associations described in five or more articles ( ). Only correlation coefficients based on predefined ROIs were taken into account to prevent inclusion of impossibly high correlations caused by circularity errors ( ,  ,  ). Pooled correlation coefficients were calculated with a random effects model. Missing data were requested from the corresponding authors by e-mail with a reminder after one week. In case of no or negative response, missing results were not included in meta-analyses. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nLiterature search resulted in 1,856 unique titles. Based on screening of title and abstract (n\u00a0=\u00a01,856) and full texts (n\u00a0=\u00a0405), we included 98 articles ( ).   \nOverview of the article selection process. \n  \n\n### Characteristics of the included studies \n  \nThe majority of studies were cross-sectional (n\u00a0=\u00a069, 70\u00a0%). The remaining 29 (30\u00a0%) were longitudinal. \n\nAll three patient populations were studied: PAE (n\u00a0=\u00a05), TBI (n\u00a0=\u00a059), and stroke (n\u00a0=\u00a034). The numbers of participants per study ranged from 5 to 395 (6,279 in total). The range of mean ages in studies on PAE was 43\u201364, on TBI 22\u201349, and on stroke 40\u201377\u00a0years. \n\nMemory was tested most frequently (n\u00a0=\u00a088), followed by executive functioning (n\u00a0=\u00a059), and attention (n\u00a0=\u00a035). Used neuropsychological tests and timing of testing varied greatly. Information on used neuropsychological tests and timing is presented in Online Resource Tables S3 \u2013 S8. Six classes of MRI measures were studied: location and severity of damage (n\u00a0=\u00a015), volume/atrophy (n\u00a0=\u00a036), signs of small vessel disease (n\u00a0=\u00a015), diffusion-weighted imaging measures (n\u00a0=\u00a036), resting-state functional MRI measures (n\u00a0=\u00a013), and arterial spin labeling measures (n\u00a0=\u00a01). Time between injury and cognitive testing or MRI ranged from a few days to 49\u00a0years and time from MRI to cognitive testing from a few hours to three years. \n\nThe overall risk of bias was low in 48 studies (49\u00a0%), moderate in 39 studies (40\u00a0%), and high in eleven studies (11\u00a0%). Risk of bias was highest in study confounding and statistical analysis and reporting domains.   shows study characteristics including risk of bias.   \nCharacteristics of included studies. \n    \n\n\n### Results of the included studies \n  \n#### Location and extent of damage \n  \nCharacteristics and results of studies on location and extent of damage are summarized in Online Resource Table S3. This class was only investigated after TBI or stroke. \n\n##### Associations \n  \nLarger lesion volume ( ,  ,  ), damage to the mammillothalamic tract ( ), lower grey matter density ( ), and lower grey matter/white matter contrast ( ) were associated with worse memory performance. Six studies reported absence of an association between damage and memory ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nLeft-sided lesions were associated with worse attention performance than right-sided lesions ( ). Three studies reported absence of an association between damage and attention ( ,  ,  ). \n\nDamage to the lateral cholinergic projections ( ) was associated with worse executive functioning. Four studies reported absence of an association between damage and executive functioning ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\n\n##### Prediction \n  \nLarger lesion volume was predictive for worse memory performance at one\u00a0year, while right sided lesions and cortical lesions were predictive for better memory performance ( ). \n\nBilateral lesions were predictive for worse executive functioning ( ). Presence of DWI lesions was predictive for more decline in executive functioning in the first six\u00a0months ( ). \n\n\n\n#### Volume/atrophy \n  \nCharacteristics and results of studies on cerebral volume/atrophy are summarized in Online Resource Table S4. \n\n##### Associations \n  \nStudies in all three populations showed significant associations between volumes of hippocampus or amygdala and memory performance, wherein poorer memory performance was associated with lower volumes ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Only one study showed absence of a significant correlation ( ). Pooled correlation coefficients for whole, left and right hippocampus with memory performance were 0.58 [95% CI: 0.46\u20130.68], 0.11 [95% CI: 0.04\u20130.19], and 0.34 [95% CI: 0.17\u20130.49], respectively ( a, Table S1). Demographic data and study design of the studies included in meta-analyses are shown in  . Furthermore, smaller volumes of grey matter ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), white matter ( ,  ,  ), multiple brain lobes ( ,  ), cingulate gyrus ( ), and mammillothalamic tract ( ) were correlated with worse memory performance. On the other hand, larger volumes of CSF ( ,  ,  ) and higher atrophy rates of cortex ( ), left thalamus ( ), and medial temporal lobe ( ) were associated with worse performance. Five studies reported absence of an association between brain volume and memory ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ).  a shows an overview of the number of studies that described a positive correlation between brain volumes and memory performance.   \nForest plots for the correlations between MRI markers and memory functioning. a.

Positive correlation between brain volume and memory performance. Highlighted structures include (dark to light) hippocampus, cortex, amygdala, and temporal lobe. b. Positive correlation between fractional anisotropy and memory performance. Highlighted regions include (dark to light) cingulum, fornix, corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus. \n  \n\nSmaller volumes of grey matter ( ) and cingulate gyrus ( ), and higher atrophy rates of cortex ( ,  ), white matter ( ), multiple gyri ( ), and temporal lobe ( ) were associated with worse attention performance. Five studies reported absence of an association between brain volume and attention ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nOne study showed a significant association between lower hippocampal volume and worse executive functioning ( ), while three other studies showed no association ( ,  ,  ). Additionally, smaller cortical volumes ( ,  ,  ), larger ventricle volumes ( ,  ), and higher atrophy rates of whole brain ( ), temporal and frontal lobes ( ,  ), and cortex ( ) were associated with worse performance. Eight studies reported absence of an association between brain volume and executive functioning ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\n\n##### Prediction \n  \nLower hippocampal volume at three to six months was predictive for memory decline between three to six months and three years ( ). Furthermore, higher atrophy rates of total brain, right and left temporal lobe, and frontal lobe were predictive for attention and executive functioning, but not memory performance, at twelve months ( ). \n\n\n\n#### Signs of small vessel disease \n  \nCharacteristics and results of studies on small vessel disease measures are summarized in Online Resource Table S5. This class was only investigated after stroke. \n\n##### Associations \n  \nMore severe white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) ( ) and presence of WMHs in target regions ( ), were associated with worse memory performance. Four studies reported absence of an association between WMHs or cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and memory ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nWMHs in target regions were associated with worse attention performance ( ). Three studies reported absence of an association between WMHs or CMBs and attention ( ,  ,  ). \n\nMore severe WMHs ( ,  ,  ,  ), WMHs in target regions ( ,  ), and number and location of CMBs ( ) were associated with worse executive functioning. Four studies reported absence of an association between WMHs or CMBs and executive functioning ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\n\n##### Prediction \n  \nWMH volume was predictive for larger memory decline in the first three years after the event ( ). Furthermore, presence of CMBs, multilocular CMBs, more WMHs, and more deep WMHs were predictive for worse memory performance at three to six months ( ,  ). One study showed no prediction of reverting from memory impairments to normal memory functioning based on CMBs ( ). \n\nPresence of CMBs and multilocular CMBs were also predictive for worse executive functioning at six months, but not for attention performance ( ). \n\n\n\n#### Diffusion-weighted imaging \n  \nCharacteristics and results of studies on diffusion-weighted imaging measures are summarized in Online Resource Table S6. This class was only investigated after TBI or stroke. \n\n##### Associations \n  \nLower FA in corpus callosum ( ,  ,  ), cingulum ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ), fornix ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ), uncinate fasciculus ( ), and superior longitudinal fasciculus ( ,  ) were associated with worse memory performance. A larger number of brain regions with reduced FA correlated with worse functioning ( ). Pooled correlation coefficients for FA in cingulum and fornix with memory performance were 0.20 [95% CI: 0.08\u20130.32] and 0.29 [95% CI: 0.20\u20130.37], respectively ( b and c). Demographic data and study design of the studies included in meta-analyses are shown in  .  b shows an overview of the number of studies that described a positive correlation between FA of specific brain regions and memory performance. \n\nResults for diffusivity measures were not as straightforward. Worse memory performance was associated with lower diffusivity in thalamus ( ,  ), external capsule ( ), corpus callosum ( ), and total white matter ( ), and higher diffusivity in splenium ( ) and temporal lobe ( ). Higher kurtosis in cingulum, centrum semiovale, and total white matter was associated with worse performance ( ), while lower kurtosis in superior longitudinal fasciculus was associated with worse memory ( ). \n\nIn structural connectivity analyses, disruptions of the cingulum ( ), fornix ( ), connection between cingulum and brainstem ( ), or structural connectome ( ) were found in patients with worse memory performance. Higher betweenness centrality in multiple gyri was associated with better memory functioning ( ). Seven studies reported absence of an association between anisotropy or diffusivity and memory ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nLower FA in corpus callosum ( ), cingulum ( ), and superior longitudinal fasciculus ( ) was associated with worse attention functioning. Higher diffusivity in the thalamus was associated with worse attention functioning ( ,  ). Lower kurtosis was associated with worse attention performance ( ). Four studies reported absence of an association between anisotropy or diffusivity and attention ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nLower FA in corpus callosum ( ), cingulum ( ), uncinate fasciculus ( ), and superior longitudinal fasciculus ( ,  ) was also associated with worse executive functioning. A higher number of brain regions with reduced FA was associated with worse performance ( ). Higher diffusivity in corpus callosum ( ,  ), cingulum ( ), and frontal white matter ( ,  ) was associated with worse executive functioning, as well. In structural connectivity analysis, disruption of structural connectome was associated with worse executive functioning ( ). Lower eigenvector centrality in left peri-callosal region, right superior frontal gyrus, left thalamus, left caudate, left insula, and right cingulate cortex was associated with worse executive functioning ( ). Four studies reported absence of an association between anisotropy or diffusivity and executive functioning ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\n\n##### Prediction \n  \nLower FA and higher diffusivity in cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and interior longitudinal fasciculus was predictive for worse memory performance at least one year later ( ). However, in the uncinate fasciculus, both lower FA and lower AD were predictive for worse memory performance ( ). Furthermore, higher betweenness centrality in the left inferior frontal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus was predictive for worse memory performance after three months ( ). \n\nIn contrast, higher FA and lower diffusivity in anterior corona radiate, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus were predictive for worse attention performance at least one year later ( ). \n\n\n\n#### Resting-state functional MRI \n  \nCharacteristics and results of studies on resting-state functional MRI markers are summarized in Online Resource Table S7. This class was only investigated after TBI or stroke. \n\n##### Associations \n  \nLower FC between nodes within the DMN ( ,  ,  ) and between the DMN and right middle frontal gyrus ( ) was associated with worse memory performance. In contrast, higher FC between DMN and right cingulate gyrus, left claustrum, and left inferior frontal gyrus was associated with worse performance ( ). Additionally, multiple functional connections were associated with memory functioning: FC within right anterior caudate ( ), FC between left thalamus and left middle frontal gyrus ( ), FC between dorsal attention network and right precentral gyrus ( ), and FC between bilateral temporal gyri ( ). Decreased spontaneous neural activity and decreased regional homogeneity in the cingulate gyrus ( ,  ) were associated with worse memory functioning. Four studies reported absence of an association between FC and memory ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nLower FC within the DMN ( ,  ,  ) and sensorimotor network ( ) was associated with worse attention functioning. Furthermore, decreased regional homogeneity within the cingulate cortex was associated with worse attention ( ). \n\nLower FC in caudate ( ) was associated with worse executive functioning. Three studies reported absence of an association between FC and executive functioning ( ,  ,  ). \n\n\n##### Prediction \n  \nLower FC in the occipital cerebellar network was predictive for worse memory performance six months later ( ). \n\nLower FC in the DMN, salience network, dorsal attention network, and orbitofrontal network was predictive for worse attention six months later ( ). Furthermore, higher FC between the basal ganglia and orbitofrontal network was predictive for worse attention performance ( ). \n\n\n\n#### Arterial spin labeling \n  \nCharacteristics and results of studies on arterial spin labeling measures are summarized in Online Resource Table S8. This class was only investigated after TBI. \n\n##### Associations \n  \nDecreased cerebral blood flow in regions of interest (regions with lower cerebral blood flow in patients than in healthy controls) was associated with worse executive functioning ( ). \n\n\n##### Prediction \n  \nDecreased cerebral blood flow in regions of interest was not predictive for memory or executive functioning at six to twelve months ( ). \n\n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWith this systematic review and meta-analysis we provide an overview of MRI factors associated with or predictive for (impairments of) memory, attention, or executive functioning after acute onset brain injury. Our results show that hippocampal volume, fractional anisotropy in multiple regions, and functional connectivity within the default-mode network were associated with in cross-sectional studies ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and predictive for (impairments of) function in these cognitive domains in longitudinal studies ( ,  ,  ). Due to the low number of studies included in meta-analyses and high heterogeneity of studies, evidence is weak. \n\nOur results show that smaller brain volumes and larger ventricles have been associated with and were predictive for worse cognitive performance. Especially lower hippocampal volume has repeatedly been associated with worse memory ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Since included studies could not compare post-injury with pre-injury results, it is unclear whether volume changes caused by the injury or preexistent atrophy was studied. However, since multiple studies found consonant results regardless of the MRI timing, volumes of the hippocampus and other target regions are probably an important determinant of post-injury memory (impairments). \n\nDiffusion-tensor imaging showed that lower FA in multiple white matter tracts, especially in cingulum and fornix, was associated with worse cognition ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). FA has mainly been investigated in patients with TBI, so associations after acute onset brain injury from other causes are unclear. Lower FA indicates less intact white matter tracts and low FA values in our study population probably indicate injury induced white matter damage ( ). Results of a longitudinal predictive study on diffusivity measures showed that higher anisotropy and lower diffusivity were predictive for worse attention performance, while in cross-sectional studies higher anisotropy and lower diffusivity were always associated with worse performance ( ). \n\nLower FC within the DMN was associated with worse cognitive performance ( ,  ,  ,  ). Of all resting state networks, the DMN was studied most. The DMN comprises the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, inferior parietal lobe, lateral temporal cortex, and hippocampal formation ( ). Although the precise function of the DMN is incompletely understood, it has been established that this network is involved in multiple cognitive functions ( ). This applies to connectivity within the network ( ) as well as for the individual brain areas belonging to the network. The posterior cingulate cortex is involved in memory encoding and consolidation ( ), while the medial prefrontal cortex participates in error identification ( ). Acute onset brain injury may affect nodes of the DMN as well as inter-nodal connections. \n\nResults of three other classes of MRI measures were not straightforward. The association between lesion volume and cognitive performance was inconsistent ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Signs of small vessel disease showed conflicting results. Some studies showed significant correlations ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), while other did not ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). This type of abnormality is mostly chronic and preexistent ( ). Arterial spin labeling was only investigated in one study ( ). \n\nOur review shows that results from longitudinal predictive studies are not always in accordance with those from cross-sectional studies. This indicates the need for longitudinal studies on potential MRI markers that may predict (impairments of) cognition, since cross-sectional studies are not sufficient. \n\nOur results are consistent with studies in neurodegenerative diseases, where lower fractional anisotropy ( ), lower FC within the DMN ( ), and lower hippocampal volume ( ) were associated with poorer cognitive performance, as well. \n\nThe broad scope of this review allowed inclusion of a large variability in study populations, studied MRI markers, neuropsychological tests, and timing of MRI and neuropsychological testing, causing substantial heterogeneity across the included studies. Since neuroplasticity and recovery take place on the timescale of weeks or months after acute onset brain injury ( ,  ), time between onset and MRI or cognitive testing possibly confounded the associations and predictive values described in this review. This review comprised several studies that included the same patients and imaging modalities, which might have led to overestimation of some associations between MRI factors and cognitive outcome measures. However, our meta-analyses never included two studies based on the same data. \n\nA particular strength of this review is the inclusion of studies using neuropsychological tests with known psychometric quality and validity in the acute brain injury population only. We excluded new tests, screening tools, or tests mainly used in research settings. A limitation is that possibilities to perform meta-analyses were limited, because of heterogeneity of the included studies and selective reporting of results. Furthermore, studies eligible for meta-analysis all but two had small sample sizes (n\u00a0\u2264 40). Although missing data were requested, we may overestimate the pooled correlations in our meta-analyses. \n\nUltimately, we would want to be able to predict long-term cognitive impairments based on early screening of patients after acute onset brain injury. Based on the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis, some major challenges remain. First, most studies were cross-sectional. Longitudinal studies are needed to be able to predict long-term cognitive outcome based on early screening. Our review shows that longitudinal studies on early MRI markers predictive for long-term cognition were scarce. Grouping and quantifying these results was not possible because no MRI marker was studied longitudinally more than once. International experts recommend early cognitive screening in order to provide cognitive rehabilitation therapy ( ,  ,  ). Second, the additional value of MRI, on top of other potential predictors, such as demographic or neuropsychological measures, has not been addressed. Research has mainly focused on finding group differences and correlations, without taking other possible predictors into account. Third, most studies looked into cognitive functioning instead of impairments. Finally, cut off values of the various proposed MRI markers for predicting impairments in the individual patient are lacking, and external validation of results has not been performed. Future research may focus on finding cut off values of early MRI markers for prediction of long-term cognitive impairments in individual patients and external validation of results. \n\nIn conclusion, hippocampal volume, fractional anisotropy in cingulum and fornix, and functional connectivity within the default-mode network are associated with (impairments of) memory, attention, and executive functioning after acute onset brain injury. For clinical implementation, more research is needed on early predictive values of these MRI markers, external validation of results, and cut off values for prediction of long-term cognitive impairments in individual patients. \n\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest \n  \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 10165272, "text_md5": "df78ccc05204c0f9eabcdb59de453d35", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 128], "journal": [129, 144], "publication_year": [146, 150], "title": [161, 278], "keywords": [292, 421], "abstract": [434, 2515], "body": [2524, 31860]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 37119695, "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2023.103415", "pmcid": "10165272", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10165272", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10165272"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10165272\">10165272</a>", "list_title": "PMC10165272  MRI factors associated with cognitive functioning after acute onset brain injury: Systematic review and meta-analysis"}
