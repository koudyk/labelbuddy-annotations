However, the pattern of their effects on neural activity in various brain regions in both clinical and healthy populations is still not well understood, and primary studies addressing this issue have sometimes generated inconsistent results. \n\n\n## Objectives \n  \nThe present meta-analysis aims to advance our understanding of the most widely used serotonergic psychedelics \u2013 LSD, psilocybin, and MDMA \u2013 by examining their effects on the functional activation throughout the whole brain among both clinical and healthy participants. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe conducted this meta-analysis by applying multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) with ensemble thresholding to quantitatively combine existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that examined whole-brain functional activation of clinical or healthy participants who were administered a serotonergic psychedelic. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nSerotonergic psychedelics, including LSD, psilocybin, and MDMA, exhibited significant effects (\u03b1=0.05) on neural activation in several regions throughout the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia, including effects that may be common across and unique within each drug. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThese observed effects of serotonergic psychedelics on neural activity advance our understanding of the functional neuroanatomy associated with their administration and may inform future studies of both their adverse and therapeutic effects, including emerging clinical applications for the treatment of several psychiatric disorders. \n\n\n## Disclosure of Interest \n  \nNone Declared \n\n \n\n# Body\n\n", "metadata": {"id": 10417748, "text_md5": "2d413739f27342e7d91a0e38e9871727", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 234], "journal": [235, 249], "publication_year": [251, 255], "title": [266, 388], "keywords": [402, 402], "abstract": [415, 2254], "body": [2263, 2263]}, "batch": 1, "doi": "10.1192/j.eurpsy.2023.1948", "pmcid": "10417748", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10417748", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10417748"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10417748\">10417748</a>", "list_title": "PMC10417748  The Effects of Serotonergic Psychedelics on Neural Activity: A Meta-Analysis of Task-Based Functional Neuroimaging Studies"}
