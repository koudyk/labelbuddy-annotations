BMACS offers a fast, accurate, and accessible inference of the spatial patterns of cognitive processes from peak brain activations across studies by applying spatial point processes to the cortical surface. Using BMACS, we found that the common pattern of activations from inductive and deductive reasoning was colocalized with the multiple-demand system, indicating that reasoning is a high-level convergence of complex cognitive processes. We hope surface-based meta-analysis will be facilitated by BMACS, bringing more profound knowledge of various cognitive processes.
