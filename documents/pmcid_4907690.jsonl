Combining functional neuroimaging with multivariate pattern analyses, we identified dissociable patterns that predicted somatic (high versus low: 100%) and vicarious (high versus low: 100%) pain intensity in out-of-sample individuals. Critically, each pattern was at chance in predicting the other experience, demonstrating separate modifiability of both patterns. Somatotopy (upper versus lower limb: 93% accuracy for both conditions) was also distinct, located in somatosensory versus mentalizing-related circuits for somatic and vicarious pain, respectively. Two additional studies demonstrated the generalizability of the somatic pain pattern (which was originally developed on thermal pain) to mechanical and electrical pain, and also demonstrated the replicability of the somatic/vicarious dissociation. These findings suggest possible mechanisms underlying limitations in feeling others\u2019 pain, and present new, more specific, brain targets for studying pain empathy. \n\n DOI:  \n   eLife digest  \nThe ability to experience others\u2019 pain is a cornerstone of empathy, and binds us together in times of hardship. However, we have not yet fully understood the complex interactions in the brain that make people empathetic to others\u2019 suffering. One possibility is that we experience others\u2019 pain through the activation of the same brain regions as those that enable us to experience physical pain ourselves. \n\nTo test this idea, Krishnan et al. compared patterns of brain activity in human volunteers as they experienced pain (from heat being applied to their forearm or foot) or watched images of others\u2019 hands or feet being injured. While watching these images, the volunteers were asked to try to imagine that the injuries were happening to their own bodies. \n\nThe patterns of brain activity that arose when the volunteers observed someone else in pain did not overlap with the patterns produced when the volunteers experienced pain themselves. Instead, seeing someone else in pain activated regions involved in taking another person\u2019s perspective. This process, which is known as mentalizing, involves thinking about the other person\u2019s thoughts, intentions and preferences. Thus within the brain, the experience of observing someone else in pain is distinct from that of experiencing physical pain in oneself. \n\nThe results presented by Krishnan et al. raise new questions about how the brain regions involved in empathy help us to relate to other people when they experience different types of pain. Future studies should explore the factors that influence our ability to adopt another\u2019s perspective, and whether it might be possible to improve this ability. \n\n DOI:  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n   \n\u201cThough our brother is upon the rack, as long as we ourselves are at our ease, our senses will never inform us of what he suffers. \u2026 it is by the imagination only that we can form any conception of what are his sensations.\u201d \n \nA fundamental feature of social interactions is our capacity for vicarious experience\u2014the ability to perceive another person\u2019s affective state, reference it to ourselves, and generate an emotional response. This ability provides the foundation for empathy and cooperative behavior ( ) by allowing us to recognize and respond to suffering in others ( ), and learn from their experiences ( ). Vicarious experiences of others\u2019 pain, in particular, aid in representing others\u2019 distress with sufficient vividness and importance that we are moved to action. \n\nBut how do we represent others\u2019 pain, and how vivid and automatic are such representations? Theories differ markedly on this point. One theory suggests that vicarious pain involves   shared experience  , activating neural circuits that represent somatic pain in the perceiver. Such theories are based largely on overlapping activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insular (aINS) cortices when both experiencing pain and observing pain in others ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Such overlaps have also been found in primary and secondary somatosensory areas [i.e., SI and SII] ( ;  ;  ;  ). Witnessing others in pain can increase one\u2019s own pain ( ;  ), and placebos given for somatic pain can also reduce vicarious \u2018pain\u2019 ( ). Together, these findings have been taken as brain evidence for shared representation of pain. In particular, dACC and aINS activation are thought to reflect a kind of shared experience that has been described in terms of 'neural resonance' ( ), and as 'automatic' ( ). By this account, empathy is 'built   bottom up   from relatively simple mechanisms of action production and perception' ( ). \n\nAnother theory suggests that vicarious pain may be primarily a reflective, cognitive experience whose experiential qualities are hard to mimic or simulate directly ( ;  ;  ;  ). Others\u2019 pain need not activate somatic pain representations to be aversive ( ), and empathy may work by engaging other emotional systems apart from \u2018pain in oneself\u2019 ( ). Unlike somatic pain, vicarious pain is all too easy to ignore. For example, many participants will inflict substantial pain on an innocent person when instructed to do so by authority figures ( ;  ). We also ignore our own past and future pain ( ;  ;  ), making decisions in line with our goals when pain is distant but often reversing those choices when pain is imminent. \n\nBrain evidence also suggests that vicarious pain may rely on circuits specialized for representing the thoughts and intentions of others ( ;  ;  ). A network encompassing the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex [dmPFC], posterior cingulate cortex [PCC], temporal-parietal junction [TPJ], and superior temporal sulcus [STS; ( ;  ;  )] is reliably involved in \u2018mentalizing\u2019\u2014thinking about others\u2019 thoughts ( ), preferences ( ), and intentions ( )\u2014and in imagining one\u2019s own and others\u2019 responses to painful stimuli ( ;  ). This \u2018mentalizing\u2019 network is distinct from both pain-related circuitry and circuitry thought to underlie shared affective experiences and actions, including the dACC and aINS ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nA critical question in assessing shared representation is whether the overlapping brain activity observed really reflects shared   pain-related   processes. Several recent lines of evidence suggest this may not be the case. In a meta-analysis of over 3500 neuroimaging studies available from Neurosynth.org, activation in the aINS and dACC were among the most frequently observed findings across all kinds of tasks ( ), suggesting that activation in these regions frequently has nothing to do with pain. It is possible that activity in portions of the\u00a0dACC is   preferentially   related to pain on average; for example,   used Neurosynth.org to identify a statistical association between studies using the term 'pain' and activation of the dACC. However, this does not mean that dACC activity is sufficient to infer pain, as the dACC responds to a variety of cognitive and emotional events that are not painful ( ). For instance, electrophysiological and optogenetic studies have identified neurons engaged during foraging behavior, attention, emotion, reward expectancy, skeletomotor and visceromotor activity, and other functions ( ;  ;  ). \u2018Pain-encoding\u2019 portions of the dACC can be activated in individuals with a congenital insensitivity to pain ( ). Only a small minority of dACC neurons are pain-related ( ;  ), and the dACC encodes emotional events, including rejection and general negative emotion, in a way that is distinct from how it encodes pain ( ;  ). More fine-grained analyses of population-level representations are required to make inferences about pain based on activity in the dACC and other regions. \n\nIn this study, we attempted to identify representations (or markers) for somatic and vicarious pain\u2014both within the\u00a0dACC and aINS and across the brain\u2014and test their similarity. For a marker (e.g., a multivariate brain pattern) to serve as a representation of pain, it should satisfy three criteria. It should: a) closely track pain experience (be   sensitive   to the presence of pain); b) not respond to experiences that are defined as non-painful (be pain-  specific  ); and c) generalize across multiple forms of pain ( ). Only to the degree that brain patterns   represent   somatic and vicarious pain does testing their similarity bear on shared representation theories. Previous studies [e.g.,( ;  )] have compared the similarity of self-pain and other-pain patterns, but these patterns have not shown strong sensitivity to pain experience [criterion (  a  ) above]. Indeed, prior work has suggested that sensitivity to pain and emotional experiences requires combining signals across brain regions and networks ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), whereas previous studies of vicarious pain have focused only on local patterns within a single region at a time. In addition, the patterns identified as shared across self- and other-pain have responded to other types of negative emotion (e.g., emotional pictures, disgust, and unfairness), and so do not satisfy criterion (  b  ) for pain representations. Finally, no vicarious pain studies have tested generalizability of a specific brain pattern across types of pain [criterion (  c  )]. \n\nHere, in Study 1, we used a 3 (stimulation level) \u00d7 2 (body site) \u00d7 2 (pain modality; i.e., somatic vs. vicarious) experimental design, with pain reports after each trial, to identify patterns that predicted the level of reported somatic and vicarious pain in response to painful heat and observation of pain in others, respectively. Between-participant machine learning analyses were used to identify patterns that test   sensitivity   [i.e., satisfy criterion (  a  )\u00a0above] for both pain modalities (i.e., somatic vs. vicarious), and to provide an unbiased test of similarity and cross-prediction across somatic and vicarious pain predictive patterns. In addition, we tested somatotopy (upper versus lower limb) within sensory cortices and other systems for both pain modalities, and compared the somatotopic representations. The identification of patterns that can be generalized across participants allowed us to test the specificity [criterion (  b  )], and generalizability [criterion (  c  )] of these patterns in additional studies. \n\nPrevious work has identified a pattern that is, thus far, sensitive and specific [criteria (  a  ) and (  b  ) above] for somatic pain across multiple studies. We used this pattern, called the Neurologic Pain Signature [NPS; ( )], in our primary analyses, and attempted to identify a parallel pattern for vicarious pain. The NPS has over 90% sensitivity and specificity in predicting somatic pain relative to several other salient states, including non-painful warmth, anticipated pain, pain recall ( ), social rejection ( ), and general negative emotion ( ). In the current paper, Study 2 and Study 3 tested the generalizability of the NPS to mechanical and electrical pain, respectively [addressing criterion (  c  ) above]. Study 3 also provided a replication of the sensitivity, specificity, and similarity of somatic and vicarious pain predictive patterns. Our primary goal was to identify\u2014and test the similarity of\u2014whole-brain patterns for somatic and vicarious pain that generalize across individuals and can be tested prospectively in multiple studies. However, we also conducted analyses focused on the dACC and aINS specifically, and on pain-predictive patterns identified for each individual participant. In addition, we conducted \u2018searchlight\u2019 analyses designed to test the maximal similarity of local brain patterns related to somatic and vicarious pain across the brain, and provide inferences on whether distributed, whole-brain patterns are necessary to capture representations of both somatic and vicarious pain. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Reported intensity \n  \nIn Study 1, for the   somatic pain   condition, participants were scanned using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (  f  MRI) while they experienced three levels of thermal pain (46, 47 or 48\u00b0C;  ) on their left volar forearm (the \u2018upper limb or UL\u2019 site) and left dorsal foot (the \u2018lower limb or LL\u2019 site), and rated the intensity of pain with their right hand following every trial. In the   vicarious pain   condition, participants were scanned while they viewed images depicting injury to others\u2019 right hands (the \u2018upper limb or UL\u2019 site) and feet (the \u2018lower limb or LL\u2019 site) and engaged in perspective-taking ( ;  )\u2014participants imagined that the injuries were happening to their own bodies\u2014to actively reference the observed pain to their own bodies.    Experimental paradigm and behavioral results.  \n(  A  ) Trial timeline for somatic and vicarious pain sessions (differing only by stimulation type and fixation jitter, see 'Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods' for more details); (  B  ) Averaged behavioral ratings for somatic and vicarious pain across levels of stimulation and body site (i.e., upper limb and lower limb; including within-participant standard error of the mean). \n\n DOI:  \n  \n\nParticipants reported increased intensity with increasing levels of somatic pain for both upper limb and lower limb sites with no significant difference between body sites (  t  (27) = 12.93 p<0.0001,   t  (27) = 10.36, p<0.0001,   t  (27) = 1.08,   n.s.  ;  ). Participants also reported increasing intensity with increasing levels of vicarious pain for both upper limb and lower limb sites, with no significant difference between sites (  t  (27) = 11.99, p<0.0001,   t  (27) = 11.37, p<0.0001,   t  (27) = 1.49,   n.s.  ;  ). Intensity ratings were robust and comparable for both somatic and vicarious pain conditions, with no significant difference between mean behavioral ratings for both types of experiences (  t  (27) = \u22120.05,   n.s  ). \n\n\n### The NPS is sensitive and specific to somatic pain \n  \nTo test whether activity in the NPS pattern ( ) tracked both somatic and vicarious pain intensity, we calculated the NPS pattern response [the weighted average activation; ( )] for each single-participant activation map (regression parameter estimate maps from single-participant general linear models) for each condition (3 stimulation levels \u00d7 2 body sites \u00d7 2 pain modalities [i.e., somatic vs. vicarious]). This provided a measure of the NPS pattern activation in each condition for each participant, which we analyzed for effects of stimulation level within each body site and for differences across body sites and pain modalities.    Neurologic pain signature (NPS) pattern and analyses.  \n(  A  ) Between-participant thresholded (False\u00a0Discovery\u00a0Rate [FDR] q<0.05) Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS) pattern ( ), (all voxels within the NPS were used in the\u00a0analyses), examples of unthresholded patterns are presented in the insets; small squares indicate voxel weights, black squares indicate empty voxels located outside of the NPS pattern, and red-outlined squares indicate significance at FDR q<0.05; (  B  )\u00a0Signature responses computed as the dot product of the NPS pattern weights and estimated activation maps for each participant (including within-participant error bars); (  C  )\u00a0Receiver Operating\u00a0Characteristic (ROC) curves for two-choice forced-alternative accuracies for somatic and vicarious pain, high and low somatic pain, and high and low vicarious pain; (  D  ) Participant-Wise NPS Responses for (  I  ) somatic and vicarious pain (accuracy    = 100%, p<0.0001), (  II  ) high and low somatic pain (accuracy    = 100%, p<0.0001), and (  III  ) high and low vicarious pain (accuracy    = 32%,   n.s.  ), showing the direction of response for each participant. \n\n DOI:  \n  \n\nThe NPS response increased monotonically for each level of somatic pain for both upper limb and lower limb sites (  t  (27) = 9.08, p<0.0001, accuracy   = 100%, p<0.0001;   t  (27) = 8.88, p<0.0001, accuracy    = 100%, p<0.0001; see  . The NPS response was slightly reduced on the lower limb site (  t  (27) = 2.13, p<0.05; see  ), but this difference was not significant after controlling for rated intensity, implying that the NPS response magnitude is consistent with the reported intensity across both sites. \n\nImportantly, the NPS response did not increase across levels of vicarious pain on either site (  t  (27) = \u22121.57,   n.s., t  (27) = \u22121.99,   n.s., t  (27) = 1.71,   n.s.  ; see  ). Individual participants also showed the same pattern of NPS responses for both somatic and vicarious pain ( ). \n\nThere was a strong de-activation in the NPS response for all vicarious pain conditions, with levels below zero. This decrease was driven by picture-induced activation of regions negatively predictive of pain in the NPS (e.g., ventral occipital cortex, superior temporal sulcus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex; see Appendix and   for additional details). \n\nAdditional analyses re-training a new somatic pain pattern on this dataset showed similar results (see Appendix and   for more details) but the NPS is preferred because it was defined   a priori   and its specificity was\u00a0validated across multiple datasets. \n\n\n### A novel signature sensitive and specific to vicarious pain \n  \nWe next sought to identify a distributed pattern of   f  MRI activity that predicts the intensity of vicarious pain experience (i.e., Vicarious Pain Signature or VPS). To parallel the development of the NPS ( ), we used LASSO-PCR (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator-regularized Principal Components Regression) to predict the intensity of reported vicarious pain during pain observation ( ). We used a leave-one-participant-out cross-validation (see 'Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods' for details;   shows the thresholded VPS map using a bootstrap procedure) to get\u00a0an unbiased test of responses to both somatic and vicarious pain in held-out individuals.    Vicarious pain signature (VPS) pattern and analyses.  \n(  A  ) Between-participant LASSO-PCR (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator-regularized Principal Components Regression) derived pattern for the Vicarious Pain Signature (VPS), and bootstrap thresholded at FDR q<0.05 for display purposes (all voxels within the VPS were used in the\u00a0analyses), examples of unthresholded patterns are presented in the insets; small squares indicate voxel weights, and red or blue-outlined squares indicate significance at FDR q<0.05; (  B  ) Cross-validated signature responses computed from the VPS as the dot product of the VPS pattern weights with the estimated activation maps for each participant (including within-participant standard error of the mean); (  C  ) Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for two-choice forced-alternative accuracies for vicarious and somatic pain, high and low somatic pain, and high and low vicarious pain; (  D  ) Participant-Wise VPS Responses for (  I  ) vicarious and somatic pain (accuracy    = 89%, p<0.0001), (  II  ) high and low vicarious pain (accuracy    = 100%, p<0.0001), and (  III  ) high and low somatic pain (accuracy    = 64%,   n.s.  ), showing the direction of response for each participant. \n\n DOI:  \n  \n\nThe VPS responded strongly and monotonically to increases in vicarious pain for both upper limb and lower limb sites (  t  (27) = 7.42, p<0.0001, accuracy   =   89%, p<0.0001;   t  (27) = 10.44, p<0.0001, accuracy   =   100%, p<0.0001;  ), with a reduced response for the lower limb site (  t  (27)=2.83, p<0.05). Importantly, the VPS showed near-zero responses for all levels of somatic pain, and did not differentiate between somatic pain levels (  t  (27) = 1.39,   n.s., t  (27) = 0.84,   n.s., t  (27) = 0.33,   n.s.  ; see  ). Individual participants also showed the same pattern of VPS responses for both somatic and vicarious pain ( ). \n\nTo test how strongly the VPS\u2019s sensitivity and specificity depended on occipital activation\u2014which might be related to enhanced sensory attention\u2014we re-trained the VPS excluding the occipital cortex, with qualitatively identical results (see Appendix and   for more details). The signature response monotonically increased for each level of vicarious pain for both the upper limb and lower limb sites (  t  (27) = 5.75, p<0.0001,   t  (27) = 5.45, p<0.0001, accuracy    = 93%, p<0.0001), but did not differentiate between high and low levels of somatic pain (  t  (27) = 1.56,   n.s., t  (27) = 1.23,   n.s.; t  (27) = 0.03,   n.s.  , accuracy    = 64%,   n.s.  ). \n\nAdditionally, we examined whether the observed differences between the NPS and VPS patterns were due to differences in the lateralization of stimuli presentation. As in the studies used to define and validate the NPS, somatic pain was administered on the left limbs. Likewise, as in previous literature, the visual stimuli used to evoke vicarious pain showed injuries to the right limbs. This mirrors the side of painful stimulation from the observer\u2019s point of view in an allocentric reference frame, but not an egocentric one; thus, laterality could conceivably play a role. To test this, we repeated the signature response analysis with a left-right flipped version of the VPS pattern (excluding the occipital cortex), which preserves the pattern but with opposite laterality. The results remained the same: The flipped VPS pattern did not track somatic pain intensity (  t  (27) = 1.47,   n.s., t  (27) = 0.04,   n.s.  , accuracy    = 50%,   n.s.  ), but did track vicarious pain intensity (  t  (27) = 2.68, p<0.05,   t  (27) = 2.53, p<0.05, accuracy    = 79%, p<0.005). These results indicate that the laterality of the VPS, and by extension the laterality of the stimuli it was trained on, are not an important determinant of its functional properties. \n\n\n### Somatic and vicarious pain: encoded in dissociable brain systems \n  \nAs described above, each of the two patterns we identified (the NPS and VPS) was influenced by only one type of \u2018pain\u2019 induction: Somatic pain induced intensity-dependent responses in the NPS only, and vicarious pain induced intensity-dependent responses in the VPS only. This pattern of results shows   separate modifiability   of these patterns, a strong inferential criterion by which two processes are functionally independent if experimental manipulations can modify each pattern without affecting the other one ( ). It rules out common influences of general shared processes such as increased allocation of attention [e.g., ( )]. \n\nIn addition, the two patterns were anatomically distinct. Regions in the NPS that most reliably predicted somatic pain included aINS, dACC, dorso-posterior insula (dpINS), and SII. By contrast, VPS regions encoding vicarious pain included the\u00a0dmPFC, amygdala, PCC, and TPJ. Moreover, the predictive weights in the NPS and VPS were orthogonal, showing near-zero spatial correlations across the brain (  r   = \u22120.03; 104,360 voxels in the NPS & VPS) and within key regions (see below). \n\nAdditional analyses showed that both the NPS and VPS were activated in response to the somatic or vicarious pain stimulus specifically during the stimulation period, with the expected time course. Both the NPS and VPS responded only during somatic and vicarious pain events, respectively, with no anticipatory activity ( ). There were small differences in the time courses of responses to somatic and vicarious pain, which are expected because somatic pain summates across time and peaks after stimulus offset ( ), whereas vicarious pain does not have this physiological property. Critically, we found no evidence for \u2018off-target\u2019 responses (VPS responses to somatic pain or NPS responses to vicarious pain) at any point during the trial.    Trial-Level finite-impulse response (FIR) analyses.  \n(  A  ) Stimulus-related activity for the NPS and VPS for somatic and vicarious pain (including within-participant standard error of the mean (shading), where the green bar shows stimulus duration; (  B  )\u00a0Anticipatory (cue-locked) activity for the NPS and VPS for somatic and vicarious pain (including within-participant error (shading), where the green bars show stimulus duration after a jittered pre-stimulus anticipatory fixation. \n\n DOI:  \n  \n\nAnother issue that may make the NPS and VPS responses appear more dissimilar is differential habituation or sensitization across trials. To test this, we estimated NPS and VPS amplitudes for each trial using a \u2018beta series\u2019 approach ( ) and examined their stability across trials. We did not see any evidence for systematic variation [e.g., sensitization or habituation; ( )] across trials (see Appendix and  ). \n\nAdditionally, we tested whether the VPS pattern was similar to whole-brain patterns we identified as related to (a) romantic rejection ( ) and (b) negative emotion induced by affective pictures ( ), two other types of aversive experience. The VPS was uncorrelated with either pattern (  r   = \u22120.03 and   r   = 0.03, respectively), demonstrating that the signature for vicarious pain is not a marker for general negative emotion, unlike previous results ( ), and supporting the specificity of the VPS for pain empathy. \n\n\n### Dissociable local representations for \u2018pain affect\u2019 \n  \nTheories of pain empathy have focused on the dACC and aINS as critical for shared representations of pain affect, and emphasize overlapping activity in spite of differences in the sensory system involved (e.g., somatic vs. visual). Like previous work ( ;  ;  ), we found strong activation in these regions in both somatic and vicarious pain in standard univariate analyses ( ). We identified regions of overlapping activation in the dACC and aINS ( ), and tested the similarity and separate modifiability of the pain-predictive patterns only within these \u2018shared\u2019 regions.    Univariate general linear model analyses and multivariate pattern comparisons.  \n(  A  ) group level general linear model (GLM) analyses for somatic and vicarious pain. (I.): GLM results for somatic pain against baseline thresholded at FDR q<0.01; (II.): GLM results for vicarious pain against baseline thresholded at FDR q<0.01; (  B  ) General Linear Model (GLM) results for somatic pain (in orange) and vicarious pain (in purple) against baseline, thresholded at FDR q<0.01 with overlap in the statistically significant regions (FDR q<0.01) between somatic and vicarious pain shown in yellow (these overlapping regions were used for further within-participant cross-prediction analyses); (  C  ) Pattern comparison within the anterior insula (aINS) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) for the NPS and VPS (black squares in the pattern mask indicate empty voxels not included for the analysis); correlation values are computed using all overlapping voxels in the dACC and bilateral aINS voxels (only right aINS shown for display). \n\n DOI:  \n  \n\nThe NPS and VPS pattern weights within the aINS and dACC were negatively correlated (aINS:   r   = \u22120.31 [349 Voxels]; dACC:   r   = \u22120.41 [1,125 Voxels]; see  ), indicating a lack of positive shared representation. Additionally, we used data from each region of interest (ROI) to train local patterns predictive of somatic and vicarious pain intensity within individual participants. These patterns were also spatially uncorrelated within each region (aINS: mean   r   = 0.0185 \u00b1 0.0092,   n.s.  ; dACC: mean   r   = 0.0350 \u00b1 0.0195,   n.s.  ). Further analyses indicated that both dACC and aINS successfully tracked somatic pain (cross-validated accuracy   for aINS: 89%, p<0.0001; dACC: 75%, p<0.01). Vicarious pain, however, showed marginal within-modality classification (aINS: 71%, p<0.05; dACC: 57%,   n.s.  ), suggesting that local patterns may be insufficient to represent vicarious pain. Importantly, cross-prediction analyses showed that the somatic pain pattern did not predict vicarious pain intensity in both aINS and dACC, and vice versa (all accuracy values < 54%,   n.s.  ), demonstrating separate modifiability. Together, these results support the independence of somatic and vicarious pain representations in the aINS and dACC. In addition, they suggest that vicarious pain representation is distributed across regions, and can best be captured in whole-brain but not local analyses. \n\nFinally, we used within-individual searchlight analysis (8\u2009mm sphere) to test (a) whether any local region of the brain was highly predictive of somatic or vicarious pain, and (b) whether there was strong shared representation in any local region ( ).\u00a0The within-modality patterns exhibited a similar spatial topography to our whole-brain analyses (see  ), but no results for vicarious pain survived false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing. Importantly, the effect sizes even for the most predictive regions were an order of magnitude smaller than those observed in our whole brain analyses: The maximal within-modality effect size out of 181,129 local regions tested was   r   =\u00a00.06 for somatic pain and   r   =\u00a00.018 for vicarious pain. In addition, no cross-prediction results survived FDR correction, and the distribution of cross-prediction results across regions was centered on zero for both somatic and vicarious pain (see  ). Again, effect sizes across the brain were small: The largest effects were   r  =\u00a00.011 (somatic to vicarious) and   r   =\u00a00.017 (vicarious to somatic), indicating that local regions are insufficient by themselves to accurately predict ratings, and distributed patterns are required. Together, these results suggest that though there may be weak shared pattern information ( ;  ), local patterns in the aINS and dACC are insufficient to serve as representations for vicarious pain. In addition, separate cross-validated prediction analyses within-individuals revealed that whole brain spatial patterns predictive of somatic and vicarious pain were spatially uncorrelated (mean   r   = 0.0055 \u00b1 0.0065\u2009S.E.,   n.s.  ; see Appendix and  ).

However, our experimental design also allowed us to identify body-site specific representations and provide a preliminary comparison of the somatotopic organization of somatic and vicarious pain. Shared somatotopic organization (e.g., if vicarious pain on the upper limb activated upper limb-specific somatosensory regions) would provide evidence for shared representation, while divergent somatotopy would provide further evidence for differential brain representation. \n\nWe trained between-participant support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to differentiate between upper and lower limb sites separately for somatic and vicarious pain (we also performed within-participant SVM classification for completeness, with the same results; see Appendix for details). We then compared the body site-predictive maps across somatic and vicarious pain. The leave-one-participant-out SVM classifier successfully discriminated somatic pain on upper limb (UL) versus lower limb (LL) sites (see  ;   t  (27) = 6.90, p<0.0001; accuracy   = 93%, p<0.0001). The regions that made reliable contributions to classification (as tested with a bootstrap procedure; see 'Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods' for details) paralleled the somatotopy identified in previous literature, including specific regions of contralateral SI, mid INS, and dpINS ( ;  ;  ;  ). For vicarious pain, SVM classification also discriminated UL versus LL (see  ;   t  (27) = 6.12, p<0.0001; accuracy   = 93%, p<0.0001; within-participant average accuracy   = 100%, p<0.0001). Crucially, the somatotopic patterns for vicarious pain did not include the expected topography in contralateral SI, SII, mid-INS or dpINS, in either hemisphere ( ). Instead, vicarious pain somatotopy was represented in other brain areas, including the supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate (ACC), and medial prefrontal (mPFC) cortices (see Appendix and   for additional analyses).    Upper limb versus lower limb multivariate patterns for somatic and vicarious pain.  \n(  A  ) Accuracy statistics for upper limb versus lower limb weight maps for somatic and vicarious pain; Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for two-choice forced alternative tests for upper versus lower limb sites; (  B  ) Support Vector Machine (SVM) derived pattern for upper limb versus lower limb sites for somatic and vicarious pain, bootstrap thresholded at FDR q<0.05 for display purposes, showing somatotopy for these sites in the primary somatosensory cortex (schematic of homunculus shown for reference); (  C  ) SVM derived pattern for upper limb versus lower limb sites for somatic and vicarious pain, bootstrap thresholded at FDR q<0.05 for display purposes, showing somatotopy for these sites in the mid- and dorsal-posterior insular cortex (warm colors indicate upper limb regions and cool colors indicate lower limb sites). \n\n DOI:  \n  \n\nThus, somatotopy was apparent for both somatic and vicarious pain and strongly predictive of upper versus lower limb stimulation, but the   f  MRI patterns were qualitatively distinct in each condition. Somatotopy is the primary way of identifying somatosensory cortical representations ( ); thus, our preliminary finding of the expected somatotopy for somatic pain but not vicarious pain suggests that vicarious pain does not involve re-activation of somatosensory representations. Rather, body site-specific representations of vicarious pain may be accomplished using the mPFC \u2018mentalizing\u2019 system and perhaps other ideomotor systems. \n\n\n### Replication and generalization (Study 2 and Study 3) \n  \nTo test the generalizability of the NPS across different types of noxious input, we analyzed data from two additional   f  MRI studies (Study 2 and Study 3) that used other types of somatic pain. Study 2 (N = 28) used mechanical pressure pain at two intensities\u20144\u2009kg/cm  and 6\u2009kg/cm \u2014applied on the right thumbnail. The NPS responded more strongly to high versus low pressure, demonstrating sensitivity to mechanical pain (  t  (27) = 3.12, p<0.005; accuracy   =   71%, p<0.05; see  ). The discrimination accuracy is limited here by the inclusion of relatively few trials (5 per condition). Nevertheless, these results show that the NPS successfully predicts intensity in the somatic pain regardless of the site of the stimulation or type of somatic pain.    NPS and VPS responses for Study 2 and Study 3.  \n(  A  ) Study 2 \u2013 NPS responses for mechanical (pressure pain) delivered at low\u00a0and high\u00a0intensities, (i.e., 4 kg/cm  and 6 kg/cm ) computed as the dot product of the NPS pattern weights and estimated activation maps for each participant (including within-participant standard error of the mean; total of five trials per level of stimulation per participant; (  B  ) Study 3   \u2013   NPS (right) and VPS (left) responses for electrodermal (electrical or\u00a0shock) pain and observed pain, computed as the dot product of the respective pattern weights for NPS (right) and VPS (left) and estimated activation maps for each participant (including within-participant standard error of the mean. \n\n DOI:  \n  \n\nStudy 3 (N = 15) used electrodermal (electrical or\u00a0shock) pain delivered to the left ankle, and also included an observed pain condition with visual stimuli depicting pain on upper and lower limbs. However, perspective-taking was not employed in this study\u2014the instructions emphasized observation only rather than engage in perspective-taking\u2014so VPS activation was expected to be weaker than in Study 1. The NPS responded more to shock pain than observed pain (  t  (14) = 5.58, p<0.0001; accuracy   =   100%, p<0.0001; see  , left). Conversely, the VPS responded to more to observed pain\u00a0than shock pain (  t  (14) = 3.05, p<0.005; accuracy   =   73%,   n.s.  ; see  , right). Thus, the findings from Study 3 show that the NPS and VPS dissociate somatic versus observed pain in an independent sample. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe ability to vicariously experience others\u2019 pain is critical for empathy and prosocial behavior. Neuroimaging can help understand   how   we represent others\u2019 suffering by testing whether vicarious pain activates the same neural\u00a0mechanisms as somatic pain, implying shared affective experience. Overlapping neural responses in the dACC and aINS ( ;  ;  ;  ) have been interpreted in terms of shared pain representations, but these responses may reflect emotions that are distinct from pain, and need not entail shared experience ( ;  ). The question of shared representation can only be addressed if brain markers that are sensitive, specific, and generalizable can be identified for both somatic and vicarious pain. Then, the similarity of those markers can be assessed. But can a representation of vicarious pain be identified, and if so, is it conserved across individuals so that it can be prospectively compared with somatic pain and related to empathetic behavior? Our findings suggest that the answer to this question is yes. Is this representation similar to that for somatic pain? Our findings suggest that the answer to this question is no. \n\nIn a series of analyses across 3 studies, we identified distinct   f  MRI patterns that encoded the intensity of somatic and vicarious experiences, suggesting that somatic and vicarious pain are distinct processes. Local brain patterns did not accurately predict somatic or vicarious pain experience. Instead, distributed patterns within and across multiple association regions strongly and separately predicted both somatic and vicarious pain. Somatic pain was encoded largely in the aINS, dACC, dpINS, and SII\u2014regions targeted by ascending nociceptive afferents ( ;  ) and thought to encode sensory and affective aspects of pain. By contrast, vicarious pain was encoded in portions of the dmPFC, amygdala, PCC, and TPJ\u2014multisensory, heteromodal regions associated with mentalizing ( ;  ;  ), consistent with other work emphasizing the importance of mentalizing systems in empathy ( ;  ;  ). These findings demonstrate separate modifiability ( ;  ), which entails sensitivity and specificity of each brain pattern to only one type of \u2018pain\u2019, and rules out common influences of shared demands on attention, \u2018salience,\u2019 \u2018arousal,\u2019 and other more general processes (see Appendix for an extended discussion). \n\nIn addition, strong somatotopy was found for both somatic and vicarious pain, though the somatotopic organization was very different for each. Somatic pain and touch have a well-established somatotopy in SI, SII, and dpINS ( ;  ;  ), which we observed here. Vicarious pain showed different somatotopic patterns that, interestingly, were localized within \u2018mentalizing\u2019 systems rather than somatosensory ones. \n\n### A departure from shared representation \n  \nMost previous studies of vicarious\u00a0pain point out its similarity with somatic pain, and it is thus widely believed that the two experiences rely on the same systems. Why are our findings and conclusions different? There are three main reasons. \n\nFirst, many previous studies focused only on the points of similarity\u2014mainly identified in two isolated brain regions, dACC and aINS\u2014ignoring dissimilarities [but cf. ( ), who write, 'our results reveal more differences than similarities\u2026' p. 2500]. Here, we aimed for an unbiased assessment of the two processes. \n\nSecond, most previous work has identified \u2018pain-related\u2019 activation by contrasting pain with loosely matched control conditions (e.g., neutral or innocuous stimuli). Overlapping activity in such contrasts may be caused by many processes that are not pain, including general negative affect, attention, and arousal [see ( ) for discussion]. Engagement of these processes may be responsible for the similar activation in previous work. By contrast, in our study, we attempted to isolate pain-relevant patterns that predicted the magnitude of experienced intensity, and examined the similarity of those patterns. \n\nThird, most previous studies focused on voxel-wise activation \u2018blobs,\u2019 rather than on multivariate patterns, which can be sensitive to information at finer spatial scales ( ), possibly even below the intrinsic resolution determined by the voxel size ( ). This property, combined with our experimental approach targeting within-person variations in pain intensity, suggests that the multivariate patterns we identified are more likely to reflect specific representations contained in meso-scale neural circuits. \n\nBased on our findings, we infer that the overlapping activation in the\u00a0dACC, aINS, and other areas is not related to shared pain experience. Interestingly, on close reading, the few previous multivariate pattern-based studies agree broadly with this interpretation. The brain patterns they identified as shared across somatic and vicarious pain were not specific to \u2018pain,\u2019 as these patterns were also activated by other, non-painful types of negative affect ( ;  ). As in our study, in these studies what is shared does not seem to be particular to pain per se. \n\n\n### Identifying representations: criteria and evidence \n  \nSomatic and vicarious pain experiences,   by definition  , are similar in some ways and different in others. They are similar in that they are both aversive, salient, and attention-capturing. They differ in their sensory input modalities (somatosensory versus visual) and likely many of the cognitive processes involved. Brain activity, including both regional activation and multivariate patterns, may reflect any or all of these processes. For this reason, it is necessary to test the similarity of the brain patterns that   most closely encode pain experiences of each type  . We have proposed three criteria for identifying patterns that may be used to make inferences about pain representation. Such patterns should be (a) sensitive to pain, and thus respond in proportion to its experience; (b) specific to pain, and not activated by non-painful events; and (c) generalizable across varied instances of the type of pain. For example, a brain pattern that encodes \u2018pain affect\u2019\u2014whether common to self- and other-pain or not\u2014should increase as pain affect increases,\u00a0and not respond to non-painful forms of negative emotion such as disgust ( ). Previous studies have identified both shared and dissimilar patterns of activity ( ;  ) in local dACC and aINS regions. Though an important step, these patterns have not been shown to track pain experience with meaningfully large effect sizes, and our findings here suggest that local regions are insufficient to do so. In addition, they have not identified a pattern that tracks \u2018pain affect\u2019 specifically and does not respond to other negative emotions. \n\nOur findings provide an advance because they identify patterns that are strongly predictive of pain experience. Though they do not test many other kinds of emotions, the patterns are demonstrably specific to either pain for oneself or another. In addition, a lack of correlations between the NPS, VPS, and patterns predictive of rejection and negative emotion further suggest that these patterns are not sensitive to general emotional arousal. Fortunately, the between-participant patterns we identified here can be prospectively tested for generalizability to other emotions and paradigms in future studies. Indeed, in an initial step towards broader generalizability, we showed that the sensitivity and specificity of both patterns generalize to new studies, and that our putative somatic pain representation, the NPS, generalizes across three types of somatic pain. \n\nThe fact that capturing vicarious pain experience requires identifying distributed patterns across large-scale networks is consistent with prior work suggesting that accurate predictions of pain and emotional experiences requires combining signals across brain regions and networks ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). This work fits in with evidence for   population coding   in motor processing ( ), spatial processing ( ), and other domains ( ;  ;  ). It also converges with views of somatic pain as represented by patterns across populations of neurons distributed across macroscopic brain regions ( ;  ;  ). Thus, it may be useful to explicitly consider population coding hypotheses in future studies, at both the   f  MRI and neural levels of analyses. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nOur approach is not biased towards or against finding common or distinct representations. It is grounded in widely accepted approaches to testing cross-stimulus type prediction ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, our approach is not guaranteed to be maximally sensitive to shared representations. Optimizing for shared representation would require using machine-learning approaches to predict pain in a modality-nonspecific fashion. Another important issue is individual differences in the experience of vicarious pain. Having established pain-predictive brain patterns as we do here, subsequent studies could include stimuli that are externally matched, and brain responses in the 'vicarious pain signature' are correlated meaningfully with empathy ratings across participants. In addition, the VPS could potentially be used to test clinical populations: for example, whether patients in chronic pain show greater (or lesser) responses to others\u2019 suffering. These questions are beyond the scope of the present study, but could be undertaken in future work. \n\nOur study used conditions designed to maximize the neural overlap between vicarious and somatic pain, by using \u2018painful\u2019 pictures previously demonstrated to induce stronger somatosensory activity\u2014and are thus potentially   more   somatic pain-like\u2014than other, \u2018cued empathy\u2019 paradigms ( ). In addition, we instructed participants to adopt a perspective-taking stance previously shown to enhance activation in dACC, aINS, and somatosensory cortex ( ). Further studies are needed to assess the impact of instructions, mental stance, and which aspects of pain (e.g., sensory, affective) are being evaluated on the activation of the VPS ( ), and to assess generalizability across different types of vicarious pain paradigms. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nThis work provides a specific target signature, the Vicarious Pain Signature (VPS), which can be used prospectively for empathy-related activity in future studies. The VPS may help us understand factors that promote or impair vicarious pain experience, and its impact on prosocial behavior ( ). \n\nPerceiving others\u2019 pain does not appear to recruit the same neural circuitry as experiencing the pain ourselves. Rather than recruiting our somatosensory system to understand another\u2019s pain, we use processes involved in representing another\u2019s mental state. The lack of direct representation of others\u2019 pain in somatic pain systems provides a mechanism for understanding why we might systematically under-weigh others\u2019 painful experiences, including their suffering ( ;  ;  ), and substantiates Adam Smith\u2019s insight from 250 years ago that our moral sentiments are grounded in our cognitive rather than sensory faculties. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nData from three different studies were used in this project. Study 1 was the primary study that was used to develop the methodology discussed in the paper. Study 2 and Study 3 were part of separate projects that involved clinical populations, but only data from the healthy normal\u00a0controls were used to validate the methodology from Study 1. \n\n Study 1  \u00a0(N = 28) is part of a large ongoing project examining cue-based expectation effects, and predictive errors for mismatched cue validity across multiple aversive modalities. However, here we focused on machine-learning based prediction of intensity of somatic and vicarious pain, and the predictive cue effects were designed to be orthogonal to the intensity of stimulation. Study 1 served as a training set for the vicarious pain signature (VPS), a somatic pain predictive pattern, and was also used to identify within-participant somatic and vicarious pain patterns. Study 1 additionally served as a test set for the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS). \n\n Study 2\u00a0  (N = 28) is part of a study on clinical pain sensitivity differences between healthy normal controls and patients with fibromyalgia [see ( ;  ;  ) for related published work]. Here, Study 2 served as a test set for the NPS to examine whether the NPS was sensitive and specific to a different type of somatic pain (i.e., mechanical pressure pain), and whether the pattern generalized to different body locations (i.e., the right thumbnail). \n\n Study 3\u00a0  (N = 15) is part of a study comparing the cognitive and affective processes for somatic and observed pain in healthy normal controls and patients diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Here, Study 3 served as a test set for both the NPS and VPS to examine whether these patterns dissociated somatic from observed pain conditions. In addition, Study 3 involved electrodermal (electrical or\u00a0shock) stimulation on the left ankle, which served as another test of the generalizability of the NPS across somatic\u00a0pain types and body sites. \n\n### Study 1 \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nThirty healthy, right-handed participants (Mean Age = 25.2 years, SD = 7.4 years, 12 Females) were recruited for a multiple session (i.e., somatic and vicarious pain) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. Participants completed an additional session on aversive (bitter) taste, which will be described in a separate manuscript. Two female participants did not complete the somatic pain session so the final sample size was 28. The order of sessions was counterbalanced, and there were no significant order effects between participants. All participants provided informed consent, and all experimental procedures were conducted with the approval of the Institutional Review Board of the University of Colorado Boulder. Preliminary eligibility of participants was determined through an online questionnaire, a pain safety screening form, and an   f  MRI safety screening form. Participants with psychiatric, physiological or pain disorders, and neurological conditions were excluded. \n\n\n#### Pain calibration \n  \nAll participants completed a pain calibration session to determine if they could tolerate the somatic stimulations that they would receive in the actual   f  MRI experiment. Somatic stimulation was administered as thermal pain, which was applied on the volar surface of the left forearm (i.e., upper limb) and dorsal surface of the left foot (i.e., lower limb)\u00a0using a TSA-II Neurosensory Analyzer (Medoc Ltd., Chapel Hill, NC) with a 16\u2009mm Peltier thermode end plate. Three levels of somatic stimulation (pseudo-randomly assigned to each participant)\u2014low (44 or 45\u00b0C), medium (46 or 47\u00b0C) and high (48 or 49\u00b0C)\u2014were applied to four different locations on both the upper limb and lower limb . Each stimulation lasted a total of 11s\u00a0with a 2s ramp-up and a 2s ramp down, and 7s at the peak target temperature. The participants made responses on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), which had anchors based on a labeled magnitude rating scale ( ;  ) for No Sensation (0% of scale length), Barely Detectable (1.4% of scale length), Weak (6.1% of scale length), Moderate (17.2% of scale length), Strong (35.4% of scale length), Very Strong (53.3% of scale length), and Strongest Imaginable Sensation (100% of scale length). Participants first made a moment-by-moment rating where for the duration of the trial, as they experienced any sensation, they used a pointer on the screen to move continuously along the rating scale and indicate the level of sensation they felt at each moment. They then made an overall rating at the end of each trial to indicate the maximum overall sensation they experienced in that trial. As part of the calibration procedure, participants also viewed pictures for 11s (to match the thermal pain trials) depicting varying levels of injury occurring on the right hand or foot ( ). Participants were given the instruction, 'Imagine the experience if the situation in each picture happened to you, and rate how much sensation you would feel in that situation'. They used the same visual analog scale as the somatic pain calibration to make their ratings\u2014a moment-by-moment rating while they viewed the picture and an overall rating about their experience after each trial. Participants who successfully completed the calibration procedure were then scheduled for the   f  MRI\u00a0experimental sessions. \n\n\n#### Experimental sessions \n  \nAll imaging data were acquired on a Siemens Tim Trio 3T MRI scanner in the Intermountain Neuroimaging Consortium facility at the University of Colorado Boulder. \n\nParticipants completed two separate counterbalanced scanning sessions, which were otherwise identical except that they were administered different types of stimulation for each session (i.e., somatic or vicarious pain). Each scanning session contained 11 runs and lasted about an hour. The experimental design was the same for both sessions, with the only difference being the duration of intra- and inter- stimulation jitter. Each stimulation was preceded by one of three levels of predictive cues that corresponded to three levels of stimulation, with the cues and stimulation completely crossed with each other (i.e., a 3 \u00d7 3 experimental design). These predictive cues were designed to be orthogonal to the intensity of stimulation, and were used to study cue-based expectation effects for aversive experiences (to be addressed in a separate manuscript). Prior to being scanned, participants completed a short training with an explicit learning task in which they learned the levels of the three cues that were to be later presented in the scanner ( ). The first two   f  MRI runs consisted of a conditioning task where the participants learned the association between the cues they encountered in the pre-scan training and the level of stimulation for that session. The remaining nine\u00a0  f  MRI runs consisted of the experimental task with the completely crossed cue-stimulation paradigm. Participants were unaware of the different\u00a0types of runs, and performed the same actions for all the runs. Only data from the nine experimental runs were used for further analyses. \n\nThe somatic pain sessions included 46, 47 and 48\u00b0C thermal stimulations and the vicarious pain sessions included previously published ( ) low, medium and high unpleasant images (which were independently normed through a survey with n = 20 participants). The somatic and vicarious pain sessions were conducted on different days to reduce learning effects. During both the conditioning (2 runs) and experimental runs (9 runs), participants received a cue-stimulus pair for each trial and were asked to make a rating on a visual analog scale (same as the calibration session) about the sensation they felt after each trial. For the somatic pain session, the participants rated the intensity of pain they felt during each trial. For the vicarious pain session, the participants were instructed to imagine that the injury occurring in the picture displayed was happening to them and rated how much pain they might feel in that situation. \n\nEach experimental run contained 9 trials (81 total for each session), which were counterbalanced between runs for each participant using a Latin Square design. Experimental trials (i.e., post conditioning) began with a 2s cue followed by a systematic jitter separating the cue from stimulation (i.e., 5, 7, 11s). Participants then received stimulation (somatic or vicarious pain) for 11s followed by a jittered fixation (2, 6 or 14s for somatic pain and 3, 6 or 12s for vicarious pain). The 11s trial duration for somatic pain included a 2s ramp-up, 2s ramp-down and 7s at target temperature; the vicarious pain stimuli remained on the screen for 11s. Finally, participants had 4s to make a rating of the sensation they experienced for the stimulation on a visual analog scale using a trackball (responses were confirmed with a button-click). There was an inter-trial jittered fixation (1, 4, or 10s for somatic pain and 1, 2 or 4s for vicarious pain). The jittered fixations were counterbalanced across trials within a run, so that all runs were of equal duration for each session. \n\n\n#### Behavioral analyses \n  \nParticipants rated the sensation they felt at every trial during the   f  MRI sessions. All ratings were averaged across trials and runs for each participant, separately for each level of stimulation\u2014low, medium and high, and for each body site (i.e., upper limb or UL and lower limb or LL). Averaged ratings for all participants from the somatic\u00a0pain and vicarious pain sessions were tested for differences in stimulation level, and body site separately. All behavioral data were analyzed using the R Project for Statistical Computing ( ). \n\n\n#### Image acquisition \n  \nStructural images were acquired using high-resolution T1 spoiled gradient recall images (SPGR) for anatomical localization and warped to Montr\u00e9al Neurological Institute (MNI) space ( ). Functional images were acquired with an echo-planar imaging sequence (TR = 1300 ms, TE = 25 ms, field of view = 220\u2009mm, 64x64 matrix, 3.4 x 3.4 x 3.4 mm  voxels, 26 interleaved slices with ascending acquisition, parallel imaging with an iPAT acceleration of 2). The somatic pain sessions had 11 runs, which each lasted 5 min and 50s (265 TRs), and the vicarious pain sessions had 11 runs, which each lasted 5 min and 22s (244 TRs). Stimulus presentation and behavioral data acquisition were controlled using Matlab software (MATLAB, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States). \n\n\n#### Image preprocessing \n  \nAll images were preprocessed using SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK). Mean structural T1-weighted images were computed for each participant from all imaging sessions. The mean structural images were then co-registered to the first functional image for each participant with an iterative procedure of automated registration using mutual information from the co-registration in SPM8 and manual adjustment of the automated algorithm\u2019s starting point until the automated procedure provided satisfactory alignment, and were normalized to MNI space using SPM8, interpolated to 2\u00d72\u00d72 mm  voxels. \n\nFunctional images were corrected for slice-acquisition-timing and motion using SPM8. They were then warped to SPM8\u2019s normative atlas using warping parameters estimated from co-registered, high resolution structural images, interpolated to 2\u00d72\u00d72 mm  voxels, and smoothed with a 8\u2009mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. Spatial smoothing was performed for between-participant analyses as it\u00a0does not diminish the sensitivity of multivariate analyses ( ), and also\u00a0captures mesoscopic patterns that are consistent across participants. No spatial smoothing was performed for any of the within-participant analyses. \n\nPrior to preprocessing of functional images, global outlier time points (i.e., 'spikes' in signal) were identified by computing both the mean and the standard deviation (across voxels) of values for each image for all slices. Mahalanobis distances for the matrix of slice-wise mean and standard deviation values (concatenated) were computed for all functional volumes (time), and any values with a significant   \u03c7   value (corrected for multiple comparisons) were considered outliers (less than 1% of images were outliers). The output of this procedure was later used as a covariate of noninterest in the first level models. \n\n\n#### Imaging analyses \n  \nFirst-level general linear model (GLM) analyses were conducted in SPM8. The first 6 volumes of each run were discarded, and the nine experimental runs were concatenated for each participant (the first two conditioning runs were excluded). Boxcar regressors, convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function, were constructed to model periods for the 2s cue presentation, the 5, 7, or 11s variable pre-stimulus fixation period, the 11s somatic stimulation (9 levels), and 4s rating periods. The fixation cross epoch was used as an implicit baseline. A high-pass filter of 224s was used for the somatic pain session and 309s was used for the vicarious pain sessions. These values for the high pass filter were determined based on a first-level analysis on the two conditioning runs, where the variance inflation factor was determined to be less than 5%. Contrasts of interest included the low, medium and high stimulation period collapsed across cues and body site (i.e., upper limb and lower limb), upper limb and lower limb contrasts for three levels of stimulation, and overall averaged stimulation collapsed across levels, cues and body site. These contrasts were computed for both the somatic pain and vicarious pain sessions, and were used for the signature response analyses described below. \n\n\n#### Univariate general linear model (GLM) analyses \n  \nA second level one-sample   t  -test was calculated for each contrast using robust regression. Specifically, we conducted group-level analyses for somatic pain collapsed across cue, stimulation level and body site against baseline (corrected at FDR q<0.01). We performed an identical group-analysis for vicarious pain against baseline (corrected at FDR q<0.01). We then used these results to identify commonly activated regions (by masking the overlapping significant voxels) for both somatic and vicarious pain. \n\n\n#### Neurologic pain signature (NPS) response analyses \n  \nThe contrast images from the first-level analyses for each participant were used as the input for the signature response analyses. The weight map from the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS) pattern ( ) was applied to the contrast images, and a single signature response value was computed for each participant, based on the dot product of the pattern of NPS weights with the contrast image for the participant. These signature response values were then tested for differences between levels of stimulation, body site, and pain modality (i.e., somatic pain or vicarious pain). \n\n\n#### Vicarious pain pattern (VPS) classification \n  \nData from the vicarious pain session for the 30 participants were used to train a LASSO-PCR\u00a0classifier to predict behavioral responses to different intensities of vicarious pain stimulation, with a leave-one-participant-out cross-validation scheme ( ). The scheme trains the classifier on   N   \u2212 1 participants and generates a weight map that best predicts the behavioral responses, and tests the classification on the left-out (  N  ) participant in order to obtain the cross-validated signature response\u00a0value for that participant. This process is continued until all participants have been left out of the classification algorithm once to obtain their respective cross-validated signature response values. To display the brain regions that significantly contributed to the prediction,\u00a0the pattern map was thresholded using a bootstrap procedure with 5000 samples and FDR correction of q<0.05. \n\n\n#### Vicarious pain signature response analyses \n  \nThe contrast images from the first-level analyses for each participant were used to compute signature responses for the vicarious pain pattern. The weight map from the VPS was applied to the contrast images and a single signature response value was computed for each participant, based on the dot product of the pattern of VPS weights with the contrast image for the participant. These signature response values were then tested for differences between levels of stimulation, body site, and pain\u00a0modality (i.e., somatic pain or vicarious pain). \n\n\n#### Between-participant local pattern classification \n  \nThe univariate GLM analyses identified commonly activated regions for both somatic and vicarious pain, namely anterior insula [aINS] and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [dACC] ( ). These regions were identified\u00a0by masking the overlapping significant voxels, and were used as regions of interest for separate region-specific local pattern classification. The LASSO-PCR classifier was trained\u00a0within each of these regions for somatic and vicarious pain. Cross-validated pattern responses within-modality, and cross-predicted pattern responses across modality were then computed for each participant. \n\n\n#### Within-participant local searchlight pattern classification \n  \nIn order to identify additional regions that might share representations across somatic and vicarious pain, a within-participant local pattern-based searchlight classification analysis was performed\u00a0on the unsmoothed single trial data using 8\u2009mm spherical searchlights around center voxels ( ). A local region classifier (i.e., LASSO-PCR) was trained to predict behavioral ratings from each modality separately for each of the 181,129 local regions, and the pattern obtained was used to cross-validate (within-modality) and cross-predict (between-modality) for each pain modality (i.e., somatic vs. vicarious). For each of the cross-validation folds, one run with upper limb stimulation and one run with lower limb stimulation was excluded from the analysis. The resulting pattern was tested on these left-out runs (cross-validation), and the corresponding trial numbers from the other modality (cross-prediction). The within-modality patterns loosely corroborate the global patterns, but are noisier and have considerably less statistical power. \n\n\n#### Stimulus and anticipation-related activity of NPS and VPS responses \n  \nIn order to potentially identify activation at time points that do not match the rise of pain experience (including anticipation), a smoothed finite-impulse response model (sFIR) was estimated\u00a0across all trials for both somatic and vicarious pain ( ). These models provide an empirical picture of the time-courses for the different events in a trial ( ). The first-level betas for each TR were estimated separately at the 11s stimulation onset, and at the 2s cue onset, for a total period of 32.5s after onset (which was equivalent to 25 TRs). Then,\u00a0the NPS and VPS patterns were applied\u00a0to the image obtained at each time point, and the signature responses were plotted\u00a0for each of the three levels of stimulation. \n\n\n#### Relationship between the VPS and other types of affective patterns \n  \nThe relationship between the VPS and patterns identified for\u00a0(a) romantic rejection ( ) and (b) negative emotion induced by affective pictures ( ), two other types of aversive experience, was tested by computing whole-brain spatial correlations between the patterns of the signatures. \n\n\n#### Upper limb versus lower limb pattern classification \n  \nTo determine whether a shared somatotopic representation exists for somatic and vicarious pain, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained\u00a0to differentiate between upper limb and lower limb sites separately for somatic and vicarious pain. The weights obtained following\u00a0classification of\u00a0upper limb from lower limb in one modality (e.g., somatic pain) were tested to\u00a0differentiate between the same body sites in the other modality (e.g., vicarious pain). \n\n\n\n### Study 2 \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nTwenty-eight right-handed female healthy participants ranging from 35 to 55 years (Mean Age = 44.32 years, SD = 4.58 years; Mean Education Level = 14.75 years, SD = 4.78 years) were recruited for Study 2 (data from 1 participant was discarded, see below). A complete medical interview was carried out to exclude participants with relevant medical or neurological disorders, history of substance abuse, psychiatric illness or chronic pain complaints. All participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the research and ethics committee of the Autonomous University of Barcelona. \n\n\n#### Mechanical pain stimulation \n  \nMechanical (pressure) stimulation was delivered using a hydraulic device capable of transmitting controlled pressure to a 1\u00a0cm  surface placed on the participants\u2019 right thumbnail. Similar to other studies ( ;  ;  ), this system consisted of a semi-hard rubber probe attached to a hydraulic piston that was displaced by mechanical pressure. In a calibration session, each participant was trained to report pain intensity and unpleasantness to different pressure stimuli ranging from 2 to 9\u2009kg/cm  (or up to tolerance threshold) using a numerical rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (not at all painful/unpleasant) to 100 (worst pain imaginable/most unpleasant imaginable). \n\nParticipants were exposed to two pressure stimulation intensities: (a) low pressure intensity (4.5\u2009kg/cm  for 10s) and (b) high pressure intensity, which was individually adjusted to provoke severe (above 60 in the NRS), but tolerable, pain for each participant (average 5.9 \u00b1 0.48\u2009kg for 10s). In a preliminary session before the   f  MRI experiment, each participant was familiarized with the two stimulation intensities. \n\nAll participants rated perceived pain intensity of the stimuli (low and high) that was later applied during the   f  MRI experiment\u00a0using a numerical rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (the worst pain possible). The 'low' stimulus intensity (4.5\u2009kg/cm ) was capable of producing low-to-moderate pain for all participants during the pre-scan assessment (mean \u00b1 SD in the NRS = 36.85 \u00b1 20.38 points), whereas the 'high' stimulus intensity was capable of producing severe but tolerable pain during the pre-scan assessment (mean \u00b1 SD in the NRS = 63.50 \u00b1 17.73 points). \n\n\n#### Experimental sessions \n  \nAll participants were first exposed to the low stimulus intensity task, which was followed by the high stimulus intensity task, occurring approximately 10 min later. A block design   f  MRI paradigm was used consisting of three events per stimulation cycle repeated 5 times: a rest event with pseudorandom variable duration (duration range: 20 to 32s), a 6s anticipatory event starting with a brief auditory stimulus (600ms tone) that cued the subsequent pain condition, and the actual pain event involving the application of the pressure stimulus (either low or high pressure) for 10s. Each participant was asked to rate pain intensity and unpleasantness immediately after the end of the trial\u00a0using the NRS described earlier. \n\n\n#### Image acquisition \n  \nParticipants were scanned\u00a0on a Philips Achieva 3.0 TX system (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands), with an eight-channel phased-array head coil and single-shot echoplanar imaging (EPI). Functional sequences consisted of gradient recalled acquisition in the steady state (TR = 2000 ms; TE = 35 ms; flip angle= 90\u00ba; dummy volumes = 4) within a field of view of 23 cm, a 96\u00d769 matrix, and slice thickness of 4mm (inter-slice gap, 1\u00a0mm). Twenty-two slices parallel to the anterior-posterior commissure covered the whole-brain. \n\n\n#### Image preprocessing \n  \nImaging data were processed using MATLAB version 2011b (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, Mass) and Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK). Preprocessing involved motion correction, spatial normalization and smoothing using a Gaussian filter (full-width at half-maximum, 8\u00a0mm). Data were normalized to the standard SPM-EPI template and resliced to 2\u00a0mm isotropic resolution in MNI space. From the original sample of 29 participants, data from 1 participant was excluded\u00a0due to poor signal in the frontal lobe and excessive head movement (z-axis translation > 2.0\u2009mm). Translation and rotation estimates (  x, y, z  ) were less than 2\u00a0mm or 2\u00b0, respectively, for all the included participants. \n\n\n#### Imaging analyses \n  \nThe GLM as implemented in SPM8 was used\u00a0to estimate brain responses to pain for each participant. Separate regressors for the anticipatory and the pain periods were used, considering a hemodynamic delay of 4s. In two previous studies using similar procedures ( ;  ), the duration of brain responses to 10s pressure stimuli of similar intensity was systematially oberved to\u00a0extend to 16 s (average response duration across pain processing regions), which was consistent with previous studies ( ;  ). Pain-related activation was modeled using a pain condition of 16s duration. Autocorrelation was not modeled\u00a0to avoid dramatic decreases in efficiency when autocorrelation is misestimated. Pressure stimulation \u2013 baseline contrast images were calculated for each participant. \n\n\n#### Signature response analysis \n  \nThe contrast images from the first-level analyses for each participant were used as the input for the signature response analyses. The weight map from the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS) pattern ( ) was applied to the contrast images and a single signature response value was computed for each contrast image for each participant, based on the dot product of the pattern of NPS weights with the contrast image for the participant. These signature response values were then tested for differences between levels of stimulation. \n\n\n\n### Study 3 \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nEighteen healthy participants were recruited\u00a0through the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). Participants were excluded based on medical illness or history in first-degree relatives of developmental disorders, learning disabilities, autism, affective disorders, and anxiety disorders. Participants with a history of substance or alcohol dependency or abuse within one year prior to participation were excluded as well. There were a total of 14 right-handed and 1 left-handed male participants (measured by the Edinburgh Inventory Handedness Questionnaire ( ). All participants provided written informed consent, approved by the ISMMS Institutional Review Board. \n\n\n#### Experimental sessions \n  \n##### Anticipatory stimulation paradigm (electrical or\u00a0shock pain) \n  \nElectrodermal stimulations (shock) were placed to the left extremity, with two MRI compatible EL508 disposable electrodes pre-gelled with a 1-cm diameter circular contact area. This paradigm used uncomfortable electrodermal stimulation (low current) ( ) applied to the left extremity (lower medial side above the ankle). This is an S1-S2 paradigm with 1s of S1 for safe/stimulation cue and 1s of S2 with/without stimulation, with an inter stimulus interval (ISI) of 3s. The inter trial interval (ITI) was jittered (4\u201312s, exponentially distributed, mean = 5s). Mean duration for each trial was 10s. Different colored squares, identical in shape, size, and luminance, served as the cue and target stimuli. Participants were instructed to view visual stimulus squares (red, blue, yellow, or green) presented pseudo-randomly. Participants were informed that a red square with the word 'STIMULATION', when presented, indicates that stimulation may follow when a yellow square appears. They were also informed that a blue square with the word 'SAFE' indicates that there was no stimulation when a yellow square appears. Each run had 48 counterbalanced trials with 24 safe trials and 24 stimulation trials. Electrodermal stimulation was given during 50% of the S2 period of the stimulation trials (12 of 24 trials) when the 'STIMULATION' stimulus preceded the yellow square. In addition, there were 4 catch trials with the word 'PRESS' to instruct the participant to press a button to ensure that participants were watching the screen. There was a 30s resting period at the beginning and end of each run. Each run took 580s or\u00a0about 10 min. Two runs of the shock pain paradigm were conducted. Due to the fact that the threshold for pain perception varies markedly among individuals, the intensity was decided and recorded individually before scanning at a medium level of pain tolerable by the participant (using a 5-point scale). No active task was required for shock or safe trials. However, participants were instructed\u00a0to press a button when they saw the target following the 'PRESS' cue in order to maintain their attention during scanning. Pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings by each participant were also collected at the end of each run with a 5-point scale using a glove response device. \n\n\n##### Empathy for others\u2019 pain (observed pain) \n  \nParticipants were presented with 256 photographs (in color) of hands or feet of individuals in painful or non-painful situations, and were asked to judge whether the person shown in the image was suffering from pain or not ( ;  ). Stimuli were jittered and presented in an event-related   f  MRI design such that presentation of each type of picture was counterbalanced and pseudo-randomized, with each trial having all events proceeded and followed equally. Each 5.5s trial consisted of a presentation of a stimulus picture, along with the two response categories (i.e., no pain and pain) for 2.5s, during which participants made their responses. This was followed by 3s of fixation. Sixty-four images were selected for presentation in each run, for a total of four runs. The order of trials in each block/run was randomized with optimized efficiency. There was a 30s fixation period at the beginning and end of each run to allow the skin conductance and hemodynamic responses to return to baseline. \n\n\n\n#### Image acquisition \n  \nAll MRI acquisitions were obtained on a 3 Tesla Siemens Allegra MRI system at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. All participants underwent only one session with all scanning sequences. The whole scan session lasted about one and a half hours. Foam padding was used to keep participants\u2019 heads still. All images were acquired along axial planes parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line. The order and scan sequences were as follows: (1) A low resolution sagittal high speed scout image; (2) A high-resolution T2-weighted anatomical volume of the whole brain, acquired on an axial plane parallel to the AC-PC line with a turbo spin-echo (TSE) pulse sequence with the following parameters: 40 axial slices of 4\u2009mm thick, skip=0\u2009mm, TR = 4050 ms, TE = 99 ms, flip angle=170\u00b0, field of view (FOV)=240\u2009mm, matrix size=448\u00d7512, voxel size=0.47\u00d70.47\u00d74 mm ; (3) T2*-weighted images. Slices were obtained corresponding to the T2-weighted images. The   f  MRI imaging was performed using a gradient echoplanar imaging (GE-EPI) sequence: 40 axial slices, 4\u00a0mm thick, and skip=0\u00a0mm, TR = 2500\u00a0ms, TE = 27\u00a0ms, Flip angle = 82\u00b0, FOV=240\u00a0mm, and matrix size=64\u00d764. Each run started with 2 dummy volumes before the onset of the task to allow for equilibration of T1 saturation effects. Stimulation events were modeled as single trials. The order of trials in each block/run was randomized with optimized efficiency. A total of two EPI runs with 232 image volumes per run for the shock paradigm and a total of four EPI runs with 165 image volumes per run for the observed pain paradigm were acquired for each participant. \n\n\n#### Image preprocessing \n  \nThe functional scans were adjusted for slice timing, realigned to the first volume, coregistered to the T2 image, normalized to a standard MNI template, and spatially smoothed with an 8\u2009mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. \n\n\n#### Imaging analyses \n  \nEvent-related analyses of the fMRI data from the two tasks were conducted using SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK). GLM ( ) for the functional scans from each participant was performed\u00a0by modeling the observed event-related activation ( ) and regressors that\u00a0identified the relationship between task events and the hemodynamic response. Regressors were created by convolving a train of delta functions representing the sequence of individual events with the default SPM basis function, which consists of a synthetic hemodynamic response function composed of two gamma functions ( ). For shock pain, there were six regressors (all cues, stimulation cues, all targets, targets with stimulation cues, stimulation, and catch trials); for observed pain, there were two regressors (painful, non-painful). Six parameters generated during motion correction were entered as covariates. Shock pain \u2013 baseline, and observed pain \u2013 baseline contrast images were calculated for each participant. \n\n\n#### Signature response analysis \n  \nThe contrast images from the first-level analyses for each participant for both shock and observed pain conditions were used to compute signature responses. The weight map from the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS) pattern ( ), and the Vicarious Pain Signature (VPS) were applied separately to the contrast images and signature response values were computed for each contrast image for each participant. These signature response values were then tested for differences between types of stimulation, for both the NPS and VPS. \n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4907690, "text_md5": "b07f0a8c7cecdd9e4b0af569f85b641b", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 177], "journal": [178, 183], "publication_year": [185, 189], "title": [200, 285], "keywords": [299, 345], "abstract": [358, 3331], "body": [3340, 82282]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 27296895, "doi": "10.7554/eLife.15166", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4907690", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4907690"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4907690\">4907690</a>", "list_title": "PMC4907690  Somatic and vicarious pain are represented by dissociable multivariate brain patterns"}
