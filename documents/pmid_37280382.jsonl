This review aimed to determine the role of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in detecting brain functional changes. A\u00a0systematic search was performed in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS) databases in June 2022. Patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy and periodic rs-fMRI assessments were included. A\u00a0meta-analysis was performed to determine the potential of rs-fMRI for detecting brain changes. Ten studies with a\u00a0total of 513\u00a0subjects (head and neck cancer patients, n\u202f=\u2009437; healthy controls, n\u202f=\u200976) were included. A\u00a0significance of rs-fMRI for detecting brain changes in the temporal and frontal lobes, cingulate cortex, and cuneus was demonstrated in most studies. These changes were reported to be associated with dose (6/10\u00a0studies) and latency (4/10\u00a0studies). A\u00a0strong effect size (r\u202f=\u20090.71, p\u202f<\u20090.001) between rs-fMRI and brain changes was also reported, suggesting rs-fMRI's capability for monitoring brain alterations. Resting-state functional MRI is a\u00a0promising tool for detecting brain functional changes following head and neck radiotherapy. These changes are correlated with latency and prescription dose.
