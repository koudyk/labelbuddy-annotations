We conducted a systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis on structural or functional connectome MRI studies comparing global graph theoretical characteristics between schizophrenia and healthy controls. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to examine confounding effects. Based on the included 48 studies, structural connectome in schizophrenia showed a significant decrease in segregation (lower clustering coefficient and local efficiency, Hedge's g= -0.352 and -0.864, respectively) and integration (higher characteristic path length and lower global efficiency, Hedge's g= 0.532 and -0.577 respectively). The functional connectome showed no difference between groups except \u03b3. Moderator analysis indicated that clinical and methodological factors exerted a potential effect on the graph theoretical characteristics. Our analysis revealed a weaker small-worldization trend in structural connectome of schizophrenia. For the relatively unchanged functional connectome, more homogenous and high-quality studies are warranted to elucidate whether the change was blurred by heterogeneity or the presentation of pathophysiological reconfiguration.
