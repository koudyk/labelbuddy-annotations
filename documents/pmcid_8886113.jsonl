Most patients carry mutations in the X-linked   MECP2   gene, coding for the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), originally isolated as an epigenetic transcriptional factor able to bind methylated DNA and repress transcription. Recent data implicated a role for glia in RTT, showing that astrocytes express   Mecp2   and that its deficiency affects their ability to support neuronal maturation by non-cell autonomous mechanisms. To date, some molecular, structural and functional alterations have been attributed to   Mecp2   null astrocytes, but how they evolve over time and whether they follow a spatial heterogeneity are two aspects which deserve further investigations. In this study, we assessed cytoskeletal features of astrocytes in   Mecp2   deficient brains by analyzing their arbor complexity and processes in reconstructed GFAP  cells at different ages, corresponding to peculiar stages of the disorder, and in different cerebral regions (motor and somatosensory cortices and CA1 layer of hippocampus). Our findings demonstrate the presence of defects in   Mecp2   null astrocytes that worsen along disease progression and strictly depend on the brain area, highlighting motor and somatosensory cortices as the most affected regions. Of relevance, astrocyte cytoskeleton is impaired also in the somatosensory cortex of symptomatic heterozygous animals, with   Mecp2   astrocytes showing slightly more pronounced defects with respect to the   Mecp2   null cells, emphasizing the importance of non-cell autonomous effects. We reported a temporal correlation between the progressive thinning of layer I and the atrophy of astrocytes, suggesting that their cytoskeletal dysfunctions might contribute to cortical defects. Considering the reciprocal link between morphology and function in astrocytes, we analyzed the effect of   Mecp2   deficiency on the expression of selected astrocyte-enriched genes, which describe typical astrocytic features. qRT-PCR data corroborated our results, reporting an overall decrement of gene expression, which is area and age-dependent. In conclusion, our data show that   Mecp2   deficiency causes structural and molecular alterations in astrocytes, which progress along with the severity of symptoms and diversely occur in the different cerebral regions, highlighting the importance of considering heterogeneity when studying astrocytes in RTT. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMethyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), encoded by the X-linked   MECP2   gene, is an epigenetic regulator, named for its ability to bind methylated cytosines ( ). It was initially described as a transcriptional repressor, diversely modulating gene expression depending on the cellular subtype and cerebral region, but it is now recognized that MeCP2 exerts multiple genome-wide regulatory activities ( ;  ;  ). It can function as an organizer of chromatin architecture, a transcriptional activator, a regulator of mRNA splicing and miRNA processing, and we recently reported its role for proper primary cilium formation and functioning ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). MeCP2 is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, but appears to be most abundant in brain, where its expression begins prenatally and progressively increases peaking during synaptic development and plasticity ( ). MeCP2 plays a critical role at different developmental stages and its importance for neuronal maturation and maintenance, circuit network and plasticity has been extensively described ( ;  ;  ). Further, conditional animal models have been engineered to selectively silence   Mecp2   in different brain areas or neuronal subtypes. Studies using these mice reported that each mouse model develops a subset of RTT-like symptoms and provided useful information about the Mecp2 roles in different brain districts ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Although the full spectrum of MeCP2 functions remains to be elucidated, its importance for proper CNS functioning is highlighted by the existence of neurological disorders associated with   MECP2   mutations, among which Rett syndrome (RTT; OMIM 312750) is the most studied ( ). RTT affects approximately 1 in 10,000 females worldwide, representing the most frequent cause of severe intellectual disability in girls and no cure is currently available. After an apparently normal development until 6\u201318 months of age, girls fail to reach developmental milestones and experience a rapid regression resulting in loss of acquired skills, profound intellectual disability, stereotypical movements, autistic features. Sensory and motor deficits are considered among the most debilitating symptoms in RTT patients, together with breathing alterations and seizures ( ;  ).   Mecp2   deficient mice recapitulate several clinical signs of RTT, exhibiting progressive defects in cognition and motor abilities, anxiety, breathing alterations and premature death ( ;  ). Although male hemizygous animals are widely used in basic research and pre-clinical studies due to their penetrant phenotype, it is strongly encouraged the investigations also in female heterozygous mice, which more closely resemble the human condition ( ). \n\nAmong the neuropathological alterations reported both in RTT patient biopsies and in animal models, morphological studies revealed a reduction in brain volume and weight, mostly pronounced in the prefrontal, frontal and anterior temporal regions, with a preservation of cerebellum and occipital regions ( ). In accordance with the higher expression of   Mecp2   in neuronal cells, the majority of defects accounts for morphological and functional impairments in neurons. Indeed, null neurons exhibit a reduction in soma size, dendritic arborization, spine density, and these changes appear area-specific, since they are mainly present in the frontal and temporal regions, including the motor, somatosensory cortex and hippocampal CA1 neurons ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Besides morphological alterations,   Mecp2   deficiency affects brain activity, disrupting the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition with a pattern that varies among different brain regions ( ;  ). However,   Mecp2   expression has been detected also in glial cells and, although in astrocytes its levels are five-fold lower than in neurons ( ;  ;  ;  ),   in vitro   and   in vivo   studies reported that   Mecp2   deficiency in astrocytes contributes to the neuropathological manifestations of RTT. In fact,   Mecp2   null cortical astrocytes cause abnormal dendritic arborization in wild-type (WT) neurons and, similarly, mutant astrocytes differentiated from isogenic induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) from RTT patients adversely affect neuronal morphology ( ;  ). Of relevance, evidence from conditional animal models highlights a role not only for neurons ( ) but also for astrocytes ( ;  ) in RTT pathophysiology. Indeed, the conditional reactivation of   Mecp2   only in astrocytes in an otherwise null animal ameliorates dendritic complexity, neuronal soma size and levels of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and, at behavioral level, it leads to an improvement of locomotor and respiratory defects, prolonging lifespan ( ). Complementary, TAM-induced   Mecp2   conditional depletion in astrocytes mainly causes breathing alterations ( ;  ). \n\nAstrocytes are highly complex glial cells, which serve a multitude of roles spanning from supplying trophic and metabolic support to neurons, regulating neurotransmitter release, contributing to neuronal network activity and maintaining the integrity of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) ( ;  ;  ). Through the production of several bioactive molecules, astrocytes control different steps in brain development, including neuronal migration, synapse formation and elimination. Recent evidence highlighted astrocytes as heterogeneous cells within and among cerebral regions in terms of molecular, functional and morphological features ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, to the best of our knowledge, no RTT study did consider astrocyte heterogeneity. Further, only few reports analyzed which molecular mechanisms are compromised in   Mecp2   deficient astrocytes. In particular, a microarray study performed on cultured   Mecp2   null primary cortical astrocytes revealed 118 differentially regulated genes that might contribute to abnormal astrocyte signaling and neuronal support functions ( ). Similarly, microarray expression data of   Mecp2   cultured cortical astrocytes reported the alteration of 257 genes, generally involved in major cellular functions, including cell-cell communication and cellular development ( ). Curiously, transcriptional studies from Yasui\u2019s and Del\u00e9pine\u2019s laboratories displayed very limited overlap, probably due to the use of different mouse models, different number of astrocyte passages   in vitro  , and/or to the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in astrocyte cultures, with inter-vendor and inter-batch inconsistencies contributing to the variability. Further, a very recent proteomic analysis on the secretome derived from   Mecp2   knock-out (KO) cortical astrocytes revealed several deregulated proteins, suggesting the importance of non-cell autonomous mechanisms for neuronal maturation ( ). Comparing data from the above-mentioned -omic studies, lipocalin 2 emerged as an interesting candidate and its addition to   Mecp2   null neurons rescued morphological defects ( ;  ;  ).   In vivo  , a multi-omic study combining RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses of the adult   Mecp2   null cortex (P60) reported the alteration of 46 astrocyte-specific genes associated with astrocyte maturation and morphology, together with decreased levels of astrocytic proteins involved in apoptosis ( ). Although these data highlight the dysregulation in RTT of relevant astrocytic genes, it is not known when these defects appear, if they homogenously occur in brain regardless of the cerebral region and if they are accompanied by morphological defects. \n\nIt has been suggested that astrocyte morphology might redirect their role and function, and changes in astrocyte structure, such a withdrawal or outgrowth of astrocyte processes, can modify their ability to interact with neurons ( ;  ). Loss of astrocyte complexity is a common pathological feature in many neurological disorders ( ) and, in the field of RTT research, fewer and poorly branched astrocytic ramifications have been described in the dentate gyrus and corpus callosum of   Mecp2   mouse models as well as in the hippocampus of a conditional mouse, in which   Mecp2   has been postnatally inactivated ( ;  ). Further, cultured astrocytes derived from both   Mecp2   KO and   Mecp2   mouse brain and human RTT iPSCs displayed altered microtubule dynamics, which might influence the correct remodeling of the cytoskeleton and cellular shape ( ;  ). \n\nIn this study, we analyzed the complexity of GFAP-stained astrocytes in three cerebral regions known to be affected in RTT ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), i.e., the dorsal hippocampus and the somatosensory and motor cortices of WT,   Mecp2   null and heterozygous animals, using an optimized   Simple Neurite Tracer   Plugin by ImageJ ( ). Our results showed that   Mecp2   deficiency impairs astrocyte complexity along disease progression and that the effects vary depending on the specific cerebral region, particularly impinging on the motor and somatosensory cortex. Molecular studies reported an overall deregulation of astrocyte-enriched genes involved in several biological functions, which largely parallel the onset of cytoskeletal defects. Of relevance, analysis on the   Mecp2   heterozygous cortex highlighted the occurrence of non-cell autonomous effects as astrocytes expressing the WT allele exhibited comparable or more marked alterations than those expressing the mutant one. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Animals \n  \nThe   Mecp2  .  mouse strain was originally purchased from the Jackson Laboratories, then backcrossed and maintained on a clean CD1 background ( ). These mice recapitulate the typical phenotype of C57BL/6 mice, with the advantage of having a larger progeny and minor risk of litter cannibalization.   Mecp2   null mouse genotype was determined by PCR on genomic DNA purified from ears using the following primers: 5\u2032-ACCTAGCCTGCCTGTACTTT-3\u2032, forward primer for the null allele; 5\u2032-GACTGAAGTTACAGATGGTTGTG-3\u2032, forward primer for the wild type allele; 5\u2032-CCACCCTCCAGTTTGGTTTA-3\u2032, common reverse primer. \n\n Mecp2   null mice at post-natal days (P) 20, 40, and 70, heterozygous female mice at P90 and P180, and the corresponding gender-matched WT littermates were used for immunofluorescence and molecular analyses ( ). Animals of each experimental group derived from at least three different litters and were sacrificed by rapid decapitation or by transcardial perfusion depending on experimental needs. Mice were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment in a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with food and water   ad libitum  . All procedures were performed in accordance with the European Union Communities Council Directive (2010/63/EU) and Italian laws (D.L.26/2014). Protocols were approved by the Italian Minister for Scientific Research and by the San Raffaele Scientific Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the Italian law. \n  \nAnimals used in the study. \n  \n\n### Immunofluorescence on Brain Sections \n  \nMice were anaesthetized by using Tribromoethanol (250 mg/Kg) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were post-fixed 90 min in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C and dehydrated in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4\u00b0C (\u223c 48 h). Brains were frozen in isopentane at \u221230\u00b0C for 3 min and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Each brain was embedded by PolyFreeze Tissue Freezing Medium (P0091, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and sectioning was performed with a cryostat (CM1860, Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Immunofluorescence for GFAP was performed on coronal sections of 40 \u03bcm, which were collected in PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and stored at 4\u00b0C. At least three non-consecutive sections for each animal were selected for the analysis in each cerebral region. Representative images are reported in   for motor cortex,   and   for somatosensory cortex, and   for hippocampus and at least three animals per group were analyzed. Antigen retrieval was applied before immunostaining, then sections were permeabilized using 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min and blocked with 4% FBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Sections were incubated with the primary antibody for GFAP (1:3500; clone GA5, MAB3402, Merck) in blocking solution overnight at 4\u00b0C. For immunofluorescence on heterozygous brains, the primary antibody for Mecp2 (1:1000; clone D4F3, #3456, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, United States) was also included. Then, sections were washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor anti-mouse 488 and/or anti-rabbit 568 conjugated secondary antibody (1:500; A21202 and A11036, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) in blocking solution for 1 h in the dark. After several washes in blocking solution (at least five washes of 5 min), DNA was stained with DAPI solution (1:1000 in PBS; #62248, Thermo Fisher Scientific) following a 10-min incubation and sections were washed in PBS. Lastly, they were mounted on microscope slides with Fluoromount Aqueous Mounting Medium (F4680, Merck) and stored at 4\u00b0C until image acquisition. \n  \n Mecp2   KO astrocytes in the motor cortex (layer I) exhibit cytoskeletal atrophy in early-symptomatic (P20) as well as in moderate (P40) and severe symptomatic animals (P70).

One-way ANOVA indicates a significant increase in the total length and number of WT and KO astrocyte processes from P20 to P40 (  p   < 0.001).   (E\u2013G)   The graphs depict data from Sholl analysis, reporting the number of intersections of WT and KO astrocyte processes with concentric circles, at P20   (E)  , P40   (F)  , and P70   (G)  .

WT and   Mecp2   KO astrocytes (P20:   n   = 36 WT and   n   = 36 KO; P40:   n   = 16 WT and   n   = 35 KO; P70:   n   = 34 WT and   n   = 36 KO; n indicates the number of cells) derived from at least three different animals per genotype (P20:   N   = 4 WT and   N   = 4 KO; P40:   N   = 3 WT and   N   = 5 KO; P70:   N   = 4 WT and   N   = 4 KO; N indicates the number of animals). \n  \n\n### Microscope Acquisition and Imaging Analysis \n  \nFor the analysis of GFAP  astrocytes, Z-stack images (212.13 \u00d7 212.13 \u03bcm , 1,024 \u00d7 1,024 pixel resolution, 16-bit grayscale depth) of brain sections were acquired at a Nikon Ti2 Microscope equipped with an A1 + laser scanning confocal system and a Plan Apo \u03bb 60\u00d7 oil-immersion objective with a step size of 0.5 \u03bcm. Digital zoom 1\u00d7, offset background, pinhole size, scanning speed, scan direction and line average mode were maintained constant for each dataset acquisition ( ,  ). Reconstruction of the arbor of cortical and hippocampal astrocytes was performed using   Simple Neurite Tracer   (SNT), a plugin by Fiji software. Cell selection criteria required for morphometric analyses are described in  . All GFAP  processes of selected astrocytes were manually traced and binarized. Then, the total length of processes and their number were measured with SNT, while   Sholl analysis   plugin was run on the maximum intensity projections to investigate the complexity of astrocytic arbor ( ). Concentric circles spaced by 4 \u03bcm and centered on astrocytic nuclei were used. \n\nThe cortical thickness of somatosensory and motor cortices was measured in the same sections used for the analysis of GFAP  cells, with additional animals when required, taking the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas as reference. Images from DAPI stained sections were acquired at 4\u00d7 magnification with a Nikon Eclipse Ni-U epi-fluorescence microscope. Three lines perpendicular to the motor cortex border and five to the somatosensory cortex border were traced along layer I and whole layers and an average of measures was calculated. At least three non-consecutive sections per animal and three animals per group were analyzed and the values obtained were plotted on graph. Only slices between \u22121.34 mm and \u22121.82 mm from bregma were included in the analysis. All image analyses were performed by a researcher blind to the genotype. \n\n\n### RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real Time PCR \n  \nAnimals (  n   = 8 for each experimental group) were perfused with cold saline solution to remove blood from brain capillaries and brains were isolated and immersed in HBSS solution (H6648, Sigma, Burlington, MA, United States) containing 0.6% glucose. Using a vibratome (VT1000S, Leica Biosystems), 4/5 coronal slices (500 \u03bcm) starting from the frontal lobe were obtained from each brain. Slices were maintained in cold 0.6% glucose in HBSS. Under a stereomicroscope motor cortex, somatosensory cortex and dorsal hippocampus were dissected from brain sections accordingly to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas and immediately frozen on dry ice. In a pilot experiment (data not shown), in order to assess the accuracy in cortical dissection, we analyzed the mRNA levels for genes, which are selectively enriched in the motor (  Ube4b   and   Tnnc1  ) and in the somatosensory cortex (  Rorb   and   Tmem215  ) (Allen Mouse Brain Atlas). \n\nTotal RNA was extracted from all the cerebral regions using PureZOL (#7326890, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) and quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. After assessing RNA integrity by agarose electrophoresis, RNA was reversely transcribed using the RT  First Strand Kit (#330404, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as instructed by the manufacturer. The resulting cDNA was used as a template for qRT-PCR with SYBR Green Master Mix (#4472908, Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, United States) with designated primers ( ). Melting curve showed a single product peak, indicating good product specificity. The best housekeeping gene was selected for each comparison between   CypA and Rpl13  , and fold change in gene expression was calculated using the 2(-delta Ct) method. \n  \nThe genes and the primers used for qRT-PCR are reported. \n  \n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nAll data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Before any statistical analysis, normality distribution was evaluated for each dataset by D\u2019Agostino and Pearson test and outliers were assessed by ROUT test (  Q   = 1%) or Grubb\u2019s test (\u03b1 = 0.05%). Unpaired Student\u2019s   t  -tests or Mann\u2013Whitney tests were used for two group comparisons in accordance with data distribution. To assess the progressive increase in processes number and length of astrocytes and to analyze cortical thickness progression, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s   post hoc   test was applied. A Kruskal\u2013Wallis test followed by Dunn\u2019s   post hoc   test was used to compare astrocytic processes in female brains. Statistical significance for multiple group comparisons was determined by two-way ANOVA, followed by Sidak\u2019s   post hoc   test. All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, United States). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n###  Mecp2   KO Astrocytes Show a Reduction in Arbor Complexity, Which Depends on Brain Region and Stage of the Disease \n  \nTo assess whether the lack of   Mecp2   differently affects astrocyte cytoskeleton with respect to the specific brain region, brain sections from KO animals and WT littermates were stained with an anti-GFAP antibody and shape complexity, total length and number of processes were measured on reconstructed astrocytes ( ). Although other methods to resolve the complexity of astrocyte morphology exist, it is recognized that GFAP staining can faithfully be used to reveal the number of primary branches ( ,  ,   and  ) ( ). The analysis was performed on brain areas, whose functional alterations are well documented in RTT, i.e., motor and somatosensory cortices and the CA1 pyramidal layer of dorsal hippocampus ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Further, our results on pre-synaptic puncta volume demonstrated the presence of smaller spines in the selected cerebral regions of CD1   Mecp2   null animals, confirming previous data on BL6 mice ( ;  ). In the cortical areas the analysis focused on layer I, in line with previous evidence indicating that superficial cortical layers are more affected than deep layers in mutant mice ( ); in addition, GFAP  astrocytes within layer I are scattered and show no overlapping domain, thus facilitating cytoskeletal analysis. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, a characterization of layer I astrocytes was never reported in RTT and poorly provided in neurodevelopmental disorders in general, although it is recognized that these cortical astrocytes show peculiar gene expression and calcium dynamics ( ;  ). To describe cytoskeletal morphology of astrocytes along the disease progression, the analysis was performed at P20, corresponding to an early-symptomatic phase, P40 and P70, representing a moderate and late symptomatic phase, respectively. Analysis of KO astrocytes within the motor cortex revealed the presence of defects already at P20, when RTT behavioral symptoms are not overt, and the maintenance of these defects along the disease progression. Indeed, astroglial cells exhibited a reduction in total length and number of processes at all time points ( ) and accordingly Sholl analysis reported a significant decrease in shape complexity ( ). The same analysis was performed on   Mecp2   null astrocytes of the somatosensory cortex, showing similar defects to those described in the adjacent cortical area. Specifically, at P20, we reported a significant decrease in total length and number of processes of KO astrocytes ( ), although their shape complexity was quite comparable to the WT ( ). Interestingly, atrophy in KO cells progressed over time, leading to a significant impairment in arbor complexity both at P40 and at P70 ( ). Accordingly, at both ages, we found a reduction in total length of processes, together with defects in their number ( ). Similar alterations were also evident in layer II/III of the cortex of P40 null animals ( ), suggesting a widespread impact of   Mecp2   absence on morphological features of GFAP  astrocytes along different cortical layers. On the contrary, in the CA1 pyramidal layer of the hippocampus, cytoskeletal defects were present only at the latest time point (P70), when process ramifications were significantly decreased at 20, 24, and 32 \u03bcm from the soma ( ), together with a reduction in total length of branches ( ), with no effect on their number ( ). \n  \nHippocampal (CA1 pyramidal layer)   Mecp2   KO astrocytes manifest signs of cytoskeletal atrophy only in severe symptomatic animals (P70), but not at earlier time points.

(B)   Micrographs are representative images of WT and   Mecp2   KO astrocytes immunostained for GFAP (green) and DAPI (blue) in the CA1 pyramidal layer of the hippocampus at P70. Scale bar = 10 \u03bcm.   (C,D)   The graphs show the total length of processes   (C)   and their number   (D)   in   Mecp2   KO astrocytes, compared to WT astrocytes, in the CA1 of dorsal hippocampus of P20, P40, and P70 mice. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SEM. ***  p   < 0.001 by Student\u2019s   t  -test or Mann\u2013Whitney test in accordance with data distribution. One-way ANOVA indicates a progressive and significant increase in the total length of processes of WT astrocytes (from P20 to P40   p   < 0.001; from P40 to P70   p   < 0.01), and an arrest of growth at P40 in KO cells (from P20 to P40   p   < 0.001). The number of processes increases from P20 to P40 (  p   < 0.001) and slightly decreases at P70 in both WT (  p   = 0.061) and KO (  p   < 0.01) astrocytes.   (E\u2013G)   The graphs depict data from Sholl analysis, reporting the number of intersections of WT and   Mecp2   KO astrocyte processes with concentric circles, at P20   (E)  , P40   (F)  , and P70   (G)  . Representative images of reconstructed astrocyte arbors by SNT plugin are reported above each graph. *  p   < 0.05, ***  p   < 0.001 by two-way ANOVA, followed by Sidak\u2019s multiple comparison test. WT and   Mecp2   KO astrocytes (P20:   n   = 36 WT and   n   = 36 KO; P40:   n   = 27 WT and   n   = 45 KO; P70:   n   = 36 WT and   n   = 36 KO; n indicates the number of cells) derived from at least three different animals per genotype (P20:   N   = 4 WT and   N   = 4 KO; P40:   N   = 3 WT and   N   = 5 KO; P70:   N   = 4 WT and   N   = 4 KO; N indicates the number of animals). \n  \nFurther, it is relevant to note the progressive increase of total length and number of astrocyte processes from P20 to P40 in the WT somatosensory cortex, in good accordance with previous data on physiological astrocyte maturation ( ). Similarly, hippocampal WT astrocytes manifested a significant increase of total length of processes from P20 to P70, whereas KO cells arrested their growth at P40 ( ). \n\nInterestingly, by analyzing the immunostaining for Mecp2 specifically in GFAP  astrocytes, we observed that its protein levels are higher in layer I of both cortices compared with CA1 hippocampus and that in the somatosensory cortex they overcome those of the motor cortex. Conversely, in neurons Mecp2 is expressed at comparable levels among cortical and hippocampal regions and, accordingly to previous evidence ( ;  ), its expression is almost five-fold higher than that of astrocytes ( ). \n\nAll in all, our data demonstrate that   Mecp2   KO astrocytes exhibit   in vivo   atrophic signs, that depend on the cerebral region and the age analyzed; further, they suggest that Mecp2 abundance might at least in part contribute to the observed heterogeneity. \n\n\n### In the Heterozygous Brain Cortical Astrocytes Manifest Atrophic Features Regardless of   Mecp2   Expression \n  \nTo understand whether non-cell-autonomous mechanisms participate to the observed astrocytic defects, we proceeded analyzing the complexity of GFAP-stained astrocytes in the   Mecp2   heterozygous brains. In particular, we compared astrocytes expressing either the WT or   Mecp2   null allele. Considering the entity of defects in symptomatic null animals, the analysis was performed on layer I of the somatosensory cortex including in the study animals at P90 and P180. Since symptoms in heterozygous animals develop later ( ;  ;  ), we selected these ages as those corresponding to early and moderate symptomatic phases, respectively. WT astrocytes derived from healthy animals of the same litter were used as control. \n\nAnalysis at early time point (P90) indicated no alteration in GFAP  processes ( ). Interestingly, at P180, both Mecp2    and Mecp2    astrocytes showed a reduced complexity compared to WT ( ). Intriguingly, Sholl analysis and the measurement of the total length revealed that in the heterozygous brain, astrocytes expressing the WT allele are characterized by a slightly worse phenotype than cells devoid of Mecp2 ( ). Thus, besides confirming the occurrence of astrocyte defects in the heterozygous brain, these data point to the involvement of non-cell autonomous mechanisms in the occurrence of astrocyte cytoskeletal alterations. \n  \nIn the layer I of the somatosensory cortex of symptomatic heterozygous animals, the astrocyte cytoskeleton is affected regardless of   Mecp2   expression.   (A)   Micrographs are representative images of astrocytes in the somatosensory cortex (layer I) of WT and heterozygous brains at P180. WT astrocytes were immunostained for GFAP (green) and DAPI (blue); heterozygous brains were also immunostained for Mecp2 (red) to discriminate between cells expressing the WT (  Mecp2  ) or null (  Mecp2  ) allele. Scale bar = 10 \u03bcm.   (B,C)   The graphs show the total length   (B)   and the number of processes   (C)   in Mecp2  (gray) and Mecp2  (red) astrocytes derived from the somatosensory cortex (layer I) of P90 and P180 heterozygous female mice, compared to astrocytes of WT animals (black).

Four animals per genotype were used at each time point (  N   = 4). Astrocytes were randomly selected in the acquired field (P90\u2013110:   n   = 44 WT,   n   = 46 Mecp2 ,   n   = 18 Mecp2 ; P180:   n   = 49 WT,   n   = 35 Mecp2  and   n   = 21 Mecp2 ; n indicates the number of cells). \n  \n\n### Defects in the Main Processes of   Mecp2   KO Astrocytes Are Accompanied by Reduced Cortical Thickness \n  \nMicrocephaly is one of the RTT hallmarks and a progressive reduction of the thickness of the motor and somatosensory cortices has been reported in the   Mecp2   null model in C57BL/6 background, compared to age-matched animals ( ). Thus, we proceeded by assessing whether a similar defect is present in the same mutant animals maintained in the outbred CD1 background, which have been used throughout this study, and whether a possible correlation exists between astrocytic cytoskeletal features and cortical defects. Our data confirmed the presence of a reduced thickness of the motor and somatosensory cortices also in   Mecp2   deficient CD1 mouse model, compared to the corresponding age-matched WT from the same litter ( ). In particular, in KO animals we observed a significant reduction of the thickness of whole layers of the motor and somatosensory cortices at all ages analyzed ( ). Conversely, the analysis of the thickness of layer I reported a significant decrement only at P40 and P70 ( ). \n  \n Mecp2   deficiency causes a reduction of the thickness of the motor and somatosensory cortex, which correlates with astrocytic atrophy.

Traced lines were used to measure the thickness of whole layers (A) and layer I (B) in the motor (white) and somatosensory cortex (yellow). Original magnification: 4\u00d7. Scale bar = 400 \u03bcm. (C\u2013F) The graphs depict changes in the thickness of whole cortical layers and layer I of the motor (C,D) and somatosensory cortices (E,F) of   Mecp2   null mice compared to their WT littermates, at different ages.

One-way ANOVA indicates a significant reduction in the thickness of whole layers of WT and KO motor and somatosensory cortices from P20 to P70 (  p   < 0.001); analysis of layer I reports a significant reduction from P20 to P70 in KO motor (  p   < 0.01) and somatosensory (  p   < 0.001) cortices, but not in WT tissues. Measurements of WT and KO brains derived from at least three non-consecutive slices of at least three different animals per genotype (P20:   N   = 4/5 WT and   N   = 4/6 KO; P40:   N   = 3 WT and   N   = 5 KO; P70:   N   = 5 WT and   N   = 5 KO). \n  \n\n### Transcriptional Alterations of Astrocyte-Enriched Genes in   Mecp2   KO Brains Confirm a Regional and Temporal Astrocyte Heterogeneity \n  \nThe described astrocyte atrophy might contribute to functional alterations, which could originate from and/or lead to transcriptional defects ( ;  ). We thus used qRT-PCR to assess whether   Mecp2   KO astrocytes suffer from transcriptional defects, which could differ depending on the cerebral regions and the disease progression. Instructed by our previous analyses, we selected for our studies a time point characterized by the absence or presence of mild morphological defects in KO astrocytes (i.e., P20 for motor and somatosensory cortex and P40 for the hippocampus), and a symptomatic time point, corresponding to P40 for the cortical samples and P70 for the hippocampus. To circumvent the limit of using samples containing multiple cell populations, we analyzed the expression of 16 genes selected from two comprehensive lists of transcripts predominantly expressed by astroglial cells ( ;  ), also considering their function and putative involvement in RTT or other intellectual disabilities. We grouped them according to their biological functions: astrocytic markers (  Gfap, Aldoc  , and   Aldh1l1  ), intercellular communication (  Gjb6   and   Gja1  ), homeostasis (  Aqp4, Scl1a2  , and   Grm3  ), synapse formation and elimination (  Chrdl1, Mfge8  , and   Mertk  ), extracellular matrix components (  Ptprz1, Hapln1  , and   Tnc  ), lipid metabolism (  Lcat  ) and mitochondrial metabolism (  Prodh  ). \n\nOur results indicate an overall transcriptional decrement, which depends on the brain region and the disease progression. In details, in the motor cortex, we reported a significant downregulation of 5 genes (  Aqp4, Grm3, Ptprz1, Hapln1  , and   Tnc  ) and a trend toward a decrement for   Lcat   in KO at P20. At P40, transcription of most genes was reduced, with 9 of them exhibiting a significant decrement. Interestingly, at both ages, mRNA levels of   Grm3  ,   Lcat   and genes encoding for extracellular matrix components were reduced, whereas astrocytic marker genes,   Chrdl1   and   Prodh   were not affected. Conversely, the P40 KO motor cortex exhibited a significant defect in the expression of genes involved in astrocyte communication (connexins) and synapse remodeling ( ). A similar progressive transcriptional defect was observed in the KO somatosensory cortex, that however, involved different genes. Indeed, only 4 genes (  Aqp4, Hapln1, Prodh  , and   Lcat  ) were found deregulated at P20, whilst almost half of the selected ones (  Aqp4, Hapln1, Lcat  ,   Aldh1l1, Grm3, Mertk  , and   Mfge8  ) were affected at P40. Only   Prodh   recovered its expression at P40 ( ). \n  \nTranscriptional expression of astrocytic genes in the motor cortex of early-symptomatic and moderate symptomatic   Mecp2   KO animals.

However, over the past 10 years, it gradually emerged the involvement of astrocytes in RTT as well as in other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X and Down syndrome ( ). Recent findings have also associated MeCP2 with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s diseases ( ), in which astrocytes undergo atrophy and asthenia affecting their homeostatic and protective functions ( ). \n\nHerein, we demonstrate the presence of atrophic features in   Mecp2   deficient astrocytes in the motor and somatosensory cortices (layer I) and CA1 area of dorsal hippocampus, indicating the occurrence of a progressive reduction in the complexity of mutant astrocytes, with a different temporal profile depending on the brain area, highlighting a regional heterogeneity. Additionally, in the heterozygous brain, astrocytes show a cytoskeletal impairment regardless of which   Mecp2   allele is expressed, with more pronounced defects in Mecp2  cells. Finally, transcriptional analysis of selected astrocyte-enriched genes proves a general downregulation, which deteriorates with time, suggesting a global defect in astrocyte maturation and functionality. \n\nIn this study, we focused our analyses on cerebral regions known to be involved in RTT pathology ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Regarding the analysis of cytoskeleton of cortical astrocytes, we selected GFAP  cells in layer I, which plays a crucial role in development, maturation and function of the cortex ( ) and which contains many astrocytes with high level of GFAP, smaller volume and different features compared to other layers ( ). We reported that, while in the motor cortex KO astrocytes display cytoskeletal alterations already during the early symptomatic stage with persistence of defects along time, in the somatosensory cortex astrocytes manifest a progressive impairment from P20 to P40, that was maintained at P70. Conversely, in the hippocampus,   Mecp2   deficiency induces an arrest of cytoskeletal growth only at later time points. Our results are in good accordance with previous data, demonstrating the presence of atrophic features with fewer and poorly branched ramifications of astrocytes in corpus callosum and dentate gyrus of the   Mecp2   mouse model ( ). Similarly, the conditional deletion of   Mecp2   in late juvenile animals induced hippocampal astrocytes to show a minor process complexity 18 weeks after deletion ( ). In accordance with our results, analysis on human brains indicated a less intense and widespread immunoreactivity of GFAP in RTT samples ( ) and human   MECP2   mutant iPSC-derived astrocytes display microtubule defects, indicative for cytoskeletal abnormalities ( ). \n\nThe molecular mechanisms behind cytoskeletal impairment in   Mecp2   deficient astrocytes are not understood, but some data point to defects in microtubules, which coextend with intermediate filaments to form the main processes ( ;  ). Indeed, an increased microtubule growth rate, indicative of a more destabilized state of cytoskeleton, was reported in astrocytes cultured from either   Mecp2   or   Mecp2   null animals, and a pharmacological intervention targeting Rho-GTPase, a group of enzymes implicated in cytoskeleton dynamics, reversed astrocyte atrophy ( ;  ). Additionally, HDAC6 inhibition rescued microtubule dynamics in   Mecp2   null astrocytes, concomitantly with an amelioration of behavioral outcomes in   Mecp2   mutant animals ( ). Further, molecular data highlighted the deregulation of a set of genes/proteins associated with cytoskeletal structure, maturation and morphology in the cortex of symptomatic   Mecp2   KO mice ( ). \n\nAlthough several neurobiological defects have been reported in RTT animal models and patients, a description of their progression along brain development has been provided only for few of them. For instance, a characteristic feature of RTT brain is microcephaly and   measured the cortical thickness, neuronal size and density as well as synaptic features in the somatosensory cortex of   Mecp2   KO animals at different ages, demonstrating a delay in cortical maturation. Besides confirming in   Mecp2   KO CD1 mouse the reduction of the thickness of whole cortical layers, we added novel data about the thickness of layer I, demonstrating a worsening along time; further, we noticed in WT animals a progressive reduction of whole cortical thickness along with brain maturation, in accordance with MRI data ( ). Interestingly, we observed a temporal correlation between the progressive thinning of layer I and the atrophy of astrocytes. Thus, although reduced cortical thickness has been mainly attributed to immature neurons with less and smaller spines ( ;  ;  ), we suggest that cytoskeletal atrophy in astrocytes might contribute to layer I cortical defects. \n\nImportantly, morphological alterations in astrocytes can negatively impact their proper functions, thus leading, as a consequence, to neuronal dysfunctions and synaptic defects. Indeed,   in vitro   experiments reported aberrant calcium signaling in   Mecp2   null astrocytes and their inability to correctly support neuronal maturation ( ;  ). Similar to RTT, strong evidence exists for neurodegenerative disorders in which astrocyte alterations impinge on neuronal health, affecting both morphological and functional features ( ). In order to have an insight on the functionality of   Mecp2   deficient astrocytes, we analyzed the transcriptional expression of astrocyte-enriched genes associated with specific functions. As previously observed in RTT models ( ;  ), our data point toward a global downregulation of transcription, which depends on the cerebral region and the disease stage. Considering that the expression of astrocytic markers is preserved in KO brains, the observed decrement in gene expression might not be attributed to a reduced number of astrocytes but rather to a defective maturation, in accordance with previous data ( ) and as already reported for null neurons ( ). Whatever the reason, the broad-spectrum of molecular alterations is indicative of a general impairment in astrocyte functionality. \n\nSeveral studies reported heterogeneity of astrocytes in terms of form and functions, both between and within cerebral regions ( ;  ). Thus, we considered important to characterize astrocyte cytoskeletal structure and molecular features in more than one cerebral area, reporting a heterogeneity of phenotypes among different brain regions. \n\nThe different onset and entity of astrocytic defects in   Mecp2   mutant brains in relation to the region residency might arise from different mechanisms, considering that astrocyte heterogeneity relies both on intrinsic signals and neuronal cues ( ;  ). Astrocytic defects might directly depend, at least in part, on   Mecp2   deficiency. In that case, phenotype might correlate with levels of the methyl binding protein. In possible good accordance, our data report that WT astrocytes express higher Mecp2 protein levels in layer I of both somatosensory and motor cortex with respect to hippocampus. However, considering that the Mecp2 deficient brain suffers from complex molecular and functional defects, we believe that other indirect factors can participate to the described astrocyte heterogeneity. For instance, we can suggest that a diverse signature of DNA methylation might play a role in the heterogeneity among inter-regional astrocytes, as reported for cortical and cerebellar astrocytes ( ). Further, considering that a plethora of different post-translational modifications (PTMs) generates and regulates the functional versatility of MeCP2 ( ), future studies should also investigate if different events of PTM affect Mecp2 functions in astrocytes. In parallel, alterations in neuronal activity, commonly detected in Mecp2 mutant brains, could reasonably affect astrocyte morphology and maturation. \n\nEventually, it is well recognized that biologically significant phenotypes observed in   Mecp2   null mice should be confirmed in female heterozygous models, which best represent the human condition ( ). We thus included in our study the analysis in the heterozygous cortex, where we found that astrocytes display signs of cytoskeletal atrophy independently from   Mecp2   expression, suggesting the occurrence of non-cell autonomous effects from   Mecp2   to   Mecp2   cells. Actually, the existence of non-cell autonomous mechanisms among RTT astrocytes has been already demonstrated and gap junctions-mediated mechanisms have been implicated ( ). However, since we used a heterozygous animal, we cannot rule out that non-cell autonomous effects could be mediated by other cells beyond astrocytes, a possibility that could be excluded analyzing astrocytes in a conditional heterozygous animal lacking   Mecp2   exclusively in these glial cells. \n\nTo conclude, our data describe the occurrence and progression of cytoskeletal and molecular alterations in astrocytes from   Mecp2   mutant animals, underlying once again the involvement of this cell population in the pathogenesis of RTT. Considering their role in brain communication and higher brain functions, such as cognition, and the fact that conditional re-expression of   Mecp2   in astrocytes improves behavioral outcomes ( ), astrocytes represent an interesting therapeutic target in RTT. However, our results suggest that the development of efficacious therapeutic strategies should consider astrocytic heterogeneity and the diversity of phenotypes, which affect these glial cells along the progression of the disease. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe animal study was reviewed and approved by the OPBA (Animal Welfare Organism) of University of Milan. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nAF, NL, and EA contributed to the conception and design of the study, and interpreted the results.
