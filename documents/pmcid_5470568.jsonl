While altered resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) has been also reported in IBS, the relationship between visceral hypersensitivity and aberrant rsFC is unknown. We therefore assessed rsFC within the salience, sensorimotor and default mode networks in patients with and without visceral hypersensitivity and in healthy controls (HCs).    An exploratory resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study was performed in 41 women with IBS and 20 HCs. Group independent component analysis was used to derive intrinsic brain networks. Rectal thresholds were determined and patients were subdivided into groups with increased (hypersensitive IBS, N\u00a0=\u00a021) or normal (normosensitive IBS, N\u00a0=\u00a020) visceral sensitivity. Between-group comparisons of rsFC were carried-out using region-of-interest analyses and peak rsFC values were extracted for correlational analyses.    Relative to normosensitive IBS, hypersensitive patients showed increased positive rsFC of pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus within the salience network and of posterior insula within the sensorimotor network. When compared to both hypersensitive IBS and HCs, normosensitive IBS showed decreased positive rsFC of amygdala and decreased negative rsFC in dorsal anterior insula within the DMN. DMN and sensorimotor network rsFC were associated with rectal perception thresholds, and rsFC in posterior insula was correlated with reported symptom severity in IBS.    Our exploratory findings suggest that visceral sensitivity in IBS is related to changes in FC within resting-state networks associated with interoception, salience and sensory processing. These alterations may play an important role in hypervigilance and hyperalgesia in IBS.      Graphical abstract      Image 1        Highlights       Functional connectivity (FC) was compared between hyper- and normosensitive IBS.      Hypersensitive IBS showed enhanced salience and sensorimotor network FC.      Normosensitive IBS had decreased amygdala and anterior insula FC within the DMN.      Changes in FC were associated with visceral sensitivity and symptom severity.      Altered FC may play a key role in hypervigilance and hyperalgesia in IBS.              BODY            Introduction    Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a chronic visceral pain syndrome defined by recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits with no detectable organic causes. In the absence of a reliable biomarker (  ,  ,  ), current concepts support an important role of enhanced visceral perception sensitivity (\u201cvisceral hypersensitivity\u201d) within a dysfunctional brain-gut axis (  ,  ,  ,  ). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have made a substantial contribution to elucidating central mechanisms involved in normal and altered processing of visceral stimuli, including the perception of visceral pain. They have provided important insights into functional alterations in response to experimentally induced pain in IBS, involving brain regions of visceral afferent processing, emotional arousal and endogenous pain modulation (  ). The investigation of spontaneous, stimulus-independent brain activation and connectivity of intrinsic brain networks by resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) extends knowledge derived from studies involving experimental pain models (  ). Existing rsfMRI studies in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) support altered functional connectivity (FC), with most consistently reported alterations in the default mode network (DMN), salience and sensorimotor networks (  ,  ).    Although visceral hypersensitivity is considered a key feature in the pathophysiology of FGIDs (  ,  ), a significant proportion of patients have visceral pain thresholds within the normal range (  ,  ,  ). Despite the absence of perceptual hypersensitivity to rectal distension, these patients exhibit chronic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and demonstrate alterations in brain responses to experimental pain stimuli (  ,  ,  ). Even though there is evidence suggesting differences between hypersensitive and normosensitive patients in response to painful stimuli (  ,  ), the relation between altered FC of brain networks and visceral sensitivity remains unknown. Using a data-driven approach (independent component analysis; ICA), the current exploratory rsfMRI study aimed to address differences within the DMN, salience and sensorimotor networks, as the intrinsic brain networks most consistently exhibiting alterations in IBS, in a sample of hyper- and normosensitive patients and healthy controls (HCs). IBS subgroups were subdivided based on sensory thresholding performed subsequent to rsfMRI by means of rectal distensions with a balloon catheter placed before scanning. We hypothesized alterations in FC within these networks to be related to visceral sensitivity in IBS, as evidenced by distinct changes in both hyper- and normosensitive patients. Specifically, we tested for group differences in FC in insular and cingulate subregions, thalamus, and amygdala, as brain regions consistently reported to be activated by visceral stimulation (  ). In addition, we addressed associations between changes in FC, visceral sensitivity, GI symptom severity and emotional disturbances in IBS.      Materials and methods     Participants    In total, 44 right-handed female IBS patients fulfilling Rome III diagnostic criteria were referred from primary care units and 20 age-matched, right-handed female HCs were recruited by local advertisement to participate in this fMRI study. Participants underwent a screening procedure including a standard clinical examination by a trained gastroenterologist to exclude organic GI diseases. In all patient, standard laboratory examination (minimum: hemoglobin, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein) and clinical examinations were performed before inclusion. Celiac disease was excluded by transglutaminase antibodies and f-calprotectin was used to screen for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients kept a gastrointestinal symptom diary for 2\u00a0weeks and were evaluated in terms of GI symptoms and alarm symptoms. Additional specific testing was performed when appropriate, e.g. colonoscopy when considered relevant for the exclusion of microscopic colitis. Lactose intolerance and bile acid malabsorption were excluded when appropriate. Further exclusion criteria were metabolic, neurological or severe psychiatric disorders, intake of nicotine or centrally acting medication, claustrophobia, pacemaker, large tattoos and metal implants in the brain. In HCs, a medical history of GI disturbances or complaints was exclusionary. All participants gave informed written consent and the Regional Research Committee for Ethical Issues at the Faculty of Health Sciences, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden, approved the study. HCs received a monetary compensation of 1000 Swedish kronor (approx. 105 \u20ac).      Study protocol     Resting-state fMRI data acquisition    All participants were tested between 8\u00a0a.m. and 5\u00a0p.m. and temporal overlap with menses was avoided. Participants were asked to cease medication and avoid alcohol consumption for at least 24\u00a0h and fast for at least 4\u00a0h before the experiment. After arrival, a rectal balloon catheter consisting of a noncompliant polyethylene bag (maximal volume 520\u00a0mL) attached to a polyethylene tube was placed according to a standard clinical procedure. Balloon placement before scanning was performed for patient convenience, avoiding effects of negative expectations regarding the placement procedure. Participants were given several minutes to habituate to the catheter before they were placed in the MR scanner and underwent a 5-minute adjustment phase to the scanner environment, during which no scanning was performed. Subsequent to this habituation phase, an eyes closed resting-state functional brain scan was acquired. MRI scanning was performed on a Philips Achieva 1.5\u00a0T whole-body MR scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) equipped with an 8-channel head coil, located at the Center of Medical Image Science and Visualization at the Link\u00f6ping University Hospital in Link\u00f6ping, Sweden. A blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) sensitive gradient echo, echo planar imaging sequence that effectively covered the whole brain was applied with the following acquisition parameters employed: Repetition time (TR)\u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0s; Echo time (TE)\u00a0=\u00a040\u00a0ms; flip angle (FA)\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0; voxel size 3x3x3 mm  ; slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0mm; gap\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u00a0mm; number of slices\u00a0=\u00a035; scan time\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0min. During scanning, participants were instructed to lie still with their eyes closed. Data from three IBS patients were excluded from further analyses due to intolerance of the MRI procedure (i.e. claustrophobia), resulting in a final sample of 41 IBS patients and 20 HCs, who reported no adverse effects of the fMRI measurement or balloon placement based on self-report, as assessed at the conclusion of rsfMRI. After the fMRI scan, participants were prompted to rate intensity and unpleasantness of currently experienced GI symptoms on scales ranging from 0 to 10 with 0 indicating no intensity/unpleasantness and 10 defined as very high intensity/unpleasantness.      Determination of perceptual thresholds    Following rsfMRI, visceral perceptual thresholds as measures of visceral sensitivity were determined with an electronic barostat (Dual Drive Barostat, Distender series II; G & J Electronics Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada). Specifically, intermittent phasic isobaric rectal balloon distensions of 30\u00a0seconds durations were delivered, and visceral sensitivity was assessed using an ascending method of limits with pressure increments of 5\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg, as previously described (  ). Subjects were prompted to rate each sensation on a 4-point scale labeled 0\u00a0=\u00a0no sensation, 1\u00a0=\u00a0first/some sensation, 2\u00a0=\u00a0urge to defecate and 3\u00a0=\u00a0maximal tolerable distension pressure. Based on the lower range of maximal tolerable pressures in HC (mean pressure 55\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg; range: 40\u201370\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg), IBS patients were classified as either normosensitive (N\u00a0=\u00a020, mean pressure 47.75\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg; range: 40\u201370\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg) or hypersensitive (N\u00a0=\u00a021, mean pressure 29.52\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg; range: 20\u201335\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg) with no overlap in maximal tolerable distension pressures between hypersensitive IBS and HCs. This classification procedure was previously implemented in the few existing studies comparing hypersensitive and normosensitive IBS (  ,  ). The lower range of maximal tolerable pressures in HCs is well in accordance with previously published maximal tolerable pressure volumes from visceral sensitivity testing assessed with comparable methodology in healthy women (  ).    Subsequent to rsfMRI and the thresholding procedure, a subset of participants included in the current study underwent an fMRI paradigm to investigate group-differences in cerebral responses to the expectation and presentation of standardized rectal distensions. Data from this fMRI study have previously been published (  ) and are not addressed here.       Questionnaires     Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)    In all participants, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to evaluate levels of anxiety and depression (  ). HADS consists of seven items addressing states of anxiety and depression, respectively, which are scored on a 4-point scale (0\u20133) with each sum score ranging from 0 to 21. Cut-off scores on each subscale are defined as \u2265\u00a08 for suspicious and \u2265\u00a011 for definite caseness. HADS has been validated in the general population as well as well in somatic, psychiatric and primary care patients (  ).      IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS)    In patients, the IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) was used to assess GI symptom severity (  ). The severity of abdominal pain, distension, stool frequency and consistency and interference of symptoms with daily life are evaluated on 0\u2013100\u00a0mm visual analogue scales (VAS). Sum scores range from 0 to 500 with mild cases defined as scores between 75 and 175, moderate severity as scores between 175 and 300 and severe cases of IBS as scores above 300.      Visceral Sensitivity Index (VSI)    The Visceral Sensitivity Index (VSI) was utilized to evaluate GI symptom-specific anxiety in patients, which is considered to play a key role in the pathophysiology and in health-related outcomes in IBS (  ). The 15-item questionnaire evaluates cognitive, emotional and behavioral responses to fear of GI sensations, symptoms and the context in which they are experienced. Items are scored on a reversed 6-point scale ranging from 0 to 5 with sum scores between 0 and 75 and higher scores indicating more severe GI-specific anxiety.       Resting-state fMRI data preprocessing    Functional imaging data were reconstructed on the scanner. All participants' images were separately realigned using the SPM-based toolbox INRIAlign (  ,  ) and the translation and rotation correction parameters were individually examined to exclude significant head motion larger than 1 voxel in any direction. Spatial normalization into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space was initially performed on the mean functional image volume for each participant, and these normalization parameters were then applied to each respective functional image set. The normalized images were smoothed with an 8\u00a0mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. All preprocessing steps were performed using SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL, London, UK) implemented in MATLAB R2015b (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA).      Independent component analysis    Functional connectivity was calculated using a group independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm (  ), as implemented in the group independent component analysis of fMRI toolbox (GIFT v4.0a;  ). A single ICA analysis was performed to identify spatially independent components across all 61 participants, with back reconstruction of single-subject spatial maps and time courses from the raw data (  ). To ensure reliability of the ICA algorithm and robustness of ICA results, 500 iterations were performed using ICASSO (  ,  ). Twenty-four spatially independent components were estimated using the Infomax algorithm, where the number of components in the data was determined using the minimum description length (MDL) criteria adjusted to account for correlated samples (  ). These 24 components were individually back-reconstructed for each subject. Group-level, one-sample   t   -statistic images were visually inspected, and components representing the DMN, salience and sensorimotor networks were defined using spatial regression with templates provided by  for further analyses. The results of spatial regression identified one component most strongly related to the salience network, one component representative of the sensorimotor network, and two components representing the DMN, a decomposition frequently observed (  ,  ,  ,  ). Within the full sample, the DMN components included precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), medial prefrontal cortex and parahippocampus. The component identified as the salience network encompassed ACC and anterior midcingulate cortex, bilateral anterior insula and thalamus. The sensorimotor network comprised primary somatosensory and motor cortices and supplementary motor area (SMA). Results from voxel-wise one sample-   t   -tests representing the regional strength of functional connectivity within these components were created across the whole sample, as visualized in  . Both the choice of preprocessing steps and group ICA analytic procedures were performed in accordance with the best practices laid out by  for the GIFT group ICA toolbox.

Fig. 1      Between-group differences in functional connectivity within the networks of interest were addressed in independent sample   t   -tests accomplished in SPM8. Region-of-interest (ROI) analyses with small volume correction were conducted using a priori defined ROIs. ROIs were selected based on both, previous findings on neural changes in response to pain stimuli related to visceral sensitivity in FGID (  ,  ) and most consistently reported task-based and resting-state functional alterations in patients, particularly involving brain regions related to visceral afferent processing, emotional arousal and endogenous pain modulation (  ,  ). Of note, ROIs were chosen independent of their presence within the previously defined networks of interest in this exploratory approach, taking also negative findings into consideration. ROIs were custom-made as previously described (  ) and included amygdala, insula (dorsal and ventral anterior, mid and posterior division), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; pregenual (pACC) and subgenual ACC (sgACC)), anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) and thalamus. Alpha-level for accepting statistical significance was set at   p   \u00a0<\u00a00.05 with Family Wise Error (FWE) correction for multiple testing. No correction for number of groups, ROIs or networks tested was applied in this exploratory analysis. Results from ROI analyses are given as MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) coordinates. For ROIs showing significant between-group differences, peak FC values for each participant were extracted and entered into correlational analyses with visceral thresholds, clinical characteristics and psychological variables as described below.      Statistical analyses of non-fMRI data    Statistical analyses of non-fMRI data were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 23 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). As the Shapiro Wilk test revealed non-normality of threshold data, nonparametric tests were implemented for all analyses. Comparisons of IBS subgroups and healthy controls with respect to age and HADS anxiety and depression scores were addressed using Kruskal-Wallis test followed by post-hoc Mann-Whitney   U   tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Differences between hyper- and normosensitive IBS regarding IBS-SSS and VSI scores were accomplished with Mann-Whitney   U   tests. Alpha-level for all statistical tests was set at   p   \u00a0<\u00a00.05 and results are reported as Mean (M)\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Standard Error of the Mean (SEM), unless indicated otherwise.      Correlational analyses    Correlational analyses of non-fMRI data and peak FC values were performed using Spearman's rank correlations. Specifically, associations between visceral thresholds and symptoms of anxiety and depression were addressed in all participants and within the patient sample. Correlational analyses of self-reported symptom severity and GI symptom-specific anxiety were performed for the IBS sample. Alpha-level was set at   p   \u00a0<\u00a00.05.       Results     Differences in visceral thresholds in a priori defined IBS subgroups and HC    The Kruskal-Wallis tests, initially used to confirm differences in visceral thresholds, revealed a significant group effect for all thresholds assessed. Specifically, group effects were not only detected for maximal tolerable pressure (H  \u00a0=\u00a042.996;   p   \u00a0<\u00a00.001), as expected, but also for thresholds of first sensation (H  \u00a0=\u00a013.558;   p   \u00a0=\u00a00.001) and urgency (H  \u00a0=\u00a019.316;   p   \u00a0<\u00a00.001) with substantially lower pressures in hypersensitive IBS compared to both, normosensitive patients and HCs (  ).

Fig. 2        Sample characteristics and questionnaire data    Statistical details from comparisons between HC, normosensitive and hypersensitive IBS with respect to GI symptom ratings and questionnaires are given in  . The groups differed significantly with respect to ratings of intensity (H  \u00a0=\u00a028.444;   p   \u00a0<\u00a00.001) and unpleasantness (H  \u00a0=\u00a024.616;   p   \u00a0<\u00a00.001) of current GI symptoms, assessed after the resting-state fMRI session. Hypersensitive IBS reported the highest levels of intensity and unpleasantness of all three groups, while normosensitive IBS reported greater intensity and unpleasantness of current GI symptoms than HCs. While group differences were further observed for anxiety (H  \u00a0=\u00a020.325;   p   \u00a0<\u00a00.001) and depression (H  \u00a0=\u00a016.079;   p   \u00a0<\u00a00.001) with significantly higher scores in both IBS groups compared to HCs, no differences were observed between hyper- and normosensitive IBS. IBS symptoms, as assessed with IBS-SSS, were moderate to severe in both IBS subgroups with higher scores in hypersensitive when compared to normosensitive patients. Both patient groups reported comparable levels of GI symptom-specific anxiety.     Clinical characteristics in hypersensitive and normosensitive IBS patients and in healthy controls.     Table 1                    FC within DMN, salience and sensorimotor networks    Within the DMN, hypersensitive IBS patients had increased positive FC of the right amygdala and increased negative connectivity in the left dorsal anterior insula compared to normosensitive IBS patients (  A;  ). In parallel, HCs also had increased positive FC of the right amygdala within the DMN along with increased negative FC of the left dorsal anterior insula compared to normosensitive IBS (  B;  ). Furthermore, comparisons of hypersensitive IBS and HCs revealed increased positive FC of mid insula in patients (  ).     Group differences in DMN connectivity.

Table 2        Within the salience network, hypersensitive IBS exhibited increased positive FC of pgACC and thalamus compared to normosensitive patients (  ). Within the sensorimotor network, we observed increased FC of posterior insula in hypersensitive relative to normosensitive patients (  ). When comparing all IBS as a group and HCs, increased FC of aMCC within the sensorimotor network (x\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a04; y\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a06; z\u00a0=\u00a034;   t   \u00a0=\u00a04.03;   p   \u00a0=\u00a00.042) was observed in patients.     Group differences in FC between IBS subgroups within salience and sensorimotor networks [hypersensitive\u00a0>\u00a0normosensitive IBS].     Table 3          Correlations between FC, visceral thresholds and clinical characteristics    In IBS, significant negative correlations between peak connectivity of amygdala within DMN and thresholds for first sensation (r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.439;   p   \u00a0=\u00a00.005), urgency (r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.511;   p   \u00a0=\u00a00.001) and for maximal tolerable pressure (r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.580;   p   \u00a0<\u00a00.001) were detected. Similarly, FC values extracted from dorsal anterior insula, which decrease with higher negative FC, correlated significantly with maximal tolerable pressure (r  \u00a0=\u00a00.415;   p   \u00a0=\u00a00.007). Correlations with first sensation (r  \u00a0=\u00a00.297;   p   \u00a0=\u00a00.067) and urgency (r  \u00a0=\u00a00.302;   p   \u00a0=\u00a00.062) did not reach statistical significance. Also, no significant correlations with peak FC within DMN were detected in the full sample including HCs. Within the salience network, FC of pACC and thalamus yielded no significant associations with thresholds or clinical characteristics. Within the sensorimotor network, peak FC of posterior insula was significantly related to urgency (r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.382;   p   \u00a0=\u00a00.003) and maximal tolerable pressure (r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.277;   p   \u00a0=\u00a00.031) within the full sample. Posterior insula FC was further associated with symptom severity in IBS (r  \u00a0=\u00a00.341;   p   \u00a0=\u00a00.029;  ). No associations between FC and measures of anxiety, depression or GI symptom-specific anxiety were evident.     Correlation between posterior insula FC and IBS symptom severity.

Fig. 4         Discussion    This exploratory study addressed resting-state FC in DMN, salience and sensorimotor networks in IBS patients with and without visceral hypersensitivity and healthy controls. Our study focused on region-specific alterations in connectivity within the context of canonical resting-state networks. In addition to being well-suited to identify large-scale neural networks, ICA was selected as our analytic approach, as it is less sensitive to confounding factors such as physiologic noise and head motion compared with either seed-based or graph-based approaches (  ,  ). ROI analyses revealed group-specific alterations within all three networks of interest.     Default mode network    The most prominent group differences were detected within the DMN, an intrinsic brain network involved in self-referential processing (  ) including the monitoring of the body and emotional states (  ,  ). As the network most strongly affected in chronic pain (  ), altered DMN connectivity has been reported in several chronic pain conditions (  ,  ), including IBS (  ). The present analysis is the first to support specific alterations within the DMN related to visceral sensitivity in a female patient population with moderate to severe IBS. Consistent with our general hypothesis, hypersensitive and normosensitive IBS differed with respect to amygdala and dorsal anterior insula connectivity within DMN, attributable to increased FC in the hypersensitive group. This result is interesting given that both amygdala and dorsal anterior insula serve as key hubs in the integration of interoceptive signals with emotional and cognitive aspects (  ,  ,  ,  ). Aberrant function of these regions has consistently been reported in IBS, both in response to visceral stimulation (  ,  ) and at rest (  ,  ), in support of their putative role in IBS pathophysiology, involving visceral processing. Evidence further suggests a role of dorsal anterior insula in attentional processes and higher cognitive function (  ). Negative FC within the DMN, as observed here, is therefore well in line with the involvement of dorsal anterior insula in task-positive networks (  ) as well as a recently described anticorrelation with regions of the DMN as a task-negative network in IBS (  ).    When comparing the IBS groups with HCs, we observed reduced positive amygdala FC and reduced negative dorsal anterior insula FC in normosensitive IBS patients. Unexpectedly, the comparison between hypersensitive IBS and HCs revealed essentially identical FC in these regions. In other words, our results suggested that FC within the DMN is altered in normosensitive IBS compared to both hypersensitive patients as well as a healthy population. This finding is difficult to reconcile with the few existing studies in IBS that have demonstrated enhanced positive amygdala FC with corticolimbic regions (  ), and enhanced negative FC with regions of the DMN (  ). However, there are several methodological differences, which may explain our findings. Specifically, subjects in previous studies were not characterized with respect to visceral sensitivity, and different analytical approaches were used (i.e., seed-based versus data-driven approaches). Most importantly, the distinctive methodological feature of balloon placement before scanning herein might have induced constant subliminal stimulation. This may have particularly affected DMN as a task-negative network, inducing the involvement of the amygdala as a brain region generally not associated with the DMN. In light of similar FC patterns in hypersensitive patients and healthy women, one may speculate that decreased FC of amygdala and dorsal anterior insula in normosensitive patients reflects a form of corticolimbic inhibition involving a downregulation of attentional and emotional processes. Modulating visceral afferent input under resting conditions could therefore be a compensatory mechanism allowing maintenance of normal visceral sensitivity despite chronic GI symptoms.      Salience network    The IBS groups also differed in salience network FC. Specifically, increased connectivity of pACC and thalamus within the salience network was observed in hypersensitive relative to normosensitive patients. These two regions, as part of a large-scale network, are involved in the integration of sensory input, including nociceptive afferent signals. The pACC, particularly, is involved in affective information processing (  ) and pain modulation through attentional processes (  ), as previously also demonstrated in IBS (  ). Using task-based fMRI, the only two existing studies testing the role of visceral sensitivity in neural response to visceral stimuli in FGIDs revealed involvement of cingulate regions in hypersensitive when compared to normosensitive patients (  ,  ). Enhanced connectivity of pACC and thalamus may therefore reflect increased attentional and modulatory resources regarding both affective responses and visceral afferent signaling under resting conditions in patients with heightened visceral sensitivity. This may contribute to GI-related hypervigilance, especially in hypersensitive patients.      Sensorimotor network    Within the sensorimotor network, hypersensitive patients demonstrated enhanced FC of posterior insula relative to normosensitive IBS. As the primary interoceptive cortex, the posterior insula is considered a key region of interoceptive processing, providing a homeostatic representation of the physiological state of the body (  ). It plays a crucial role in multimodal convergence of sensorimotor information, particularly involving the processing of visceral signals and pain (  ). This is in line with increased distension-induced neural activation in hypersensitive patients, as recently observed (  ). Enhanced posterior insula FC within the sensorimotor network may therefore reflect increased ascending input and enhanced processing of visceral signals in patients with visceral hypersensitivity. This inference is further supported by posterior insula FC correlating with symptom severity in patients and with thresholds for urgency and maximal tolerable pressure in all participants. These findings extend a recent report demonstrating a positive association between visceral sensitivity and symptom severity in IBS (  ), by suggesting resting-state FC of posterior insula as a neural correlate of this relation.      Limitations and future directions    The current study is not without limitations. We cannot exclude that balloon placement performed prior to scanning or the empty balloon catheter, in terms of a subliminal stimulus, affected FC in the current study. We have chosen this protocol for patient convenience, particularly to eliminate negative expectations of the often fear-evoking placement procedure itself. Participants were given time outside and inside the scanner to habituate to the balloon catheter and to the reportedly stress-evoking scanner environment (  ). However, the observed group differences may reflect alterations in central processing of tonic subliminal afferent stimulation arising from the GI tract in patient subgroups. Importantly, this possibility raises a general question of crucial importance for brain imaging studies implementing distension stimuli. In task-based fMRI paradigms, the balloon catheter is present throughout all experimental phases and may induce differential neural responses not only during distension, but also in the deflated state. At the same time, it points towards a highly relevant future direction of research, addressing the impact of tonic subliminal visceral stimulation, which may for example be induced by low-grade inflammatory processes, on brain function and FC in health and FGIDs. Furthermore, in the current protocol sensory thresholding followed by an experimental paradigm involving rectal distensions (  ) subsequent to rsfMRI may have induced responses related to the anticipation of the following aversive procedure. Additionally, while a recent study revealed no group differences between IBS and controls regarding effects of the scanner environment on visceral pain perception, increases in pain intensity ratings inside the scanner observed in both groups appeared to be associated with psychological factors such as stress and anxiety (  ). Future studies should therefore take effects of arousal, state anxiety and stress into account, which we cannot fully rule-out to have affected sensory testing to different extents in our sample of healthy women and IBS patients with high psychological symptom burden, and which may have profound influences on brain function and FC. Evidence supporting sex differences in functional and structural brain alterations in IBS is accumulating (  ,  ,  ,  ). Inferences drawn from findings obtained in women herein therefore cannot be directly translated to men suffering from IBS. Recent findings further suggest an influence of menstrual cycle phase and intake of oral contraceptives on rsFC in women (  ,  ). While excluding time of menses, females independent of hormonal status were included in the current study. Future research should consider the putative impact of sex hormones and their natural fluctuations, which might distinctly affect not only visceral sensitivity but also brain connectivity in patients. Finally, our results from FWE-corrected ROI analyses were not additionally corrected for multiple comparisons regarding number of groups, networks or ROIs, yielding them exploratory in nature due to the risk of false-positive results.      Conclusion    While warranting cautious interpretation, our findings provide new evidence connecting visceral hypersensitivity, as defined by decreased thresholds to experimental visceral stimulation (  ), and brain mechanisms in IBS. Under resting conditions, group differences related to visceral sensitivity may be induced by enhanced sensory input from the gut, or centrally-mediated modulatory processes. Our findings are consistent with both mechanisms contributing to central alterations related to visceral sensitivity in IBS. Group differences in salience and sensorimotor networks may reflect enhanced ascending input as well as increased attentional resources in hypersensitive patients, calling for future research to delineate top-down and bottom-up processes and their possible interactions in visceral hypersensitivity. Although speculative, distinct connectivity patterns within the DMN suggest that normosensitive patients maintain visceral sensitivity within a normal range via central pathways, potentially involving a regulation of attentional and emotional processes. Hyper- and normosensitive patients may therefore differ with respect to both origin of symptoms and regulatory resources, which may have profound consequences when investigating mechanisms contributing to IBS pathophysiology. Further research should therefore address the putative role of corticolimbic inhibition (  ) and psychological factors (  ), including coping skills or other resilience mechanisms (  ) in the regulation of visceral sensitivity, which may be of crucial relevance to visceral hyperalgesia and hypervigilance in IBS.", "utf8_text_md5_checksum": "49e624fb242203c224ab01debed8f76b"}
