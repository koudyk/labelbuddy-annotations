We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE database for studies that examined the magnitude of association between baseline rs-fMRI assessment and subsequent response to antipsychotic treatment in persons with schizophrenia. We also performed meta-analyses for quantifying the magnitude and accuracy of predicting response defined continuously and categorically. Data from 22 datasets examining 1280 individuals identified striatal and default mode network functional segregation and integration metrics as consistent determinants of treatment response. The pooled correlation coefficient for predicting improvement in total symptoms measured continuously was ~0.47 (12 datasets; 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.59). The pooled odds ratio of predicting categorically defined treatment response was 12.66 (nine datasets; 95% CI: 7.91-20.29), with 81% sensitivity and 76% specificity. rs-fMRI holds promise as a predictive biomarker of antipsychotic treatment response in schizophrenia. Future efforts need to focus on refining feature characterization to improve prediction accuracy, validate prediction models, and evaluate their implementation in clinical practice.
