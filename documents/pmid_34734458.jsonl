In contrast, meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies in chronic pain conditions have not revealed convergent evidence for robust alterations during experimental pain induction. Against this background, the present neuroimaging meta-analysis combined three different meta-analytic approaches with stringent study selection criteria for case-control functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments during acute pain processing with a focus on chronic pain disorders. Convergent neurofunctional dysregulations in chronic pain patients were observed in the left anterior insula cortex. Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity based on a large publicly available dataset combined with a meta-analytic task-based approach identified the anterior insular region as a key node of an extended bilateral insula-fronto-cingular network, resembling the salience network. Moreover, the meta-analytic decoding showed that this region presents a high probability to be specifically activated during pain-related processes, although we cannot exclude an involvement in autonomic processes. Together, the present findings indicate that dysregulated left anterior insular activity represents a robust neurofunctional maladaptation and potential treatment target in chronic pain disorders.
