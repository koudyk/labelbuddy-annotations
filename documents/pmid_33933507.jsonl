Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine alterations in brain activations during response inhibition in addicted individuals. We characterized imaging findings based on substance use status, diagnosis, substance classes, and task performance. Results revealed in those with active drug addiction hypoactivation of the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), compared with healthy controls. Weakening of the dACC and MFG activations was particularly pronounced in nicotine users, respectively. Impaired task performance was also associated with diminished MFG activation. In contrast, abstinent users did not exhibit any significant differences compared with healthy controls. Those with behavioral addictions were characterized by higher midcingulate cortical activation. Thus, the neural disengagement during response inhibition in active drug addiction was limited to a small number of prefrontal cortical regions and dependent on population characteristics. Finally, the evidence for potential normalization of hypofrontality following substance use cessation highlights the benefits of abstinence in restoring cerebral functions.
