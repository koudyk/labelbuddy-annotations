Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies comparing VS activity during monetary reward processing between patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders or clinical or genetic high-risk state for psychosis and healthy controls.

The meta-analysis included 23 studies (917 patients) for reward anticipation, 9 studies (358 patients) for reward feedback, and 8 studies (314 patients) for reward prediction error. We found significant bilateral VS hypoactivation during reward anticipation (23 studies, n\u2009=\u2009917) in patients compared with healthy controls (left/right Cohen d, -0.50/-0.70; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Left VS abnormality was more severe in patients with high scores of negative symptoms during reward anticipation (r\u2009=\u2009-0.41; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Patients also showed hypoactivation during reward feedback (left/right d, -0.57/-0.56; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Simulations showed that exclusion of studies with nonstatistically significant unreported effects was associated with a strong bias (d bias\u2009=\u20090.22), whereas estimations using MetaNSUE were unbiased even when statistics were seldom reported (d bias\u2009<\u20090.001). This meta-analysis provides evidence that patients with psychosis demonstrate VS hypoactivation during reward anticipation. The assessment of VS prediction errors seems to be promising, but more studies are needed to draw valid conclusions.
