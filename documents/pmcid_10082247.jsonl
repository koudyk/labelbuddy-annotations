Introduction \n  \nSleep is an important physiological phenomenon of the human body, and normal sleep is an important guarantee for maintaining a healthy state of life and basic life activities. Sleep quality directly affects people's behavior, cognition, and even physical and mental health. With the acceleration of the pace of life and the increasing pressure from external factors such as society, environment, and working style, sleep deprivation (SD) has become the new normal of modern people, and the overall sleep duration has been on a long-term downward trend globally.  According to the sleep status survey of adult residents in 15 provinces of China in 2015, 9.8% of adults have the problem of sleep deficiency, , especially for a series of workers with occupational characteristics such as high load, shift work, and sleep disorders, the sleep ratio is seriously disordered.  Previous studies have shown that SD can cause individual abnormalities in emotion, learning, and memory,  such as mood change, memory decline, alertness, attention decline, executive decision-making ability decline, and so on, leading to accidents and diseases.  Therefore, how to reduce the negative impact of SD on the cognitive dysfunction of workers in all walks of life has become a key issue to be solved. \n\nThe pathogenesis of SD associated with cognitive disorders is not very clear at present, in modern medicine, awakening promoters, and receptor inhibitors are the main drugs to promote sleep and improve cognition.  Although these drugs can extend the patients\u2019 sleep time and improve cognition, they cannot solve the underlying problem of sleep deficiency and have great side effects in the long term. As the treasure of China, traditional Chinese acupuncture has a long history, safety, and effectiveness, and has been widely respected in clinical application. A large number of animal experiments and related clinical studies have confirmed the safety and effect of acupuncture in the treatment of SD with cognitive dysfunction,  but the specific mechanism remains to be further explored. \n\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a commonly used technique to study brain function. rs-fMRI uses magnetic resonance equipment to detect changes in blood oxygen levels during brain activity, so as to identify and locate brain functional areas and provide strong evidence for the study of complex brain activities.  It is one of the most commonly used technical means for brain function research at present. Studies using rs-fMRI have shown that SD is associated with arousal, emotion, reward, and abnormal functional activity in cognitive areas of the brain.  It is not only associated with abnormal functioning of local brain regions but also with abnormal internal connections of the default network, the prominence network, and the emotional network.  rs-fMRI has been used to study the mechanism of acupuncture in treating diseases.  Due to the different testing standards and sample sizes of testing equipment and analysis software, the results are inconsistent. Therefore, the meta-analysis method was used in this study to conduct an integrated analysis of the changes of low-frequency fluctuation amplitude (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (Re Ho) and to explore the characteristics and rules of the changes of brain activity in patients with cognitive dysfunction induced by SD with acupuncture, so as to provide effective evidence for clarifying the pathogenesis. \n\n\n## 2. Methods and analysis \n  \nThe protocol of this meta-analysis will be conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols statement guidelines.

Selections of studies. \n  \nClinical studies will be identified and reviewed by 2 independent reviewers (QL and YW). In order to ensure that the reviewers have a good understanding of the background and purpose of the review, they will be trained in advance. Use Note Express 3.2.0 software ( ) to independently manage the search results from the above-mentioned databases. First, remove the duplicate literature. Afterward, after reviewing the title and abstract, exclude the literature that does not comply with the standard. Finally, further review the full text and rule out the literature that is not in line with the standard. Any disagreements related to study selection results will be discussed after cross-checking and arbitrated by the third reviewer (W.Y.). The flow diagram of all study selection procedures is shown in Figure  . \n  \nPRISMA flow diagram of study and exclusion. PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. \n  \n\n#### 2.3.2. Data extraction. \n  \nTwo reviewers (QL and YW) will independently select literature and extract data in accordance with the retrieval strategy. If there are differences of opinion, the third reviewer (X.G.) will participate in the discussion. According to the designed data extraction table, the basic information of the study includes: \n  \nIdentification information (article title, publication time, first author, and journal); \n  \nGeneral information (country, type of study, sample size, test design, and diagnosis standard); \n  \nParticipants (age, sex, and pretreatment fMRI results); \n  \nIntervention measures (acupuncture type, point selection, and treatment frequency/course of treatment/duration; administration time); \n  \nComparator (if any, details of treatment, including treatment method, frequency, and course of treatment); \n  \nResults (time, scale, and fMRI result points of each measurement, including Re Ho and ALFF, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Montreal cognitive assessment, psychomotor vigilance test, Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, follow-up time, and adverse events). \n  \n\n\n### 2.4. Risk of bias assessment \n  \nTwo independent reviewers (S.M. and W.Y.) will assess the risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool according to the Cochrane Handbook 5.1.0 for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The 2 reviewers will assess 7 items, which consist of the risk of bias of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants personnel and outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other biases. If there is disagreement during the assessing process, 2 reviewers will discuss or consult the third reviewer (X.G.) for a decision. Three evaluation grades are low, unclear, and high risk of bias. \n\n\n### 2.5. Measures of treatment effect \n  \nMean differences with 95% confidence intervals will present as continuous data. Also, the risk ratio will be the expression of dichotomous data. \n\n\n### 2.6. Dealing with missing data \n  \nWe will e-mail the corresponding author to obtain the necessary information, which is missing or insufficient. Otherwise, we will analyze the existing information and conduct a sensitivity analysis to address the potential impact of missing data. \n\n\n### 2.7. Assessment of heterogeneity \n  \n I   will be used for assessing statistical heterogeneity. It is acknowledged that   I  \u2005<\u200525% indicates negligible heterogeneity, 25%\u2005<\u2005  I  \u2005<\u200550% indicates mild heterogeneity, 50%\u2005<\u2005  I  \u2005<\u200575% moderate heterogeneity, and   I  \u2005\u2265\u200575% high heterogeneity. \n\n\n### 2.8. Assessment of reporting bias \n  \nOver 10 studies included, we will take advantage of funnel plot to assess the reporting bias. Symmetrical funnel indicates no publishing bias, but if the funnel is not symmetrical, which indicates publishing bias exists.   P   value will be utilized, while <10 studies included. \n\n\n### 2.9. Data syntheses \n  \nWe will take advantage of Rev Man software (version 5.4) for Statistical analyses performing. Only if there is no or mild significant heterogeneity (  I  ), we will apply the fixed-effect model, or the random-effects model will be selected. \n\n\n### 2.10. Analysis of subgroups or subsets \n  \nSubgroup analysis will be conducted to evaluate the specific influence of intervention type, acupoints selection, and treatment duration on pooled results. If the data is insufficient, qualitative synthesis will be conducted instead of quantitative synthesis. \n\n\n### 2.11. Sensitivity analysis \n  \nThe robustness of the results will be assessed by sensitivity analysis performance which will focus on the processing method of missing data. \n\n\n### 2.12. Grading the quality of evidence \n  \nAccording to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation method, 2 reviewers (W.Y. and X.G.) will use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation rating standards to independently assess the quality of evidence for each outcome as 4 levels: \u201cvery low,\u201d \u201clow,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d quality. The quality of evidence will be assessed according to the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. \n\n\n### 2.13. Ethics and dissemination \n  \nDue to nothing of the information will be obtained from an individual participant, the systematic review does not need ethical approval or patient consent. The results of this meta-analysis will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. \n\n\n\n## 3. Discussion \n  \nCurrently, it is believed that the neurobiological mechanism of post-SD cognitive impairment is mainly through changing the metabolism of brain substances to structural and functional damage neurons in different brain regions, and thus impair cognitive function.  Studies on the mechanism of SD influence on cognitive function based on fMRI technology mainly focus on the brain functional connection and its connection with cognitive function and other neurobehavioral studies. For example, in the study on the effect of SD on alertness and attention function based on fMRI technology, it was found that SD had a negative effect on the attention function network, and the mechanism might be that SD weakened the functional connection between the dorsal attention network system of the brain and other brain regions.  In terms of learning and memory, someone  studied short-term memory disorders with the hippocampus as the seed point and found that SD reduced the functional connections between the hippocampus and superior frontal gyrus, temporal lobe, and auxiliary motor area, indicating that the abnormal functional connections between hippocampus and cortex after SD were related to the reduction of short-term memory. In addition, studies have shown that  SD could lead to the dysfunction of the functional connectivity of the hippocampus, thus affecting the process of memory consolidation and damaging long-term memory. In terms of executive decision-making ability, it is reported  that the accuracy of recognizing neutral and positive words in the SD population decreased, and the activation of the dorsolateral frontal cortex was enhanced when recognizing positive words, while the activation of the insula was enhanced when recognizing emotional words, indicating that SD can affect the judgment, decision making, and executive ability, and is closely related to the dorsolateral frontal cortex and insula in the brain. In conclusion, rs-fMRI is an important brain imaging technique for the study of cognitive dysfunction in SD patients. \n\nThe application of acupuncture can improve sleep quality, reduce the occurrence of adverse events related to sleep disorders, and alleviate the negative effects of SD on cognitive function, which is safe and effective. Previous studies have reported that acupuncture San Yin Jiao Point (SP6)  can improve the activity intensity of the default network, precuneus anterior lobe, cingulate gyrus, and other brain regions, and strengthen the interaction between the frontal lobe and temporal lobe, and the connection of synchronous neural network, indicating that acupuncture of SP6 has a strong ability of integration and regulation of mental intelligence, emotion regulation, and brain cognitive dysfunction. \n\nIn recent years, relevant researches on exploring the mechanism of acupuncture for SD comorbid with cognitive decline on rs-fMRI have been reported, but there has been no systematic review and meta-analysis. This study will integrate all the latest relevant literature in this field to explore the effects of acupuncture on the brain activity of patients with SD and cognitive dysfunction. However, due to the lack of relevant clinical research literature, correlation analysis such as subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis may not be possible. In addition, heterogeneity may exist between studies due to the use of different evaluation criteria and intervention methods. In conclusion, the purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide an evidence-based medical basis for clarifying the central nervous system mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of SD comorbid with cognitive dysfunction. \n\n\n## Acknowledgment \n  \nWe appreciate the financial support received from the Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province (No. YDZJ202101ZYTS103) \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \n Conceptualization:   Xiaole Guo. \n\n Data curation:   Ying Wang, Qi Lu. \n\n Formal analysis:   Weiwan Yang, Shiqi Ma. \n\n Funding acquisition:   Hongfeng Wang. \n\n Investigation:   Xiaole Guo, Weiwan Yang. \n\n Supervision:   Hongfeng Wang. \n\n Validation:   Ying Wang, Shiqi Ma. \n\n Writing \u2013 original draft:   Xiaole Guo. \n\n Writing \u2013 review & editing:   Xiaole Guo, Hongfeng Wang. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 10082247, "text_md5": "36ae7eb9d9ce10c358499fd7314d989d", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 87], "journal": [88, 91], "publication_year": [93, 97], "title": [108, 261], "keywords": [275, 358], "abstract": [371, 1856], "body": [1865, 19196]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 37026925, "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000033490", "pmcid": "10082247", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10082247", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10082247"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10082247\">10082247</a>", "list_title": "PMC10082247  Study on acupuncture improving sleep deprivation comorbid with cognitive dysfunction based on rs-fMRI: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis"}

Introduction \n  \nSleep is an important physiological phenomenon of the human body, and normal sleep is an important guarantee for maintaining a healthy state of life and basic life activities. Sleep quality directly affects people's behavior, cognition, and even physical and mental health. With the acceleration of the pace of life and the increasing pressure from external factors such as society, environment, and working style, sleep deprivation (SD) has become the new normal of modern people, and the overall sleep duration has been on a long-term downward trend globally.

Otherwise, we will analyze the existing information and conduct a sensitivity analysis to address the potential impact of missing data. \n\n\n### 2.7. Assessment of heterogeneity \n  \n I   will be used for assessing statistical heterogeneity. It is acknowledged that   I  \u2005<\u200525% indicates negligible heterogeneity, 25%\u2005<\u2005  I  \u2005<\u200550% indicates mild heterogeneity, 50%\u2005<\u2005  I  \u2005<\u200575% moderate heterogeneity, and   I  \u2005\u2265\u200575% high heterogeneity. \n\n\n### 2.8. Assessment of reporting bias \n  \nOver 10 studies included, we will take advantage of funnel plot to assess the reporting bias. Symmetrical funnel indicates no publishing bias, but if the funnel is not symmetrical, which indicates publishing bias exists.   P   value will be utilized, while <10 studies included. \n\n\n### 2.9. Data syntheses \n  \nWe will take advantage of Rev Man software (version 5.4) for Statistical analyses performing. Only if there is no or mild significant heterogeneity (  I  ), we will apply the fixed-effect model, or the random-effects model will be selected. \n\n\n### 2.10. Analysis of subgroups or subsets \n  \nSubgroup analysis will be conducted to evaluate the specific influence of intervention type, acupoints selection, and treatment duration on pooled results. If the data is insufficient, qualitative synthesis will be conducted instead of quantitative synthesis. \n\n\n### 2.11. Sensitivity analysis \n  \nThe robustness of the results will be assessed by sensitivity analysis performance which will focus on the processing method of missing data. \n\n\n### 2.12. Grading the quality of evidence \n  \nAccording to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation method, 2 reviewers (W.Y. and X.G.) will use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation rating standards to independently assess the quality of evidence for each outcome as 4 levels: \u201cvery low,\u201d \u201clow,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d quality. The quality of evidence will be assessed according to the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. \n\n\n### 2.13. Ethics and dissemination \n  \nDue to nothing of the information will be obtained from an individual participant, the systematic review does not need ethical approval or patient consent. The results of this meta-analysis will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. \n\n\n\n## 3. Discussion \n  \nCurrently, it is believed that the neurobiological mechanism of post-SD cognitive impairment is mainly through changing the metabolism of brain substances to structural and functional damage neurons in different brain regions, and thus impair cognitive function.  Studies on the mechanism of SD influence on cognitive function based on fMRI technology mainly focus on the brain functional connection and its connection with cognitive function and other neurobehavioral studies. For example, in the study on the effect of SD on alertness and attention function based on fMRI technology, it was found that SD had a negative effect on the attention function network, and the mechanism might be that SD weakened the functional connection between the dorsal attention network system of the brain and other brain regions.  In terms of learning and memory, someone  studied short-term memory disorders with the hippocampus as the seed point and found that SD reduced the functional connections between the hippocampus and superior frontal gyrus, temporal lobe, and auxiliary motor area, indicating that the abnormal functional connections between hippocampus and cortex after SD were related to the reduction of short-term memory. In addition, studies have shown that  SD could lead to the dysfunction of the functional connectivity of the hippocampus, thus affecting the process of memory consolidation and damaging long-term memory. In terms of executive decision-making ability, it is reported  that the accuracy of recognizing neutral and positive words in the SD population decreased, and the activation of the dorsolateral frontal cortex was enhanced when recognizing positive words, while the activation of the insula was enhanced when recognizing emotional words, indicating that SD can affect the judgment, decision making, and executive ability, and is closely related to the dorsolateral frontal cortex and insula in the brain. In conclusion, rs-fMRI is an important brain imaging technique for the study of cognitive dysfunction in SD patients. \n\nThe application of acupuncture can improve sleep quality, reduce the occurrence of adverse events related to sleep disorders, and alleviate the negative effects of SD on cognitive function, which is safe and effective. Previous studies have reported that acupuncture San Yin Jiao Point (SP6)  can improve the activity intensity of the default network, precuneus anterior lobe, cingulate gyrus, and other brain regions, and strengthen the interaction between the frontal lobe and temporal lobe, and the connection of synchronous neural network, indicating that acupuncture of SP6 has a strong ability of integration and regulation of mental intelligence, emotion regulation, and brain cognitive dysfunction. \n\nIn recent years, relevant researches on exploring the mechanism of acupuncture for SD comorbid with cognitive decline on rs-fMRI have been reported, but there has been no systematic review and meta-analysis. This study will integrate all the latest relevant literature in this field to explore the effects of acupuncture on the brain activity of patients with SD and cognitive dysfunction. However, due to the lack of relevant clinical research literature, correlation analysis such as subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis may not be possible. In addition, heterogeneity may exist between studies due to the use of different evaluation criteria and intervention methods. In conclusion, the purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide an evidence-based medical basis for clarifying the central nervous system mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of SD comorbid with cognitive dysfunction. \n\n\n## Acknowledgment \n  \nWe appreciate the financial support received from the Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province (No. YDZJ202101ZYTS103) \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \n Conceptualization:   Xiaole Guo. \n\n Data curation:   Ying Wang, Qi Lu. \n\n Formal analysis:   Weiwan Yang, Shiqi Ma. \n\n Funding acquisition:   Hongfeng Wang. \n\n Investigation:   Xiaole Guo, Weiwan Yang. \n\n Supervision:   Hongfeng Wang. \n\n Validation:   Ying Wang, Shiqi Ma. \n\n Writing \u2013 original draft:   Xiaole Guo. \n\n Writing \u2013 review & editing:   Xiaole Guo, Hongfeng Wang. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10082247, "text_md5": "51bc402335a89ddc8af3222ecc00d3a5", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 87], "journal": [88, 108], "publication_year": [110, 114], "title": [125, 278], "keywords": [292, 375], "abstract": [388, 1873], "body": [1882, 19213]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 37026925, "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000033490", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10082247", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10082247"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10082247\">10082247</a>", "list_title": "PMC10082247  Study on acupuncture improving sleep deprivation comorbid with cognitive dysfunction based on rs-fMRI: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis"}
