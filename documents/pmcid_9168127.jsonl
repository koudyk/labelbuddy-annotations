Studying the changes in anatomical, cellular, and molecular levels involved may help to understand the pathogenesis and develop target treatments, not just medical, but also surgical, cell and gene therapy, etc., for individuals with DS. Here we aim to identify key neurodevelopmental manifestations, locate knowledge gaps, and try to build molecular networks to better understand the mechanisms and clinical importance. We summarize current information about the neuropathology and neurodegeneration of the brain from conception to adulthood of foetuses and individuals with DS at anatomical, cellular, and molecular levels in humans. Understanding the alterations and characteristics of developing Down syndrome will help target treatment to improve the clinical outcomes. Early targeted intervention/therapy for the manifestations associated with DS in either the prenatal or postnatal period may be useful to rescue the neuropathology and neurodegeneration in DS. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \n### Neuropathology and Neurodegeneration in Down Syndrome \n  \nDown syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by a third copy of chromosome 21 (Chr21) instead of the original two ( ). This extra Chr21 gives rise to many congenital abnormalities of DS during prenatal and postnatal development ( ). Many affected infants develop various extents of clinical manifestations like infantile spasms, epileptic seizures, intellectual disability, and precocious dementia ( ). Nowadays, the life expectancy of individuals with DS is increasing more than ever due to the vast advancement of more sophisticated scientific technology and medical procedures. Individuals with DS live healthier and longer, but with an intellectual disability. Intellectual disability (ID) is a common neurological deficit in DS; almost all individuals with DS have mild to moderate ID ( ). Any disruption during the development of the nervous system refers to neuropathogenesis. Until now, the underlying cause of the ID in DS was not clearly known; it may be due to altered anatomical structure, cellular functions, and molecular pathways resulting in dysfunction of higher brain functions ( ;  ). Previous research has been conducted more on animal models of DS than on individuals with DS, and also more on the postnatal brain than on the prenatal brain. The observations made in the studies performed in the mouse models of DS may not be comparable and replicable in humans. In addition, individuals with DS are prone to developing an early onset of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s disease (precocious dementia). Dementia is a gradual loss of cognitive functions (learning, thinking, attention, decision making, and problem-solving) ( ) that hampers daily life. These neuropathological changes in the brains of individuals with DS may start from the early developmental stage, as trisomy 21 is the result of chromosomal nondisjunction during meiosis, before fertilization ( ). \n\nHuman brain development occurs in the 3rd week of pregnancy and is morphologically completed at birth as an immature form of the adult brain, though neurogenesis carries on up to adulthood ( ;  ). The early postnatal period is also a valuable time for brain development. Interactions of basic physical, social, emotional, intellectual, language, and self-helping skills generate the infrastructure for future neuro-social development ( ;  ). Manifestations in the early developmental stage are important in recognizing the underlying neuropathological mechanisms responsible for the DS phenotypes. Here we described the neuropathogenesis of the human brain from conception to adulthood of individuals with DS at anatomical, cellular, and molecular levels, finding gaps in the field, building molecular networks within the genes of chromosome 21 and also between non-chromosome 21 and chromosome 21 genes for better understanding the mechanism and clinical importance of this analysis/review. Studying the changes in anatomical, cellular, and molecular levels involved may help to understand the pathogenesis and develop target treatments, not just medical, but also surgical, cell and gene therapy, etc., for individuals with DS. In this review, we summarized only human data. A review of animal data for neuropathogenesis in DS has been published in another review already ( ). \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Sources and Criteria \n  \nWe performed our literature search through interrogation of citations from PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for the past 30 years. The keywords included Down syndrome, brain development, neuropathology, neurodegeneration, and human. Additional potential papers were searched from the reference lists of the searched papers. GeneCards and NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) were used for gene information. All published literature of cohort studies for prenatal and postnatal DS in brain development and pathological studies were included. We selected papers that included their participants confirmed as trisomy 21 and used human brain tissues or cells regardless of imaging, autopsy, or histopathology for their study specimen. Animal studies, cell line studies, and specimens other than brain tissues or cells were excluded. Debate and commentary papers, imaging and laboratory studies for screening and review papers were also excluded from our review. \n\n\n### Data Extraction and Synthesis \n  \nInitially, we identified 1,568 (164 embryonic brain, 419 foetal brain, and 985 postnatal brain development in DS) articles for anatomical and cellular studies, and 615 (509 Chr21 & 106 non-Chr21) articles for our molecular studies from the literature search. At the end, 16 eligible anatomical and cellular studies were selected and 17 (Chr21) and 7 (non-Chr21) eligible molecular studies were included for data extraction. Demographic data (including developmental age/age at necropsy), controls, sample size, brain parts, outcomes measures (including markers and methods), and results (anatomical, cellular, and molecular changes in the whole brain and different parts of the brain) from the selected articles were collected. We recorded both positive and negative results, fold changes of gene intensity, mean and standard deviation (SD), or percentage of the incidence, and   p   values of the outcomes. \n\n\n\n## Brain Development at the Anatomical Level \n  \nThe human brain is a complex organ made up of well-organized segments that perform jointly to control the functions of the body and to regulate the higher functions of the mind that make us human ( ;  ). The development of the human brain starts as a neural groove from a distinct part of the ectoderm, the neuroectoderm, and forms a neural tube after the end of the 3rd week of gestation ( ;  ;  ). The primary and secondary brain vesicles appear through progressive production of neural tissue from the neural tube around the 4  and 5  weeks of gestation, respectively ( ;  ). The brain ventricles create cerebrospinal fluid, which regulates the brain\u2019s interstitial fluid homeostasis and acts as a hydromechanical protector of the central nervous system ( ). \n\n### Cerebrum \n  \nCerebral hemispheres appear around the end of the 5  week of gestation from lateral expansions of the telencephalon ( ;  ). The brain cortex, composed of more than 100 billion neurons, develops from the 6th week of gestation and ends at birth ( ). There is a positive relationship between total brain volume (TBV) and intelligence quotient (IQ) ( ). In 2 to 6-month-old infants with DS, brain weight decreases about 1.2-folds less than in similar-aged normal infants ( ). Total intracranial volume (TIV) was reduced 1.1-folds less in children and adolescents with DS (7\u201316 years old) than in similar aged normal controls ( ). TBV decreased 1.2-folds, total grey mater volume 1.2-folds, and total white mater volume 1.3-folds in 5\u201323 years old individuals with DS ( ). Reduction of cerebral cortex (1.1-folds) and white mater (1.2-folds) volume was seen in 30\u201345 years old individuals with DS ( ). TBV & GM also decreased 1.3 & 1.4-folds in individuals with DS over 40 years old compared to normal controls ( ). This suggests that brain volume reduction in DS is consistent with the aging process related to the early onset of dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease in later life. \n\nSulci and gyri start to develop at the 8  week of gestation and continue till birth. Sulci and gyri increase the surface area of the brain and, therefore, increase behavioral and intellectual ability ( ;  ). While cortical thickness is negatively related to general intelligence in children and adolescents (9\u201316\u00a0years), it is positively related in younger adults (16\u201324\u00a0years) ( ) (  and  ). Cortical thickness increases 1.1-folds and total surface area decreases 1.1-folds in 5\u201324 years old individuals with DS ( ). Superior temporal gyrus reduces 1.2-folds in 5\u201323 years old individuals with DS than in aged-matched controls ( ). This suggests that the brains of individuals with DS are comparatively smaller and with fewer superficial sulci and gyri than in normal individuals, resulting in a \u2018Lissencephalic\u2019 or smooth brain surface and contributing to general cognitive and developmental deficits ( ) (  and  ). \n  \nAnatomical changes in human Down syndrome brains.   (A)   Time line of major brain structures during development in normal (color boxes) and Down syndrome (DS, color arrows).   (B)   Fold changes of various brain structure volumes or sizes in DS vs. normal controls. Mean change data is extracted from available literature as shown in  . NB = normal brain; DS = Down syndrome; \u2191 = increase; \u2193 = decrease; GW = gestational week; GM = Gray matter; WM = White matter; TBV = total brain volume; TIV = total intracranial volume; LVA = lateral ventricular area; CPA = choroid plexus area; CSF = cerebrospinal fluid; C = cerebral; Cb = cerebellar. \n    \nSummary of neuropathogenesis at anatomical, cellular, and molecular levels in human. \n    \nThe hippocampus functions as the consolidation of long-term memories from short-term memories ( ;  ). While there were no differences in the hippocampus in 2\u20133\u00a0years children ( ), in both 7\u201316\u00a0years children and adolescents and 23\u201351\u00a0years adults with DS, the hippocampus was significantly reduced 1.2-folds ( ;  ) when compared with controls. Hippocampal area also decreased 1.8-folds in over 40 years old individuals with DS ( ). This suggests that the reduction of the hippocampus starts in childhood and continues throughout life. Hippocampus hypoplasia may interrupt neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, which may affect the functional capacity and causative issues of ID in DS ( ;  ;  ) (  and  ). \n\n\n### Cerebellum \n  \nThe cerebellum starts to develop at 6th weeks of gestation, and primitive cerebellar hemispheres appear at 7\u20139\u00a0weeks of gestation after progressive proliferation of the rhombic lip ( ;  ). Fissures and lobules of the cerebellum start to form at 10\u201311\u00a0weeks of gestation and continue till birth ( ). Cerebellar volume was reduced 1.3-folds in foetuses with DS at 15\u201338\u00a0weeks of gestation ( ) and 1.5 folds in 5\u201323 year old individuals with DS ( ). Around 20\u00a0weeks of gestation, white matter (WM) & grey matter (GM) volume in cerebellum reduces 1.4-folds in foetuses with DS ( ). GM volume decreases 2.2-folds and WM volume decreases 1.2-folds in 2\u20133 years old children with DS and significantly decreases in 7\u201316\u00a0years children and adolescents with DS ( ;  ). Reduction of grey and white matter volume may cause a decrease in neuron number, relating to neurodevelopmental delay and dementia ( ;  ). At 17\u201321\u00a0weeks of gestation in foetuses with DS, the four major fissures (sulci) dividing the cerebellum into five lobes are clearly identifiable near midline of the cerebral vermis in both normal and foetuses with DS, but the fissures gradually become less noticeable in the lateral direction and the lobes become smaller, even invisible ( ). The length of the cerebellar fissures, important for dividing the brain into lobes, and the size of the lobules (gyri), are both significantly reduced in foetuses with DS. The fissure length is 1.2-folds smaller, and the lobule size is 1.4-folds smaller ( ;  ). Fissure length decreases in DS may be responsible for smaller lobes and brain regions ( ). These suggest that hypoplasia of the cerebellum in individuals with DS starts in the 2  trimester of pregnancy and continue through childhood and adulthood, attributing the characteristics of hypotonic and motor coordination abnormalities ( ) (  and  ) \n\n\n### Brainstem \n  \nThe brain stem develops from the caudal primitive neural tube by the rapid production of specific nuclei of basal and alar plates between the 4th and 12th weeks of gestation ( ;  ). There is significant volumetric reduction of the brainstem (about 1.1 folds), thallamus (1.1-folds) and caudate nucleus (1.14-folds) in children with DS (2\u20133 years old) ( ). Brainstem volume decreases significantly in 7\u201316\u00a0year old children and adolescents with DS ( ) and 1.1-folds in 30\u201345 year old individuals with DS, but that was not statistically significant ( ). The area of the pons, midbrain, medulla oblongata, and whole brainstem decreases 1.9-folds, 1.3-folds, 1.1-folds, and 1.4-folds, respectively. in children with DS of 2\u00a0days\u201311\u00a0years ( ). The brainstem volume reduction may affect the structural connectivity between the brain stem and the cerebrum and cerebellum, which may be responsible for the neurodevelopmental delay in individuals with DS  (  and  ). \n\n\n### Ventricles \n  \nBrain ventricles derive from the cavity of the neural tube at the end of the 3rd week of pregnancy ( ). The choroid plexus is formed by the tortuous ependymal cells together with vessels and connective tissue and starts to produce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the end of the 1st trimester ( ). In the normal foetus in the first trimester of pregnancy, an increase in the size of the lateral cerebral ventricles has been seen at 11\u201313\u00a0weeks of gestation, but its area significantly decreases by 1.9-folds in foetuses with DS ( ). It may be due to abnormal development of the ventricular system and choroid plexus, plus reduction of brain volume. However, at 30 weeks of gestation, lateral and fourth ventricular size increased in foetuses with DS ( ). Similarly, cerebral ventricular hypertrophy has been observed in adults with DS at 30\u201345 and over 40\u00a0years old, with ventricles increased around 1.3 and 3.9-fold ( ;  ). This may be associated with the decrease in white and grey matter volume and brain volume in individuals with DS ( ). In addition, alterations in ventricular size may affect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) formation, which may interrupt the brain\u2019s interstitial fluid homeostasis ( ). CSF decreases 1.1-folds in 5\u201324 years old individuals with DS ( ) (  and  ). \n\n\n\n## Summary and Knowledge Gaps \n  \nThe \u2018Lissencephalic\u2019 or smooth brain surface, brain volume and weight reduction are consistent with the aging process (2nd trimester to 45 years old), related to general cognitive and developmental deficits, and the early onset of dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease in later life, respectively, in DS. Hippocampus hypoplasia (starts in childhood and continues throughout life) and hypoplasia of the cerebellum (2nd trimester of pregnancy and continues through childhood and adulthood) may affect the functional capacity and causative issues of ID, and the characteristics of hypotonic and motor coordination abnormalities respectively in DS. The structural connectivity between the brain stem and the cerebrum and cerebellum was derailed due to the brainstem volume reduction, and the reduction of grey and white matter volume may be responsible for the neurodevelopmental delay in individuals with DS  .   However, there has been no study in DS so far on the human embryonic brain development (beginning around the 3rd gestational week) due to a lack of sensitive and diagnostic testing in the embryonic period. Studies were done mostly in the second trimester of pregnancy and in the childhood, adolescent, and adult stages of life. Most specimens were mainly from the cerebrum and cerebellum. Remarkably, there is no information on brain development with DS, such as neural groove, neural tube, or brain vesicles. It is difficult to say whether neuropathology in DS starts at this early stage, which derails the formation of well-organized brain segments (forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain) and may hamper normal brain development and functioning, causing the neurodevelopmental delay in DS. \n\n\n## Brain Development at the Cellular Level \n  \nThe infrastructural alterations at the cellular level before birth are a reflection of the modifications in the gross anatomy of the foetal brain ( ). The neural tube is lined by a single layer of pseudostratified epithelium, which proliferates quickly into neuroepithelial cells, collectively named neuroepithelium or the ventricular zone (VZ). All neurons and glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells) are derived from the stem cells in the VZ during brain development ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The marginal zone (MZ) and intermediate zone (IZ) show up soon after the development of the VZ from subsequent division of the neuroepithelial cells in the VZ at 4th weeks of the gestation ( ;  ). These 3 neuroepithelial zones are the basic cellular platform for developing the central nervous system (CNS). The subventricular zone (SVZ) generates the macroglial cells from the fusion of the VZ and IZ ( ). Cortical neurogenesis starts from the VZ at 5\u20136\u00a0weeks of gestation, peaks at 15\u201316\u00a0weeks, and ends at the 24th week of gestation ( ;  ). Mature neurons develop by the subsequent division of the primary neuroblasts at the 6th week of gestation ( ;  ). After finishing their last cell division at 12\u201313\u00a0weeks, mature neurons start to migrate via radial glia from their origin to destination, which ends at 26\u201329\u00a0weeks of gestation ( ;  ;  ;  ). Synapses develop at 18\u201322\u00a0weeks of gestation and throughout life ( ;  ;  ) ( ). Neuronal apoptosis is a naturally occurring death process of neurons that eradicates cells to maintain the balance of the neuronal cell population. It begins at around the 7th week of gestation and continues throughout life ( ;  ;  ;  ) ( ). \n  \nCellular changes in human Down syndrome brains.   (A)   Time line of major brain cells during development in normal (colour boxes) and Down syndrome (DS, color arrows).   (B)   Fold changes of various brain cell numbers or densities in DS compared with normal controls. Mean change data is extracted from available literature as shown in  . NB = normal brain; DS = Down syndrome; \u2191 = increase; \u2193 = decrease; GW = gestational week; EGL = external granular layers; IGL = internal granular layers; CP = cortical plate; SP = subplate; AP = alar plate; BP = basal plate. \n  \nThe individual developmental events of the CNS are specific to different regions, which are structurally as well as functionally different from each other ( ;  ). The neural tube modifies its basic cellular platform to accommodate the development of the different brain regions. For the cerebral cortex, the modification is from the emergence of the cortical plate (CP) and the subplate (SP) between the IZ and MZ at 8th\u20139th weeks of gestation ( ). For the cerebellar cortex, modification is due to the presence of alar plate derivatives within the MZ at 10th\u201311th weeks of gestation. For the brainstem, the posterior and anterior portions of the VZ and IZ modifies into alar cell column or alar plate and basal cell column or basal plate, respectively at the end of 4  weeks of gestation ( ;  ) ( ). \n\n### Cerebrum \n  \nThe cerebral cortex originates from the CP and the SP contains immature neurons that emerge from the VZ. Neuroblasts undergo consecutive proliferation and give rise to mature neurons. Cajal-Retzius cells (CR) arise from the MZ at 5\u20138\u00a0weeks of gestation ( ), which regulate the direction and location of the migrating neurons into the appropriate layers of the neocortex ( ). Then mature neurons start to migrate from the proliferative region of the VZ in an orderly manner through the formation of six neuronal layers in the neocortex. The layer-I is the outermost layer near the pial surface that develops from the MZ. The CP generates layer-II to layer-VI, whereas the SP and IZ give rise to subcortical white matter. After reaching their destination in the cortical layers, the neurons start to generate neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors and widen their processes for communicating with other neuronal cells ( ;  ;  ). SP acts as a transit for the afferent fibers and premature synapses. They appear in the SP first prior to establishing ultimate connections in the CP ( ). The MZ and SP contribute an essential part in the establishment of the cortex but are short-lived brain layers and vanish before birth ( ). \n\nA research study was conducted from 14 weeks of gestation to new-born in the population with DS and a similar-aged normal population on the glial cells of the cerebral cortex and hippocampal region. They identified fewer neuron numbers and disruption in myelination in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal regions in the population with DS ( ). Astrocytes are increased 3-folds at 14\u201316\u00a0weeks but decreased 1.3-fold at 16\u201328\u00a0weeks, and then again increased 1.2-fold at 28 weeks onward, up to new-born. Oligodendrocytes are decreased 1.4-fold at 14\u201316\u00a0weeks but increased 1.1-fold at 16\u201328\u00a0weeks and 1.3-fold at 28\u00a0weeks onward up to new-born, microglia are increased 1.3-fold at 16\u201328\u00a0weeks and 1.7-fold at 28\u00a0weeks onward up to new-born, and macrophages are decreased 2-fold at 14\u201316\u00a0weeks and 1.1-fold at 16\u201328\u00a0weeks and increased 2.4-fold at 28\u00a0weeks onward up to new-born in DS group. Astrocytes have an important role in neuronal development, durability, and metabolic function. Altered astrocyte production may cause defective neurogenesis and decreased neuron numbers. Disruption of oligodendrocyte production may involve abnormal proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors, resulting in delayed myelination. Abnormal phagocytic macrophage activity may hamper neurogenesis and apoptosis. All these abnormalities in the early stage of brain development in DS may be the leading cause of ID in individuals with DS ( ). Interlaminar glial palisade (IGP) is a kind of astroglial cells in supragranular layers that has short unbranched processes (intralaminal astrocytic process) at 20\u201340\u00a0days postnatal period and long branched radial processes (interlaminal astrocytic processes) by the 2nd month of life, which involve in the functional organization of the supragranular layers and related to cortico\u2013cortical pathways. Before 10 days old after birth, IGP has a similar distribution in both DS and normal control, but infants with DS at 16\u201328 days old have a 1.7-fold shorter branching IGP than normal control. Astroglial cells also decrease from 3\u00a0months to 69 years old in individuals with DS. This may suggest that there are alterations of IGP (interlaminal astrocytic processes) in supragranular layers in individuals with DS during early infancy, which may be related to the initial patches (amyloid beta plaques) formation for the development of Alzheimer\u2019s type dementia (AtD) in individuals with DS ( ;  ) (  and  ). \n\n\n### Cerebellum \n  \nThe development of the cerebellar cortex is somehow different from the development of the cerebral cortex. It is due to the changes in the basic cellular platform of the neural tube to accommodate the development of the cerebellar cortex by the appearance of an external germinal or granular layer in the MZ at 10\u201311\u00a0weeks of gestation ( ;  ). A huge reduction of the total cell population in the developing cerebellar cortex of foetuses with DS was reported; cerebellar granule cells in the external granular layer were reduced 1.3-folds in 17\u201321\u00a0weeks old foetuses with DS. Whereas in the internal granular layer, the cerebellar granule cell reduction was 1.8-folds ( ;  ). These findings suggest that there is severe deterioration of granule cell proliferation in the developing cerebellum, which may be associated with cerebellar hypotrophy and cerebellar dysfunction in children and adult individuals with DS, causing dysregulation of motor control and association with Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome (CCAS), characterized by cognitive deficiency ( ) (  and  ). \n\n\n### Brainstem \n  \nFor development of the brainstem, the neural tube alters the anterior and posterior portions of the VZ and IZ into the basal plate and alar plate, respectively, at the end of the 4  week of gestation. The motor cranial nerve nuclei originate from the basal cell column, whereas the sensory-motor nerve nuclei originate from the alar cell column ( ). However, there was no study found in DS about the brainstem development at a cellular level in humans ( ). \n\n\n### Ventricles \n  \nVentricles of the brain are initially lined by a single layer of the pseudostratified epithelium of the ventricular zone and later by a simple cuboidal epithelium, the ependyma ( ). From the 17th-21st gestational weeks, the ventricular zone (of the parahippocampal region that surrounds enclosed the tip of the ventricle) has neurogenesis impairment in foetuses with DS. The total number of granule cells decreased 1.9-folds in the foetuses with DS ( ). This suggests that foetuses with DS have fewer proliferating cells in the ventricular zone, which may hamper mature neuron production and migration to the neocortex (  and  ). \n\n\n\n## Summary and Knowledge Gaps \n  \nDefective neurogenesis, delayed myelination, and apoptosis are caused by altered astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and macrophages during the 2nd trimester of pregnancy and the neonatal period with DS, which are the leading causes of ID in people with DS. Alterations of IGP in supragranular layers during early infancy with DS may be related to the development of early onset dementia in individuals with DS. Deterioration of granule cell proliferation in the developing cerebellum in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy with DS may cause cerebellar hypotrophy and cerebellar dysfunction, which may be responsible for dysregulation of motor control and association with Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome (CCAS), characterized by cognitive deficiency in children and adult individuals with DS. So far, no cellular study has been found for DS in humans at the early embryonic stage and no study for brainstem development. So, there is a lack of information about DS neuropathogenesis at this critical neurodevelopmental stage. The basic cellular platform plan of the modification of the neural tube for the different regions of brain development in DS is also unknown. Therefore, it is not clear whether there are any alterations at this stage of development in the DS, which may influence the neurogenesis causing ID and cognitive deficiency in children and adult of individuals with DS. \n\n\n## Brain Development at the Molecular Level \n  \nThe proliferation and differentiation of the neuroepithelial cells into neurons and glial cells during the early embryonic period is the outcome of complex molecular signaling regulated by multiple gene products (proteins). Molecular signals originate from the neural groove (primitive node) and transmit from one to another consecutively, controlled by the expression of genes in the cells ( ;  ). Deviation of these signals may be attributed to abnormal neural functions in DS during development. \n\n### Genes of Chromosome 21 Related to the Brain With Down Syndrome \n  \nThe triplication of chromosome 21 (Chr21) is the culprit of DS. According to the Human Genome Project (HGP), there are 22,000\u201325,000 genes in the human genome. Chr21 is the 2nd chromosome that has been completely sequenced after Chr22 ( ;  ;  ). By that time in 2000, the sequencing of Chr21 disclosed that there were 225 genes and 59 pseudogenes. Among 225 genes, 127 were defined as known genes and 98 as predicted genes ( ). So far 75 more genes have been revealed. Currently, there are 202 known genes and 23 predicted genes in the Chr21. Among all, 44 genes are linked to DS disorders, whilst 158 genes are not yet linked to DS disorders according to \u201cGeneCards\u201d ( ) and \u2018NCBI\u2019 ( ). Out of 44 DS linked genes, 35 genes were associated with DS brain disorders and 9 genes with other DS disorders, whereas out of 158 unlinked genes, 28 genes were associated with brain disorders and 130 genes with other disorders. Surprisingly, only 21 genes (10.40%) of Chr21 were studied in human brains with DS. These studied 21 genes are DYRK1A, S100B, OLIG2, C21orf5/DOPEY2, DSCAM, SYNJ1, ITSN1, GATD3A, SOD1, ERG, APP, BACE2, DSCR1/RCAN1, DSCR5, RIPPLY3/DSCR6, SIM2, DNMT3L, PKNOX1, DSCR4, KNCJ6/GIKR2, and RUNX1. That means not all genes that are linked with brain disorders have been studied in human brains with DS yet ( ). \n  \nDistribution of brain development genes in human chromosomes.   (A)   Studied and not yet studied brain development genes in normal and brain with DS in Chromosome 21 (Chr21).   (B)   Studied brain development genes in other chromosomes in the brain with DS. \n  \n\n### Functional Correlation of Chromosome 21 Genes in the Brain With Down Syndrome \n  \nResearchers and scientists continuously make efforts to understand the mechanism of ID in DS in order to identify any potential therapeutic targets to treat the condition. Some research studies have been conducted from several gestational weeks to older adults with DS and compared with age-matched normal controls ( ). \n\nFor neurogenesis, DYRK1A is involved in brain growth and development by regulating neurogenesis, neural plasticity, and survival. Phosphorylation regulates the polarization and depolarization of actin filaments as well as aggregation of the DYRK1A-actin complexes ( ;  ;  ). DYRK1A expression increased 1.9-folds, 3.5-folds, and 3.2-folds in new-borns, infants, and adults\u2019 frontal cortex with DS on the actin cytoskeleton protein when compared with normal controls. Derangement of DYRK1A-actin aggregation was found in newborns and infants with DS, suggesting that increased DYRK1A expression was related to the abnormal neuronal growth and defective neuronal circuits in brain development by reducing the actin cytoskeleton in the brain with DS, which may be associated with the ID of individuals with DS ( ). S100B is associated with neuron differentiation, neurite extension, astrocytosis, and axonal proliferation ( ;  ). S100\u03b2  astrocytes increased 1.7-fold at 17\u201335 weeks of gestation, 2-fold at 8 months to 9 years old and 1.9-fold at 22\u201368 years old with DS. The S100\u03b2  astrocytes increase the intraneuronal free calcium level and stimulate the formation of abnormally prominent and tortuous processes in the neurons of DS, which may be the cause of the ID in DS ( ). OLIG2 is essential for the development of oligodendrocyte and somatic motor neurons in the hindbrain and spinal cord ( ). Potassium channel KCNA3 is involved in the oligo-progenitor differentiation and proliferation changes ( ;  ) and OLIG2 controls the KCNA3 channel expression level ( ). Overexpression of the OLIG2 (2.7-folds) diminishes the potassium channel (1.7-folds) activity, causing a reduction of oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation in foetuses with DS (14\u201318\u00a0weeks), which may be the reason for smaller hindbrain size, developmental delay, and ID in DS by inhibiting neuronal proliferation and resulting in neuronal reduction and hypomyelination ( ) (  and  ). \n  \nMolecular changes in human Down syndrome brains.   (A)   Time line of studied brain development genes during development in chromosome 21 (Chr21, upper panel) and other chromosomes (non-Chr21, lower panel) in brains with DS. +/- = increase/decrease expression levels compared to normal control brains.   (B)   Fold changes of studied brain development gene expression in Chr21 & non-Chr21 in brains with DS. Mean change data is extracted from available literature as shown in  . \n  \nFor neuronal growth, C21orf5/DOPEY2 is involved in selective transcriptional activity and regional and cellular specificity of gene transcripts in early development ( ). The differential expression of C21orf5 is restricted to the foetal cerebral (lower intensity), hippocampal (lower intensity) and cerebellar (highest intensity) regions, which are associated with learning and memory processes through neuronal proliferation and distribution, dendritic arborization and myelination ( ). In the foetal (22\u201324\u00a0week) cerebral cortex with DS, cerebellum, and hippocampus, C21orf5 is differentially overexpressed by 1.8-folds, 1.9-folds, and 2.1-folds, respectively ( ). C21orf5 overexpression in those regions of the developing brain with DS may suggest a potential role in the mechanism of ID in DS by alteration of dendritic densities, retardation, and disorganization of cortical lamination and slow myelination. DSCAM has a role in nervous system development, including axon guidance and segregation, dendritic patterning, and synapse formation ( ). DSCAM was detected in both the brain with DS and the normal brain at 40\u00a0GW in the cerebral and cerebellar white matter, expression level was increased thereafter with advancing age. But it was increased more during childhood and adulthood of brains with DS. DSCAM was also detected in the dystrophic neurites of the senile plaques in the cerebral cortex of adults with DS ( ;  ). This suggests that DSCAM overexpression may be involved in abnormal neuronal projections and axonal plasma membrane (myelin-sheath) formation, causing delayed myelination and disruption of neural circuit that may be associated with the development of the ID in DS, and may also take part in the early onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease by disrupting axonogenesis and synaptogenesis, and senile plaque formation ( ;  ). SYNJ1 and ITSN1 play a role in clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis, recycling, and transmission and perhaps may be associated with cell signaling ( ;  ;  ;  ). Synaptojanin increased 1.5-fold in 15\u201316 weeks old foetuses with DS than in control foetuses during the peak period of neuronal migration ( ). ITSN1 expression level increased in foetal (18\u201322\u00a0weeks) brains with DS ( ). It was increased by 1.8-folds in DS (5\u00a0months\u201362\u00a0years) when compared with controls (6\u00a0months\u201367\u00a0years) frontal cortex ( ). Synaptojanin and ITSN1 overactivity, associated with neuronal loss, atrophic basilar dendrites, and atypical synaptic density, disrupt neuronal migration and synaptic transmission in the developing brain with DS by defective endocytic processes, elevating Ras activation and increasing neuronal receptor trafficking and neurodegeneration ( ;  ), which may disrupt normal brain functioning and cause the development of ID in DS. SYNJ1 also increased 1.4-folds in individuals with DS vs. young control, 2.5-folds in DS developed AD (DSAD) vs. old control, and 4.9-folds in DSAD vs. AD patients ( ). The overall high SYNJ1 levels in DS may be related to abnormal synaptic vesicle formation or synaptic loss, leading to neurodegeneration in patients with DS (  and  ). \n\nFor neuron damage, GATD3A/ES1 encodes a mitochondrial protein, which is a member of the DJ-1/Pfpl gene family relating to basic mitochondrial functioning ( ). GATD3A was overexpressed by 1.9-folds in the foetal brain with DS when compared with control ( ). This result suggests that overexpression of GATD3A may be associated with the ROS related neuron apoptosis and neurodegeneration in the foetuses with DS, causing ID in DS ( ;  ). SOD1 detoxifies the free toxic superoxide radicals to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide and protects the neurons from oxidative injury ( ;  ). Overexpression of SOD1 was seen in cerebral cortex with DS (over 50\u00a0years) by 1.4-folds ( ,) whereas in foetal brains with DS it was not overexpressed ( ). This higher level of SOD1 may give rise to an abnormally high hydrogen peroxide level in the neurons. This could result in free radical damage to the nerve cell membrane and may relate to ID in DS ( ). ERG may be involved in transcriptional regulation of genes important for embryonic development, cell proliferation and differentiation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis ( ;  ;  ). ERG was overexpressed by 3.6-folds in cerebral cortex with DS (>50\u00a0years) ( ). Overactivity may be related to apoptotic neuronal death and neurodegeneration, causing cognitive failure and dementia in DS. APP also plays a role in neuronal and axonal growth ( ). BACE2 encodes a glycoprotein that splits APP into A\u03b2P, which promotes the amyloid plaque formation in AD and the brain with DS causing dementia ( ;  ). APP is overexpressed by 3.4-fold in the adult (>50\u00a0years) brain with DS while it is comparable in the fetal (18\u201319\u00a0weeks) brain with DS ( ). BACE2 is present in the neurons of the neurofibrillary tangles of brains with DS (49\u201360 years) with dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type (DAT), but not in those without DAT (27 gestational week (GW) to 32\u00a0years) ( ). This suggests that in the fetal stage, APP and BACE2 were not exacerbated, and overexpression of APP and BACE2 in adults with DS promotes accumulation of A\u03b2P and participates in neurodegeneration ( ;  ) (  and  ). \n\nA region of the long arm of Chr21 (21q22) containing most of the genes, known as the Down syndrome critical region (DSCR), is supposedly responsible for the development of the DS phenotypes ( ;  ). DSCR1/RCAN1 inhibits the calcineurin dependent signaling pathway by interacting with calcineurin A and may play a role in CNS development ( ;  ). RCAN1 was overexpressed by 1.3-folds (over 23\u00a0years) and 1.4-folds (over 50\u00a0years) in the adult brain with DS than in controls, and this chronic elevation of expression may be involved in the formation of NFTs (neurofibrilary tangles) in DS, like in AD ( ;  ). The DSCR4 gene is involved in the development of DS ( ). The gene encodes an enzyme that activates the first reaction of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis ( ). DSCR6/RIPPLY3 gene functions as a transcriptional repressor and takes part in the development of pharyngeal apparatus and derivatives ( ). The expression levels of DSCR5 and DSCR6 were increased by 4-folds and 1.8-folds in foetuses with DS when compared with the normal controls. No immunoreactive band was observed for DSCR4 in the fetal cortex with DS. This suggests that all gene products from the DSCR are up-regulated as anticipated by the gene dosage hypothesis ( ). The KCNJ6/GIRK2 gene modulates the circuit activity in the neuronal cell and the heart rate in cardiac cells through G-protein coupled receptor stimulation ( ). KCNJ6 was decreased by 2.5-folds, but the result was not significant in foetuses with DS when compared with the normal controls ( ). RUNX1 regulates the transcription of target genes and is important for the development of normal hematopoiesis ( ). In the frontal cortex with DS, RUNX1 was overexpressed by 1.3-folds when compared with age-matched (over 50 years) controls, but the result was not statistically significant ( ) (  and  ). \n\n\n### Genes of Non-Chr21 Related to the Brain With Down Syndrome \n  \nResearch studies have found the involvement of some non-Chr21 genes in neuropathogenesis in DS through trans-acting reactions. There were 13,695 disease genes recorded in \u201cGeneCards\u201d ( ) and \u201cNCBI\u201d ( ). Currently, only 16 non-Chr21 genes have been linked to DS in \u201cGeneCards ( ) and NCBI\u201d ( ). Among those, 12 genes were studied in humans with DS disorders: 8 genes for brain disorders with DS 2 for heart disorders with DS, and 2 for leukemia with DS. These 8 genes are APOE (19q13.32), BACE1 (11q23.3), FABP7 (6q22-23), IL1B (2q14.1), GSAP (7q11.23), SERPINA3 (14q32.13), UBB (17p11.2), and IRS1 (2q36.3) ( ). \n\n\n### Functional Correlation of Non-Chr21 Genes in the Brain With Down Syndrome \n  \nFor neuron damage, IL1B/IL1 encodes a protein of interleukin 1 cytokine family member origin from activated macrophages ( ;  ). IL1 is generated by glial cells and stimulates gliosis ( ;  ). In the temporal lobe, IL1 immunoreactive cells increased 1.9-folds and 3.01-folds in 2 days old and 3 months old with DS when compared with neonates without DS. This suggests that IL1B overexpression escalated the proliferation and activity of the astroglial cell and may be associated with the ID of DS by astrogliosis ( ) (  and  ). \n\nFor AD, APOE is involved in lipoprotein-mediated lipid transport into the organs, especially in the brain ( ;  ). APOE, generated by the astrocytes, has an essential role in the formulation and redistribution of lipids for growth and repair at the time of neuro-development and injury. Apo-E is also one of the elements of amyloid deposition. Apo-E in astrocytes is decreased by 4.9 folds in the white matter of 28\u00a0GW to 5 year old individuals with DS and increased by 1.9 folds in the frontal cortex of 7\u00a0months\u201324 year old individuals with DS. This defective and altered production of apo-E-producing astrocytes in the developing stage may point to the early onset of dementia in individuals with DS ( ). GASP activates the A\u03b2 formation ( ), whose expression level is elevated 2.5-folds in the adult frontal cortex with DS, and this overexpression may suggest the accumulation of increased A\u03b2 resulting in AD pathology in DS ( ). UBB encodes ubiquitin, which is involved in regulating gene expression, the maintenance of chromatin structure and the stress response ( ). Ubi-B  is increased by 10.6-folds in the cerebral cortex with DS. No \u03b2APP  was observed in the control brain, whereas, in the brain with DS, \u03b2APP  was observed to be 86% increased ( ). Overexpression of the UBB causes excessive production of Ubi-B protein and may relate to altered neuronal functioning in DS. Excessive \u03b2APP  and Ubi-B  in the neurofibrillary tangles and dystrophic neurites may suggest the relationship between the two proteins and their involvement in causing AD in individuals with DS ( ) (  and  ). IRS1 encodes a protein which is phosphorylated by insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase and mediates the control of various cellular processes by insulin. IRS1 & IR proteins level decreased 1.43-folds & 2-folds, respectively, in the frontal cortex of <40 years old individuals with DS when compared with similar aged controls although the results were not statistically significant. This may interfere with the insulin signaling pathway and impair glucose uptake in the brain with DS, causing the brain to become insulin resistant and hamper the physiological functions of insulin, such as neurite growth, promoting dendritic spine formation, development of excitatory synapses, and promoting neuronal survival by inhibiting apoptosis; leading to the development of neuropathology like AD in young individuals with DS ( ;  ) (  and  ). \n\n\n### Molecular Interaction Between Chromosome 21 and Non-Chr21 Genes \n  \nBased on the molecular network built amongst the genes of Chr21 ( ), groups of genes similar in function are linked together either by metabolic pathways, physical interactions, gene co-expression or by sharing their protein domains involved in the DS phenotypic abnormalities. DYRK1A, DOPEY2, ITSN1, and DSCAM regulate neuronal proliferation and differentiation through the cell signaling pathway. Overexpression of these groups of genes may be responsible for learning and memory deficits. PKNOX1 and DNMT3L activate the transcription factors and epigenetic changes. The DNMT3L gene is essential for the establishment of maternal genomic imprints ( ) and plays a potential role in DS neurodevelopment through gene expression modulation in neurons ( ). The methylation profiles in the neuro progenitors showed significant global hypermethylation in the fetal (18 week) frontal cortex with DS. DNMT3L may play a role in the epigenetic changes of other genes in DS ( ). OLIG2, SIM2, S100B, SOD1, DYRK1A, APP, and GADT3A are involved in axonal proliferation and neurite extension, and overactivity of this group of genes may be responsible for cognitive impairment. The SIM2 gene encodes a transcription factor regulating midline cell fate determination, which is a master regulator of neurogenesis ( ;  ). Differential expressions of SIM2 in the cerebral cortex (weak), hippocampal formation, and cerebellar cortex (strong) in the embryonic and foetal brain suggest the potential roles in the development of the CNS ( ). In the frontal cortex with DS, SIM2 was overexpressed by 1.3-folds when compared with age-matched (over 50\u00a0years) controls, but the result was not statistically significant ( ). Based on the networks, SIM2 seems to be a master gene in regulating other associated genes during brain development. Disruption of SIM2 may contribute to neuropathogenesis in DS in early life ( ,  ,   and  ). \n  \nMolecular networks in human Down syndrome brains.   (A)   Network of studied brain development genes in chromosome 21 (Chr21) in brains with DS.   (B)   Network of studied brain development genes in Chr21 (gene names in black) together with non-chromosome 21 (non-Chr21, gene names in red) in brains with DS Different color circles and lines represent the groups of genes with similar gene functions and interactions in metabolic pathways, physical interactions, gene co-expression or sharing their protein domains. \n    \nNeuropathology in Down syndrome brain in human. Relationship of brain development genes, molecular, cellular, anatomical changes and clinical manifestations for the development of intellectual disability in Down syndrome. Genes in boxes as chromosome 21 genes; genes in circle as non-chromosome 21 genes. Changes in blue lead to defective synaptogenesis and pre- and post-synaptic length and width, thereafter neurodevelopmental delay; green lead to reduced oligodendrocytes and hypo- and de-myelination, thereafter impaired cognitive function and dementia; orange lead to defective astrogilosis and loss of support and nutrition thereafter learning and memory deficits; and purple lead to degenerating neuron, excessive apoptosis and \u03b2-amyloid deposition, thereafter precocious dementia & AD-DS. Arrows \u2191/\u2193 as direction of the gene expression and changes. \n  \nDOPEY2, SYNJ1, SIM2, DSCAM, DYRK1A, ITSN1, and OLIG2 are involved in synaptogenesis, dendritic arborization, and developmental patterning. Overactivity of this group of genes may contribute to developmental delay. APP, BACE2, S100B, GATD3A, DOPEY2, DYRK1A, ITSN1, and SYNJ1 are involved in axonogenesis, A\u03b2P synthesis, neuronal adhesion, and neurite growth, and overexpression of this group of genes may be responsible for precautious dementia and AD-DS. The \u03b2APP  neurons were increased 5-folds in 8\u00a0months\u20139 years old and 12-folds at 22\u201368 years old individuals with DS, which has a significant correlation with the S100\u03b2  astrocyte numbers in DS when compared with the controls. This suggests that overexpression of the S100B gene may interact with APP and participate in the formation of amyloid plaques at the early age of individuals with DS, causing Alzheimer\u2019s like dementia ( ) ( ,  ,   and  ). \n\nWhile non-Chr21 genes are included in the network, non-Chr21 genes disperse the Chr21 genes placement in the network, which may be due to gene interactions, changing metabolic pathway, and transactivation of gene expression ( ). The interactions of Chr21 genes become dissociative within the network and may suggest disturbance between gene molecules in the neural manifestations. Non-Chr21 genes have strong interactions with Chr21 genes, mostly interacting with those, involved in AD like dementia in DS. For example, APOE (non-Chr21), DSCAM, and S100B (Chr21) are involved in axonal proliferation, lipid redistribution, and developmental patterning, and their overexpression may be responsible for cognitive dysfunction. IL1B (non-Chr21) and S100B (Chr21) are involved in astroglial cell proliferation, and activation and interactions may be responsible for abnormally prominent and tortuous neural process formation, causing ID in DS ( ;  ) ( ,  ,   and  ). \n\nUBB (non-Chr21) and DYRK1A, DSCR5, PKNOX1, DSCR4, OLIG2, RIPPLY3, DOPEY2 (Chr21) are involved in maintaining the chromatin structure and regulating stress response, and their interactions may be responsible for developmental delay ( ;  ;  ). PKNOX1 activates homeodomain transcription factors that are involved in embryonic development and organogenesis ( ;  ). PKNOX1 and FABP7 were overexpressed by 1.9 and 1.6-folds in the foetal (18\u201323\u00a0weeks) brain with DS. FABP7 plays an important role in radial glial fiber formation that is essential for the migration of immature neurons to create cortical layers during brain development ( ). Overexpression of FABP7 may result in the functional disturbance of glial cells, hampering neuronal migration and causing neurodegeneration. Luciferase expression increased 3.5-folds through the FABP7 promoter with PKNOX1, and the expression increased 1.4-folds by deleting the FABP7 promoter with PKNOX1. This suggests that the transactivation of the FABP7 (6q22-23) gene promoter is due to PKNOX1 (21q.22.3) overexpression and may be indirectly related to DS neuropathogenesis by altering the expression of other genes ( ). APOE, GSAP, BACE1, IL1B, UBB, and SERPINA3 (non-Chr21) interacts with APP (Chr21); and GSAP, BACE1, UBB, and SERPINA3 (non-Chr21) interacts with BACE2 (Chr21). These genes are involved in lipid formulation and redistribution and A\u03b2P production, overactivity of these groups of genes may be responsible for AtD in DS. BACE1 activates the first step in A\u03b2P formation from APP ( ). BACE1 activity increased 2.3-folds in the cerebral cortex of foetuses with DS (18\u201319\u00a0weeks) and was comparable in over 50 years old brain with DS ( ). The significant overexpression of BACE1 in the foetus with DS and diminished activity in adults with DS suggests that DS phenotypes are not only due to the gene dosage hypothesis but may also reflect the associated neurodegeneration in the pathogenesis of AD in DS. SERPINA3/ACT inhibits the plasma protease. This protein targets and influences tissue-specific protease like endopeptidases, such as trypsin and chymotrypsin ( ;  ). All amyloid plaques and small amyloid deposits of Amyloid beta-protein (A\u03b2P) in Senile Dementia of Alzheimer\u2019s Type (SDAT) brain from (>50 years old) DS, AD and normal control had been alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) positive. These results may suggest that there is an association between ACT and A\u03b2P. ACT may be involved in Alzheimer\u2019s type of dementia in DS ( ) ( ,  ,   and  ). \n\n\n\n## Summary and Knowledge Gaps \n  \nOut of 202 genes on chromosome 21, only 21 genes were studied in the human brain with DS and 8 non-Chr21 genes were also studied in the human brain with DS. Not only the APP gene is responsible for dementia in DS, GATD3A, SOD1, ERG, BACE2, DSCR1/RCAN1, APOE (19q13.32), BACE1 (11q23.3), IL1B (2q14.1), GSAP (7q11.23), UBB (17p11.2), and IRS1 (2q36.3) genes may also play a major role in dementia in DS. Whilst DYRK1A, S100B, OLIG2 genes involved in neurogenesis and C21orf5/DOPEY2, DSCAM, SYNJ1, ITSN1 genes help to neuronal growth, targeting these genes in future has great potential for DS treatment. However, no gene studies were found for the brain with DS in humans during the embryonic period (3rd\u20138th week), which is the origin of the neural groove (primitive node) and the starting point for complex molecular signaling. Vaguely, we are unable to know about the expression of genes in the cells of the neocortical proliferative zone, which are essential for the initial patterning of the neocortex into cortical areas. It may be due to the unavailability of embryo samples and the limitation of current advanced prenatal diagnosis to detect DS in very early gestation. The most accurate screening test, the NIPT (Non-Invasive Pregnancy Test), is only available at 9\u201310\u00a0weeks of gestation. There is no other prenatal test earlier than that gestational age. Since DS starts with conception, we need to know the developmental changes at the very beginning at the molecular level. A mouse model of DS would be the only tool for early brain developmental studies. \n\n\n## Potential Treatment and Future Prospects \n  \nThere is no prevention or cure for DS as it is due to non-disjunction during meiosis before conception. Recent modern technology and ongoing experimental studies on DS provide hope for mothers who decide to continue pregnancy after the diagnosis of DS. Since neuropathology of DS starts in the embryonic period and neurogenesis only ceases at birth, prenatal therapy may improve the outcomes of DS neuropathogenesis and restore brain functions at anatomical, cellular, and molecular levels during the fetal and neonatal periods. Preclinical DS studies showed that ID and brain defects can be altered by early pharmacological intervention during pregnancy. For example, dietary choline supplementation during pregnancy and lactation enhanced cognitive functioning and emotion regulation in the Ts65Dn mouse model ( ). Choline is an important nutrient for the developing brain as it is essential for acetylcholine (Ach) biosynthesis. Ach is the main neurotransmitter in the regulation of neuronal proliferation, differentiation, maturation, plasticity, survival, migration, and synapse formation ( ). Dietary choline supplement could be given for all pregnant women to maintain proper health as well as brain development at cellular level and can be a potential early fetal intervention for known and unknown pregnancy with DS ( ;  ;  ). In addition, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a natural polyphenol family member and plays a crucial role in early brain development at the molecular level by inhibiting DYRK1A in transgenic overexpressed Dyrk1A mice during the prenatal period ( ;  ). Similarly, ALGERNON (as Altered Generation of Neurons) is a kinase inhibitor that promotes neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation by inhibiting DYRK1A in a mouse model of DS ( ).Restoring neurogenesis by inhibiting overexpressed Dyrk1A increases brain growth/volume at anatomical level ( ). There is evidence that supplementation of maternal folic acid and multivitamins before and during pregnancy is positively correlated with a reduced risk of ASD with ID in offspring when compared to no supplementation ( ;  ). Researchers continuously make efforts to find new ways to rescue DS neuropathogenesis by early prenatal and postnatal intervention, and hopefully, those therapies can be used in DS prenatal and postnatal intervention. There is an idea for repairing the genetic defects causing DS by the preliminary application of \u201cchromosome therapy,\u201d which unlike gene therapy, which is only for the disease caused by a single gene. Since DS is due to an extra copy of Chr21, \u201cchromosomal therapy\u201d could be applicable to \u201csilence\u201d or turn off the third copy of Chr21 by inserting XIST into Chr21 as in DS pluripotent stem cells ( ;  ). We look forward to further development and studies of rescued neuropathogenesis in feotuses with DS and in individuals with DS in the near future. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe mysterious cause behind ID in DS is yet unknown. It may be considered as an altered anatomical structure, such as decreased brain volume; cellular functions, such as hypocellularity in granular cell layers; and molecular pathways, such as transactivation resulting in dysfunction of higher brain functions. From this review, we came to know that the most crucial time of brain development is the embryonic period, when the main infrastructural changes determine the development of different brain regions. However, for the embryonic brain development in DS, no research information is yet available. So, research interest should be focused on the embryonic period (3rd to 8th weeks) by experimentation of the DS stem cell (e.g., iPS) and mouse models of DS to identify defects, if any. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9168127, "text_md5": "1de91fdca37a85e3a66446c8ec75d32b", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 50], "journal": [51, 70], "publication_year": [72, 76], "title": [87, 183], "keywords": [197, 268], "abstract": [281, 1468], "body": [1477, 56454]}, "part": 1, "chapter": 3, "page": 3, "pmid": 35676933, "doi": "10.3389/fcell.2022.877711"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9168127>9168127</a> \u2014 Part 1 Chapter 3 Page 3", "list_title": "1.3.3  Developmental Neuropathology and Neurodegeneration of Down Syndrome: Current Knowledge in Humans"}
