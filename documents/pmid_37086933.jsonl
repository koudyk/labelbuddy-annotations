The spread of reported brain activations suggests that mental rotation is subserved by a neural network circle. However, no common network has yet been found that uncovers the crucial processes underlying this ability. We aimed to identify the common network crucial for mental rotation by coordinate-based network mapping of previous neuroimaging findings in mental rotation. A meta-analysis revealed 710 peak activation coordinates from 42 fMRI studies in mental rotation, which include a total 844 participants. The coordinates were mapped to a normative functional connectome (n\u00a0=\u00a01000) to identify a network of connected regions. To account for experimental factors, we examined this network against two control tasks, action imitation and symbolic number processing. A common and crucial network for mental rotation, centring on dorsal premotor, superior parietal and inferior temporal lobes was revealed. This network, separated from other experimental aspects, suggests that the crucial processes underlying mental rotation are motor rotation, visuospatial processing, and higher order visual object recognition.
