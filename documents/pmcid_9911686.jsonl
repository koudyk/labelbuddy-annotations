Two investigators independently performed literature selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. The methodological quality was assessed with a modified version of the checklist.

Regarding the immediate effect of acupuncture on migraine, the ALE meta-analysis demonstrated that the deactivation regions were mainly located in the superior frontal gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus (uncorrected   P   < 0.001). The ALE meta-analysis of the cumulative effect showed that the activation regions were the thalamus, superior frontal gyrus, posterior lobe of the cerebellum, insula, middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, anterior cingulate, and the deactivation brain regions were located in the transverse temporal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, anterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and inferior occipital gyrus (uncorrected   P   < 0.001). \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nAcupuncture could activate multiple brain areas related with the regulation of pain conduction, processing, emotion, cognition, and other brain regions in patients with migraine. In the future, the combination of multiple imaging technologies could be a new approach to deeply investigate the central mechanism of acupuncture for migraine. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nMigraine is a chronic paroxysmal neurological disorder, along with multiphase attacks of headache and a myriad of neurological symptoms ( ). According to epidemiological statistics ( ), the global age-standardized point prevalence and annual incidence rate of migraine were 14,107.3 and 1,142.5 per 100,000 in 2019, and migraine prevalence peaks in 40 to 44 age group. Migraine sufferers have a variety of problems that can lead to decreased productivity at school, at home, and in society. Globally, migraine is the leading cause of years lived with disability (YLDs) accounting for 45.1 million YLDs annually ( ). The economic costs of migraine are substantial. The high prevalence and societal burden of migraine have contributed to the acknowledgment of migraine as a serious public health concern. At present, pharmaceutical treatment for migraine is the most basic and common treatment. However, the efficacy of most existing drugs for migraine is limited, and long-term use may produce significant side effects, such as addiction, and overdose deaths ( ). For the management of migraine, safe, effective, and acceptable non-pharmacological treatments are crucial to solve this problem. \n\nMounting evidence supports the application of acupuncture to prevent and treat migraines, due to its long-term effectiveness, good tolerance, and fewer side effects. A Cochrane review from Germany concluded that acupuncture was effective and safe for episodic migraine prophylaxis when compared with prophylactic drug treatment ( ). Apart from reducing pain, acupuncture may be beneficial for migraineurs with co-morbid problems such as anxiety, insomnia, and muscle tension ( ;  ). Acupuncture imaging studies have confirmed that the anti-migraine mechanism of acupuncture is closely related to the regulation of cerebral activities, which can modulate the functional and structural brain in patients with migraine ( ).   found that acupuncture could normalize the decreased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of the rostral ventromedial medulla/trigeminocervical complex in migraineurs.   observed that the region homogeneity (ReHo) values in the cerebellum and angular gyrus increased significantly after 12 sessions of acupuncture treatment in patients with migraine.   discovered that acupuncture could increase the functional connectivity (FC) of brain regions in patients with migraine. Nevertheless, the underlying central mechanism of acupuncture for migraine is still not completely studied. \n\nThe resting-state fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) is used to measure the spontaneous activity of neurons by enabling the recording of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals. Three indicators are commonly used to determine spontaneous brain activity: ALFF, fractional ALFF (fALFF), and ReHo ( ;  ). ALFF and fALFF reflect the regional intensity of spontaneous fluctuations in the BOLD signal ( ;  ). ReHo indicates the synchronization and consistency of the BOLD signal between a single voxel and neighboring voxels ( ). Therefore, the combination of ALFF, fALFF, and ReHo can fully present spontaneous activity of the local brain. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) is an effective method for meta-analysis of brain neuroimaging, which is a brain region localization analysis method based on voxel coordinates, and the brain region localization can be achieved by carrying out 3D Gaussian smoothing and permutation tests of the relevant coordinates in the included studies. Previous reviews narratively summarized the functional brain changes of acupuncture in patients with migraine ( ;  ), while quantitative meta-analyses were not performed. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the acupuncture-related brain regions in migraineurs with ALE algorithm. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \nThe protocol of this ALE-meta analysis has already been registered on the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY)  (registration number: INPLASY2022110026). The present study was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement ( ). \n\n### 2.1. Literature search \n  \nWe performed a comprehensive search in the following databases from their inception to August 18, 2022: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Wanfang Database, and the China Biology Medicine (CBM). Both Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free-text words related to acupuncture, migraine, and fMRI were used to retrieve relevant studies. We additionally searched the references of the included studies. We consulted the specialists for possible eligible studies. The full search strategies for all databases are shown in  . \n\n\n### 2.2. Inclusion criteria \n  \nWe included studies that met the following criteria: \n  \nThe patients were diagnosed with migraine by any internationally recognized or accepted clinical guideline or consensus like The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (beta version) ( ); \n  \nThe intervention involved electro-acupuncture or manual acupuncture; no limitations on manipulation methods of acupuncture, acupoint selection, and duration of acupuncture; \n  \nThe studies reported neuroimaging results (ReHo, ALFF, or fALFF) of pre- and post-acupuncture treatment   via   fMRI using the standard anatomical template; \n  \nBoth randomized controlled trials and clinical controlled trials were included. \n  \n\n### 2.3. Exclusion criteria \n  \nWe excluded studies that fulfilled the following criteria: \n  \nNo detailed description of the diagnostic criteria; \n  \nFull texts were unavailable through extensive search; \n  \nCoordinates could not be obtained through various approaches; \n  \nThe results were based on the region of interest. \n  \n\n### 2.4. Study selection \n  \nThe retrieved records were imported into Endnote (X9). After removing duplicates, two researchers (X-BL and X-YG) independently eliminated irrelevant records by reading the titles and abstracts, then screened the rest records in full text to identify eligible studies. After selection, two reviewers cross-checked, and disagreements were settled through team discussion or consultation with the third reviewer (JL). \n\n\n### 2.5. Data extraction \n  \nTwo independent reviewers (X-BL and X-YG) extracted the following information: (1) publication information: title, first author, year of publication; (2) demographic characteristics: types of migraine, diagnostic criteria, sample size, characteristics of the study population (age, gender); (3) intervention details: manipulation methods of acupuncture, frequency, duration, and sessions; (4) neuroimaging data: MRI acquisition, processing parameters, analysis parameters, activation coordinates (POST > PRE), and deactivation coordinates (PRE > POST), along with their associated standard anatomical template. If a study observed the neuroimaging results of different acupoints or needle stimulations, we extracted data separately. After extraction, two reviewers cross-checked to ensure accuracy. Any disagreement was resolved through discussion or arbitration by a third reviewer (JL). \n\n\n### 2.6. Assessment of methodological quality \n  \nA modified version of checklist ( ;  ) was used to assess the methodological quality of individual functional neuroimaging studies. The checklist contains two domains (Category 1: Sample characteristics, Category 2: Methodology and reporting) with 13 items. The overall score is 20 points. The higher the score, the better the methodological quality. Before the formal evaluation, two reviewers intensively discussed the checklist to achieve consensus. Then two independent reviewers (X-BL and X-YG) assessed and cross-checked the results. Discrepancies were resolved by team discussion. \n\n\n### 2.7. Evaluation of reporting quality of interventions in controlled trials of acupuncture \n  \nThe Revised Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) was used to appraise the reporting quality of interventions in controlled trials of acupuncture ( ). The STRICTA consists of six items (17 sub-items), including acupuncture rationale, details of needling, treatment regimen, co-interventions, practitioner background, and control or comparator interventions. Then the two independent reviewers (X-BL and X-YG) assessed and cross-checked the results. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer (JL). \n\n\n### 2.8. Statistical analysis \n  \nThe ALE meta-analysis was performed with the Ginger ALE software (version 2.3.6) . The data analysis process was as follows: (1) Data organization: 3D (X, Y, Z) coordinates in the standard space included were organized into text files. (2) Convert coordinate format: Talairach space coordinates were converted into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space coordinates using Ginger ALE software. (3) Parameter settings: uncorrected   P   < 0.001, and Min.Volume 150 mm  ( ). (4) Viewing results: the results were presented in an Excel spreadsheet, and the ALE maps were overlaid onto the MNI template and viewed with MRIcron . The process of data analysis is presented in  . \n  \nThe process of ALE analysis. \n  \n\n### 2.9. Sensitivity analysis \n  \nThe reproducibility of the ALE meta-analysis results was assessed using the Jackknife sensitivity analysis method. That is, all studies were excluded one by one, and the remaining studies were re-analyzed. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Search selection \n  \nThe flow diagram of study selection is shown in  . A total of 338 records were retrieved in the literature search. Following the removal of 112 duplicates, 212 irrelevant records were eliminated based on their titles and abstracts, and 20 records were excluded based on full-text screening. Finally, we identified 14 eligible studies. The list of excluded records with reasons is provided in  . \n  \nFlow diagram of literature search. \n  \n\n### 3.2. Study overview \n  \nWe identified 14 eligible studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) for this ALE meta-analysis, of which 9 were in Chinese and 5 in English. There were 9 randomized controlled trials and 5 non-randomized controlled trials. With regards to the subtypes of migraine patients, 4 studies included patients with menstrual migraine, 4 studies enrolled migraine patients without aura, and 6 studies did not describe the subtypes of migraine. As for the analytical method, 3 studies used both the ALFF and ReHo, 8 studies adopted the ReHo, and 3 studies applied the ALFF. The details of all the included studies are presented in  . \n  \nCharacteristics of included studies. \n    \nThe needle stimulations were manual acupuncture (13 studies) and electro-acupuncture (1 study). There were 11 studies focused on the long-term efficacy of acupuncture for migraine and 5 studies on the immediate efficacy of acupuncture for migraine. Four studies included acupuncture with different acupoint protocols. The details of acupuncture treatment are shown in  . \n  \nIntervention details of included studies. \n    \nNeuroimaging data was acquired at either 1.5 T (1 study) or 3 T (12 studies), while one study did not specify the magnetic field strength. Most of the studies used the Siemens MRI scanner (8 studies), others included General Electric (4 studies), United Imaging Medical Systems (1 study), and 1 study did not report the scanner. Most of the structural images were obtained using fast spoiled gradient sequence (9 studies), magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo sequence (MPRAGE) (2 studies), and 3 studies did not specify the T1. T2-functional images were mainly from the echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (12 studies). Statistical analysis was conducted in either statistical parametric mapping (SPM) (13 studies) or data processing assistant for resting-state fMRI (DPARSF) (1 study). The details of MRI acquisition and analysis are demonstrated in  . \n  \nThe details of MRI acquisition and analysis. \n    \n\n### 3.3.

The STRICTA checklist is shown in  . \n\n\n### 3.5. ALE meta-analysis results \n  \n#### 3.5.1. The immediate effect of acupuncture \n  \nFive studies evaluated the immediate effects of acupuncture on migraine ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). We extracted 82 foci with brain activation regions from 6 experiments, and 61 foci with brain deactivation regions from 5 experiments in patients with migraine after acupuncture treatment. No significant clusters with activation brain were detected between pre-acupuncture and post-acupuncture treatment. One significant cluster with deactivation brain was found between pre-acupuncture and post-acupuncture treatment: the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG, 168 mm , BA9). The specific analysis results are presented in   and  . \n  \nChanges of brain activation in patients with pre- to post- acupuncture. \n      \nRegions of brain activation in patients with pre- to post- acupuncture (immediate effect).

The cumulative effect of acupuncture \n  \nThe data from 11 studies were pooled to investigate the cumulative effect of acupuncture on migraine ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). We extracted the 77 foci with brain activation regions from 13 experiments and 83 foci with brain deactivation regions from 12 experiments in patients with migraine after acupuncture treatment. Seven activated clusters were found between pre-acupuncture and post-acupuncture treatment: (1) the right thalamus (THA, 976 mm ); (2) the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG, 400 mm , BA8); (3) the left posterior lobe (376 mm ); (4) the right insula (INS, 344 mm , BA13); (5) the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG, 272 mm , BA8); (6) the right precentral gyrus (PreCG, 224 mm , BA6); (7) the left anterior cingulate (ACC, 208 mm , BA24). Five deactivated clusters were detected between pre-acupuncture and post-acupuncture treatment: (1) the right transverse temporal gyrus (TTG, 744 mm , BA41); (2) the left anterior cingulate (ACC, 328 mm , BA32); (3) the left parahippocampal gyrus (PHG, 192 mm ); (4) the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL, 192 mm , BA40); (5) the left inferior occipital gyrus (IOG, 160 mm , BA19).

Sensitivity analysis \n  \nWe conducted a sensitivity analysis on the immediate effect and cumulative effect of acupuncture, and the details are shown in  . Leave-one-out analysis of the immediate effect (post-acupuncture < pre-acupuncture) showed that the repeatability of the left SFG was up to 3/5 times of analysis, and MFG was up to 4/5 times of analysis. Leave-one-out analysis of the cumulative effect (post-acupuncture > pre-acupuncture) revealed that right THA, MFG was up to 12/13 times of analysis; right SFG, INS, PreCG, and left posterior lobe of the cerebellum, ACC was up to 11/13 times of analysis. Leave-one-out analysis of the cumulative effect (post-acupuncture < pre-acupuncture) showed that the repeatability of the right TTG, Postcentral gyrus (PoCG), Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG), and left ACC, PHG, IPL, IOG was up to 10/12 times of analysis. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we used the ALE method to perform a quantitative integration analysis of previously published original research and to identify the cerebral responses to acupuncture for migraine. The ALE analysis results of immediate acupuncture treatment showed that the deactivation regions located in the SFG and MFG. The ALE analysis results of cumulative acupuncture treatment revealed that the activation regions were the THA, SFG, posterior lobe of the cerebellum, INS, MFG, PreCG, ACC and the deactivation brain regions were the TTG, PoCG, STG, ACC, PHG, IPL, and IOG. The consistent results of immediate and cumulative change were the THA, INS, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, limbic system, and cerebellum. Pain is a multidimensional subjective experience generally including sensory (intensity, location), affective (unpleasantness, fear), and cognitive factors (memory, attention) ( ). The brain processing network of pain can be divided into the medial and lateral pain systems, which are respectively involved in processing the affective-cognitive-evaluative aspects of pain, and the sensory-discriminative aspects ( ). Based on our findings, we found that several regions of the lateral and medial pain systems (including the THA, INS, ACC, SFG, MFG, and PoCG) participated in the cerebral responses to acupuncture for migraine. \n\nThe medial and ventrobasal parts of THA are separately involved in the medial and lateral pain pathways. In migraine pathogenesis, THA is considered as the relay center of ascending nociceptive information ( ).   observed that the regional fALFF values of the bilateral ventral posteromedial thalamus was positively correlated with the duration of migraine.   discovered N-acetylaspartate/creatine increased in bilateral THA of migraineurs after acupuncture, which was significantly related with the headache intensity. The anterior part of the INS encodes the emotional processing of pain, and the posterior part encodes the intensity and lateralization of pain. Thus, the INS plays an integrative role in nociceptive processing.   found that the duration of migraine was negatively associated with gray matter (GM) alterations in the left INS.   revealed that the INS was activated to integrate sensory and affective information and to produce analgesic effects during acupuncture stimulation. Our ALE meta-analysis showed that the activity of ACC (BA24) increased, while the activity of ACC (BA32) decreased after acupuncture in migraineurs. The ACC is considered to be involved in the affective-motivational component of pain ( ).   discovered that the dynamic ALFF values in the ACC were negatively correlated with pain intensity in migraine. The ACC plays a different role in pain processing.   found that the increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in area 24\u2019 of ACC may be involved in nocifensive reflex inhibition, and the reduced rCBF in area 32 of ACC may enhance pain perception in the surrounding cortex.   also discovered that the caudal part of the ACC (BA24) signal increased during the electrical acupoint stimulation, which positively related with the analgesic effect. Therefore, different parts of ACC may play different roles in the acupuncture-induced analgesic effect. The SFG is located at the superior part of the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for emotion regulation ( ). And the MFG is crucial to attention ( ). The increased GM in the right SFG and the decreased GM in the left MFG were observed in migraineurs ( ).   demonstrated that the decreased FC between the SFG and precuneus could restore to the healthy control level after acupuncture treatments.   found that the FC between the MFG and the dorsal ACC reduced in migraineurs, and the decreased connectivity in the MFG was negatively related to the pain intensity of migraine attacks. The PoCG located in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI), which is involved in the adjustment of pain perception, including the positioning and recognition of pain intensity ( ).   discovered that increased brain activity of the right PoCG is positively correlated with headache frequency in patients with migraine.   also found that cerebral glucose metabolism decreased in the PoCG after acupuncture in migraine. \n\nBesides, the TTG, STG, IPL, HPG, IOG, PreCG, and posterior lobe of the cerebellum are also involved in the analgesic effect of acupuncture. The temporal lobe is recognized as a region associated with multisensory integration. An analysis of voxel-based morphometric studies of migraine ( ) showed that GM increased in the bilateral temporal poles, the bilateral STG, the right SFG, and the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) in migraine patients, and the frequency of migraine attacks was negatively associated with GM alteration in the left STG. This suggests that the temporal lobe is involved in pain regulation.   revealed that the STG and MTG may be the key nodes linked to the multisensory processing of pain modulation in patients with migraine during acupuncture. It has been confirmed that the cerebellum plays an important role in pain processing and regulation ( ).   observed that patients with migraine had significantly higher ALFF levels in the posterior lobe of the cerebellum in contrast with healthy controls.   revealed that the duration of migraine was negatively associated with GM alterations in the bilateral cerebellum (hemispheric lobule IX).   also found that GM increased in the PHG, and GM decreased in the IPL.   discovered that reduced FC between the right IPL and right MFG, and the FC Z-scores between the ventral posterior nucleus (VPN) and right IPL were negatively related with pain intensity and disease duration in migraine. The PHG is involved in pain perception, pain modulation, and descending pain facilitation ( ).   found that acupuncture could reduce brain glucose metabolism of PHG in migraine.   observed that compared with healthy subjects, the PreCG exhibited abnormal centrality in both structural and FC networks in migraineurs, and negative correlations were observed between migraine duration and PreCG. Our results indicated that IOG also participated in acupuncture-induced analgesia, while few studies supported the finding. \n\nThere were 5 studies focused on the immediate effect of acupuncture and 11 studies on the cumulative effect. The results of ALE meta-analysis showed that both SFG and MFG were associated with immediate and cumulative effects, but the activity of SFG and MFG decreased after immediate acupuncture and increased after cumulative acupuncture. A possible explanation for the inconsistent results may be related to the number of included studies, which needs further investigation. Simultaneously, the neuroimaging results indicated that cumulative acupuncture treatment could induce a more extensive and remarkable cerebral response in contrast with single acupuncture treatment. \n\n\n## 5. Strengths and limitations \n  \nIn this meta-analysis, there are several strengths. First, instead of descriptive analysis, we used the ALE methodology to analyze the brain changes of acupuncture intervention in patients with migraine. Second, the present study analyzed the imaging studies on the immediate and cumulative effects of acupuncture in patients with migraine. Third, we comprehensively evaluated the methodological quality and the reporting quality of interventions with a modified version of checklist and STRICTA. Nevertheless, there are several limitations. First, due to the limitations of the analytical method, funnel plot was unavailable to detect the publication bias of the included studies. Second, we failed to compare the brain changes of patients with migraine after acupuncture with those in healthy individuals due to the incomplete information among included studies. Third, the STRICTA results showed that the protocol of acupuncture was not reported adequately, researchers should report in accordance with STRICTA to improve the reporting quality. \n\n\n## 6. Conclusion \n  \nAcupuncture could activate multiple brain areas related with the regulation of pain conduction, processing, emotion, cognition, and other brain regions in patients with migraine. In the future, the combination of multiple imaging technologies might be a new approach to deeply investigate the central mechanism of acupuncture for migraine. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nJZ designed the protocol, conducted this review, and drafted the manuscript.
