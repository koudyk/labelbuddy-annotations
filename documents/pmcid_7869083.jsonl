However, the only brain atlases available are derived from samples of young adults. As brain networks are continuously reconfigured throughout life, the lack of brain atlases derived from older populations may influence RSN results in late adulthood. To address this gap, the aim of the study was to construct a reliable brain atlas derived only from older participants. We leveraged resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from three cohorts of healthy older adults (total   N  \u2009=\u2009563; age\u2009=\u200955\u201395\u00a0years) and a younger-adult cohort (  N  \u2009=\u2009128; age\u2009=\u200918\u201335\u00a0years). We identified the major RSNs and their subdivisions across all older-adult cohorts. We demonstrated high spatial reproducibility of these RSNs with an average spatial overlap of 67%. Importantly, the RSNs derived from the older-adult cohorts were spatially different from those derived from the younger-adult cohort (  P  \u2009=\u20092.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ). Lastly, we constructed a novel brain atlas, called Atlas55+, which includes the consensus of the major RSNs and their subdivisions across the older-adult cohorts. Thus, Atlas55+ provides a reliable age-appropriate template for RSNs in late adulthood and is publicly available. Our results confirm the need for age-appropriate functional atlases for studies investigating aging-related brain mechanisms. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been instrumental in mapping the brain functional connectome in health ( ;  ;  ;  ) and disease ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The brain functional connectome can be defined as a multiscale partition in which regions may be aggregated into networks, which in turn may be combined into larger systems ( ;  ;  ). Previous work by us and others suggest that the intermediate partition of the brain at the level of networks may be optimal to explain cognitive activity and to identify reliable biomarkers of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), while limiting multiple comparisons when compared to finer brain partitions ( ). At this level of brain organization, five major resting-state networks (RSNs) and their subdivisions have been typically identified across rs-fMRI studies: those involved in internally guided, higher order mental functions as part of the intrinsic system (default mode [DMN], executive control [ECN], and salience [SAL] networks) and those supporting externally driven, specialized sensory and motor processing as part of the extrinsic system (visual [VIS] and sensorimotor [SMN] networks) ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Each of these brain networks relies on established white matter (WM) pathways ( ;  ;  ) that support the consistency of their spatiotemporal configuration and functional roles ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nSeveral brain functional atlases are currently available which support reproducibility by harmonizing the RSN definition across neuroimaging studies ( ). However, to date, the only brain functional atlases available are derived from samples of young healthy adults, typically below the age of 40\u00a0years ( ). Nonetheless, changes in brain function over the course of adulthood have been well-documented and suggest that brain networks are continuously reconfigured throughout adult life ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). To our knowledge, there is currently no reference brain functional atlas derived from rs-fMRI data from older adults, and this may undermine neuroimaging efforts to characterize the brain functional connectome and its cognitive role in late adulthood. Critically, differences in the spatial composition of the RSNs derived from large samples of younger versus older adults have yet to be systematically investigated. \n\nIn this context, the current study focused on the spatial definition of the five major RSNs (DMN, ECN, SAL, VIS, and SMN) and their subdivisions in healthy adults aged 55\u00a0years and older. The specific aims were: (1) to test the reproducibility of RSNs in three large independent cohorts comprising a total of 563 older healthy adults (age range: 55\u201395\u00a0years); accordingly, we analyzed data from the Center for Aging and Neuroscience (CamCAN) project ( ;  ), the Southwest University Adult Lifespan Dataset (SALD) ( ) and the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database ( ;  ); (2) to identify differences in the anatomical constitution of RSNs defined in the above cohorts compared to those in younger adults (age range 18\u201335); and (3) generate a reliable consensual RSN atlas to enhance the reproducibility of template-defined RSNs in older adults. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Cohorts \n  \n#### Older-Adult Cohorts \n  \nWe used data from the CamCAN ( ;  ), the SALD ( ) and the ADNI datasets ( ;  ). In each cohort, we selected healthy individuals aged 55\u00a0years and above for whom both rs-fMRI and structural MRI data were available. This selection resulted in a sample of 250 individuals for CamCAN (referred to as \u201cCamCAN55+\u201d), 190 for SALD, and 134 for ADNI (details in  ). Following quality control of the imaging data (described below), 11 participants across cohorts were removed for excessive head motion. The total analysis sample for the older individuals comprised 563 individuals, described in   and  . \n  \nCohort characteristics \n  \nCamCAN, Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience; SALD, Southwest University Adult Lifespan Dataset; ADNI, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; TR, repetition time; rs-fMRI; resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging sequence. \n  \n\n#### Younger-Adult Cohort \n  \nA subset of the CamCAN cohort, referred to as \u201cCamCAN35-\u201d, was used to test for differences between younger (18\u201335\u00a0years old) and older (55\u00a0years and older) adults in RSN spatial composition. This age range was chosen to match the typical age range of healthy participants used in currently available functional atlases ( ). The CamCAN35\u2212 included 128 individuals. Following the same quality control process, we excluded two individuals from CamCan35\u2212 ( ). \n\n\n\n### Resting-State fMRI Acquisition and Preprocessing \n  \nIn the CamCAN cohort, rs-fMRI data were acquired while participants rest with their eyes closed on a 3\u00a0T Siemens TIM Trio scanner with a 32-channel head coil with the following acquisition parameters: TR/TE\u2009=\u20091970/30\u00a0msec, 32 axial slices, flip angle =78\u00b0; FOV =192\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009192\u00a0mm; voxel-size\u2009=\u20093\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u20094.44\u00a0mm, acquisition time\u2009=\u20098\u00a0min 40\u00a0sec, number of volumes: 261. More information on the MRI sequences can be found in  . \n\nIn the SALD cohort, rs-fMRI data were acquired while participants rest with their eyes closed on a 3\u00a0T Siemens Trio scanner, using the following acquisition parameters ( ): TR/TE\u2009=\u20092000/30\u00a0msec, 32 axial slices, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0; FOV\u2009=\u2009220\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009220\u00a0mm; voxel-size\u2009=\u20093.4\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u00a0mm, acquisition time\u2009=\u20098\u00a0min, number of volumes: 242. More information on the MRI sequences can be found in  ). \n\nIn the ADNI cohort, rs-fMRI data were acquired while participants kept their eyes open. Acquisition tool place in 43 sites using 3\u00a0T scanners (General Electric [GE], Philips or Siemens) and variable acquisition protocols (details in  ) that commonly used a TR\u2009=\u20093000\u00a0sec, with 140\u2013200 volumes. When multiple resting-state fMRI datasets were available for a participant, the first one was selected for analyses. \n\nRegardless of the cohort, the rs-fMRI data were preprocessed in an identical fashion, using SPM12 and the DPABI Toolbox ( ). Preprocessing procedures for the rs-fMRI datasets included removal of the first three volumes, motion correction to the first volume with rigid-body alignment; coregistration between the functional scans and the anatomical T1-weighted scan; spatial normalization of the functional images into Montreal Neurological Institute stereotaxic standard space; spatial smoothing within the functional mask with a 6-mm at full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel; wavelet despiking ( ); linear detrending; and regression of motion parameters and their derivatives (24-parameter model) ( ), as well as WM, CSF time series. The WM and CSF signals were computed using a component based noise reduction method (CompCor, 5 principal components) ( ). Lastly, bandpass filtering was applied at 0.01\u20130.1 Hz ( ). \n\nAs previously mentioned, across the three older-adult cohorts, we excluded 11 individuals who had excessive head movement based on maximum transient (volume-to-volume) head motion above 2\u00a0mm translation or 1\u00b0 rotation. After removing these individuals, we ensured that head motion, based on the mean framewise displacement ( ) did not correlate with age (  r  \u2009=\u20090.08). Following the same process, we excluded two individuals from the CamCan35\u2212 cohort. \n\n\n### Resting-State Networks in the Older-Adult Cohorts \n  \n#### Resting-State Networks Identification in the Older-Adult Cohorts \n  \nWe used a process validated by   to identify reliable brain networks. First, for each individual within each cohort, single-subject independent component analyses (ICAs) were conducted 20 times with random initialization using the Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components software, version 3.15, included in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) v6.0.3 ( ) ( ). The number of independent components (ICs) was estimated by Laplace approximation ( ). A symmetric approach of the FastICA algorithm ( ) was used to compute the ICAs. Second, for each repetition, we used the multiscale clustering of individual component algorithm (MICCA) to classify ICs into   N   groups ( ). The number of groups was automatically estimated by the algorithm ( ). Third, the   Icasso   algorithm ( ) was used to select groups of reproducible ICs (i.e., groups with ICs that were present in at least 50% of the 20 repetitions), which we identified as the \u201cgroup-level components\u201d ( ). Fourth, for each group-level component, a voxel-wise   t  -score map of individual ICs was computed and thresholded using a mixture model (  P  \u2009>\u20090.95, ( )). Lastly, we discarded group-level components if their spatial map: (1) mainly covered nongray matter (i.e., CSF and WM), or (2) included regions with strong signal attenuation due to susceptibility artifacts (i.e., lower frontal and lower temporal regions) ( \u2013 ). \n\n\n#### Spatial Overlap of Group-Level Components in Older-Adult Cohorts \n  \nWithin each cohort, we mapped the spatial overlap across the group-level components by computing an index that quantified the number of group-level components overlapping at each voxel. This voxel-wise index ranged from 1 (no spatial overlap, the voxel is assigned to only one component) to   n   (where   n   is the maximum number of components overlapping at a voxel). \n\nAs the goal of the current study was to create a reliable functional atlas of RSNs, we created nonoverlapping group-level components, on which we based the remaining analyses. Accordingly, each brain voxel was assigned to the group-level components with the highest   t  -score  .  \n\n\n#### Reliability Analyses of the Group-Level Components in Older-Adult Cohorts \n  \nAs the spatial configuration of a brain network is strongly related with its functional connectivity ( ), we conducted supplementary analyses to assess the functional reliability of each group-level component, in each cohort, following the methods described in  ) ( ). In each cohort, we generated a dendrogram based on the average connectivity matrix between the group-level components. The functional reliability of a group-level component depended on the number of times it maintained the same position in the dendrogram of each individual participant of the same cohort. We created a reliability index (Q) for each group-level component, where a score close to zero indicated perfect functional reliability and a high score indicated high functional unreliability (details in   and  ). We conducted Tukey\u2019s fences tests to identify and discard these highly unreliable group-level components. \n\n\n#### Construction of the Major RSNs in Older-Adult Cohorts \n  \nWe chose to focus on the major RSNs defined as: the DMN, the ECN, the SAL, the SMN, and the VIS ( ;  ;  ) and their subdivisions and examined their spatial definition across the three cohorts. \n\nFollowing the identification of nonoverlapping and functionally reliable group-level components in each cohort, we proceeded to assigning them to the major RSNs of interest, namely the DMN, ECN, SAL, VIS, and SMN. As reference for each network, we used their spatial definition in the Consensual Atlas of REsting-state Networks (CAREN) ( ). This atlas was generated by our group and presents the spatial configuration of the major RSNs based on their common properties across the most widely used brain functional atlases and as such it represents the most reproducible spatial features of the major RSNs currently available. This choice was also based on the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, there are currently no validated and reproducible RSNs from rs-fMRI data of a large sample of older healthy individuals that we could use as normative templates. \n\nIn each cohort, we computed the Dice coefficient ( ) to quantify the degree of spatial overlap between each group-level component and each of the five aforementioned CAREN RSNs. Components were then assigned to the RSN with which they had the largest overlap ( ). We applied this process to each cohort separately to create spatial maps of the major RSNs. We were thus able to construct a spatial map for each RSN. We used the Dice coefficient to test the pairwise similarity between the same-labeled RSNs across cohorts. Lastly, to ensure that the results did not depend on the template used (i.e., CAREN), we also used the atlas created by  ) for the RSN assignment. \n\n\n\n### Spatial Comparison of the Major RSNs Between Young and Older Adults \n  \nPrior to testing for differences in the spatial constitution of RSNs between older and younger adults we constructed the major RSNs in the CamCAN35\u2212 by applying the same procedure as for the older cohorts ( ). \n\nWe then compared their respective RSNs to those derived from the other two independent cohorts (ADNI and SALD). For this, we used Dice\u2019s coefficient to quantify the spatial similarity of the RSNs in CamCAN35\u2212, and in CamCAN55+ respectively, to those of SALD and ADNI, and compared these pairwise coefficients (i.e., we compared the coefficients resulting from the RSN comparison CamCAN55+ vs. SALD and ADNI to those resulting from the RSN comparison CamCAN35\u2212 vs. SALD and ADNI). This choice of approach was based on two major reasons: (1) among the three cohorts, CamCAN was the largest and also provided more reliable data (having the largest number of rs-fMRI volumes ( ),  ); and (2) this approach enabled us to account for differences in analytic approach, site, and MRI acquisition parameters. \n\n\n### Generation of Atlas55+ \n  \nThe major RSNs identified in each of the three older-adult cohorts were used as input data to create a consensual atlas, named Atlas55+. For this, we used the function   consensus_similarity.m   from the Network Community Toolbox ( ), which constructs a representative partition. \n\nTo test the spatial reproducibility of the major RSNs in Atlas55+, we conducted supplementary analyses: (1) we assigned each brain voxel to a network only if at least two of the three older-adult cohorts assigned this voxel to the same network. We then computed a spatial correlation between the two versions of Atlas55+ using Pearson\u2019s correlation analyses. (2) We created a voxel-wise confidence map to quantify the consistency of the network assignment between the RSNs of the atlas and those from each of the three older-adult cohorts. This voxel-wise index ranged from 0 (poor confidence, the network assignment of a voxel in Atlas55+ differed from its network assignment in all three cohorts) to 100% (high confidence, the network assignment of a voxel in Atlas55+ was identical to its network assignment in all three cohorts). Lastly, we compared the RSNs of the atlas to those of CamCAN35\u2212 in order to quantify the spatial differences between RSNs from younger adults and older adults, computing Dice coefficients. \n\nTo identify the anatomical definition of each major RSN in the atlas, we generated subject-specific versions using a dual regression approach in FSL ( ;  ). We then entered each network into a one-sample   t   test, adding age, head motion (mean framewise displacement), estimated total intracranial volume (TIV, measured using FreeSurfer v6.0 ( )), and site as covariates of no interest. Significant regions were reported at a   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 after applying a family wise error (FWE) correction at the voxel level (  T  \u2009>\u20095.3, cluster size\u2009>\u200920 voxels). \n\n\n### Subdivisions of the RSNs within Atlas55+ \n  \nWe then focused on the subdivisions of each RSN within Atlas55+ to increase the spatial resolution of the atlas across the three older-adult cohorts. \n\nFor each major RSN, we quantified the degree of spatial overlap between the group-level components assigned to that RSN across the three cohorts, using Dice coefficients ( ). Based on these coefficients, we constructed a dendrogram and identified clusters with high spatial overlap across independent group-level components, with one component from each of the three cohorts ( ). Lastly, we created a spatial map for each of these clusters, which displays the spatial characteristics of a subdivision of that RSN ( ). A voxel was identified as part of that RSN subdivision if it was found in at least two out of the three components. We chose to focus on clusters with contributions from all three older-adult cohorts because this suggests that these components were reliably found in each cohort and therefore were minimally influenced by acquisition parameters. \n\n\n### Effects of Sex and Age on the Major five RSNs in the Atlas55+ \n  \nThe effect of age on the spatial distribution of each major RSN in the atlas (extracted from the dual regression) across all individuals (total   n  \u2009=\u2009563) was tested by conducting an analysis of covariance, adding covariates of no interest: head motion, TIV, and site. Sex differences in the spatial distribution of the RSNs in the atlas were also assessed using age, head motion, TIV, and site as covariates of no interest. Significant clusters are reported at a   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 with FWE correction at the voxel level (  T  \u2009>\u20095.3, cluster size\u2009>\u200920 voxels). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Identification of Group-Level Components in the Older-Adult Cohorts \n  \nIn the CamCAN55+, SALD and ADNI cohorts, we respectively identified a total of 27, 24 and 23 reproducible group-level components ( \u2013  and  ). For the CamCAN55+ cohort, we found that 27% of the voxels were assigned to a single group-level component, whereas less than 0.5% of the voxels were assigned to a maximum of nine group-level components. The degree of spatial overlap between components was similar for the other two cohorts ( ). Regardless of cohort, the regions with the highest overlap were located in the medial posterior cortex, the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex and the lateral parietal cortex ( ). \n\nRegardless of cohort, the functional reliability tests showed that all group-level components had a similar degree of stability, with no outlier, across individuals and in each cohort ( ). The reliability Q scores of each component did not differ across cohorts (  P  \u2009>\u20090.1). \n\n\n### Construction and Reliability of the Major RSNs in the Older-Adult Cohorts \n  \nThe five RSNs constructed in each older-adult cohort ( ) showed high spatial reproducibility across the three cohorts with an average spatial overlap of 67% (mean range: 66\u201369%), with the SAL having the lowest score (46%) and the VIS having the highest score (83%) ( ).   shows the voxel-wise confidence values with respect to the probability of a voxel being assigned to the same-labeled RSN across the three cohorts. The majority of voxels (83.5%) had confidence values over 66%, indicating that at least two out of the three cohorts had the same RSN assignment. \n  \nSpatial map of the five major RSNs. (  A  ) CamCAN55+, (  B  ) SALD, and (  C  ) ADNI.

(  A  ) Spatial similarity of the RSNs across the older-adult cohorts. (  B  ) Comparison of the spatial similarity of the RSNs identified in the CamCAN35\u2212 versus the ADNI and SALD cohorts and in the CamCAN55+ versus the ADNI and SALD cohorts. DMN, default mode network; SAL, salience network; ECN, executive control network; VIS, visual network; SMN, sensorimotor network. \n  \nThe choice of a reference atlas, CAREN or Yeo, minimally affected the spatial definition of the RSNs. The average spatial overlap of each RSN constructed based on CAREN versus each RSN constructed based on Yeo\u2019s atlas was 86% across the three cohorts (CamCAN: 86% (sd\u2009=\u200915%), SALD: 85% (19%), ADNI: 86% (9%);  ). \n\n\n### Comparison of the Major RSNs between Older- and Young Adults \n  \nWe found that the major RSNs in the CamCAN35\u2212 ( ) were less similar to those identified in the SALD and ADNI than in the CamCAN55+ (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u22124.2,   P  \u2009=\u20092.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ;  ). The SMN and VIS, which cover primary cortices differed the least, whereas the SAL network showed the largest spatial difference between the younger and older cohorts. \n\n\n### Atlas55+ \n  \nAtlas55+ is available at two resolution levels: at the lever of the five major RSNs (DMN, ECN, SAL, SMN, and VIS,  ) and at the level of their 15 subdivisions that were also reliably identified across the three older-adult cohorts ( ). The anatomical description of each RSN and their subdivisions is detailed in   and  . The degree of confidence in network assignment in Atlas55+ was high across the three older-adult cohorts ( ). The SMN and VIS were the most reproducible networks with 77% and 93% of their voxels, respectively being consistently assigned across all three cohorts. \n  \nAtlas55+: consensus brain atlas composed of the five major resting-state networks based on three cohorts of healthy individuals aged 55\u00a0years and above. (  A  ) Spatial map of the RSNs. (  B  ) Voxel-wise confidence map in Atlas55+. This measure quantifies the probability that a voxel in an Atlas55+ network is assigned to the same-label RSN in each of the three cohorts. DMN, default mode network; SAL, salience network; ECN, executive control network; VIS, visual network; SMN, sensorimotor network. \n    \nReliable subdivisions of each of the five major RSNs across the three older-adult cohorts. (  A  ) Four subdivisions of the DMN; (  B  ) four subdivisions of the ECN; (  C  ) one subdivision of the SAL; (  D  ) four subdivisions of the SMN; (  E  ) two subdivisions of the VIS. Each color corresponds to one subdivision. Each subdivision is further described in the supplementary material (  and  ). \n  \nAs defined in Atlas55+, the SMN was comprised of the sensory and motor regions (precentral and postcentral gyrus and supplementary motor area), the primary auditory cortex (superior temporal cortex), and thalamus. The SMN was further partitioned into four subdivisions: the ventral and dorsal parts of the pre- and postcentral gyri, the supplementary motor area and the bilateral superior temporal gyri (auditory network). The VIS network largely covered the occipital lobe, and was partitioned into two subdivisions: the medial and posterior parts ( ). Both SMN and VIS networks showed the largest spatial overlap with their respective networks in younger adults as outlined in CamCAN35\u2212 (spatial overlap: 69% and 84%, respectively;  ). \n  \nSpatial comparison of the major resting state networks between adults over the age of 55\u00a0years, as defined in Atlas55+, and younger adults (aged 18\u201335\u00a0years) from the CamCAN35\u2212 cohort. \n  \nFor the DMN, 51% of the network\u2019s voxels showed consistency across all three older-adult cohorts. In Atlas55+, the DMN comprised the medial prefrontal cortex/ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), the inferior frontal cortex, the angular gyri, the middle temporal cortex, the hippocampi and amygdala, and some bilateral cerebellar clusters. The DMN further included four reliable subdivisions comprising the anterior DMN (ACC), the core DMN (precuneus/PCC, medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral angular gyri), and two left lateralized networks mostly covering the inferior frontal gyrus, temporal poles and the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus, and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex ( ). The whole DMN showed a 63% overlap with the DMN in younger adults as defined in CamCAN35\u2212 ( ). The major spatial differences were localized in the posterior medial temporal lobe\u2014which was part of the DMN from CamCAN35\u2212, but not from Atlas55+ ( ). \n\nFor the ECN, 58% of the network\u2019s voxels showed consistency across all three older-adult cohorts. In Atlas55+, the ECN included parts of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the lateral and medial parietal cortex, the posterior inferior temporal cortex, the posterior parahippocampal gyrus and some bilateral cerebellar clusters. The ECN further included four reliable subnetworks comprising the right and left lateral parietal\u2013frontal cortex, as well as two posterior subdivisions mostly covering the posterior parietal lobe and the medial temporal lobe. The whole ECN showed a 60% overlap with the ECN in younger adults as defined in CamCAN35\u2212. The major differences involved the additions of the posterior medial temporal lobe (lingual and parahippocampal gyri) in the ECN from Atlas55+ ( ). \n\nThe SAL network emerged as the least reproducible network: 25% of the network\u2019s voxels were consistently assigned to the SAL across the three older-adult cohorts. In Atlas55+, the SAL was comprised of the anterior insula bilaterally, the dorsal ACC, the supramarginal gyri, subcortical regions including the putamen and thalamic nuclei, and bilateral cerebellar clusters. We only found one reliable subdivision which mostly covered the dorsal ACC and supramarginal gyri, bilaterally ( ). The spatial overlap with the whole SAL in younger adults as defined in CamCAN35\u2212 was the lowest with 30% and the regional differences were widespread ( ). \n\n\n### Associations of Sex and Age with the Spatial Distribution of the Major RSNs in Atlas55+ \n  \nSex  :   we did not find any significant differences between males and females on the spatial distribution of any major RSN in the atlas. \n\nAge  :   we found a negative regional association with age for each of the major RSNs in the atlas ( ,  ). In detail, increasing age was associated with lower spatial integrity of: (1) both anterior and posterior medial regions in the DMN ( ), (2) bilateral frontoparietal regions in the ECN ( ), (3) bilateral anterior insula and dorsal ACC in the SAL ( ), (4) bilateral superior temporal and postcentral gyri in the SMN ( ), and to a lesser degree (5) in the calcarine and lingual gyri of the VIS ( ). \n  \nClusters showing lower spatial integration with the rest of the RSN, with older age, across the three older-adult cohorts. Details of the clusters are in  . Significance set up at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 (FWE correction at the voxel level). \n  \nIn contrast, increasing age was associated with higher spatial integrity of cerebellar regions in both the DMN and the ECN ( ). No other results were significant. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study investigated (1) the spatial definition of the major RSNs in healthy individuals in late adulthood using rs-fMRI data from three large independent cohorts of participants aged 55\u00a0years and above and; (2) differences in the spatial definition of RSNs in late adulthood to those derived from healthy individuals in early adulthood. We found a high reproducibility of the spatial definition of the RSNs across the cohorts of older adults, but also significant differences when compared to the RSNs of younger adults. In response to these findings, we constructed Atlas55+, a robust brain functional atlas derived from rs-fMRI of 563 healthy adults between the ages of 55 and 95\u00a0years, in order to promote RSN reproducibility in future studies focusing on older populations. The age cutoff of 55\u00a0years may be considered arbitrary but there is currently no clear consensus on a specific age that distinguishes middle to late adulthood. In response, we followed the same age criterion as in ADNI, which is a landmark initiative in North America to investigate brain organization in older populations ( ;  ). \n\nDespite different MRI scanner types, acquisition parameters, and sites, we demonstrated good reproducibility of the spatial definition of the RSNs across the three older-adult cohorts. Regardless of the cohort, the regions with the highest spatial overlap between RSNs were localized in the medial prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the lateral parietal cortex, which have been described as brain hubs in young adults ( ;  ). Participation in multiple networks is thought to reflect an inherent feature of these associative regions ( ). Although studies have reported a negative effect of aging on the strength of these regional hubs ( ;  ), the current study suggests that the variability in their location remains relatively unaltered within older healthy populations. \n\nAcross the three older-adult cohorts, we found that the most reproducible networks were the SMN and VIS networks. These networks are mostly covering primary cortices, which are known to have high structural-functional coherence ( ), low interindividual variability in anatomical morphology ( ) and in resting-state functional connectivity ( ;  ;  ), and tend to preferentially participate in single networks in line with their circumscribed and specific functions ( ). In contrast, the SAL network showed the largest spatial differences across the three older-adult cohorts. This was consistent with the fact that we only identified one reliable subdivision of the SAL, in contrast to the other high-order RSNs (i.e., DMN and ECN) that showed four reliable subdivisions each. In studies of individuals below the age of 40\u00a0years, the spatial definition and role of the SAL network have been largely variable ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and this appears to be the case in older adults too. \n\nIn line with what we hypothesized, we found age-related alterations in the spatial composition of all five RSNs. The association of RSN spatial definition with age was examined in two different and complementary ways. First, by comparing RSNs between older and younger adults and second by examining the effect of age within the older age-group by testing its association with RSN constitution in the RSNs defined by Atlas55+. Comparison of younger and older adults showed that the SMN and VIS showed the smallest age-related differences, whereas the DMN, ECN and SAL showed the highest degree of age-related spatial reorganization. These findings accord with those of prior studies which have consistently reported that the functional connectivity within networks supporting higher order functions is more affected by age than that of networks supporting lower order functions ( ;  ;  ). Also, a recent study by  ) showed more extensive age-related changes in the structural-functional coherence of the associative cortex compared with that of the unimodal cortex. The posterior medial temporal regions\u2014which are typically identified as part of the DMN in younger adults ( ;  ;  )\u2014were instead assigned to the ECN in the older adults. This finding is in agreement with the notion that cognitive aging involves reorganization rather than loss of function ( ;  ;  ). This regional variability of the DMN and ECN is also supported by the \u201cthe default to executive coupling\u201d model of cognitive aging proposed by  ). This model proposes a regional shift in the architecture of the DMN and ECN to support crystallized cognition in later life ( ). We also found large spatial differences in the SAL between the younger and older adults, with the younger adults showing a more restricte network ( ). As discussed above, the origin of this large interindividual variability is unclear. Future investigations focusing on the SAL are needed to determine whether the spatial differences may be related to analytical or true biological differences between samples. \n\nWe found a significant association of age with the functional integrity of the major RSNs in older adults, particularly in the major regions of the DMN, ECN, and SAL. This finding was expected as the age range across all older participants was 40\u00a0years. This was consistent with prior neuroimaging studies that described an effect of aging on both brain structure and function in populations over age 50 ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The overall negative impact of age on each network largely confirms a reduction of functional cohesiveness of the major brain networks, particularly those supporting higher order cognitive functions ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). It is interesting to note that we also found a positive association of age in cerebellar regions in both the DMN and ECN, suggesting higher cerebellar-cortical integration in these two networks with older age.  ) reported similar findings of increased cerebellar-neocortical functional connectivity with age in healthy participants between the age of 12 and 79\u00a0years. This higher cerebellar-neocortical integration has also been associated with successful higher order cognitive activity in a healthy elderly population ( ). Collectively, the findings reported in the current study underscore the importance of age-adapted brain functional atlases. \n\nMoving forward, we propose Atlas55+ that has several advantages to study brain activity in late adulthood. To the best of our knowledge, Atlas55+ (1) is the only atlas based on rs-fMRI datasets from three independent cohorts including a total of 563 healthy participants above the age of 55\u00a0years; (2) includes functional partitions of the brain at the level of the large RSNs and their subdivisions; (3) accommodates differences in neuroimaging acquisition parameters (i.e., different sites, MRI scanners, and acquisition sequences); and (4) is independent of sample composition. We identified 15 reproducible RSN subdivisions ( ), which is in a typical range for subdivisions reported in brain functional atlases based on younger adults\u2019 rs-fMRI data ( ;  ). We note that the subdivisions reported were those that were identified in all three older-adult cohorts, to minimize potential influences by differences in MRI acquisition parameters. Further studies are needed to confidently identify the exact causes of variation in these subdivisions between the cohorts. \n\nAlthough Atlas55+ offers a realistic option for standardizing the definition of RSNs for older adults, we acknowledge its limitations. First, the age cutoff of 55\u00a0years follows the criterion used in ADNI, which can be viewed as arbitrary. Second, age-related changes in RSN configuration are likely to continue throughout late life and these subtle changes may not be fully captured by Atlas55+. The option of creating brain functional atlases in older individuals to cover specific and smaller time periods (i.e., for every decade past the 55th year) is challenging at present as high-quality rs-fMRI datasets are scarce in older participants, particularly in advanced old age. The Human Connectome Project-Aging dataset may help achieve this goal when it will be fully released ( ). Third, we constructed Atlas55+ using a volumetric-based (ICA) rather than a surface-based approach. We previously demonstrated that MICCA provided reliable networks ( ), and the analytic approach does not significantly alter the reproducibility of the RSNs as long as they are derived from a sample of at least 100 individuals ( ), which is the case for each cohort analyzed in the current study. Therefore, it is unlikely that this choice strongly influenced the spatial definition of the RSNs. Fourth, we focused on the five major RSNs (DMN, ECN, SAL, SMN, VIS) and their subdivisions as these are the most reproducible networks in the neuroimaging literature ( ;  ;  ). As aging is associated with reduced brain modularity ( ;  ;  ), we cannot exclude the possibility that the clustering approach did not influence the current findings ( ). However, each of these five RSNs have been consistently identified in aging studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), suggesting that their existence in older individuals is indisputable. Lastly, this study specifically focused on the spatial characteristics of the RSNs; other characteristics such as their dynamics or the association with cognitive variability in late adulthood were not explored because the necessary data were not available. In particular, it will be important to investigate the cognitive impact on the spatial definition of the Atlas55+ RSNs, in cognitively impaired populations. In the current study, all individuals were identified as healthy and showed very low variability in their general functioning (Mini-mental state exam score: mean (std): 28.6 (1.5), across the CamCAN55+ and ADNI cohorts) which prevented further analyses to identify spatial variability in the RSNs as a function of cognitive ability. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe presented a quantitative comparison of the spatial composition of the major RSNs and their reliable functional subdivisions derived from healthy adults between the ages of 55 and 95\u00a0years old and younger adults aged 18\u201335\u00a0years. We also identified the spatial distribution of age-related changes in RSN definition. Our results confirm the importance of age-appropriate brain functional atlases for studies investigating brain mechanisms related to aging. We propose that Atlas55+ can provide a reproducible template of the major RSNs for late adulthood as it is publicly available ( ). \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7869083, "text_md5": "b405ae82ac7d64fd6a5f0b8da51fa2c3", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 105], "journal": [106, 118], "publication_year": [120, 124], "title": [135, 212], "keywords": [226, 293], "abstract": [306, 1766], "body": [1775, 38435]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 33188411, "doi": "10.1093/cercor/bhaa321", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7869083", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7869083"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7869083\">7869083</a>", "list_title": "PMC7869083  Atlas55+: Brain Functional Atlas of Resting-State Networks for Late Adulthood"}
