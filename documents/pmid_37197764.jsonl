Numerous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) studies have provided strong evidence of abnormalities in the structure and intrinsic function of brain regions in MCI. Studies have recently begun to explore their association but have not employed systematic information in this pursuit. Herein, a multimodal meta-analysis was performed, which included 43 VBM datasets (1,247 patients and 1,352 controls) of gray matter volume (GMV) and 42 rs-fMRI datasets (1,468 patients and 1,605 controls) that combined 3 metrics: amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, and regional homogeneity. Compared to controls, patients with MCI displayed convergent reduced regional GMV and altered intrinsic activity, mainly in the default mode network and salience network. Decreased GMV alone in ventral medial prefrontal cortex and altered intrinsic function alone in bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate/paracingulate gyri, right lingual gyrus, and cerebellum were identified, respectively. This meta-analysis investigated complex patterns of convergent and distinct brain alterations impacting different neural networks in MCI patients, which contributes to a further understanding of the pathophysiology of MCI.
