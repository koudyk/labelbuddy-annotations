Its prevalence increases with age, especially advanced age (Louis & Ferreira,\u00a0 ), and it shows marked clinical, pathological, and etiological heterogeneity (Bhatia et al.,\u00a0 ; Louis,\u00a0 ). The pathogenesis of ET involves genetic and environmental factors (Hopfner & Helmich,\u00a0 ), and neuropathological investigation has focused on the cerebellum and cerebellar relays (Louis,\u00a0 ). Given the high prevalence of phenocopies, the lack of reliable biomarkers in ET hampers diagnosis (Espay et al.,\u00a0 ; Hopfner & Deuschl,\u00a0 ). It is hoped that a better understanding of its neuropathology will help differentiate discrete causes of the disorder, with clinical biomarkers available to separate the subgroups. \n\nNeuroimaging approaches have the potential to define brain structure and function abnormalities in ET (Bhalsing, Saini, & Pal,\u00a0 ). In particular, resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs\u2010fMRI), a well\u2010established and practical tool for investigating intrinsic brain activity (Raichle & Mintun,\u00a0 ), has provided valuable insights into the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders (Gusnard & Raichle,\u00a0 ). In fMRI methods, the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal indirectly reflects neuronal activity. Compared to task\u2010related fMRI, rs\u2010fMRI has the practical advantage of minimizing the influences of compliance and task performance. There are several approaches to analyze spontaneous BOLD signals in rs\u2010fMRI: amplitude of low frequency oscillations (ALFF) assesses the regional intensity of signal fluctuations; regional homogeneity (ReHo) examines similarities between the signals from nearby voxels; other approaches include independent component analysis (ICA) and four\u2010dimensional (spatiotemporal) consistency of local neural activity (FOCA). A different imaging approach uses the radiotracer techniques of positron emission tomography (PET) or single\u2010photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) or glucose metabolism (rCMglu), which also reflect neuronal activity (Cerasa & Quattrone,\u00a0 ; Sharifi, Nederveen, Booij, & Rootselaar,\u00a0 ). \n\nAlthough resting\u2010state brain studies in ET have revealed abnormal patterns of spontaneous activity in cerebello\u2010thalamo\u2010cortical circuitry (Fang et al.,\u00a0 ; Gallea et al.,\u00a0 ; Pelzer et al.,\u00a0 ), the results have been variable and inconsistent. For example, one study in ET patients reported decreased cerebellar activity (Fang et al.,\u00a0 ), another reported increased cerebellar activity (Li et al.,\u00a0 ), and another found no cerebellar changes (P. Wang et al.,\u00a0 ). These differences may be ascribed to study differences in sample sizes, demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, and image acquisition and analysis protocols. Even though early systematic reviews in ET usefully summarized functional neuroimaging findings (Bhalsing et al.,\u00a0 ; Sharifi et al.,\u00a0 ), there has not yet been a quantitative meta\u2010analysis of whole\u2010brain resting\u2010state neuroimaging studies in ET. This is what we set out to do. The emphasis on whole\u2010brain studies is methodologically important: seed\u2010based and region\u2010of\u2010interest (ROI) studies entail a selection bias in the seed or ROI definition, lack ability to test equally for effects in other brain regions, and use a much lower significance threshold. Therefore, as recommended, we limited meta\u2010analysis to the results of whole\u2010brain analysis (M\u00fcller et al.,\u00a0 ). Because there are few functional connectivity studies, and methods vary widely between them, this dimension of brain activity was not examined. \n\nThe primary aim of the current meta\u2010analysis was to identify consistent and reliable functional brain alterations in ET by integrating all eligible studies reporting resting\u2010state brain activity. We used anisotropic effect size\u2010signed differential mapping (AES\u2010SDM), a coordinate\u2010based meta\u2010analytic tool (Radua, Mataix\u2010Cols, et al.,\u00a0 ) which has been widely applied in neuroimaging studies of neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease (Pan et al.,\u00a0 ; J. Wang, Zhang, Zang, & Wu,\u00a0 ; Suo et al.  ) and Alzheimer's disease (Jacobs, Radua, Luckmann, & Sack,\u00a0 ). The second aim was to perform subgroup meta\u2010analyses addressing the effects of two important clinical factors, namely medication status and the presence of head tremor, and two methodological factors, the statistical correction threshold employed in studies and the imaging technique used. The third aim was to perform meta\u2010regression analyses to examine the effects of specific clinical/methodological characteristics, namely age of patients, age at onset, illness duration, and severity and statistical correction for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Literature search \n  \nA comprehensive computerized search was performed in the databases PubMed, Web of Science and Embase using the following key words ALFF <or> ReHo <or> rCBF <or> rCMRglu <or> ASL <or> amplitude of low frequency fluctuations <or> low frequency fluctuations <or> regional homogeneity <or> regional cerebral blood flow <or> regional cerebral metabolic <or> arterial spin labeling <or> PET <or> positron emission tomography <or> SPECT <or> single photon emission computed tomography <or> neuroimaging; ET <or> essential tremor; resting\u2010state <or> rest <or> resting, covering the period from July 1993 to February 2021. Manual searches were also conducted within the reference lists of identified and review articles. Studies were included according to the following inclusion criteria: (a) employing at least one of fMRI, ASL, PET, or SPECT in the resting state; (b) reporting comparisons of ET patients with healthy controls (HC); (c) including coordinates of the activation areas in stereotactic space (Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute space); (d) using significance thresholds that were either corrected for multiple comparisons or uncorrected with spatial extent thresholds. Where articles reported multiple independent patient samples, the appropriate coordinates were included as separate studies. Where multiple articles were identified as using overlapping patient datasets, the one with the largest sample and the most comprehensive information was selected. Studies were excluded if (a) stereotactic coordinates of the reported changes in the whole brain were not obtainable; (b) analysis was limited to specific ROI or used seed\u2010voxel\u2010based analysis procedures; or (c) studies were case reports, letters, meta\u2010analysis, or reviews. The study selection procedures are summarized in Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nFlowchart of literature search and selection criteria \n  \n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nThe quality of each selected study was independently assessed by two authors using a 10\u2010point checklist adapted from previous meta\u2010analyses (T. Wang et al.,\u00a0 ). The assessment included the quality of the diagnostic procedures, demographic and clinical characterization, sample size, analysis method and quality of reported results. Each item received a score of 1, 0.5, or 0 according to whether criteria were fully, partially, or not met, respectively. This checklist was used to evaluate the completeness of published studies and provide some objective indication of the rigor of individual studies (see Tables\u00a0  and S2). \n\n\n### Meta\u2010analysis \n  \nA voxel\u2010based meta\u2010analytic approach was conducted using the AES\u2010SDM software package ( ) to analyze regional group differences in brain activity during the resting state. Data extracted from studies included peak coordinates of regions where there were statistically significant group differences at the whole\u2010brain level, and   t  \u2010values or their equivalents (  Z  \u2010 or   p  \u2010values, which were converted to   t  \u2010statistics using the SDM online converter [ ]). If no effect size (  t\u2010  ,   Z\u2010  , or   p  \u2010value) was reported, then a \u201cp\u201d was recorded for positive peaks, and \u201cn\u201d for negative peaks. By combining the reported peak coordinates and statistical parameters, AES\u2010SDM recreates maps of the effect size of group differences in brain activity, calculating both positive and negative differences between groups. Findings of studies that reported no group difference were recreated with anisotropic effect size and variance maps as in any other study, but all voxels were deemed to have a null anisotropic effect size; these were included in the meta\u2010analysis as usual, thus contributing to the overall meta\u2010analytic anisotropic effect size. Thresholds were applied (voxel threshold:   p  \u2009\u2264\u2009.005, and peak height threshold: peak   Z  \u2009\u2265\u20091.000) after calculating the meta\u2010analytic means, with a cluster extent of   k  \u2009>\u2009100. Additional analyses offered by SDM, jackknife, subgroup, and meta\u2010regression analyses, were used to evaluate the robustness and heterogeneity of results as described below. \n\n\n### Jackknife sensitivity analysis \n  \nA systematic whole\u2010brain voxel\u2010based jackknife sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the results. The approach is to repeat the analysis over and over, discarding a different study each time. A result is considered replicable if identified alterations in a brain area remain significant in all or most combinations of studies (Radua, Borgwardt, et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Subgroup analysis \n  \nSubgroup analyses were performed to both establish consistency of findings and to ascertain clinical and methodological factors associated with divergent findings. Clinical features of primary interest were studies reporting medication\u2010na\u00efve and patients with head tremor; methodological features of interest were the use of correction of statistical thresholds for multiple hypothesis testing and studies using fMRI. \n\n\n### Heterogeneity analysis and publication bias \n  \nAn inter\u2010study heterogeneity map was created to identify brain regions in which study findings were more heterogeneous. We examined the statistical (between\u2010studies) heterogeneity of individual clusters using a random\u2010effects model with Q statistics, and tested for significance with a permutation approach (uncorrected   p  \u2009<\u2009.005). For each cluster with significant ET versus HC differences, we also assessed the asymmetry of funnel plots to examine the possibility of publication bias using the Egger test (Radua et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Meta\u2010regression analysis \n  \nFinally, meta\u2010regression analysis was carried out to investigate the potential effects of relevant demographic, clinical, and methodological variables on group differences: mean age, percent of male patients, age at onset, illness duration, Mini\u2010Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, the illness severity reflected by Fahn\u2013Tolosa\u2013Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTM\u2010TRS) score, and statistical correction for multiple comparisons. Data on these variables were extracted from each included study and a more conservative threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.0005 was adopted to minimize the detection of spurious relationships, and to discard findings in regions other than those detected in the main analyses (Radua, Borgwardt, et al.,\u00a0 ; Radua & Mataix\u2010Cols,\u00a0 ). Finally, regression plots were visually inspected to discard effects driven by too few studies. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Studies included and sample characteristics \n  \nFigure\u00a0  provides a flow diagram showing the screening and selection of studies. A total of 14 datasets from 13 studies (Benito\u2010Le\u00f3n et al.,\u00a0 ; Czarnecki, Jones, Burnett, Mullan, & Matsumoto,\u00a0 ; Fang et al.,\u00a0 ; Fang et al.,\u00a0 ; Ha et al.,\u00a0 ; Jenkins et al.,\u00a0 ; Li et al.,\u00a0 ; Song, Park, Chung, & Chung,\u00a0 ; L. Wang et al.,\u00a0 ; P. Wang et al.,\u00a0 ; P. Wang, Luo, et al.,\u00a0 ; Wills, Jenkins, Thompson, Findley, & Brooks,\u00a0 ; Yin, Lin, Li, Qian, & Mou,\u00a0 ) reported 286 patients with ET (mean age 45.0\u201367.4\u2009years) and 254 HC (mean age 44.4\u201366.9\u2009years). One of these studies reported multiple independent patient samples (L. Wang, Lei, et al.,\u00a0 ), comparing ALFF abnormalities in ET patients with and without head tremor with that of HC. One contributed no coordinates as no significant between\u2010group differences in ALFF were found (P. Wang et al.,\u00a0 ). Two separate studies used overlapping samples, so we included the studies with the largest sample (Li et al.,\u00a0 ; Song et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nTable\u00a0  summarizes the demographic and clinical characteristics of participants in each study, as well as the neuroimaging methodology used. Of the 13 included studies, eight used fMRI methodology (one with ReHo analysis, four ALFF, two ICA, and one FOCA), four studies used PET or SPECT measurements of rCBF, and one study (Ha et al.,\u00a0 ) used PET/rCMRglu. The quality scores, ranging from 7.5 to 10 (mean 9.4), show that the included studies were of high quality. \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of participants in the 13 included studies (14 datasets) \n    \n\n### Pooled meta\u2010analysis \n  \nIn the pooled meta\u2010analysis of all included studies, ET patients showed increased resting\u2010state activity compared to HC in right postcentral gyrus (PoCG) extending anteriorly to include motor cortex and right precentral gyrus (PreCG), and posteriorly to inferior parietal gyri, right superior frontal gyrus (SFG, medial part), and left precentral gyrus (PreCG). ET patients showed decreased activity compared to HC in left cerebellum (including hemispheric lobule IV/V) and bilateral insula (Table\u00a0 , Figure\u00a0 ). Because only one study measured cerebral glucose metabolism (Ha et al.,\u00a0 ), we repeated the meta\u2010analysis without it: the results were unchanged, except that the SFG cluster shifted inferiorly to the inferior frontal gyrus in the ET\u2009>\u2009HC comparison ( ). \n  \nMeta\u2010analysis results of differences in resting state brain activity between ET and HC \n      \nRegions of increased (red color) and decreased (blue color) resting\u2010state brain activity in patients with essential tremor compared to healthy controls in the pooled meta\u2010analysis. L, left; PoCG, postcentral gyrus; PreCG, precentral gyrus; R, right; SFG, superior frontal gyrus \n  \n\n### Subgroup meta\u2010analyses \n  \nThe results of the subgroup meta\u2010analyses are presented in the  . \n\nThe subgroup analysis of patients with head tremor included seven datasets comprising 189 ET patients and 180 HC ( ). The results shared four clusters with the results of the pooled meta\u2010analysis, including increased activity in right PoCG and left PreCG, and decreased activity in the cerebellum and insula. These results are broadly consistent with the main findings. So too were the results of the subgroup meta\u2010analyses in studies of medication\u2010na\u00efve patients, studies using threshold correction and fMRI studies ( ). In addition, we noted decreased activity in cerebellar lobule VI in the subgroup analyses of patients with head tremor and medication\u2010na\u00efve, respectively. \n\n\n### Jackknife sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias analysis \n  \nIn a whole\u2010brain jack\u2010knife sensitivity analysis of ET versus HC (Table\u00a0 ), the findings of increased functional activity in right PoCG of ET patients were highly replicable, being preserved in all combinations of the datasets. Similarly, decreased functional activity in left cerebellum was significant in all but one combination (Fang et al.,\u00a0 ). Increased functional activity in left PreCG was significant in all but two combinations (Fang et al.,\u00a0 ; Song et al.,\u00a0 ). Increased functional activity in right SFG and decreased activity in left insula remained significant in all but three combinations. The results of the pooled meta\u2010analysis thus showed high replicability and reliability in these regions. The same pattern was seen in all subgroup meta\u2010analyses ( ). \n  \nResults of the jackknife sensitivity analysis (No. of datasets: 14) \n    \nIn the pooled meta\u2010analysis, no regions with altered resting\u2010state functional activity showed significant between\u2010study heterogeneity. Egger's test was nonsignificant (  p  \u2009>\u2009.05 for all comparisons, Table\u00a0 ), suggesting that there was no publication bias in any cluster. \n\n\n### Meta\u2010regression analysis \n  \nIn regression analyses we examined mean age (available in all studies), percent of male patients (available in all studies), age at onset (available in nine studies), illness duration (available in all but one study), MMSE (available in six studies), and illness severity (available in seven studies): none of these were significantly associated with brain activity measures. We note that linear not nonlinear models were used due to the small sample sizes. In addition, effects in studies using statistical threshold correction did not differ significantly from studies reporting findings with an uncorrected threshold. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nWe used AES\u2010SDM software to perform a comprehensive coordinate\u2010based meta\u2010analysis in order to identify the most consistent and reliable alterations in resting\u2010state brain activity in ET compared with HC. We found   increased   activity in the right PoCG extending anteriorly to right PreCG and posteriorly to inferior parietal gyri, left PreCG, right SFG, and   decreased   activity in the left cerebellar hemisphere (lobule IV/V) and bilateral insula. In the subgroup meta\u2010analyses,   decreased   activity in cerebellar lobule VI was confirmed in ET patients with head tremor and medication\u2010na\u00efve subjects. We found no significant correlations with clinical variables. \n\n### The main abnormalities and their potential significance \n  \nOur finding of   decreased   left cerebellar hemisphere activity accords with other evidence of cerebellar pathology in ET: these include postmortem findings of cell loss and axon swelling in cerebellar Purkinje cells (Lin et al.,\u00a0 ),  H magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings of decreased cerebellar N\u2010acetylaspartate/creatine, taken as an index of neuronal degeneration (Louis et al.,\u00a0 ), and other changes including histopathology (Louis, Faust, & Vonsattel,\u00a0 ), electrophysiology (Hellwig et al.,\u00a0 ), clinical (Louis, Frucht, & Rios,\u00a0 ), neuroimaging (Cerasa & Quattrone,\u00a0 ; Raethjen & Deuschl,\u00a0 ) and therapeutic effects (Popa et al.,\u00a0 ). A recent study on the structural correlates of the sensorimotor cerebellum in PD and ET points to sensorimotor lobules IV and V as particularly relevant to tremor symptoms (Lopez et al.,\u00a0 ), and here we also found decreased functional activity in that region. Moreover, the subgroup meta\u2010analysis of patients with head tremor and medication\u2010na\u00efve patients revealed decreased activity in the cerebellar hemisphere lobule VI. Lobule VI has been linked to upper extremity somatomotor function, as well as affective and cognitive function (Stoodley & Schmahmann,\u00a0 ). As head tremor is often accompanied by upper limb tremor (Louis,\u00a0 ), we speculate that abnormal activity of cerebellar lobule VI may contribute to head tremor and perhaps also upper extremity tremor in untreated ET. Future investigations using an ROI approach are needed to explore the specific functions of the different cerebellar regions in ET. \n\nWe found significantly   increased   activity in sensorimotor cortex, including PreCG and PoCG. Electrophysiological studies have identified the motor cortex as an important source of both voluntary physiological movements and involuntary pathological movements, including tremor in ET patients (Raethjen & Deuschl,\u00a0 ). Furthermore, the tremor of ET patients can be reduced by subdural stimulation of the motor cortex (Moro et al.,\u00a0 ). Previous neuroimaging findings of motor cortex in ET include increased functional connectivity between thalamus and motor cortex (Fang et al.,\u00a0 ), abnormal functional activity in sensorimotor cortex and inferior parietal lobule (Archer et al.,\u00a0 ), and a variety of structural MRI abnormalities related to motor symptoms (Caligiuri et al.,\u00a0 ; Louis,\u00a0 ; Raethjen, Govindan, Kopper, Muthuraman, & Deuschl,\u00a0 ). \n\nA popular theory of ET pathophysiology involves the cerebello\u2010thalamo\u2010cortical network, known as the tremor network (Sharifi et al.,\u00a0 ). Our finding of abnormalities in the cerebellum and sensorimotor cortex are consistent with this theory, and with a recent network\u2010level connectivity study in ET patients that found abnormal functional connectivity between sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum (DeSimone, Archer, Vaillancourt, & Wagle Shukla,\u00a0 ). Notably, we observed   decreased   activity in cerebellar hemispheres and   increased   activity in cerebral cortex. A similar pattern has been seen in task\u2010based fMRI in ET (Neely et al.,\u00a0 ). It has been suggested that increased cerebral motor cortex activity may represent a compensation for cerebellar degenerative changes in ET (Yin et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nInterestingly, our meta\u2010analysis did not reveal abnormal activity in the thalamus. This relay station for reciprocal projections from cerebellum to cerebral cortex plays an important role in the motor symptoms of ET (Bhalsing et al.,\u00a0 ; Bucher, Seelos, Dodel, Reiser, & Oertel,\u00a0 ; Jenkins et al.,\u00a0 ; Louis & Ferreira,\u00a0 ). Also, stereotactic surgery of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus is an effective treatment for ET (Flora, Perera, Cameron, & Maddern,  ). Our overall negative finding has several possible explanations. First, only 4 of the 13 studies included in our meta\u2010analysis reported changes in this region (Fang et al.,\u00a0 ; L. Wang, Lei, et al.,\u00a0 ; P. Wang, Luo, et al.,\u00a0 ; Wills et al.,\u00a0 ). Second, there is heterogeneity in the exact location and alterations in different studies: one study reported   decreased   activity in the mediodorsal and ventral intermediate nuclei (Fang et al.,\u00a0 ), while another reported   increased   activity in this region (L. Wang, Lei, et al.,\u00a0 ). The thalamus is heterogeneous in structure and function, and the resolution of typical resting\u2010state fMRI studies especially when considered in a meta\u2010analytic framework may not be sufficient to parse effects that may differ across nuclei. Third, it is noteworthy that intraoperative microelectrode recording does not reveal thalamic activity related to tremor at rest (Hua & Lenz,\u00a0 ), suggesting that resting alterations of thalamic neural activity may be restricted to specific nuclei, or more modest than in neocortex and cerebellum. \n\nWe found widespread alterations of activity in ET relative to HC in the nonmotor cortices including right SFG (medial) and bilateral insula. These belong to the DMN and limbic system (Roxo, Franceschini, Zubaran, Kleber, & Sander,\u00a0 ; Smith et al.,\u00a0 ), whose dysfunction may lead to various nonmotor symptoms such as cognitive impairment, anxiety and depression that have been associated with ET (Coste, Sadaghiani, Friston, & Kleinschmidt,\u00a0 ; Smith et al.,\u00a0 ). In particular, prefrontal cortex plays a vital role in controlling cognitive processes (Rossi, Pessoa, Desimone, & Ungerleider,  ), and the insula is also important for a variety of aspects of emotion and cognition (Nagai, Kishi, & Kato,\u00a0 ). In line with our findings, task\u2010based fMRI studies using the Stroop test and working memory paradigms have revealed increased activation of the prefrontal cortex in ET (Cerasa et al.,\u00a0 ; Passamonti et al.,\u00a0 ). A diffusion tensor imaging study in ET found that abnormal projections of the insula were significantly related to memory and executive function (Sengul et al.,\u00a0 ). Thus, regional activity changes in medial frontal cortex and insula may be related to emotional and cognitive dysfunction in patients with ET. It is important to note that patients in our study did not have frank dementia (MMSE score >24), so these findings outside the motor systems are not dementia\u2010related, but still be sufficient to contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in ET patients. The relations of alterations in motor cortex and heteromodal association cortex remain to be understood in mechanistic terms, and developing understanding of how ET induces clinically relevant functional alterations in higher brain functions remains an important research direction. \n\n\n### Implications of negative findings in meta\u2010regression analysis \n  \nAlthough no significant correlations were found between clinical variables and brain findings, several factors may potentially impact brain activity, among which illness duration and severity were of particular interest. In the three studies reporting brain activity changes in relation to illness duration and severity, the results vary widely and were too inconsistent to yield a significant effect. Due to the small sample size and heterogeneity of patients with respect to medication, family history and tremor features, our meta\u2010regression may have lacked sufficient power to detect such effects. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nThis meta\u2010analysis has certain limitations. First, like previous meta\u2010analyses (Amad, Radua, Vaiva, Williams, & Fovet,\u00a0 ; Koch et al.,\u00a0 ; Kuhn & Gallinat,\u00a0 ), we included studies using different neuroimaging methods as long as they were focused on brain activity, in order to provide the most comprehensive overview of resting\u2010state abnormalities in ET. All included methods reflect intrinsic neural activity, but their different physiological bases and underpinning assumptions may affect the meta\u2010analysis (Amad et al.,\u00a0 ). To address this issue, we performed a meta\u2010analysis including only the fMRI methodological subgroup (which was large enough for separate analysis). The results were much the same as the main analysis. Second, the number of studies (  N  \u00a0=\u00a013) and their sample size were relatively small. Although we employed jackknife sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness and reliability of the results, caution is necessary in interpretation. Third, despite providing an optimal balance between sensitivity and false positive rate (Pico\u2010Perez et al.,\u00a0 ), the default AES\u2010SDM statistical thresholds based on uncorrected P\u2010values and the inclusion of studies with uncorrected statistical thresholds may bias the results. However, in the present study, meta\u2010regression analyses showed that uncorrected thresholds did not significantly affect identified abnormalities. Fourth, coordinate\u2010based meta\u2010analysis summarizes reported coordinates instead of working with the original data, which may affect the precision and accuracy of identified spatial location of group differences (Salimi\u2010Khorshidi, Smith, Keltner, Wager, & Nichols,\u00a0 ). Finally, excluding studies that did not report stereotactic coordinates may bias findings in unclear ways. \n\nAs is always the case for meta\u2010analyses, it is possible that as more case\u2013control studies are published in the future, more spatially refined findings and perhaps new findings in additional brain areas may be identified. Also, longitudinal studies that investigate the development of brain activity changes and their relationship to cognitive function will help advance understanding of ET neuropathology as it evolves over time and impacts heteromodal neocortical regions. High resolution functional studies of thalamus, focused on both specific nuclei and relations with cerebellar and neocortical function, would be helpful for understanding circuit level pathology. Future research is needed to determine whether medication therapies alter brain function in a clinically relevant way. Studies might also examine relations to tremor severity (using kinesiological measures of tremor amplitude and frequency), more extensively evaluate neuropsychological functions, and implement multimodal imaging methods to more fully define the pathology of ET. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nThis was the first comprehensive meta\u2010analysis in ET that defined whole\u2010brain activity alterations, considering 13 published resting\u2010state functional brain imaging studies. We confirmed that alterations are not only present in the cerebellum and cerebral motor cortex, but also in certain nonmotor cortices including prefrontal cortex and insula. These effects beyond motor systems may contribute to nonmotor neuropsychiatric alterations in ET patients. Clarifying the causes and functional effects of alterations outside motor systems remains an important direction for future studies. These findings have potentially important implications for the systems\u2010level pathophysiology of ET and their broader neurobehavioral significance. Of note, this study adds to the field of psychoradiology (Sun et al.,  ; Huang et al.,  ; Gong,  ), an evolving subspecialty of radiology, which is primed to be of major clinical importance in guiding diagnostic and therapeutic decision making in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTERESTS \n  \nDr. Sweeney is a consultant for VersSci.
