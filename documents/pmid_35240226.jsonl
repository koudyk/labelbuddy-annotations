A meta-analytic review of whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in individuals with genetic risk or CHR-P or CHR-B and controls identified 94 datasets (N\u00a0=\u00a07942). Notwithstanding no significant findings were observed following adjustment for multiple comparisons, several findings were noted at a more liberal threshold. Subjects at genetic risk for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder or at CHR-P exhibited lower gray matter (GM) volumes in the gyrus rectus (Hedges' g\u00a0=\u00a0-0.19). Genetic risk for psychosis was associated with GM reductions in the right cerebellum and left amygdala. CHR-P was associated with decreased GM volumes in the frontal superior gyrus and hypoactivation in the right precuneus, the superior frontal gyrus and the right inferior frontal gyrus. Genetic and CHR-P were associated with small structural and functional alterations involving regions implicated in psychosis. Further neuroimaging studies in individuals with genetic or CHR-B are warranted.
