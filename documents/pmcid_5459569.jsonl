Though there has been extensive research investigating the true spatial scale of the orientation specific signals (Op de Beeck, 2010; Swisher et al., 2010; Alink et al., 2013; Freeman et al., 2011, 2013)  ,  ,  ,  ,  , it remained inconclusive what spatial acquisition resolution is required, or is optimal, for decoding analyses. The research article entitled \u201cThe effect of acquisition resolution on orientation decoding from V1 BOLD fMRI at 7\u00a0T\u201d Sengupta et al. (2017)   studied the effect of spatial acquisition resolution and also analyzed the strength and spatial scale of orientation discriminating signals. In this article, for the first time, we present empirical ultra high-field fMRI data, obtained as a part of the aforementioned study, which were recorded at four spatial resolutions (0.8\u00a0mm, 1.4\u00a0mm, 2\u00a0mm, and 3\u00a0mm isotropic voxel size) for orientation decoding in visual cortex. The dataset is compliant with the   BIDS   (Brain Imaging Data Structure) format, and freely available from the   OpenfMRI   portal (dataset accession number:   ds000113c). \n \n\n# Body\n \n Specifications Table  \n\n  \n\n Value of the data  \n\n  \nFirst publicly available dataset to provide ultra high-field, multi-resolution BOLD fMRI data for a uniform stimulation paradigm targeting the representation of visual orientations in early visual cortex. \n  \nExtension of the \u2329 \u232a dataset with a large amount of auxiliary data for all scanned participants, such as T1, T2, and SWI data for tissue segmentation and blood vessel locations, as well as several additional visual and auditory stimulation paradigms including a retinotopic mapping, and two natural movie stimuli. \n  \nCompliant with the brain imaging data structure (BIDS) standard, hence highly suitable for automated processing. \n  \nPotent dataset for optimization and benchmarking of algorithms, such as pattern classification and feature extraction. \n  \nFlexible and unrestricted data access down to the level of individual files facilitate cloud-based analysis and utilization in (web-based) demonstrations. \n  \n\n## Data \n  \nThe dataset of this article was being collected as a part of  , in which the effect of acquisition resolution on orientation decoding from primary visual cortex and the strength and the true spatial scale of decoding signals were analyzed. This dataset is published publicly in compliance with Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) specification  . All participants recruited in this study previously participated in   the studyforrest project   ( ,  ,  . The T1, T2, SWI structural images and the fMRI dataset for retinotopic mapping, which are available from  , have also been utilized in this study. This section provides information about the released data, but limits its description to aspects that extends the BIDS specifications. All files related to the data acquisitions for a particular participant (described in  ) can be located in a sub-<ID>/ses-r<RES>/ directory, where ID is the numeric subject code, and RES is a two-digit acquisition resolution identifier.   \nDescription of the files in the dataset containing acquired data and associated meta-data for a particular participant. \n  Table 1   \n\nIn order to anonymize the data, information on center-specific study and subject codes have been removed using an automated procedure described in  . All human participants were given integer IDs that are consistent across all other data releases of the   studyforrest   project  . \n\n\n## Experimental design, materials and methods \n  \nFunctional MRI data were recorded from seven healthy volunteers (age 21\u201338 years, 5 males) with normal or corrected to normal vision. The experiment had an event related design with each trial consisting of 3\u00a0s of flickering grating display and 5\u00a0s of medium gray. The random phase shifted sine wave gratings (0.8\u20137.6\u00b0 eccentricity, 100% contrast, spatial frequency of 1.4 cycles per degree of visual angle, 125\u00a0ms ON/OFF period) were independently oriented at either 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, or 135\u00b0. There were 30 such trials in an experimental run. For every session 10 runs were acquired. For additional details on the procedures please refer to  . \n\n### Functional imaging \n  \nThe participants were scanned using a 7\u00a0T whole body scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and a 32 receive channel head coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA). T2*-weighted echo planar images (EPI) (TR/TE=2000/22\u00a0ms, FA=90\u00b0) with the coverage of the primary visual cortex (parallel to the calcarine sulcus on a tilted axial plane), were acquired for 4 different spatial resolutions in individual scanning sessions. In each scanning session 10 separate scans (one for each experimental run consisting of 121 dynamics) were performed on each subject. In order to position the field-of-view to the same volume in each scan for each subject,   Siemens AutoAlign Head LS   system was used  . The data acquired in all scans were distortion corrected ( ). The functional acquisition parameters used in this experiment are described in  .   \nfMRI acquisition parameters used in this experiment. All EPI scans implemented ascending slice acquisition order and used a 10% inter-slice gap to minimize cross-slice excitation. \n  Table 2   \n\nThe 0.8\u00a0mm acquisition had a small coverage and in order to aid corresponding co-registration with the structural image, an additional EPI acquisition was performed that used the same auto-alignment procedure. The details of the acquisition and the co-registration procedure is described in  . \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5459569, "text_md5": "66cf09a55cd611de992d98534d07286f", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 91], "journal": [92, 102], "publication_year": [104, 108], "title": [119, 210], "keywords": [224, 224], "abstract": [237, 1542], "body": [1551, 5987]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 28616455, "doi": "10.1016/j.dib.2017.05.014", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5459569", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5459569"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5459569\">5459569</a>", "list_title": "PMC5459569  Ultra high-field (7\u00a0T) multi-resolution fMRI data for orientation decoding in visual cortex"}
