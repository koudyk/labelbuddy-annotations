Thus, the present study examined how neural responses to portion size relate to changes in weight and energy consumed as portions increase. Associations were examined across brain regions traditionally implicated in appetite control (i.e., an appetitive network) as well as the cerebellum, which has recently been implicated in appetite-related processes. Children without obesity (i.e., BMI-for-age-and-sex percentile < 90; N = 63; 55% female) viewed images of larger and smaller portions of food during fMRI and, in separate sessions, ate four meals that varied in portion size. Individual-level linear and quadratic associations between intake (kcal, grams) and portion size (i.e., portion size slopes) were estimated. The response to portion size in cerebellar lobules IV\u2013VI was associated with the quadratic portion size slope estimated from gram intake; a greater response to images depicting smaller compared to larger portions was associated with steeper increases in intake with increasing portion sizes. Within the appetitive network, neural responses were not associated with portion size slopes. A decreased cerebellar response to larger amounts of food may increase children\u2019s susceptibility to overeating when excessively large portions are served. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nServing larger portions of food increases intake across a variety of food types [ ] and environmental settings [ , ]. The tendency to consume more food in terms of weight and energy when exposed to larger portions (i.e., \u201cthe portion size effect\u201d\u2014PSE) emerges as early as infancy [ ] and is evident across the lifespan [ ]. The PSE is persistent up to five days with no compensation evident in children, leading to sustained increases in energy intake [ ]. As excess energy intake is associated with the development of obesity and long-term health risks [ , ], it is important to understand the neurobiological mechanisms that underly this behavior. \n\nThe control of eating behavior involves a network of cortical (e.g., prefrontal cortex, insula) and subcortical (e.g., basal ganglia, amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus) regions that integrate exteroceptive signals (e.g., visual portion size cues) with interoceptive signals from the gut and periphery [ , ]. This network contributes to a range of processes relevant for appetitive behavior, including energy homeostasis, perception, reward responsiveness, learning, memory, cognitive regulation, and interoception [ , , ]. The presentation of visual food cues (e.g., images) elicits patterns of neural engagement across the appetitive network [ ] that are associated with eating behaviors in both children [ , ] and adults [ , , ]. For example, prior analyses from our group [ ] found that greater activation to images of larger (vs. smaller) portions of food in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was positively associated with children\u2019s food intake in response to larger food portions, whereas the opposite relationship was observed in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). These data suggest that susceptibility to the PSE is associated with neural responses to food portion size cues in brain regions implicated in valuation (e.g., OFC, vmPFC) and cognitive control (e.g., IFG). Nevertheless, these analyses only examined neural responses in a limited number (n = 9) of regions using a region-of-interest-based approach; thus, a more comprehensive voxel-wise examination of the appetitive network is needed to identify regions sensitive to the PSE. \n\nAlthough the cerebellum is typically excluded or minimally integrated into models of eating behavior [ , , , ], it is involved in many processes that may contribute to food intake including sensorimotor [ ], reward [ , ], affective [ ], and cognitive [ , ] processing. Growing evidence suggests that the cerebellum contributes to hunger and satiety processing [ , ], meal anticipation [ , ], taste processing [ ], visual food cue processing [ , , , ], and satiation/meal cessation [ ] through connections with cortical and subcortical regions [ , ]. For example, cerebellar neurons respond to food cues and nutrients, and their activation can suppress food intake via signals to subcortical reward pathways [ ]. In humans, there is evidence that cerebellar responses to food cues (e.g., images, commercials) differ by the adolescent weight status [ ], child-reported loss of control eating [ ], and parent-reported child food responsiveness [ ], suggesting that cerebellar processing of visual food cues may contribute to pediatric eating behaviors. Therefore, it is important to characterize how cerebellar processing of food cues relates to objectively measured intake in youth. \n\nOur group\u2019s prior examination of associations between neural food cue reactivity and the PSE tested a cohort that was heterogeneous in body weight [ ]. However, since the weight status is associated with both neural responses to food cues [ ] and the PSE [ ], including children with and without obesity may confound results. Taking this into account, the present study aimed to examine how neural responses to food images varying in portion size relate to the PSE in children without obesity. To do so, children who had BMI-for-age-and-sex percentiles < 90 viewed images of larger and smaller portions of food during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and individual-level PSEs were estimated from intake of four laboratory meals that varied in portion size. We hypothesized that children\u2019s patterns of intake across the four portion size meals would relate to their neural responses to portion size within an a priori-defined appetitive network and the cerebellum. More specifically, we anticipated that increased susceptibility to the PSE would be associated with greater activation to larger vs. smaller portion size cues in regions implicated in reward and value processing (e.g., OFC, vmPFC) and less engagement in regions implicated in cognitive control (e.g., dorsolateral PFC, IFG), interoception (e.g., insula), and satiation (e.g., cerebellum). \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nAs part of a 7-visit, prospective study aiming to identify risk factors for pre-adolescent obesity (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03341247), 88 (45 male, 43 female) children (mean [SD] age = 7.8 [0.62] years) attended 6 baseline visits. Children were accompanied by the parent primarily responsible for feeding decisions and were required to be 7\u20138 years old and have a BMI-for-age-and-sex percentile < 90 (i.e., not have obesity). Children were ineligible if they were colorblind, not reading at grade level, not fluent in English, had a learning (e.g., dyslexia) or neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g., ADHD), had a diagnosed psychological condition (e.g., anxiety), were taking medications known to influence appetite, cognition, or blood flow, or had any MRI contraindications (e.g., metal in the body, claustrophobic). Consent and assent were obtained in accordance with the Institutional Review Board of The Pennsylvania State University. \n\nNeural responses to food and non-food cues in this cohort has been examined in a separate paper [ ], and the PSE has been examined in a larger behavioral sample [ ]. The associations between food cue reactivity and the PSE in the present publication have not been reported elsewhere. \n\n\n### 2.2. Data Collection \n  \nData for the present analyses were collected across six baseline visits between 2017 and 2022, with an ~8-month interruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic (study protocol and materials are available on Open Science Foundation at  , accessed on 21 February 2024). Procedures pertinent to the present analyses include the collection of demographics (see  ) and anthropometrics (see  ), assessment of parent-reported child appetitive traits (see  ), laboratory meals to assess the PSE (see  ), a mock-MRI protocol (see  ), and a food-cue task during fMRI (see   and  ;  ). Parents were instructed to have their child fast for at least 3 h prior to each visit to create a physiological state similar to what would be experienced prior to a meal. \n\n#### 2.2.1. Demographics \n  \nParents completed a questionnaire assessing child race and ethnicity, yearly family income, and parental education (see  ). Family income and maternal education were included as separate indicators of the socioeconomic status [ ]. \n\n\n#### 2.2.2. Anthropometrics \n  \nChildren\u2019s height and weight were measured twice by a trained researcher using a standard scale (Scale Tronix model 5002, Welch Allyn, Chicago, IL, USA; precision to nearest 0.1 kg) and stadiometer (precision to nearest 0.1 cm), respectively. Children removed shoes and heavy clothing items prior to measurement. The BMI-for-age-and-sex percentile was computed using averaged height and weight measurements based on growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ ]. \n\n\n#### 2.2.3. Laboratory Portion Size Meals \n  \nAcross four visits, children were served four laboratory meals that varied in the amount of food served [ ]. Meals contained varied amounts of macaroni and cheese, chicken nuggets, broccoli with margarine, and grapes, as well as fixed amounts of ketchup, and ad libitum access to water. The smallest portion size condition was the reference amount, and subsequent conditions increased all food weights by 33%, 66%, and 99% relative to the reference amount ( ). Reference amounts were based on the Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals [ ] and previous laboratory meal paradigms [ , ]. The order of portion sizes was randomly assigned and counterbalanced across the four meals. Foods were weighed before and after meals to the nearest 0.1 g, and nutrition facts labels or reliable online databases ( , accessed on 20 December 2023) were used to convert the weight consumed to kcal. \n\nPrior to each meal, children reported liking in response to tasting small samples (~2\u20133 g) of the meal foods using a five-point facial hedonic scale. They also reported fullness using a child-friendly visual analogue scale before and after each meal [ ]. Children were told they had 30 min to eat ad libitum until they reached satiation. If they reached satiation before 30 min, they could notify the researcher. Children were notified during the meal when 15 min had passed and when they had a few minutes remaining. Meals were served in an observation room that had a table and chairs, a rug with child-friendly images (e.g., trains), and non-food pictures (e.g., animals) on the wall. To serve as a neutral distraction during meals, children were read an age-appropriate, non-food-related book by either a trained researcher or computer (i.e., audio book); methodologies were consistent per child but switched during the COVID-19 pandemic to comply with social distancing restrictions. Mealtimes (i.e., lunch or dinner) varied across children based on participant availability but were consistent per child. \n\n\n#### 2.2.4. Mock-MRI Protocol \n  \nChildren completed a two-session mock-MRI protocol [ ] to familiarize them with the scanning environment. During the first session, children visited the mock scanning room and had an opportunity to ask questions. During the second session, children completed a mock scanning protocol where they entered a mock MRI bore, viewed non-food images, experienced simulated MRI sounds, and practiced using the response grip to make ratings. \n\n\n#### 2.2.5. fMRI Visit Protocol \n  \nChildren arrived for the fMRI visit following at least a 3 h fast. As individuals with and without an overweight status show an increased food cue response during fasted conditions [ ], we scanned children in the neutral appetitive state. To achieve this, children who reported fullness levels below 25% using a child-friendly visual analogue scale [ ] upon arrival were given a snack (6.75 fl oz of apple juice, Quaker Chewy granola bar) and then re-rated their fullness after consumption. This process was repeated a second time if a child continued to report fullness below 25%. The fullness rating collected closest to the scan was used as the index of pre-MRI fullness (imputed for one participant due to recording error; see  ). Before and after the scan, children rated their state anxiety using the Children\u2019s Anxiety Meter Scale [ ]. \n\n\n#### 2.2.6. MRI Data Acquisition \n  \nA 3 Tesla MRI scanner (Magnetom Trio model, Siemens, Malvern, PA, USA) and 20-channel head coil were used to collect imaging data. A T1-weighted MPRAGE (160 sagittal slices; TR = 1650; TE\u2009 = \u20092.03 ms; flip angle\u2009 = \u20099\u00b0; FOV\u2009 = \u2009256 \u00d7 256 mm ; voxel size = 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm ) was acquired using generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition (GRAPPA; acceleration factor 2) [ ]. During each run of the food-cue task (~2.7 min), 80 T2*-weighted images were acquired using echo planar imaging (EPI; slice thickness = 3 mm (no gap); 33 descending slices; TR\u2009 = \u20092000 ms; TE\u2009 = \u200926 ms; flip angle\u2009 = \u200990\u00b0; FOV\u2009 = \u2009220 \u00d7 220 mm ; voxel size = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm ). To optimize the temporal lobe and cerebellar signal based on prior findings relevant to our aims [ ], EPI scans were aligned parallel to the AC\u2013PC line and adjusted vertically. Each EPI scan was preceded by two unsaved \u201cdummy scans\u201d to establish a stable magnetization state prior to data collection. Lastly, a field map was acquired using a double-echo gradient-echo sequence (slice thickness = 3 mm (no gap), 33 descending slices, TR\u2009 = \u2009400 ms, TE 1\u2009 = \u20095.12 ms, TE 2 = 7.65 ms, flip angle\u2009 = \u200960\u00b0, FOV\u2009 = \u2009220 \u00d7 220 mm , voxel size = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm ). \n\n\n#### 2.2.7. Food-Cue Task \n  \nDuring the food-cue task, children viewed images of 120 food items and 60 non-food items (i.e., office supplies) presented one at a time ( ). Images were sourced from a standardized dataset [ ] and presented above smiley and frowny faces on a black screen ( A). To encourage engagement and attention during the task, children were instructed to indicate whether they wanted each item by pressing one of two buttons with their dominant hand (index finger for \u201cno\u201d/frowny face and thumb for \u201cyes\u201d/smiley face). Food images were categorized based on the amount (i.e., portion size; larger, smaller) and energy density (ED; higher: <1.5 kcal/g, lower: <1.5 kcal/g), creating four conditions with 30 images each: (1) a larger amount of higher-ED food, (2) larger amount of lower-ED food, (3) smaller amount of higher-ED food, and (4) smaller amount of lower-ED food. Food items depicted included those served during the meals (macaroni and cheese, chicken nuggets, broccoli, and grapes) as well as other foods commonly consumed by children (e.g., strawberries, cake, deli meat, pizza). Portions depicted in the smaller-amount condition were based on servings from nutrition facts labels and reflected amounts consumed per eating occasion by children in the 1990s [ ]. Office supplies were also categorized based on the amount (larger, smaller), creating two conditions. Images were presented in a block design over five runs; each run began with a 4.0 s fixation and contained one block (n = 6 images) per cue condition (i.e., six blocks per run;  B). Each image was presented for 2.0 s followed by a 0.5 s fixation. Each block was followed by an 8.0 s fixation. Children viewed blocks in one of two pseudorandomized and counterbalanced orders. \n\n\n\n### 2.3. fMRI Data Processing \n  \nStandard preprocessing steps were implemented using fMRIPrep 20.2.3 [ ] (see   for full report). MNI\u2019s unbiased template for pediatric cohort 3 (MNIped; ages 7\u201311 y) [ , ] was used for volume-based spatial normalization. Brain masks from BOLD signal (i.e., BOLD brain masks) and head-motion parameters were estimated from functional scans. Susceptibility distortion correction was applied to functional scans using a field-map-based approach (n = 62) or field-map-less approach (n = 1) if field-map quality was poor. Functional scans were also slice-time corrected (i.e., realigned) to the middle of each TR, co-registered to anatomical space, and resampled into MNIped space. Preprocessed data were visually inspected using summary reports generated by fMRIPrep. If quality of preprocessed data was poor, scans were excluded (see  ) or reprocessed. Data were subsequently blurred with a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel, scaled so results could be represented as percent signal change, and analyzed (see  ) using AFNI v21.3.04 [ , ]. \n\nIndividual-level general linear models (GLMs) included 1 parameter per food cue condition and were modeled by convolving block onset times and durations with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Onset times were shifted by subtracting half a TR (i.e., 1 s) to account for fMRIPrep\u2019s default slice-time realignment to the middle of each TR. In addition, GLMs included 14 nuisance regressors computed by fMRIPrep (6 rigid-body motion parameters and their derivatives, average signal within CSF and white matter masks). To ensure analyzed data were acquired during a stable magnetization state, the first two volumes of each run and any additional steady-state outliers identified by fMRIPrep were censored. To reduce the effects of motion, volumes with a framewise displacement [ ] > 0.9 mm were censored, matching the motion threshold used by the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD ) Study [ ]. Runs with >20% of volumes censored across task blocks were excluded from GLMs. A first-level portion size contrast (larger\u2013smaller food amounts, across ED) was generated from each GLM. \n\n\n### 2.3.1. Masks \n  \nSeparate appetitive network and cerebellum masks were generated using the Wake Forest University (WFU) PickAtlas toolbox for Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12 [ ]). Masks were dilated by 4 mm to avoid small, isolated regions and irregular boundaries and restricted to voxels scanned in at least 80% of children (e.g., to only include voxels inside the brain). Regions in the appetitive network mask ( ) were selected based on previous reviews [ , , ]; cortical regions were defined using Brodmann areas; and subcortical regions were defined based on anatomical boundaries ( ). The cerebellum was anatomically defined ( ). \n\n\n### 2.4. Group-Level Analyses \n  \n#### 2.4.1. Analysis Sample \n  \nChildren were excluded from analyses if they declined to enter the MRI (n = 4), did not complete at least 3 runs of the food-cue task (n = 4), or had fewer than 3 runs included in first-level analyses (see  ; n = 17). Children were also excluded from some analyses of eating behavior if they had data for <4 meals (due to measurement error) and thus could not be included in quadratic fixed-effects individual slopes models (n = 3; see  ). In addition, children were excluded from analyses within the appetitive mask if they had a reduced cortical field of view identified via visual inspection (n = 2). In sum, sample sizes for analyses ranged from N = 58 to 63. \n\n\n#### 2.4.2. Estimation of Individual-Level Portion Size Slopes \n  \nThe PSE (i.e., relationship between portion size and intake) was estimated for both weight (g) and energy (kcal) of food consumed. As large portions of food have been shown to increase intake in a curvilinear manner [ , ], we tested both linear and quadratic PSE models: (1) intake (g or kcal)~intercept + linear portion size, and (2) intake (g or kcal)~intercept + linear portion size + quadratic portion size. In subsequent sections, we refer to the linear slope of the linear model as the \u201clinear portion size slope\u201d and the quadratic slope of the quadratic model as the \u201cquadratic portion size slope\u201d. Meal portion size was modeled using the proportion increase from the reference portion (i.e., 0, 0.33, 0.66, 0.99) so that a 1-unit increase in portion size reflects the estimated change in intake between the reference portion and approximately the largest portion (100% increase). Fixed-effects individual slope (FEIS) models were used to extract child-specific slope estimates for the linear and quadratic PSE models (feisr 1.3.0 [ ] in R 4.2.2 [ ]). Both models were adjusted for meal-related influences on intake (i.e., pre-meal fullness, average pre-meal liking of foods at the meal, and meal order). \n\n\n#### 2.4.3. Descriptive Statistics \n  \nHistograms and Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov tests were used to assess the normality of linear and quadratic portion size slopes and imaging covariates (i.e., pre-MRI fullness, pre-MRI anxiety, framewise displacement). The mean and standard deviation are reported for normally distributed quantitative variables while quartiles (25% (Q1), 50%, 75% (Q3)) are reported for non-normally distributed variables. Pearson correlations were used to assess associations between linear and quadratic portion size slopes estimated for weight and energy consumed ( ). Associations between portion size slopes and child characteristics (age, BMI percentile, sex) were assessed using Pearson correlations for age and BMI percentile and 2-sample t-tests for sex ( ). Demographic variables and imaging covariates were compared between children included and excluded from analyses using 2-sample   t  -tests and   \u03c7   or Fisher\u2019s Exact Test for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. \n\n\n#### 2.4.4. Wanting Responses during the Food-Cue Task \n  \nUsing lme4 1.1-32 [ ] in R 4.2.2 [ ], a mixed-effects linear model with the subject as the random effect was used to compare the percent of items children reported wanting per block (%want) during the food-cue task between larger and smaller portion size conditions; models predicted %want from portion size (larger, smaller), controlling for the run. The estimated marginal means (EMMs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals from this model are reported for larger and smaller portion size conditions. \n\nTo explore whether wanting responses might mediate the observed association between neural responses and the PSE, a post hoc correlation was conducted between the average difference in %want between larger and smaller portion size conditions and the neural response to portion size (larger\u2013smaller) extracted from the cerebellar cluster associated with the quadratic portion size slope identified in fMRI analyses (see 2.4.5). \n\n\n#### 2.4.5. Neural Responses to Portion Size and the PSE \n  \nWithin each mask (see  ), four regression analyses (3dttest++) were used to test associations between the neural response to portion size (larger\u2013smaller) and child-specific portion size slopes; models included parameter estimates from (a) linear or (b) quadratic PSE models (see  ) estimated from (a) weight (g) or (b) energy (kcal) of food consumed. The predictors of interest include the linear and quadratic portion size slopes. Since individual slope estimates (e.g., linear slope) cannot be interpreted outside the context of the overall curve for each child (e.g., linear slopes depend on intercepts), all child-specific FEIS model coefficients were included in regression models (i.e., linear model: intercept + linear slope; quadratic model: intercept + linear slope + quadratic slope). Models were adjusted for average framewise displacement, sex, pre-MRI fullness, and pre-MRI anxiety to control for their potential effects on the BOLD response. Within each mask, cluster thresholds derived from 3dClustStim [ ] were used to adjust for multiple comparisons (voxel-wise threshold   p   < 0.001, cluster-corrected to   p   < 0.05). To examine whether significant results were confounded by the weight status, sensitivity analyses were conducted by including the BMI percentile as a covariate. \n\n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Participant Characteristics \n  \nThe analyzed sample was predominantly White (n = 61; 97%) and non-Hispanic/Latinx (n = 63; 100%), had family incomes > USD 50,000 and had mothers with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher ( ). Children included and excluded from analyses did not differ in demographics (  ps   > 0.59), pre-MRI anxiety (  p   > 0.05), or pre-MRI fullness (  p   > 0.88). As expected, children included in analyses exhibited less motion (i.e., average framewise displacement) during the food-cue task than those excluded (t(19) = \u22124.6,   p   < 0.001). \n\n\n### 3.2. Child-Specific Portion Size Curves \n  \nChild-specific linear portion size slopes (adjusted for meal order, average liking, and fullness) ranged from a decrease of 194 g or 205 kcal to an increase of 370 g or 647 kcal between the reference and largest portion sizes ( ). Despite the large range, 76% and 73% of children had positive linear portion size slope estimates for weight and energy consumed, respectively, indicating that most children increased intake with increasing portions as expected. Adjusting for meal order, average liking, and fullness, 38% (n = 23) of children had positive quadratic portion size slopes estimated from weight consumed, while 50% (n = 37) had positive quadratic portion size slopes estimated from energy consumed. Example quadratic portion size curves can be found in  . \n\n\n### 3.3. Behavioral Responses during the Food-Cue Task \n  \nThe median response rate during the food-cue task was 97.5% (Q1 = 95.8%, Q3 = 99.2%). The percentage of items wanted per block (%want) did not significantly differ between larger (EMM = 66.9; 95% CI: 62.1\u201371.6) and smaller (EMM = 68.3; 95% CI: 63.6\u201373.1) portion size conditions (F(1, 1141.2) = 1.02,   p   = 0.31). The average difference in %want between larger and smaller portion size conditions was not significantly correlated with the neural response to portion size (larger\u2013smaller) in the cerebellar cluster associated with the quadratic portion size slope (see  ; r(56) = \u22120.50,   p   = 0.62). \n\n\n### 3.4. Associations between Neural Responses to Portion Size and the PSE \n  \n#### 3.4.1. Appetitive Network Mask \n  \nIn models adjusted for framewise displacement, sex, pre-MRI fullness, pre-MRI anxiety, and FEIS model coefficients, there was no association between the linear or quadratic portion size slopes (weight or energy) and neural response to portion size (larger vs. smaller) within the appetitive network (  p   > 0.05). \n\n\n#### 3.4.2. Cerebellum Mask \n  \nAdjusting for the same variables listed above ( ), the quadratic portion size slope estimated from gram intake was negatively associated with the neural response to portion size (larger\u2013smaller) in cerebellar lobules IV\u2013VI (MNI peak: 7, \u221262, \u221213; cluster size = 1853 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm  voxels; peak z-statistic = \u22124.83;   and  ). More positive quadratic portion size slopes were associated with lower activation to images depicting larger compared to smaller food portions while more negative quadratic portion size slopes were associated with greater activation to images depicting larger compared to smaller food portions. Therefore, children who showed steeper increases in weight consumed with increasing portion sizes had lower cerebellar activation to images depicting larger compared to smaller food portions. In contrast, children who showed plateaus of or steeper declines in weight consumed with increasing portion sizes had greater cerebellar activation to images depicting larger compared to smaller food portions (see  ). Results were similar after additionally adjusting for the BMI percentile (MNI peak: 7, \u221261, \u221213; cluster size = 1935 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm  voxels; peak z-statistic = \u22124.94). Cerebellar responses to portion size were not associated with linear portion size slopes (g or kcal) or the quadratic portion size slope estimated from kcal. \n\n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThe present study examined how neural responses to food portion size relate to the PSE in children without obesity. Results revealed an association between food cue activation in the cerebellum (culmen, declive) and the amount (weight) of food consumed across meals varying in portion size. As cerebellar activation to larger (relative to smaller) portion sizes increased, children exhibited plateaus or steeper declines in intake with increasing portion sizes. Conversely, as cerebellar activation to larger (relative to smaller) portion sizes decreased, children exhibited steeper increases in intake with increasing portion sizes. These findings suggest that decreased cerebellar activation in response to larger amounts of food may increase children\u2019s susceptibility to overeating when faced with \u201csupersized\u201d portions of food. \n\nCerebellum lobules IV\u2013VI (culmen, declive) are implicated in multiple processes relevant to feeding behavior [ ], including leptin sensitivity [ ], chewing [ ], food cue reactivity [ , ], reward anticipation and expectation [ ], and emotional conditioning [ ]. For example, in adults with leptin deficiency, a greater number of days of receiving leptin replacement was associated with greater lobule VI activation to high-energy food vs. non-food images [ ], suggesting hormones that influence satiety alter food cue responding in the cerebellum. The function and structure of lobules IV\u2013VI have also been associated with self-reported eating behavior (e.g., disinhibition [ ], loss of control [ , ]) and weight status [ , , , ]. These findings, along with our observation that activation in lobules IV\u2013VI relates to objectively measured food intake in children, indicate that cerebellar processes contribute to susceptibility to overconsumption. \n\nWith the addition of the present findings, there is growing evidence that intact cerebellar function supports the development of satiation [ , ] and meal cessation [ ]. For example, in mice, the activation of anterior deep cerebellar nuclei reduced meal size and feeding duration, leading to reductions in food intake [ ]. This change was mediated by blunted phasic dopamine responses to food consumption, suggesting the cerebellar induction of satiation via reward-related pathways (i.e., hedonic satiation [ ]). Low and colleagues [ ] proposed that the cerebellum fine-tunes predictive reward signals by integrating information about the expected nutrient value from food (or food cues) with the physiological nutrient status. Over the course of a meal, cerebellar neurons sense the nutrient status and induce dopamine efflux, leading to an eventual blunting of food-dependent phasic dopamine responses that is necessary to reduce the value of further consumption and bring about meal cessation [ ]. Thus, children who have reduced cerebellar activation to larger portions of food may not be adequately fine-tuning predictive reward signals based on the nutrient status during a meal, enabling sustained motivation to eat and delayed meal cessation when they are presented with excessively large portions. This postulation aligns with behavioral research demonstrating that increased susceptibility to the PSE in children is associated with decreased sensitivity to internal fullness signals (i.e., satiety responsiveness) and increased sensitivity to external food cues (i.e., food responsiveness) [ ]. Alternatively, in line with behavioral research showing associations between the PSE and executive functions [ ], the cerebellum may influence satiation via the modulation of cognitive processes [ , ]. PFC\u2013cerebellar interactions are thought to enable the optimization of behaviors according to context [ ], and the modulation of PFC\u2013cerebellar interactions has been shown to modulate food-induced appetite and hunger in individuals with obesity [ ]. As the cerebellum is implicated in a variety of additional processes that could underlie its association with child appetitive behavior (e.g., oral behaviors [ , ], ocular control to visualize objects of interest [ ], affect [ ]), our interpretations are speculative, and additional research is needed to delineate the role of the cerebellum in meal cessation and the PSE. \n\nIn contrast to our hypotheses, we did not observe associations between portion size slopes estimated from weight or energy consumed and neural responses within the appetitive network (i.e., a mask of cortical and subcortical regions implicated in the control of food intake). This is in contrast to a previous study in 7\u201310-year-old children [ ] where linear and quadratic relationships between portion size and intake were modulated by neural responses to portion size cues in the OFC, vmPFC, IFG, and caudate. Differences in results may be due to demographic differences between the samples: the present sample was younger (7\u20138 years) than the sample in [ ] and did not include children with obesity. As puberty influences the development of brain regions implicated in reward and cognitive control [ ], associations observed in older children may not generalize to younger children. Further, neural responses to portion size in brain regions associated with valuation and cognitive control may not influence food intake prior to the development of excess adipose tissue. In addition, differences in results may be due to methodology: the present study examined susceptibility to the PSE with fixed-effect individual slope models rather than mixed-effects models and examined voxel-wise associations within a masked area rather than using a region-of-interest-based approach. The two studies also used different data processing methodology (e.g., choice of structural atlas, use of spatial smoothing) and software, which could impact results. To better understand how neural responses within the appetitive network relate to the PSE, future research should test the moderating effects of puberty and the weight status and compare analytic methods. \n\nThis study has several strengths. First, we objectively measured food intake to quantify intake rather than using self-reported measures of dietary behavior, which are subject to misreporting [ ]. Second, intake was assessed at four laboratory meals, allowing us to capture both linear and quadratic relationships between intake and portion size. Third, using a voxel-wise analytic approach within masks allowed us to explore associations between individual-level portion size slopes and neural responses within a larger brain area than previous region-of-interest-based analyses [ ]. Despite these strengths, the sample size of the present study was smaller than proposed ( , accessed on 20 December 2023) due to data loss (e.g., from motion) and difficulty recruiting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Small sample sizes can increase the risk of both false negatives and false positives [ ]; thus, results will need to be replicated in other samples. In addition, the sample was predominately White and not Hispanic, so results may not generalize to more diverse populations. Further, while objective assessment of food intake mitigates error compared to self-report methods, eating behaviors observed in the laboratory may not generalize outside the laboratory environment. Lastly, the identified association between cerebellar function and intake was observational and does not indicate causality. The causal relationship between cerebellar function and the portion size effect could be tested empirically by modulating cerebellar activation (e.g., with transcranial direct current stimulation, as performed in [ ]) prior to assessments of food intake. \n\nThis is the first study to examine how neural responses to portion size cues across the appetitive network and cerebellum relate to changes in objectively measured intake as portion sizes increase. The present results suggest that decreased cerebellar activation to large portion size cues in children without obesity may be a risk factor for overeating in response to large portions. Based on prior studies [ , , ], reduced activation may influence the PSE by increasing hunger or reducing satiation via reward or cognitive mechanisms; nevertheless, additional research is needed to test this. If future research supports a causal mechanism between cerebellar function and the PSE, interventions that modulate cerebellum activity (e.g., non-invasive stimulation [ ], mindfulness training [ ], cognitive training [ ], cognitive behavioral therapy [ ]) may mitigate increased intake in response to large portions. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10933954, "text_md5": "49f349eacd03b8b185832bf290d79b9a", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 163], "journal": [164, 173], "publication_year": [175, 179], "title": [190, 296], "keywords": [310, 364], "abstract": [377, 1785], "body": [1794, 36560]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 38474866, "doi": "10.3390/nu16050738", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10933954", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10933954"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10933954\">10933954</a>", "list_title": "PMC10933954  The Cerebellar Response to Visual Portion Size Cues Is Associated with the Portion Size Effect in Children"}
