It was largely assumed that texture was processed in primary somatosensory regions in the brain; however, imaging studies indicate heterogeneous patterns of brain activity associated with texture processing. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nTo address this, we conducted a coordinate\u2010based activation likelihood estimation meta\u2010analysis of 13 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (comprising 15 experiments contributing 228 participants and 275 foci) selected by a systematic review. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nConcordant activations for texture perception occurred in the left primary somatosensory and motor regions, with bilateral activations in the secondary somatosensory, posterior insula, and premotor and supplementary motor cortices. We also evaluated differences between studies that compared touch processing to non\u2010haptic control (e.g., rest or visual control) or those that used haptic control (e.g., shape or orientation perception) to specifically investigate texture encoding. Studies employing a haptic control revealed concordance for texture processing only in the left secondary somatosensory cortex. Contrast analyses demonstrated greater concordance of activations in the left primary somatosensory regions and inferior parietal cortex for studies with a non\u2010haptic control, compared to experiments accounting for other haptic aspects. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThese findings suggest that texture processing may recruit higher order integrative structures, and the secondary somatosensory cortex may play a key role in encoding textural properties. The present study provides unique insight into the neural correlates of texture\u2010related processing by assessing the influence of non\u2010textural haptic elements and identifies opportunities for a future research design to understand the neural processing of texture. \n\n  \nOur review provides unique insight into the understanding of texture perception in the brain by investigating texture processing compared to non\u2010haptic and haptic baselines. Activation likelihood estimation demonstrated concordant activation for texture processing in primary and high\u2010order sensorimotor regions. Further, contrast analysis suggested texture processing preferentially recruits high\u2010order integrative structures.\n   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nHumans typically explore and gather haptic information using discriminative touch through the glabrous skin on their hands and digits (Gibson,  ; Lederman & Klatzky,  ; Wagner & Gibson,  ). Previous research investigating texture perception and brain activation commonly focus on one textural feature, with roughness the most studied (Hollins et\u00a0al.,  ). This meta\u2010analysis aimed to collate research articles using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods to identify regions of the brain associated with texture perception of various stimuli during discriminative touch. For the purpose of this review, texture perception was defined as the activation of low\u2010threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) and the dorsal column\u2010medial lemniscus (DCML) pathway (Gardner & Johnson,  ). Importantly, this excludes thermal perception via thermoreceptors and the spinothalamic tract, which has previously been included as a dimension of texture (Okamoto et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nThe glabrous skin of hands contains LTMRs, which transduce incoming tactile information from surface texture (Gomez\u2010Ramirez et\u00a0al.,  ; Harvey et\u00a0al.,  ; Johnson et\u00a0al.,  ; McGlone & Reilly,  ). Tactile information from LTMRs travels through the DCML pathway to the brain, and thalamocortical afferents convey signals to the primary (SI) and secondary somatosensory cortices (SII; Klingner et\u00a0al.,  ; Raju & Tadi,  )). In humans, texture processing elicits bilateral activation in the SI and SII (Genna et\u00a0al.,  ; Sim\u00f5es\u2010Franklin et\u00a0al.,  ). Lesions in the macaque SI and SII lead to impairment of texture perception (Garcha & Ettlinger,  ; Randolph & Semmes,  ). Moreover, the SII is hypothesized to be responsible for roughness discrimination (Kitada et\u00a0al.,  ; Sathian et\u00a0al.,  ; Servos et\u00a0al.,  ; Stilla & Sathian,  ). \n\nThe activation of LTMRs requires voluntary movement or dynamic passive touch and contact pressure. The MI and non\u2010primary motor regions, split into the supplementary motor area (SMA) and premotor cortex, are responsible for planning and initiating limb movements (Rizzolatti & Kalaska,  ; Rizzolatti & Luppino,  ). Therefore, in contrast to employing voluntary movement (i.e., active touch), the MI and premotor areas would be activated due to motor preparation and execution. \n\nSomatosensory information is also processed in the insula, with the posterior region of the insular cortex found to be functionally connected to sensorimotor areas including the SI, SII, primary motor cortex (MI), and SMA (Deen et\u00a0al.,  ; Taylor et\u00a0al.,  ). The insula is conceptualized as an integration hub as it is connected to many brain regions and is associated not only with sensory inputs (Craig et\u00a0al.,  ; Jensen et\u00a0al.,  ; Segerdahl et\u00a0al.,  ) but also with affective processing (Bj\u00f6rnsdotter et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Morrison,  ; Olausson et\u00a0al.,  ) and higher level cognition such as decision\u2010making (Gogolla,  ; Uddin et\u00a0al.,  ). Therefore, texture perception in the brain likely involves the insula (Kitada et\u00a0al.,  ; Stilla & Sathian,  ). \n\nThe posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is linked to multisensory integration, combining inputs from several brain areas, including somatosensory, auditory, visual, motor, cingulate, and prefrontal cortices (Buneo & Andersen,  ; Whitlock,  ). Increased activation in the PPC has been demonstrated during grasping, reaching, and interacting with objects (Vingerhoets,  ). In humans, the PPC can be divided into three regions: the superior parietal lobule (SPL), the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS; Gardner & Johnson,  ). The SPL integrates proprioceptive information to guide motor actions (Hadjidimitrakis et\u00a0al.,  ; Johns,  ; Kalaska,  ), while the IPL interprets sensory information to aid in the preparation of motor acts such as hand grasping movement for object manipulation (Bodeg\u00e5rd et\u00a0al.,  ; Vingerhoets,  ). Similarly, the IPS plays a role in the multisensory processing of vision and touch (Amedi et\u00a0al.,  ; Cusack,  ; Grefkes et\u00a0al.,  ; Peltier et\u00a0al.,  ; Saito et\u00a0al.,  ; Tal & Amedi,  ), contributing to a range of cognitive functions including spatial imagery (Cohen et\u00a0al.,  ) and attention (Macaluso et\u00a0al.,  ). Lesions within these areas impact sensorimotor integration and somatosensory processing (Freund,  ; Murray & Mishkin,  ); lesions to the SPL and surrounding IPS can impair the sensorimotor integration of proprioceptive signals and cause optic ataxia (Andersen et\u00a0al.,  ; Perenin & Vighetto,  ), while lesions to the IPL can cause tactile agnosia (Reed & Caselli,  ; Reed et\u00a0al.,  ). Therefore, it is likely that texture discrimination through active touch activates the PPC to aid sensorimotor integration and somatosensory processing. \n\nIn the present study, a coordinate\u2010based meta\u2010analysis was performed with an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) of published fMRI findings relating to the neural correlates of texture perception (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). First, we aimed to identify key brain regions involved in texture perception at hand and/or digit skin sites using concordance analysis to identify regions of the brain with the highest activation likelihood. Second, we attempted to identify key brain regions involved in texture\u2010specific perception when controlling for other haptic elements involved in discriminative touch (e.g., location, orientation, and shape). For this purpose, we performed conjunction and contrast analyses to compare fMRI studies which contrasted texture perception with a resting or non\u2010haptic control with those which used a haptic baseline to control for these non\u2010texture aspects of discriminative touch. \n\nWe hypothesized that areas consistently reported in tactile perception studies would result in activation, which are bilateral SI, SII, and insular cortices. Further, we expected that areas associated with voluntary movement and motor planning would show activation, including bilateral MI, SMA, premotor cortex, and PPC. When controlling for the influence of haptic processing, we anticipated an increased likelihood of activation in medial brain regions associated with higher order processing or texture\u2010specific processing such as the SII and insular cortex. \n\n\n## METHOD \n  \nThis systematic review is reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\u2010Analyses guidelines (Moher et\u00a0al.,  ). The review protocol was registered on Open Science Framework ( ) on November 3, 2020. \n\n### Data search and extraction \n  \nThree electronic databases were examined during February 2023 (PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) using the Medical Subject Headings search terms (magnetic resonance imaging OR fMRI) AND (functional OR brain activation OR neural activity OR BOLD) AND (texture OR rough* OR smooth* OR soft*) AND (touch OR tactile OR haptic OR somatosensory). No date limit was set for the searches. A citation search was conducted of the five most recent research papers accepted for analysis. \n\n\n### Article selection and extraction of data \n  \nArticle selection consisted of two stages and was conducted by the same two authors (Jessica Henderson and Tyler Mari). First, the title and abstract for all unique search results were assessed separately by the two authors, and studies identified as relevant were retrieved for full\u2010text review. During the second stage, full\u2010text articles, retrieved from stage one, were reviewed independently for inclusion, and disagreements were resolved via discussion or presented to a third arbiter (Nicholas Fallon). One author (Jessica Henderson) extracted the relevant coordinate data, which were cross\u2010checked and confirmed by a second author (Tyler Mari). Studies that reported coordinates in Talairach space were converted into Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) using the GingerALE software for analysis and reporting (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Turkeltaub et\u00a0al.,  ). Studies that employed a region\u2010of\u2010interest (ROI) analysis to investigate the contrast of interest were included in the cohort when whole\u2010brain statistical data were available from online repositories, such as NeuroVault (Gorgolewski et\u00a0al.,  ). In such instances,\u00a0the\u00a0unthresholded t\u2010maps resulting from the fMRI analysis were\u00a0manually\u00a0thresholded\u00a0at   uncorrected voxelwise throughout the whole brain with a   cluster\u2010level correction\u00a0to give whole\u2010brain results. \n\n\n### Eligibility criteria \n  \nThe criteria for inclusion were as follows: (i) fMRI studies; (ii) original English language articles; (iii) published in a peer\u2010reviewed journal; (iv) healthy human participants aged 18+; (v) using a paradigm where the hand and/or fingers are either passively or actively stimulated by textured stimuli, that is, three\u2010dimensional (3D)\u2010printed texture, natural texture, or man\u2010made textures; (vi) coordinates were reported in the paper or supplementary material in either MNI (Evans et\u00a0al.,  ) or Talairach space (Talairach & Tournoux,  ); (vii) studies which analyzed either of the two contrasts of interest: (1) texture perception through hand and/or finger stimulation compared to non\u2010haptic control conditions, such as rest, visual control (e.g., visual instructions or rating scales with the absence of textured stimuli) or motor control (e.g., hand motion with the absence of textured stimuli), and (2) texture perception through hand and/or fingers stimulation compared to haptic control conditions, which included shape, location, and orientation tasks. See Figure\u00a0  for a flowchart showing the study selection steps. \n  \nFlow chart depicting the screening process. ALE, activation likelihood estimation. \n  \nALE meta\u2010analyses were performed in BrainMap GingerALE v3.0.2 (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Turkeltaub et\u00a0al.,  ). The ALE method computes an ALE value for each voxel in the brain and performs tests to determine the null distribution of the ALE statistic at each voxel, with increased ALE values suggestive of more studies reporting activated peaks in specific loci or at neighbouring voxels using a Gaussian distribution. Next,   p  \u2010values computed from the previous step are used to calculate a thresholded ALE map, and thereafter cluster analysis is performed on the thresholded map. \n\nFor the primary analyses, the comparison of texture perception\u00a0>\u00a0control, texture perception\u00a0>\u00a0non\u2010haptic control, and texture perception\u00a0>\u00a0haptic control was evaluated with permutation analyses performed with 5000 permutations. First, a cluster\u2010forming threshold of uncorrected\u00a0  was applied (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ), followed by cluster\u2010level family\u2010wise error correction   as recommended (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ). For the secondary analyses, the thresholded ALE images from the primary analysis were compared using conjunction and contrast analyses; this was executed by permutation analysis with 10,000 permutations and a cluster\u2010level false discovery rate threshold of\u00a0 , with a minimum cluster size of 200\u00a0mm  as recommended (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ), and in line with previous research (Morrison,  ). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nA total of 870 articles were identified from searches (PubMed, 244; PsycInfo, 362; Web of Science, 264; Figure\u00a0 ). Of these, 485 articles were removed due to duplication from repeated searches. An additional 337 articles were removed during the titles and abstracts review stage. Studies excluded at this stage included those where it was clear and obvious that no suitable population was reported (106), not an experimental report published in a peer\u2010reviewed journal (16), did not use fMRI methods (80), not using suitable textured stimuli (130), and not addressing one of the outcomes outlined (5). Following full\u2010text review, a further 35 articles were removed including those that used an unsuitable contrast (121), did not utilize appropriate textured stimuli (13), did not conduct an fMRI contrast study (5), were not an experimental report journal article (3), only reported ROI analysis and whole brain data were not available (1; see Section\u00a0 ), or which did not report findings in English (1). This resulted in a final cohort of 13 studies for the analyses of texture perception (Table\u00a0 ), with the age range of participants recruited being 18\u201347 years. The citation search did not lead to the inclusion of any additional studies. Studies contributing to this ALE stimulated the right hand, with (Kitada et\u00a0al.,  ) stimulating both hands and combining results. Therefore, concordant activation in the left and right hemispheres correspond to contralateral and ipsilateral activation, respectively. \n  \nStudies included in activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta\u2010analysis. \n    \n### Primary analyses \n  \n#### Texture perception\u00a0>\u00a0control \n  \nTexture perception\u00a0>\u00a0control contrast ALE meta\u2010analysis pooled data from 13 studies which contributed 15 experiments, with a total of 228 participants and 275 reported foci. The results revealed seven significant clusters (Table\u00a0 ). One cluster originated from the right hemisphere and spanned from the superior temporal gyrus to the postcentral gyrus, corresponding to both the right posterior insula (PI) and SII. One cluster was identified in the left hemisphere from the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) in the IPL to the SI.

The results revealed six significant clusters (Table\u00a0 ); one cluster spanned from the right superior temporal gyrus to the postcentral gyrus, consistent with both PI and SII. Cluster two, in the left hemisphere, spanned from the SMG in the IPL to the SI. Cluster six corresponded to the left SI and MI. Further clusters encompassed the bilateral SMA and the bilateral PMv.

There were no findings of overlap of activation likelihood coordinates across both contrast types. \n\n\n#### Contrast analyses \n  \nContrast analysis comparing the ALE maps of concordant activations for each process pointed to a significantly greater likelihood of activation during general texture perception (texture perception\u00a0>\u00a0non\u2010haptic control) relative to texture\u2010specific perception (texture perception\u00a0>\u00a0haptic control) in three clusters (Figure\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). Two left clusters included the SI and the SMG in the IPL, as well as the SI, MI, and premotor areas. The third cluster was located in the right IPL and corresponded to the SMG. The reverse contrast did not reveal any clusters indicative of increased activation likelihood estimates during the texture\u2010specific perception relative to general texture perception studies. \n  \nThe location of significant clusters from contrast analysis of activation likelihood estimation (ALE) maps for a greater likelihood of texture perception\u00a0>\u00a0non\u2010haptic control relative to texture perception\u00a0>\u00a0haptic control.

The sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of the right SII cluster and left SI/IPL across all 13 studies. Leaving out Yang et\u00a0al. ( ) resulted in the left PMv and left PI clusters no longer reaching significance. The SMA cluster was not identified when leaving out Mueller et\u00a0al. ( ), Sim\u00f5es\u2010Franklin et\u00a0al. ( ), Yang et\u00a0al. ( ), and Kitada et\u00a0al. ( ). In addition, leaving out Kitada et\u00a0al. ( ) and Mueller et\u00a0al. ( ) resulted in the loss of the right PMv cluster. The right PI cluster was not identified as significant when leaving out Kitada et\u00a0al. ( ), Mueller et\u00a0al. ( ), Sathian et\u00a0al. ( ), and Stilla and Sathian ( ). Further, an additional cluster in the right PI/SII was identified when removing Sim\u00f5es\u2010Franklin et\u00a0al. ( ), Mueller et\u00a0al. ( ), Wang et\u00a0al. ( ), Yang et\u00a0al. ( ), and Kim et\u00a0al. ( ). Removing Kitada et\u00a0al. ( ) and Yang et\u00a0al. ( ) led to the identification of a further cluster in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Finally, a cluster from the left SI to the left MI was uncovered when removing Kitada et\u00a0al. ( ), Sathian et\u00a0al. ( ), Sim\u00f5es\u2010Franklin et\u00a0al. ( ), and Yang et\u00a0al. ( ,  ). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nFindings from the primary ALE meta\u2010analysis of texture perception relative to control revealed nine significant clusters with activation in the left SI and SMG, bilateral PMv and SMA, and the right SII and PI, consistent with our hypotheses that texture perception would activate the sensorimotor regions that are well associated with tactile perception and movement planning and execution. The presence of haptic control conditions during texture perception identified activation in the left SII, in line with our hypothesis that texture processing activates brain regions associated with higher order processing. Further, contrast analyses revealed sensorimotor (SI, MI, and SMG) activations as more predominant in the non\u2010haptic control contrast than when controlling for other haptic processing, suggesting that texture\u2010specific processing may require the activation of higher order cortical regions. \n\nLeft SII was the only region selectively activated when contrasting texture processing with a haptic control, indicating its role in texture\u2010specific processing. The human parietal operculum comprises four distinct cytoarchitectonic areas (OP1\u22124; Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ,  ), with concordant activation in the left SII cluster corresponding to OP4. The SII has previously been implicated in higher order processes, including attention (Chen et\u00a0al.,  ; H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen et\u00a0al.,  ), learning (Mishkin,  ; Ridley & Ettlinger,  ), and roughness discrimination (Kitada et\u00a0al.,  ; Sathian et\u00a0al.,  ; Servos et\u00a0al.,  ; Stilla & Sathian,  ). Additionally, concordant activation was found in OP4 during a detect\u2010discriminate touch meta\u2010analysis (Morrison,  ), and this region, along with OP1 and OP3, has been proposed as texture selective (Sathian et\u00a0al.,  ; Stilla & Sathian,  ). Research with non\u2010human primates shows that lesions to the SII result in deficits in texture and shape discrimination (Garcha & Ettlinger,  ; Murray & Mishkin,  ), while humans with lesions in the area suffer from tactile apraxia (Binkofski et\u00a0al.,  ). (Jiang et\u00a0al.,  ; Pruett et\u00a0al.,  ; Sinclair & Burton,  ). Furthermore, low\u2010 and high\u2010frequency vibrotactile cues elicit differential patterns of brain activation, with increased SII activation during high\u2010frequency vibrotactile stimulation (Chung et\u00a0al.,  ; Francis et\u00a0al.,  ; Han et\u00a0al.,  ; Harrington & Hunter Downs,  ; Ryun, Kim, Lee, et\u00a0al.,  ). Concordant activation in the SII when contrasting with haptic control was observed only in response to textiles, which are more likely to induce high\u2010frequency vibrations due to their finer grained surface texture. Taken together the results of this meta\u2010analysis, it is likely that the SII plays a significant role in the higher order encoding of textural properties, which may be correlated with high\u2010frequency vibrotactile information. \n\nConjunction and contrast analyses were computed to examine similarities and differences between the processing of generic discriminative touch, by comparing texture processing to non\u2010haptic control conditions, relative to brain regions that are more selectively activated during texture processing/evaluations, which were determined by comparing texture processing to haptic control conditions. Concordant activation in the left SI (Brodmann's area; BA 3) and bilateral SMG was more likely to be activated during texture perception compared to non\u2010haptic control contrast, relative to touch minus haptic control contrast tasks that accounted for other aspects of discrimination (e.g., shape). Interestingly, the conjunction analysis did not identify any overlap of findings across studies with these differing approaches. Demonstrating that concordant activation of the SII cluster in the texture relative to haptic control ALE analysis may be specific to texture processing. These findings indicate that broad aspects of tactile information are processed in the sensorimotor areas, hence the dominance in contrasts which do not correct for haptic processing in the baseline. However, the absence of deeper SII or PI clusters indicates that important aspects of texture\u2010specific processing may occur in higher order medial regions such as the SII and insular cortex (Eck et\u00a0al.,  ; Jiang et\u00a0al.,  ; Roland et\u00a0al.,  ), which may require careful consideration of experimental design, and particularly baseline, to investigate. This aligns with the presence of an SII cluster in the texture relative to haptic control ALE analysis. \n\nBilateral PI was found to be active when investigating texture processing compared to control (i.e., non\u2010haptic and haptic control conditions combined). The insular cortex has been linked with somatosensation (Kurth et\u00a0al.,  ; Preusser et\u00a0al.,  ) and has been associated with the intensity processing of thermosensory (Craig et\u00a0al.,  ) and noxious stimuli (Frot et\u00a0al.,  ; Iannetti et\u00a0al.,  ). Roughness\u2010related activation has been reported in the parietal operculum and insula (Kitada et\u00a0al.,  ). Therefore, the insula may play a role in the processing or evaluation of texture intensity. For the present meta\u2010analysis, 10 studies were included where participants were asked to complete an estimation or comparison task, evaluating textural features with a response (Gurtubay\u2010Antolin et\u00a0al.,  ; Kitada et\u00a0al.,  ; Mueller et\u00a0al.,  ; Podrebarac et\u00a0al.,  ; Sathian et\u00a0al.,  ; Sim\u00f5es\u2010Franklin et\u00a0al.,  ; Stilla & Sathian,  ; Wang et\u00a0al.,  ; Yang et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). The insula is anatomically interconnected to the prefrontal cortex (Burton & Sinclair,  ; Preusser et\u00a0al.,  ); as such, the insula is conceptualized as an integrative region associated with both sensory input (Craig et\u00a0al.,  ; Jensen et\u00a0al.,  ; Segerdahl et\u00a0al.,  ) and cognitive processes, such as decision\u2010making (Gogolla,  ; Uddin et\u00a0al.,  ). Therefore, insula activation may reflect the integration of sensory input, which may be crucial for higher order cognitive decisions based on sensory features. \n\nSI and SMG were found to be active when comparing texture processing to both control and non\u2010haptic control conditions. The SI processes tactile information and encompasses BA 3a, 3b, 1, and 2 (Case et\u00a0al.,  ; Chapman,  ; Lieber & Bensmaia,  ,  ; Lin et\u00a0al.,  ; Purves et\u00a0al.,  ). Concordant activation peaked in BA 2 of the left SI, which is associated with the processing of tactile and proprioceptive input (Hyv\u00e4rinen & Poranen,  ; Padberg et\u00a0al.,  ; Pons et\u00a0al.,  ). Furthermore, the tactile stimulation of the fingers is consistently associated with activation of BA 2 (Hlushchuk & Hari,  ; Holmes et\u00a0al.,  ; Janko et\u00a0al.,  ; Puckett et\u00a0al.,  ), suggesting concordant activation in the SI corresponds to the finger area. Active touch engages sensorimotor circuits in the PPC, including the SMG located in the IPL, and activation in these regions has been associated with sensorimotor integration (Arikan et\u00a0al.,  ; Batista et\u00a0al.,  ; Battaglia\u2010Mayer et\u00a0al.,  ; Buneo et\u00a0al.,  ; Buneo & Andersen,  ; Ferraina et\u00a0al.,  ; Hyv\u00e4rinen,  ; Lamp et\u00a0al.,  ; Mountcastle et\u00a0al.,  ; Naito et\u00a0al.,  ; Snyder et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nThe MI demonstrated concordant activation only when compared to the non\u2010haptic control condition. Concordant activation of the MI, associated with the execution of voluntary movement (Kalaska & Rizzolatti,  ), was observed to be predominantly engaged within the hand knob area (Bonzano et\u00a0al.,  ; Hardwick et\u00a0al.,  ; Puce et\u00a0al.,  ; Yousry et\u00a0al.,  ). An exploratory analysis of experiments employing active touch found concordant activation in premotor and motor areas, while passive touch did not (Supporting Information  ). However, two studies contributing to the concordant activation identified in the MI cluster employed dynamic passive touch (Kitada et\u00a0al.,  ; Tang et\u00a0al.,  ); therefore, concordance of MI activation may also be due to force exerted by the finger during passive paradigms rather than solely due to active touch (Dettmers et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nConcordant activation was identified in both the bilateral PMv and SMA across two ALE analyses, one that considered all studies irrespective of the control condition and the other that only considered baselines that did not account for other haptic elements (i.e., non\u2010haptic control). The PMv is associated with both tactile processing (Avanzini et\u00a0al.,  ; Ryun et\u00a0al.,  ) and movement\u2010related functions, including grasping and object manipulation (Davare et\u00a0al.,  ,  ,  ; Fogassi et\u00a0al.,  ; Reader & Holmes,  ; Vingerhoets et\u00a0al.,  ). In non\u2010human primates, the PMv has been linked to the evaluation of sensory information for guiding motor action (Romo et\u00a0al.,  ). Five studies that contributed to the bilateral PMv clusters involved active touch (Mueller et\u00a0al.,  ; Sathian et\u00a0al.,  ; Sim\u00f5es\u2010Franklin et\u00a0al.,  ; Wang et\u00a0al.,  ; Yang et\u00a0al.,  ). Accordingly, SMA neurons discharge before and during coordinated voluntary movement (Tanji,  ; Tanji & Shima,  ), such as button pressing. Therefore, PMv and SMA activation may reflect the evaluation of sensory information to inform response behavior during experimental paradigms. \n\nThe current meta\u2010analysis is impacted by the limited number of studies, partially due to the absence of a standardized paradigm, resulting in the rejection of 130 studies due to stimuli/paradigm discrepancies. Therefore, establishing a standardized texture perception paradigm would benefit the field. Further, a vast range of tactile stimuli are used in texture perception paradigms, including gratings (Kitada et\u00a0al.,  ,  ), 3D\u2010printed textures (Mueller et\u00a0al.,  ; Yang et\u00a0al.,  ), dot patterns (Yang et\u00a0al.,  ,  ), and textiles (Gurtubay\u2010Antolin et\u00a0al.,  ; Wang et\u00a0al.,  ), each varying considerably in their tactile properties. Textiles are often finer grained and therefore are more likely to rely on vibrational cues generated through movement, while coarse textures such as gratings depend on distinct spatial patterns (Moungou et\u00a0al.,  ; Weber et\u00a0al.,  ). Consequently, findings are difficult to collate to investigate texture\u2010specific processing. In the future, a standardized battery of textural stimuli would aid researchers to align and compare findings across studies, laboratories, and geographical regions. Furthermore, concordant activation identified in the SI, MI, PMv, IPL, SII, and insula parallels human electrophysiological mapping studies (Ryun et\u00a0al.,  ; Ryun, Kim, Jeon, et\u00a0al.,  ; Ryun, Kim, Lee, et\u00a0al., 2017), providing further evidence that these areas contribute to tactile perception. While a larger sample size of 17\u201320 studies is recommended to detect small effects (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ), the alignment of these findings suggests that the current findings are robust. \n\nStudies identified by systematic review are limited by modest participant numbers. The recommended sample size for investigating sensorimotor effects with 3T scanners is a minimum of 20 participants, and preferably 27 participants (Thirion et\u00a0al.,  ). The average number of participants recruited in the studies contributing to this meta\u2010analysis was 15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.63 (M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0\u2009SD) with only three studies (Mueller et\u00a0al.,  ; Yang et\u00a0al.,  ,  ) recruiting 20 participants or more. Therefore, contributing foci are potentially underpowered. However, a leave\u2010one\u2010out analysis was conducted to assess the sensitivity of results (Supporting Information  ; Acar et\u00a0al.,  ), which demonstrated that clusters in the right SII and left SI/IPL were stable across all 13 studies. During leave\u2010one\u2010out analyses, additional clusters were identified in the left SII and left DLPFC and SI/MI, which may indicate that bilateral SII and higher order prefrontal regions are important for texture processing. However, the identification of concordant activation in these areas may be dependent on task design and/or stimuli utilized, hence the sensitivity to leave\u2010one\u2010out procedures. Thus, the importance of a standardized procedure in the field of texture processing is highlighted. \n\nTo conclude, findings revealed expected concordance\u00a0in sensorimotor areas including higher order structures associated with top\u2010down mechanisms. Analysis of studies that included a haptic baseline to control for non\u2010textual processing revealed concordance solely in the left SII. Furthermore, the contrast analysis demonstrated that lateral SI and IPL are significantly more predominant when utilizing a resting baseline than in studies where textural aspects of discriminative touch are accounted for in the baseline. These findings point toward the preferential processing of texture in higher order structures, particularly the SII. Further research should carefully consider research design, and particularly the use of appropriate baseline contrasts to uncover the role of higher order structures in texture processing. Overall, the present study has furthered our understanding of texture perception, specifically when accounting for the influence of other haptic processes that offer unique insight into the neural correlates of texture\u2010related processing. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \n Jessica Henderson  : Conceptualization, methodology, formal analysis, investigation, data curation, writing\u2014original draft, writing\u2014review and editing, visualization, project administration.
