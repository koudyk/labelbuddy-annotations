However, findings were inconsistent in each group and cannot be compared to each other. We first identified neuroimaging experiments that revealed abnormal neural activities during emotional processing in patients with major depressive disorder published from January 1997 to January 2019. Then we conducted voxel-wise meta-analyses on adult and youth patients separately and compared the two age groups using direct meta-comparison. Fifty-four studies comprising 1141 patients and 1242 healthy controls were identified. Both adult and youth patients showed abnormal neural activities in anterior cingulate cortex, insula, superior and middle temporal gyrus, and occipital cortex compared to healthy controls. However, hyperactivities in the superior and middle frontal gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampus were only observed in adult patients, while hyperactivity in the striatum was only found in youth patients compared to controls. In addition, compared with youths, adult patients exhibited significantly greater abnormal activities in insula, middle frontal gyrus, and hippocampus, and significantly lower abnormal activities in middle temporal gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, and striatum. The common alterations confirmed the negative processing bias in major depressive disorder. Both adult and youth patients were suggested to have disturbed emotional perception, appraisal, and reactivity. However, adult patients might be more subject to the impaired appraisal and reactivity processes, while youth patients were more subject to the impaired perception process. These findings help us understand the progressive pathophysiology of major depressive disorder.
