Recently, fMRI has been used to examine abnormal activation of brain regions in patients with ITN. However, sample sizes have been small in these few studies, and the abnormally activated brain regions remain unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we retrieved and analyzed literature on the brain areas with abnormal or reduced activation in ITN patients, with the aim of providing insight into the neuropathological basis of the disease and to provide new targets for treatment. We retrieved resting state fMRI studies on trigeminal neuralgia patients from PubMed, the Web of Science and Scopus databases until November 2022, and we extracted the coordinates of the sites with increased or decreased activation. We used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to identify regions of abnormal activation in ITN patients. ALE meta-analysis revealed that the left caudate nucleus and right anterior ventral nucleus of the thalamus are abnormally hyperactivated in ITN patients. Moreover, ITN patients showed reduced activation in the left precuneus, middle temporal gyrus, lingual gyrus, and medial frontal gyrus. ALE meta-analysis identified several brain regions with abnormally high or decreased activation in ITN patients. Sites with altered activation may be potential targets for non-invasive brain stimulation as adjunct therapy for ITN.
