Consequently, for biomedical researchers\nwishing to relate their experimental results to relevant data lurking somewhere within\nthis expanding universe of on-line information, the ability to access and navigate\nbiomedical information sources in an efficient manner has become increasingly\nimportant. Natural language and text processing techniques can facilitate this task\nby making the information contained in textual resources such as MEDLINE\nmore readily accessible and amenable to computational processing. Names of\nbiological entities such as genes and proteins provide critical links between different\nbiomedical information sources and researchers' experimental data. Therefore,\nautomatic identification and classification of these terms in text is an essential\ncapability of any natural language processing system aimed at managing the wealth\nof biomedical information that is available electronically. To support term recognition\nin the biomedical domain, we have developed Termino, a large-scale terminological\nresource for text processing applications, which has two main components: first, a\ndatabase into which very large numbers of terms can be loaded from resources such\nas UMLS, and stored together with various kinds of relevant information; second,\na finite state recognizer, for fast and efficient identification and mark-up of terms\nwithin text. Since many biomedical applications require this functionality, we have\nmade Termino available to the community as a web service, which allows for its\nintegration into larger applications as a remotely located component, accessed through\na standardized interface over the web. \n \n\n# Body\n\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 2448598, "text_md5": "ead13a4bcd5fb60b756489c643e76d05", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 67], "journal": [68, 87], "publication_year": [89, 93], "title": [104, 145], "keywords": [159, 159], "abstract": [172, 1938], "body": [1947, 1947]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 18629294, "doi": "10.1002/cfg.459", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2448598", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=2448598"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2448598\">2448598</a>", "list_title": "PMC2448598  A Web Service for Biomedical Term Look-Up"}
