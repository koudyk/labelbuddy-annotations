Delineating the neural correlates of different stages of reward processing is imperative for understanding the neurobiological mechanism underlying alcohol use disorder (AUD). To examine the neural correlates of monetary anticipation and outcome in AUD patients, we performed two separate voxel-wise meta-analyses of functional neuroimaging studies, including 12 studies investigating reward anticipation and 7 studies investigating reward outcome using the monetary incentive delay task. During the anticipation stage, AUD patients displayed decreased activation in response to monetary cues in mesocortical-limbic circuits and sensory areas, including the ventral striatum (VS), insula, hippocampus, inferior occipital gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, lingual gyrus and fusiform gyrus. During the outcome stage, AUD patients exhibited reduced activation in the dorsal striatum, VS and insula, and increased activation in the orbital frontal cortex and medial temporal area. Our findings suggest that different activation patterns are associated with nondrug rewards during different reward processing stages, potentially reflecting a changed sensitivity to monetary reward in AUD.
