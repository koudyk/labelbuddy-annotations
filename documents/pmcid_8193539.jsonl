There is an abundance of applied research focusing on the metamemory judgments and very diverse studies including a wide range of clinical populations. However, the neural correlates that support its functioning are not well defined impeding the implementation of noninvasive neuromodulatory clinical interventions. To address the neural basis of metamemory judgments, we ran a meta\u2010analysis, where we used the activation likelihood estimation method on the 19 eligible functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. The main analysis of retrospective confidence revealed concordant bilateral activation in the parahippocampal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and right amygdala. We also run an analysis between the two extreme levels of confidence, namely, high and low. This additional analysis was exploratory, since the minimum amount of articles reporting these two levels was not reached. Activations for the exploratory high\u2009>\u2009low confidence subtraction analysis were the same as observed in the main analysis on retrospective confidence, whereas the exploratory low\u2009>\u2009high subtraction showed distinctive activations of the right precuneus. The involvement of the right precuneus emphasizes its role in the evaluation of low confidence memories, as suggested by previous studies. Overall, our study contributes to a better understanding of the specific brain structures involved in confidence evaluations. Better understanding of the neural basis of metamemory might eventually lead to designing more precise neuromodulatory interventions, significantly improving treatment of patients suffering from metamemory problems. \n  \nMetamemory and more specifically retrospective confidence judgments are crucial in many aspects of our daily life and also in clinical populations. Previous meta\u2010analyses combined different measures of metamemory, which may have distorted their results. Retrospective confidence evaluations involve a concordant bilateral activation of the parahippocampal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and right amygdala. Future studies should focus on other particular metamemory measures to solve the domain\u2010generality or domain\u2010specificity of the brain basis of metamemory.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nMetamemory can be defined as the knowledge we have about our memory, how it works and which strategies we need to implement in order to maximize it (Nelson & Narens,  ). Metamemory is one of the most important superior cognitive functions due to its relevance in our daily life, particularly in the selection of encoding and retrieval strategies (Pannu & Kaszniak,\u00a0 ). For example, when we are learning new material (e.g., vocabulary of another language) we have to decide whether we have studied enough to remember it later. If we believe that we have invested enough time in learning, we will stop studying, whereas in the contrary case we will continue studying it or try a different approach. Moreover, understanding metamemory is essential for clinical populations\u2014wrong beliefs about how memory works are transformed into a wrong perception of reality (Moritz, Woodward, Jelinek, & Klige,\u00a0 ). In the rehabilitation of memory processes, awareness of their deficit in the metacognitive processes increases the benefits from rehabilitation (Clare & Woods,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe seminal work about the neural basis for metamemory was initiated by Shimamura and Squire (1986) Korsakoff syndrome patients using \u201cfeeling of knowing judgments,\u201d that is, the confidence in recognizing current inaccessible information. Later on, many studies on metamemory measures have been conducted with schizophrenia patients, reporting that these patients are unaware of their damage on memory (Moritz & Woodward,\u00a0 ; Moritz, Woodward, & Chen,\u00a0 ). In particular, patients with schizophrenia suffer from the so\u2010called \u201cconfidence gap,\u201d that is the impairment to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers, which is reflected in high confidence ratings for their incorrect answers and low confidence for the correct ones. This phenomenon has been observed with remember\u2010known tasks (Moritz & Woodward,\u00a0 ), numeric confidence scales (Moritz et al.,\u00a0 ), and it has been replicated even in patients that only suffered from a single schizophrenic episode (Moritz, Woodward, & Chen,\u00a0 ). The robustness of this effect with different measures and particularly at different degree levels pointed to the prefrontal cortex as the hub for confidence assessment, since it is an area also affected in Korsakoff patients. \n\nThese and other early works on clinical patients were crucial in advancing research on the neural basis of metamemory, and also in understanding that metamemory is a process per se, independent of the memory performance (Shimamura & Squire, 1986). However, using only clinical populations, it is impossible to accurately determine the neural basis of metamemory during its normal functioning. \n\nThe number of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on metamemory increased over the past few decades. However, different studies vary greatly in the experimental tasks used to measure metamemory, making it difficult to draw unified conclusions. For example, one can make judgments of metamemory prospectively, that is, estimations of the recallability of an item just presented (judgments of learning) in a later memory test. Kao, Davis, and Gabrieli\u00a0( ) presented their participants with scenes and asked them to evaluate if they would recognize those images later. The results point to a distinctive activation of the medial temporal lobe, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, as well as lateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in association with the prediction of future memory. Moreover, one can also make judgments monitoring current performance, that is, subjective evaluations of the correctness of an answer\u2014retrospective confidence\u2014, retrospective confidence is purportedly subserved by the anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (Fleming & Dolan,\u00a0 ). Hence, while both prospective and retrospective metamemory judgments are metacognitive measures, fMRI findings suggest that the temporality of the judgments of metamemory recruit different brain structures (Fleming & Dolan,\u00a0 ; Le Berre et al.,\u00a0 ; Pannu, Kaszniak, & Rapcsak,\u00a0 ). \n\nWithin the metamemory judgments the retrospective confidence judgments have been investigated in the various contexts, such as academic performance (Arnold, Higham, & Mart\u00edn\u2010Luengo,\u00a0 ; Mihalca & Mengelkamp,\u00a0 ; Mihalca, Mengelkamp, & Schnotz,\u00a0 ; Robey, Dougherty, & Buttaccio,\u00a0 ), eyewitness testimony and identification (Greenspan & Loftus,\u00a0 ; Luna & Mart\u00edn\u2010Luengo,\u00a0 ; Luna, Mart\u00edn\u2010Luengo, & Brewer,\u00a0 ; Semmler, Brewer, & Wells,\u00a0 ), as well as various clinical populations (multiple sclerosis: Mazancieux, Souchay, Casez, & Moulin,\u00a0 ; psychosis: Dietrichkeit, Grzella, Nagel, & Moritz,\u00a0 ; Alzheimer: Bertrand et al.,\u00a0 ; obsessive compulsive disorder: Moritz & Jaeger,\u00a0 ). This suggests that metacognition and particularly retrospective confidence judgments are important in a great deal of tasks in daily life, and thus, this fMRI meta\u2010analysis focuses on the neural underpinnings of retrospective confidence judgments. \n\nTo date, there are two fMRI meta\u2010analyses on metacognition in which retrospective confidence judgments have been investigated to some extent. In White, Engen, S\u00f8rensen, Overgaard, and Shergill\u00a0( ) examined whether the brain activation was similar in what they defined as Type\u2010A research and Type\u2010B research. Type A\u2010research focused on the levels of uncertainty given by the environment (e.g., discriminability of perceptual information), while Type\u2010B research oriented to studies where confidence was measured (subjective assessment of confidence or certainty based on a particular experience). This distinction allows one to determine to which extent the objective and subjective evaluations share their brain substrates. Despite the value of the conceptualization and results of this seminal fMRI meta\u2010analysis, only nine studies were included in the Type\u2010B category. Recent research indicates that such a low number is insufficient for meta\u2010analysis and may biased results due to the overinfluence of a single study (Eickhoff, Laird, Fox, Lancaster, & Fox,\u00a0 ). \n\nMore recently, Vaccaro and Fleming\u00a0( ) published an fMRI meta\u2010analysis on metacognition, aiming at distinguishing between the type of metacognitive evaluations (memory vs. decision\u2010making), analysis type (judgment, confidence, and predictors of metacognitive sensitivity), and metamemory temporality (prospective vs. retrospective). The authors identified a cluster for the retrospective confidence judgments, involving activation of the parahippocampal the left inferior frontal gyri (see table   and figure 4 in Vaccaro & Fleming,\u00a0 ), that is, regions associated with judgments of familiarity in the recognition of novel associations (Du et al.,\u00a0 ; Haskins, Yonelinas, Quamme, & Ranganath,\u00a0 ). Vaccaro and Fleming also reported the activations between different confidence levels, but for this contrast, all types of metamemory (prospective and retrospective) were collapsed. As mentioned before, the brain activations for different temporal metamemory measures tend to be different (Chua, Schacter, & Sperling,\u00a0 ; Fleming & Dolan,\u00a0 ; Le Berre et al.,\u00a0 ; Pannu et al.,\u00a0 ). Therefore, the results of collapsing different metamemory measures to investigate the differences between high and low evaluations can convey some distortion or lack of clarity. \n\nThus, in the current meta\u2010analysis, we aimed for the most general representation of the brain activation corresponding to confidence judgment, and included quite heterogeneous studies using different experimental tasks, which lead to the representation of the activations of confidence assessment less influenced by a particular cognitive process (M\u00fcller et al.,\u00a0 ). In other words, the experiments (i.e., contrasts) included in the meta\u2010analysis are all characterized for being estimations of confidence once the main task has been completed. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Literature search and article selection \n  \nThe literature search was performed using Web of Science ( ), Scopus ( ), and PubMed ( ) search engines on 11.04.2020, with keywords (\u201cconfidence\u201d AND \u201cfMRI,\u201d \u201cuncertainty\u201d AND \u201cfMRI,\u201d \u201cunpredictability\u201d AND \u201cfMRI,\u201d \u201cdecision\u2010making\u201d AND \u201cfMRI,\u201d \u201cmetamemory\u201d AND \u201cfMRI,\u201d \u201cretrospective confidence\u201d AND \u201cfMRI,\u201d \u201cmnemonic confidence\u201d AND \u201cfMRI,\u201d \u201csubjective experience\u201d AND \u201cfMRI\u201d), during years 1998\u20132020, yielding a total of 11,217 articles (see Figure\u00a0  for PRISMA chart on step\u2010by\u2010step analysis procedure). To achieve homogeneity of imaging data, we did not search for articles that reported PET data. Next, we excluded abstracts and non\u2010English text (  n  \u00a0=\u200940), yielding 5,032 full\u2010text articles eligible for further screening. Further screening was conducted in two steps. First, we excluded articles with irrelevant topics (i.e., decision\u2010making, visual search, etc.), articles that reported data on clinical patients or with drug administration, articles that used other neuroimaging techniques (EEG and MEG), and articles that involved stimulation. This initial screening allowed us to assess the articles that were relevant to our topic more efficiently and thoroughly. During the second screening, we excluded meta\u2010analysis and reviews, articles that did not report fMRI coordinates or measured confidence outside of fMRI, articles that did not report whole brain analysis (only ROI), reported parametric contrasts, or compared different age groups. The list with the manuscripts and reasons for exclusion from this second screening can be consulted in Table   of the supplemental materials. The eligibility of the article inclusion based on topic of interest was accessed based on the following criteria: (a) subjects performed tasks in the context of retrospective confidence evaluation and meta\u2010memory; (b) statistical models for contrasts of \u201chigh>low\u201d or \u201clow>high\u201d confidence were provided. Articles meeting these criteria were reviewed by two researchers of the team (O. Z. and A. D.). We included into the analysis only articles which reported data on healthy controls (i.e., participants were free from psychiatric or neurological disorders and neuropharmacological influence). Next, we did a reference search on the articles included into analysis, yielding two additional articles (see Table\u00a0  for the detailed information on these articles). We included all relevant experiments from each article in the analysis because the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm uses a correction to avoid summation of within\u2010group effects (Turkeltaub et al.,\u00a0 ). Unfortunately, due to the low number of experiments that included the contrasts of high\u2009>\u2009low confidence (  n  \u00a0=\u200915) and low\u2009>\u2009high confidence (  n  \u00a0=\u200911), the result for these contrasts needs to be cautiously considered by other researchers in the future (see Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0  for the recommended number of experiments). \n  \nPRISMA chart illustrating the selection procedure for the articles used \n    \nDescriptive information on articles used in ALE meta\u2010analysis on retrospective confidence \n    \n\n### Activation likelihood estimate \n  \nThe meta\u2010analysis was performed using GingerALE software, version 3.0.2 (freely available at http://www.brainmap.org/ale/) which allows to perform coordinate\u2010based ALE (Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ; Eickhoff, Bzdok, Laird, Kurth, & Fox,\u00a0 ). Foci extracted from different experiments across different articles were used to create a probabilistic map comparing the likelihood of activation to random spatial distribution. All coordinates reported in MNI space were converted to Talairach space before the analysis. Statistical significance was assessed using a cluster\u2010level threshold for multiple comparisons at   p  \u00a0=\u2009.05 with a cluster\u2010forming threshold set to   p  \u00a0=\u2009.001 (Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ,  ). \n\nIn the majority of the studies included in the current meta\u2010analysis, the participants had to indicate the confidence in an old/new memory answer (  n  \u00a0=\u200911, de Zubicaray et al, 2019; Fleck,\u00a0 ; Hayes et al.,\u00a0 ; Henson et al.,\u00a0 ; Kim & Cabeza,\u00a0 ; Kuchinke et al.,\u00a0 ; Leiker & Johnson,\u00a0 ; Mugikura et al.,\u00a0 ; Pais\u2010Vieira et al.,\u00a0 ; Risius et al.,\u00a0 ; Woroch et al.,\u00a0 ; Yonelinas,\u00a0 ), or to report confidence in their answer to other tasks (  n  \u00a0=\u200918, Chua et al.,\u00a0 ; Chua et al.,\u00a0 ; Chua et al.,\u00a0 ; de Zubicaray et al, 2019; Fleck,\u00a0 ; Hayes et al.,\u00a0 ; Henson et al.,\u00a0 ; Kim & Cabeza,\u00a0 ; Kim & Cabeza,\u00a0 ; Kuchinke et al.,\u00a0 ; Leiker & Johnson,\u00a0 ; Molenberghs et al.,\u00a0 ; Moritz, Gl\u00e4scher, et al.,\u00a0 ; Moritz, Woodward, & Chen,\u00a0 ; Pais\u2010Vieira et al.,\u00a0 ; Risius et al.,\u00a0 ; Woroch et al.,\u00a0 ; Yonelinas,\u00a0 ; Yu et al.,\u00a0 ). Recent meta\u2010analyses (Vaccaro & Fleming,\u00a0 ; White et al.,\u00a0 ) did not include direct contrasts measured confidence (i.e., feeling of knowing, FOK, or JOL, judgment of learning) or nonparametric contrasts (i.e., \u201csignificant correlations with subjective certainty in color trials\u201d in Vaccaro & Fleming,\u00a0 ). To keep the methodology consistent, we included only experiments that used subtraction contrasts (i.e., high confidence\u2009>\u2009low confidence). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Confidence \n  \nArticles included in the main analysis reported data on 626 participants. Across articles, which reported gender, 276 were male participants. Across articles, which reported handedness, 577 were right\u2010handed. For the articles where age range was given, the median of age was 24.2\u2009years (see Table\u00a0  for detailed information). Figure\u00a0  shows the number of articles, number of experiments, and foci included in the meta\u2010analysis. \n\n\n### ALE maps for all tasks related to confidence \n  \nAll tasks related to confidence evaluation show concordance in four clusters (Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). The largest cluster with the highest ALE value is found in the left parahippocampal gyrus (BA 35 and 36). The second cluster is found in the left middle frontal gyrus (BA 46). Subcortical activation is observed in the next two clusters: in the right amygdala and right parahippocampal gyrus (BA 28, 34). \n  \nALE meta\u2010analysis of all studies on retrospective confidence \n      \nBrain maps showing significant activation likelihood estimation (ALE) values for confidence \n  \n\n### Exploratory analysis: High\u2009>\u2009low confidence and low\u2009<\u2009high confidence \n  \nAs an exploratory analysis, we estimated the two conditions included in the meta\u2010analysis: high confidence and low confidence. Previous studies suggest that these two types of confidence are underpinned by different neural substrates, such as parahippocampal gyrus or DLPFC (Kim & Cabeza,\u00a0 ). Therefore, we selected 15 studies (foci\u00a0=\u00a0174) out of the main sample, where participants reported high confidence at the retrieval/recognition stage, and 11 studies (foci\u00a0=\u00a0158)\u2014reporting low confidence. \n  \nSupplementary ALE meta\u2010analysis for high\u2009>\u2009low confidence contrasts (15 papers) \n      \nDescriptive information on articles used in exploratory analysis on high confidence\u2009>\u2009low confidence \n    \n#### ALE maps for the contrast high\u2009>\u2009low \n  \nThree subcortical clusters were identified centered at the right parahippocampal gyrus (BA 28, and amygdala), left parahippocampal gyrus (BA 36), and right caudate.

This high cognitive process is important for many different processes in both healthy and clinical populations. It is particularly vital in the clinical population, where awareness of the memory may be a prerequisite for the success of the interventions to improve memory (Clare & Woods,\u00a0 ). The variety of different measures in assessing the level of metamemory complicates the identification of the underlying brain structures, which makes it crucial to run specific meta\u2010analyses for each main category (i.e., prospective vs. retrospective) in which metamemory measures are classified (Chua et al.,\u00a0 ; Fleming & Dolan,\u00a0 ; Le Berre et al.,\u00a0 ; Pannu & Kaszniak,\u00a0 ). \n\nIn this study, we examined concordance across studies in brain areas responding to the assessment of confidence. We also ran the exploratory analysis for the directionality of confidence (high\u2009>\u2009low, low\u2009>\u2009high) in order to observe the tendency of the data, which can orient future studies. The main analysis of confidence revealed concordant bilateral activation in the parahippocampal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and right amygdala. Notice that the concordant activation we observed in our analysis closely corresponds to the concordant activation of the parahippocampal gyrus reported by Vaccaro and Fleming\u00a0( ) for metamemory judgments and, specifically, retrospective metamemory judgments. However, the rest of our results differ from theirs since we only found this concordant bilateral activation in the parahippocampal gyrus and activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus. This difference most probably stems from our criteria of inclusion\u2014we only included whole\u2010brain fMRI articles, and only those reporting subtraction contrasts. These criteria guarantee that the analyses only reveal regions associated with retrospective confidence and no other general functions involved (M\u00fcller et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nOverall, our main results confirmed the involvement of the parahippocampal gyrus and the left inferior frontal gyrus in the assessment of confidence (Fleming & Dolan,\u00a0 ; Metcalfe & Schwartz, 2015; Vaccaro & Fleming,\u00a0 ). We also confirmed the role of the medial temporal lobe in the processes of recollection of information during or prior to the confidence assessment (Cohen & Eichenbaum,\u00a0 ; Eichenbaum & Cohen,\u00a0 ). The act of retrieving information is undoubtedly required in the assessment of the confidence (Nelson,\u00a0 ); otherwise, we would not be able to evaluate the certainty of our memories. MTL has been extensively related in the recollection for declarative memories (i.e., memories for knowledge and events) and retrieval processes (Eichenbaum, Yonelinas, & Ranganath,\u00a0 ). It should be noted that the activation of structures included in the MTL only appears in the main analyses and the high\u2009>\u2009low contrast. The absence of activation of the MTL for the contrast low\u2009>\u2009high may be explained by the fact that low confidence judgments are related to the inability to retrieve the requested information. This emphasizes the involvement of MTL in retrieval and evaluation of the confidence. \n\nIn both, the main and the additional low\u2009>\u2009high confidence analyses, we found an activation of the left middle frontal gyrus (BA 46). This area is presumably in charge of the response inhibition and error monitoring in go/no\u2010go tasks (Heitzeg et al.,\u00a0 ; Le et al.,\u00a0 ), as well as in multiple different cognitive tasks spanning from working memory (Leung, Gore, & Goldman\u2010Rakic,\u00a0 ) to motor executive control (K\u00fcbler, Dixon, & Garavan,\u00a0 ). Hence, the observation of the BA 46 activation for retrospective confidence in the main and in the low\u2009>\u2009high confidence analyses but not in the high\u2009>\u2009low analysis, suggests its involvement in the negative outcome of monitoring, leading to low confidence assessment of confidence. The activation BA46 in these divergent tasks where monitoring is required, suggests that it is the most prominent area related to monitoring. \n\nOur findings for the low\u2009>\u2009high contrast are also consistent with previous work that has associated the activation of the right precuneus with low confidence in memory (Ye, Zou, Lau, Hu, & Kwok,\u00a0 ). Ye and colleagues disrupted the precuneus by the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation to examine its causal role in the meta\u2010cognition of perceptual and memory processes. They found differences in the assessment of confidence, particularly, the impairment to adequately rate low confident answers with low confidence on the memory domain. This result not only corroborates the hypothesis of the involvement of the precuneus in metamemory processes (see work of Simons, Peers, Mazuz, Berryhill, & Olson,\u00a0  on patients with bilateral parietal lesions), but also strengthens the view of a domain\u2010specificity in the assessment of metacognition (Morales, Lau, & Fleming,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n## ANALYSIS LIMITATIONS \n  \nOur study focused on the brain structures involved in the evaluation of retrospective confidence. Ideally, we should have run the analyses balancing the perceptual modality of the tasks. First, we included studies that used diverse types of materials (images or semantic information). Such a variability in underlying cognitive processes may introduce certain bias in the results, since there is an open debate on whether metacognition is a domain\u2010specific or domain\u2010general process, and whether they possibly co\u2010exist (Morales et al.,\u00a0 ). Second, as repeatedly mentioned above, the results for high\u2009>\u2009low and low\u2009>\u2009high contrasts were preliminary and should be considered with caution, because none of them reach the recommended minimum number of studies to guarantee sufficient power (17 studies; see Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ; M\u00fcller et al.,\u00a0 ). Despite these shortcomings, the current meta\u2010analysis presents new knowledge on the topic of confidence judgments, which is more advantageous compared to standard reviews. \n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nWe aimed to further clarify the particular brain structures sub serving metamemory, particularly on retrospective confidence. Our results indicated the involvement of four clusters required for the assessment of confidence (see Table\u00a0 ). Some of the regions included in these clusters have also been related to memory processes as well as to monitoring of errors and inhibition of answers, but all of them are consistent with the proposed functioning of metamemory processes (Fleming & Frith,\u00a0 ). Finally, our results can better inform future clinical research focusing on retrospective confidence failures and emphasize the need for similar studies with other types of metamemory measures. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors declare no conflict of interest. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8193539, "text_md5": "c20acdcdefbbfb8c9a82e908ea902e44", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 95], "journal": [96, 110], "publication_year": [112, 116], "title": [127, 225], "keywords": [239, 358], "abstract": [371, 2691], "body": [2700, 25621]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 33951247, "doi": "10.1002/hbm.25397", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8193539", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8193539"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8193539\">8193539</a>", "list_title": "PMC8193539  Retrospective confidence judgments: Meta\u2010analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies"}
