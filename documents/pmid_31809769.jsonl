However, a proper meta-analysis has not been conducted in this domain. In this study, we tried to respond to this need. A systematic search and a meta-analysis were carried out to estimate the central mechanism of itch. The itch matrix comprises the thalamus and the parietal, secondary somatosensory, insular and cingulate cortices. We have shown that the basal ganglia (BG) play an important role in itch reduction. Finally, we explored itch processing in AD patients and observed that the itch matrix in these patients was different. In conclusion, this is the first meta-analysis on the central mechanisms of itch perception and processing. Our study demonstrated that different modalities of itch induction can produce a common pattern of activity in the brain and provided further insights into understanding the underlying nature of itch central perception.
