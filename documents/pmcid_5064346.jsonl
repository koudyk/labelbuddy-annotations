Findings are discussed in relation to prominent theories of the neural basis of creativity. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCreative ideation, the generation of novel and useful ideas (Runco & Jaeger,  ; Stein,  ), is critical to the advancement of scientific and technological innovation, and to artistic, musical, and literary endeavors (e.g., Dietrich & Kanso,  ; Fink et\u00a0al.,  ). Its adaptive value in enabling responses to novel, infrequent events has also been noted (Jung,  ). Visual creativity refers to the generation of novel and useful mental visual imagery, which may lead to the production of novel and useful visual forms (e.g., sketches, paintings) (Aziz\u2010Zadeh, Liew & Dandekar,  ; Dake,  ; Runco and Jaeger,  ). According to Runco and Jaeger's ( ) standard definition of creativity, \u201cuseful\u201d refers to outputs that are effective or valuable in accordance with the task demands\u2014as such, this definition can encompass tasks emphasizing the functionality, esthetics, or originality of solutions (e.g., Ellamil, Dobson, Beeman, & Christoff,  ; Petsche,  ). In design, visual creativity is a key component in the generation of mental images and sketches of novel and functional products (Fish & Scrivener,  ), while in an artistic context, the esthetics of visual creative solutions are highlighted, visual creativity has significant cultural importance (Damasio,  ).Visual creativity contrasts with nonvisual creativity, where novel and useful outputs in verbal, literary, or musical domains are produced (e.g., Boccia, Piccardi, Palermo, Nori, & Palmiero,  ). Despite this distinction, creative visual imagery is thought to be a component process of creative ideation generally, including nonvisual creativity (e.g., Abraham,  ; Abraham & Windmann,  ; Finke,  ,  ). \n\nDespite the contribution of visual creativity to innovation in many domains, the underlying cognitive and neural processes remain poorly specified. An understanding of these processes may inform future studies evaluating training of the appropriate cognitive skills, or neurofeedback interventions encouraging processes associated with successful visual creativity (e.g., Gruzelier,  ). This is particularly important in populations in which visual creativity is of professional, social, or recreational value. \n\nCognitive models of creativity propose that creative ideation involves retrieval of semantic associations and their conceptual combination (Abraham,  ; Benedek & Neubauer,  ; Boden,  ; Mednick,  ; Mumford, Medeiros, & Partlow,  ), as well as executive functions including inhibition of irrelevant responses (Benedek et\u00a0al.,  ; Oberauer, S\u00fc\u03b2, Wilhelm, & Wittmann,  ), and response evaluation (Mumford et\u00a0al.,  ; Sowden, Pringle, & Gabora,  ). Independent contributions of associative and executive abilities have been supported in behavioral investigations of divergent thinking (Beaty, Silvia, Nusbaum, Jauk, & Benedek,  ; Benedek & Neubauer,  ). Proposed contributions of visual imagery to creativity have been supported by findings of positive associations between visual imagery ability and visual and verbal creative ability (Finke,  ; Gonz\u00e1lez, Campos, & P\u00e9rez,  ; Kozhevnikov, Kozhevnikov, Yu, & Blazhenkova,  ; see LeBoutillier & Marks,  , for meta\u2010analysis; Palmiero, Cardi, & Belardinelli,  ; cf. Antonietti, Bologna, & Lupi,  ). \n\nSemantic memory retrieval, visual imagery, inhibition, and evaluation are involved in many distinct tasks, not just in visual creativity. This highlights the need for careful selection of well\u2010matched control tasks in neuroimaging investigations of this ability. Control tasks involving similar or overlapping processes to visual creative tasks facilitate examination of the brain regions and cognitive processes that may be engaged to a relatively greater degree in tasks drawing on visual creativity (Abraham,  ). Visual creativity is thought to differ from nonvisual creativity (e.g., generation of verbal or musical creative outputs), and visual noncreative tasks (e.g., generation of mental imagery from memory) in which visual image generation, manipulation, and evaluation are engaged to a greater extent (Finke,  ; Gansler et\u00a0al.,  ; Kozhevnikov et\u00a0al.,  ; Palmiero, Nori, Aloisi, Ferrara, & Piccardi,  ). Based on previous neuroimaging studies of visual imagery, visual creativity may engage regions linked to these functions, including early visual cortex, fusiform, V5/MT, posterior parietal cortex, and bilateral inferior frontal cortex (Kosslyn & Thompson,  ; Mazard, Tzourio\u2010Mazoyer, Crivello, Mazoyer, & Mellet,  ; see Tomasino & Gremese,  , for meta\u2010analysis). As imagery is proposed to contribute to visual creativity in combination with semantic associative and executive processes, visual creativity may be expected to engage regions associated with visual representation of semantic concepts (e.g., left fusiform; Kan, Barsalou, Olseth Solomon, Minor, & Thompson\u2010Schill,  ), and top\u2010down modulation of visual regions involved in imagery (e.g., frontal operculum; Stokes, Thompson, Cusack, & Duncan,  ). \n\nCognitive contributions to visual creativity are likely to differ according to the specific task focus (Nusbaum & Silvia,  ; Palmiero et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). Instructions to generate functional, original, or esthetic ideas may elicit greater evaluation compared to tasks that do not specify the desired nature of generated solutions (Nusbaum & Silvia,  ). Functional tasks include design tasks in which practical solutions must be generated in response to a specified problem or need. Generating visual solutions to such problems may in turn engage relatively greater manipulation of visual imagery of existing products (Oxman,  ), inhibition of irrelevant ideas, planning, and evaluation, compared to tasks where solutions are not required to be functional or realistic (Cross,  ). Emphasizing the originality of generated solutions may engage combination of semantically distant concepts via semantic retrieval (Grabner, Fink, & Neubauer,  ; Nusbaum & Silvia,  ). \n\nProminent existing accounts of the neural basis of creativity include those emphasizing the contribution of increases (e.g., Fink & Benedek,  ) or, conversely, decreases (Jausovec & Jausovec,  ) in electroencephalography (EEG) alpha power. Others have proposed a role of right hemispheric dominance in creativity (e.g., Mihov, Denzler, & F\u00f6rster,  ), particularly visual creativity (Aziz\u2010Zadeh et al.,  ; Mendez,  ; Miller, Boone, Cummings, Read, & Mishkin,  ; Miller et\u00a0al.,  ; Seeley et\u00a0al.,  ; Shamay\u2010Tsoory, Adler, Aharon\u2010Peretz, Perry, & Mayseless,  ). Goel's ( ) related Frontal Lobe Lateralization Hypothesis posits that the right PFC maintains ill\u2010structured representations that facilitate idea generation in open\u2010ended visual design problems. Functional neuroimaging evidence for a critical role of alpha power or the right hemisphere in visual creativity has not, however, been formally synthesized. \n\nMeta\u2010analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of creativity have reported that not only overlapping regions of bilateral PFC and occipitotemporal cortex contribute to creativity across multiple domains, for example, musical, verbal, and visual (Boccia et\u00a0al.,  ; Gonen\u2010Yaacovi et\u00a0al.,  ), but have also hinted at domain\u2010specific neural contributions to these types of creativity (Boccia et\u00a0al.,  ). Given this apparent domain\u2010specificity and the importance of visual creativity, it is of value to examine the neural basis of visual creativity as distinct from other forms of creativity. Previous reviews have, however, tended to collapse across visual and verbal divergent thinking, or visual art and musical improvization (Dietrich & Kanso,  ; Gonen\u2010Yaacovi et\u00a0al.,  ; Wu et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nThe present review aimed to establish whether a common neural basis of visual creativity emerges when synthesizing studies examining neural activity associated with this creative modality only, and only studies examining active generation of visual creative ideas (Section\u00a0 ). Unlike previous fMRI meta\u2010analyses (Boccia et\u00a0al.,  ; Gonen\u2010Yaacovi et\u00a0al.,  ; Wu et\u00a0al.,  ), studies employing any neuroimaging technique were included. \n\nThe neural basis of visual creativity was assessed using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta\u2010analysis of fMRI studies, in addition to qualitative synthesis of findings from this and other neuroimaging modalities. We also evaluated support for existing accounts of cognitive and neural contributions to creativity, including right hemispheric dominance, PFC involvement, and the role of alpha power. A further aim was to expand on previous reviews by assessing evidence for (1) effects of participants\u2019 visual creative ability on the neural or electrophysiological correlates of visual creativity and (2) differences in the neural basis of visual creativity according to whether tasks emphasized the functionality, esthetics, or originality of generated visual solutions (Dietrich & Kanso,  ; Gonen\u2010Yaacovi et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Search strategy \n  \nThis systematic review and ALE meta\u2010analysis followed PRISMA guidelines (Liberati et\u00a0al.,  ) and synthesized studies recording neural activity during active generation of visual\u2010based creative (i.e., novel and useful) ideas (Runco & Jaeger,  ). Tasks involving only passive viewing of visual creative forms or their retrieval from memory were not included.   Convergent thinking  , problem\u2010solving or insight tasks, which typically have a single, fixed solution, can engage creative thinking (Abraham,  ).   Divergent thinking   or open\u2010ended tasks with multiple possible solutions, however, typically provide a closer approximation to the creativity involved in visual design, art, and innovation (e.g., Ellamil et\u00a0al.,  ; Kowatari et\u00a0al.,  ), and also meet standard definitions of creativity (Runco & Jaeger,  ). Consequently, this review focused on functional neuroimaging studies employing open\u2010ended or divergent thinking visual creativity tasks. Principal searches were conducted from 12 to 18 March 2015 in Web of Science (1864\u20132015), EMBASE (1947\u20132015), PsycINFO (1940\u20132015), PubMed (1950\u20132015), ScienceDirect (1823\u20132015), and Compendex (1884\u20132015). Search terms included \u201ccreativity,\u201d \u201cideation,\u201d \u201cill\u2010structured,\u201d \u201cdivergent thinking,\u201d \u201cidea generation\u201d (including variants of these terms), co\u2010occurring with one or more neuroimaging terms: \u201cfunctional (neuro)imaging,\u201d \u201cPET/positron emission tomography,\u201d \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging/functional MRI/fMRI,\u201d \u201celectroencephalography/EEG,\u201d \u201cevent\u2010related potential/ERP,\u201d \u201cmagnetoencephalography/MEG,\u201d and/or \u201cfunctional near infrared spectroscopy/FNIR.\u201d Further searches including the terms \u201celectrocorticography/ECoG\u201d and \u201cmultiunit activity/MUA\u201d did not yield any additional relevant results. Update searches were conducted in May and June 2015 and March 2016. \n\nThe article selection procedure is summarized in Fig.\u00a0 . Using the above search terms, 3489 records were identified and 46 were identified through reference lists of relevant studies. Following de\u2010duplication and screening for inclusion criteria (see Table\u00a0 ), 26 articles, comprising 27 experiments, were included in the review, of which six fMRI studies were included in the ALE meta\u2010analysis. No limitations were placed on the date of publication. \n  \nFlowchart of article selection, following PRISMA guidelines. Adapted from Moher et\u00a0al. ( ). fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; EEG, electroencephalography \n    \nInclusion criteria \n    \n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nIncluded experiments were rated according to quality assessment criteria adapted from Whiting, Rutjes, Reitsma, Bossuyt, and Kleijnen's ( ) QUADAS quality assessment tool: (1) clear description of participant selection criteria and demographics; (2) visual creativity task compared against a non\u2010rest/fixation control task (hereafter, \u201ccontrol task\u201d); (3) sufficient detail on task procedure for reproducibility; (4) sufficient detail on the neuroimaging procedure and outcome measures for reproducibility; (5) sufficient information on analyses and results for reproducibility; (6) conclusions justified based on analyses, for example, appropriate multiple comparisons corrections; (7) no substantial confounds between groups/conditions. Criterion (2) was selected as comparisons against a constrained non\u2010rest control task that elicits overlapping processes are thought to better facilitate isolation of processes that are unique to the task of interest than an unconstrained rest/fixation condition (Abraham,  ; Lazar,  ). For each experiment, a score of 0 (criterion not met) or 1 (criterion met) was assigned for each criterion, and the percentage of criteria met was calculated. Scores are summarized in Table S1. \n\n\n### Meta\u2010analysis strategy \n  \n#### Selection of voxels \n  \nOf the seven fMRI studies meeting inclusion criteria (see Fig.\u00a0  and Section\u00a0 ), the six (Aziz\u2010Zadeh et\u00a0al.,  ; Ellamil et\u00a0al.,  ; Gilbert, Zamenopoulos, Alexiou, & Johnson,  ; Huang et\u00a0al.,  ; Park, Kirk, & Waldie,  ; Saggar et\u00a0al.,  ) which reported 3D coordinates of peaks showing greater activity during visual creativity compared with a non\u2010rest control task were included in the ALE meta\u2010analysis. These reported 77 foci in seven contrasts (see Table\u00a0 , for tasks), involving 150 participants. \n  \nSummary of reviewed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies \n    \n\n#### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nA coordinate\u2010based ALE meta\u2010analysis was conducted using Brainmap GingerALE 2.3 ( ). ALE meta\u2010analysis uses peak coordinates from published studies to calculate brain regions in which the convergence across studies is greater than expected by chance if the included foci were independently distributed (Eickhoff, Bzdok, Laird, Kurth, & Fox,  ; Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ). Each included activation focus is modeled as the center of a 3D Gaussian distribution, the full width at half maximum of which is determined by the study's sample size (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ). Modeled activation (MA) maps are calculated by computing the maximum across the Gaussian distribution of each focus (Turkeltaub et\u00a0al.,  ). The ALE map resulting from combining the MA maps is then compared against an ALE null distribution map. A random effects model was employed (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ), and significance thresholds on the ALE scores were set via cluster\u2010level inference (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ). A cluster\u2010level threshold of   p\u00a0  <  \u00a0  .05 and cluster\u2010forming threshold of   p\u00a0  <  \u00a0  .001 were used to set the minimum cluster volume at 192\u00a0mm , via 1000 permutations. The smaller, more conservative mask size was selected. \n\nThe meta\u2010analysis was conducted in MNI space. In GingerALE 2.3, anatomical labels were assigned to ALE peaks which surpassed the voxel and cluster\u2010level thresholds using the Talairach Daemon, after transformation of significant coordinates using icbm2tal (Lancaster et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nIncluded studies comprised 7 fMRI and 19 EEG experiments. No NIRS, MEG, ERP, or PET studies met inclusion criteria. Information on participants, creative and control tasks, analyses, and results are summarized in Table\u00a0  for fMRI studies, and Table   for EEG studies. \n\n### Study characteristics \n  \nOf the 26 reviewed articles, 10 have to our knowledge not been included in previous systematic reviews or meta\u2010analyses. The 26 articles comprised 27 experiments and around 800 participants\u2014this is approximate as the studies of Bechtereva and Nagornova ( ) and Nagornova ( ), of Petsche ( ) and Petsche, Kaplan, Von Stein, and Filz ( ), and of Volf, Tarasova, and Razumnikova ( ) and Volf and Tarasova ( ) were conducted using overlapping samples, without stating numbers of participants included in both. Mean sample size was 27 (  SD\u00a0  =\u00a013) for fMRI studies, and 38 (  SD\u00a0  =\u00a013) for EEG studies. Participants were aged around 17\u201360\u00a0years (approximate as age not always reported). The most common visual creativity task was the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking\u2014Incomplete Figures (TTCT\u2010IF; Torrance,  ) or variants of this task, used in 11/27 (41%) experiments. In this task, part of Torrance's ( ) standardized battery of verbal and nonverbal creative thinking tasks, participants mentally generate a complete image from a presented fragment of a drawing. Measures of fluency (number of ideas) and originality (statistical infrequency of ideas) are typically recorded. The next most common task, employed in six (22%) experiments, involved generating images by mentally combining presented shapes. Studies differed in whether idea generation and externalization (via sketching/verbalization) occurred in the same (e.g., Park et\u00a0al.,  ; Saggar et\u00a0al.,  ) or distinct (e.g., Volf et\u00a0al.,  ) phases. Tasks included those in which solutions must fulfill a specified function (25.9%), those emphasizing the originality/fluency of solutions (51.9%; these are combined as typically task instructions emphasized both criteria, for example, \u201cgenerate as many original solutions as possible\u201d), those emphasizing the esthetics of solutions (7.4%), and tasks giving no instructions as to the desired characteristics of solutions (14.8%). On average, studies satisfied 67% of quality criteria (  SD\u00a0  =\u00a021; range 14\u2013100%; Table S1). Quality scores did not differ between fMRI (  M\u00a0  =\u00a076%,   SD\u00a0  =\u00a014) and EEG (  M\u00a0  =\u00a064%,   SD\u00a0  =\u00a023) studies (  t  (25)   \u00a0  =\u00a01.21,   p\u00a0  =  \u00a0  .24). \n\n\n### Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies \n  \n#### Functional magnetic resonance imaging study characteristics \n  \nThe participants, procedure, and main findings of the reviewed fMRI studies are summarized in Table\u00a0 . Two studies employed the TTCT\u2010IF, with instructions emphasizing the originality of generated solutions, although Huang et\u00a0al. ( ) compared activity during efforts to generate unique solutions against activity during generation of any appropriate solutions; while Park et\u00a0al. ( ) compared activity during simultaneous generation and sketching of solutions against activity during line tracing. Four studies employed tasks emphasizing a specific function of generated solutions. Of these, three were visual design tasks\u2014designing and sketching book covers (Ellamil et\u00a0al.,  ), generating pen designs (Kowatari et\u00a0al.,  ), and an ill\u2010defined room layout task (Gilbert et\u00a0al.,  ). In the study by Saggar et\u00a0al. ( ), participants were asked to draw visual representations of presented words (e.g., \u201cgraduate,\u201d \u201csnore\u201d). \n\nIn the final study (Aziz\u2010Zadeh et\u00a0al.,  ), the desired features of visual solutions were not emphasized, and brain activity was recorded from architects while they mentally combined three presented shapes to create an image. Activity during this task was compared with activity during a mental rotation task. \n\n\n#### ALE meta\u2010analysis findings \n  \nSix fMRI studies (Aziz\u2010Zadeh et\u00a0al.,  ; Ellamil et\u00a0al.,  ; Gilbert et\u00a0al.,  ; Huang et\u00a0al.,  ; Park et\u00a0al.,  ; Saggar et\u00a0al.,  ), including 77 foci from seven contrasts were included in the ALE meta\u2010analysis (Section\u00a0 ). All foci were associated with greater activity during visual creativity compared to control conditions. An additional study (Kowatari et\u00a0al.,  ) met inclusion criteria but as no differences were found between visual creativity and control tasks in experienced or novice designers, no foci were included in the meta\u2010analysis. Three included studies employed tasks emphasizing the function of solutions, two emphasized originality/fluency, and one had no clear focus\u2014the numbers of studies in each of these categories were insufficient for analysis of effects of task focus. The meta\u2010analysis revealed seven clusters that surpassed the significance threshold (see Section\u00a0 , for thresholding and analysis). Results are summarized in Table\u00a0  and significant clusters are displayed in Fig.\u00a0 . Regions showing significant ALE activity included thalamocortical nucleus, right middle and inferior frontal gyri, cingulate gyrus, and left fusiform gyrus. \n  \nClusters showing significant activation likelihood estimate (ALE) values for the contrast of visual creativity\u00a0>\u00a0non\u2010rest control tasks \n      \nThresholded ALE map (cluster\u2010level threshold   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05, cluster\u2010forming threshold   p\u00a0  <\u00a0.001, uncorrected at the voxel level), showing significant clusters for the contrast of visual creativity versus non\u2010rest control tasks. Results are illustrated using the \u201cch256\u201d template supplied with MRIcroGL software ( ). Cluster numbers correspond to those listed in Table\u00a0 : (1) mediodorsal thalamic nucleus; (2) right middle frontal gyrus; (3) right precentral gyrus; (4) left fusiform gyrus; (5) left angular gyrus; (6) right inferior frontal gyrus; (7) left cingulate gyrus. See Table\u00a0  for MNI coordinates of maxima, cluster sizes, and corresponding ALE values \n  \nFor each significant ALE cluster, only two studies from a subset of three (Ellamil et\u00a0al.,  ; Park et\u00a0al.,  ; Saggar et\u00a0al.,  ) contributed foci which fell within the cluster boundaries. This meets the previously suggested quality criterion of a contribution of 33% of included studies for reporting ALE maxima (Brooks et\u00a0al.,  ; Van der Laan, De Ridder, Viergever, & Smeets,  ), and further foci from other studies which were out with the cluster boundaries may still have contributed to their significance (Brooks et\u00a0al.,  ). However, due to the possibility that only a minority of studies contributed to the meta\u2010analysis findings, a qualitative synthesis of fMRI findings is reported below. \n\n\n#### Qualitative synthesis \n  \nEvidence of greater occipitotemporal engagement during visual creativity compared to control tasks was reported in five of the seven fMRI studies, with activation peaks observed in right middle occipital gyrus (MOG) (Ellamil et\u00a0al.,  ; Huang et\u00a0al.,  ; Park et\u00a0al.,  ), left MOG (Ellamil et\u00a0al.,  ), bilateral inferior temporal gyri (Park et\u00a0al.,  ), and left lateral occipital cortex (Aziz\u2010Zadeh et\u00a0al.,  ; Saggar et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nTwo studies reported greater medial temporal lobe activity during visual creativity compared to control tasks. Ellamil et\u00a0al. ( ) reported greater hippocampal and parahippocampal activity during generation compared to evaluation of visual book cover designs, and Park et\u00a0al. ( ) reported greater right parahippocampal activity during generation and sketching of TTCT\u2010IF solutions compared to line tracing. Studies that involved simultaneous sketching and idea generation reported recruitment of left insular cortex, bilateral cerebellum, and thalamus (Park et\u00a0al.,  ; Saggar et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nRegions of left PFC, including superior frontal gyrus (SFG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), (Aziz\u2010Zadeh et\u00a0al.,  ), middle frontal gyrus (MFG) (Park et\u00a0al.,  ; Saggar et\u00a0al.,  ), and premotor cortex (Aziz\u2010Zadeh et\u00a0al.,  ; Ellamil et\u00a0al.,  ) were reported in five of seven studies to show greater activity during visual creativity compared to control tasks, and Huang et\u00a0al. ( ) reported that left MFG and IFG were more active during generation of original compared to standard responses. Saggar et\u00a0al. ( ) found that left MFG and IFG activity increased along with increases in subjective ratings of task difficulty, while activity in a left dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) cluster was positively associated with independent ratings of how well drawings met task demands. \n\nFewer studies reported right PFC (3/7) compared to left PFC engagement (5/7), but the meta\u2010analysis findings are indicative of greater between\u2010study consistency in the localization of right PFC regions. Two studies assessed the lateralization of PFC contributions to visual creativity. Kowatari et\u00a0al. ( ) reported greater activity during pen design in right compared to left PFC and parietal regions of interest (ROIs) (subregions and Brodmann areas not reported) in art and design students (\u201cexperts\u201d), but not in novices. The extent of right over left PFC dominance correlated with ratings of the originality of pen designs, interpreted as facilitation of visual creativity in experts via heightened right PFC activity. However, as Kowatari et\u00a0al. ( ) in fact observed no significant differences in activity at the whole\u2010brain level between the design and control task, nor between experts and novices, their findings do not speak directly to the activity supporting visual creativity\u2014the greater right PFC activity in experts may be a global effect which is not specific to visual creativity. Furthermore, the authors did not test the Hemisphere\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Group interaction which would be necessary to support right hemispheric dominance in experts only. \n\nHuang et\u00a0al. ( ) reported greater activity in left compared to right medial PFC (mPFC) ROIs under instructions to produce original solutions, while the opposite pattern emerged while producing standard solutions. A left over right inhibitory mechanism was proposed, but again the relevant Hemisphere\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Task interaction was not assessed. \n\n\n\n### Electroencephalography studies \n  \n#### Electroencephalography study characteristics \n  \nNineteen EEG studies comprising 20 experiments were reviewed. The main findings are summarized in Table\u00a0 . Most experiments (60%) employed tasks emphasizing the originality and/or fluency of solutions, including the TTCT\u2010IF or similar variants, or mental combination of shapes to form original images. In two studies (Bhattacharya & Petsche,  ; Petsche et\u00a0al.,  , Experiment 1), participants generated esthetically pleasing images, while in three studies, participants generated functional solutions, for example, generating a novel visual intelligence test (Jaarsveld et\u00a0al.,  ) or a visual representation of an abstract concept (Petsche,  ; Petsche et\u00a0al.,  , Experiment 3). \n  \nSummary of reviewed electroencephalography (EEG) studies. Unless otherwise stated, \u201cbaseline\u201d refers to fixation \n    \nMost experiments employed measures of EEG power (25%), coherence (35%), or both (35%). EEG power refers to the amplitude of a particular frequency band, while coherence, or phase synchrony, instead reflects functional cooperation between cortical regions. These measures were most often recorded for the lower (~8\u201310\u00a0Hz) and upper (~10\u201314\u00a0Hz) alpha bands (e.g., Jausovec,  ; Petsche et\u00a0al.,  ). Several studies reported effects in the delta (<4\u00a0Hz), theta (4\u20137\u00a0Hz), beta (14\u201331\u00a0Hz), and gamma bands (>31\u00a0Hz). \n\nStudies varied substantially in the control tasks employed, and the focus of key contrasts. Several compared activity during visual creativity to a verbal creativity or verbal and/or visual control task, often involving memory or convergent thinking (e.g., Jausovec,  ; Nagornova,  ). Many, however, simply compared electrophysiological activity during visual creativity against a baseline fixation/rest condition (e.g., Bhattacharya & Petsche,  ; Jausovec & Jausovec,  ; Kozhedub, Sviderskaya, & Taratynova,  ). Eight studies compared activity between individuals of high and low creativity and six compared generation of original versus standard creative images. \n\nThere were insufficient experiments employing functional or esthetic task foci for direct comparison with studies emphasizing originality/fluency of solutions, but no clear differences in qualitative findings emerged when examining tasks focusing on originality/fluency separately from other studies. The summary of findings below therefore combines across task foci, and is organized according to outcome measures (power, coherence; other), and the main contrasts employed: (1) visual creativity versus baseline rest/fixation; (2) visual creativity versus non\u2010rest control task(s); (3) individuals of high versus low creativity; (4) generation of original versus standard visual images. \n\n\n#### Findings\u2014Electroencephalography power \n  \nFigure\u00a0  summarizes the numbers of studies where a substantial majority of significant effects on EEG power across electrodes were (1) increases, (2) decreases (hereafter, \u201cpredominant power increases\u201d and \u201cpredominant power decreases,\u201d respectively), and (3) where null effects or no clear pattern of power increases or decreases emerged. These outcomes are summarized for each of the main contrast types (Section\u00a0 ). \n  \nSummary of the frequency (number of contrasts showing relevant effect) with which studies reported predominant increases (\u2191), predominant decreases (\u2193), and no clear pattern of increases or decreases (\u2212) in power in each frequency band. Findings of power changes during visual creativity versus baseline are displayed in blue; power changes versus control tasks in red; differences between high\u2010 and low\u2010creativity participants in green; and differences between production of original versus standard images in purple \n  \n##### Visual creativity versus baseline \n  \nIn the low\u2010frequency delta and theta bands and the lower and upper alpha bands, a consistent pattern of decreases in EEG power during visual creativity compared to baseline fixation or rest\u2014  task\u2010related desynchronization   (TRD) emerged across studies (Jaarsveld et\u00a0al.,  ; Jausovec & Jausovec,  ; Petsche et\u00a0al.,  ; Volf & Tarasova,  ,  ; Volf et\u00a0al.,  ). Predominant increases in power versus baseline,   task\u2010related synchronization   (TRS), were observed in the high\u2010frequency beta and gamma bands (Molle, Marshall, Wolf, Fehm, & Born,  ; Nagornova,  ; Razumnikova, Volf, & Tarasova,  ,  ; Sviderskaya,  ; Volf & Tarasova,  ). These TRD and TRS effects were typically widespread over multiple electrode sites, including bilateral frontal, central, and occipital sites. Two studies, however, reported that alpha (Volf et\u00a0al.,  ) and theta (Volf & Tarasova,  ) TRD during visual creativity versus baseline was of greater magnitude at posterior compared to anterior sites. Consistent with greater posterior effects, Molle et\u00a0al. ( ) reported task\u2010related increases in beta power at parieto\u2010occipital sites only. \n\n\n##### Visual creativity versus control \n  \nSeveral studies compared activity during visual creativity to that during verbal creativity (Jausovec & Jausovec,  ; Razumnikova et\u00a0al.,  ,  ), or during verbal and/or visual convergent problem\u2010solving or memory tasks (Molle et\u00a0al.,  ; Nagornova,  ). Molle et\u00a0al. ( ) observed reduced delta and theta power for divergent compared to convergent thinking tasks, as well as increased upper beta power over central parietal sites, these effects did not differ according to the modality (visual, verbal) of divergent and convergent tasks. Other findings point to greater task\u2010related power reductions in the theta (Razumnikova et\u00a0al.,  ) and lower and upper alpha bands (Jausovec & Jausovec,  ) for visual compared to verbal creative tasks. The latter reductions in upper alpha power were observed over occipital and left frontal sites only. \n\nConsistent with Molle et\u00a0al.'s ( ) findings of increased upper beta power during visual and verbal creativity, Nagornova ( ) observed greater power in the upper beta band, and in the lower and upper alpha and gamma bands when comparing visual creativity to drawing figures from memory. Razumnikova et\u00a0al. ( ) also reported creativity\u2010related upper beta power increases, but these increases were reduced in magnitude for visual compared to verbal tasks. Molle et\u00a0al. ( ) and Razumnikova et\u00a0al. ( ) did not reveal significant power differences between visual creative and control tasks in the alpha and beta bands, respectively (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nTwo studies compared generation of original and standard solutions to visual creative tasks. Volf and Tarasova ( ) found that under conditions of reward for producing original solutions, baseline and task\u2010related theta power were reduced and baseline alpha power increased, compared to conditions of no reward. That these effects observed at baseline and during task performance are consistent with a role of preparatory processes when a reward is offered. Reward was also associated with reduced theta and beta power during task performance only. Razumnikova et\u00a0al. ( ) found that alpha TRD versus baseline was of lesser magnitude under instructions to produce original solutions to the TTCT\u2010IF. \n\n\n##### Comparisons of high\u2010 and low\u2010creativity participants \n  \nIn the alpha band, greater power (Jausovec,  ; Sviderskaya, Taratynova, & Kozhedub,  ) or reduced alpha TRD versus baseline (Petsche et\u00a0al.,  ) was observed for artists compared to novices or for participants of high compared to low visual creativity, as measured by originality ratings of generated solutions. Volf et\u00a0al. ( ) reported opposite effects of creative ability in male and female participants. In males, high creativity (based on originality scores) was associated with greater upper alpha TRD compared to low\u2010creativity participants, while females of low creativity showed greater TRD compared to high\u2010creativity females. A tendency for greater TRD in posterior compared to anterior sites was also reported\u2014in men, this was exhibited by high\u2010creativity individuals only in the lower and upper alpha bands. However, as Volf et\u00a0al. ( ) divided participants based on median splits of originality scores performed separately for males and females, it is unclear if originality scores were comparable between high\u2010 and low\u2010creativity men and women, and so differential effects of creativity in each group must be interpreted with caution. \n\nIn the theta and beta bands, Sviderskaya et\u00a0al. ( ) observed greater power for art students compared to novices. These beta effects contrast with those of Molle et\u00a0al. ( ), who reported greater beta power for individuals of low compared to high creativity. \n\n\n##### Trends across contrast types \n  \nAfter collapsing across the above contrast types, the percentage of studies reporting predominant power increases, decreases, or no clear effects differed across the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands (  p\u00a0  =  \u00a0  .016, Fisher's exact test). As only two studies reported gamma effects, these were excluded from this test, and the test collapsed across the lower and upper alpha bands, and separately, the lower and upper beta bands due to similar patterns in each. The observed effect reflected the observation that decreased power during visual creativity (vs. baseline, vs. control, original vs. standard solutions, high\u2010 vs. low\u2010creativity participants) was reported in the majority of studies examining effects in the delta (75%), theta (77.8%), and alpha (58.8%) bands, whereas in the beta band, most studies instead reported increased power (62.5%). \n\nAs specific predictions have been made regarding the role of the alpha band in creativity (see  ), we assessed whether the percentage of studies reporting predominant alpha increases, decreases, or neither differed according to the contrast type. For the lower and upper alpha bands, the distribution of outcomes differed across contrasts (  p  s\u00a0<\u00a0.001, Fisher's exact test)\u2014100% of studies examining lower and upper alpha power during visual creativity versus baseline reported power reductions, while 75% of studies comparing high\u2010 and low\u2010creativity individuals instead reported greater power in the former group. \n\n\n\n#### Findings\u2014Electroencephalography coherence \n  \nThe numbers of studies showing predominant coherence increases, decreases, or no clear pattern for the main contrast types are displayed in Fig.\u00a0 . \n  \nSummary of the frequency (number of contrasts showing relevant effect) with which studies reported predominant increases (\u2191), predominant decreases (\u2193), and no clear pattern of increases or decreases (\u2212) in coherence in each frequency band. Findings of coherence changes during visual creativity versus baseline are displayed in blue; coherence changes versus control tasks in red; differences between high\u2010 and low\u2010creativity participants in green; and differences between production of original versus standard images in purple \n  \n##### Visual creativity versus baseline \n  \nFor the low\u2010frequency delta and theta bands, a tendency toward widespread inter\u2010 and intrahemispheric coherence increases during visual creativity compared to baseline emerged (Bechtereva & Nagornova,  ; Bhattacharya & Petsche,  ; Kozhedub et\u00a0al.,  ; Petsche,  ; Razumnikova et\u00a0al.,  ; Sviderskaya,  ). Petsche ( ) also noted some decreases in delta and theta frontal interhemispheric coherence. Volf, Tarasova, and Razumnikova ( ) noted predominant increases in theta coherence in participants of high visual creativity, while low\u2010creativity participants showed predominant theta coherence decreases. \n\nFindings were less consistent in the alpha range. For lower and upper alpha, roughly equal numbers of studies reported predominant coherence increases (Petsche,  ; Sviderskaya,  ), decreases (Bechtereva & Nagornova,  ; Kozhedub et\u00a0al.,  ), and no clear pattern of coherence changes (Bhattacharya & Petsche,  ; Razumnikova et\u00a0al.,  ; see Fig.\u00a0 ). Despite these inconsistencies, the foci of both inter\u2010 and intrahemispheric coherence increases and decreases were often at frontal sites, including long\u2010range intra\u2010 and interhemispheric coherence increases with frontal foci (Petsche et\u00a0al.,  ; Sviderskaya,  ), and frontal interhemispheric decreases and increases (Petsche et\u00a0al.,  ). Kozhedub et\u00a0al. ( ) found that task\u2010related changes in coherence versus baseline were correlated between right frontal and right parietal sites. Volf et\u00a0al. ( ) reported predominant task\u2010related lower alpha coherence increases for high\u2010creativity participants and decreases for low\u2010creativity participants, indicating that individual differences in creativity or strategy use, in addition to task differences contribute to discrepancies between studies. Across both high\u2010 and low\u2010creativity groups, however, task\u2010related upper alpha coherence decreases were observed (Volf et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nFindings were again mixed for the lower beta range, with both predominant coherence increases (Bhattacharya & Petsche,  ; Petsche,  ; Sviderskaya,  ) and decreases (Bechtereva & Nagornova,  ; Kozhedub et\u00a0al.,  ), as well as findings of no clear pattern (Razumnikova et\u00a0al.,  ; Volf et\u00a0al.,  ). The picture for upper beta was slightly clearer, with predominant coherence increases reported by six of nine studies (Bhattacharya & Petsche,  ; Kozhedub et\u00a0al.,  ; Petsche,  ; Razumnikova et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Sviderskaya,  ). Although Razumnikova et\u00a0al. ( ) observed predominant coherence increases, some interhemispheric frontal coherence decreases were also reported. Two of the three studies examining gamma coherence versus baseline reported predominant increases (Bhattacharya & Petsche,  ; Petsche,  ; cf. Bechtereva & Nagornova,  ). \n\n\n##### Visual creativity versus control \n  \nSviderskaya ( ) reported overall increases in delta and alpha coherence during visual creativity compared to a visual convergent thinking task. Bechtereva and Nagornova ( ) reported greater theta and alpha coherence during generation of original images from simple elements compared to generating images from memory. These effects differences consisted of widespread inter\u2010 and intrahemispheric increases, with foci at right frontal and, for alpha coherence, left parietal sites. Jausovec and Jausovec ( ) in contrast reported decreased alpha coherence during the TTCT\u2010IF compared to verbal creativity tasks. In the upper alpha band, these decreases were prominent between right frontal and bilateral parietal sites, although interhemispheric coherence increases were also observed between frontal sites. For the beta and gamma band, Bechtereva and Nagornova ( ) observed primarily left intrahemispheric coherence increases, with left temporal foci, alongside marked short\u2010 and long\u2010range interhemispheric coherence reductions. \n\nIn comparisons of visual versus verbal creative tasks, Razumnikova et\u00a0al. ( ) reported increased theta coherence during the TTCT\u2010IF compared to a sentence generation task, while Razumnikova et\u00a0al. ( ) observed greater upper beta coherence over frontal sites during the verbal remote associates task compared to the TTCT\u2010IF. During the TTCT\u2010IF, Razumnikova et\u00a0al. ( ) reported increased upper beta coherence when generating original compared to standard figures. This was largely driven by right hemisphere intrahemispheric increases in female participants. \n\n\n##### Comparisons of high\u2010 and low\u2010creativity participants \n  \nBoth studies examining effects of creative ability on delta coherence during visual creativity versus baseline reported greater coherence in high\u2010 compared to low\u2010creativity individuals (Bhattacharya & Petsche,  ; Sviderskaya et\u00a0al.,  ). Bhattacharya and Petsche ( ) found that these coherence differences were focused on posterior occipitotemporal sites, and took the form of inter\u2010 and intrahemispheric connections. A similar pattern of greater coherence in high\u2010 versus low\u2010creativity participants emerged in the theta band (Sviderskaya et\u00a0al.,  ; Volf et\u00a0al.,  ), although Bhattacharya and Petsche ( ) reported no clear difference between groups in theta coherence. \n\nFor the lower alpha band, three of the four studies reported greater coherence in creative individuals (Jausovec,  ; Sviderskaya et\u00a0al.,  ; Volf et\u00a0al.,  ; cf. Bhattacharya & Petsche,  ). Jausovec ( ) observed greater interhemispheric frontal coherence in high\u2010creativity participants, who also showed coherence increases versus baseline between bilateral frontal and midline parietal sites. Volf et\u00a0al. ( ) observed greater intrahemispheric coherence in high\u2010 versus low\u2010creativity participants due to the tendency of the former group to show increased intrahemispheric coherence versus baseline, while the latter showed reduced task\u2010related coherence versus baseline. \n\nThe picture was less consistent for the higher frequency ranges. For upper alpha, there were two reports of greater coherence in high\u2010 versus low\u2010creativity participants (Sviderskaya et\u00a0al.,  ; Volf et\u00a0al.,  ), one of reduced coherence (Jausovec,  ), and Petsche et\u00a0al. ( ) reported no differences between groups. Bhattacharya and Petsche ( ) reported overall coherence reductions at frontal sites in artists versus novices across the alpha band. \n\nSviderskaya et\u00a0al. ( ) and Bhattacharya and Petsche ( ) reported increased coherence in high\u2010 compared to low\u2010creativity participants across the beta range, although in the latter study this effect was restricted to right temporal sites, and reduced beta coherence was observed in artists versus novices over frontal sites. This study also provided the only examination of creative ability effects on gamma coherence, reporting reduced coherence over frontal sites in artists versus novices. \n\nSviderskaya ( ) and Sviderskaya et\u00a0al. ( ) examined effects of creative ability on   spatial synchronization   (SS) and/or   spatial disordering   (SD), measures of coherence based on linear and nonlinear relationships, respectively. Both found that artists compared to novices showed greater task\u2010related increases in coherence versus baseline, particularly over right frontal and occipital sites. \n\n\n##### Trends across contrasts \n  \nCollapsing across the four main contrast types, the percentages of studies reporting mainly coherence increases, decreases, or neither did not differ according to frequency band (  p\u00a0  =  \u00a0  .35, Fisher's exact test). There was no consistent trend toward coherence increases or decreases in any frequency band, aside from the delta band where 80% of studies reported increased coherence during visual creativity. \n\nVisual creativity\u2010related effects on alpha coherence did not differ according to the contrast employed, for the lower or upper alpha band (  p\u00a0  =  \u00a0  .75;   p\u00a0  =  \u00a0  .86, Fisher's exact test). \n\n\n\n#### Hemispheric lateralization \n  \nNo clear pattern of laterality of power or coherence effects emerged. Most studies examining EEG power effects reported bilateral effects, but Volf et\u00a0al. ( ) found that upper alpha TRD was greater at right temporal compared to left temporal sites. In contrast, Volf and Tarasova ( ) reported greater theta TRD in the left compared to the right hemisphere. \n\nBhattacharya and Petsche ( ) reported greater task\u2010related coherence increases in the right compared to the left hemisphere for the theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands. For the measure of phase synchrony, this asymmetry was significant in artists but not novices, although an interaction of group with asymmetry was not directly assessed. Similarly, Razumnikova et\u00a0al. ( ) reported greater intrahemispheric coherence in the right hemisphere for the lower theta, lower alpha, and upper beta bands. Contrasting with these findings, however, Kozhedub et\u00a0al. ( ) reported a greater number of alpha coherence decreases versus baseline in the left compared to the right hemisphere. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Overview of functional magnetic resonance imaging findings \n  \nSignificant clusters revealed in the fMRI ALE meta\u2010analysis were in thalamus, right middle frontal, precentral, and inferior frontal gyri, left fusiform gyrus, left angular gyrus, and left cingulate gyrus. The ALE cluster in left fusiform gyrus, along with reported involvement in several studies of further bilateral occipitotemporal regions (e.g., inferior temporal gyrus, lateral occipital cortex), is consistent with predictions that visual creativity compared to control tasks is associated with greater visual processing, including visual imagery (e.g., Kosslyn & Thompson,  ). \n\nA recent meta\u2010analysis (Boccia et\u00a0al.,  ) examined fMRI activity across studies of visuospatial creativity. This analysis, however, included only three of the six fMRI studies included here (Aziz\u2010Zadeh et\u00a0al.,  ; Ellamil et\u00a0al.,  ; Huang et\u00a0al.,  ), and included foci for Kowatari et\u00a0al.'s ( ) pen design versus fixation contrast despite the lack of significant visual design versus control task differences (see Section\u00a0 ). Boccia et\u00a0al. ( ) also included a study reporting coordinates during a task involving visual perception rather than active generation of visually creative solutions (Asari et\u00a0al.,  ). Despite inclusion of additional studies (Gilbert et\u00a0al.,  ; Park et\u00a0al.,  ; Saggar et\u00a0al.,  ), and stricter inclusion criteria, both meta\u2010analyses reported similar findings. Boccia et\u00a0al. ( ) reported ALE clusters in bilateral thalamus, right middle (BA 6), and inferior (BA 9) frontal gyri that were in close proximity to regions reported in the current ALE meta\u2010analysis. The convergence between both meta\u2010analyses on similar regions of thalamus and right PFC provides additional support for the involvement of these or similar regions in visual creativity. Further supporting this, Gonen\u2010Yaacovi et\u00a0al.'s ( ) meta\u2010analysis of fMRI studies of nonverbal creativity (including both musical and visual creativity) revealed significant ALE clusters in similar, but nonoverlapping, regions of right middle and inferior frontal gyri, left cingulate, and thalamus. \n\n\n### Overview of electroencephalography findings \n  \nWhere visual creative tasks were compared against baseline fixation, the theta and lower and upper alpha frequency bands consistently showed reduced power, while higher frequency beta and gamma bands typically showed increased power relative to baseline. The theta band findings are at odds with reports that this frequency band typically shows increased power with increasing task demands (Klimesch,  ; Klimesch,  ). The studies reporting theta TRD (Razumnikova et\u00a0al.,  ; Sviderskaya,  ; Volf & Tarasova,  ) did not fully explain procedures for collecting baseline data (see Table S1; Section\u00a0 ), and so it is possible that this result is due to lengthy baseline rest periods resulting in high levels of cognitive activity and thus theta power at baseline (Fink & Benedek,  ). The findings of alpha TRD are consistent with a role of semantic and attentional processes during visual creativity (Klimesch,  ). Increased beta power is indicative of increased alertness and active concentration during visual creativity (e.g., Gola, Kami\u0144ski, Brzezicka, & Wr\u00f3bel,  ; Klimesch,  ). Such findings relative to fixation are, however, uninformative as to the neural mechanisms specific to visual creativity, as such changes may be observed in any task requiring greater cognitive resources than fixation. \n\nDespite this, relatively few EEG studies directly compared activity during visual creativity and during appropriate control tasks, and those that did revealed largely inconsistent and contradictory findings in the alpha and beta bands. A contributing factor in these inconsistencies is likely the wide variety of control tasks employed, including reading, picture viewing, and generation of essays. The small number of studies that examined such effects in the delta and theta bands showed decreased power during visual creativity compared to control tasks, and equivalent comparisons revealed increased gamma power\u2014the direction of these effects are consistent with the task versus baseline findings. Comparisons of participants of high\u2010 and low\u2010creative abilities revealed a consistent pattern of increased alpha power in the former group, although no clear pattern emerged for the remaining frequency bands. There was a tendency across studies for association of visual creativity with greater coherence in the theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands compared to visual or verbal control tasks; and in high\u2010 compared to low\u2010creativity participants. This is indicative of increased functional connectivity during visual creativity, and in individuals of higher visual creativity ability (Fingelkurts, Fingelkurts, & K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen,  ; Thatcher, Krause, & Hrybyk,  ). \n\n\n### Interpretation of findings in relation to accounts of the neural basis of creativity \n  \n#### Prefrontal cortex functions \n  \nThe proposed contribution of PFC functions to creativity has received consistent support from neuroimaging studies to date (e.g., Dietrich,  ; Dietrich & Kanso,  ; Gonen\u2010Yaacovi et\u00a0al.,  ). Accounts of creative cognition have proposed a role of PFC\u2010mediated executive functions in creative idea generation, including updating of working memory, inhibition of irrelevant ideas, monitoring, and selection of generated solutions (Dietrich,  ; Mumford et\u00a0al.,  ). Previous reviews have reported involvement of bilateral inferior PFC, DLPFC, and MFG during a variety of visual and verbal creative tasks, although the precise PFC regions engaged differ according to task\u2010specific factors (Arden, Chavez, Grazioplene, & Jung,  ; Dietrich & Kanso,  ; Gonen\u2010Yaacovi et\u00a0al.,  ). Effects relating to EEG coherence and power differences between verbal, visual, and musical creative and control tasks have often been observed to be focused on frontal sites (see Dietrich & Kanso,  ; Fink & Neubauer,  ; Jausovec & Jausovec,  ; Petsche et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nA contribution of PFC functions to visual creativity was supported in the current review. The ALE meta\u2010analysis revealed clusters in right MFG (BA 6/24) and IFG (BA 13/45), right precentral gyrus, and a left cingulate region extending into left medial PFC. The right IFG and MFG regions are consistent with recent meta\u2010analyses (Boccia et\u00a0al.,  ; Gonen\u2010Yaacovi et\u00a0al.,  ) supporting a role of these regions in nonverbal/visuospatial creativity (Section\u00a0 )\u2014overlap was in fact observed between the right precentral cluster (BA 6), which extended into IFG, and Boccia et\u00a0al.'s ( ) IFG (BA 9) cluster. The peak coordinates of the right middle frontal gyrus region (BA 6) revealed in the current meta\u2010analysis are identical to peak coordinates from Owen, McMillan, Laird, and Bullmore's ( ) meta\u2010analysis of n\u2010back working memory tasks, consistent with the proposed role of working memory, including the maintenance and manipulation of relevant information, in visual creativity (Oberauer et\u00a0al.,  ). Similar right frontal regions to those revealed here have also been implicated in the suppression of unwanted or task\u2010irrelevant memories (Anderson et\u00a0al.,  ; BA 6/13), which may engage similar mechanisms to the inhibition of irrelevant ideas in visual creativity. \n\nQualitative synthesis of all seven fMRI studies revealed PFC activity in left IFG (BA 44/45/47/11), left MFG (BA 6/9), including DLPFC (BA 46), and left SFG (BA 6/8), regions which were in close proximity to those reported in Gonen\u2010Yaacovi et\u00a0al.'s ( ) meta\u2010analysis of 34 fMRI studies showing greater activity during nonverbal versus verbal creativity (e.g., left SFG: BA 6; left DLPFC: BA 46). Left DLPFC has been repeatedly associated with monitoring, inhibition, and selection and evaluation of solutions (e.g., Herd, Banich, & O'Reilly,  ; Wagner, Maril, Bjork, & Schacter,  ), and engagement of this region in the current meta\u2010analysis is consistent with the involvement of similar processes in the generation of visual creative solutions (Basadur, Graen, & Green,  ; Mumford et\u00a0al.,  ). An evaluative role of left DLPFC is supported by Ellamil et\u00a0al.'s ( ) findings of greater activity in this region during the evaluation compared to generation phase of their book cover design task. \n\nThe reviewed EEG studies did not employ source localization, but the observation that visual creativity\u2010related coherence changes were often focused on frontal sites is again consistent with a contribution of frontal lobe functions (Dietrich,  ). Foci of alpha and beta coherence increases included frontal sites in most studies examining this outcome (Bechtereva & Nagornova,  ; Bhattacharya & Petsche,  ; Jausovec & Jausovec,  ; Sviderskaya,  ), indicative of increased functional connectivity between frontal regions and further cortical sites (Thatcher et\u00a0al.,  ). This may involve top\u2010down modulation of downstream processes including perceptual, mnemonic, or attentive processes (e.g., Gazzaley et\u00a0al.,  ). Petsche ( ) and Petsche et\u00a0al. ( ) reported reduced interhemispheric frontal alpha coherence during visual creativity, interpreting this as increased independence of left and right PFC functions. Some studies also reported that task\u2010related power increases or decreases were particularly evident at frontal sites (Jaarsveld et\u00a0al.,  ; Jausovec & Jausovec,  ). Further behavioral and neuroimaging studies including EEG studies employing source localization in addition to appropriate control tasks are necessary to establish the subregions of PFC and associated cognitive processes contributing to visual creativity. \n\n\n#### Hemispheric lateralization \n  \nMihov et\u00a0al.'s ( ) meta\u2010analysis of EEG and fMRI studies of creativity reported right hemispheric dominance in visual and verbal creativity This, however, contrasts with other reviews and meta\u2010analyses (Dietrich & Kanso,  ; Gonen\u2010Yaacovi et\u00a0al.,  ; Wu et\u00a0al.,  ) which reported no evidence of lateralization of creativity. Here, the ALE meta\u2010analysis of fMRI studies revealed activity in a number of bilateral PFC, inferior temporal, parietal, and subcortical regions. The PFC regions were primarily in the right hemisphere, with only the left cingulate cluster encompassing parts of left medial PFC. This contrasts with the qualitative findings, where more studies reported left (6/7) compared to right PFC (3/7) engagement. Together, these findings are indicative of greater consistency across studies and across tasks in the right PFC regions contributing to visual creativity, whereas left PFC regions, while commonly engaged, appear to vary according to task\u2010specific factors. \n\nThe apparent contribution of right PFC is consistent with Goel's ( ) Frontal Lobe Lateralization Hypothesis, which proposes that the right PFC, particularly DLPFC, supports ill\u2010structured representations that facilitate the open\u2010ended problem solving which is involved in visual design. Further studies directly assessing effects of hemisphere are, however, necessary to test the notion that right PFC regions (MFG, IFG) contribute to a greater extent to visual creativity than the corresponding left hemisphere regions. Two reviewed fMRI studies attempted comparison of effects in corresponding left and right PFC regions (Huang et\u00a0al.,  ; Kowatari et\u00a0al.,  ), but as they did not examine Hemisphere\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Task/Group interactions, they fall short of providing direct evidence of lateralization (Section\u00a0 ). \n\nOf the 20 reviewed EEG experiments, only a minority reported effects of hemisphere (Section\u00a0 ). Bhattacharya and Petsche ( ) observed greater task\u2010related coherence increases in the theta, alpha, and beta bands in the right compared to the left hemisphere, but Kozhedub et\u00a0al. ( ) in contrast reported greater probability of task\u2010related changes in alpha coherence in the left compared to right hemisphere. In the majority of EEG studies, visual creativity\u2010related effects on power and coherence were largely bilateral, with no evidence of hemispheric dominance. No evidence was revealed of the alpha power asymmetry effects that have been associated with positive versus negative affect (Davidson,  ) or response inhibition (Wacker, Chavanon, Leue, & Stemmler,  ). In addition, the above studies reporting hemispheric effects did not assess whether these effects remained when comparing visual creativity to matched control tasks, and so it is unclear whether such effects are specific to visual creativity. \n\nTaken together, the findings of the current review do not provide support for theories of hemispheric lateralization of visual creativity. \n\n\n#### Role of semantic and episodic memory processes \n  \nA number of the left\u2010lateralized regions identified in visual creativity contrasts in the reviewed fMRI studies have been implicated in semantic retrieval. A meta\u2010analysis of 120 functional neuroimaging studies (Binder, Desai, Graves, & Conant,  ) found left MFG, SFG, and IFG and left inferior parietal lobe to be involved in semantic processing, regions which showed greater activity during visual creativity compared to control tasks in several of the reviewed fMRI studies (Aziz\u2010Zadeh et\u00a0al.,  ; Ellamil et\u00a0al.,  ; Huang et\u00a0al.,  ; Park et\u00a0al.,  ; Saggar et\u00a0al.,  ). Left IFG, particularly pars orbitalis, has been consistently associated with semantic processing and retrieval (Binder et\u00a0al.,  ; Liakakis, Nickel, & Seitz,  ), and supports controlled access to conceptual representations (Badre, Poldrack, Par\u00e9\u2010Blagoev, Insler, & Wagner,  ). This region showed greater activity during visual creativity compared to control tasks in several studies (Aziz\u2010Zadeh et\u00a0al.,  ; Ellamil et\u00a0al.,  ; Huang et\u00a0al.,  ; Saggar et\u00a0al.,  ), but was not identified in the ALE meta\u2010analysis. Activity during visual creativity in regions which have been linked to semantic processing does not directly support a role of the latter in visual creativity (Poldrack,  ), but such a role is consistent with proposals that semantic retrieval and association are core components of creative ideation (Abraham & Bubic,  ; Beaty et\u00a0al.,  ; Mednick,  ; Mumford et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nDecreased EEG alpha power over frontal sites, particularly in the upper alpha band (~10\u201314\u00a0Hz) has been linked to semantic processing (Doppelmayr, Klimesch, Stadler, P\u00f6llhuber, & Heine,  ; Klimesch,  ; Klimesch, Sauseng, & Hanslmayr,  ; Klimesch, Schimke, & Pfurtscheller,  ). Consistent with a role of semantic memory in visual creativity, widespread upper alpha power reductions which included frontal regions were observed in several studies compared to baseline (e.g., Molle et\u00a0al.,  ; Nagornova,  ; Petsche et\u00a0al.,  ) and/or compared to control task performance (Jaarsveld et\u00a0al.,  ; Jausovec & Jausovec,  ). Upper alpha reductions were prominent over frontal sites in the latter two studies. For the critical contrast of visual creativity versus control tasks, however, this pattern was far from consistent across studies. \n\nEpisodic memory, memory for personally experienced events bound with context (Tulving,  ), is thought to facilitate generation of creative ideas through a constructive process involving elements of previously experienced events (Benedek et\u00a0al.,  ; Runco & Chand,  ). Consistent with this, two of the reviewed fMRI studies of visual creative ideation (Ellamil et\u00a0al.,  ; Park et\u00a0al.,  ), in addition to studies of verbal creative ideation (e.g., Fink et\u00a0al.,  ) reported greater activity during creative tasks in the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, regions strongly associated with mnemonic processing (e.g., Dickerson & Eichenbaum,  ). The mediodorsal thalamic nucleus region revealed in the fMRI meta\u2010analysis has also been linked to recollection and familiarity in episodic memory (Zola\u2010Morgan & Squire,  ; Zoppelt, Koch, Schwarz, & Daum,  ), and is thought to relay inputs to and from hippocampal and prefrontal memory processing regions (Markowitsch,  ; Xu & Sudhof,  ). \n\n\n#### Visual imagery and visual processing \n  \nALE meta\u2010analysis revealed activity for the contrast of visual creativity versus control tasks in the left fusiform gyrus. The majority (5/7) of the reviewed fMRI studies reported greater activity during visual creativity compared to control tasks in this and further occipitotemporal regions, including lateral and middle occipital cortex and middle and inferior temporal gyri (Aziz\u2010Zadeh et\u00a0al.,  ; Ellamil et\u00a0al.,  ; Huang et\u00a0al.,  ; Park et\u00a0al.,  ; Saggar et\u00a0al.,  ). These findings are consistent with a greater role of processing of visual information during visual creativity. As the idea generation phase of each fMRI study involved visual input, whether verbal instructions (Gilbert et\u00a0al.,  ; Saggar et\u00a0al.,  ), images/image fragments (Aziz\u2010Zadeh et\u00a0al.,  ; Huang et\u00a0al.,  ; Kowatari et\u00a0al.,  ), or sketches drawn by the participant (Ellamil et\u00a0al.,  ), this activity may simply reflect perceptual and conceptual processing of visual input (Cowell, Bussey, & Saksida,  ; Tyler et\u00a0al.,  ). However, a further, not mutually exclusive possibility is that greater visual cortical activation is associated with greater engagement of visual imagery processes. Visual imagery engages many of the same or highly similar regions of occipitotemporal cortex as visual perception, including bilateral inferior and middle temporal gyri and middle occipital cortex (Ganis, Thompson, & Kosslyn,  ; Ishai, Haxby, & Ungerleider,  ), regions that were identified in several of the reviewed fMRI studies. \n\nThe left fusiform gyrus region revealed in the meta\u2010analysis has been repeatedly linked to visual imagery (Ganis et\u00a0al.,  ; Kosslyn & Thompson,  ). Consistent with suggestions that visual creativity, in particular visual design, engages manipulation of visual imagery, fMRI meta\u2010analyses have found overlapping left fusiform gyrus regions to be engaged in mental rotation (Tomasino & Gremese,  ; Zacks,  ). An overlapping region has also been implicated in retrieval of the semantic representations required to support visual imagery (Kan et\u00a0al.,  ). The left lateralization of the observed fusiform activity is consistent with studies reporting that visual imagery predominantly engages the left hemisphere (D'Esposito et\u00a0al.,  ; Sack, Camprodon, Pascual\u2010Leone, & Goebel,  ), but as none of the reviewed studies formally compared effects in corresponding regions of left and right hemispheres, this account is not directly supported. \n\nSeveral of the reviewed EEG studies reported that visual creativity\u2010related effects on power were larger or more significant over occipital compared to more anterior electrode sites, again consistent with a role of visual processing (e.g., Molle et\u00a0al.,  ; Sviderskaya,  ; Sviderskaya et\u00a0al.,  ; Volf et\u00a0al.,  ). Previous findings of reduced EEG power over occipitoparietal sites during visual imagery (Marks & Isaac,  ; Salenius, Kajola, Thompson, Kosslyn, & Hari,  ) were echoed by Jausovec and Jausovec ( ) who observed reduced lower and upper alpha power over occipital and left frontal sites only. \n\nTask\u2010related coherence changes were often manifested by long\u2010range delta, alpha, and beta intrahemispheric coherence increases between frontal and posterior occipital sites, indicative of increased functional connectivity between these regions during visual creativity (Petsche,  ; Sviderskaya,  ; Volf et\u00a0al.,  ). The apparent increases in frontal\u2013posterior connectivity may reflect top\u2010down modulation of generation and manipulation of mental visual images (Mechelli, Price, Friston, & Ishai,  ). \n\n\n#### Alpha frequency \n  \nReduced task\u2010related alpha power (TRD) is thought to reflect increased cortical activation. Alpha suppression over frontal sites, particularly in the upper alpha band (~10\u201314\u00a0Hz) (Doppelmayr et\u00a0al.,  ; Klimesch,  ), has been associated with semantic processing (Klimesch et\u00a0al.,  ,  ), while lower alpha TRD has been associated with attentional processes (Klimesch et\u00a0al.,  ; Section\u00a0 ). Despite earlier conceptions of increased alpha power as \u201ccortical idling\u201d (Pfurtscheller, Stancak, & Neuper,  ), it is now widely believed that alpha task\u2010related synchronization (TRS) reflects active processes including inhibition of task\u2010irrelevant processes, or internal processing demands (Fink & Benedek,  ; Klimesch,  ,  ; Klimesch et\u00a0al.,  ). This inhibitory control may contribute to creative task performance (e.g., Fink & Benedek,  ; Grabner et\u00a0al.,  ; Klimesch, Doppelmayr, & Hanslmayr,  ; Sauseng et\u00a0al.,  ). During both visual and verbal divergent thinking tasks, both increased (e.g., Fink, Grabner, Benedek, & Neubauer,  ; Nagornova,  ) and decreased (Jausovec & Jausovec,  ; Razumnikova et\u00a0al.,  ) alpha power has been reported. Dietrich and Kanso's ( ) systematic review of neuroimaging studies of creativity reported no clear pattern of alpha increases or decreases, either across verbal and visual divergent thinking studies, or across artistic and musical creativity studies. This echoes the current review, where in the few cases where EEG power during visual creativity tasks was directly compared with non\u2010rest control tasks, no clear pattern of increases or decreases in alpha power emerged. This suggests that depending on specific task demands or strategies, both semantic and attentional processing (TRD) and inhibitory processes (TRS) may be involved in visual creativity. \n\nWhen visual creative tasks were compared to baseline fixation, a consistent pattern of lower and upper alpha power decreases was observed. This is consistent with greater cortical activation, and greater semantic and attentional processing during visual creativity versus fixation (e.g., Klimesch,  ). Power changes versus baseline, however, provide a limited contribution to understanding of the neural basis of visual creativity, as they do not inform as to whether this response is specific to visual creativity (Arden et\u00a0al.,  )\u2014similar patterns may emerge in response to any number of other tasks that are more cognitively demanding than fixation. Reduced alpha power compared to baseline has, for example, been elicited during working memory (Stipacek, Grabner, Neuper, Fink, & Neubauer,  ), recognition (Dujardin et\u00a0al.,  ), and visual classification (Pfurtscheller & Klimesch,  ). Such findings along with early reports of reduced alpha power simply when eyes are open compared to closed (e.g., Klimesch,  ) have consolidated the view that alpha suppression reflects cortical activation. Fink and colleagues have, however, consistently observed alpha power increases during verbal creative ideation (e.g., Fink & Neubauer,  ; Fink et\u00a0al.,  ), and a selective review by Fink and Benedek ( ) reported overall support for a role of alpha TRS in creative ideation. The majority of the evidence reported by Fink and Benedek ( ), however, also referred to studies of verbal ideation, and so these contradictory findings could be reconciled if inhibitory processes, manifested by alpha TRS, are more often engaged during verbal compared to visual creativity, the latter involving greater semantic and attentional processing. \n\nThree of the four studies comparing alpha power in participants of high and low creativity reported increased lower and upper power in the former group. However, due to the small number of studies and as these increases reflected both reduced TRD (Petsche et\u00a0al.,  ) and increased absolute power (without reference to baseline; Jausovec,  ; Sviderskaya et\u00a0al.,  ), it is difficult to arrive at a clear interpretation of this finding in relation to accounts of the role of alpha TRS/TRD. Furthermore, as some studies divided participants into high\u2010 and low\u2010performance groups via a median split based on originality of generated solutions, high\u2010 and low\u2010creativity groups may not have demonstrated comparable creative ability across studies. \n\nA further caveat is that few studies directly compared visual creative tasks with non\u2010rest control tasks, and of those that did, findings were inconsistent for alpha power and coherence. To form clearer conclusions on the contributions of alpha oscillations to visual creativity, a greater number of quality studies (see Sections\u00a0  and  ) employing comparable contrasts, tasks and measures are necessary. \n\n\n\n### Methodological issues in reviewed studies \n  \nThe qualitative synthesis of EEG studies revealed relatively few consistent findings, and despite several significant clusters emerging in the ALE meta\u2010analysis, findings of the fMRI studies also differed substantially. This lack of consistency may stem from substantial heterogeneity in the visual creative and control tasks, contrasts conducted, and outcome measures recorded (see Amabile,  ). Even where the same creative task was employed, for example, TTCT\u2010IF, it was compared against a variety of control tasks, ranging from simple line tracing to more cognitively demanding visual and verbal problem\u2010solving and memory tasks. Evidence of a common neural or electrophysiological basis of visual creativity may be obscured by comparisons against tasks eliciting widely differing cognitive processes (Arden et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nTasks also differed in their focus, with visual design tasks highlighting the functionality of generated solutions (e.g., Ellamil et\u00a0al.,  ; Gilbert et\u00a0al.,  ; Kowatari et\u00a0al.,  ); artistic tasks emphasizing esthetics (e.g., Bhattacharya & Petsche,  ; Petsche,  ); and others emphasizing the originality or fluency of solutions (e.g., Kozhedub et\u00a0al.,  ; Volf et\u00a0al.,  ). Greater consistencies in the neural or electrophysiological correlates of visual creativity may be detectable by subdividing studies according to these goal\u2010related factors, that is, tasks requiring generation of solutions that are (1) functional, (2) esthetically pleasing, or (3) original. However, heterogeneity in procedures, populations studied, contrasts conducted, and outcome measures recorded meant that such subdivisions were unfeasible here due to low numbers of comparable studies within each category. \n\nA further key issue is that of the timing and duration of sampling of neural activity associated with visual creativity. Most reviewed studies recorded and averaged neural activity across the duration of the visual creativity task, but in a subset of studies (e.g., Aziz\u2010Zadeh et\u00a0al.,  ; Gilbert et\u00a0al.,  ; Jaarsveld et\u00a0al.,  ) participants were asked to signal when the task was complete, and activity was averaged from the start of the task until the response. Both methods are likely to capture the cognitive and neural processes involved in visual creative ideation, and likely also idea evaluation, but due to the long sampling periods (typically ~30\u00a0s) are likely also to include further cognitive processes both related and unrelated to visual creativity, for example, comprehension of task instructions, maintenance of visual representations, default mode activity (Fink, Benedek, Grabner, Staudt, & Neubauer,  ; Fox & Raichle,  ), potentially reducing the signal to noise ratio, and ability to detect processes specific to visual creativity (Abraham,  ). \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nQuality assessment of the reviewed studies (Section\u00a0 , Table S1) revealed that most did not meet all quality criteria. Many did not provide complete descriptions of participant selection and demographic information (41%), task procedure (33%), neuroimaging procedure and outcome measures (7%), and analyses and results (15%). This not only precludes replication, but also leads to difficulties in directly comparing findings across studies (Whiting et\u00a0al.,  ). A further critical issue is that 37% of the 27 experiments did not conduct appropriate multiple comparisons corrections, or in the case of EEG studies, correction for violation of sphericity, limiting the reliability of reported findings. \n\nLack of controls in 48% of experiments of factors such as task difficulty or duration between experimental and control tasks (e.g., Jausovec,  ; Nagornova,  ) introduced further potential confounds. In 60% of EEG studies, visual creativity was simply compared against baseline fixation/rest and not a matched non\u2010rest control task, leading to the inability to infer whether effects are specific to visual creativity or are observed during multiple cognitive processes. Another difficulty in synthesizing results across EEG studies stemmed from differences in outcome measures\u2014several reported differences in raw measures of power, while others reported task\u2010related power corrected for baseline power. \n\n\n### Future directions \n  \nTo more clearly establish the neural basis of visual creativity, it is necessary to address the above methodological issues and ensure the quality criteria outlined in Section\u00a0  are met. It is important to introduce measures to ensure control of confounds between visual creative and control tasks (Abraham,  ). Greater standardization of the control tasks employed or use of several control tasks within the same sample will better enable identification of commonalities in neural activity between studies and between visual creative tasks. In fMRI studies, examination of functional overlap between regions identified in contrasts of visual creativity against multiple appropriate control tasks would enable identification of regions that are reliably engaged in, and are specific to, visual creativity. \n\nIt is also important to acknowledge that visual creativity is a composite, nonunitary construct and likely consists of multiple distinct cognitive and neural processes (Dietrich & Kanso,  )\u2014a common neural basis may not be readily detectable. The mechanisms underlying visual creativity may differ according to task\u2010specific features such as focus on (1) functionality, (2) originality and/or fluency, and (3) esthetics of produced visual solutions. Most studies, particularly EEG studies, have thus far employed tasks emphasizing originality or fluency, and there remain insufficient comparable studies (in terms of procedures and outcome measures) within each proposed type of visual creative task for reliable comparisons across studies. As a result, quantitative and qualitative syntheses collapsed across these task divisions in the current review. The meta\u2010analysis findings, which incorporated studies employing tasks focusing on the functionality and originality/fluency of solutions, in addition to one study with no clear task focus, however, offer promising evidence that certain regions, including fusiform gyrus, thalamus, and right PFC, contribute to visual creativity across multiple task foci. \n\nAn aim of this review was to assess evidence for a consistent neural/electrophysiological basis of creativity when focusing on the visual domain only, and only on active generation of visual creative forms. It was hoped that this would lead to greater clarity of interpretation and consistency of findings compared to previous reviews which have sought a common neural basis across multiple domains of creativity (visual, musical, verbal) and across insight problem solving, perception/memory of existing creative forms in addition to their active generation (e.g., Dietrich & Kanso,  ; Gonen\u2010Yaacovi et\u00a0al.,  ). However, it is important to consider how findings in the visual domain relate to those from and across other domains of creativity by assessing the extent to which creative tasks exhibit shared variance in terms of cognitive and neural contributions. \n\nThe current meta\u2010analysis revealed little evidence of overlap in the cortical regions engaged compared to Boccia et\u00a0al.'s ( ) meta\u2010analyses of musical and verbal creativity, aside from an overlapping region of left medial frontal gyrus (BA32) here and in the musical creativity meta\u2010analysis. This may be due to lack of power in the current meta\u2010analysis due to small numbers of studies, but also reinforces Boccia et\u00a0al.'s ( ) findings of domain\u2010specific as well as domain\u2010general cortical contributions to creativity. However, to directly contrast visual creativity with other forms of creative ideation it will be necessary for future studies to directly compare visual and nonvisual creativity within the same participants. A small number of the reviewed EEG studies reported power and/or coherence effects versus baseline of similar magnitude and in the same direction for both visual and verbal divergent thinking (Jausovec & Jausovec,  ; Molle et al.,  ; Razumnikova et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). However, as these findings refer to baseline contrasts, comparable effects may be observed with any number of tasks requiring cognitive effort (Section\u00a0 ). \n\nConsistent with Arden et\u00a0al.'s ( ) suggested psychometric approach to creativity, given suggestions that visual creativity relies on semantic, executive, and visual imagery processes, these claims could be evaluated by assessing whether ability in these cognitive domains predicts visual creative ability, or neural activity elicited during visual creativity. Such associations could be compared across multiple domains of creativity and across task foci. \n\nMachine learning algorithms (see Brouwer, Zander, van Erp, Korteling, & Bronkhorsst,  ; Mwangi, Tian, & Soares,  , for reviews) offer promising avenues in identification and classification of EEG and fMRI features associated with visual creativity compared to control tasks, or in classification of features associated with visual creativity emphasizing functionality, esthetics, and originality. In fMRI, multivariate pattern recognition algorithms may aid in identifying not only which cortical regions show involvement in visual creativity, but also which regions show evidence of representing visually generated creative ideas, and which regions differentiate between the generation of functional, esthetic, and original visual solutions (Mur, Bandettini, & Kriegeskorte,  ). \n\nThe inherent difficulty in temporal isolation of the processes directly relevant to creativity has been noted (Abraham,  ), leading Fink et\u00a0al. ( ) to suggest a method via which participants indicate the moment of idea generation, and the activity immediately preceding the button press is examined. The issue of selection of an arbitrary sampling duration is not fully avoided using this method, but in future studies, adoption of a common method of isolating activity associated with creative ideation will aid comparability of findings across studies. \n\nThese suggestions for future research are summarized below: \n\n  \nEnsure greater between\u2010study consistency in the nature of creative and control tasks employed, and adequate control of confounds between creative and control tasks. \n  \nDirectly examine effects of task focus (e.g., function, esthetics, originality) on the neural basis of visual creativity. \n  \nDirectly contrast and compare the neural and cognitive basis of visual compared to verbal and musical creativity (Arden et\u00a0al.,  ). \n  \nCapitalize on advancements in machine learning and multivariate pattern analysis techniques to identify features associated with representation of visual creative ideas. \n  \nEmploy standard methods across studies of isolating the time period to be examined, for example, following Fink et\u00a0al.'s ( ) approach of examining neural activity directly preceding pressing of an \u201cidea button.\u201d \n  \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nMeta\u2010analysis of six fMRI studies revealed, across studies, greater activity in regions of right middle and inferior frontal gyri during visual creativity compared to non\u2010rest control tasks, and EEG power and coherence effects during visual creativity were often focused on frontal sites. These findings are consistent with theories of creative cognition that propose an integral role of PFC functions including working memory, inhibition of task\u2010irrelevant information, selection among competing representations, and monitoring and evaluation of solutions. Meta\u2010analysis of fMRI studies and qualitative synthesis of fMRI and EEG studies also supported a role of occipitotemporal regions in visual creative task performance, consistent with a role of increased visual processing, including visual imagery and visual image manipulation, during visual creativity. Neither fMRI nor EEG studies provided clear support for the notion of right hemispheric dominance in visual creativity, although the meta\u2010analysis findings demonstrated greater cross\u2010study consistency in the right compared to left PFC regions engaged. Synthesis of the EEG studies did not provide consistent support for suggestions that either increases or decreases in alpha power contribute to visual creativity. \n\n\n## Funding information \n  \nThis study was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (Grant/Award Number: EP/M012123/1 and EP/M01214X/1). \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5064346, "text_md5": "d7739a204872d70aee35784dd87a0187", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 154], "journal": [155, 166], "publication_year": [168, 172], "title": [183, 266], "keywords": [280, 450], "abstract": [463, 1719], "body": [1728, 82984]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 27781148, "doi": "10.1002/brb3.540", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5064346", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5064346"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5064346\">5064346</a>", "list_title": "PMC5064346  Functional neuroimaging of visual creativity: a systematic review and meta\u2010analysis"}
