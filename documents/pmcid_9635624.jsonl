Recently, the term \u201cproblematic smartphone use\u201d (or also called \u201cproblematic mobile phone use\u201d by some researchers) has been introduced, which is defined as excessive use of smartphones with features of craving, dependence, loss of control, and potentially related physical and mental health problems ( ;  ;  ). These problems include, for instance, bodily pain ( ), poor sleep quality ( ), reduced physical fitness ( ), as well as mental problems such as depressive symptoms ( ;  ) and even major depressive disorder ( ). \n\nIdentifying factors associated with problematic smartphone use can help identify at-risk population and guide targeted interventions for further research ( ;  ). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers a promising approach for characterizing the intrinsic brain functional organizations ( ;  ). Using rs-fMRI, a growing body of neuroimaging studies has suggested that problematic smartphone use is associated with brain dysfunction even in non-clinical samples with no diagnosis of psychiatric disorders ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). For example, the severity of problematic smartphone use has been reported to be positively associated with functional connectivity between the parahippocampal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus ( ), and negatively associated with the fronto-limbic functional connectivity ( ) in general populations. In another study, problematic smartphone use was suggested to be related to enhanced functional connectivity within the salience network, as well as between the salience and default-mode networks ( ). Importantly, some of these alterations (e.g., parahippocampal gyrus-middle temporal gyrus functional connectivity) have been found to moderate the relationship between problematic smartphone use and depressive symptoms in adolescents ( ). Appreciably, these findings have advanced our understanding of the potential neurobiological factors associated with problematic smartphone use, which may guide further research on interventions for this problem. \n\nThe currently published rs-fMRI studies on problematic smartphone use, however, are limited in several ways. Firstly, most of these studies were focused on connectivity patterns within predefined regions of interest (ROIs). Although there have been some attempts ( ), investigations on how problematic smartphone use would affect the large-scale configurations of brain networks are relatively limited. Especially, it has been suggested that graph-theoretical-based features of the whole-brain network (e.g., global and local efficiency) can provide a powerful and reliable framework for understanding the alterations in brain function ( ;  ;  ), but their possible relationships with problematic smartphone use were seldom reported. Secondly and importantly, while conventional rs-fMRI studies were generally performed under the assumption that connectivity patterns between brain areas are static, recent studies have proved that the brain connectivity patterns are actually dynamically changed over time ( , ). The \u201cdynamic functional connectivity (dFC)\u201d was suggested to reflect important information ignored by conventional \u201cstatic functional connectivity (sFC)\u201d ( ;  ), and has been widely used in recent rs-fMRI studies in both psychiatric ( ;  ) and non-clinical ( ;  ) populations. Nonetheless, whether problematic smartphone use would affect the brain dFC patterns have been barely investigated to our knowledge, and needs further investigation. \n\nTo overcome the above limitations, this study aimed to investigate the possible associations between problematic smartphone use and differences in large-scale brain network organizations by combining both sFC and dFC analyzing methods. We anticipate that the results would provide meaningful information to previous studies focusing on only specific ROIs and/or on only brain sFC patterns, and further improve our understanding of the possible biological factors associated with problematic smartphone use. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants and measures \n  \nFifty-three young healthy adults were recruited from the Changsha city area, Hunan Province, China based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) 18\u223c25 years of age; (2) native Chinese speakers; (3) right-handed; (4) were never diagnosed with any psychiatric diseases; and (5) had no contraindications to rs-fMRI scanning. All participants had signed informed consent, and the study was proved by the Ethics Committee of Second Xiangya Hospital, Changsha, China. \n\nThe participants were asked to complete the Short Version of the Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS-SV) ( ) to assess the problematic smartphone use severity. The SAS-SV was a self-reported scale that contains 10 items, each rated from 1 (\u201cstrongly disagree\u201d) to 6 (\u201cstrongly agree\u201d). Thus, the total score of SAS-SV ranges from 10 to 60, and a higher score indicates a higher level of current problematic smartphone use ( ;  ). The Chinese version of SAS-SV has been proved to be valid ( ) and was widely applied in Chinese adults ( ;  ,  ;  ). \n\nAll participants also completed the following scales to estimate their current mental health situations during the past two weeks: (1) the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), a screening instrument for depressive symptoms ( ;  ); and (2) the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), a questionnaire to assess anxiety levels ( ;  ). The Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 coefficients of the SAS-SV, PHQ-9, and GAD-7 in this study were 0.869, 0.831, and 0.867 respectively, which suggests a good internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 coefficient > 0.7) ( ). \n\n\n### Imaging data acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nThe rs-fMRI data were acquired from each participant using a 3.0 T Siemens scanner with the following key parameters: matrix = 64 \u00d7 64, slices = 32, repetition time (TR) = 2,000 ms, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, slice thickness = 5 mm, gap = 0 mm, flip angle = 90\u00b0, field of view (FOV) = 240 \u00d7 240 mm , and total volumes = 216. T1-weighted images were also acquired for registration with the following key parameters: matrix = 256 \u00d7 256, slices = 176, TR = 1,900 ms, TE = 2 ms, slice thickness = 1 mm, gap = 0 mm, and FOV = 256 \u00d7 256 mm . After data acquisition, the images of all participants were preprocessed using the DPARSF software  ( ;  ) with the standard pipeline. Briefly, the pipeline includes removing the first 10 time points, slice timing, motion realignment, spatial normalization, temporal filtering (0.01\u20130.10 Hz), and nuisance regression (including the white matter and cerebrospinal fluid signals) ( ;  ). The following procedures were performed to ensure data quality: (1) all preprocessed images were manually checked by trained researchers to rule out overt artifacts or poor registration; (2) data were excluded from the analyses when excessive head motion occurred during scanning, as defined by mean framewise-displacement (FD) > 0.2 mm ( ); (3) the mean FD values were further used as a controlling variable in all the following analyses. More details about the data acquisition parameters and preprocessing steps can be found in a previously published work ( ). \n\n\n### Static and dynamic brain network constructions \n  \nThe Power functional atlas ( ), which includes a total of 264 ROIs distributed across the brain (see  ), was used to define the nodes in brain networks for each participant. We chose the Power atlas here since it was widely used and validated in both sFC and dFC studies ( ;  ;  ). The mean time series were firstly extracted from each of the 264 nodes (ROIs) by averaging rs-fMRI signals within each node. The sFC strength for any pair of two nodes was computed as the Fisher\u2019s r-to-z transformed Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients of the extracted time series, yielding a 264*264 sFC matrix which represents the static brain network organization ( ). \n  \n (A)   The regions of interests (ROIs) used to define the brain nodes and their subnetwork assignments.   (B)   A summary of procedures for static functional connectivity (sFC) and dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analyses (see details in the Methods section). ATT, attention subnetwork; AUD, auditory subnetwork; CON, cinguloopercular subnetwork; DMN, default-mode subnetwork; FPN, frontoparietal subnetwork; NaN, unassigned; SAL, salience subnetwork; SM, sensorimotor subnetwork; SUB, subcortical subnetwork; VIS, visual subnetwork. \n  \nTo construct dynamic brain networks, the extracted time series were further segmented into a number of continuous time windows using a common sliding-window approach ( ;  ). A window width of 50 TRs (100 s) and a step length of 3 TRs (6 s) were used based on previous recommendations ( ;  ;  ), resulting in a total of 53 time windows. Similar to the sFC matrixes, a 264*264 dFC matrix was then generated for each time window based on the Fisher\u2019s r-to-z transformed connection strengths between nodes. These dFC matrices are time-ordered, and thus formed a dynamic brain network   G   = (  G  ) , in which the   t  th matrix (  G  ) represents the \u201csnapshot\u201d of brain dFC patterns within the   t  th time window ( ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Global and nodal brain network metrics \n  \nSeveral common global and nodal network metrics were calculated for both the static and dynamic (weighted, undirected) brain networks for each participant. Static network metrics included the global efficiency (  E  ) and local efficiency (  E  ) at the global level, as well as the nodal degree of each node. The   E   and   E   are two of the most intuitive and widely-used metrics to measure the information transfer efficiency of a static brain network ( ;  ;  ). The nodal degree is a basic measure of the overall connectivity of a node to the rest of the brain ( ;  ). The   E   and   E   were calculated in a range of density levels from 0.10 to 0.34 with an interval of 0.01, to avoid possible bias caused by a single density level ( ;  ;  ). This range was chosen because it guaranteed that the network metrics were estimable and there were not too many spurious edges ( ;  ). For each metric, the area under the curve (AUC) across such a density range (0.10\u20130.34) was calculated and fed into statistical analyses ( ;  ). Referring to the previous work, the characteristic path length (  L  ) and clustering coefficient (  C  ) were also calculated for the latter validation analyses ( ). The above static brain network metrics were calculated using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox ( ). \n\nThe examined dynamic network metrics included the   temporal variability   for the entire brain network and   nodal temporal variability   of each node ( ;  ;  ;  ). These two metrics quantify the temporal stability of brain dFC patterns at the global and nodal levels, respectively; higher values of temporal variability indicate more fluctuations of the dFC patterns (less stable dFCs) over time. More details about the calculations of these two metrics can be found in previous publications ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Large-scale subnetwork analyses \n  \nBesides the global and nodal network metrics, large-scale subnetwork analyses were also performed on both the sFC and dFC architectures strictly following the procedures in previous publications ( ;  ;  ;  ). According to prior work ( ;  ;  ,  ), all ROIs in the Power atlas were firstly assigned into nine large-scale subnetworks including the default-mode, salience, visual, subcortical, auditory, frontoparietal, cinguloopercular, sensorimotor and attention subnetworks ( ). The strengths of within-and between-subnetwork sFC were calculated by averaging the z-transformed sFC values across all involved connections within a specific subnetwork, or between a specific pair of subnetworks ( ). Similarly, the temporal variabilities of within- and between-subnetwork dFC were also obtained by calculating the average variabilities of dFC across all involved connections ( ;  ;  ). This resulted in nine within-subnetwork sFC/dFC measures and 36 between-subnetwork sFC/dFC measures. \n\n\n### Statistics \n  \nThe possible associations between problematic smartphone use and all the sFC/dFC measures were investigated from two perspectives. Firstly, relationships between all brain network measures and the SAS-SV score were assessed using the partial Pearson correlations adjusted for age, sex, years of education, and head motion (mean FD value). False discovery rate (FDR) corrections were applied to correct for multiple correlation tests (e.g., across the three global metrics, the 264 nodes, the nine within-subnetwork and 36 between-subnetwork measures). Significance was set at FDR-corrected   p   < 0.05. The results were visualized partly using the BrainNet Viewer ( ). \n\nSecondly, all brain network measures were compared between the groups of participants with and without a problematic smartphone use, as defined by the commonly-used SAS-SV cutoff points proposed in prior research (SAS-SV scores \u2265 31 for males and \u2265 33 for females) ( ;  ;  ;  ). All brain network measures were compared between the two groups using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) covarying for age, sex, years of education, and head motion. Similarly, FDR corrections were applied to correct for multiple comparisons, and significance was set at FDR-corrected   p   < 0.05. \n\n\n### Validation analyses \n  \nSeveral follow-up analyses were performed to validate the results. Firstly, the associations between the SAS-SV score and   L  /  C  , which have equivalent meanings to the   E   and   E   ( ), were estimated using the same methods. Secondly, since the optimal window width and step length for the sliding-windows method are still being debated ( ;  ), the analyses on all dFC measures were repeatedly with a set of different window and step lengths for the sliding windows [window/step = (80, 100, 120)/(4, 6, 8) s] to see if the results were affected by such analyzing strategies. \n\n\n### Exploratory analyses \n  \nIn the present study, we performed two-step exploratory analyses to see if those problematic smartphone use-related differences in sFC/dFC would have mediation effects in the relationship between problematic smartphone use and psychological symptoms. Firstly, the linear regression analyses (controlling for age, sex, and education) were used to determine whether an association existed between the SAS-SV score and the GAD-7/PHQ-9 score. Secondly, when significant associations existed (  p   < 0.05), the analyses of mediation effects were further conducted using the PROCESS software ( ) on the sFC/dFC measures. Model 4 in the PROCESS software was used with 5,000 bootstrapping resamples; a significant mediation occurred when the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the indirect effect did not include zero ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n  \nA summary of how to test the mediation effects of brain network measures in the relationship between problematic smartphone use severity and psychological symptoms. A significant mediation occurred when the 95% confidence interval for the indirect effect did not include zero. \n  \nAdditionally, since no significant results were found in group comparisons between the participants with and without a problematic smartphone use (see later in Section \u201cGroup comparisons\u201d) based on the SAS-SV cutoff points proposed in prior research (\u2265 31 for males and \u2265 33 for females), we explored whether the results would change when using a different cutoff. Here, referring to some published studies ( ;  ;  ), we used a cutoff score estimated based on one standard deviation above the mean of SAS-SV score in the surveyed sample; this resulted a new cutoff score of \u2265 43 for males and \u2265 42 for females. Group comparisons were repeated based on such new cutoff. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Sample characteristics \n  \nDuring data preprocessing, two participants were excluded because of excessive head motion. Thus, the final analyzed sample consisted of 51 subjects and their demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in  . \n  \nCharacteristics of the final analyzed sample (  n   = 51). \n  \n\n### Correlation analyses \n  \nAt the global level, significant correlations were found between the SAS-SV score and the   E   of static brain networks (  r   = 0.288, corrected   p   = 0.049), as well as between the SAS-SV score and the   E   of static brain networks (  r   = 0.335, corrected   p   = 0.032) ( ). Furthermore, a significant negative correlation was found between the SAS-SV score and the temporal variability of dynamic brain networks (  r   = \u22120.354, corrected   p   = 0.032) ( ). At the nodal level, however, no significant correlations were found for any metric (all corrected   p   > 0.05). \n  \nResults of the partial correlations between the short version of the smartphone addiction scale (SAS-SC) score and each global brain network metric.

No significant results were found on the between-subnetwork sFC/dFC measures (all corrected-  p   > 0.05). \n  \nResults of partial correlations between the short version of the smartphone addiction scale (SAS-SC) score and the within-or between-subnetwork static functional connectivity (sFC) strength   (A)   and dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) temporal variability   (B)  .

However, no significant group differences were found on any brain network measure between the participants with and without a problematic smartphone use (all corrected   p   > 0.05), even for those measures showing significant correlations with the SAS-SV score ( ). \n  \n (A)   Results of group comparisons when defining problematic smartphone use with the cutoff proposed in prior research [short version of the smartphone addiction scale (SAS-SV) score \u2265 31 for males and \u2265 33 for females].

Therefore, the results were unlikely to be largely affected by the analyzing parameters. \n\n\n### Exploratory analyses \n  \nThe linear regression analyses revealed a significant positive relationship between the SAS-SV score and the PHQ-9 score (\u03b2 = 0.154,   t   = 2.787,   p   = 0.008), suggesting that problematic smartphone use is associated with a higher level of depressive symptoms. However, no significant mediation effects were observed for any sFC/dFC measure in the relationship between problematic smartphone use and depressive symptoms (no significant indirect effects were observed, as shown in  ). \n  \nResults of the mediation effect analyses on each brain network measures in the relationship between the short version of the smartphone addiction scale (SAS-SV) score and patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) score. \n    \nWhen defining problematic smartphone use with a new cutoff (SAS-SV score \u2265 43 for males and \u2265 42 for females), 17.6% (9/51) of the participants were considered to have a problematic smartphone use. When using such new cutoff points, significant group differences were found between the participants with and without a problematic smartphone use on most brain network measures which showed significant correlations with the SAS-SV score (corrected   p   < 0.05,  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we investigated the possible associations between problematic smartphone use and brain functions in young healthy adults combining both the sFC and dFC analyzing methods. Overall, our results suggested that the severity of smartphone use is associated with significant differences in both the static and dynamic brain network organizations. \n\nFor static brain network properties, our results suggested that higher smartphone use severity is significantly associated with a higher   E   as well as a higher   E   at the global level ( ). Such results were further validated by significant results on the   C   and   L  , which were known to have equivalent meanings to the   E   and   E   ( ;  ). While the neuroimaging studies on problematic smartphone use are growing ( ;  ;  ), the possible effects of problematic smartphone use on these graph-theoretical-based brain network features are still seldom reported. Nevertheless, similar alterations in the brain networks (increased   E   and/or   E  ) have been associated with some common psychiatric diseases such as posttraumatic stress disorder ( ), as well as multiple substance/non-substance addictions such as the nicotine dependence ( ) and Internet gaming addiction ( ). Our results may thus provide preliminary evidence that higher smartphone use severity could be related to changing trends in topological functional brain organizations, which is similar to changes in patients with these disorders. These findings may help to identify at-risk population for smartphone addiction, and guide targeted interventions for further research. \n\nUsing the dynamic network model, our results suggested that problematic smartphone use is associated with a lower temporal variability ( ), which indicates a decreased dynamism of brain networks ( ). Previous studies have proved that there are unignorable dynamic fluctuations in the human brain\u2019s functional organizations ( , ), which is closely related to the cognitive ( ) and emotional ( ) processes. Meanwhile, both excessively increased ( ;  ) and decreased ( ;  ;  ) dynamisms were thought to be reflective of abnormal brain functions. Specially, a decreased dynamism may indicate a disturbance in the information processing across brain regions ( ). Here, our results therefore provide one of the first evidence that problematic smartphone use may decrease the functional brain network dynamism. \n\nAt the subnetwork level, it was found that a higher smartphone use severity is associated with increased sFC strengths within the frontoparietal and cinguloopercular subnetworks ( ), as well as decreased dFC temporal variability within the attention subnetwork ( ). The frontoparietal and cinguloopercular subnetworks are known to be implicated in higher-level cognitive functions ( ;  ). The attention subnetwork is thought to be responsible for the top-down attentional process, whose abnormality is associated with attention deficits ( ;  ). Therefore, it may be hypothesized that these brain subsystems are prominently disrupted by problematic smartphone use, which may be partially related to the smartphone use-caused cognitive impairments ( ) and attention deficits ( ). However, this assumption remains speculative and needs to be tested in further studies, since no cognitive or attentional tests were performed in this study. Additionally, it is noteworthy that in the current study, the sFC and dFC analyses suggested significant smartphone use-associated effects in difference brain subnetworks, indicating that they may reflect different aspects of brain function. This may partly support the opinion that dFC can capture important information ignored by conventional static methodology ( ), and further highlight the value of integrating the sFC and dFC analyses in research on problematic smartphone use. \n\nWhile significant correlations were found between the brain network metrics and SAS-SV score, no significant differences were obtained when directly comparing between the groups of participants with and without a problematic smartphone use ( ). One possible reason is that our sample size is relatively small, which may limit the statistical power of this research; a larger sample might be needed to detect the between-group differences. We also note that based on the commonly-used SAS-SV cutoff points (\u2265 31 for males and \u2265 33 for females), a considerable proportion (56.9%) of participants were found to have a problematic smartphone use. However, such a proportion is much higher than most previous research [e.g., 29.8% in Mainland China ( ), 24.8% in South Korea ( ), and 38.5% in Hong Kong populations ( )]. Here, we thus propose that such a cutoff may be not optimal for the current sample of young Chinese adults. The previous SAS-SV threshold points proposed by the scale developers ( ) may lead to an over-estimated prevalence of problematic smartphone use nowadays, considering that the use of smartphone has been largely increased in recent years and is being frequently engaged with everyday life and work. In fact, such an opinion has also been expressed by other researchers ( ), and may be partly supported by the results of our exploratory analyses using more strict cutoff points ( ). Therefore, further studies may be warranted to investigate if a more applicable SAS-SV cutoff point is required for defining problematic smartphone use in young Chinese nowadays. \n\nPrevious studies have reported that alterations in brain structures may act as a moderator of the relationship between problematic smartphone use and depressive symptoms in young adults ( ). In the current study, on the contrary, no similar mediation effects were found on any sFC/dFC measure ( ). Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that the sample size is relatively low; moreover, only healthy participants were included whose depressive levels were relatively low. Further studies may be warranted to detect possible mediation effects in a larger sample and in clinical populations. \n\nSome other limitations of this study should be noted. First, because of the nature of cross-sectional research, we are unable to determine the causality relationship between problematic smartphone use and brain dysfunctions. Second, as the SAS-SV is a self-reported scale, the results could be biased by potential over-or under-reports. Third, while only the sFC/dFC patterns during rest were analyzed, further studies conducted under specific tasks ( ) may further improve our knowledge. Fourth, in this study, we chose the sliding-window approach to analyze dFC rather than other approaches such as the temporal independent component analysis (tICA), considering that the tICA requires a large number of scanning time points ( ) and the sliding-window approach might be more suitable for the current dataset. Nevertheless, other approaches such as the tICA may provide further important information and can be investigated in the future studies. \n\nIn conclusion, this study showed that problematic smartphone use is associated with differences in brain functions in young healthy adults, as characterized by differences in both static and dynamic brain network organizations. These findings may help to improve our understanding of the biological associates of problematic smartphone use. However, further studies may be warranted to confirm our findings in a larger sample, and to investigate if a more applicable SAS-SV cutoff point is required for defining problematic smartphone use in young Chinese nowadays. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. \n\n\n## Ethics statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by The Ethics Committee of Second Xiangya Hospital.
