Alongside representing another person\u2019s actions or mental states, however, social cognitive processing is also shaped by their (mis)match with one\u2019s own corresponding states. Here, we addressed the distinction between representing others\u2019 states through the action observation or mentalizing networks (i.e.\u00a0representational processing) and detecting the extent to which such states align with one\u2019s own ones (i.e.\u00a0relational processing, mediated by social conflict). We took a meta-analytic approach to unveil the neural bases of both relational and representational processing by focusing on previously reported brain activations from functional magnetic resonance imaging studies using false-belief and action observation tasks. Our findings suggest that relational processing for belief and action states involves, respectively, the left and right temporo-parietal junction, likely contributing to self-other differentiation. Moreover, distinct sectors of the posterior fronto-medial cortex support social conflict processing for belief and action, possibly through the inhibition of conflictual representations. These data might pave the way for further studies addressing social conflict as an important component of normal and pathological processing, and inform the design of rehabilitative treatments for social deficits. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nA core topic in social cognitive neuroscience concerns the role of the mirror and mentalizing brain networks ( ;  ;  ) in understanding others\u2019 behaviours   \u00a0   and decoding their intentions and feelings ( ,  ;  ;  ). Notably, these networks are generally considered to underpin a neural basis for representing these different components of social understanding. \n\nThe mirror network includes inferior frontal, premotor and inferior parietal regions which are activated both when performing an action and when observing the same action performed by someone else ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). This direct matching between action execution and observation is considered to underpin a variety of social functions mediated by a mental representation of another\u2019s actions , such as recognition ( ), imitation learning ( ;  ) and the decoding of intentions signalled by visuomotor and/or contextual cues ( ;  ). The mentalizing system, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), the medial precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex and the temporal poles ( ;  ), is rather activated when\u2014in the lack of informative visuomotor cues\u2014others\u2019 intentions must be inferred in terms of mental states such as thoughts and beliefs ( ). Importantly, the use of different terms such as \u2018theory of mind\u2019, \u2018mentalizing\u2019, \u2018mind-reading\u2019 or \u2018perspective-taking\u2019\u2014typically associated with partly overlapping and partly different meanings\u2014has generated some confusion in the related literature ( ;  ). We therefore chose to use only the term \u2018mentalizing\u2019, that has been associated primarily with the results of neuroimaging studies aimed at characterizing the brain regions involved in representing and understanding others\u2019 mental states (i.e.\u00a0a \u2018mentalizing\u2019 network, e.g.  ). \n\nAlong with representing others\u2019 intentional states, however, evaluating whether they (mis)match with our own ones might represent another crucial prerequisite for effective social communication and interactions. This distinction has been recently conceptualized between representing others\u2019 intentions (be it in terms of mental states or actions), i.e.\u00a0representational processing, and detecting the extent to which such representation is (mis)matching with our own state, i.e.\u00a0relational processing based on monitoring a \u2018social conflict\u2019, i.e.\u00a0a conflict/mismatch between self- and other-related actions or states ( ). \n\nWell before this proposal, however, both representational and relational processing had been implemented in neuroimaging studies with either actions or mental states (e.g., beliefs) as \u2018target\u2019 stimuli. \n\nIn the former case, studies addressing action representation typically compared conditions depicting another\u2019s action   vs   no visible human movement (e.g. scrambled images or object mechanical movements), without action execution ( ;  ). In contrast, studies of action conflict monitoring contrasted conditions eliciting misalignment between performed and attended actions (socially incongruent condition) with conditions in which a same action is both executed and observed (socially congruent condition) ( ;  ;  ). \n\nIn the case of mentalizing, most neuroimaging studies used false-belief tasks requiring to make inferences on another\u2019s mental states   vs   non-mental (e.g. physical) events ( ;  ). Notably, the \u2018false-belief\u2019 and \u2018true-belief\u2019 conditions of this task implicitly elicit, respectively, mismatching (socially incongruent condition) and matching (socially congruent condition) representations across the subject and the story character. While comparing these conditions should thus unveil the regions involved in belief conflict monitoring ( ;  ), this contrast is rather commonly interpreted in terms of mental representation (e.g.  ). In \u2018false-belief\u2019 conditions, the mismatch between one\u2019s own and the other\u2019s knowledge is supposed to prompt the construction of her/his model of the world, i.e.\u00a0mentalizing ( ), rather than supporting the processing of social conflict. Interpreting results under a relational (i.e.\u00a0social conflict), rather than representational, framework might thus help characterizing mechanisms of social cognition that are shared across different social domains, such as action perception and belief understanding, as well as during moral decision-making and understanding of irony, lies and humour ( ). For example, the appreciation of irony and sarcasm may emerge from the interplay between the social verbal cues given by others and the world as interpreted by oneself, rather than reflecting other\u2019s mental-state representation   per se   ( ). \n\nOn this basis, it has been suggested that assessing the correspondence between another\u2019s and our own model of the world might represent the crucial process, providing the most critical information, for social understanding ( ). The latter, and more generally human communication, may depend more on assessing how well one\u2019s knowledge aligns with others\u2019 knowledge than on inferring their mental states. A failure in processing the difference between one\u2019s own and others\u2019 lines of thought might thus be expected to result in social impairments. An ideal benchmark for this hypothesis is represented by autism spectrum disorder, in which social deficits might reflect altered mechanisms of social conflict monitoring rather than difficulties in representing others\u2019 minds, i.e. \u2018mindblindness\u2019 (e.g.  ). This view fits with the observation of TPJ\u2014in which altered activity has been previously reported in autism ( ;  )\u2014as the common neural basis of mechanisms for monitoring social conflicts conveyed both by action perception ( ) and belief understanding ( ). Moreover, neuromodulation of TPJ activity has been shown to influence social conflict monitoring ( ;  ), but not representational measures of actions or mental states ( ;  ). \n\nSome studies, however, failed to report a specific TPJ involvement in social conflict monitoring when comparing false and true-belief conditions ( ;  ) or socially incongruent and congruent conditions in the action\u2013perception domain ( ). Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that social conflict monitoring involves regions other than the TPJ, such as the insula for action perception ( ;  ) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) for both action observation ( ) and false belief ( ). Therefore, the putative exclusive role of TPJ in social conflict monitoring ( ;  ) needs further supporting evidence. A related gap concerns the proposal of TPJ as a \u2018relational\u2019 hub common to distinct social\u2013cognitive domains, possibly receiving input from the motor cortex   vs   areas underlying mental representations when monitoring action conflict   vs   belief conflict, respectively ( ). \n\nOn this basis, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis of previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies with false-belief and action observation tasks to investigate the specific and/or overlapping neural bases of (i) representational processing and (ii) relational processing based on social conflict monitoring. Available evidence (e.g.  ) suggests an involvement of TPJ both for belief and action conflict monitoring. According to   hypothesis, a prominent engagement of TPJ in relational, instead of representational, processing would support a reframing of mentalizing (and probably also other social\u2013cognitive domains) in terms of relational rather than representational processing. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Rationale of the meta-analytic approach \n  \nWe aimed to identify the brain regions consistently associated with relational processing (i.e.\u00a0social conflict monitoring), over and beyond its requirements in terms of representational processing ( ), by focusing on false-belief ( ) and action observation ( ) tasks, respectively. We first pursued this goal with activation likelihood estimation (ALE), a coordinate-based meta-analytic approach using coordinates of peak locations to summarize and integrate published findings ( ). This approach allows to overcome the typical limitations inherent in single neuroimaging experiments, e.g.\u00a0sensitivity to experimental and/or analytic procedures, lack of replication studies and small sample sizes ( ). These constraints are known to increase the likelihood of false negatives ( ), thus pushing researchers towards procedures that, conversely, might promote false positives ( ;  ). \n\nWe first ran four separate ALE analyses addressing the neural processing of belief relational, belief representation, action relational and action representation processes in healthy individuals. Subsequent conjunction and contrast analyses unveiled both common and specific activations across (i) belief relational and belief representation, (ii) action relational and action representation and (iii) belief relational and action relational processing. We did not perform comparison/conjunction analyses of belief and action representational processing because they would not fit our purpose of clarifying the neural bases of relational (  vs   representational) processing. \n\nAll the inclusion criteria for each dataset were selected by the first author and then checked and approved by the other authors. This procedure, entailing a double check by independent investigators, was aimed to reduce the chances of a selection bias ( ). The selection process began in September 2020. M.A and S.P. independently screened the papers for the meta-analyses on false belief and action observation, respectively, and weekly meetings were scheduled to resolve doubts. To further improve the quality of the selection process, at the end of this first selection stage, the two authors exchanged their databases for a cross-check. Finally, the two databases were also checked and approved by the other two authors (Z.C. and N.C.). \n\n\n### Literature search and study selection \n  \n#### Neural bases of belief representation and belief relational processing. \n  \nFollowing Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines ( ;  ) and the guidelines for neuroimaging meta-analysis ( ), we started our survey of the relevant literature by searching for \u2018false-belief fMRI\u2019 on PubMed ( ; research date: 24 August 2021) and by constraining this search to studies on human subjects and written in English. Additional records were identified by searching for \u2018fMRI \u201cfalse-belief task\u201d\u2019 on Google Scholar ( ; research date: 24 August 2021). In the latter search, we used quotation marks to retrieve only papers reporting the \u2018false-belief task\u2019 in the text. While the search was limited to papers written in English, we did not apply temporal filters (e.g. specific years of publication). After duplicate removal, a preliminary pool of 2013 studies was first screened by titles and then by abstracts. We retained only those studies fulfilling the following selection criteria (see\u00a0  for details on the procedure for study selection): \n  \nPRISMA flowchart of literature search and selection process for false-belief task \n    \nStudies written in the English language. \n  \nEmpirical fMRI studies, while excluding review and meta-analysis studies and those employing other techniques, to ensure comparable spatial and temporal resolution. \n  \nStudies reporting whole-brain activation coordinates, rather than regions of interest (ROIs) or results of small-volume correction (SVC). Studies based on ROIs or SVC must be excluded because a prerequisite for fMRI meta-analyses is that convergence across experiments is tested against a null hypothesis of random spatial associations across the entire brain under the assumption that each voxel has the same a priori chance of being activated ( ;  ). \n  \nStudies including drug-free and non-clinical participants to prevent possible differences in brain activity associated with pharmacological manipulations or neuro-psychiatric diseases other than those under investigation. \n  \nStudies with adult subjects (age range: 18\u201360\u2009years). \n  \nA minimum of five participants included in the final analyses, as usually advised for neuroimaging meta-analyses (e.g.  ). \n  \nStudies using the false-belief task to investigate the neural bases of making inferences on another\u2019s beliefs. We selected only studies performing either of these contrasts or both: \n  \nInferences on \u2018true belief > inferences on physical or perceptual aspects\u2019 and inferences on \u2018false belief > inferences on physical or perceptual aspect\u2019. While the first contrast allows to isolate belief representation, the latter contrast leads to the inclusion of studies using \u2018false belief\u2019 as a target condition that entails not only representing another mind but also representing the self-other distinction and social conflict. Importantly, most of the published studies with \u2018false belief\u2019 as a target condition used the \u2018false photograph\u2019 as a control condition in which subjects are required to represent the outdated content of a physical representation such as a photograph. The rationale for choosing this control is that it makes the target and control conditions structurally equivalent (including for the presence of conflict) and differing for their requirements in terms of processing mental states. Importantly, however, there is no evidence that this condition with perceptual conflict can control for social conflict. \n  \nThis selection, however, retained studies contrasting belief and non-belief conditions, while excluding studies in which beliefs were contrasted with low-level baseline conditions such as rest or visual fixation. \n  \nStudies using these contrasts to unveil the neural bases of representing another\u2019s mental states were included in the \u2018belief representational\u2019 meta-analysis. \n  \nInferences on another\u2019s false-belief (socially incongruent/mismatching condition, in which the other person\u2019s mental representation of the situation differs from the participant\u2019s own belief)\u2009>\u2009inferences on another\u2019s true-belief (socially congruent condition, in which the participant\u2019s and another\u2019s beliefs match with each other). Studies using this contrast to isolate the regions engaged in processing the social conflict that is present only in the false-belief condition were included in the \u2018belief relational\u2019 meta-analysis. \n    \nStudies not reporting some of the required information (e.g. participants\u2019 number or age, or coordinates for contrasts of interest) were excluded. Starting from an initial screening of 2013 titles and abstracts, 109 papers deemed as potentially relevant were fully reviewed based on the aforementioned selection criteria\u00a0( ). We thus excluded: 3 review/meta-analysis articles; 6 studies using ROIs or SVC; 3 studies focused on children or ageing populations; 30 studies focusing on other topics or using inappropriate contrasts; 8 studies focused on clinical populations; 14 studies employing techniques other than fMRI and 5 studies not reporting all the required information. This selection phase resulted in a final set of 40 studies fulfilling our selection criteria. \n\nWe then expanded our search for other potentially relevant studies by carefully examining both the studies quoting, and those quoted by, each of these papers, alongside previously published review and meta-analysis papers on similar topics ( ;  ). This second phase highlighted six further studies fitting our search criteria. Studies were classified as \u2018relational mentalizing\u2019 if they required participants to infer a belief conflict and \u2018representational mentalizing\u2019 if they involved belief understanding. Overall, this procedure led to include in the ALE \u2018belief representational\u2019 meta-analysis 33 previously published studies ( ), resulting from 34 experiments (individual comparisons reported) with 769 subjects and 405 activation foci. Instead, the ALE \u2018belief relational\u2019 meta-analysis included 17 previously published studies ( ), resulting from 17 experiments (individual comparisons reported) with 323 subjects and 202 activation foci. \n\n\n#### Neural bases of action representation and action relational processing. \n  \nWe started our survey of the relevant literature by searching for \u2018action observation fMRI\u2019 on PubMed ( ; research date: 24 August 2021) and by constraining this search to studies on human subjects and written in English. Additional records were identified by searching for \u2018fMRI \u201caction observation task\u201d\u2019 on Google Scholar ( ; research date: 24 August 2021). In the latter search, we used quotation marks to retrieve only papers reporting \u2018action observation task\u2019. While the search was limited to papers written in English, we did not apply temporal filters (e.g. specific years of publication). After duplicate removal, a preliminary pool of 1862 studies was first screened by titles and then by abstracts\u00a0( ). While the methodological selection criteria were the same as mentioned earlier ((i)\u2013(vi)), here we selected only studies addressing action observation tasks with either of these contrasts or both: \n  \nPRISMA flowchart of literature search and selection process for action observation tasks. \n    \nAction observation\u2009>\u2009control condition with no visible human action (e.g. objects movement, static pictures of humans or scrambled images), without action execution. This selection retained studies contrasting the visual processing of human actions and complex non-human action stimuli while excluding studies in which actions were contrasted with low-level baseline conditions such as rest or visual fixation. Studies using this contrast to unveil the neural bases of representing observed actions were included in the \u2018action representational\u2019 meta-analysis. \n  \nSocially incongruent action (when there is a mismatch between the action performed by the participants and the one that they observe being performed by someone else)\u2009>\u2009socially congruent action (when the participants\u2019 action is identical to the observed one). Importantly, this comparison is not directly informative about whether the individual represents the other\u2019s action, as the difference between the two conditions refers to a mismatch (i.e.\u00a0social conflict) between the participant\u2019s and other\u2019s actions, and not to a particular action as such. Studies using this type of contrast were included in the \u2018action relational\u2019 meta-analysis. \n  \nStarting from an initial screening of 1862 titles and abstracts, 520 papers deemed as potentially relevant were fully reviewed based on the aforementioned selection criteria\u00a0( ). We thus excluded: 19 review or meta-analysis articles; 27 studies employing techniques other than fMRI; 47 studies using ROIs or SVC; 24 studies focused on children or ageing populations; 30 studies not reporting all the required information; 305 studies focusing on other topics or using inappropriate contrasts, and 13 studies focused on clinical populations. This selection phase resulted in 55 studies fulfilling our selection criteria. \n\nWe then expanded our search for other potentially relevant studies by carefully examining both the studies quoting, and those quoted by, each of these papers, alongside previously published meta-analyses on the neural bases of action observation processing ( ;  ;  ;  ). This second phase highlighted 11 further studies fitting our search criteria. Studies were classified as \u2018relational action processing\u2019 if they required participants to monitor an action conflict and \u2018representational action processing\u2019 if they involved action perception. Overall, this procedure led to include in the ALE \u2018action representational\u2019 meta-analysis 51 previously published studies ( ), resulting from 52 experiments (individual comparisons reported) with 933 subjects and 1006 activation foci. Instead, the ALE \u2018action relational\u2019 meta-analysis included 15 previously published studies ( ), resulting from 15 experiments (individual comparisons reported) with 308 subjects and 194 activation foci. \n\n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nWe performed four ALE analyses, using the GingerALE 3.0.2 software ( ), to identify regions consistently associated with (i) belief representational processing, (ii) belief relational processing, (iii) action representational processing and (iv) action relational processing. We followed the analytic procedure previously described by   and  , based on  . Importantly, the inclusion of multiple contrasts/experiments from the same set of subjects can generate dependence across experiment maps and thus decrease the validity of meta-analytic results. To prevent this issue, for each meta-analysis we adjusted for within-group effects by pooling the coordinates from all the relevant contrasts of a study into one experiment ( ). The number of experiments included in most of these meta-analyses is in line with the recent prescriptions for ALE ( ;  ), suggesting a minimum of 17 experiments to ensure that results would not be driven by single experiments ( ). Only the analysis on action relational processing included less than 17 experiments (i.e. 15). However, this numerosity is in line with   and   meta-analyses on social processing in healthy individuals. \n\nIn all meta-analyses, activation foci were initially interpreted as the centres of three-dimensional Gaussian probability distributions to capture the spatial uncertainty associated with each individual coordinate. All coordinates were reported in the MNI space or converted into this space using the automatic routine implemented in GingerALE. The three-dimensional probabilities of all activation foci in a given experiment were then combined for each voxel, resulting in a modelled activation (MA) map. The union of these maps produces ALE scores describing the convergence of results at each brain voxel ( ). To distinguish \u2018true\u2019 convergence across studies from random convergence (i.e. noise), the ALE scores are compared with an empirically defined null distribution ( ). The latter reflects a random spatial association between experiments, with the within-experiment distribution of foci being treated as a fixed property. A random-effects inference is thus invoked by focusing on the above-chance convergence between different experiments and not on the clustering of foci within a specific experiment. From a computational standpoint, deriving this null hypothesis involved sampling a voxel at random from each MA map and taking the union of the resulting values. The ALE score obtained under this assumption of spatial independence was recorded, and the permutation procedure was iterated 1000 times to obtain a sufficient sample of the ALE null distribution. The \u2018true\u2019 ALE scores were tested against the ALE scores obtained under the null distribution and thresholded at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, corrected for cluster-level family-wise error, and the cluster-level threshold was set at   P  \u2009<\u20090.01 to identify the above-chance convergence in each analysis. \n\nThe resulting maps were then fed into direct comparisons and conjunction analyses, within GingerALE, to unveil the common and specific brain activations across (i) belief representation and belief relational, (ii) action representation and action relational, and (iii) belief relational and action relational processing. \n\nFor each comparison, a conjunction image was created, using the voxel-wise minimum value of the included ALE images, to display the similarity between datasets ( ). In the same analysis, two ALE contrast images were created and compared by directly subtracting one input image from the other. To correct for sampling errors, GingerALE creates such data by pooling the foci in each dataset and randomly dividing them into two new groupings equivalent in size to the original datasets. An ALE image is created for each new dataset, then subtracted from the other and compared with the true data. Permutation calculations are then used to compute a voxel-wise   P  -value image indicating where the values of the \u2018true data\u2019 fall within the distribution of values in any single voxel. To simplify the interpretation of ALE contrast images, significant ALE subtraction scores were converted to Z scores. For contrast analyses, we used a threshold set at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, using 10\u2009000 permutations, and a minimum volume size of 100 mm . \n\nAnatomical labelling of all clusters was automatically generated by GingerALE ( ). Moreover, we used the Statistical Parametric Mapping Anatomy Toolbox (v.2.2c;  ), as well as the AAL template (as implemented in MRIcron;  ) and Neurosynth ( ), to double-check these localizations. \n\n\n### Publication bias \n  \nThe generalizability of coordinate-based meta-analyses is hampered by the exclusion of studies that are not published, typically due to the lack of statistically significant findings. We took two distinct approaches to assure the robustness of our ALE meta-analytic findings against such publication bias (i.e.\u00a0the higher likelihood of positive, compared with negative, findings to be reported). Namely, we calculated (i) the relationship between number of participants and number of significant findings reported (e.g. foci detected) ( ,  ;  ), and (ii) for each cluster of each meta-analysis, the fail-safe number (FSN) ( ). \n\nThe rationale for the former approach is that a negative correlation between sample size and number of foci is typical of analyses with publication bias, where studies with small samples are published only if their results match a priori hypotheses ( ). Against this possible confound, for none of the performed ALE meta-analyses we observed a significant negative correlation between sample size and number of foci [action relational:   r  (13)\u2009=\u20090.504,   P  \u2009=\u20090.055; action representation:   r  (50)\u2009=\u20090.069,   P  \u2009=\u20090.628; belief relational:   r  (15)\u2009=\u20090.092,   P  \u2009=\u20090.617; belief representational:   r  (32)\u2009=\u20090.158,   P  \u2009=\u20090.373]. \n\nWe additionally carried out an FSN analysis ( ) to further ensure the robustness of our findings against unpublished studies with null results in the \u2018file drawer\u2019 (e.g. driven by a bias towards publishing positive results). This approach entails investigating the effect of adding null-result experiments (i.e.\u00a0null studies) to the original database of studies included in the meta-analysis ( ). Null-result experiments were created in R 3.6.1 ( ), using   R code and guidelines to match the real experiments in terms of sample size and number of foci reported, but with foci being distributed randomly across the brain. The resulting null experiments were then used to perform new meta-analyses addressing the FSN. The latter represents the number of noise studies (i.e.\u00a0fMRI studies with non-significant results) that can be added to an ALE meta-analysis before a cluster is no longer significant. In practical terms, this approach entails assessing whether the FSN is below the lower bound (indicating non-robustness against publication bias) or above the upper bound (indicating that results are driven by a small number of hyper-influential studies). When the FSN lies between these boundaries, results can be considered sufficiently robust against the publication bias and driven by at least the desired minimum number of contributing studies. Following  , we pre-specified lower and upper boundaries for the FSN of each cluster based on the following considerations. A recent modelling approach to data included in the BrainMap database ( ) suggests a rate of publication bias of up to 30% (i.e.\u00a0up to 30 unpublished null studies per 100 published neuroimaging studies;  ). We thus pre-specified that the FSN for each cluster should exceed a lower boundary of 30% of the real data (e.g. with 52 experiments, the minimum FSN is defined as 16). As to the upper boundary, each cluster is expected to be driven by at least 10% of the included studies. Accordingly, the upper boundary of the FSN was calculated per cluster as follows: ((number of studies contributing to a cluster)/0.1))\u2009\u2212\u2009(total number of studies included in the ALE meta-analysis). Only if the actual FSN obtained is between these two boundaries, the cluster can be assumed to be robust against both a potential file drawer effect and the effect of few hyper-influential experiments. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Action representational processing \n  \nRepresenting another\u2019s actions was associated with consistent activations in some of the key nodes of the mirror network, i.e.\u00a0bilateral occipito-temporal (fusiform and inferior occipital gyri) and posterior lateral temporal (inferior, middle and superior temporal gyri) cortex , extending into the IPL, as well as in the left superior parietal lobule\u00a0( ;  ). \n  \nThe neural bases of action representational processing.

Along with representing others\u2019 motor and mental states, however, assessing their correspondence with our own ones might provide even more critical information for social understanding ( ). This relational facet of social cognition entails monitoring social conflicts conveyed by action perception ( ) and belief understanding ( ). While converging evidence suggests the role of TPJ in social conflict monitoring ( ), however, this proposal requires further supporting data ( ;  ). We addressed this issue by investigating the neural bases of representational and relational processing via coordinate-based meta-analyses of previous neuroimaging studies on false beliefs and action observation. \n\nTo ground our investigation in a detailed characterization of the neural bases of social understanding, we first assessed simple conditions and direct comparisons to confirm previous evidence about the neural bases of processing actions and beliefs, respectively. The former process engaged fundamental components of the action observation network ( ), including temporo-parietal regions involved in processing multisensory information ( ) and in sensorimotor transformations underpinning tool use ( ) ( ). In contrast, representing others\u2019 beliefs, regardless of one\u2019s own ones, recruited the precuneus, TPJ, anterolateral temporal cortex and the rostral sector of dmPFC\u00a0( ). These regions have been associated with the multiple subprocesses of mentalizing, and particularly constructing and taking distinct perspectives, mediated by the precuneus ( ;  ) and dmPFC ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ), respectively, via the retrieval of episodic and autobiographical memories. While the TPJ has been typically associated with transient mental inferences about people ( ;  ), the recruitment of temporo-parietal regions by tasks involving the reorientation of attention and a sense of agency ( ) led to suggest that they might support mentalizing via attentional reorienting ( ). The latter hypothesis might help explaining the neural bases of relational processing, mostly involving regions adjacent to those associated with representation processing in the same domain, including distinct sectors of the TPJ. \n\nIn the action domain, relational processing indeed involved bilateral parietal/temporo-parietal areas and right-hemispheric premotor regions adjacent to, and partially overlapping with, the main nodes of the action observation network, alongside a posterior fronto-medial cluster encompassing the pre-SMA and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex\u00a0( ). The role of these regions in relational action processing might relate to previous reports of their engagement in imitation inhibition ( ;  ). A functional distinction has been proposed for the TPJ and mPFC during imitation control, i.e.\u00a0distinguishing between self- and other-generated actions and inhibiting the other-generated action to enforce the self-generated one ( ), respectively. The former function might support the TPJ role in processing social visuo-spatial conflict while concurrently generating a sense of agency, i.e.\u00a0the feeling of being an entity performing an action localized in a specific space and perceiving the social world from this position and perspective ( ). \n\nIn the belief domain, relational processing involved the left middle temporal cortex, extending into the TPJ and inferior parietal cortex, alongside the dmPFC\u00a0( ). While complementing previous fMRI ( ) and electroencephalography ( ) evidence of TPJ involvement in false-belief understanding, these findings suggest that, also in the belief domain, this region might underpin relational processing by mediating self-other control processes. Distinguishing between self- and other-generated states indeed represents a crucial prerequisite for the subsequent mentalizing stage, i.e.\u00a0inhibiting one\u2019s own mental state to enhance others\u2019 ones ( ;  ), likely involving the mPFC ( ). In the false-belief task, this inhibitory process may support the inhibition of the true state of reality, also referred to as the \u2018default\u2019 state of belief representation ( ). In this framework, false-belief performance is spontaneously driven by the true state of reality until participants detect the social conflict between their own (true) and the other/character\u2019s (false) beliefs. Solving this social conflict, once this is made explicit by TPJ-mediated self-other control processes ( ;  ), might additionally require the dorsal mPFC for inhibiting the spontaneous tendency to respond according to one\u2019s own beliefs ( ). \n\nImportantly, an interpretation of TPJ activity in terms of arbitration of social conflict between self- and other-related states fits with several relevant results regarding its role in other social\u2013cognitive domains. For instance, the putative TPJ involvement in coding the difference between expected and observed outcomes (i.e.\u00a0a \u2018social prediction error\u2019;  ; for a review, see  ) might also be interpreted as a social conflict processing between character\u2019s belief on, and participant\u2019s perception of, the subsequent real outcome ( ). Moreover, in moral decision processing, TPJ activity is specifically associated with tasks generating a \u2018social conflict\u2019, such as attempted harm and accident, which in turn fits with the possible role of this region in processing the mismatch between character\u2019s belief and participant\u2019s perception of the real outcome ( ). \n\nWhile confirming the pattern highlighted by single conditions and direct comparisons, conjunction analyses within each domain provided further insights into the functional characterization of shared processes across representational and relational processing. A common activity in the action domain was found in the left temporo-parietal cortex\u00a0( ), whose involvement in encoding observed actions and invariant recognition of others\u2019 actions ( ,  ) was found to depend, respectively, on the effector and the type of observed motor act regardless of the effector ( ). Instead, the common engagement of the left middle temporal cortex and TPJ by belief-related representational and relational processing\u00a0( ) might reflect their role in a superordinate requirement for mentalizing such as the storage of, and access to, socio-semantic knowledge ( ;  ). \n\nA focus on relational processing confirmed the engagement of the right TPJ and premotor cortex in action processing, and of the left TPJ and postero-temporal cortex in belief processing, respectively\u00a0( ). Moreover, both processes recruited the posterior fronto-medial cortex and the pre-SMA, in which adjacent clusters were selectively associated with action- and belief-related relational processing, respectively. \n\nThe observed lateralization of TPJ provides novel insights into the debate about the\u2014possibly different\u2014functional roles of its left- and right-hemispheric sectors. On the one hand, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the left or right TPJ modulates performance on both inhibition of imitation and visual perspective-taking ( ). Other findings, however, support their putative functional distinction in social cognitive processing. The left TPJ has been associated with tasks requiring to take a de-centred perspective, such as visual perspective-taking ( ), false-belief processing ( ;  ) and strategic decision-making with other humans ( ). Instead, inhibition of imitation might represent a superordinate function of the right TPJ ( ;  ), with its response being modulated by the perception of human agency (i.e.\u00a0action monitoring;  ; also in the condition of visual deprivation;  ) and by the presence of animacy cues leading to believe that an interaction partner is human ( ). In line with this hypothesis, imitation performance is influenced by TMS-mediated modulation of the right TPJ ( ;  ). \n\nThis view of TPJ engagement in perspective-taking has been refined in distinct directions. On the one hand, this role seems limited to social inferences such as \u2018considering the perspective of another agent\u2019 rather than \u2018the perspective of an arrow\u2019 ( ). Moreover, the observed involvement of the posterior part of TPJ in processing self-other distinctions at the mental-state level ( ) fits with previous evidence that this sector underpins mentalizing and internally directed attention by deactivating the neighbouring anterior portion ( ). By showing that only the posterior part of the right TPJ is associated with belief conflict processing, while the anterior part is involved in action conflict monitoring, our results suggest that previous conflicting results concerning lateralization effects might be biased by targeting its different functional subdivisions. Altogether, these findings suggest that the TPJ role in processing self-other distinctions supports the monitoring of social conflicts conveyed by neural representations of both actions ( ) and mental states (e.g. beliefs;  ) involving the premotor and postero-temporal cortex, respectively. \n\nAdjacent, and partially overlapping, activations for action- and belief-related relational processing were found in the pre-SMA ( ) and in the posterior fronto-medial cortex (  \u00a0  ) (cyan in\u00a0 ). In addition to action monitoring ( ), the activity of pre-SMA has been associated with social evaluation (e.g.  ), probably reflecting both sensorimotor and emotional aspects of social interactions, such as contagiousness of laughter ( ) or empathic response ( ). \n\nAmong the several functions that have been ascribed to the posterior fronto-medial cortex (e.g.  ;  ;  ), executive functioning ( ;  ;  ) supports inhibition control ( ) and cognitive control ( ), in turn representing a crucial prerequisite for monitoring social conflicts ( ) both in the action ( ) and belief ( ;  ;  ) domains. In particular, the medial frontal cortex is considered to manage the social conflict between self- and other-generated actions, once these are distinguished by the TPJ, enforcing the former and the associated first-person intention ( ;  ). In the action domain, an inherent aspect of this process is represented by the top-down modulation of imitation ( ), possibly explaining the disrupted inhibition of imitation displayed by patients with frontal lesions ( ;  ), and their tendency to automatically imitate even when they are clearly instructed to not do so ( ). The present evidence that the posterior fronto-medial cortex is also involved in belief conflict monitoring might help explain its role in mentalizing by subserving the representation of intentional states for both self and other ( ). Its activation during the outcome phase of false-belief tasks, when expectations about the object location can be violated ( ), might indeed reflect its role in managing \u2018relational\u2019 social conflicts.   reported the activation of frontal executive-control regions during false-   vs   true-belief processing, reflecting the need to inhibit self-perspective. Overall, mentalizing judgements would be thus supported by multiple processes such as distinguishing and switching between one\u2019s own and another\u2019s beliefs through the TPJ and posterior fronto-medial cortex, respectively ( ). Interestingly, a similar pattern of brain activity has been also reported during implicit false-belief processing ( ;  ). Causal supporting evidence for this proposal comes from neuromodulation studies showing either up- and down-regulation of egocentric biases, associated with a consistent decrease and increase of the influence of another\u2019s mental or visuo-spatial perspective, after low-frequency repetitive TMS ( ) or anodal tDCS ( ), respectively. According to the authors, stimulating the posterior fronto-medial cortex might enhance the integration of information about another\u2019s mental ( ) or visuo-spatial ( ) perspective into one\u2019s own. While the latter hypothesis requires further supporting evidence, the data collected so far suggest that the posterior fronto-medial cortex participates in social conflict monitoring both by enhancing the required belief or action responses, and by inhibiting the automatic tendency to report the true belief or to imitate ( ,  ;  ;  ). \n\nMethodological guidelines for coordinate neuroimaging meta-analyses led to select only studies performing the whole-brain analysis ( ). It is important to stress, however, that similar results on the role of the TPJ and posterior fronto-medial cortex in processing social conflict have been also reported by studies in which strong a priori hypotheses justified ROI analyses or SVC procedures [e.g.  ;  ;  ; see   for a meta-analysis based on ROIs]. \n\nConsidering   hypothesis, our rigorous approach provided results supporting the role of the left TPJ in belief conflict processing, through the distinction between self- and other-related states, rather than to belief representation   per se  . However, unlike   predictions and   findings, we did not provide conclusive evidence for the involvement of the right TPJ in false-belief processing. Moreover, we also reported unexpected evidence , such as the right TPJ activity in association with action (  vs   belief) conflict processing, and the role of the posterior fronto-medial cortex in both action and belief conflict processing, through the inhibition of conflictual representations. \n\nImportantly, unveiling the properties and neural bases of relational processing might help extend current perspectives of impaired social cognition and communication (e.g.  ). Based on the considerable individual variability in perceiving or interpreting even a same event ( ;  ), social communication and interactions may depend on tracking how well present information about others aligns with one\u2019s own perspective even more than inferring their states. Impairments in detecting, processing or solving experiential differences are thus expected to reflect in altered social communication and/or interactions. In line with this hypothesis, several populations\u2014including young children ( ) and non-human primates ( )\u2014display altered performance in false-belief tasks despite the normal understanding of true-belief situations. This evidence confirms that generating another\u2019s specific representation of the world in false-belief paradigms is qualitatively different from, and more difficult than, attributing one\u2019s own one like in true-belief situations ( ;  ). Indeed, growing evidence suggests that the multifaceted pattern of social deficits observed in autism may reflect subtle issues with monitoring social conflict, rather than altered representational abilities or \u2018mindblindness\u2019 altogether ( ;  ). This hypothesis has been recently assessed with an implicit false-belief task ( ) merely requiring to respond when a visual target is detected while holding constant belief manipulations as in the Sally\u2013Anne task. It might be speculated that RTs reflect participants\u2019 belief about the stimulus location ( ;  ). Instead, another person\u2019s belief that the target would be present can speed up target detection, even though participants themselves had been convinced that the target would not be present ( ;  ). In this context, an account of autism centred on impaired mentalizing, and thus on the lack of belief representations ( ), would not be expected to predict this contribution to detection performance. Instead, strong autistic traits were associated with slowed responses when participants\u2014after being convinced of the stimulus absence\u2014were informed about another\u2019s, opposite, belief. This finding suggests a preserved representation of the other person\u2019s belief, associated with altered monitoring/resolution of social conflicts between that representation and one\u2019s own one, particularly when the latter must be expressed ( ). This conclusion is strengthened by an explicit experimental paradigm showing that the impact of others\u2019 false beliefs is enhanced, in autistic individuals more than controls, when the task requires to verbalize their own mental state ( ). While further evidence is required to evaluate the contribution of altered relational processing, these data at least suggest that autistic individuals\u2019 social impairment is not fully explained by a \u2018representational\u2019 framework, i.e.\u00a0by difficulties in representing others\u2019 intentions\u2014be it in terms of mental states or actions\u2014  per se  . These data therefore suggest that autistic individuals\u2019 social impairment might be better explained by altered relational, than representational, processing and that the autistic brain might fail to monitor the social conflict between one\u2019s own and others\u2019\u2014properly represented\u2014actions or mental states. This hypothesis fits with the evidence that, at the neural level, the difficulties of autistic patients with social conflict processing are associated with decreased TPJ activity ( ). \n\nThis hypothesis has already been translated into potential treatment strategies, with participants being trained to either imitate or inhibit imitation, and thus to either represent another\u2019s actions or monitor action conflict ( ). Within a \u2018relational\u2019 framework, training action conflict monitoring (rather than action representation) was expected to improve mentalizing task comparing incongruent with congruent social conditions. Training to monitor action conflict, compared with training to represent others\u2019 actions, was indeed associated with improved performance on this mentalizing task. By showing a transfer from the trained monitoring of action conflict to the monitoring of conflictual mental (rather than action) representations, these results suggest the existence of (at least partially) common underlying processes of social conflict monitoring transcending single domains. These data support the notion that imitation\u2013inhibition training enhances self-other distinction processing, which in turn facilitates improved performance on both the imitation\u2013inhibition and mentalizing tasks. Our results support this view by showing a common engagement of the posterior fronto-medial cortex for both action- and belief-related relational processing, alongside domain-specific sectors in adjacent posterior fronto-medial regions and in the left- and right-hemispheric TPJ sectors. Overall, this pattern of findings highlights the potential effect of training social conflict monitoring in rehabilitation protocols for autistic patients, possibly in conjunction with neuromodulation techniques targeting the TPJ and/or posterior fronto-medial regions shown by the present meta-analytic results. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nA limitation of our work is the selection of \u201csuboptimal\u201d contrasts to study belief representational processing, i.e. (i) true belief\u2009>\u2009control non-mental condition and (ii) false belief\u2009>\u2009false photograph. Neither contrasts, indeed, are free from limitations. The former contrast allows to control for the structure of the stimuli, but in the target \u201ctrue-belief\u201d condition participants might rely only on their own mental states, possibly attributed to the story character, without necessarily generating a representation of the character\u2019s mental states ( ). The second contrast, using the \u201cfalse-belief\u201d condition as a target condition, addresses not only mental-state representation but also social conflict. There is no evidence that the \u201cfalse-photograph\u201d condition (with perceptual conflict) can control for social conflict. At this stage, how to address the representation of mental states, while isolating this process from the representation of one\u2019s own mental states and from social conflict between one\u2019s own and others\u2019 mental states, remains controversial. \n\nA partial solution is provided by   study. In this experiment, as in a classical Sally\u2013Anne false-belief task, participants are asked to predict which boxes a character would open based on the scenario presented. Each scenario entails three randomly ordered statements, concerning character\u2019s belief, character\u2019s desire and reality (about the location of the desired object). Such randomized order ensured participants\u2019 encoding of the character\u2019s true belief on at least 50% of trials in which they did not already know the object\u2019s true location. This design therefore allowed to address the weakness of several studies in which participants could provide the correct answer, even when ignoring a character\u2019s beliefs on true-belief trials, by merely relying on their own knowledge of reality. Isolating \u2018mental-state representation\u2019 would require comparing this type of the \u2018true-belief\u2019 condition with a non-mental control condition. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur work provides novel neural evidence showing specific brain activity for belief and action conflict processing. This evidence supports the unique status of relational processing, i.e.\u00a0the ability to evaluate whether, how and how much others\u2019 states (mis)match with our own ones, which might represent an even more important prerequisite for effective social communication and interactions than representing those states via the action observation or mentalizing network. The present findings suggest that this process involves adjacent sectors of the posterior fronto-medial cortex, differing in their selectivity to the action or belief domains, whereby social conflict processing is supported by the inhibition of conflictual representations ( ), as well as the left and right TPJ, likely contributing to self-other differentiation for mental and action states, respectively. These findings pave the way for further studies on the main building blocks of normal and pathological social cognition, and for the design of rehabilitative treatment protocols based on their neurocognitive characterization. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9976764, "text_md5": "b855619259e472d36ddcbc8f2043de9c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 76], "journal": [77, 101], "publication_year": [103, 107], "title": [118, 231], "keywords": [245, 330], "abstract": [343, 1859], "body": [1868, 60140]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 36695428, "doi": "10.1093/scan/nsad003", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9976764", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9976764"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9976764\">9976764</a>", "list_title": "PMC9976764  Relational vs representational social cognitive processing: a coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data"}
