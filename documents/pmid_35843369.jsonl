Here, we provide 1) a state-of-art qualitative review of RT-fMRI-NF studies aiming at alleviating clinical symptoms in a psychiatric population; 2) a quantitative evaluation (meta-analysis) of RT-fMRI-NF effectiveness on various psychiatric disorders and 3) methodological suggestions for future studies. Thirty-one clinical trials focusing on psychiatric disorders were included and categorized according to standard diagnostic categories. Among the 31 identified studies, 22 consisted of controlled trials, of which only eight showed significant clinical improvement in the experimental vs. control group after the training. Nine studies found an effect at follow-up on ADHD symptoms, emotion dysregulation, facial emotion processing, depressive symptoms, hallucinations, psychotic symptoms, and specific phobia. Within-group meta-analysis revealed large effects of the NF training on depressive symptoms right after the training (g\u00a0=\u00a00.81, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and at follow-up (g\u00a0=\u00a01.19, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), as well as medium effects on anxiety (g\u00a0=\u00a00.44,\u00a0p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and emotion regulation (g\u00a0=\u00a00.48, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Between-group meta-analysis showed a medium effect on depressive symptoms (g\u00a0=\u00a00.49, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and a large effect on anxiety (g\u00a0=\u00a00.77, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). However, the between-studies heterogeneity is very high. The use of RT-fMRI-NF as a treatment for psychiatric symptoms is promising, however, further double-blind, multicentric, randomized-controlled trials are warranted.
