In particular, head motion can reduce analytical efficiency, and its effects are still present even after preprocessing. To examine the validity of motion removal and to evaluate the remaining effects of motion on the quality of the preprocessed fMRI data, a new metric of group quality control (QC), dissimilarity of functional connectivity, is introduced. Here, we investigate the association between head motion, represented by mean framewise displacement, and dissimilarity of functional connectivity by applying four preprocessing methods in two independent resting\u2010state fMRI datasets: one consisting of healthy participants (  N   =\u2009167) scanned in a 3T GE\u2010Discovery 750 with longer TR (2.5\u2009s), and the other of chronic back pain patients (  N   =\u2009143) in a 3T Siemens Magnetom Prisma scanner with shorter TR (0.555\u2009s). We found that dissimilarity of functional connectivity uncovers the influence of participant's motion, and this relationship is independent of population, scanner, and preprocessing method. The association between motion and dissimilarity of functional connectivity, and how the removal of high\u2010motion participants affects this association, is a new strategy for group\u2010level QC following preprocessing. \n  \nDissimilarity of functional connectivity uncovers the influence of participant's motion, and this relationship is independent of population, scanner, and preprocessing method. Participants with the greatest motion determined the strength of the association between motion and dissimilarity of functional connectivity. A new group\u2010based quality control strategy is proposed: if a group data set is large enough, participants with large motion in the data set be removed to make the regression slope of the association as flat as possible.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nHead motion always exists during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions, particularly when children, elderly, and patients (e.g., with chronic pain or Parkinson's disease) are scanned (Alfaro\u2010Almagro et al.,  ; Igata et al.,  ; Malfliet et al.,  ; Satterthwaite et al.,  ; Yuan et al.,  ). Moreover, head motion is considered one of the major confounding factors impairing the quality of functional MRI (fMRI) data and consequently reducing analytical efficiency (Ciric et al.,  ). Thus, a wide variety of preprocessing methods have been proposed to mitigate motion\u2010related artifacts prior to analysis. These methods include (a) the conventional method (Baliki et al.,  ), which covers motion correction (Jenkinson, Bannister, Brady, & Smith,  ), slice\u2010time correction (Sladky et al.,  ), low\u2010frequency signal drift ( Smith et al.,  ), spatial smoothing (Smith & Brady,  ), band\u2010pass temporal filtering, and regressions of physiological signals within white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), motion\u2010related parameters, and global signal (Murphy, Birn, Handwerker, Jones, & Bandettini,  ); (b) the scrubbing method, which involves removing volumes that exceed some motion threshold (Power et al.,  ); and two ICA\u2010based methods; (c) Automatic Removal of Motion Artifacts (ICA\u2010AROMA) (Pruim et al.,  ); and (d) FMRIB's ICA\u2010based Xnoiseifier (FIX) (Salimi\u2010Khorshidi et al.,  ). At the participant level, the aforementioned methods could greatly reduce motion\u2010related artifacts based on a series of benchmarks (Parkes, Fulcher, Yucel, & Fornito,  ); however, it is conceivable that none of the methods are able to remove all artifacts in the presence of head motion to such a level that compares to the ideal no\u2010motion condition. Specifically, even minor motion between volumes during image acquisition will contribute to major intensity shifts in BOLD data (Parkes et al.,  ; Zaitsev, Akin, LeVan, & Knowles,  ), which will influence the correlations between signals depending on the waveforms of the confounds. Thus, it is imperative to develop group\u2010based quality control (QC) strategies, examine the validity of motion removal, and evaluate the remaining effects of motion on the quality of the preprocessed fMRI data. \n\nOne group\u2010based QC strategy is to select the participant\u2010level preprocessing method that minimizes a group\u2010level metric of motion. For example, QC\u2010FC correlation is a commonly used group\u2010level metric in which motion, represented by mean framewise displacement (FD) over all volumes, is correlated with all possible pair\u2010wise functional connectivity (FC) correlations across participants in a group, reflecting the extent to which motion may modulate FC (Power, Schlaggar, & Petersen,  ). Another strategy, derived from the central limit theorem (Paulauskas & Rachkauskas,  ), is to remove participant(s) with motion\u2010related features that stand out from the rest in the group. In (Huang et al.,  ), a motion\u2010related feature, similarity of FC (SoFC), was introduced, in which the participants with a mean similarity of less than 2   SD  s from the average of the healthy control or patient group were excluded from further analyses. However, this participant\u2010level removal of motion effect assumes that the distributions of motion\u2010related features of groups from different populations are approximately equivalent; this assumption is violated by our observation that patients generally have greater motion than healthy participants. As a consequence, it may introduce systematic bias, which may be especially pronounced in group comparisons between patients and controls (Parkes et al.,  ). In this paper, we suggest a new group\u2010level QC metric, which is an extension of QC\u2010FC correlations, to quantify how an individual participant's motion affects the quality of preprocessed fMRI data. Based on this metric, a new group\u2010based QC strategy is proposed, wherein participants in either healthy or patient groups will be removed to maximally reduce the coupling between motion and FC at the group level. \n\nAccordingly, in this paper, first, a new group\u2010based QC metric, SoFC, is introduced in detail. Following this, the relationship between head motion, represented by FD and dissimilarity of FC with four commonly used preprocessing methods, is investigated in two independent resting\u2010state fMRI datasets: one consisting of healthy participants scanned in a GE scanner with longer TR and the other of chronic back pain (CBP) patients in a Siemens scanner with shorter TR. Finally, after exploring the effect of removing participants with the greatest amount of motion in a given group on the SoFC, a new group\u2010based QC strategy is proposed. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA total of 310 participants from two independent studies were included. Study 1 (healthy participants) was carried out at Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China, and included 167 healthy volunteers (83 males, 84 females; age [mean\u2009\u00b1   SD  ] = 40.9 \u00b1\u200914.1\u2009years old) who were pain\u2010free for at least 52\u2009weeks prior to recruitment. Study 2 (CBP participants) was carried out at Northwestern University, IL, and consisted of 143 of CBP patients (71 males, 72 females; age = 52.5 \u00b1\u200913.6\u2009years old) with pain that persisted for at least 12\u2009weeks prior to recruitment. Participants were excluded if they (a) were less than 18 or greater than 85\u2009years old; (b) reported a history of head injury and/or cerebral disease (e.g., stroke or encephalopathy); (c) had diabetes or a psychiatric disease; (d) reported a history of brain neurosurgical procedures and/or epilepsy; (e) were unable to cooperate (e.g., psychogenic or cognitively impaired); (f) reported pregnancy, drug dependence, or drug abuse; (g) were not suitable for MRI scan; or (h) were enrolled in other clinical trial(s) involving investigational drug(s). \n\nThe studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, China and of Northwestern University, and all participants reviewed and signed a written informed consent. \n\n\n###  MRI   scanning parameters \n  \nAll participants were scanned for structural and resting\u2010state fMRI (rs\u2010fMRI) and were instructed to keep their eyes open and to remain as still as possible during acquisition. Healthy participants were scanned on a 3 Tesla GE\u2010Discovery 750 whole body scanner equipped with an eight channel\u2010head/neck coil. T1\u2010anatomical brain images were acquired with the following parameters: voxel size = 1 \u00d7\u20091 \u00d7\u20091\u2009mm ; repetition time/echo time (TR/TE) = 7.7/3.4 ms; flip angle = 12\u00b0; in\u2010plane resolution = 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256; slices per volume = 176; field of view = 256\u2009mm. Rs\u2010fMRI images were acquired on the same day with the following parameters: TR/TE = 2,500/30\u2009ms; flip angle = 90\u00b0; voxel size = 3.4375\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4375\u2009\u00d7\u20093.5\u2009mm ; in\u2010plane resolution = 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964; number of volumes = 230; number of slices = 42 acquired with interleaved ordering, which covers the whole brain from the cerebellum to the vertex. \n\nCBP participants were scanned on a clinical 3 Tesla Siemens Magnetom Prisma whole body scanner equipped with a 64 channel\u2010head/neck coil. T1\u2010anatomical brain images were acquired using integrated parallel imaging techniques (GRAPPA) with the following parameters: voxel size = 1 \u00d7\u20091 \u00d7\u20091\u2009mm ; TR/TE = 2.3 s/2.40\u2009ms; flip angle = 9\u00b0; in\u2010plane resolution = 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256; slices per volume = 176; field of view = 256\u2009mm. Rs\u2010fMRI images were acquired on the same day with the following parameters: TR/TE = 555/22\u2009ms; flip angle = 47\u00b0; voxel size = 2 \u00d7\u20092 \u00d7\u20092\u2009mm ; in\u2010plane resolution = 96\u2009\u00d7\u2009104; number of volumes = 1,110; multiband accelerator = 8; number of slices = 64 acquired with interleaved ordering, which covers the whole brain from the cerebellum to the vertex. \n\n\n### Measurement of head motion \n  \nFD is a measure of head motion of one volume from one time point to the next, and is calculated as the sum of absolute value of the three translational displacements (  x  ,   y  , and   z  ) and the three rotational displacements (pitch, yaw, and roll, in radians); the latter were multiplied by 50 to convert to arc length displacements in the same units as translational displacements (i.e.,  ) (Power et al.,  ). Mean FD (mFD), calculated as the average FD across all time points except the first one, represents the extent of head motion over the duration of the scan. \n\n\n### Calculating SoFC within a group \n  \nFC represents symmetrical statistical associations among brain regions of interest (ROIs) and is defined as the temporal correlations between BOLD signals of different ROIs. SoFC represents the resemblance of FC of one participant to all other participants within a group. Figure   depicts the calculation of SoFC within a group comprising   N   participants. As shown in Figure  , for each participant, 264 ROIs defined in (Power et al.,  ) were used to construct ROI\u2010based pairwise FC. The BOLD signal of each ROI was extracted as the average over voxels within 10\u2009mm diameter spheres centered at peak coordinates. Following this, a 264\u2009\u00d7\u2009264 correlation matrix was generated, consisting of Pearson correlation coefficients between BOLD signals. The upper (or lower) triangular correlation matrix of each participant was then transformed into a vector; these vectors were combined to create a (264\u2009\u00d7\u2009263)/2 \u00d7   N   matrix, each column of which represents FC of each participant across all pairs of the 264 ROIs (Figure  ). Finally, correlation coefficients of FC of   N   participants were calculated and an   N   \u00d7   N   matrix was generated. After excluding the diagonal, column means were calculated to obtain the similarity of each participant's FC to the rest of the sample (Figure  ). \n  \nDiagram illustrates main steps required to calculate similarity of functional connectivity within a group. (a) For each participant in a group comprising   N   participants, 264 regions of interest (ROIs) defined in (Power et al.,  ) were used to construct ROI\u2010based functional networks. The BOLD signal of each ROI was extracted as an average over voxels within 10\u2009mm diameter spheres centered at peak coordinates. Following this, a 264\u2009\u00d7\u2009264 correlation matrix was generated using Pearson correlation coefficients between BOLD signals. (b) The upper (or lower) triangular correlation matrix of each participant was transformed into a vector; these vectors were combined to create (264\u2009\u00d7\u2009263)/2 \u00d7   N   matrix, each column of which represents functional connectivity of each participant across all pairs of the 264 ROIs. (c) Correlation coefficients of functional connectivity of   N   participants were calculated and a   N   \u00d7   N   matrix was generated; the average of each column excluding the diagonal was calculated, representing the similarity of each participant's functional connectivity to the rest of the sample \n  \n\n###  Rs\u2010fMRI   data preprocessing \n  \nIn this study, to explore the relationship between head motion represented by mFD and SoFC for both healthy and CBP participants and to investigate the effect of preprocessing methods on the relationship, four commonly used methods\u2014  conventional   (Baliki et al.,  ),   scrub   (Power et al.,  ),   ICA\u2010AROMA   (Pruim et al.,  ), and   FIX   (Salimi\u2010Khorshidi et al.,  )\u2014were performed on the same datasets. \n\nAs shown in Figure  , all four preprocessing methods performed the following common steps: First, using the FMRIB Expert Analysis Tool ( ), MATLB2016a, and Bash Shell Scripting, we discarded of the first 10\u2010s of images for magnetic field stabilization; motion correction; slice\u2010time correction; intensity normalization; high\u2010pass temporal filtering (0.0075\u2009Hz) for correcting low\u2010frequency signal drift; and a nonlinear spatial smoothing (using SUSAN; FWHM = 6\u2009mm). Second, for the   conventional   approach, after the remaining volumes were filtered with a band\u2010pass temporal filter (using Butterworth; 0.008\u2009Hz\u2009<\u2009f\u2009<\u20090.1 Hz), regressions were performed using the CSF signal averaged over all voxels of the eroded ventricle region, the averaged WM signal, the averaged global signal of the whole brain, and the six parameters obtained from intra\u2010modal motion correction using MCFLIRT; for   scrub  , motion\u2010volumes were censored by detecting volumes with (a) an FD larger than 0.5\u2009mm, (b) a derivative variance root mean square after Z normalization larger than 2.3, (c)   SD   after Z normalization larger than 2.3, and (d) scrubbing above detected and adjacent symmetric 10\u2010s volumes; for   ICA\u2010AROMA  , after classing and regressing components that represent motion\u2010related artifacts by assessing each component as to whether it exceeded at least one of three criteria: (a) a decision value determined by a linear discriminant analysis that combines brain edge fractions with the maximum correlations with motion\u2010correction parameters, (b) 10% of the CSF fraction, or (c) 35% of the high\u2010frequency content, and regressions were performed using the CSF signal averaged over all voxels of eroded ventricle region, averaged WM signal, averaged global signal of whole brain and the processed image data were filtered with a band\u2010pass temporal filter (using Butterworth; 0.008\u2009Hz\u2009<\u2009f\u2009<\u20090.1 Hz) in the end; for   FIX  , after automatically classifying and regressing out \u201cbad\u201d components by applying the classifier derived from training data based on their spatial and/or temporal features, regression was performed using the averaged global signal of whole brain, and finally, the processed image data were filtered with a band\u2010pass temporal filter (using Butterworth; 0.008\u2009Hz\u2009<\u2009f\u2009<\u20090.1 Hz). Standard.Rdata provided by FSL were fed as trained\u2010weight files for   FIX  \u2010preprocessing of healthy participants. For CBP participants, self\u2010trained\u2010weights files were supplied to   FIX  , where components in 10 subjects randomly selected from the data set were hand classified as either noise or signal components. Twenty was set as the thresholding of good versus bad components for both data sets. \n  \nFlowchart of four preprocessing methods \n  \nAll pre\u2010processed rs\u2010fMRI data were registered to MNI_152_2mm template using FNIRT (ref.  ) for postprocessing. To investigate the effect of the population template on our findings, all data from China were also registered to CN200 template and reanalyzed (Yang et al.,  ). \n\n\n### The effects of the greatest\u2010motion participants on SoFC \n  \nIn this study, we used two approaches (removal or addition of greatest\u2010motion participants) to investigate the effects of greatest\u2010motion participants on SoFC. The first one was to gradually remove the greatest\u2010motion participants from the study group and estimate the regression slope between mFD and SoFD in the remaining participants. The second one was to gradually add greater\u2010motion participants to a given subgroup consisting of less\u2010motion participants and then recalculate the SoFCs within its subgroup. Considering that SoFC is dependent on the size of a given group when individuals are added nonrandomly (i.e., here, the bigger the size of the group, the lower the SoFC in the group due to increased variance), the identical number of participants in the subgroup is necessary for the second approach. To satisfy this requirement, first, based on the value of mFD, either the entire healthy or CBP group was divided into two subgroups: those with greater motion (top 20%) and those with lesser motion (bottom 80%). One participant at a time, we replaced a random lower\u2010motion participant with the participant with the greatest motion. This was repeated until all of the high\u2010motion (top 20%) participants were added. For example, if there are 80 low\u2010motion and 20 high\u2010motion participants, one of the 80 low\u2010motion participants would be randomly replaced by the participant with the greatest motion; next, one randomly selected participant from the 79 remaining low\u2010motion participants would be replaced by the participant with the second\u2010greatest motion; and so on. The SoFC of each participant in the new \u201clesser\u201d motion group was recalculated after a participant was replaced. Finally, only participants in the lesser motion subgroup were extracted and used for further analysis (healthy [101 participants] and CBP [85 participants]). By using this strategy, the effect of gradually adding greater\u2010motion participants (0\u201320%) on the SoFCs of participants with lower motion (60% of lower motion, in that 20% of participants with lower motion would be replaced by greater\u2010motion participants) could be investigated while maintaining identical sample sizes. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nThe Pearson product\u2013moment correlation coefficient was used to quantify the strength of the linear relationship between mFD and SoFC. A negative correlation coefficient with   p   <\u2009.001 represents a statistically significant association between motion and dissimilarity of FC. \n\nA one\u2010way, repeated\u2010measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess that the SoFC differed statistically significantly across different percentage of top\u2010motion participants added. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Pain patients have greater head motion \n  \nCompared with healthy participants, CBP participants had statistically significantly greater head motion during scanning (  t   =\u20099.139,   p   <\u2009.001) (Figure  ), and the association between motion and pain intensity (numerical rating scale, 0\u2013100; 0 =\u2009no pain, 100 = worst pain imaginable) was also statistically significant (  r   =\u2009.178,   p   =\u2009.036) (Figure  ); however, neither the effect of sex (  t   =\u20090.223,   p   =\u2009.823; Figure  ) nor age (  r   =\u2009.035,   p   =\u2009.680; Figure  ) on head motion was statistically significant. In healthy participants, there existed statistically significant difference in head motion between female and male participants (  t   =\u20093.178,   p   =\u2009.002) (Figure  ), and age was statistically significantly correlated with motion (  r   =\u2009.297,   p   <\u2009.001) (Figure  ). \n  \nPain patients have greater head motion. (a) Chronic back pain (CBP) patients have greater motion than healthy participants (  t   =\u20099.139,   p   < .001). For CBP patients, (b) pain intensity (numerical rating scale, 0\u2013100; 0 =\u2009no pain, 100 = worst pain imaginable) was statistically significantly correlated with motion (  r   =\u2009.178,   p   =\u2009.036), but (c) there was no statistically significant difference between male and female (  t   =\u20090.223,   p   =\u2009.823), and (d) age was not statistically significantly correlated with motion (  r   =\u2009.035,   p   =\u2009.680). For healthy participants, (e) there was a statistically significant difference between male and female (  t   =\u20093.178,   p   =\u2009.002), and (f) age was statistically significantly correlated with motion (  r   =\u2009.297,   p   < .001) \n  \n\n### Statistically significant associations between motion and dissimilarity of FC in both healthy and   CBP   participants \n  \nOn a group level, the existence of motion effects after preprocessing was still evident, as indicated by the statistically significant inverse association between motion represented by mFD and SoFC. In healthy participants, as shown in Figure  , this association was observed in all four preprocessing methods (  conventional   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.541],   scrub   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.495],   ICA\u2010AROMA   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.504], and   FIX   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.517] with MNI152 as a template and   conventional   [  r   =\u2009\u2212559],   scrub   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.521],   ICA\u2010AROMA   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.513], and   FIX   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.532]) with CN200 as a template. The population template effect is minor. When the same data analysis procedure was applied to CBP participants with MNI152 as a template, as shown in Figure  , the results were similar (  conventional   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.563],   scrub   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.639],   ICA\u2010AROMA   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.595], and   FIX   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.607]). To ensure the relationship between mFD and SoFC was not confounded by age, we performed partial correlations to assess the relationship between mFD and SoFC independent of age. The results were robust, even after adjusting for age (  r   =\u2009\u2212.489 [  conventional  ],   r   =\u2009\u2212.436 [  scrubbing  ],   r   =\u2009\u2212.437 [  AROMA  ], and   r   =\u2009\u2212.454 [  FIX  ] for healthy participants with MNI152 as a template;   r   =\u2009\u2212.576 [  conventional  ],   r   =\u2009\u2212.650 [  scrubbing  ];   r   =\u2009\u2212.606 [  AROMA  ], and   r   = \u2212.617 [  FIX  ] for CBP participant with MNI152 as a template), which implies that while age is weakly associated with SoFC, it does not share variance with mFD. \n  \nStatistically significant inverse association between mean framewise displacement (mFD) and similarity of functional connectivity (SoFC) in both healthy and chronic back pain (CBP) participants. (a) In healthy participants, a statistically significant negative correlation was observed between mFD and SoFC for all four preprocessing methods (  p   < .001) (  conventional   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.541],   scrub   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.495],   ICA\u2010AROMA   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.504], and   FIX   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.517]). (b) When using the CN200 template for healthy participants, a statistically significant negative correlation was observed between mFD and SoFC for all four preprocessing methods (  p   < .001) (  conventional   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.559],   scrub   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.521],   ICA\u2010AROMA   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.513], and   FIX   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.532]). (c) In CBP participants with MNI152 as the template, a statistically significant negative correlation was observed between mFD and SoFC for all four preprocessing methods (  p   < .001) (  conventional   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.563],   scrub   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.639],   ICA\u2010AROMA   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.595], and   FIX   [  r   =\u2009\u2212.607]) \n  \n\n### SoFC derived from   scrub   is more similar to that from   conventional  , than    ICA\u2010AROMA    or    FIX   \n  \nSoFC derived from   scrub   is more similar to that from   conventional  , than   ICA\u2010AROMA   or   FIX  . As shown in Figure  , for healthy participants, the correlations of SoFC between   scrub   and the three other preprocessing methods (  conventional  ,   ICA\u2010AROMA  , and   FIX  ) were 0.965, 0.772, and 0.812, respectively. The same trend was observed in CBP participants (Figure  ) and the correlations of SoFC between   scrub   and the three other threes (  conventional  ,   ICA\u2010AROMA  , and   FIX  ) were 0.899, 0.882, and 0.755, respectively. In addition, the correlation of SoFC between   ICA\u2010AROMA   and   FIX  \u2010preprocessing was 0.798 (healthy) and 0.759 (CBP). \n  \nCorrelation heatmaps of the similarity of functional connectivity derived from conventional, scrub, ICA\u2010AROMA, and FIX\u2010preprocessing methods. (a) In healthy participants, the correlations of similarity of functional connectivity between   scrub   and the three other preprocessing methods (  conventional  ,   ICA\u2010AROMA  , and   FIX  ) were 0.965, 0.772, and 0.812, respectively. The correlation of similarity of functional connectivity between ICA\u2010AROMA and FIX\u2010preprocessing was 0.798. (b) In CBP participants, the correlations of similarity of functional connectivity between   scrub   and the three other preprocessing methods (  conventional  ,   ICA\u2010AROMA  , and   FIX  ) were 0.899, 0.882, and 0.755, respectively. The correlation of similarity of functional connectivity between   ICA\u2010AROMA   and   FIX  \u2010preprocessing was 0.759 \n  \n\n### Participants with the greatest motion determined the strength of the association between motion and dissimilarity of FC \n  \nFrom the group perspective, there existed statistically significant associations between motion and dissimilarity of FC in both healthy and CBP participants. However, the variance of the association was most from greatest\u2010motion participants. For healthy participants (Figure   solid curves), when the percentage of greatest\u2010motion participants removed was varied from 0 to 20, the slope of the remaining participants gradually changed from \u22120.7367 (  conventional  ), \u22120.7279 (  scrub  ), \u22120.5979 (  ICA\u2010AROMA  ), and \u22120.6194 (  FIX  ) to \u22120.1338 (  conventional  ), \u22120.1376 (  scrub  ), \u22120.1663 (  ICA\u2010AROMA  ), and \u22120.0905 (  FIX  ). For CBP participants (Figure   dotted curves), when the percentage of greatest\u2010motion participants was varied from 0 to 40, the slope of the remaining participants changed from \u22121.0187 (  conventional  ), \u22121.0472 (  scrub  ), \u22121.1288 (  ICA\u2010AROMA  ), and \u22121.0222 (  FIX  ) to \u22120.1584 (  conventional  ), \u22120.1894 (  scrub  ), \u22120.1047 (  ICA\u2010AROMA  ), and \u22120.1509 (  FIX  ). Moreover, the intersections with the line of   mFD threshold   =\u20090.2\u2009mm (see arrows in Figure  ) were critical points for both groups, where the corresponding slope curves became flat from steep significantly (see arrows in Figure  ), indicating the linear relationships between motion and dissimilarity of FC in both healthy and CBP were mostly determined by greatest\u2010motion participants. \n  \nParticipants with the greatest motion determined the strength of the association between motion and dissimilarity of functional connectivity (a) In healthy participants (solid curves), when the percentage of greatest\u2010motion participants removed was varied from 0 to 20, the slope of the remaining participants gradually changed from \u22120.7367 (  conventional  ), \u22120.7279 (  scrub  ), \u22120.5979 (  ICA\u2010AROMA  ), and \u22120.6194 (  FIX  ) to \u22120.1338 (  conventional  ), \u22120.1376 (  scrub  ), \u22120.1663 (  ICA\u2010AROMA  ), and \u22120.0905 (  FIX  ). In chronic back pain (CBP) participants (dotted curves), when the percentage of greatest\u2010motion participants was varied from 0 to 40, the slope of the remaining participants changed from \u22121.0187 (  conventional  ), \u22121.0472 (  scrub  ), \u22121.1288 (  ICA\u2010AROMA  ), and \u22121.0222 (  FIX  ) to \u22120.1584 (  conventional  ), \u22120.1894 (  scrub  ), \u22120.1047 (  ICA\u2010AROMA  ), and \u22120.1509 (  FIX  ). (b) Depicted the relationship between the percentage of the greatest\u2010motion participants removed and the mFD above which the corresponding participants were removed from the study group and the regression slope between mFD and SoFD in the remaining participants were estimated. CBP had higher mFD than healthy at the same percentage. The intersections with the line of   mFD   =\u20090.2\u2009mm (arrows) were critical points for both groups, where the corresponding slope curves (see arrows in (a) became flat from steep significantly). (c) In healthy participants (the top four solid lines), when participants with the greatest motion were gradually added from 0 to 20% to randomly ordered bottom\u2010motion participants, the results of one\u2010way, repeated\u2010measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a statistically significant effect of the percentage on the (  F  (10,100) = 316.7,   F  (10,100) = 353.3,   F  (10,100) = 832.1,   F  (10,100) = 698.7,   p   < .001 for   conventional  ,   scrub  ,   ICA\u2010AROMA  , and   FIX  \u2010preprocessing, respectively). Bonferroni\u2010corrected post hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that each pairwise difference was statistically significant (  p   < .001), suggesting that the similarity of functional connectivity significantly decreased as a function of the percentage of greatest\u2010motion participants added. Similarly, in CBP participants (the bottom four dotted lines), when greatest\u2010motion participants were added gradually from 0 to 20% to randomly ordered lower\u2010motion participants, the results of one\u2010way, repeated\u2010measures ANOVA revealed a statistically significant effect of the percentage on SoFC (  F  (10,84) = 377.1,   F  (10,84) = 802.6,   F  (10,84) = 456.7,   F  (10,84) = 536.1,   p   < .001 for   conventional  ,   scrub  ,   ICA\u2010AROMA  , and   FIX  \u2010preprocessing, respectively). Bonferroni\u2010corrected post hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that each pairwise difference was statistically significant (  p   < .001), suggesting that the similarity of functional connectivity significantly decreased as a function of the percentage of top\u2010motion participants added \n  \n\n### SoFC was statistically significantly increased following removal of top\u2010motion participants \n  \nAs shown in Figure   (the top four solid lines), when the participants with the greatest motion in healthy group were gradually added from 0 to 20% to randomly ordered lower\u2010motion participants, the results of one\u2010way, repeated\u2010measures ANOVA revealed a statistically significant effect of the percentage on the SoFC. (  F  (10,100) = 316.7,   F  (10,100) = 353.3,   F  (10,100) = 832.1,   F  (10,100) = 698.7,   p   < .001 for   conventional  ,   scrub  ,   ICA\u2010AROMA  , and   FIX  \u2010preprocessing, respectively). Bonferroni\u2010corrected post hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that each pairwise difference was statistically significant (  p   < .001), suggesting that the SoFC statistically significantly decreased as a function of the percentage of greater\u2010motion participants added. This phenomenon was observed in CBP group as well (Figure  , the bottom four dotted lines). When greater\u2010motion participants were added gradually from 0% to 20% to randomly ordered lower\u2010motion participants, the effects of the percentage on SoFC were again statistically significant (  F  (10,84) = 377.1,   F  (10,84) = 802.6,   F  (10,84) = 456.7,   F  (10,84) = 536.1,   p   <\u2009.001 for   conventional  ,   scrub  ,   ICA\u2010AROMA  , and   FIX  \u2010preprocessing, respectively). Bonferroni\u2010corrected post hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that each pairwise difference was statistically significant (  p   < .001), suggesting that the SoFC significantly decreased as a function of the percentage of greater\u2010motion participants added. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nHere, we developed and examined a new group\u2010level QC metric to help control for the effects of head motion on FC. We found that (a) pain patients had greater motion and (b) dissimilarity of FC uncovers the influence of participant's motion. Importantly, this relationship is independent of population, scanner, and preprocessing method. Participants with the greatest motion determined the strength of the association between motion and dissimilarity of FC. \n\nAlthough it is commonly assumed that participants with CBP have elevated motion accompanied with statistically significantly greater confounds than healthy participants, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to quantify the effects of head motion and pain intensity. The results shown in Figure   indicate that pain or pain\u2010related disorders, like anxiety (de Heer et al.,  ), influence head motion in CBP patients, which was substantial enough that it seems to dwarf the sex and age effects on motion that existed in healthy participants. Considering that motion caused by pain or the pain\u2010related discomfort has a large influence, it is necessary to take preventive strategies; for instance, shortening the duration of scanning sessions, taking a break before fMRI scanning, paying more attention and reminding the patients to remain still during scanning, or even training with a mock MRI to reduce anxiety before scanning (Zaitsev, Maclaren et al.  ). \n\nThe dissimilarity of FC due to motion represents the dissimilarity of each participant's FC relative to the rest in sample, indicating motion\u2010induced BOLD signals increase the distinctiveness of individuals relative to the rest of their sample. At the voxel level, disruption caused by motion decreases the BOLD signal and the magnitude of the signal loss is associated with the extent of motion (Satterthwaite et al.,  ). In addition, more studies indicate that head motion can be a neurobiological trait, contributing to the dissimilarity of FC in the region of default\u2010mode network (Zeng et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ). Thus, preprocessing methods for removing motion\u2010related artifacts improve fMRI data quality without necessarily totally correcting the data (Power et al.,  ). At the ROI level, except for those voxels that share disruption produced by motion, the BOLD signal of an ROI extracted as an average over its constituent voxels is diminished because the disruption could extend for tens of seconds and distort hemodynamic response across voxels, even after motion correction (Byrge & Kennedy,  ; Power et al.,  ), in turn introducing spurious common variance across time points from different regions (Caballero\u2010Gaudes & Reynolds,  ). As a result, at the participant level, the strength of FC, calculated using Pearson correlation coefficients between ROI BOLD signals, decreases accordingly, except for ROIs that are (a) close and prone to motion, or (b) are distant but with similar motion artifacts (Power et al.,  ). In the end, this disruption due to motion is amplified by dissimilarity of FC at group level, which is evidenced by Figure  , and independent of participant population, scanner type, or preprocessing method. The observation that dissimilarity of FC reflects the effect of a participant's motion at the group level reemphasizes the impairment of motion to quality of fMRI data even though the data has been preprocessed at participant level. Such findings indicate the necessity of other motion\u2010removal methods, like prospective motion correction (Hoinkiss et al.,  ; Todd, Josephs, Callaghan, Lutti, & Weiskopf,  ; Zaitsev et al.,  ) or multiecho imaging techniques (Power et al.,  ). \n\nBy selecting a suitable percentage of participants with greater motion (e.g., the percentage corresponding to line of mFD = 0.2\u2009mm shown in Figure  ), the slope of the correlation between mFD and dissimilarity of FC in the remaining participants decreases substantially for both groups. This characteristic implies that there may exist multiple sources of motion\u2010related noise after preprocessing. The participants with lower motion (mFD \u22640.2\u2009mm in our data) may contain similar noise structure, increasing the similarity in FC. Concurrently, the confounds present in the participants with high motion are qualitatively different from those in low\u2010motion participants, indicating similarity will always be lower for high\u2010motion participants because high\u2010motion has produced their unique noise signatures, irrespective of what preprocessing method is deployed. Incorporating the results shown in Figure   that the SoFC increased as a function of the participants removed, for fMRI studies that contain large\u2010scale images of participants and in which sample size is not a considerable concern, like the UK Biobank (Alfaro\u2010Almagro et al.,  ) or German National Cohort (German National Cohort,  ), the greatest\u2010motion participants, which account for the greatest effect on FC, can be removed from the group. We suggest that if a group data set is large enough, participants with large motion in the data set be removed to make the regression slope between mean FD and SoFC as flat as possible. \n\nOne limitation of our study was the different TRs between groups, which made it difficult to directly compare FD measures. Moreover, the long TR time in the control group precluded assessments of subtle variations in head motion. In the future, we will systematically investigate how preprocessing methods affect SoFC and how distance\u2010 and location\u2010distributions of FC vary and interact with SoFC as higher\u2010motion participants are removed. \n\nIn conclusion, we found that dissimilarity of FC uncovers the influence of participant's motion, and this relationship is independent of population, scanner, and preprocessing method. Participants with the greatest motion determined the strength of the association between motion and dissimilarity of FC. A new group\u2010based QC strategy is proposed: if a group data set is large enough, participants with large motion in the data set be removed to make the regression slope between mean FD and SoFC as flat as possible. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7814752, "text_md5": "9f00cf64f06deef0782c3de7a5368070", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 157], "journal": [158, 172], "publication_year": [174, 178], "title": [189, 325], "keywords": [339, 414], "abstract": [427, 2323], "body": [2332, 37866]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 33079467, "doi": "10.1002/hbm.25255", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7814752", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7814752"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7814752\">7814752</a>", "list_title": "PMC7814752  Dissimilarity of functional connectivity uncovers the influence of participant's motion in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies"}
