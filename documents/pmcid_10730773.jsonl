Yet, little is known about the extent to which early within- and between-network amygdala FC are related to infant stress recovery across the first year of life. In this study, we examined associations between amygdala FC (i.e., within-network amygdala connectivity, and between-network amygdala connectivity with the DMN and SAL) at 3 months and infant recovery from a mild social stressor at 3, 6 and 9 months. At 3 months, thirty-five infants (13 girls) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging during natural sleep. Infants and their mothers completed the still-face paradigm at 3, 6, and 9 months, and infant stress recovery was assessed at each time point as the proportion of infant social engagement during the reunion episode. Bivariate correlations indicated that greater positive within-network amygdala FC and greater positive amygdala-SAL FC, but not amygdala-DMN FC, at 3 months predicted lower levels of stress recovery at 3 and 6 months, but were nonsignificant at 9 months. These findings provide preliminary evidence that early functional synchronization within the amygdala network, as well as segregation between the amygdala and the SAL, may contribute to infant stress recovery in the context of infant\u2013mother interaction. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nInfants are exposed to mild social stressors (e.g., temporary unavailability of caregivers) in daily life, and the ability to recover from such stressors and resume engagement is important in maintaining homeostasis and repairing disrupted social interactions ( ). Over the first year of life, infants learn to regulate stress through infant\u2013mother interaction ( ;  ), and early experiences of successful stress recovery are posited to accumulate into regulatory resilience( ) and contribute to subsequent adaptive socioemotional functioning, including higher social competence and fewer behavioral problems (e.g.,  ;  ). Because mothers play a key role in infant stress regulation, an infant\u2019s ability to recover from a moderate stressor has been operationalized as the infant\u2019s social engagement with the mother following the stressor (e.g.,  ;  ). \n\nDespite its importance, the neural mechanisms underlying infant stress recovery in the context of infant-mother interaction remain unknown. The amygdala and its adjacent subcortical areas, including the caudate, putamen, and thalamus, are key nodes of a bottom-up emotional appraisal network that is essential to stress regulation ( ;  ;  ;  ). For instance, among healthy adults, stress induction tasks temporarily enhance positive connectivity between the amygdala and dorsal striatum (i.e., the caudate and putamen;  ). Further, positive resting-state functional connectivity (FC) between the amygdala and its adjacent subcortical areas has been observed among neonates ( ), paralleling resting-state FC patterns observed in healthy adults ( ), suggesting within-network amygdala connectivity exists at birth. Among very preterm children (<33 weeks gestation), more positive amygdala FC with the right thalamus during the neonatal period predicts higher levels of parent-reported negative affectivity in early childhood ( ). These findings suggest that within-network amygdala FC may be involved in reflexive behaviors (e.g., crying) in response to stress. \n\nAs a key node in the human brain, the amygdala also functions in coordination with other networks of the \u201csocial brain\u201d in adults ( ) to promote stress recovery in the context of social interaction ( ). First, the default-mode network (DMN) is important for both allostasis and processing of social information ( ). Among adults, the DMN integrates ventral medial prefrontal, posterior cingulate, inferior lateral parietal, and medial/lateral temporal regions to support self-referential processing (e.g., reflection on one\u2019s own emotional states;  ). One longitudinal study showed that amygdala-DMN FC was negative in neonates, became positive during the first year, and decreased during the second year ( ), suggesting the dynamic nature of early between-network interaction. These authors further found that decreases in amygdala-DMN FC during the second year, but not connectivity or changes in the first year, predicted lower levels of caregiver-reported child anxiety at 4 years. Interestingly, findings from other studies linking amygdala-DMN FC during the first three months to parental reports of child socioemotional functioning showed associations in opposite directions.   reported that more negative neonatal amygdala FC with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a key region of the DMN, predicted more internalizing problems at 2 years. In contrast, more negative amygdala FC with other DMN regions (i.e., precuneus, right angular gyrus) during the first three months was linked concurrently to more infant smiling at 3 months ( ) and less negative affectivity at 4\u20137 years ( ). These findings, albeit inconsistent, highlight the importance of the amygdala-DMN interactions in early socioemotional outcomes. \n\nSecond, as the other core network in the \u201csocial brain\u201d in adults, the salience network (SAL) centers on the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex and supports the integration of internal and external information to detect salient stimuli and allocate attention ( ). Amygdala-SAL FC demonstrates substantial maturation during the first year ( ). Among 3-month-old infants, weaker positive amygdala-SAL FC was concurrently related to more infant smiling as reported by parents ( ). Using an observational measure of infant affect,   similarly reported that weaker positive amygdala FC with the anterior cingulate cortex at 4 months was concurrently associated with more positive affect in response to novelty. Among studies linking amygdala-SAL FC to later child adjustment, stronger positive amygdala FC with SAL regions at 4 weeks of age predicted higher levels of maternal reports of infant fear at 6 months ( ;  ) and depressive and anxiety symptoms at 2 years ( ). These findings suggest that negative emotions and stressors may be perceived as more salient for infants who display stronger positive amygdala-SAL FC, which may hinder infants\u2019 ability to cope with stress. \n\nPrior studies of infant amygdala FC and social functioning have largely measured infant behavioral outcomes at a single time point (see   for an exception), yet socioemotional skills (e.g., stress regulation) develop rapidly during the first year ( ;  ;  ). Before three months of age, infants mainly rely on their caregivers to regulate stress due to rudimentary behavioral and neurophysiological repertoires. From three to six months, infants start to actively elicit assistance from caregivers when they are distressed. During the second half of the first year, with the emergence of intentionality and joint attention, infants are able to leverage caregivers\u2019 help by selecting and altering interactive behaviors until their emotional needs are met. In light of these developmental changes, studies assessing infant stress recovery at multiple time points across the first year are needed to understand the contributions of amygdala functional architecture in predicting infant stress recovery. In addition, prior studies linking amygdala FC to infant behavioral outcomes have mainly relied on caregiver reports (see   for an exception). However, compared with caregiver reports, behavioral observations may provide more objective and precise assessments of infant socioemotional functioning. \n\nWe conducted a preliminary investigation on the associations between amygdala FC at 3 months and infant recovery from a social stressor observed at 3, 6, and 9 months. To assess stress recovery, we used the still-face paradigm (SFP;  ), which involves three episodes: play, still-face, and reunion. The still-face episode, in which the mother pauses interacting with the infant, typically elicits an infant distress response ( ). The extent to which the infant socially re-engages with the mother in the reunion reflects the infant\u2019s ability to regulate stress in the context of infant\u2013mother interaction. We hypothesized that greater within-network amygdala FC at 3 months, reflecting greater reliance on reflexive stress responses ( ;  ), would be associated with less infant social engagement during the reunion. Regarding between-network connectivity, we hypothesized that greater positive amygdala-SAL FC at 3 months, reflecting greater tendency to perceive stressors as emotionally salient ( ;  ), would be associated with less infant social engagement during the reunion. Given the inconsistent findings for amygdala-DMN FC ( ;  ;  ), its association with social engagement was exploratory. Little is known about the extent to which early amygdala connectivity is related to stress recovery at different ages within the first year and, therefore, we did not have a priori hypotheses about differences in the magnitude of associations between amygdala FC at 3 months and infant stress recovery at 3, 6, and 9 months. Lastly, we examined whether amygdala FC was more relevant for stress recovery versus overall social engagement, operationalized as infant social engagement during the play episode of the SFP. Given the involvement of amygdala in more emotionally challenging contexts ( ), we hypothesized that amygdala FC would be more strongly related to social engagement during the reunion compared with the play episode. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nOne hundred and eighteen infant\u2013mother dyads participated in a longitudinal study of infant socioemotional development during the first year. Families were recruited from pediatric clinics and community organizations located in a midsized midwestern city in the United States, as well as online forums serving local families with young children. Exclusion criteria include premature birth (<37 weeks gestation) and any cardiac abnormalities, serious birth complications, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contraindications. After March 2020, neural data collection was suspended, and behavioral data were collected using a virtual visit protocol (see  ), due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the 118 families, 95 families enrolled when their infant was 3 months of age. Of the 29 infants participating at the 3-month time point but not scanned, scans were not attempted due to COVID-19 restrictions (  n   = 13), parents opting out of the scan visit (  n   = 4), or failure of the infant to fall asleep during the scan visit (  n   = 12). Among the 66 infants who were scanned at 3 months, 31 infants were excluded due to incomplete scans (  n   = 24), excessive motion and/or artifacts (  n   = 3), or not having enough volumes left after preprocessing (  n   = 4).   T  -tests for independent samples revealed that the successful acquisition of neural data was not related to infant age, sex, maternal race, education, family income, or infant social engagement in the reunion episode of the SFP. Thus, the sample for this report consists of 35 infants (13 girls; see   for descriptive statistics for infant age). Among this subsample, mothers were 10% Black or African American, 84% White non-Hispanic, 3% Hispanic, and 3% another race or more than one race (did not specify). Twenty-six percent of mothers had an advanced degree, 45% had a bachelor\u2019s degree, 23% had some college or a degree from technical school, and 6% had a high school degree. Twenty-three percent of mothers reported annual family income between $10,000 and $30,000, 30% between $31,000 and $60,000, 17% between $71,000 and $90,000, and 30% above $90,000. \n\n\n### Procedure overview \n  \nInfant\u2013mother dyads completed a behavioral session at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, during which a series of behavioral tasks were conducted and video-recorded. Data from the SFP ( ) at 3, 6, and 9 months were examined for this report. We have previously reported that the virtual SFP assessments were comparable to lab SFP assessments in terms of inter-observer reliability and construct validity (e.g., same pattern of change in infant behavior across the SFP episodes; see  ). Infants also completed an MRI scan at 3 months. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \n\n\n### Measures \n  \n#### Infant behaviors during the SFP \n  \nThe SFP was micro-coded for infant behaviors by trained coders using Datavyu ( ), which allows for onset/offset coding of behaviors in real time and segmenting continuous codes by frame (33 ms/frame). Behavioral codes were adapted from existing coding systems ( ;  ;  ). Infant facial expressions, vocalizations, and gaze were used for this report (see  ). Overall, 20%\u201325% of SFP protocols were double-coded throughout the coding process. Inter-observer reliability, assessed with Cohen\u2019s kappa, was acceptable for facial expressions (0.75, 0.70, 0.74, for 3, 6, and 9 months, respectively), vocalizations (0.77, 0.82, 0.80), and gaze (0.75, 0.81, 0.77). \n\nInfant facial expressions, vocalizations, and gaze were integrated into affective engagement states, adapted from the Infant and Caregiver Engagement Phases system (see  ). The infant engagement states include (a) negative engagement, (b) environment engagement, (c) activity engagement, (d) social monitoring, and (e) positive engagement (see  ). From these infant engagement states, we computed the proportion of   infant social engagement   during the play and reunion episode, respectively, at each time point by dividing the total number of frames where infants showed one of the three positive or neutral engagement states (i.e., activity engagement + social monitoring + positive engagement) by the total number of frames. Frames that were coded as missing for infant engagement states due to not visible or unalert facial expressions (3.2% missingness) were excluded from these calculations. \n\nGiven that stress recovery is dependent on the level of stress elicited by the task, we also measured the extent to which the infant exhibited distress during the still-face episode at each time point and examined this variable as a potential covariate. To compute   infant distress   at a given time point, we divided the total number of frames where the infant showed negative facial and/or vocal affect by the total number of frames. Frames coded as missing for infant engagement states during the still-face episode (3.6% missingness) were excluded from these calculations. \n\n\n#### Demographics and maternal depressive symptoms \n  \nMothers reported on family demographics (i.e., infant date of birth and sex, maternal education and race, and family income). Mothers also completed a series of surveys, including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D,  ), at each time point. The CES-D consists of 20 items rated on a four-point scale, ranging from 0 (  rarely or none of the time  ) to 3 (  most or all of the time  ). For this report, we examined the continuous score for maternal depressive symptoms at the 3-month visit (  M   = 8.80,   SD   = 8.10). Ratings showed good internal consistency (  \u03b1   = 0.88). A score equal to or above 16 indicates mild to significant depressive symptoms. Comparable to the pooled prevalence of maternal postpartum depression in developed countries of 12% (see  , for a meta-analysis), 13% of mothers reported mild to significant depressive symptoms in the current sample. \n\n\n#### Neuroimaging data acquisition \n  \nAt the 3-month visit, dyads visited the university\u2019s biomedical imaging center at the infant\u2019s regular naptime or bedtime. Safety screenings were conducted by trained staff at recruitment and again immediately prior to the scan session. Within the scan room, an enclosed MRI-compliant booth furnished with a glider provided the mothers with a quiet place to feed and/or rock their infants to sleep. To minimize the chance of the scanner waking the infant, lights were dimmed in the scanner area, and white noise was played continuously in the scan room. Once the infant was asleep, several layers of ear protection were applied (e.g., soft moldable silicone ear plugs, infant-sized muffs around the ears, a second pair of adult-sized headphone inserts over the muffs, additional padding applied around the ears). The infant was placed in a custom-made holder that stabilized the infant\u2019s body and head, minimizing significant motion. The holder maintained the infant\u2019s position, and a trained staff member monitored the infant throughout the scan session. Mothers had the choice of observing the scan from the control room or remaining with their infant in the scan room if they passed the safety screening. \n\nInfant MRI sequences, including resting state functional MRI (11 min, 22 s), 3D high resolution (0.8 mm isotropic) T1-weighted (6 min, 38 s) and T2-weighted volumes (5 min, 57 s), and diffusion weighted imaging (8 min, 26 s), were acquired on a Siemens 3 Tesla Prisma scanner with a 64-channel head/neck coil during natural sleep. The imaging protocol was matched with the Baby Connectome Project at UNC ( ). Utilizing the simultaneous multi-slice sequence ( ;  ;  ), infant resting state functional MRI data was acquired (voxel size = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm , whole brain coverage, TE = 37 ms, simultaneous multi-slice multiband factor (MB) = 8, 840 volumes, TR = 800 ms). \n\n\n#### Neuroimaging data analysis \n  \nFMRIB\u2019s Software Library (FSL;  ) and analysis of functional neuroimages (AFNI;  ) were used to preprocess functional imaging data. Rigid-body motion correction, registration, bandpass filtering (0.01\u20130.08 Hz), scrubbing, nuisance signal regression, and global signal regression were included in preprocessing steps. The first frame of functional image served as the target image for motion correction. The 6 motion parameters (displacements and rotations) were used to estimate frame-wise displacement (FD). The neonate-specific template ( ) served as the target image. Each subject was visually checked to make sure that qualified registration was performed. The entire functional datasets were aligned to the template space using per-volume transformations; rigid-body within functional plus nonlinear distortion correction plus spatial normalization: nonlinear functional-to-anatomical and nonlinear anatomical-to-standard. Both nonlinear registrations for spatial normalization used advanced normalization tools (ANTs;  ). Specifically, spatial normalization was performed with ANTs with neonatal infant atlas as the target space. We first estimated transforms from functional space to structural T2 space, then from T2 to template neonatal space. Data scrubbing was performed as an additional motion correction step other than the standard rigid-body motion correction steps; volumes with FD higher than 0.5 mm were removed (\u201cscrubbed\u201d) from the original data. If only one or two volumes were left between any two scrubbed volumes, they were also removed for strict scrubbing ( ). The number of scrubbed volumes for each participant ranged from 1 to 522 volumes, with a median of 25 volumes. Participants (  n   = 4) with <235 volumes remaining (3.133 min) were excluded from further analysis. For nuisance signal regression, the model included 32 parameters (32P); eight regressors corresponding to white matter (WM) and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) signals, as well as the six motion estimates, plus their derivative, quadratic, and squared derivative terms ( ). The data were then warped to the standard neonatal space, spatially smoothed via a Gaussian kernel of 6-mm full width at half maximum. Lastly, we performed global signal regression to regress out the mean gray matter (GM) signal from the preprocessed data. \n\nAfter preprocessing, the network maps for amygdala network, DMN, and SAL were obtained using AFNI and MATLAB. Specifically, seeds in the amygdala and anterior insula (for SAL) were defined based on corresponding bilateral regions in the automated anatomical atlas (AAL) template ( ), whereas PCC (for DMN) was defined as a sphere region of 8-mm radius centered on the local PCC maximum of the canonical DMN map derived in  ; see   for depiction of the seed regions). Subsequently, seed-based FC maps were calculated for each ROI and each subject based on Pearson\u2019s Correlation, and group-level significant network maps were derived using one-sample t-tests across all subjects with cluster-size correction (voxel-wise   p   < 0.001, cluster-size correction   \u03b1   < 0.05,   t   > 0). After that, within-network FC value was defined as the average seed-based FC value masked by the corresponding group-level network map; the between-network FC value (e.g., between network A and network B) was defined as the mean value of average seed-based FC value in one network map (e.g., network A/B) masked by the other network mask (e.g., network B/A). \n\n\n#### Brain-behavior analyses \n  \nTo test associations between infant amygdala FC at 3 months and social engagement during the reunion episode at 3, 6, and 9 months, we conducted Pearson\u2019s correlations in SPSS 28.0. Infant social engagement during the reunion episode was missing due to infant distress or distraction during the SFP (  n  s = 3, 1, and 2, for 3, 6, and 9 months, respectively), equipment failure (  n  s = 1 and 1, for 3 and 9 months, respectively), or loss to follow-up (  n  s = 2 and 3, for 6 and 9 months, respectively; see   for sample sizes at each time point). To account for any potential covariate (i.e., the number of scrubbed volumes, infant age, sex, maternal education and depressive symptoms, family income, and infant distress during the still-face episode) that was significantly associated with both amygdala FC and social engagement, partial correlations were tested. For the main correlational analyses (FC [3] \u00d7 infant social engagement at each time point [3] = 9 tests), we applied a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (  p   < 0.006). Given the modest sample size, we conducted additional bootstrapped analyses by resampling 5000 times to estimate bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) confidence intervals for the correlation coefficients ( ;  ). To further examine whether amygdala FC was more relevant for stress recovery versus overall social engagement, we ran supplemental analyses comparing the correlations between amygdala FC and infant social engagement during the reunion versus play episode of the SFP. \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Preliminary analyses \n  \nGroup-level FC maps of infants\u2019 amygdala network, DMN and SAL at 3 months are shown in  . The amygdala map included bilateral amygdala and adjacent subcortical regions. The DMN map encompassed most of the critical nodes observed among adults, including the PCC, bilateral angular gyrus, hippocampus, and lateral temporal cortices, but the medial prefrontal connection was not present. The SAL map included the bilateral insula, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortices. All three maps are consistent with previous findings ( ). To note, although the SAL and amygdala maps over-lapped to some extent, there were discernable differences in that the SAL network covered the anterior insula and anterior cingulate/medial prefrontal regions more substantially, whereas the amygdala network extended to subcortical regions. These patterns are in line with prior literature that considers the SAL and amygdala networks as separate entities that closely interact with each other ( ). \n\nDescriptive statistics for the study variables are reported in  . Tests of potential covariates (i.e., six independent sample   t  -tests for infant sex and 42 bivariate correlations for other covariates) showed that (a) older infants exhibited more social engagement during the reunion at the 3-month visit (  r   = 0.36,   p   = 0.048), (b) more infant distress during the still-face was related to less social engagement during the reunion: 3-month (  r   = \u22120.52,   p   = 0.003), 6-month (  r   = \u22120.38,   p   = 0.03), 9-month (  r   = \u22120.39,   p   = 0.04), and (c) infant distress at 6 months was related to more positive within-network amygdala FC (  r   = 0.38,   p   = 0.03) and more positive amygdala-SAL FC (  r   = 0.42,   p   = 0.02) at 3 months. No other associations between covariates and the main study variables emerged. Given that infant distress at 6 months was related to both infant social engagement during the reunion at 6 months and amygdala FC at 3 months, we also tested partial correlations controlling for infant distress at 6 months. \n\n\n### Amygdala FC and social engagement following a stressor \n  \nConsistent with our hypotheses, bivariate correlations (see  ) showed that greater positive within-network amygdala FC at 3 months predicted less infant social engagement during the reunion at 3 and 6 months. Similarly, greater positive amygdala-SAL FC at 3 months predicted less infant social engagement during the reunion at 3 and 6 months. These associations were nonsignificant at 9 months (  rs   = 0.14 and .09,   ps   = 0.48 and 0.64, BCa 95%CIs are [\u22120.24, 0.50] and [\u22120.28, 0.45], for within-network amygdala FC and amygdala-SAL FC, respectively), and associations with social engagement at 6 months (but not 3 months) survived the correction for multiple comparisons (i.e.,   p   < 0.006). No significant associations emerged between amygdala-DMN FC and infant social engagement at 3, 6, or 9 months (see   for correlations for 3 and 6 months; 9 months:   r   = \u22120.22,   p   = 0.26, BCa 95%CI [\u22120.52, 0.12]). To follow up the significant bivariate associations at 6 months, we tested partial correlations controlling for infant distress during the still-face episode at 6 months, and associations remained significant; stronger within-network amygdala FC (  r   = \u22120.44,   p   = 0.014, BCa 95%CI [\u22120.68, \u22120.18]), as well as stronger amygdala-SAL FC (  r   = \u22120.41,   p   = 0.023, BCa 95%CI [\u22120.67, \u22120.12]), were related to less infant social engagement during the reunion at 6 months. \n\nSensitivity analyses were also conducted. Specifically, we tested partial correlations controlling for the number of scrubbed volumes, infant sex, and infant age at the behavioral or neural session (see  ). The partial correlations showed the same pattern of findings as reported in the main analyses above. \n\n\n### Supplementary analyses \n  \nTo examine whether associations were specific to social engagement following a stressor (i.e., stress recovery) versus social engagement more generally, we compared the correlations between amygdala FC and infant social engagement during the SFP reunion versus SFP play episode at 6 months. Neither within-network amygdala FC (  r   = \u22120.11,   p   = 0.55, BCa 95%CI [\u22120.40, 0.21]) nor amygdala-SAL FC (  r   = \u22120.10,   p   = 0.61, BCa 95%CI [\u22120.38, 0.21]) was associated with social engagement during the SFP play episode. Tests of the difference between two dependent correlations with one variable in common ( ;  ) showed that the negative associations between amygdala FC and social engagement were stronger for the reunion versus play episode (  z   = 2.39,   p   = 0.008 for within-network amygdala FC;   z   = 2.37,   p   = 0.009 for amygdala-SAL FC). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nDespite the critical role of the amygdala and its interaction with \u201csocial brain\u201d networks in stress regulation among adults ( ;  ), no prior study has linked early amygdala functional architecture to infant stress recovery in a social context. In this study, we examined the associations between amygdala FC (i.e., within-network connectivity and between-network connectivity with the DMN and SAL) at 3 months and infant stress recovery during infant\u2013mother interaction (i.e., social engagement following a stressor) observed at 3, 6, and 9 months. Specifically, greater positive within-network amygdala connectivity and greater positive amygdala-SAL connectivity at 3 months, respectively, predicted less infant social engagement following a stressor at 6 months. These associations also emerged with infant social engagement following a stressor at 3 months but were nonsignificant at 9 months. Amygdala-DMN connectivity did not show associations with stress recovery at any time point. Taken together, the findings offer preliminary evidence of the neural basis of infant stress regulation. \n\nConsistent with prior studies on the development of amygdala FC ( ;  ), we observed positive within-network amygdala FC (i.e., synchronization between amygdala and nearby subcortical regions) at 3 months. The amygdala and its adjacent subcortical areas, including the caudate, putamen, and thalamus, are among the areas that develop earliest in the human brain ( ). As a primary threat detection network, early connectivity within this network may underpin infants\u2019 emotional responses (e.g., crying) to threatening stimuli (e.g., hunger, loud sound). Linking within-network amygdala FC to infant stress recovery, we found that greater within-network amygdala connectivity at 3 months predicted less infant social engagement following a stressor at 3 and 6 months. This result is in line with   finding that stronger neonatal amygdala FC with the thalamus predicted higher levels of negative affectivity during childhood. In healthy adults, thalamic connections with the amygdala send sensory information to the amygdala ( ), and when a threat is detected, the amygdala orchestrates a reallocation of neural resources, mediated by the dorsal striatum (i.e., the caudate and putamen), to facilitate an automatic and quick response at the expense of controlled and flexible behavior ( ;  ). Similarly, stronger within-network amygdala connectivity early in infancy may underlie more reflexive and rudimentary behaviors (e.g., crying, looking away) in response to a moderate stressor, such as an unexpected disruption in social interaction. This interpretation is further supported by our preliminary analyses indicating that greater within-network amygdala FC at 3 months was related to more infant distress during the still-face episode at 6 months. Even when the stressor is removed (i.e., the mother resumes interaction with the infant), the infant\u2019s distress response may continue, thereby overriding or dampening the infant\u2019s ability to show more flexible regulatory behavior (e.g., re-engaging with the mother). \n\nRegarding between-network amygdala connectivity with the SAL, we observed positive amygdala-SAL FC at 3 months, which is consistent with the pattern documented in infants ( ) and adults ( ;  ). Regarding SAL ( ,  ), its positive connectivity with the amygdala may emerge early to support the infant\u2019s vigilance in perceiving and responding to stressors. Further, weaker amygdala-SAL connectivity at 3 months predicted more infant social engagement following a stressor at 3 and 6 months, which is consistent with studies showing concurrent associations between weaker amygdala-SAL connectivity and more positive affective displays during infancy ( ;  ). Our finding extends this prior literature on early amygdala-SAL connectivity to include implications for infant stress recovery in a social context and indicates benefits of loose coupling of the amygdala and SAL for subsequent socioemotional functioning. Although strong positive amygdala-SAL connectivity early in infancy may increase the chance of survival by enabling infants to detect stressors as emotionally salient, the greater tendency to allocate neural resources for threat detection may make these infants less sensitive to positive social cues and less likely to engage in social interaction following a stressor. \n\nWe also examined amygdala connectivity with the DMN and observed negative amygdala FC with the DMN at 3 months, in line with the pattern reported in other infant studies ( ;  ). To note, although amygdala-DMN connectivity also tends to be negative among adults ( ), a change from negative to positive connectivity during the first year was observed in a prior study ( ), highlighting the early development of functional organization between the amygdala and DMN as dynamic and nonlinear. Further, the associations between amygdala-DMN FC at 3 months and stress recovery at 3, 6, and 9 months did not emerge. These null findings and the mixed patterns observed in prior literature ( ;  ;  ) may be partly due to the immaturity of the DMN and its connectivity patterns at 3 months. The DMN typically experiences substantial growth and becomes adult-like toward the end of the first year ( ,  ). Connectivity between the DMN and amygdala later in infancy, therefore, may contribute to socioemotional functioning ( ). \n\nInterestingly, although the associations between amygdala FC and stress recovery emerged concurrently at 3 months, only the prospective predictions for stress recovery at 6 months survived the multiple-comparison correction. In general, this pattern might suggest that early network functional structure provides a neural basis that precedes the emergence of relevant behaviors (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). Specific to infant stress recovery during infant\u2013mother interaction, the brain-behavior association may be strengthened through cumulative experience of successful stress regulation with the mother\u2019s support from 3 to 6 months. Additionally, early neural functional architecture may predict more social engagement following a stressor at 6 months, a point in development when infants are playing a more active role in achieving their regulatory goals ( ;  ). This difference in the strength of the associations between 3 and 6 months, however, should be interpreted with caution given our very modest sample size. \n\nMoreover, we did not observe significant associations between amygdala FC at 3 months and stress recovery at 9 months. The first year is the most dynamic stage of postnatal brain development, especially for higher-order neural networks (i.e., the DMN and SAL;  ,  ), and it is highly likely that continued development of amygdala connectivity after 3 months contributes more to stress regulation observed toward the end of the first year. Substantial nonlinear changes in amygdala FC have been observed during infancy ( ), so it is reasonable that these changes interact with infant growth in other domains (e.g., emotion and attention) over time and jointly contribute to infants\u2019 ability to engage with their mothers following a stressor. Another possible explanation is that amygdala FC with other brain regions may start to play a more salient role in infants stress recovery at 9 months. For example, long-range connections with medial prefrontal regions, which provide top-down neural support for more flexible interactive behaviors ( ), do not emerge until the second half of the first year ( ;  ). Early amygdala functioning (e.g., connectivity with other networks) is posited to play a key role in shaping future amygdala-prefrontal cortex function and emotional development ( ). Taken together, developmental processes within the brain as well as brain-behavior relationships are likely dynamic during infancy and early childhood, and different connections or networks may be fluidly dis/engaged for experience-dependent socioemotional development throughout the process. \n\nIn follow-up analyses, we found that the associations between amygdala FC and social engagement at 6 months were stronger for the reunion versus play episode, suggesting that amygdala functional architecture may be implicated specifically in stress-induced social behaviors versus social engagement in general. As an emotion-processing center ( ;  ), it is reasonable that the amygdala and its interactions with other networks are more involved in emotionally challenging contexts. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing brain-behavior associations in different social contexts to understand the regional specificity of neural functioning. \n\nThe current study has several limitations. First, although comparable to prior studies examining infant brain-behavior associations (e.g.,  ;  ), the sample size was small due to missing scan data and COVID-related interruptions in neural data collection. Therefore, the observed associations between infant amygdala FC and stress recovery should be interpreted as preliminary evidence to guide future studies with larger samples. Although the current sample tended to be representative of the local community in terms of family income and maternal mental health, mothers were pre-dominantly White and well-educated. Thus, replication in other family contexts is needed, although the fact that the successful acquisition of the neural data was not related to demographic characteristics or infant behavioral outcomes minimizes concerns of selection bias. Second, sleeping stages may have significant impacts on the estimated FC ( ), but monitoring sleep stages in the infant population using electrophysiological techniques remains challenging ( ) and was not conducted in this study. Future efforts are needed to develop more infant-friendly monitoring techniques to address this important confounding factor. Third, the measurement of social engagement following a stressor provided a developmentally appropriate measure of infant stress recovery ( ;  ), yet we are cautious in generalizing the findings to infant stress regulation more generally. Future studies measuring stress regulatory behaviors in other contexts (e.g., naturalistic settings;  ) are needed. Fourth, neural data were only collected at 3 months, which limits our ability to elucidate the direction of brain-behavior associations. Repeated neural and behavioral measures across multiple time points are required to understand the continuity and changes in these bidirectional relations. \n\nThis study is the first longitudinal investigation of associations between early amygdala functional architecture and concurrent and subsequent infant stress recovery. Utilizing repeated observational measures of infant social engagement following a stressor, our findings suggest that connectivity within the amygdala network and between the amygdala and SAL at 3 months may contribute to the subsequent ability to recover from social stressors. Stress regulation plays a central role in socioemotional development during infancy and early childhood, and our findings contribute to the identification of early neural markers of infants\u2019 stress regulation in the context of infant-mother interaction. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10730773, "text_md5": "fb07009f0235a4bf7285aecab8c8b246", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 122], "journal": [123, 130], "publication_year": [132, 136], "title": [147, 279], "keywords": [293, 408], "abstract": [421, 1967], "body": [1976, 39172]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 37340633, "doi": "10.1111/desc.13418", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10730773", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10730773"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10730773\">10730773</a>", "list_title": "PMC10730773  Associations between infant amygdala functional connectivity and social engagement following a stressor: A preliminary investigation"}
