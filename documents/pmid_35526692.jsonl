This study proposes a taxonomy of episodic memory formation to address this need. At the broadest level, the taxonomy distinguishes between attention-driven vs. significance-driven memory formation. The three subtypes of attention-driven memory formation are selection-, fluctuation-, and level-related. The three subtypes of significance-driven memory formation are novelty-, emotion-, and reward-related. Meta-analytic data indicated that attention-driven memory formation affects the functioning of the extra-medial temporal lobe more strongly than the medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions. In contrast, significance-driven memory formation affects the functioning of the MTL more strongly than the extra-MTL regions. This study proposed a model in which attention has a stronger impact on the formation of neocortical traces than hippocampus/MTL traces, whereas significance has a stronger impact on the formation of hippocampus/MTL traces than neocortical traces. Overall, the taxonomy and model provide an integrative framework in which to place diverse encoding-related findings into a proper perspective.
