However, the way perceptual and memory processes cooperate when we navigate in our everyday life environment remains poorly understood. We studied a stroke patient presenting a brain lesion in the right PHC, which resulted in a mild and quantifiable topographic agnosia, and allowed us to investigate the role of this structure in overt place recognition.Photographs of personally familiar and unfamiliar places were displayed during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Familiar places were either recognized or unrecognized by the patient and 6 age- and education-matched controls in a visual post-scan recognition test. In fMRI, recognized places were associated with a network comprising the fusiform gyrus in the intact side, but also the right anterior PHC, which included the lesion site. Moreover, this right PHC showed increased connectivity with the left homologous PHC in the intact hemisphere. By contrasting recognized with unrecognized familiar places, we replicate the finding of the joint involvement of the retrosplenial cortex, occipito-temporal areas, and posterior parietal cortex in place recognition. This study shows that the ability for left and right anterior PHC to communicate despite the neurological damage conditioned place recognition success in this patient. It further highlights a hemispheric asymmetry in this process, by showing the fundamental role of the right PHC in topographic agnosia.           BODY            1.\u2003Introduction    Neuroimaging studies in healthy participants have pointed out the specificity of the region of the posterior parahippocampal cortex (PHC), since the discovery of its high sensitivity to places and buildings as opposed to other stimulus categories (  ,  ). This place-sensitive area supports the coding of the spatial layout of scenes, a necessary step before their encoding and later recognition (review in  ), and a challenging task given the number of places that we cross every day. A related function is the coding of objects-place associations, particularly on the right hemisphere (  ). However, the contribution of PHC to the visual recognition process itself remains unclear (  ,  ), since previous neuroimaging studies yielded mixed findings in neurologically healthy participants (  ,  ), see also (  ) and supported a clearer role of the retrosplenial complex (RSC) in this function (  ,  ,  ). Thus, it is uncertain to which extent the PHC is implicated during place recognition, beyond its role in perceptual processing.    More insights may be gained with the study of brain-lesioned patients, by determining whether a target area is necessarily required for place analysis, or whether this function can be shouldered by a any other brain region. Topographic agnosia or disorientation is a neurological condition in which patients become unable to find their way in the environment following a focal brain damage (  ,  ). In a specific form of this disorder called landmark agnosia (  ), a lesion around the right posterior PHC \u2014 the region of the right anterior lingual gyrus/PHC/medial fusiform gyrus \u2014 usually impairs spatial orientation in familiar environments, but spares the ability to describe them (e.g.  ,  ,  ,  ). This condition arises as a failure to recognize typical landmarks known before the lesion occurrence (  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), disrupting the interaction between perceptual and memory processes (  ). However, the specific study of the relationships between landmark agnosia, place familiarity, and the location of the lesion in patients with peri-hippocampal lesions has yielded mixed findings, with patients either showing preserved (  ,  ) or altered recognition of known places (  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). A common feature of patients with preserved topographic abilities in familiar environments is the sparing of visual areas located posterior to the PHC (review in  ). On the other hand, disconnection following a focal lesion of the PHC may play a role in this particular neurological disorder (  ; see also  ). Indeed, successful navigation in familiar environments not only involves the PHC, but also a wide range of occipital, medial parietal, temporal and frontal areas (meta-analysis in  ). Thus, a disconnection between the right PHC and other areas of this network may also play a role in this disorder.    Our goal was to investigate place recognition mechanisms in a stroke patient with damage including mainly the right PHC/hippocampus and part of the medial fusiform cortex. The location and extent of the lesion caused a severe prosopagnosia and a partial landmark agnosia (see  ,  ,  ; for similar cases of combined prosopagnosia and topographic agnosia following analogous lesions), providing the unique opportunity to disentangle successful versus unsuccessful place recognition mechanisms in the same participant. Photographs of personally familiar and unfamiliar places were displayed during event-related fMRI of an incidental categorization task (  ). An additional post-scan visual recognition test allowed classifying recognized versus unrecognized familiar places. We first examined the functional integrity of the right and left PHC during basic visualization of places, checking that the left but not right PHC region remained functionally active after the lesion. Then, we assessed the involvement of the PHC during the analysis of recognized (familiar) scenes as compared with unrecognized (familiar or unfamiliar) scenes by means of direct comparison, to specifically probe for brain processes associated with overt place recognition. Moreover, task-based functional connectivity was performed to illuminate the role of functional interactions during overt place recognition. If the PHC plays a fundamental role in this process, then it should be more recruited for recognized places in the patient, either in the contralesional and/or ipsilesional side. If not, the patient should show compensatory activity elsewhere during the recognition process.      2.\u2003Material and methods     2.1. Case report    Patient PR is a right-handed male, 68\u00a0years of age at the time of the present evaluation. He graduated from a university-level business school and is a businessman in the finance domain. One year prior to the current study, he had been admitted to the Neurology Unit of the Geneva University Hospital following a first minor cardio-embolic ischemic stroke involving the right parietal cortex and the occipital cortex bilaterally. The neurological status did not reveal any particular visual field defect. On this occasion, he underwent a series of standard neuropsychological tests assessing language, praxis, executive, memory, attention and visual-perceptual abilities (see   Supplementary Table 1   ). This first neuropsychological testing revealed signs of associative visual agnosia, difficulties in verbal and visual episodic memory, and a mild executive impairment. All other assessed cognitive functions were unimpaired. In a second evaluation one month later (   Supplementary Table 1   ), only verbal working memory difficulties and a mild executive impairment (inhibition) were observed. Signs of associative visual agnosia and verbal episodic memory difficulties had disappeared. Concerning visual episodic memory, his performance improved and was within the normal range, however from a clinical standpoint, immediate recall was estimated to be insufficient given his high educational level. At this time, PR continued working full-time as a business expert.    Ten months later, the patient was admitted again in the same unit due to unprecedented and acute visual complaints consisting in an inability to recognize close family members as well as slight difficulties in orientating himself in his neighborhood. The neurological status was normal, except a left superior quadranopsia which did not affect the following testing. During a third neuropsychological examination (   Supplementary Table 1   ), PR was alert and fully cooperative. His expression was fluent, and his verbal comprehension intact. No visuo-constructive apraxia, neglect, or any other generalized visuo-spatial impairment was observed. Verbal episodic memory was intact. With reference to executive and attentional functions, PR showed mild difficulties in cognitive flexibility and selective attention (Bells' test). With regard to visuo-perceptive abilities, signs of associative agnosia were observed (Visual Object and Space Perception Battery; Birmingham Object Recognition Battery). For the evaluation of prosopagnosia, we used a standard battery from the Geneva University Hospital in addition to standard neuropsychological testing (Benton Face Recognition Test). The patient performed significantly worse than a control group (t-test  ) at the recognition of famous faces (patient\u00a0=\u00a054% correct; control group\u00a0=\u00a077\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012% correct; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), famous faces occupation sorting (matching semantic and visual inputs; patient: 56% correct; control group: 90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09% correct; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), gender identification (patient\u00a0=\u00a066%; control group\u00a0=\u00a092\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% correct; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and at a short version of the Jane task (patient: 50% correct; control group\u00a0=\u00a080\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015% correct; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01;  ;   Supplementary Table 2   ).    Concerning the topographical domain (  ), the patient presented some difficulties in the identification of famous buildings (hesitation, latency, utilization of verbal strategies to facilitate the identification), and a significantly impaired ability to recognize places that are highly familiar for him (26/40 recognized familiar places; see post-scan procedure and results section). In contrast, tests assessing spatial representations were intact as judged by his normal performance on tests evaluating specific spatial abilities (i.e. landscape perspective test, cognitive map recall test, map drawing). Moreover, his capacity to navigate in the hospital was adequate (using both verbal and spatial strategies). In sum, PR presented a mild landmark agnosia, a severe prosopagnosia, signs of associative agnosia and very mild executive and attentional difficulties.    Structural MRI revealed an acute occipito-temporal stroke involving the right PHC along the posterior\u2013anterior axis, the posterior part of the hippocampus and the medial portion of the adjacent fusiform gyrus, sparing the most lateral part of the right fusiform gyrus (  ). The damage was compatible with a lesion of the right parahippocampal place-sensitive area and an impaired ability to recognize personally familiar places in our experiment.      2.2. Participants    Recognition performance and brain activity in the patient was compared with a group of 6 elderly controls (3 males; 5 right-handed; mean age\u00a0=\u00a068.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0years old; mean education years\u00a0=\u00a016.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9), without previous or current neurological or psychiatric disease. This protocol was approved by the Ethic Central Commission of the University Hospital of Geneva. Informed consent was obtained from the participants following the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.    In this study, we followed strictly the same procedure as described previously (  ).      2.3. Pre-scan selection of personally familiar and unfamiliar place stimuli    A few weeks before the fMRI session, the patient was asked to enumerate places he knew well in and around Geneva, as well as to describe some typical routes in the city which he used to take several times a week. His descriptions followed a route-based strategy describing how to go from one place/street to the next to reach a particular destination, and included street names. We selected these personally relevant locations with Google Street view and used them as stimuli for the familiar places condition in the fMRI experiment. The same procedure was applied for the control group.      2.4. Post-scan recognition test    After scanning, the patient was submitted to a self-paced surprise place recognition test. All photographs of familiar places were presented again. The patient had to indicate the name and/or the location of the place shown. A place was considered as   Familiar Recognized   whenever its name was correctly retrieved, or at least when it was correctly localized. In all other cases, the familiar place was classified as   Familiar Unrecognized   . The same procedure was conducted in the control group.      2.5. MRI procedure     2.5.1.  Activation task    We used an incidental categorization task, which required no explicit recognition abilities (  ). Photographs of familiar and unfamiliar places were displayed during fMRI scanning. The participant had to indicate whether the places shown in the photographs were \u201clively\u201d (e.g. imagining noise or traffic jam) or \u201ccalm\u201d compared with a place of reference. Familiar places in the city were named as the reference. Photographs were presented in series of four, shown each in turn during 2\u00a0s at the centre of the screen (  ). Each picture of a given series was a particular viewpoint of the same place. In addition to personal familiarity with places, the succession of the viewpoints within each series was manipulated. In the   Sequential Order   of presentation, the sequence of four pictures could mimic a point of view similar to one turning gradually his head from left to right or the reverse. Alternatively, in the   Scramble Order   of presentation, pictures were presented in a non-progressive order. There were also two unfamiliar control conditions, one in which the same picture was repeated four times within a series (   repeated   condition), the other in which all pictures of a series were taken from different places (   different   condition). The participant indicated his categorical judgment after each series of four pictures, by pressing one of two buttons of a response box at the end of each series. There were 20 trials per condition.      2.5.2.  Equipment    Data were acquired on a 3T MRI system (Trio TIM, Siemens, Germany) with a 12 channel head coil. Visual stimuli were back projected on a screen (E-prime 1.0, Psychology Software Tools Inc., Pittsburgh). Head movements were prevented using an ergonomic air head cushion.      2.5.3.  Scanning protocol    Whole brain functional images were collected using a susceptibility weighted EPI sequence (TR/TE\u00a0=\u00a01810/30\u00a0ms; flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090 degrees; PAT factor\u00a0=\u00a02; FOV\u00a0=\u00a0255\u00a0mm; matrix size\u00a0=\u00a064\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064 pixels). 32 transversal slices were acquired in an interleaved descending manner (slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0mm, interslice gap\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mm, voxel size\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0mm isotropic). High-resolution anatomical images were acquired using a T1-weighted, 3D sequence (MPRAGE; TR/TI/TE\u00a0=\u00a01900/900/2.32\u00a0ms; flip angle\u00a0=\u00a09 degrees; voxel size\u00a0=\u00a00.9\u00a0mm isotropic; 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0192 voxels).       2.6. Imaging data analysis    Anatomical volumes of the patient were normalized to a T1 template of elderly individuals (  ) using a lesion cost function masking (  ). The lesion was manually delineated to create a mask that excluded the lesion from the nonlinear transformation during the normalization step.    Functional images were pre-processed and analyzed using a standard procedure implemented in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8; Wellcome Trust Centre for NeuroImaging London). All volumes were first temporally realigned and resampled to the acquisition time of the middle slice. The data were then spatially realigned to the first slice. The anatomical volumes were spatially coregistered to the mean functional image resulting from the spatial realignment. Functional images were then normalized to the MNI EPI template, resampled to 3\u00a0mm isotropic voxels and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (8\u00a0mm full-width at half-maximum).    In the patient, data were modeled according to the General Linear Model (GLM) which modeled all conditions across recognition states and head movements. In controls, the GLM modeled all task conditions, plus occasionally unrecognized places (as described in  ), as well as head-movements. Each regressor was convolved to a canonical hemodynamic function. A high-pass filter (cut off\u00a0=\u00a0128\u00a0s) and a first-order autoregressive function were applied to account for temporal autocorrelation. Statistical parametric maps (t-maps) were obtained by comparing each condition with baseline activity. Functional connectivity analyses were performed using the generalized PPI approach (  ). Whole-brain analyses were performed on a voxel-wise basis, at a threshold p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected (minimal cluster size\u00a0=\u00a05) for within-subject comparisons and p\u00a0<\u00a00.005 (minimal cluster size\u00a0=\u00a010) for between-subject comparisons, unless specified differently.    For the sake of clarity and simplicity, only data related to the manipulation of familiarity are presented in this paper.      2.7. Scene localizer scan    The response of the right scene-sensitive area around the PHC was investigated in the patient, in order to check how brain responses to pictures of unfamiliar places were impacted by the lesion. Four blocks of scenes, buildings or scrambled stimuli were presented in alternation. In each block, 18 stimuli of the same category were displayed for 750\u00a0ms with an interval of 500\u00a0ms. The patient performed a one-back task in which he had to press a right button at each stimulus repetition. The scanning parameters were identical as in the main experiment. For the analyses, the GLM modeled all conditions plus head-movements. The region of the posterior PHC was functionally localized using the Scenes\u00a0>\u00a0Scrambled Scenes t-contrast at the whole-brain level at a liberal threshold (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 uncorrected, k\u00a0>\u00a05), in order to maximize the possibility to observe activity around the lesion site.       3.\u2003Results     3.1. Behavioral data    First, recognition performance in the patient confirmed a partial agnosia for personally familiar places despite the extended lesion. He was able to visually recognize 26 out of 40 familiar places (65% correct). His recognition abilities still contrasted with the performance achieved by the Control group (97.92% correct recognitions; SD\u00a0=\u00a01.88), and this difference was statistically significant (one-tailed p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; effect size\u00a0=\u00a017.491; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a07.095\u201328.038;  ).      3.2. Scene localizer    Consistent with the lesion site in the right hemisphere, the patient showed activation of the left but not right scene-sensitive area, around the posterior PHC/fusiform gyrus (MNI coordinates: peak 1: -21, \u221240, \u22122, t\u00a0=\u00a02.37; peak 2: -24, \u221255, \u221214; t\u00a0=\u00a02.29; cluster size: 100 voxels;  ). In the right temporal lobe, brain activity was instead observed laterally to the lesion site, much more laterally than in the left hemisphere (MNI coordinates: peak 1: 45, \u221255, \u221214; t\u00a0=\u00a02.44; peak 2: 45, \u221255, \u221223, t\u00a0=\u00a02.22; cluster size: 111 voxels). This confirms that the lesion site has become functionally irresponsive to randomly presented places. However, the lateral activity in the right side might indicate a form of functional reorganization related to place processing or the mobilization of other processes to perform this function.      3.3. Imaging data    We first compared brain activity in patient and controls, to check the functionality of the lesion area and more globally, to highlight areas of hypo- and/or hyper-activity in the patient during the visualization of personally familiar and unfamiliar places.     3.3.1.  Patient \u2013 Control comparison     3.3.1.1.  Familiar places    For Familiar places, the Controls\u00a0>\u00a0Patient contrast notably revealed differential activity in the right PHC, including around the lesion site (including in the anterior and posterior portions of the lesioned tissue), as well as in the right posterior fusiform gyrus region (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005;   ,    upper panel   ). The reverse contrast (Patient\u00a0>\u00a0Controls) revealed enhanced activity in the anterior insula bilaterally in the patient, as well as right temporo-parietal junction, left precentral and middle cingulate gyrus.      3.3.1.2.  Unfamiliar places    The Controls\u00a0>\u00a0Patient comparison again revealed decreased activity in the right posterior fusiform region in the patient (including in the posterior portion of the lesioned tissue). The reverse contrast, Patient\u00a0>\u00a0Controls, showed the same brain areas as for familiar recognized, with the additional recruitment of the right opercular IFG and left orbital IFG (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005;  ,   lower panel   ).    The comparison of brain activity between the patient and the control group thus confirms that the lesion area was systematically hypo-activated in the patient, for both familiar and unfamiliar places.       3.3.2.  Familiar place processing according to recognition in the patient    A first analysis compared brain activity for Recognized places against Unrecognized and Unfamiliar places jointly, to characterize the key areas involved in place recognition irrespective of place familiarity. This comparison (Recognized\u00a0>\u00a0(Unrecognized\u00a0+\u00a0Unfamiliar)) not only revealed an implication of the fusiform gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus and lingual gyrus in the intact side, but also an involvement of the PHC in the anterior portion of the lesion (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001;  ,   top   ;   ,    upper panel   ). This cluster of activity encompassed both lesioned and perilesional (spared) tissue. The bilateral orbital inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), cerebellum, and left middle orbito-frontal cortex (midOFC) were additionally recruited.    To better understand the association between right PHC and successful recognition, we investigated its functional connectivity by defining it as a seed region (sphere, 10\u00a0mm radius) in the following PPI analysis. In the Recognized\u00a0>\u00a0Unrecognized comparison, functional coupling increased between the right anterior PHC in the lesion side, and the left anterior PHC in the intact side (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001,  ,   middle panel   ). Interestingly, this region was located in the homologous region of the lesion site, adjacent to the one observed in the scene localizer (  ,   bottom   ). Importantly, increased functional coupling was also observed with the infero-temporal cortex bilaterally, and right dorsolateral PFC. In marked contrast with the previous comparison, the Recognized\u00a0>\u00a0Unfamiliar contrast (PPI analysis) revealed enhanced coupling between the right anterior PHC and the left cerebellum only, without any coupling with the left PHC. Altogether, the findings indicate a crucial contribution of the anterior PHC in both hemispheres in the recognition of familiar places.    We next compared activity between recognized and unrecognized familiar places with standard contrasts in the patient, to isolate the brain areas enabling visual recognition in the case of personally familiar places. The Recognized\u00a0>\u00a0Unrecognized places comparison globally revealed more left-sided activity, with activations in bilateral middle occipital gyri, left cuneus, RSC, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and right lingual gyrus (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001;  ,   lower panel   ). Finally, for the reverse contrast (Unrecognized\u00a0>\u00a0Recognized), increased activity was observed in the left fusiform gyrus and bilateral orbital gyrus (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005).    To summarize, the right anterior PHC was clearly activated when personally familiar places were recognized, indicating a crucial implication in the analysis of personally familiar places. This region showed increased functional connectivity with the anterior PHC in the contralesional side for recognized compared with unrecognized familiar places. Moreover, joint recruitment of visual areas, left occipito-parietal, left retrosplenial and anterior PFC differentiated between successfully and unsuccessfully recognized places in the patient during the display of familiar information.      3.3.3.  Familiar vs. unfamiliar places in controls    The Familiar > Unfamiliar places contrast revealed a widespread network of activity, including postero-medial areas bilaterally, left PHC, bilateral lateral temporal areas and VMPFC (see   Supplementary Table 3   and  ; p\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a04). These findings are in line with our previous data obtained in a group of young participants (  ).        4.\u2003Discussion    We studied a patient with an extended lesion in the right HC/PHC/medial fusiform gyrus, to investigate the functional role of the PHC in the context of a quantifiable landmark agnosia. This represented a unique opportunity to characterize the brain areas that are necessarily involved in overt place recognition. First, a comparison of brain activity with controls indicated ubiquitous hypo-activation of the right PHC for both familiar and unfamiliar places, confirming that the right PHC was dysfunctional. Secondly, the possibility to access place identity explicitly was associated with increased activity in the right ipsilesional PHC, in a region overlapping with the anterior portion of the lesion site, as well as left fusiform and lingual gyrus in the intact side. Crucially, for personally familiar places, functional connectivity was increased between the PHC in the lesion (right) side, and the PHC in the contralesional side. This last region was located in the homologous region of the lesion in the healthy side, anterior to a scene-sensitive parahippocampal region observed in an independent localizer. Moreover, neural correlates of place recognition were observed in a set of areas comprising bilateral visual areas, the RSC and inferior parietal lobule in the intact hemisphere, and the right IFG.    A key result was the finding of residual activity in the PHC on the lesion side, together with the recruitment of the fusiform gyrus in the intact side, when familiar places were recognized and despite the lesion. This suggests that the right PHC is mandatory in the processing stream leading to visual place recognition. This finding is in accordance with previous lesion studies highlighting the fundamental role of the right PHC in spatial memory (  ,  ,  ), as well as clinical descriptions of much more severe landmark agnosia following brain damage in this area (e.g.  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Nonetheless, our results go beyond, by specifying a neural mechanism for this type of agnostic disorder. Indeed, a related and important result was the increased functional connectivity between the PHC in the lesioned tissue and the PHC in the intact side associated with the recognition of personally familiar information (Recognized\u00a0>\u00a0Unrecognized contrast). This was not the case when looking at the effect of familiarity (Recognized\u00a0>\u00a0Unfamiliar contrast). This left anterior PHC region was located close to a functionally preserved place-sensitive area shown to be functionally preserved in a functional localizer, and homotopic to the lesion site.    Together with adjacent occipito-temporal structures, the posterior aspect of the right PHC is known to form a functional complex dedicated to the analysis of the spatial layouts of scenes (  ). Moreover, it has been suggested that the visuo-spatial function of posterior PHC contrasts with a memory-related function in more anterior sites within this region (  ,  ), in line with recent fMRI data highlighting an anterior\u2013posterior functional segregation expressed by greater functional connectivity with occipital and retrosplenial areas respectively (  ,  ). Our findings are in accordance with this proposal. Interestingly, the PHC is involved in the reinstatement of specific episodic memories triggered by single stimuli previously paired with scenes (  ,  ). Such anterior/posterior PHC interactions may perhaps not be necessary in case of verbal instead of visual stimulation (  ); but see (  ), as this rather depends on the hippocampal complex in the left side (  ) and/or top-down influences by prefrontal cortex (  ). Thus, it may be hypothesized that the ability to access place identity in the context of landmark agnosia is conditioned by the capacity for scenes, after their visual processing in the posterior PHC, to activate reinstatement of personal and/or semantic memories in a more anterior memory-related region of PHC.    The study of a patient with unilateral brain lesion also allowed investigating whether the right and left PHC are equally involved in place recognition. Because the implication of the right PHC was predictive of recognition success in this patient, the data suggest a preponderant role of the right PHC in this process. Further studies are however required to understand whether this specific region is specialized in the retrieval of scene context (e.g.  ), the recognition of objects in scenes (  ,  ), or both (  ). In addition, a gradient from abstract to concrete object response has been described in the PHC (  ). Here, the patient notably failed to recognize familiar places when they lacked salient or unique landmarks, as described in  , that is, when the he was unable to analyze spatial configurations properly. Moreover, the right PHC showed increased functional coupling with the inferior temporal gyrus bilaterally, known for its role in visual object recognition at the terminal portion of the ventral pathway (  ). Thus and despite pathological scores at object recognition as measured by conventional neuropsychological tests, the experimental data suggest that object recognition problems do not fully account for the topographic agnosia here.    Finally, another finding was that successful place recognition in the patient was associated with the recruitment of a distributed network beyond PHC, implicating visual occipito-temporal areas bilaterally, the left RSC, and lateral midOFC. The RSC is particularly known to be strongly sensitive to place familiarity (  ,  ,  ) and involved during mental navigation in a familiar environment (  ,  ). Also, previous work strongly implicates visual areas in patients with deficits of topographical memory (  ,  ,  ). A similar network of occipito-temporal and parieto-medial areas was recently reported to be strongly mobilized during the visualization of familiar environments in healthy participants (  ,  ). Our data corroborate these findings, by showing similar key areas at work in a patient with dysfunctional right posterior hippocampal complex.     4.1. Limitations of the study    The data may be limited by the possibility to generalize the current patient's functioning to similar patients with occipito-temporal lesions. Many factors may modify brain functioning after a lesion, such as the time between the infarct and the study, age of the patient or extent of the lesion. Nonetheless, the data are in line with previous reports of landmark agnosia. Moreover, because prosopagnosia and landmark agnosia were not equally affected in this patient, it was not possible to reliably assess whether compensatory processes that accompany the recognition of familiar places also extend to other stimulus categories such as faces. More studies are necessary to better understand the role the intact hemisphere can play in preserved processes.       5.\u2003Conclusions    In summary, the study of a patient with a mild landmark agnosia due to right occipito-temporal lesion has revealed the fundamental role of the right PHC in the analysis of familiar places that leads to recognition. Importantly, successful recognition was associated with increased functional connectivity between both anterior PHC in each hemisphere. These interactions between homologous regions of PHC may provide a fundamental mechanism enabling perceptual inputs to activate corresponding representations held in long-term memory. Finally, successful recognition was accompanied by the recruitment of a network implicating occipito-temporal, retrosplenial and posterior parietal areas, similarly as in neurologically intact subjects.
