Many techniques exist for localizing the SOZ, including intracranial electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and stereoelectroencephalography. Recently, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in conjunction with independent component analysis (ICA) has been utilized for presurgical planning of SOZ resection, with varying results. In this meta-analysis, we analyze the current role of rs-fMRI in identifying the SOZ for presurgical planning for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Specifically, we seek to demonstrate its current effectiveness compared to other methods of SOZ localization. A literature review was conducted using the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases up to May of 2020. A total of 253 articles were screened, and seven studies were chosen for analysis. Each study was analyzed for SOZ localization by ground truth, SOZ localization by rs-fMRI with ICA, principal component analysis, or intrinsic connectivity contrast, and outcomes of surgery. A meta-analysis was performed to analyze how ground truth compares to rs-fMRI in SOZ localization. The odds ratio comparing ground truth to rs-fMRI was 2.63 (95% confidence interval = 0.66-10.56). Average concordance of rs-fMRI SOZ localization compared with ground truth localization across studies was 71.3%. In the hunt for less invasive presurgical planning for epilepsy surgery, rs-fMRI with ICA provides a promising avenue for future standard practice. Our preliminary results show no significant difference in surgical outcomes between traditional standards of SOZ localization and rs-fMRI with ICA. We believe that rs-fMRI could be a step forward in this search. Further investigation comparing rs-fMRI to traditional methods of SOZ localization should be conducted, with the hope of moving toward relying solely on noninvasive screening methods.
