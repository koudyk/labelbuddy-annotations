As such, there is limited ecological validity to human neuroimaging experiments that use highly controlled tasks to isolate mental processes of interest. However, a growing literature shows how dynamic, interactive tasks have allowed researchers to study cognition as it more naturally occurs. Collective analysis across such neuroimaging experiments may answer broader questions regarding how naturalistic cognition is biologically distributed throughout the brain. We applied an unbiased, data-driven, meta-analytic approach that uses  ", "metadata": {"id": 30793072, "text_md5": "83d629067c2584b25e999a5cacd753fb", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 158], "journal": [159, 172], "publication_year": [174, 178], "title": [189, 310], "keywords": [324, 410], "abstract": [423, 1130], "body": [1139, 1139]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 30793072, "doi": "10.1162/netn_a_00050", "pmid_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30793072/", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pubmed&id=30793072"}, "display_title": "pmid: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30793072/\">30793072</a>", "list_title": "PMID30793072  Cooperating yet distinct brain networks engaged during naturalistic paradigms: A meta-analysis of functional MRI results."}
