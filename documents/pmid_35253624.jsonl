A literature review and meta-analysis of current controlled trials for patients with OCD symptoms was conducted across different databases.

Analysis showed there was an important benefit of neurofeedback treatment in comparison to other treatments (MD\u00a0=\u00a0-6.815; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[-9.033, -4.598]; P <\u00a00.001). The results provide preliminary evidence that NFB is efficacious method for OCD and suggest that more clinical trials are needed to compare common treatment such as medication, neurological, and behavioral interventions.
