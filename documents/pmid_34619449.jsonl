However, the evidence has been divergent and inconclusive. Therefore, it is necessary to perform a meta-analysis identifying a common pattern of altered regional spontaneous brain activity for anxiety disorders. Corresponding research of anxiety disorders, namely, whole-brain rs-fMRI studies that measured differences in regional homogeneity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, or fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, were analyzed in this study. Overall, seven studies with 235 anxiety-disordered patients and 241 healthy controls were ultimately included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was processed by seed-based d mapping. Compared with healthy controls, patients with anxiety disorders showed significantly decreased regional spontaneous brain activities in the right putamen, the right orbital inferior frontal gyrus, and the right temporal pole. No increases in regional spontaneous brain activities were detected in patients relative to the controls. Limited number of available studies, only Asian samples, and insufficient information of sample characteristics. The present study suggests that anxiety disorders are associated with aberrant regional brain activity in areas connected with emotion processing, which extends our understanding of anxiety disorders' pathophysiology.
