The aim of this explorative study was to investigate sex\u2010dependent differences in prefrontal cortex (PFC) functioning during a working memory (WM) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task in regular cocaine users (CUs), as PFC deficits are implicated in the shift from recreational cocaine use to CUD. Neural activation was measured using fMRI during a standard WM task (n\u2010back task) in 27 male and 28 female CUs and in 26 male and 28 female non\u2010cocaine users (non\u2010CUs). Although there were no main or interaction effects of sex and group on n\u2010back task performance, WM\u2010related (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back) PFC functioning was significantly moderated by sex and group: female compared with male CUs displayed higher WM\u2010related activation of the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), whereas female compared with male non\u2010CUs displayed lower WM\u2010related MFG activation. Additionally, WM\u2010related activation of the inferior frontal gyrus, insula, and putamen was negatively associated with cocaine use severity in female but not male CUs. These data support the hypothesis of sex\u2010dependent PFC differences in CUs and speculatively suggest that PFC deficits may be more strongly implicated in the development, continuation, and possibly treatment of CUD in females. Most importantly, the current data stress the importance of studying both males and females in psychiatry research as not doing so could greatly bias our knowledge of CUD and other psychiatric disorders. \n  \nRegular cocaine users display sex\u2010dependent differences in working memory\u2010related prefrontal recruitment, compared with nondrug using controls. These findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex is involved in the etiology of substance use disorders in a sex\u2010dependent matter.\n   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nCocaine is one of the most commonly used illicit drugs in Europe, and the prevalence of use has increased in the past decade.  Although the prevalence of cocaine use is 2\u20133 times higher in men than in women, this gap is slowly closing.  Although women start using cocaine at a later age, they are suggested to progress more rapidly to compulsive use and have higher relapse rates compared with men.  A better understanding of the role of sex in the (neuro)pathology of cocaine use disorder (CUD) could pave the way for the development of sex\u2010tailored treatment strategies. \n\nThe prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in cognitive control and emotion regulation, and compromised PFC functioning is thought to promote the shift from recreational to compulsive drug use.  The few studies that investigated the role of sex in CUDs showed lower dorsomedial and ventromedial PFC activity in female compared with male cocaine users (CUs) during cocaine cue imagery  and in response to negative emotional  and drug\u2010salient stimuli.  In contrast, female CUs also showed higher dorsomedial PFC activity in response to negative emotional stimuli.  Moreover, pharmacological enhancement of PFC functioning (using the noradrenergic \u03b12\u2010receptors agonist guanfacine) mitigated stress\u2010induced arousal and craving ,   and improved cognitive control  in CUD females, but not males. These studies suggest that PFC functioning is specifically impaired in females with a CUD in the context of emotionally salient stimuli, but it remains to be tested if these results generalize to cognitive control\u2010related processes. \n\nWorking memory (WM) refers to the ability to temporarily maintain, update, or manipulate information in an active state and is crucially involved in cognitive control. ,   WM performance is generally associated with activation of a network of various PFC and parietal brain areas, with increased WM load being associated with increased activation.  In various psychiatric disorders, stronger WM\u2010related (high WM load\u00a0>\u00a0low WM load) PFC activation (compared with a control population) is suggested to reflect compensatory but inefficient neural information processing, leading to deficits in WM performance. \n\nWM tasks generally require sustained attention, information storage, memory for temporal order as well as the updating and manipulation of information. ,   As such, WM\u2010related differences in neural activation in CUD populations may reflect differences in any of these functions. Neuroimaging research demonstrated WM\u2010related PFC deficits in CUD, although both higher WM\u2010related PFC activation (middle frontal gyrus [MFG])  and lower PFC activation (cingulate gyrus, middle, superior, and inferior frontal gyrus)  have been reported. Research in other substance use disorders (SUDs) reported similar mixed findings, including WM\u2010related (dorsomedial) PFC overrecruitment in alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients  and cannabis users.  Moreover, higher WM\u2010related (dorsolateral) PFC activity has been reported to predict cannabis use. ,  ,   In contrast, lower WM\u2010related PFC activation (middle and superior frontal gyrus, precentral and postcentral gyrus) has also been demonstrated in AUD patients, ,   with lower WM\u2010related activation of the rostral PFC and ventrolateral PFC predicting relapse to alcohol use. \n\nA possible explanation of previous conflicting findings could be that the majority of these studies did not account for sex differences. Although most neuroimaging WM meta\u2010analyses in nonsubstance using populations did not include sex in their analyses, a 2014 meta\u2010analysis demonstrated higher WM\u2010related limbic and (middle and medial) PFC activity in females but higher WM\u2010related parietal activity in males.  As such, omitting sex from the analyses could greatly obscure the interpretation of WM\u2010related neural deficits in psychiatric disorders, including CUD. \n\nTo date, only one study reported on sex differences in WM\u2010related PFC activation in CUD.  Although this study did not demonstrate any significant group (CUD vs. controls) by sex interaction effects on WM\u2010related PFC activation, this was likely due to insufficient statistical power (i.e., inclusion of three female vs. 16 male CUD patients). Based on the earlier described findings of lower dmPFC activation during the processing of emotionally salient stimuli in female compared with male CUD patients, ,  ,   and the finding that pharmacological enhancement of PFC functioning improved cognitive control while reducing arousal and craving in female CUD patients only, ,  ,  ,   sex\u2010dependent differences in WM\u2010related PFC activation can be expected as well. \n\nThe main aim of this study was to explore sex\u2010dependent differences in WM\u2010related PFC activation in a relatively large sample of regular CUs (27 males and 28 females) and non\u2010cocaine users (non\u2010CU: 26 males and 28 females) using a standardized WM paradigm (the n\u2010back task ). It was hypothesized that (i) CUs would show higher WM\u2010related (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back; 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back) PFC activation compared with non\u2010CUs, (ii) females would show higher WM\u2010related PFC activation compared with males, and (iii) WM\u2010related PFC activation would be highest in female CUs, reflecting inefficient WM\u2010related processes. Of note, because of the mixed and limited previous findings, the direction of these hypothesized effects is highly speculative. \n\n\n## METHODS AND MATERIALS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study is part of a large project designed to investigate the role of sex in the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying CUD. Fifty\u2010four regular CUs and 54 matched non\u2010CUs who conducted the n\u2010back functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task were included in this study. All participants were between 18 and 45\u00a0years of age and free from any MRI contraindications. CUs used cocaine (intranasally) at least four times a month in the past 6\u00a0months (CUs). Non\u2010CUs were excluded if they smoked regularly (at least once per week), had an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)  score\u00a0>\u00a012, used cocaine more than five times in their life, or used illicit substances more than five times in the past 6\u00a0months. All participants provided informed consent and received a monetary compensation. This study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of the Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences, University of Amsterdam (ERB number: 2019\u2010DP\u20109964). \n\n\n### Assessment of substance use and psychological functioning \n  \nSeverity of depressive symptoms was assed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI\u2010II ), state and trait anxiety was assessed using the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI ), attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) symptom severity was measured using the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD\u2010RS ), and impulsivity was assessed with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS\u201011 ) in all participants. The following characteristics of substance use were assessed in CUs only: severity of cocaine use and related problems in the past 12\u00a0months was assessed using the Drug Use Disorder Identification Test for cocaine (DUDIT ), cocaine use (grams and days per month) in the 28\u00a0days prior to study participation was assessed using the Time Line Follow\u2010Back procedure,  and onset age of regular use was assessed using an in\u2010house questionnaire. Moreover, motivation to change cocaine use was assessed using the Readiness to Change Questionnaire (RCQ ), smoking behavior (number of smoking days per week and cigarettes per day) was assessed using an in\u2010house questionnaire, severity of cannabis use was assessed using the Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test\u2010Revised.  Current DSM\u20105 symptoms for CUD, and cannabis use disorder and AUD were assessed using a self\u2010reported questionnaire based on the SCID. \n\n\n### Procedures \n  \nParticipants were recruited through social media and local advertisements in the Amsterdam area, the Netherlands. After signing informed consent, participants were screened on inclusion and exclusion criteria. On the day of testing, participants first completed the questionnaires, after which the MRI scan was made. Participants were instructed to abstain from any drug use in the 24\u2010h preceding the MRI scan. \n\n\n### The   n  \u2010back task \n  \nThe n\u2010back task  consisted of alternating blocks with three load levels: 0\u2010back, 1\u2010back, and 2\u2010back. During each block, participants viewed a series of 15 letters in sequence, including five targets. Blocks lasted 30\u00a0s (each stimulus lasted 2\u00a0s), and the interblock interval was 5\u00a0s, during which the block instructions were repeated. In 0\u2010back blocks, participants were instructed to indicate when the target letter \u201cX\u201d appeared on the screen. In 1\u2010back blocks, participants had to decide if the letter on the screen was identical to the previous one. In 2\u2010back blocks, targets were those letters identical to the letter presented two trials back. Participants were instructed to press a right response box button for targets (right index finger) and a left button for nontargets (left index finger). No additional speed or accuracy instructions were given. Each load level was repeated four times resulting in a 7\u2010min task of 12 blocks. Prior to scanning, all participants first completed a practice block of the n\u2010back task outside of the scanner. \n\n\n### fMRI acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nA 3.0\u2010Tesla Philips Achieva scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) with a 32\u2010channel head coil was used for data acquisition. A T1\u20103D anatomical scan was acquired (TR/TE 8.2/3.8; matrix 240\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240; 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 mm  voxel; transversal slices, 8\u00b0 flip angle) for anatomical reference. Echo planar images (EPIs) were recorded during the n\u2010back task, with 36 ascending axial slices (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 mm  voxel size; slice gap 3\u00a0mm; TR/TE 1.999/28\u00a0ms; matrix 80\u00a0\u00d7\u00a080, 80\u00b0 flip angle). \n\nData were preprocessed using fMRIPrep 1.3.2 : the anatomical scans were corrected for intensity nonuniformity, skull\u2010stripped, spatially normalized, and segmented into cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, and gray matter. The functional data were corrected for susceptibility distortions using a deformation field and subsequently coregistered, motion corrected, and smoothed. ICA\u2010AROMA  was used to automatically remove motion artifacts, and data were resampled to standard space. Further details on the pre\u2010processing pipeline can be found in the  . \n\nfMRI data were further analyzed using SPM12 ( ). First level models included separate regressors for the 0\u2010back, 1\u2010back, and 2\u2010back blocks. These regressors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. A high pass filter (1/128\u00a0Hz) was included in the first\u2010level model to correct for low\u2010frequency signal drift. The contrasts for the 0\u2010back, 1\u2010back, and 2\u2010back blocks were subsequently entered in a second level model to test for the main and interaction effects of sex, group, and n\u2010back load. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nDemographics, scores on (clinical) questionnaires, and n\u2010back behavioral performance were compared between groups with standard univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS for Windows (v.26.0). Differences between groups and sexes in age, alcohol use severity (AUDIT), depressive symptoms (BDI), state and trait anxiety (STAI), impulsivity (BIS\u201011), and ADHD symptom severity (ADHD\u2010RS) were assessed using 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 ANOVAs, testing both main and interaction effects. One\u2010way ANOVAs were subsequently used to test sex differences within the CU group in cocaine use (grams per month and days per month), cocaine use severity (DUDIT), onset age of regular cocaine use, and cannabis use severity (CUDIT). Chi\u2010square tests were additionally used to test for sex differences in the severity of cocaine, alcohol, and cannabis use disorder (mild, moderate, or severe according to the DSM\u20105 criteria), the prevalence of smoking (percent weekly smokers and percent daily smokers), and motivation to change cocaine use. Sex and group differences in n\u2010back performance were assessed in terms of mean reaction time of correct responses and accuracy (proportion correct), using repeated measures ANOVAs. \n\nTo test for main and interaction effects of group, sex, and n\u2010back load (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back and 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back), a whole\u2010brain analysis was performed, with mean framewise displacement (FD) values for each subject as covariate of noninterest to account for potential motion effect. Whole brain analyses were family\u2010wise error (FWE) rate corrected on cluster level (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05), with an initial height threshold on the voxel level of   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001. This analysis was repeated to test whether significant effects were still present after correcting for potential confounding variables. Variables were treated as confounders when there was a significant interaction effect between group and sex on these variables. This was tested for age, education, AUDIT, BDI, ADHD\u2010RS, STAI, and BIS. When a significant whole brain interaction effect was found, the nature of this interaction was explored by performing pairwise comparisons (between sexes within groups and between groups within sexes) using a small volume correction where the mask of the significant cluster served as a the small volume. Additionally, the Marsbar toolbox ( ) was used to extract the mean activity of the significant cluster(s) visualization purposes. \n\nA second whole brain analysis was performed within the CU group only, with cocaine use (grams per month), cocaine use severity (DUDIT\u2010scores), as well as its interaction with sex as regressors of interest, correcting for variations in FD, to test whether cocaine use and cocaine use severity were associated with WM\u2010related (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back; 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back) brain activity in a sex\u2010dependent matter. This analysis was repeated to test whether significant effects were still present after correcting for potential confounding variables. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Demographic and clinical characteristics \n  \nOn average, male and female CUs started using cocaine regularly at the age of 23.5 and 21.4 and used 5.5 and 3.8\u00a0g of cocaine per month, on 7.4 and 4.9\u00a0days, respectively. Most CUs met the DSM\u20105 criteria for CUD (males: 85%, females: 89%). Based on the RCQ, the majority of CUs was actively trying to change cocaine intake (males: 59%, females: 63%), although only 3% of the participants reported to have (had) professional help for reducing their cocaine use. Two thirds of all CUs met the DSM\u20105 criteria for AUD (males: 85%, females: 59%), whereas less than one third of the CUs met the DSM\u20105 criteria for cannabis use disorder (males: 30%, females: 15%). There were no sex differences in the amount of cocaine used per month, readiness to change cocaine use, tobacco use, the prevalence of a DSM\u20105 diagnosis for CUD, cannabis use disorder or AUD, cocaine use severity (DUDIT), alcohol use severity (AUDIT), or cannabis use severity (CUDIT\u2010R). The only significant sex difference was that CU females reported to use cocaine on fewer days per month compared with CU males. Therefore, days of cocaine use per month was treated as a confounder in an exploratory within\u2010group fMRI analysis. See Table\u00a0  for detailed substance use characteristics and statistics. \n  \nSubstance use characteristics in male and female cocaine users \n    \nCUs and non\u2010CUs had similar age, educational level, and trait anxiety scores, but CUs had significantly higher AUDIT, state anxiety, impulsivity (BIS attention and BIS planning), and ADHD\u2010RS (childhood and past 6\u00a0month) scores. Additionally, females had significant higher state anxiety scores compared with males, whereas males reported higher childhood ADHD\u2010RS than females. There was a significant group by sex interaction effect on depressive symptoms (BDI scores), impulsivity (BIS total and motor subscale), and ADHD\u2010RS scores in the past 6\u00a0months. Follow\u2010up tests revealed that although both male CUs and female CUs scored higher on these variables compared with non\u2010CU male and non\u2010CU females, female CUs had significant higher BDI, BIS total and BIS motor scores compared with male CUs, while no such sex differences were present within non\u2010CUs. Because of these differences, BDI, BIS motor, BIS total, and adult ADHD\u2010RS scores were treated as confounders in the fMRI analyses. See Table\u00a0  for all values and statistics. \n  \nDemographic and clinical variables: Main and interaction effects of group and sex \n    \n\n### Behavioral results n\u2010back task \n  \nThere were no significant differences between groups or sexes in n\u2010back performance. There was a significant main effect of n\u2010back load (  F  \u00a0=\u00a0182.11,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001) on reaction times, with reaction times increasing with increasing n\u2010back load. The other main or interaction effects were not significant. There was a significant main effect of n\u2010back load (  F  \u00a0=\u00a0103.47,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001) on accuracy, with accuracy decreasing with increasing n\u2010back load. The other main and interaction effects were nonsignificant. See Figure\u00a0 . See the   for a sensitivity analysis on how large the effect size needs to be to demonstrate significant main and interaction effects of group and sex. \n  \nMain and interaction effects of working memory (WM) load, group, and sex on reaction time and percentage correct during the n\u2010back task. Although there was a main effect of WM\u2010load on reaction time (increase) and percentage correct (decrease), these effects were not moderated by sex, group, or both. CU, cocaine user; WM, working memory \n  \n\n### fMRI results n\u2010back task \n  \n#### Main task effect \n  \nThe main task effects were as expected, with strong WM\u2010related (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back and 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back) activation of fronto\u2010parietal areas and deactivation of the default mode network (Figure\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nMain and interaction effects of WM load, group and sex. In red, brain regions activated with increasing WM load. In blue, brain regions deactivated with increasing WM\u2010load. In green, group differences in WM\u2010related brain activation that are significantly moderated by sex. Mean activity of the whole cluster is extracted and plotted for visualization purposes. The error bars represent the 90% confidence interval. CU, cocaine user; WM, working memory \n  \n\n#### WM\u2010load, group and sex interaction effects \n  \nWM\u2010related brain activation (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back or 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back) did not differ between groups or sexes. For the 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back contrast, there was a significant group by sex interaction in the left dorsal MFG (dMFG). See Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 . Pairwise comparisons on this specific cluster demonstrated that the non\u2010CU males had higher WM\u2010related activation in this region than non\u2010CU females (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.002), although no such difference was between CU males and females. In addition, within non\u2010CU males displayed higher WM\u2010related activation in this region compared to CU males (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.006), whereas CU females displayed higher activation in this region compared to non\u2010CU females (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.002). Adding BDI, BIS\u2010total, BIS\u2010motor, and ADHD symptom severity scores as regressors of noninterest in the whole brain analysis did not alter the outcomes of these analyses (results not reported). There was no significant group by sex interaction effect for the 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back contrast. \n  \nMain and interaction effects of group and sex on working memory\u2010related whole brain activation \n    \nAn exploratory regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between WM\u2010related (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back) dMFG activation and cocaine use severity, grams of cocaine use per month, and days of cocaine use per month in the CU group only. This analysis (with FD and sex included as covariates) demonstrated that none of these variables were significantly associated with WM\u2010related dMFG activation (DUDIT:   B  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.15,   t  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.97,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.34; days/month:   B  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.46,   t  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.99,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.051; grams/month:   B  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.04,   t  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.26,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.80). \n\n\n#### Within CU group whole brain regression analyses \n  \nWhole brain regression analyses with cocaine use (grams of cocaine per month) and cocaine use severity (DUDIT scores) in the CU group demonstrated that cocaine use was negatively associated with WM\u2010related activation of the vermis (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back) and right calcarine sulcus/bilateral cuneus (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back and 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back). Cocaine use was positively associated with WM\u2010related activation of the left cerebellum (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back and 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back) and lingual gyrus and vermis (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back). The association between cocaine use and WM\u2010related activation of the cerebellum, vermis, and occipital cortex was significantly moderated by sex: the association was positive in males but negative in females. In addition, although cocaine use was not associated with any WM\u2010related brain activation, the association between cocaine use severity and WM\u2010related (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back) activation in the left insula, inferior frontal gyrus, the cerebellum, and vermis was also moderated by sex, with a negative association in females, but not in males. Adding days of cocaine use per month as confounder to the model did not change the outcome of these results. See Table 4 and Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nWorking memory load\u2010related activation (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back) of the insula, putamen, and inferior frontal gyrus (in red) is negatively associated with drug use severity in cocaine using women but not in in cocaine using men. Nonetheless, the brain activation patterns are in the similar range as non\u2010cocaine using controls. Mean activity of the whole cluster is extracted and plotted for visualization purposes. The error bars represent the 90% confidence interval. CU, cocaine user \n  \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nWomen have been structurally ignored in addiction\u2010related (neuroimaging) research, and therefore, little is known about sex differences in the neuropathology of addiction. The aim of this explorative study was to investigated sex differences in WM\u2010related PFC functioning in regular CUs, as deficits in PFC\u2010mediated cognitive control are crucially involved in the transition from recreational to compulsive cocaine use.  WM\u2010related (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back; 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back) PFC activity was hypothesized to be higher in CUs compared with non\u2010CUs, with larger differences in female compare with male CUs. There was no main effect of group or sex on brain activity or behavior; however, we did observe a significant group by sex interaction effect in WM\u2010related (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back) left dMFG activation: CU females displayed higher dMFG activity compared with non\u2010CU females, whereas CU males displayed lower dMFG activity compared with non\u2010CU males. Furthermore, WM\u2010related activation of the vlPFC (including the inferior frontal gyrus, insula, and putamen) was negatively associated with cocaine use severity in female CUs, but not in males. Heightened WM\u2010related PFC activation is suggested to reflect compensatory but inefficient information processing, leading to WM deficits.  As such, the current data support our hypothesis that PFC deficits are more strongly implicated in the neuropathology of CUD in females compared with males. Importantly, these findings highlight an urgent need to further unravel the role of sex in the mechanisms underlying CUD. \n\nAlthough heightened WM\u2010related PFC activation in CUD (compared with a control group) may reflect compensatory (but inefficient) mechanisms, ,   heightened PFC activation in recreative CUs (in the absence of behavioral deficits) has also been suggested to reflect resilience to stimulant dependence. In line with this, heightened WM\u2010related activation of the ventrolateral and ventromedial PFC has been shown to protect against relapse in alcohol dependent patients.  In the current study, inferior frontal gyrus activity was negatively associated with cocaine use severity in female CUs only, perhaps reflecting sex\u2010dependent resilience against the development of compulsive cocaine use. It should be noted, though, that the majority of CUs included in our study already transitioned from recreational to compulsive cocaine use. Alternatively, although WM\u2010related dMFG activation was unrelated to cocaine use (severity), the negative association between cocaine use severity and WM\u2010related ventrolateral PFC recruitment may reflect a sex\u2010specific (neurotoxic) effect of cocaine use on the brain, supporting the hypothesis that females are more vulnerable to the (neurotoxic) effects of substances, including cocaine and alcohol. \n\nUnexpectedly, dMFG activation was higher in non\u2010CU males compared with non\u2010CU females. This is remarkable, as females generally display higher WM\u2010related middle and medial PFC activity compared with males.  Interestingly, although various PFC regions are shown to be more active in females compared with males during WM\u2010related tasks,  there seems to be a sex\u2010dependent effect on the lateralization of WM\u2010related dMFG activity as well: higher WM\u2010related activation of the   right   MFG was found in females compared with males, whereas higher WM\u2010related activation of the   left   MFG was found in males,  which is in line with our finding in non\u2010CUs. Sex differences in WM\u2010related brain functioning and lateralization are suggested to result from a combination of prenatal hormonal (testosterone) exposure  and gender\u2010related factors later in life.  Consequently, the current findings may be the result of neurodevelopmental differences, reflecting a sex\u2010dependent predisposition to CUD rather than a consequence of cocaine use. \n\nIt is important to note that no significant group or sex differences were found in behavioral n\u2010back performance. However, the n\u2010back task is generally considered to be less reliable to assess behavioral WM\u2010related deficits.  As such, the behavioral implications of the current findings remain speculative and future research may benefit from including a more reliable WM task outside the MRI scanner to assess behavioral WM performance. \n\nAlthough the causal interplay between PFC functioning, CUD and sex can only be established with future longitudinal research, the current findings suggest that PFC deficits are more strongly implicated in the development, continuation, and perhaps also treatment of CUD in women. Because pharmacological enhancement of PFC control (using the noradrenergic \u03b12\u2010receptors agonist guanfacine)  reduced arousal and craving and improved cognitive control in women with a CUD specifically, ,  ,   women with a CUD may benefit more from interventions targeted at improving PFC\u2010related cognitive and emotional control processes. \n\nInconsistent results from previous SUD studies ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   may be explained by highly variable but mainly low numbers of female participants. An important strength of the current study is that it was specifically set\u2010up to elucidate sex differences in PFC functioning in regular CUs and non\u2010CUs. As such, CU males and females were matched on most cocaine\u2010use\u2010related variables. Although we focused on including nontreatment seeking CUs, the majority of all included CUs met the DSM\u20105 criteria of CUD and were actively trying to change their cocaine use based on the readiness to change questionnaire. Therefore, the current findings likely generalize to treatment seeking CUs as well. \n\nA limitation of the current study is that we only tested for sex differences without taking gender taking into account. According to the Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines, gender is an equally important determinant of health and well\u2010being as sex.  Although the terms sex and gender are often confused in scientific literature, gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviors, and identities of female, male, and gender\u2010diverse people, whereas sex refers to a set of biological attributes in humans and animals that are associated with physiological features. Future research should take gender as a potential moderating factor in the (neuro)pathology of addiction into account, for example, by calculating a gender index based on a variety of psychosocial gender\u2010related variables.  Moreover, CUD is generally associated with polysubstance use. Indeed, approximately two thirds of CUs met the DSM\u20105 criteria of an AUD and almost one third met the DMS\u20105 criteria of a cannabis use disorder. Although there were no sex differences in the prevalence of comorbid SUDs, we have previously demonstrated that deficits in PFC structure are strongly associated with the amount of polysubstance use across regular CUs.  Hence, we cannot fully exclude potential confounding effects of other substances on PFC functioning in the current study. In this study, we instructed CUs to remain abstinent for 24\u00a0h prior to study participation. We decided to not perform a urine screening to check this as cocaine metabolites can be detected in urine up to 6\u00a0days after the last use in regular CUs,  which is much longer than its psychopharmacological effects. A urine test would, therefore, not have been a very accurate measure of intoxication in this specific population. Instead, we used the time\u2010line follow\u2010back procedure to assess cocaine (and other substance) use prior to the experiment, which is generally considered to be a highly reliable method to asses information about substance use, including cocaine use, in both treatment and nontreatment seeking populations.  Nonetheless, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that some CUs were (still) under the influence of some substances. \n\nIn conclusion, the current study provides important first evidence for sex\u2010dependent differences in WM\u2010related PFC recruitment among regular CUs. Although speculative, these data suggest that PFC deficits are more strongly implicated in the development, continuation, and possibly treatment of CUD in females compared with males. Most importantly, the current findings highlight the crucial need for (i) including both males and females in (pre)clinical addiction research and (ii) disaggregating (neuroimaging) findings for males and females separately.  Doing so will not only lead to a better understanding of (sex differences in) the (neuro)pathology of addiction but could also pave the way for the development of sex\u2010tailored treatment of SUDs. \n\n\n## FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE \n  \nThe project was funded by an Amsterdam Brain and Cognition Talent Grant.
