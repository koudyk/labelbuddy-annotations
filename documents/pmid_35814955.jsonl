This study analyzes the extant literature on the neuronal effects of exercise on inhibitory control functions. We searched four online databases (Pubmed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) for relevant peer-reviewed studies to identify eligible studies published before September 1, 2021. Among the 4,090 candidate studies identified, 14 meet the inclusion criteria, and the results of 397 participants in these 14 studies are subsequently analyzed. We quantify the neural effects on the entire brain by using GingerALE software and identify 10 clusters of exercise-induced neuronal with either increases/decreases in the superior temporal gyrus (BA 22), precuneus (BA 7), superior frontal gyrus (BA 10), cuneus (BA 19), precuneus (BA 19), caudate, posterior cingulate (BA 19), middle temporal gyrus (B 37), parahippocampal gyrus (BA 30), precentral gyrus (BA 6). Meta-analytic coactivation map (MACM) showed that multiple functional networks overlap with brain regions with activation likelihood estimation (ALE) results. We propose the effect of exercise on neural activity is related to inhibitory control in the extended frontoparietal, default mode network (DMN), visual network, and other pathways. These results provide preliminary evidence of the neural effects of exercise on inhibitory control.
