{"text": "Ikemoto, Satoru and Pana, Raluca and von Ellenrieder, Nicol\u00e1s and Gotman, Jean\nEpilepsia Open, 2023\n\n# Title\n\nElectroencephalography\u2013functional magnetic resonance imaging for clinical evaluation in focal epilepsy\n\n# Keywords\n\nclinical evaluation\ndecision making\nfocal epilepsy\nsimultaneous EEG\u2010fMRI\nsurgical treatment\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Objective \n  \nWe aimed to evaluate the contribution of simultaneous recording of electroencephalography\u2013functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG\u2010fMRI) in the diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome, localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ), and decision\u2010making regarding surgical treatment. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe performed a retrospective study to evaluate patients with focal epilepsy who underwent EEG\u2010fMRI. Two evaluators assessed epilepsy syndrome, presumed focus, and surgical candidacy and defined confidence levels. They assessed these clinical characteristics first without EEG\u2010fMRI and then including EEG\u2010fMRI to assess how the results of EEG\u2010fMRI changed the evaluations. We also determined how the clinical evaluation was affected by the concordance level between the blood oxygen level\u2010dependent (BOLD) response and the presumed focus location, and by the confidence level of the BOLD response itself based on the   t  \u2010value of the primary and secondary clusters. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nFifty\u2010one scans from 48 patients were included. The BOLD map affected 66.7% of the evaluations by altering evaluation items (epilepsy syndrome, presumed focus, or surgical candidacy) or their confidence levels. EEG\u2010fMRI results increased the confidence levels of epilepsy syndrome, presumed focus, or surgical candidacy in 47.1% of patients but reduced clinical confidence in these features in 11.8%. More specifically, the confidence levels increased for epilepsy syndrome in 28.5%, identification of presumed focus in 33.9%, and determination of surgical candidacy in 29.4%. The BOLD signal confidence level, whether high or low, did not influence these clinical factors. \n\n\n## Significance \n  \nPrevious studies have emphasized the utility of EEG\u2010fMRI for the localization of the epileptogenic zone. This study demonstrated the potential of EEG\u2010fMRI to influence clinical confidence when determining epilepsy syndrome, the presumed epileptic focus, and surgical candidacy. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n   Key points   \n  \nSimultaneous electroencephalography\u2013functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG\u2010fMRI) recording is a noninvasive method to examine patients with epilepsy. \n  \nEEG\u2010fMRI can provide additional information for clinical assessment in the evaluation of focal epilepsy. \n  \nClinical evaluation was positively affected by EEG\u2010fMRI in 47.1% of scans. \n  \nEEG\u2010fMRI increased the estimated confidence of surgical candidacy in 29.4%. \n  \n \n\n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nPharmacoresistant epilepsy accounts for 30% of epilepsy cases,  and intractable seizures and various comorbidities are a heavy burden to patients.  One treatment of pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy is the surgical removal of the epileptogenic zone (EZ). ,   To determine a treatment plan, clinicians investigate and consider many factors including age, clinical history, seizure semiology and frequency, drug responsiveness, cognitive function, electroencephalography (EEG), and the results of various brain imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single\u2010photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET). However, accurate identification and localization of the EZ can be challenging in some patients. For example, scalp EEG lacks spatial resolution and the interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) indicate the irritative zone, which does not always reflect the EZ.  IEDs can propagate through the cortex  and may occur contralateral to the epileptic focus. ,   Intracranial EEG (iEEG) is sometimes helpful but invasive and only covers a limited space.  Simultaneous recording of EEG and functional MRI (EEG\u2010fMRI) is a noninvasive method that has the potential to localize the EZ, yet its clinical use remains limited. ,   IED\u2010related EEG\u2010fMRI displays hemodynamic changes in blood oxygen level\u2010dependent (BOLD) signals related to IEDs ,   often in the immediate vicinity of the intracranial EEG focus.  One study reported the accuracy of EEG\u2010fMRI in localizing the seizure\u2010onset zone (SOZ) with stereo\u2010EEG (SEEG) and found that 77% of patients had at least one study with primary EEG\u2010fMRI clusters concordant with an SEEG\u2010defined SOZ.  Another study claimed that the spike\u2010related BOLD response represented intrinsic connectivity networks.  Several studies have proposed routine clinical use of EEG\u2010fMRI in the pre\u2010surgical evaluation of medically refractory epilepsy patients. ,  ,  ,  ,   However, these reports did not assess the added value of EEG\u2010fMRI in a standard clinical evaluation. \n\nTherefore, we aimed to determine how the addition of EEG\u2010fMRI in the pre\u2010surgical evaluation of medically refractory epilepsy patients impacts the diagnosis of the epilepsy syndrome, the localization of the epileptic focus, and the clinician's judgment regarding surgical candidacy of the patient. We retrospectively analyzed the changes that may be realized by adding EEG\u2010fMRI images to the standard evaluation of the epileptic syndrome, the presumed focus, and surgical candidacy. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Study population \n  \nWe identified consecutive patients with focal epilepsy and sufficient clinical information for assessment (i.e., seizure semiology, EEG, MRI, PET, and neuropsychological assessment) from a database of patients who underwent EEG\u2010fMRI from January 2014 to December 2016. At our institute, we generally consider performing EEG\u2010fMRI in cases where the EZ is difficult to identify or ambiguous by standard localization methods. We reviewed the patient's EEG to check if there were frequent IEDs to determine the suitability for EEG\u2010fMRI. Frequent IEDs were defined as more than 5\u201310/h. Therefore, the cases with an EEG study with few or no IEDs before scanning did not undergo an EEG\u2010fMRI. Each participant provided written informed consent in accordance with the Research Ethics Committee of the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital. \n\n\n###  EEG\u2010fMRI   acquisition \n  \nThe imaging acquisition methods were as described in previous studies. ,  ,  ,   EEG was recorded inside a 3 Tesla Siemens Trio MRI scanner with 25 MR\u2010compatible electrodes placed on the scalp, according to the 10\u201320 (reference FCz) and 10\u201310 (F9, T9, P9, F10, T10, P10) electrode systems, using a Brain Amp system (Brain Products, 5\u2009kHz sampling). fMRI functional images were collected in 6\u2010minute runs for a total scan time of 60\u201390\u2009minutes with the patient at rest, using the following T2*\u2010weighted echo planar imaging sequences: repetition time (TR), 1.9\u2009seconds; echo time (TE), 25\u2009ms; 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964 matrix; 33 3.7\u2009mm slices; 3.7\u2009\u00d7\u20093.7\u2009\u00d7\u20093.7\u2009mm  voxel; flip angle 90\u00b0. The IEDs were grouped into types, based on spatial distribution and morphology, and each type constituted a single study. IED types were spike, sharp wave, spike, and wave complex or paroxysmal slow wave, and those IEDs were identified as a burst event when it lasted longer than 1\u2009s; otherwise, it was recognized as a single event. Thus, some patients had more than one study. \n\nfMRI data were analyzed as an event\u2010related design,  each type of IED was built as a regressor, and all regressors were included in the same general linear model and convolved with four hemodynamic response functions (HRFs) peaking at 3, 5, 7, and 9\u2009seconds.  A statistic t\u2010map was created for each regressor using the other regressors as confounders for each event type. A combined t\u2010map was created by taking the highest   t  \u2010value at each voxel from the four t\u2010maps created with the four HRFs (  t  \u2010value\u2009=\u2009contrast value divided by the standard error). A threshold at an uncorrected   t  \u2009>\u20093.1 was applied to the single combined t\u2010map, and the responses with a   t  \u2010value higher than the significance threshold corresponding to a corrected whole\u2010brain topological false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 were identified. \n\n\n### Clinical evaluation protocol \n  \nThe evaluation pipeline is shown in Figure\u00a0 . The assessment consisted of a pre\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation, EEG\u2010fMRI image evaluation, post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation, and an assessment of the impact of EEG\u2010fMRI on the clinical evaluation. First, we conducted a pre\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation according to the clinical history, seizure semiology, EEG, MRI, and PET. Two epilepsy experts independently evaluated the epilepsy syndrome, presumed epileptic focus, and surgical candidacy. SEEGs were included in the evaluation if they were performed within 1\u2009year of the EEG\u2010fMRI scan. Regarding   epilepsy syndromes  , patients were grouped into temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), posterior\u2010quadrant epilepsy (PQE), focal epilepsy, multifocal epilepsy, and undetermined. The definition of \u201cfocal epilepsy\u201d was used in cases of suspected focal epilepsy where the region of presumed focus cannot be established, while \u201cundetermined\u201d was used when it cannot be determined whether there is focal or generalized epilepsy. Regarding the   epileptic focus  , the evaluators selected a lobe that seemed most likely to include the presumed focus from clinical information as mentioned above; patients were grouped into right (R), left (L), or bilateral (B), and grouped into frontal lobe, temporal lobe, posterior\u2010quadrant region, multifocal, or undetermined location. Regarding   surgical candidacy  , patients were grouped into \u201cyes\u201d (a surgical candidate) or \u201cno\u201d (not a surgical candidate). For each item (epilepsy syndrome, presumed focus, and surgical candidacy), the confidence level was evaluated at three levels (high, moderate, and low). Definitions of estimated confidence level included:   high  , almost all information (clinical history, all examinations) was concordant with the diagnosis of epileptic syndrome and presumed epileptic focus;   moderate  , general information was concordant, some information was discordant;   low  , some information indicates the diagnosis, and the diagnosis is uncertain but more likely than others. Epilepsy syndrome, presumed focus, and surgical candidacy were \u201cevaluation items\u201d in this study. \n  \nPipeline illustrating the evaluation steps. Pre\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation: according to clinical history, seizure semiology, EEG, MRI, and PET, epilepsy experts evaluated epileptic syndrome, presumed epileptic focus, and surgical candidacy. EEG\u2010fMRI image assessment: concordance and confidence levels were assessed. Post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation: a re\u2010assessment was performed with the results of EEG\u2010fMRI. Assessment of the impact of EEG\u2010fMRI on clinical evaluation: quantification of how EEG\u2010fMRI affected the evaluation. \n  \nNot all findings are consistent, and it is often unclear what type of information such as imaging, semiology, EEG, and other findings is most important. The decision on how to weigh the different, possibly contradictory factors reflects clinical judgment and experience. Some clear semiological signs may provide stronger evidence than uncertain imaging results, but the reverse can also occur. The combination of evidence is the essence of the expert's work. \n\nThe BOLD signal of EEG\u2010fMRI was evaluated by the degree of concordance between the BOLD response and presumed epileptic focus of the pre\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation, using the following criteria:   concordant  , presumed focus and highest positive BOLD response in the same lobe;   partially concordant  , any BOLD response, including negative BOLD responses, intersected the presumed focus but the highest response was not in the same lobe as the presumed focus;   discordant  , no BOLD response intersected the presumed focus. \n\nAfter the BOLD maps were visually inspected, a post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation was performed, including epilepsy syndrome, presumed epileptic focus, and surgical candidacy, as for the pre\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation. We reported \u201cno effect\u201d when the level of confidence was unchanged between pre\u2010 and post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluations, and an \u201cincrease\u201d when the BOLD map helped to increase evaluation confidence. \u201cIncrease\u201d included instances when the estimated confidence level changed from low to moderate, low to high, or moderate to high in any evaluation item in epilepsy syndrome, presumed focus, or surgical candidacy. On the other hand, we reported a \u201cdecrease\u201d if the estimated confidence level was changed upon EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation from high to moderate, high to low, or moderate to low. We reported \u201cchanged evaluation only\u201d when the confidence level was unchanged from pre\u2010 to post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation, but at least one evaluation item was changed (for instance, focus location changed from temporal to frontal, without a change in confidence level). \n\n\n### Confidence level of   EEG\u2010fMRI   image \n  \nThe confidence level of the BOLD response was assessed as per a previous study in which an association was found between cases with good surgical and EEG/fMRI studies with a large maximum   t  \u2010value and a clear separation between the maximum   t   and the   t   of the second highest cluster, thus characterizing isolated large responses.  This situation was defined by the following equation: in which   x   is the maximum   t  \u2010value and   y   is the difference between the maximum   t  \u2010value and the peak of the second most significant cluster. If this inequality was satisfied, the image was considered to have   high BOLD signal confidence  . According to our previous report, such a high confidence study had a negative predictive value for the surgical outcome of 100% of cases and a positive predictive value of 44%.  In other words, the t\u2010maps that fulfill the inequality are defined as high confidence cases, and none of these cases resulted in a good outcome if the cluster with the maximum absolute   t  \u2010value was not resected. If the inequality was not satisfied, the BOLD result was considered to have   low BOLD signal confidence  . We assessed if the confidence level of the BOLD image had an influence on the results of the re\u2010evaluation. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nData were analyzed using SPSS (SPSS Inc.). Continuous variables were compared using the Mann\u2013Whitney   U  \u2010test, while categorical variables were compared using Pearson's chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test. For all analyses,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Clinical profiles \n  \nIn total, 92 consecutive EEG\u2010fMRI studies, performed on 89 patients from January 2014 to December 2016, were included in this study (Figure\u00a0 ). Three patients underwent EEG\u2010fMRI studies twice. Among the 92 studies, the following were excluded: 23 studies due to the absence of IEDs during the scan (25.0%), two due to the presence of severe artifacts, seven due to generalized epilepsy being diagnosed in the pre\u2010evaluation, and two due to missing information. We excluded patients with presumed generalized epilepsy because this study emphasized the localization value of EEG\u2010fMRI. Therefore, 58 studies from 55 patients were included in the EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation. BOLD maps revealed that seven studies (12.1%) did not have a BOLD response above threshold. Finally, 51 studies from 48 patients were included in the evaluation (Table\u00a0 ). The mean and standard deviation of the number of analyzed IEDs was 128.1\u2009\u00b1\u2009216.6 (n\u2009=\u200951) in the group with a significant BOLD response, which was significantly higher than in the no significant BOLD response group with 23.7\u2009\u00b1\u200947.2 (n\u2009=\u20097) (  P  \u2009=\u20090.005). \n  \nFlowchart of enrolled patients. \n  \nThe background of the patients was as follows: 15 males, 33 females; median age at the time of scanning, 28\u2009years; median age at onset, 15\u2009years. We performed an EEG and MRI on all patients. Thirteen patients had a pre\u2010existing surgical resection with another intervention under consideration. Regarding the etiology of epilepsy, nine patients suffered from focal cortical dysplasia, five from periventricular nodular heterotopia, four from tumor, one from hippocampal sclerosis and 32 were unknown. SEEG was performed in 13 cases. The high proportion of unknown etiologies reflects that EEG\u2010fMRI studies are most often requested in \u201cdifficult\u201d patients. \n\n\n### Pre\u2010 and   post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI   evaluation \n  \nThe pre\u2010EEG fMRI case evaluation was performed while considering standard elements of a phase 1 pre\u2010surgical evaluation including EEG, PET, semiology, etc. It is noteworthy that some patients had undergone invasive studies and/or surgery prior to this assessment. The results of pre\u2010 and post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation are given in Table\u00a0 . The impact of EEG\u2010fMRI results on the clinician's confidence level in identifying the epilepsy syndrome, the epileptic focus, and the patient's surgical candidacy are presented in Table\u00a0 . Three cases are detailed next to demonstrate these findings. \n  \nPre\u2010 and post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation. \n      \nConfidence level of pre\u2010 and post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluated by Evaluator A/B. \n    \nCase 1 (Figure\u00a0 ) is an example in which EEG\u2010fMRI increased the confidence level of the evaluators when assessing the various elements of the pre\u2010surgical investigation. The patient was a 24\u2010year\u2010old woman with nocturnal seizures manifesting with hyperventilation and fear. Interictal EEG showed occasional spikes in the right frontal region (F4, Fz). Her MRI was non\u2010lesional and ictal EEG was not recorded. Therefore, the evaluators assumed the presumed focus was right frontal with low\u2010to\u2010moderate confidence because her seizure semiology did not indicate any laterality, and there was little information indicating the localization of the EZ other than the location of IEDs. The BOLD map showed the maximum positive BOLD response in the right frontal region (peak   t  \u2010value, 7.9), which was concordant with the clinical information. In the post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation, both evaluators increased their confidence in the localization of the presumed focus and in surgical candidacy categories. \n  \nRepresentative cases where EEG\u2010fMRI affected evaluation. A, Increased confidence; pre\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation was frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), presumed focus was right frontal (RF) lobe, and a positive BOLD response was concordant. This result increased the confidence of surgical candidacy. B, Decreased confidence; pre\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation was FLE, presumed focus was RF, and a positive BOLD response was located in the right posterior\u2010quadrant (RPQ) area, which was discordant. This result decreased the confidence of surgical candidacy. C, EEG\u2010fMRI changed diagnosis: pre\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation was focal epilepsy, presumed focus was unknown, a negative BOLD response was in the default mode network (DMN), and a positive BOLD response. These findings in the subcortical regions are indicators of generalized epilepsy. This result changed epilepsy syndrome to generalized epilepsy in post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation. \n  \nCase 2 (Figure\u00a0 ) is an example in which EEG\u2010fMRI decreased the evaluators' confidence. The patient was a 35\u2010year\u2010old man with seizures manifesting with right oculo\u2010cephalic deviation and vocalization. Interictal EEG showed spikes and fast activity mostly in the right frontal regions and rarely right temporal regions independently. His MRI was non\u2010lesional and ictal EEG was not recorded. Therefore, the evaluators considered the presumed focus in the frontal region as the most likely possibility with a low confidence in laterality, but the maximum positive BOLD response was in the right posterior\u2010quadrant and BOLD responses were widely scattered in other regions in the hemisphere. Therefore, the BOLD map raised doubts about the presumed focus and suggested the possibility of an EZ including a wider right hemispheric area, and thus lowered the confidence level of the presumed focus and surgical candidacy. \n\nCase 3 (Figure\u00a0 ) is an example where the diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome was changed to generalized epilepsy due to the EEG\u2010fMRI findings. The patient was a 27\u2010year\u2010old woman with seizures manifesting with right oculocephalic deviation as well as elevation and abduction of the right arm, occasionally evolving to focal to bilateral tonic\u2013clonic seizures. Interictal EEG showed diffuse spikes or poly\u2010spike and wave complexes predominantly seen in the bifrontal head regions. Her MRI was non\u2010lesional. Ictal EEG was controversial because the only change prior to the seizure becoming bilateral tonic\u2013clonic was a low\u2010amplitude fast activity over bilateral frontal head regions. Therefore, the evaluators considered that the seizure semiology indicated focal epilepsy, particularly FLE; however, EEG findings indicated bi\u2010hemispheric involvement. The pre\u2010evaluation was focal epilepsy, but the negative BOLD response was in the default mode network (DMN) and the positive BOLD response was in the thalamus bilaterally. There were positive BOLD responses in the right mesial frontal cortex and bilateral dorsolateral frontal activations. Such features of subcortical regions are observed in generalized epilepsy.  Considering the fact that the seizure semiology of generalized epilepsy can show focal manifestations, the BOLD map raised the possibility of changing the diagnosis to generalized epilepsy and decreased the confidence level of surgical candidacy. \n\n\n###  EEG\u2010fMRI   effect on the evaluation \n  \nThe main results are shown in Figure\u00a0 . Of the 51 studies completed, EEG\u2010fMRI results influenced the clinician's confidence level in 66.7% of cases. In 47.1% of studies, the confidence level was increased, and in 11.8% of studies, the confidence level was decreased. There was a change in evaluation items without a change in confidence level in 7.8% of cases. The confidence level was increased with regards to the classification of epilepsy syndrome in 28.5%, identification of presumed focus in 33.9%, and determination of surgical candidacy in 29.4%. (These figures include duplicates, i.e., cases with the increase of confidence level on two or more evaluation items). The results of surgical candidacy in pre\u2010 and post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI are shown in Table\u00a0 . The BOLD map increased the confidence of surgical candidacy in 29.4% of cases (percentage of increased confidence cases in the \u201cyes\u201d group), and 17.7% were confirmed as poor surgical candidates (percentage of increased confidence cases in the \u201cno\u201d group), due to the uncertain epileptic focus localization or the BOLD map demonstrating the presence of multiple foci. \n  \nResults at each step of the EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation. N\u2009=\u2009Number of cases by Evaluator A | B (percentage of 51 studies that completed evaluations). \n  \n\n###  BOLD   signal concordance \n  \nThe distribution of BOLD signal concordance with the presumed focus was as follows: 27.5% were concordant; 43.2% were partially concordant; 28.5% were discordant. Among the concordant group (concordant and partially concordant), 59.5% showed increasing confidence in any of the evaluation items; among the discordant group, 18.2% showed decreasing confidence. The mean and standard deviation of the number of IEDs in all studies was 128.1\u2009\u00b1\u2009216.6. The mean and standard deviation of the number of IEDs in the concordant group were 126.1\u2009\u00b1\u2009229.5 and 134.4\u2009\u00b1\u2009178.6 in the discordant group. There was no significant group difference in the number of IEDs (  P  \u2009=\u20090.90). \n\n\n### Confidence level of   BOLD   response \n  \nConfidence levels of the BOLD maps were analyzed (reflecting the strength of the BOLD response); 32 BOLD maps had high BOLD signal confidence, and 19 BOLD maps had low signal confidence. Among the 32 maps in the high confidence group, 20 were positive and 12 were negative BOLD response. Among the 19 maps in the low confidence group, 12 were positive and seven were negative. There was no association between these positive and negative BOLD responses and etiology. The increases in the confidence level in the clinical assessment were found in 54.7% of the high BOLD signal confidence group and in 34.2% of the low BOLD signal confidence group. There was no significant difference between these two proportions. We evaluated the relationship of the number of IEDs to the BOLD signal confidence: high confidence group, mean 150.6\u2009\u00b1\u2009268.6; low confidence group; mean 91.3\u2009\u00b1\u2009110.3. There was no significant group difference in the number of IEDs (  P  \u2009=\u20090.28). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn this retrospective simulation study, we determined how EEG\u2010fMRI may affect clinical evaluation and decision\u2010making regarding the diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome, localization of presumed epileptic focus, and surgical candidacy in focal epilepsy. The results are likely influenced by the perceived clinical value that the evaluators attribute to EEG\u2010fMRI results. A similar situation arises whenever one considers the contribution of a new diagnostic method to standard practice. The gold standard for such an evaluation would be a randomized control trial; however, this is rarely done when introducing new localization methods for epilepsy due to high cost and complexity. The evaluators' confidence in the method was based on the literature on EEG\u2010fMRI, which showed the frequent but far from perfect concordance of BOLD responses with epileptic foci  as well as personal experience in their clinical practice. A similar methodology has been used in evaluating EEG\u2010fMRI for surgery,  the contribution of EEG source analysis, ,  ,   resting\u2010state functional connectivity,  and interictal PET findings. \n\nThe current study demonstrates that EEG\u2010fMRI provides additional value when combined with traditional pre\u2010surgical investigations of medically refractory epilepsy by increasing confidence in the identification of epilepsy syndrome, localization, and surgical candidacy. In the 51 studies where BOLD maps were used for evaluation, clinical confidence was increased in 47.1% of cases, which is significant. The clinical confidence was reduced in a minority of cases (11.8%) (Figure\u00a0 ). A PET study reported comparable results: PET contributed to the presurgical evaluation and decision\u2010making process in 47% of cases with drug\u2010resistant focal epilepsy.  Additionally, the fact that the two evaluators in this study had very similar results reinforces the potential clinical applicability of EEG\u2010fMRI in the context of the evaluation of focal epilepsy and surgical candidacy. \n\n###  EEG\u2010fMRI   effect on epileptic syndrome and localization \n  \nApproximately 50% of EEG\u2010fMRIs added confidence regarding epileptic syndrome, presumed focus, and/or surgical candidacy in the present study. A previous report shows that EEG\u2010fMRI contributed to the localization of the epileptic focus in half of the patients in comparison to EEG alone.  Another study reported that EEG\u2010fMRI was concordant with the spike location of 8/9 patients and it may provide different types of information supporting topography, concordance with PET and SPECT, and structural peculiarities for patients with non\u2010lesional FLE.  We used several modalities in addition to EEG in the pre\u2010evaluation, and we confirmed that EEG\u2010fMRI could add information to a relatively standard clinical evaluation. \n\n\n###  EEG\u2010fMRI   effect on surgical candidacy \n  \nEEG\u2010fMRI increased the estimated confidence of surgical candidacy in 29.4% of patients. A study by Kowalczy et al  reported that EEG\u2010fMRI results critically influenced the decision to offer surgery in 17% (10/59) of the patients in their cohort. This led to resection in one patient and opened new prospects of surgery in three others. Their results align with our study. On the other hand, there is some evidence ,   that EEG\u2010fMRI supports the classification of patients as non\u2010surgical candidates in cases when the BOLD response has multiple activation regions. For example, a case in which EEG\u2010fMRI indicated the possibility of multiple EZs was not considered a surgical candidate and would not be reflected in previous studies of surgical outcome. Our study shows that 17.7% of cases were no longer considered surgical candidates, due to uncertainty of the focus or the presence of multiple foci after this was clarified by EEG\u2010fMRI. Therefore, EEG\u2010fMRI may be useful for the localization of the epileptic focus prior to surgical treatment but also in the generation of supportive information for exclusion of a surgical candidate. \n\n\n### Confidence level of   BOLD   response \n  \nWe assessed the confidence of the BOLD response according to our previous report.  A formula was used to classify the images into high and low BOLD signal confidence. In our previous study, if the region of the peak response of the high confidence level was not resected, no patient had a good outcome. For medium and low confidence levels, only 18% and 28% had a good outcome, respectively. The authors concluded that the negative predictive value remained high for all confidence levels, and that resection of the primary cluster is necessary but not sufficient to obtain a good outcome because the positive predictive value was low.  In the present study, the concordance and confidence level of the BOLD response did not affect the results. The reason may be that some cases of concordant BOLD responses only confirmed the evaluation but did not change it, whereas some discordant cases were considered to have provided important information resulting in a changed evaluation. This suggests that EEG\u2010fMRI may be useful whether or not the BOLD response is concordant with the presumed focus. Another reason may be the limitation of the evaluation of the level of confidence, which is calculated by the difference of   t  \u2010values between primary and secondary clusters, since even secondary clusters were consistent with EZ in previous reports. ,  \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe key limitation of our study is that it was a retrospective single\u2010center study. A prospective randomized study is desirable, and postoperative outcomes may be a good indicator of whether the EEG\u2010fMRI results lead to better EZ localization and better surgical decisions. A single\u2010center study may contain bias with respect to the patients' background. There may be a selection bias affecting our results since EEG\u2010fMRI is typically requested in complex patients. However, this bias, which exists in all surgical candidacy studies, is seemingly unavoidable. Our successful EEG\u2010fMRI rate (55.4%; 51/92) was similar to that of another study (50%).  In our investigation, 25% of studies reported inactive IEDs during recording and 7.6% were excluded due to the absence of a significant BOLD cluster. A previous report excluded 46% of scans due to a lack of epileptic activity in the scalp EEG during the recording.  A lower rate of exclusions in our study may be due to patient selection. Performing a scalp EEG is important to determine whether a patient has active or inactive IEDs, and long\u2010term EEG recording assists in this conclusion.  At our institute, inactive IED patients were not EEG\u2010fMRI candidates, and this different selection of patients may have affected our results. Conventional IED\u2010related EEG\u2010fMRI is only analyzed when IEDs are recorded during scanning; thus, one of the limitations of EEG\u2010fMRI is that it is only adapted to patients with active IEDs.  The number of BOLD responses appears to correlate to the number of IEDs analyzed with fewer BOLD responses recorded in patients with few IEDS and vice versa, a phenomenon previously reported in the literature.  Our results were similar, with significantly fewer IEDs in the no BOLD group than in the group with BOLD responses. \n\nAlthough not critical for positive identification of the EZ, a test with high negative predictive value could improve patient selection of surgical candidacy, decreasing cost and exposure to unnecessary risk of surgery by this non\u2010invasive technique. Thus, the strength of this study is that it included cases that were not considered for surgery, and it assessed both the increase and decrease of the confidence level by adding EEG\u2010fMRI to a standard clinical evaluation for focal epilepsy. \n\n\n\n## CLINICAL RELEVANCE/FUTURE DIRECTIONS \n  \nPrevious studies have advocated for routine clinical use of EEG\u2010fMRI when investigating medically refractory epilepsy, but the impact of this noninvasive modality on clinical decision making had not been previously explored. The current study revealed that EEG\u2010fMRI can increase the confidence level of the identification of the epilepsy syndrome, localization, and/or influence surgical candidacy in nearly half the cases, whereas it decreases the clinician's confidence in assessing these factors in only 11.8% of cases. Additionally, EEG\u2010fMRI increased the estimated confidence of surgical candidacy in 29.4% of studies while proposing to exclude surgery in 17.7% of cases. This study demonstrated the potential of EEG\u2010fMRI results to influence clinical assessment and surgical candidacy. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings, which are nevertheless encouraging. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT \n  \nNone of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose.
