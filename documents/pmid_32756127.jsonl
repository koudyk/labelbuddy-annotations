This protocol will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). The Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI) software will be used for this voxel-wise meta-analysis. This meta-analysis will identify the most consistent ReHo alterations in CP. To our knowledge, this will be the first voxel-wise meta-analysis that integrates ReHo findings in CP. This meta-analysis will offer the quantitative evidence of ReHo alterations that characterize brain local functional connectivity of CP. CRD42019148523.
