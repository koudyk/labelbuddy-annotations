Here, we address the types of fMRI that could better support applications of neuroscience to the classroom. This \u2018educational fMRI\u2019 comprises eight main challenges: (1) collecting artifact-free fMRI data in school-aged participants and in vulnerable young populations, (2) investigating heterogenous cohorts with wide variability in learning abilities and disabilities, (3) studying the brain under natural and ecological conditions, given that many practical topics of interest for education can be addressed only in ecological contexts, (4) depicting complex age-dependent associations of brain and behaviour with multi-modal imaging, (5) assessing changes in brain function related to developmental trajectories and instructional intervention with longitudinal designs, (6) providing system-level mechanistic explanations of brain function, so that useful individualized predictions about learning can be generated, (7) reporting negative findings, so that resources are not wasted on developing ineffective interventions, and (8) sharing data and creating large-scale longitudinal data repositories to ensure transparency and reproducibility of fMRI findings for education. These issues are of paramount importance to the development of optimal fMRI practices for educational applications. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFor more than a century, many teaching methods have been developed and tested, by drawing on the implications of social, cognitive, and developmental psychology for educational practice. Typically, these teaching methods have been implemented in the educational setting without accounting for the workings of the \u2018black box\u2019 of the mind ( ). There has been growing interest in how neuroscience can contribute to efficient learning in the classroom ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). For example, relevant neuroscience evidence can direct the implementation and design of efficient instruction methods, based on whether the instructions are compatible with how the brain processes information ( ;  ;  ). This requires educators to understand the neuroscience literature, and to be able to identify the most useful evidence for the educational context. A large proportion of the neuroscience literature comes from neuroimaging work, in particular findings obtained with functional MRI (fMRI). Even though fMRI is thought of as a single general tool, its application varies from one context to another: a better understanding of these applications would be useful for educators to better assess the types of fMRI that are most relevant to questions in education. \n\nThe amount of knowledge on how the brain works is growing exponentially, especially for learning-related functions, such as attention, affect, memory, decision-making and control, or for learning-related skills such as reading, writing, number processing, and problem solving ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), and for their interactions with sleep, nutrition and physical activity ( ;  ). It makes sense to capitalize on this rising knowledge to optimize learning practice, especially when deciding on competing teaching models, or when seeking tailored support for individuals with learning difficulties (e.g.  ). However, neuroscience findings are technical and complex, and they have not been framed within the context of education, so this extensive research has not yet found its impact on education. \n\nMaking sense of the wide-ranging fMRI findings, sometimes with inconsistent results across studies, can be challenging, which leads to a wider gap between neuroscience and education ( ). However, appropriate and transparent fMRI methods ( ;  ) that ensure reliable inferences ( ;  ) can be applied to educationally-relevant contexts. The apparent gap between education and neuroscience is typical of the growth process of any emerging field: evidence from neuroscience has faced resistance in other areas when evaluating its translational potential, with the classic example from clinical neuroscience. Here, we highlight the trends and best practices in fMRI, to maximize its potential implications for education; some of these practices are based on lessons learnt from clinical fMRI ( ). \n\nThe term \u2018clinical fMRI\u2019 was coined over two decades ago ( ;  ) to highlight the potential implications of fMRI findings to the clinical setting ( ). Other specialized applications such as pharmacological fMRI ( ;  ) and foetal- and newborn-fMRI ( ;  ) have also been developed for clinical applications. The potential use of clinical fMRI was initially met with resistance from clinicians, given the many potential pitfalls and limitations in making robust and reliable fMRI inferences for clinical practice ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The most frequent still-present critiques of fMRI by clinicians are six-fold: (1) fMRI is too slow, given its low temporal resolution and the inherent hemodynamic delays, (2) it only provides indirect measures (through neurovascular coupling) of neuronal activity, (3) it is preoccupied with the localization of brain \u201cblobs\u201d at arbitrary statistical thresholds with no insight into the biological mechanisms of brain function, (4) it is highly variable, with typically moderate intra-subject consistency and large between-subject variability, (5) it is notoriously difficult to conduct in vulnerable populations when participant cooperation (e.g. staying still and executing a task) is difficult, and (6) fMRI data is too complex, and it relies on sophisticated processing methods that may complicate result interpretation. Despite this, fMRI has become a useful tool in clinics, as a non-invasive option in addressing certain challenges, such as determining hemispheric dominance in patients, mapping vital brain functions before surgery, visualizing brain reorganization to support recovery, and localizing epileptic foci. \n\nThe relevance of clinical fMRI is expected to grow even more so, thanks to recent developments in cutting-edge techniques, and to a new paradigm shift in how fMRI can be applied: from standard static brain maps obtained with subtractive logic on data collected with block designs, to dynamic connectivity maps obtained while participants are doing \u2018nothing\u2019 (at rest) in the scanner. These developments are occurring at both conceptual and methodological levels (e.g.  ), and they have opened new horizons in neuroscience, including systems neuroscience, precision neuroscience, and population neuroscience. However, despite these new developments, fMRI is still not seen as a tool of choice by researchers interested in educational topics because it is (1) an expensive technique with high running costs, (2) not portable, (3) not easy to use on young school-aged participants, (4) not flexible enough for large-scale studies or when simultaneous parallel acquisitions in multiple participants are of interest, (5) limited in terms of paradigm designs that can be delivered within a typical scanning environment, and (6) restricted to looking inside the brain while the participant is lying still in a tube, which is not ideal for the typical educational context with active students moving in class. Nevertheless, the unparalleled look inside the brain that fMRI can bring, outweighs these limitations; see for instance recent review about the potential of fMRI in extending our understanding of the neural basis of memory development ( ). \n\nTo frame fMRI within the educational context, it would make sense to define first the scope of educational neuroscience (or mind, brain and education). Educational neuroscience is a transdisciplinary domain concerned with two complementary questions: how neuroscience evidence can be used to optimize leaning and teaching, and how education can enhance intellectual abilities and change the brain. In a recent systematic thematic analysis of the literature over the last 30 years, three foundational pillars were identified for the field of educational neuroscience that include application, interdisciplinarity, and translation ( ). According to some recent models, there are two pathways linking the application and translation of neuroscience to education, one direct pathway that considers the brain as a biological organ that needs to be in the optimal condition to learn, and an indirect pathway mediated by psychology as neuroscience shapes psychological theory and psychology influences education ( ). Current neuroscience evidence is dominated by findings related to the indirect pathway. To increase impact through the direct pathway, neuroscience evidence needs to progress further towards system-level mechanistic explanations of learning, and to adopt a holistic view that contextualizes learning across multiple dimensions, encompassing wellbeing, social cognition, affective processing, nutritional factors, genetic factors, sleep, and exercise. This holistic approach involves the blending of diverse disciplines, research methodologies, and paradigms, which integrates multiple levels of analysis to form a multi-level yet coherent explanation for learning, and to inform educational practice and policy ( ). Here, the focus is to frame fMRI within the evolving and transdisciplinary interface of education and neuroscience. \n\nAccordingly, there are many examples of how fMRI research has actually informed educational theories and practices, by providing, for example, biological explanations about brain-behaviour associations during learning and development, e.g. see recent work about the brain correlates of reading acquisition ( ;  ), and conceptual knowledge in STEM learning ( ). A review of this large body of literature can be found elsewhere (e.g. see  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The current review aims to address a different question: what type of fMRI is most useful for educational purposes? The answer to this question invites this \u201ceducational fMRI\u201d to embrace new developments and emerging trends that are taking place in the field of functional neuroimaging and brain mapping. Specifically, this educational fMRI should be concerned with: (1) scanning young school-aged populations, (2) investigating samples with wide variability in learning abilities and disabilities, (3) studying the brain under natural and ecological conditions, (4) multi-modal imaging of brain-behaviour associations, (5) assessing developmental or instruction-induced changes in brain function with longitudinal designs, (6) providing system-level mechanistic explanations of brain function, (7) reporting (unbiased) negative findings, and (8) sharing data and creating large-scale longitudinal databases. A comprehensive list of all available strategies and practices in the current literature is beyond the scope of this review: our goal is to highlight that many ingenious solutions have been proposed in the literature, and that the field is changing rapidly, with many strategies and solutions becoming available to researchers in the near future, despite some of the arduous challenges addressed in this review. Although the abovementioned points may also concern the application of fMRI in other fields, they are discussed here in terms of existing challenges, new opportunities and best practices for fMRI in education. \n\n### Scanning Young School-Aged Participants \n  \nEducational fMRI is mainly concerned with studying brain function in young populations, as opposed to the dominant representation of adults in the current fMRI literature. However, carrying-out fMRI in children is generally recognized as more challenging than fMRI in adults. There are many difficulties when scanning children in terms of (1) recruitment, (2) ensuring compliance and participant cooperation, (3) stringent ethical practices to ensure children\u2019s safety, (4) age-appropriate designs in task-related fMRI experiments, (5) wide differences in task performance, (6) data distortion in the presence of head motion artifacts, (7) the availability of age-appropriate atlases and customized templates for group analyses, (8) age-dependent changes in brain structure (anatomy) and hemodynamic responses, and (9) interpretation of brain activations that may change with time and expertise. Many reviews in the fields of pediatric and developmental neuroimaging have proposed very useful recommendations on how to effectively scan young participants and process data (e.g.  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). In the paragraphs below, we focus on three major issues pertaining to studying learning and development in children, using fMRI. \n\nThe first issue concerns the selection and characterization of participants. As discussed below, young participants generally display higher group heterogeneity compared to typical adult populations, due to differences in age, abilities, expertise, and to familiarity with tasks and research environment. Other issues related to comorbid conditions ( ;  ), medication status, and clinical assessment need to be taken into account ( ). In addition, individual differences in hemodynamic responses may vary with participant age ( ), with many studies reporting age-dependent changes in cerebral blood flow ( ) that could impact on the apparent differences in brain activation between groups of variable age ( ). These age-dependent differences in hemodynamic response complicate the interpretation of brain function differences across child groups of differing age (and school year). Age-appropriate flexible response functions or model-free approaches should thus be considered ( ). For multi-subject fMRI studies in young learners, high between-subject variability is expected, so it is useful to gather as much information as possible about participants (i.e. demographic and behavioral data), as this can be valuable for optimally modeling data and interpreting results. \n\nThe second issue is head motion, which has been widely discussed in previous studies. Children\u2019s head motion has the potential to systematically affect individual differences in BOLD changes and in measures of functional connectivity within and across groups ( ;  ;  ). This issue is complicated further, because in-scanner head motion also correlates with many variables of interest such as age, clinical status, cognitive ability, and symptom severity, and hence it has the potential to introduce systematic bias in brain activations and connectivity ( ). Some methodological solutions for minimizing head motion have been suggested in this active domain of research, including, for example, the application of prospective motion correction techniques ( ), robust pre-processing tools ( ), the use of screen-printed flexible MRI receive coils for better comfort ( ;  ), or size-optimized coils to increase acceleration in MRI scan acquisition in younger participants ( ). Furthermore, alternative behavioral procedures used in fMRI for children have been shown to successfully reduce anxiety, improve compliance, and minimize in-scanner head motion in young children, including pre-scan training with a mock scanner ( ;  ), watching an introductory video about what to expect before scanning ( ;  ), using head restraints that can be tolerated by children ( ), communicating with participants at regular intervals between runs of the paradigm and checking that they are comfortable ( ), watching low-demand movies during data collection of task-free fMRI data ( ), and providing real-time visual feedback about head movement ( ). These procedures should be included in fMRI experiments when scanning school-aged participants. \n\nThe third issue is task performance, which is of concern to behavioral testing in general, but it can be more tenuous under fMRI conditions. In addition to making scanning sessions as comfortable as possible for children to maintain attention to the paradigm ( ;  ), it is recommended to collect in-scanner performance by administrating active tasks rather than passive tasks to keep participants engaged, and to incorporate strategies that can deal with group performance differences ( ). To maintain engagement, the use of shorter runs is preferable to longer runs. In addition, tasks should be doable by all participants, who may differ in age and abilities; this would ensure that task demand is matched across participants. Real-time monitoring of in-scanner performance helps in ascertaining that children are engaged in the task ( ). In addition, positive reinforcement can also help in maintaining a child\u2019s motivation to \u201cdo well\u201d inside the scanner and improve amenability to the task and performance; these include social rewards such as frequent words of encouragement or tangible rewards. These procedures allow for the collection of high-quality artifact-free fMRI data. \n\n\n### Investigating Heterogeneous Cohorts With Wide Variability in (Dis)Abilities \n  \nfMRI provides a remarkable non-invasive tool to study cognition across the lifespan and in vulnerable young populations. These populations are likely to be heterogenous due to various factors that can impact a student\u2019s brain during the school years, for example, age- and learning-related changes ( ;  ;  ). One important question in education is to characterize the brain factors that can explain the wide variability in learning (dis)abilities. Learning capacity and rate vary considerably across students even within the same educational setting, with some students learning quickly while others struggle with learning. For that reason, fMRI in education should pay attention to the individual effect and go beyond the typical aggregate group inferences in fMRI that assume the \u2018average\u2019 brain can fit all sizes. Although this makes it possible to link an average brain to an average behaviour, it ignores any deviation from the mean and treats it as noise. Many fMRI studies have indeed highlighted that this framework is too reductionist, and that between-subject variability is meaningful (e.g. see a recent review by  ). Paying attention to the individual effect is useful when studying brain correlates of skills that are known to vary considerably across students, such as reading skills (for example  ;  ;  ). To fully appreciate variability in brain function, rich demographic and behavioral data are needed to better model and interpret fMRI findings, including accuracy, response times, error types, and learning rates; post-scan debriefing questionnaires can also provide valuable information. These data can be highly useful when mapping functional plasticity in childhood with fMRI ( ). \n\nVariability in brain function may result from complex genetic-by-environment interactions, and thus, may contain signatures of individual differences in abilities. For instance, previous fMRI studies have shown that variability in brain activations can be associated with individual differences in many cognitive and behavioral dimensions such as short-term memory capacity, motivational state, learning aptitude, attention shifting efficiency, cognitive flexibility, academic diligence, decision making, inhibitory efficiency during executive functions, and other higher cognitive abilities ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). To maximize the usefulness of fMRI for educators, inter-individual variability in brain function should be treated as data rather than noise ( ;  ;  ). In this context, accurate characterization of the variability in typical populations allows us to derive sound characterisations of the neuronal correlates of learning difficulties at the individual level. In other words, to understand what constitutes atypical processing, we must first understand what can be considered typical, by accurately estimating the typical range of variability in brain function. This issue is crucial to both diagnostic and prognostic purposes ( ). \n\nFurthermore, understating between-subject functional variability recognizes that a given brain function can be sustained by different processing pathways, and the activation of these pathways may vary with individual strategies and preferences ( ;  ). Individual differences in the activation of these processing pathways may yield less consistently overlapping effects in typical aggregate fMRI group statistics. However, by looking at structure or patterns in the between-subject variability, it becomes possible to decode the different processing pathways that can sustain a given function ( ). One useful framework is to model between-subject variance in activation as a mixture of different subgroups instead of assuming one single homogeneous group: the goal is to maximize similarity within subgroups at the same time as maximizing differences between subgroups. This rationale has been used previously to tease-apart different subgroups of healthy participants who used different strategies to execute the same tasks ( ;  ). Previous studies in clinical fMRI have shown the usefulness of understanding variability in brain function to explain inter-patient variability in deficit severity and recovery capacity after brain damage ( ), and ultimately, to design tailored individualized interventions and generate accurate individualized predictions ( ). fMRI for education should embrace these emerging trends to assess meaningful individual differences in development, learning, and cognition ( ;  ). \n\nIn the same way, when investigating atypical processing in children with learning difficulties such as dyslexia or dyscalculia, it is useful to acknowledge that typical and atypical processing do not always reflect a categorical distinction with clear-cut thresholds ( ); but rather, lie on a continuum of the full spectrum of learning and cognitive processing. Atypical processing itself varies (e.g. different types of learning difficulties) ( ), and characterization of these sub-types rests upon a better understanding of the variability in brain function, in particular when designing intervention procedures. Accordingly, defining fMRI-based brain markers of learning difficulties at the individual level requires optimal modeling ( ) for parsing the heterogeneity in school-aged young populations and for understanding the comorbidity between learning difficulties ( ). Last but not least, for an individual struggling with learning in one way, neuroscience can advise on the most efficient alternative way, based on the available processing pathways in that individual. This would also be powerful for developing educational applications, because educators are interested in knowing more about the wide variability in learning (dis)abilities, with the ultimate aim of personalizing teaching methods ( ). \n\n\n### Studying the Brain Under Natural and Ecological Conditions \n  \nfMRI findings that have the best translational potential are those that can be obtained under experimental conditions that are as close as possible to ecological, or real-world, contexts ( ;  ). Observing the brain while executing time-locked pseudorandomised repeated stimuli might not be the ideal context to fully understand how the brain works in daily-life. In the last decade, some studies have looked at conducting fMRI studies while participants\u2019 thoughts wander freely (i.e. resting-state fMRI), are in natural, or in uncontrolled stimulation conditions, such as sleep, mental reasoning, continuous reading, listening to narrative stories, watching movies, and more, (e.g.  ;  ;  ;  ; see a recent review by  ). This opportunity to observe the brain in natural contexts is highly appealing to educators looking for biological explanations of mental states that could hinder learning quality, such as, mind wandering, misbehavior, poor memory retention, lack of concentration, demotivation, disinterest, and fatigue, inside the classroom. Naturalistic fMRI experiments can help to ensure that the thoughts or behaviors being investigated are not perturbed or constrained by the imaging protocol, making it possible to engage neural circuits under real-life conditions ( ;  ). For example, using naturalistic protocols, it was possible to monitor brain activity while participants were playing video games ( ) or interacting in natural social scenarios ( ) using for instance hyperscanning methods (scanning more than one person simultaneously) ( ). Recently, the development of reasoning skills in children aged between 3 and 12 years was mapped with fMRI during movie watching ( ). In another example, an fMRI session under natural conditions (watching/listening of natural audio-visual movie tracks) enabled researchers to look at language processing while recording eye gaze trajectories ( ). In the context of education, these unconstrained stimulations (e.g. watching video clips) have the potential to engage a wide range of brain systems given the diverse streams of information that are typically contained in movies, which can capture dynamic real-world processing; this would ultimately provide a richer depiction of brain function at the individual level ( ;  ). Last but not least, recent studies have also shown the potential of naturalistic approaches in studying vulnerable populations, including individuals with autism spectrum disorder ( ). \n\nAnother widely studied topic in functional neuroimaging of the brain under natural conditions is mind wandering. This has potential applications for educators, since mind wandering has been linked to poor outcomes in a wide range of learning tasks ( ). Moments of mind wandering tend to disrupt memory, comprehension, participation in the classroom, and intellectual functioning ( ), in particular when the external sensory stimuli become uninteresting, repetitive, and familiar. Previous resting-state fMRI studies have shown that mind wandering involves an intricate interplay between different networks, in particular the default-mode network ( ). These fMRI findings revealed the different neuronal correlates of mind wandering, which could motivate the development of strategies to minimize mind wandering at inopportune times. This includes the need to update the sensory inflow and make it less predictable in classrooms. Interestingly, some studies have investigated the possibility of controlling and modulating mind wandering using stimulations on core regions of the default mode network ( ). \n\nAlthough fMRI textbooks still consider standard laboratory-based fMRI paradigms as a better-controlled way of looking at the brain, educational neuroscientists should consider the possibility of studying brain function with fMRI using naturalistic protocols, especially, given the recent sophistication of stimuli and data analysis methods. Some research topics of interest to education can be addressed sensibly only in real-world contexts, which emphasizes the importance of looking at the brain with naturalistic approaches. \n\n\n### Combining fMRI With Other Modalities for Multimodal Brain Mapping \n  \nWhen studying brain function, we do not have a \u2018golden technique\u2019 that addresses all the questions. There are many methods, including fMRI, each has limitations, but they can often provide complimentary information ( ). Given the multifaceted developmental changes that occur in the learner\u2019s brain at different levels (microscopic to macroscopic) and along multiple dimensions (physiology, structure and function), combining different mapping methods can provide an accurate depiction of such changes and their relationship to cognitive and behavioral growth in the preschool years and beyond ( ). Many multimodal protocols have been proposed in the literature, including the widely used combination of fMRI with EEG ( ). Here we focus on MR-based modalities that can be acquired in the same scanning environment while the participant is lying in the scanner. Concurrently acquiring information from fMRI and additional modalities can help to quantify longitudinal changes and between-subject differences in brain function, hemodynamics, and structure ( ;  ;  ). For example, changes in white matter tract microstructure are not directly seen by fMRI ( ;  ), so adding a diffusion MRI protocol during the same scanning session would provide an opportunity to assess white matter microstructure and use this information to explain changes in brain function (e.g.  ). \n\nIndeed, combining fMRI data with anatomy information is tremendously helpful for optimal modeling of brain function ( ;  ). One classic example is the development of (functional) language lateralization in school-aged children ( ;  ;  ), a question better understood if combined with information about the maturation or development of major white mater tracts such as the arcuate fasciculus ( ;  ). Recent studies have shown that atypical brain functions combined with information about alterations in brain structure explained better symptom severity in children with ADHD ( ;  ). Another example concerns the evaluation of the brain correlates of math or language learning after instruction or intervention where a combination of anatomy and function information provided more accurate explanations than functional information alone ( ;  ;  ), and proven to be useful in explaining the co-occurrence of reading and mathematical difficulties in children ( ). \n\nRecent development of non-invasive MR-based protocols has opened many opportunities to provide accurate multiscale and multimodal explanations of brain-behaviour associations, including the assessment of brain perfusion with arterial spin labelling ( ;  ), brain morphology (i.e. brain volume, sulci shape and depth, gray matter density, cortical thickness, myelin and ion density) with multiparametric quantitative MRI ( ;  ), and white matter microstructure with diffusion MRI ( ). When designing experiments with task-based fMRI paradigms in children, it is recommended if scanning time permits, to add a task-free fMRI run for resting-state network segregation, a diffusion MRI acquisition and a high-resolution anatomical scan. To manage experiment length, some of these acquisition protocols may be completed on a different visit, though acquisition time might no longer be an issue in the future with the emergence of new fast MRI acquisition schemes ( ;  ). Many analysis software packages have made the processing of multimodal MRI data accessible even for non-experts. \n\n\n### Multisession Scanning to Assess Developmental or Post-intervention Changes \n  \nFor studying brain-behaviour associations, multisession fMRI acquisitions provide a better framework to address questions that are relevant to education, in particular for questions where age and post-instruction time have a strong impact on brain function ( ;  ). Thanks to plasticity, the brain changes dramatically across development and in response to experience: for example, during learning, skill acquisition, or following intervention through behavioral protocols or brain stimulation techniques. Many fMRI studies have demonstrated the possibility to detect changes in brain function and connectivity during the development of reading skills or following intervention in children with reading difficulties ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), with the opportunity to accurately predict individual behaviour ( ). Typically, intervention-induced time-dependent changes can be characterized in cross-sectional or longitudinal fMRI studies. The latter offer better control of potential confounds or nuisance variables, but sometimes lack statistical power and can be constrained by time and funding. In contrast, cross-sectional studies can help to increase power within a reasonable time window. Researchers and educators should be aware of the limitations of each type of design when assessing intervention-induced changes in brain function ( ). \n\nOne particular example of multi-session fMRI is the investigation of changes in brain function after intervention with neuromodulation techniques, with the possibility to assess effects at the individual level ( ;  ). One class of intervention protocols, used mainly in clinical neuroscience, is brain stimulation by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate cortical excitability and hence to enhance cognition. Many studies have used tDCS to improve cognition in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, hemi-neglect, epilepsy, and aphasia ( ;  ). The application of electrical stimulations in combination with behavioral intervention can enhance recovery capacity, though studies vary considerably in patient selection, treatment-delivery protocols and outcome-measures ( ;  ). For educational purposes, tDCS has also the potential to facilitate learning, including improving verb learning ( ), word reading ( ), working memory ( ), arithmetic problem-solving ( ), and in treating children with dyslexia ( ), and autism ( ). \n\nAnother intervention protocol comes from neurofeedback procedures ( ) where participant-specific brain-related signal is used as feedback to train the participant in self-regulating brain function ( ). This protocol can induce brain plasticity by means of self-modulation of brain activity in real time. Specifically, fMRI-based neurofeedback protocols use real-time measures of brain activation as a feedback signal, and this signal can summarize regional brain activations, a multivariate pattern (i.e. decoded neurofeedback), or a connectivity pattern in a targeted network (i.e. connectivity-based neurofeedback); for review see ( ). Neurofeedback protocols have been used for diverse conditions, including ADHD ( ;  ), motor disorders ( ), and cognitive rehabilitation in stroke populations ( ;  ). Another interesting application of fMRI-based neurofeedback is in emotion regulation ( ), where self-regulation of amygdala activity helped participants to improve emotion control and reduce anxiety ( ), which is highly beneficial in the educational context given the high burden of many anxiety disorders on children functioning ( ). Before looking at the translational potential of such intervention protocols to education, their effectiveness should be assessed with randomized controlled trials and randomized controlled cross-over trials, as has been conducted for tDCS in stroke survivors ( ), tDCS for enhancing working memory capacity in healthy individuals ( ), and neurofeedback in adults with ADHD ( ). \n\nWhen using fMRI to assess longitudinal changes to brain function, either during learning or during the course of an intervention, it is important to appreciate the degree of reliability one can get from fMRI studies with children and the different limitations and challenges afforded by longitudinal designs ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). In addition, when assessing statistical significance of longitudinal changes, it is recommended to go beyond reporting values of   p   ( ), because values of   p   provide poor information about replication ( ). A   p   indicates only whether a given intervention is working or making a difference, but the effect-size provides an estimate of the size of the change or difference. Estimates of effect sizes and confidence intervals ( ) should be used to provide better estimates of the magnitude and precision of an intervention effect or of a developmental change within or between participants. It is true however that many fMRI studies do not include effect-size estimates, and interventions are frequently selected according to significant effects only, but if the magnitude (effect-size) happens to be small, then this would explain why these interventions have shown little success in clinical or educational settings. \n\nOther alternative methods for generating useful inferences in fMRI rely on Bayesian statistics. Bayesian analyses can be more informative and more flexible than traditional methods when it comes to hypothesis testing, model comparison and parameter estimation ( ,  ). For instance, Bayesian hypothesis testing allows researchers to estimate evidence and monitor its progression as real data are added, with the attractive possibility to take into account prior knowledge and to identify the most useful explanations (i.e. models) given the observed data ( ). Many practical tools have been introduced in the neuroimaging literature to make Bayesian approaches accessible to fMRI users interested in testing the presence of an effect and in model selection (see for example,  ;  ,  ;  ). Bayesian approaches can also help in optimal modeling of imaging biomarkers that may change longitudinally ( ), which can open new opportunities to examine effects that vary with age and instruction. \n\n\n### Providing System-Level Mechanistic Explanations of Brain Function \n  \nMany researchers in the field of educational neuroscience have begun to recognize that there is no single brain region or connection that is indicative of individual learning capacity ( ). Explanations of learning must therefore be expressed at the system level and be derived from mechanistic accounts, with the ultimate aim to identify the exact brain circuitry that can sustain a given mental process ( ;  ). Brain regions do not operate in isolation: identifying the set of interacting regions (i.e. a brain network) or networks that sustain a given task, provides a biologically-plausible way of explaining brain function and behaviour ( ;  ). This network approach offers a more meaningful explanation of brain function in vulnerable populations: many disorders and learning disabilities are better framed as atypicalities in brain connectivity ( ), including for example, autism ( ) and schizophrenia ( ). Making inferences at the system level opens new possibilities for understanding and treating brain disorders ( ), and in understanding brain-behaviour associations. For example, it is possible to derive useful measures or scores with task-based networks to generate individual predictions about concept knowledge in STEM learning ( ). \n\nWithin the network approach, a recent trend has been to look at brain networks during rest ( ). Resting-state networks are remarkably similar to the networks involved in task execution ( ;  ), and examining resting-state networks is very useful, because this at-rest connectivity can (1) shape task-dependent connectivity, (2) reflect, albeit not equivalently, how regions are anatomically connected, and (3) provide markers or signatures related to abilities and skills ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). This intrinsic connectivity of the brain can predict task performance ( ), recovery pathways after brain injury ( ), longitudinal changes ( ;  ), and future learning ( ). One alternative suggested in recent work is to combine both task-free and task-related connectivity to derive reliable biomarkers of learning difficulties ( ). Recent work has also shown the possibility to derive functional connectome fingerprints (i.e. \u2018connectotype\u2019) to discriminate between individuals, to accurately generate individualized predictions ( ;  ;  ), and to better understand the neurobiology of learning disorders ( ). With segregated brain networks, there is also the possibility to perform statistics on connections (termed edges), using graph theory analyses ( ), to quantify some useful connectivity metrics ( ) that can serve to discriminate between participants, tasks, and populations (e.g.  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nPerhaps most interestingly, mapping brain networks can help explain how the brain learns: by looking at network reshaping with age ( ) and learning ( ;  ;  ;  ), we are able to understand how network changes and maturation enable learning ( ;  ). Armed with these system-level inferences, individual abilities can be predicted, as shown recently in ADHD ( ), and in predicting memory performance improvement after training ( ). Recent applications of this emerging network neuroscience of learning can provide unique insights into adaptive neural processes, the attainment of knowledge, and the acquisition of new skills ( ;  ;  ;  ). Many studies have highlighted the usefulness of network analyses and the possibility to derive solid biomarkers of brain disorders ( ;  ;  ); for example for reading difficulties ( ;  ) and autism ( ). When generating explanations about both brain structure and function, it is important to keep in mind that the mapping between anatomical networks - anatomical connections, and functional networks \u2013 statistical associations between functional responses, is not necessarily a linear one-to-one mapping ( ;  ). Although both types of connectivity show some similarity, they provide complementary information about the correlates of brain disorders ( ;  ;  ), which is an important conceptual issue to keep in mind when analyzing multimodal MRI data in children. \n\nIdeally, inferences at the network or system level should encompass mechanistic models of brain function, or how connections work together, for which models of effective connectivity are needed ( ). There is a conceptual distinction between functional connectivity and effective connectivity. Functional connectivity represents the statistical associations between regional timeseries, but there is no information about the direction of the interactions; it establishes that connections, either mono- or poly-synaptic, are present but not their direction of action or causality. This type of connectivity is widely used to derive inferences at the network level as detailed above. In contrast, effective connectivity represents the causal, directed, influences between neurons or neuronal populations and thus, provides estimates for the direction of the effects between regions. Effective connectivity models are key to understanding how brain regions work together and interact to process information ( ). Recent approaches at high magnetic fields allow layer-specific activations to be detected, which can ultimately estimate the directions of causation between brain areas ( ;  ). One tool that has been widely used in fMRI in adults is dynamic causal modeling (DCM) ( ;  ;  ), which allows us to make inferences at the neuronal level through finer modeling of neurovascular coupling ( ) and to compare between different explanations of the same data. The output from DCM can be related to many behavioral outcomes, including classification between typical and atypical participants on an individual ( ) or group basis ( ;  ), and explaining and predicting behaviour through modeling ( ). Providing mechanistic explanations can provide unprecedented understating of how the brain implement a given cognitive process, as shown recently in young children across literacy development ( ). \n\nArmed with these biologically-based mechanistic accounts, it is possible to understand how typical processing is implemented in the brain and how atypical behaviour can emerge, with the potential to define efficient intervention protocols. Mechanistic explanations of brain function are needed for future development of individualized tools and interventions in education. To illustrate this rationale, we can consider the example of an acquired skill like word reading: if we have a mechanistic model that includes the brain areas that sustain reading skills, how these areas communicate together, how behavioral manipulations (e.g. word frequency, familiarity, imageability, sensory modality) modulate the interactions between different subsystems (language, executive, attentional, memory and control), how the reading system changes with expertise, and the size of typical between-subject variability in normal function, then we should be able to make predictions about how normal reading should proceed, the optimal conditions to activate the reading system, and the alternative reading pathways and the potential interventions that can be administrated to learners who struggle with reading. \n\n\n### Reporting Negative fMRI Findings \n  \nThe selective publication of positive effects is a well-known bias in the neuroimaging literature that is damaging not only to the integrity of science but also to its ingenuity in solving problems ( ). This problem may lead to the perpetuation of (false) positive effects until they become erroneously accepted as fact ( ), which leads to misrepresentation or misunderstanding by the media or the general public ( ), in particular, when it involves topics of great interest to the general public, such as education and when providing a neuroscience explanation of such effects ( ). Thus, a shift is needed to encourage the publication of null or negative results. Any translational effort to the classroom must consider the balance between what can or cannot be done and what works or does not work in brain research. Negative findings are becoming the missing piece in the neuroscience literature ( ;  ;  ) but they are needed to derive the most unbiased of scientific practices that can help to bridge the gap between neuroscience and education. Without publication of sound and relevant negative findings, the educational neuroscience literature will be skewed, and the correction of false positives difficult; this may lead to time and resources wasted on developing ineffective teaching methods that happen to be based on skewed or false brain research findings. \n\nIt is in this context that educational fMRI should emphasize the importance of replication studies. This would help to test findings in different environments (site, scanner, sequence) and samples. Replication studies can help to explain findings that are reliable and robust, along with findings that can be explained by other confounds. Another practice that can help minimize this bias in publication of positive findings and improve transparency is preregistration ( ). This entails plans and predictions being registered prior to data collection, which helps to avoid the practice of selective reporting of desirable findings based on exploratory analyses. Having a proper research data management plan will also help to improve rigor and reproducibility ( ) when using fMRI on children. Last but not least, data sharing and data repositories can also provide another solution to this issue by making data available for validating previous reports, testing new hypotheses, or aggregating with other datasets to increase statistical power. \n\nThere are many reasons why some positive findings have not always been replicated, including differences in experimental protocols ( ), different processing tools ( ), different statistical manipulations ( ;  ;  ), limited statistical power with small sample sizes ( ;  ), and high variability in fMRI responses ( ;  ). Another overlooked issue concerns how researchers interpret their findings, especially when it comes to attributing a given function or role to an activated brain region, using \u2018reverse\u2019 inference ( ). Inconsistencies are not always about the localization of effects, but in the interpretation of their function, which is usually carried out by manipulating different comparisons between conditions (contrasts, masking, conjunctions\u2026etc.). Before considering positive or negative results across studies, it is necessary to appraise how researchers have assigned functions or cognitive processes to specific brain regions. In sum, educators should not overlook replication studies and the many fMRI studies with negative results. \n\n\n### Data Sharing and fMRI Data Repositories \n  \nThe typical sample size in multi-subject task-based fMRI studies is around 16\u201330 participants, usually predefined arbitrarily or based on power analyses. This allows for inferences at the group level, but it might not be enough for optimal replicability ( ) when dealing with small population effect sizes, heterogenous groups, individual analyses, or in testing the influence of numerous demographic and behavioral variables on brain function. In that context, data repositories and databases offer an exciting opportunity for data sharing and mining, and for testing specific hypothesis with hundreds of brain scans. This would help to ensure high statistical power ( ) and to generate robust neuroscience findings while taking into account the impact of many confounds ( ). There has been a call in the neuroimaging community to support data sharing, and in response, databases have been established with the ultimate aim of depicting comprehensive models of typical and atypical brain function. The gains are not only in improving reproducibility and reliability ( ), but also in devising useful models that can predict behaviour in heterogeneous populations ( ;  ;  ;  ). Access to big data provides the opportunity to conquer the problem of a lack of normative data in assessing the range of brain function and anatomy, and this would open new avenues for neuroimaging research for educational applications. \n\nShared data can also be utilized in meta-analyses to inform future fMRI studies and motivate the development of new intervention protocols. Previous meta-analysis studies provided very useful insights about many cognitive processes (see  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), with the possibility to generate summary maps with high statistical validity using for instance activation likelihood estimation (ALE). This ALE meta-analysis takes into account the spatial uncertainty due to the inter-subject and between-template variability of fMRI foci reported from different experiments. Meta-analysis in neuroimaging can take the form of image-based or coordinate-based analysis ( ). For image-based meta-analysis, users can take advantage of the online OpenNeuro database that contains real task-based fMRI data ( ) and the Neurovault database that contains unthresholded whole-brain statistical images ( ). Another useful open tool is NeuroSynth ( ), a platform for large-scale automated synthesis of fMRI data. Armed with this tool, educators for instance can explore summary maps over thousands of studies about a concept or function of interest, which can help in generating prior knowledge or testable hypotheses for further investigations. \n\nThese neuroimaging databases have been supported by the neuroimaging community for diverse clinical applications, including research in Alzheimer disease ( ), schizophrenia ( ), and Parkinson\u2019s disease ( ). On the other hand, analogous databases on the many known learning disabilities with applications for learning and education are scarce, though some interesting initiatives exist for autism spectrum disorder ( ;  ), ADHD ( ), and dyslexia ( ). It is also interesting for researchers in educational neuroscience to be involved in initiatives that investigate educationally-relevant neurodevelopmental questions ( ;  ) in order to understand healthy brain development ( ), including The Baby Connectome Project ( ), and the Lifespan Human Connectome Project in Aging ( ). Sharing data should be encouraged in educational fMRI to respond to the increasingly recognized need for transparent and reproducible neuroscience ( ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nFunctional neuroimaging protocols are evolving continuously in their sophistication and flexibility to expand the range of research questions and inference levels. Best practice in this ever-expanding field is improving, which will ultimately help to ensure transparent and reliable neuroscience evidence and to maximize the translational potential of neuroimaging findings to education. Although some of the issues discussed here are not specific to educational fMRI, any progress in them will directly impact on the translational potential of fMRI findings to education. Educators, whether interested in conducting neuroscience experiments or searching for the best and most useful neuroscience evidence, need to pay attention to those developments. This is critical when educators are looking for novel alternative intervention methods for students struggling to learn, as the field moves from standardized intervention protocols to targeted individualized intervention strategies, comprising both behavioral therapies and non-invasive brain stimulation. Educators and neuroscientists interested in educational questions should move beyond simplistic correlational approaches, and embrace these new trends of multimodal longitudinal designs, along with the use of advanced methods that can estimate causality in brain change to derive system-level mechanistic explanations of brain-behaviour associations. This will ultimately help to better understand individual differences, heterogeneity in learner profiles, and the co-occurrence of deficits and comorbidities. The issues highlighted in this succinct review are paramount to the development of optimal fMRI practices for school-aged young individuals, and to ensure that what gets pedagogically evaluated, is top-quality fMRI evidence. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nMS helped in conceptualization, writing, and in original draft preparation.
