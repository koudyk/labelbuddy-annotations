Although widely held that these impairments arise from dopaminergic denervation of the striatum, not all executive functions are affected early on, and the underlying neural dynamics are not fully understood. In a combined longitudinal and cross\u2010sectional study, we investigated how planning deficits progress over time in the early stages of PD compared to matched healthy controls. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify accompanying neural dynamics.MethodsSeventeen PD patients and 20 healthy controls performed a parametric Tower of London task at two time points separated by \u223c3 years (baseline and follow\u2010up). We assessed task performance longitudinally in both groups; at follow\u2010up, a subset of participants (14 patients, 19 controls) performed a parallel version of the task during fMRI. We performed meta\u2010analyses to localize regions\u2010of\u2010interest (ROIs), that is, the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), inferior parietal cortex, and caudate nucleus, and performed group\u2010by\u2010task analyses and within\u2010group regression analyses of planning\u2010related neural activation. We studied task\u2010related functional connectivity of seeds in the DLPFC and caudate nucleus.ResultsPD patients, compared with controls, showed impaired task performance at both time\u2010points, while both groups showed similar performance reductions from baseline to follow\u2010up. Compared to controls, patients showed lower planning\u2010related brain activation together with decreased functional connectivity.ConclusionThese findings support the notion that planning is affected early in the PD disease course, and that this impairment in planning is accompanied by decreases in both task\u2010related brain activity and connectivity.Hum Brain Mapp 36:3703\u20133715, 2015. \u00a92015 The Authors Human Brain Mapping Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
