Moreover, the reported brain regions were sometimes inconsistent. Thus, we aimed at performing a meta\u2010analysis of the published data to identify locations consistently activated across studies, and performed a connectivity analysis to reveal how these taste processing regions connect with other brain regions. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nA meta\u2010analysis was performed based on 34 experiments, with 238 total participants in 16 studies, to establish the activation likelihood estimation (  ALE  ) of taste\u2010mediated regional activation. Meta\u2010analytic connectivity modeling (  MACM  ) and data stored in BrainMap database were employed to reveal the functional connectivity of the regions identified by   ALE   with other brain regions, across all types of experiments that caused activation among healthy subjects. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n ALE   identified nine activated clusters in bilateral anteroventral and middle dorsal insulae, bilateral thalamus and caudate, bilateral pre\u2010/postcentral gyrus, and right hippocampus. The concurrence between studies was moderate, with at best 38% of experiments contributed to the significant clusters activated by taste stimulation. Sweet taste was the predominant contributing taste.   MACM   revealed that at least 50% of the nine clusters coactivated with the middle cingulate cortex, medial frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and putamen. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nResults suggested that   fMRI   studies have reported reproducible patterns of activations across studies. The basic taste stimulations resulted in activations in a mostly bilateral network. Moreover, they were connected with cognitive and emotional relevant brain regions. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTaste is one of the most crucial basic senses that empowers humans to evaluate what foods to ingest for survival (i.e., nutrient absorption vs. potential contamination or toxicity) and enjoyment/reward (Breslin,  ). Upon stimulation of taste receptors, neural signals are generated and relayed to the primary taste cortex, which then mediates the more complex perception and behavior pertaining to taste sense integrations and associations. Examples of such associations include phantom tastes (Henkin, Levy, & Lin,  ), taste memory (Levy, Henkin, Lin, Finley, & Schellinger,  ), semantic grounding of taste words (Barr\u00f3s\u2010Loscertales et\u00a0al.,  ), synesthesia involving tastes (Jones et\u00a0al.,  ), taste enhancement by additives (Goto et\u00a0al.,  ), taste inference related to viewing food\u2010imitating products (Basso et\u00a0al.,  ), and visual food cues (van der Laan, De Ridder, Viergever, & Smeets,  ). Understanding the mechanisms behind these associations will be difficult without first mapping out the brain regions important to basic taste sensation. \n\nPast neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural correlates of various aspects of taste perception and eating behavior in the brains of healthy people, but they employed different methodologies and tastants, and utilized relatively small sample sizes (e.g., <20) that reduce their reliability (Raemaekers et\u00a0al.,  ). Furthermore, sometimes the reported locations showing activation were different between studies. Hence, a meta\u2010analysis of these papers is necessary as it pools data collected with similar parameters to identify locations with a consistent response across studies (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ). The activation likelihood estimation (ALE) is a commonly used approach to achieve this (Eickhoff, Bzdok, Laird, Kurth, & Fox,  ; Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Laird, Fox, et\u00a0al.,  ; Turkeltaub, Eden, Jones, & Zeffiro,  ; Turkeltaub et\u00a0al.,  ). It has already been used in neuroimaging meta\u2010analyses regarding taste perception (Kurth, Zilles, Fox, Laird, & Eickhoff,  ; Veldhuizen et\u00a0al.,  ) and viewing of food pictures (van der Laan et\u00a0al.,  ; van Meer, van der Laan, Adan, Viergever, & Smeets,  ). \n\nAlthough there were already meta\u2010analyses of chemosensory perception of taste, this study was conducted to address four novel aspects. First, we only included data from reports on whole\u2010brain analyses. Second, we utilized the newly recommended statistical approach for ALE, namely the cluster\u2010level family\u2010wise error (FWE) correction, which should have increased sensitivity, a better control for false\u2010positive findings and excessive contributions by individual studies (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ). Third, for each significant basic taste\u2010activated brain cluster identified in the meta\u2010analysis, we also identified the types of tastes that contributed to its activation. Fourth, we performed meta\u2010analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) which, using data across studies stored in the BrainMap database, investigates the functional connectivity of the activated regions identified in the ALE with other brain regions (Fox & Lancaster,  ; Fox et\u00a0al.,  ; Laird, Lancaster, & Fox,  ; Laird et\u00a0al.,  ). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to perform connectivity analysis for meta\u2010analytic data of taste processing. \n\nTherefore, the first purpose of this study was to revisit fMRI meta\u2010analysis of taste processing incorporating new data from recent task\u2010based fMRI studies and new statistical guidelines. This will produce a brain map showing consistent taste\u2010related activations across individual studies. The second purpose was to use MACM to reveal the patterns of connectivity between the identified taste processing regions and other brain regions. We hypothesized that the results would show significant clusters in regions frequently reported to activate upon basic taste stimulations, such as the bilateral thalamus and insula. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Literature search and selection criteria \n  \nPubMed and PsycInfo were searched (van der Laan et\u00a0al.,  ; Tang, Fellows, Small, & Dagher,  ; Veldhuizen et\u00a0al.,  ) to identify human taste functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies indexed until May 2016. The articles must contain the keywords (\u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cMRI\u201d OR \u201cBOLD\u201d) AND (\u201ctaste\u201d OR \u201cgustatory\u201d OR \u201cgustation\u201d OR \u201ctastants\u201d OR \u201cflavor\u201d) in their title or abstract (Veldhuizen et\u00a0al.,  ). \u201cBOLD\u201d stands for blood oxygenation level dependent, as fMRI studies typically detect BOLD signals. In addition, previous relevant meta\u2010analyses were identified (Kurth et\u00a0al.,  ; Veldhuizen et\u00a0al.,  ) and their selected articles entered our screening process. Studies employing positron emission tomography (PET) were not considered because PET has a lower spatial and temporal resolution than fMRI and thus the reported brain responses may not compare well (van Meer et\u00a0al.,  ; Molenberghs, Johnson, Henry, & Mattingley,  ; Sawyer,  ). The database search revealed more than 500 studies (Figure\u00a0 ), of which 371 records were unique and subsequently screened. As a first step, titles and abstracts were manually screened for their suitability. We searched for studies that were written in English and published in peer\u2010reviewed journals, employed healthy adult participants, and used liquid stimuli consisting of only basic tastes without odor or food components. We excluded food components because they might have a different texture from a control solution, might be odorous, or could trigger participants to recall their daily eating experiences (i.e., activate memory systems). Each of these could confound the brain activation attributable to chemosensory perception of taste and thus cause false positives. After this step, 101 records remained. \n  \nFlowchart of the review process. The number of publications (n) in each stage is labeled \n  \nIn the next step, the full text of the remaining 101 records was further evaluated based on an extra ordered set of five inclusion criteria listed below: \n\n  \nReported results from healthy (i.e., systemic disease free) participants. \n  \nReported results based on brain activations by taste stimuli (e.g., correlational analyses between brain response and behavioral scores were thus excluded). \n  \nReported results based on whole\u2010brain analysis. ROI analyses results were excluded because they would bias the outcome of meta\u2010analyses by ALE (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ; Laird, Fox, et\u00a0al.,  ; Turkeltaub et\u00a0al.,  ). To supplement the main meta\u2010analysis, an additional meta\u2010analysis was conducted for 14 ROI studies that fulfilled the other four inclusion criteria. \n  \nReported results in standardized stereotaxic space, that is, Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach spaces. \n  \nReported the software used for processing and analyzing fMRI data. \n  \n\nRecords needed to meet with all five criteria in order to be included in the meta\u2010analysis. Report of participants\u2019 body mass index (BMI) was initially considered as an inclusion criterion, but was rejected because many publications did not report on this; in our final inclusion of 16 studies, only five had reported on BMI, while another one only noted that they had screened for BMI (see   in the   Results   section). Thus, 85 publications did not enter the meta\u2010analysis (Supplementary File 1). Since our selection criteria were different from those of Veldhuizen et\u00a0al. ( ) and Kurth et\u00a0al. ( ), this screening process eventually removed some of their primary studies while adding some new studies. The entire screening process yielded 16 publications for the meta\u2010analysis. The coordinates of activation clusters were extracted and those reported in Talairach space were converted to MNI coordinates by Lancaster transform (Lancaster et\u00a0al.,  ). Subsequently, all MNI coordinates were entered into analyses together with the number of subjects from each experiment. \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nTo identify regions of consistent activation, we performed an ALE meta\u2010analysis. It produces a statistical parametric map, assigning an ALE value for each voxel that indicates the consistency of its activation across studies (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Turkeltaub et\u00a0al.,  ). A voxel would have a higher ALE value if more studies reported activated peaks in or close to it. \n\nThe BrainMap GingerALE 2.3.6 program (Research Imaging Institute,  ) was used to conduct the analysis. The computations were based on the revised ALE approach for coordinate\u2010based meta\u2010analysis of neuroimaging data that have been described in detail (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Turkeltaub et\u00a0al.,  ). The standardized procedures are also found in the GingerALE user manual (Research Imaging Institute,  ). In short, a map of MNI space was created for each entered study. Within the map, each voxel had a modeled activation (MA) score that reflected the probability of an activation being located there (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ). This was modeled as a three\u2010dimensional normal probability distribution centered at the input coordinates. Finally, the MA maps for all studies were unified on a voxel\u2010by\u2010voxel basis to calculate an ALE value for each voxel. \n\nOn the map of ALE values, a   p   value was calculated for each voxel based on the probability of observing an ALE value higher than the current value under the null\u2010distribution. This was achieved by randomly relocating ALE values across the volume, that is, via random permutation. In this study, the   p   values were generated by 5,000 permutations (Engelmann et\u00a0al.,  ; Laird, Fox, et\u00a0al.,  ; Laird, et\u00a0al.,  ; Witt, Laird, & Meyerand,  ). Clusters were considered active if the cluster\u2010level FWE was   p\u00a0  <  \u00a0  .05 after an initial cluster\u2010forming threshold of uncorrected   p\u00a0  <  \u00a0  .001 (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ). For this cluster\u2010level thresholding approach to ALE meta\u2010analysis, a minimum of 17 experiments should be incorporated into an independent meta\u2010analysis to control for the excessive influence from any single experiment (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nIn addition, we recorded the percentage of contributing experiments and the types of tastes involved for each cluster reported from the meta\u2010analysis to help illustrate the contributions from each basic taste. \n\n\n### Visualization of meta\u2010analytic results \n  \nThe thresholded ALE maps were overlaid onto the anatomical template, Colin27_T1_seg_MNI.nii (Holmes et\u00a0al.,  ), provided on the GingerALE website. Visualization was carried out in Mango 3.8 (Research Imaging Institute and UTHSCSA,  ). Local maxima of activation clusters were anatomically labeled with visual reference to an anatomical atlas (Mai, Majtanik, & Paxinos,  ) and cross\u2010referenced with the MNI atlas provided by Mango. \n\n\n### Meta\u2010analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) \n  \nMACM was used to identify functional coactivation patterns between the significant clusters observed using ALE and other brain regions. Briefly, we created one volume of interest (VOI) for each significant cluster. The coactivation pattern was analyzed with neuroimaging data stored in the freely available BrainMap database ( ) (Laird et\u00a0al.,  ). This approach allowed us to identify areas consistently coactivated with each VOI across all experiments indexed within the database. The database was accessed via BrainMap Sleuth 2.4.1b software (Fox & Lancaster,  ; Fox et\u00a0al.,  ; Laird, Lancaster, et\u00a0al.  ). At the time of the search, the database contained 2,994 papers reporting 14,720 experiments with 62,902 participants. Separate searches were performed for each VOI, and we limited papers to those that reported activation mapping of healthy subjects only. These coactivation data were transferred to GingerALE to perform independent ALE computations as described for the meta\u2010analysis above. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Study and participant profiles \n  \nThe data from the 16 studies included in the meta\u2010analysis involved 295 clusters of coordinates from 34 experiments utilizing 238 participants (105 males, 126 females, 7 unidentified) (Table\u00a0 ). Each study enrolled 3\u201324 participants. Participants in eight studies were predominantly right\u2010handed, while eight studies did not report handedness. Participants were mainly 20\u201340\u00a0years old. Their fasting time before brain scanning ranged from 2\u201312\u00a0h. Nine studies used SPM for processing data, six used AFNI, and one used MEDx. One AFNI study (Green & Murphy,  ) involved the use of FMRIB Software Library (FSL, another software program). Participants in 13 studies needed to swallow the taste sample liquids (Avery et\u00a0al.,  ; Bender, Veldhuizen, Meltzer, Gitelman, & Small,  ; Cerf\u2010Ducastel, Haase, & Murphy,  ; Eldeghaidy et\u00a0al.,  ; Green, Jacobson, Haase, & Murphy,  ; Green & Murphy,  ; Haase, Cerf\u2010Ducastel, Buracas, & Murphy,  ; Haase, Cerf\u2010Ducastel, & Murphy,  ; McCabe & Rolls,  ; O'Doherty, Rolls, Francis, Bowtell, & McGlone,  ; Small et\u00a0al.,  ; Veldhuizen, Bender, Constable, & Small,  ; Veldhuizen, Nachtigal, Teulings, Gitelman, & Small,  ), while those in the remaining three studies did not (Kami et\u00a0al.,  ; Nakamura et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). \n  \nStudies included in the meta\u2010analysis of this study \n    \nFive studies reported the body mass index (BMI; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) of their participants (Haase et\u00a0al.,  , 23.7 without SD; Eldeghaidy et\u00a0al.,  , 24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04; Green & Murphy,  , 25.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6; Green et\u00a0al.,  , 24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7; Avery et\u00a0al.,  , 29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06). All reported mean BMI values were below 30, the cut\u2010off threshold of obesity as defined by World Health Organization (World Health Organization,  ). It should be noted that the mean BMI values from two studies (Avery et\u00a0al.,  ; Green & Murphy,  ) were within the range of overweight (BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a025, World Health Organization,  ). Moreover, Small et\u00a0al. ( ) reported their participants were \u201cof average weight and screened for obesity and malnutrition on the basis of their body mass index\u201d. None of the studies reported the ethnic background of the participants. \n\nAuthor affiliations revealed that five studies were from a San Diego (US) research group (Cerf\u2010Ducastel et\u00a0al.,  ; Green & Murphy,  ; Green et\u00a0al.,  ; Haase et\u00a0al.,  ,  ), four from a New Haven/Chicago (US) team (Bender et\u00a0al.,  ; Small et\u00a0al.,  ; Veldhuizen et\u00a0al.,  ,  ), three from a Japanese team (Kami et\u00a0al.,  ; Nakamura et\u00a0al.,  ,  ), two from an Oxford (UK) team (McCabe & Rolls,  ; O'Doherty et\u00a0al.,  ), one from a Nottingham (UK) team (Eldeghaidy et\u00a0al.,  ), and one from an Oklahoma (US) team (Avery et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nAmong 16 studies (34 experiments), the effect of sweet taste was reported in 10 studies (14 experiments), salty taste reported in four studies (five experiments), umami taste reported in three studies (four experiments), bitter taste reported in two studies (three experiments), sour taste reported in one study (two experiments), and the combined effects reported in five studies (six experiments). Six studies reported results from multiple contrasts of basic taste stimuli (Green & Murphy,  ; Haase et\u00a0al.,  ; McCabe & Rolls,  ; Nakamura et\u00a0al.,  ; O'Doherty et\u00a0al.,  ; Small et\u00a0al.,  ). For the analyses, these results from different contrasts were treated as separate independent studies, which is a common and valid method to handle within\u2010subjects designs in ALE meta\u2010analyses using a modified ALE algorithm (Engelmann et\u00a0al.,  ; Turkeltaub et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Overall ALE meta\u2010analysis results \n  \nThe primary meta\u2010analysis pooled data across all 16 eligible studies. Results revealed nine statistically significant clusters activated by the effect of taste (Table\u00a0 ). Four of these clusters involved the insula. Both anteroventral and middle dorsal parts of the bilateral insulae were involved (Figure\u00a0 ). The other brain structures involved included the thalamus, pre\u2010/postcentral gyrus, hippocampus, and caudate. Sweet taste and taste in general contributed to every cluster reported, whereas bitter taste contributed to six, umami taste to five, salty taste to three, and sour taste to two. \n  \nLocations of supra\u2010threshold clusters activated by taste stimulations as revealed by meta\u2010analysis \n      \nLocalization of the significant activation likelihood estimation (  ALE  ) in the bilateral insulae by taste stimulations overlaid onto a standard template (Colin27_T1_seg_  MNI  .nii) in Montreal Neurological Institute (  MNI  ) space. Bilateral activation patterns were relatively symmetrical and focused on the anteroventral and middle dorsal parts. The map was generated using data from 238 individuals \n  \nResults of the supplementary meta\u2010analysis of ROI studies are described in Supplementary File 2. \n\n\n### MACM coactivation results \n  \nResults showed the VOIs located in the insula, pre\u2010/postcentral gyrus, and thalamus often coactivated with one another across all experiments indexed in the BrainMap database, whereas the caudate and hippocampus VOIs coactivated with a relatively limited number of brain regions only. In other words, the former group had a higher functional connectivity than the latter group. Brain structures that coactivated with at least 50% of the VOIs included the anterior insula, middle cingulate cortex, medial frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, thalamus, and putamen (Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nBrain regions coactivated with each volume of interest (VOI) according to meta\u2010analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) \n    \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nHere, we used the most up\u2010to\u2010date ALE algorithm publicly available, and the newest recommended statistical thresholding technique, to perform an ALE meta\u2010analysis on fMRI data related to basic taste, and to identify patterns of connectivity related to such basic taste processing. We found bilateral activation in several areas, such as the thalamus, insula, and caudate, which was consistent across the eligible studies. The percentage of included experiments contributing to each of the significant clusters was in the range of 12\u201338%. This was comparable to results from van der Laan et\u00a0al. ( , 12\u201341%) and van Meer et\u00a0al. ( , 6\u201344% except two clusters at 75%). Various factors have been proposed as potential sources of the modest concurrence of studies, including variations in experimental designs, taste stimulations, MRI machines, analytical methodology, and participant characteristics (van der Laan & Smeets,  ; van der Laan et\u00a0al.,  ; van Meer et\u00a0al.,  ). In addition, most of the significant clusters reported in this study were predominantly contributed by sweet taste, which would be expected given that most of the included studies used sweet taste stimulations. \n\n### Comparison of study inclusion with previous meta\u2010analytic studies \n  \nNine of the primary studies from Veldhuizen et\u00a0al. ( ) were excluded for being limited to ROI results only (Cerf\u2010Ducastel, Van de Moortele, MacLeod, Le Bihan, & Faurion,  ; De Araujo, Rolls, Kringelbach, McGlone, & Phillips,  ; O'Doherty, Deichmann, Critchley, & Dolan,  ; Ogawa et\u00a0al.,  ) or being PET studies (Kinomura et\u00a0al.,  ; Small, Jones\u2010Gotman, Zatorre, Petrides, & Evans,  ; Small, Jones\u2010Gotman, Zatorre, Petrides, & Evans,  ; Zald, Hagen, & Pardo,  ; Zald, Lee, Fluegel, & Pardo,  ). Note that the Cerf\u2010Ducastel et\u00a0al. ( ) study was referred to differently (Cerf\u2010Ducastel & Murphy,  ) in the bibliography of the Veldhuizen et\u00a0al. ( ) study. Similarly, 10 studies from Kurth et\u00a0al. ( ) were excluded for (1) having no results attributed specifically to basic taste stimulation (Berns, McClure, Pagnoni, & Montague,  ; De Araujo & Rolls,  ; Kobayashi et\u00a0al.,  ); (2) reporting on ROI results only (De Araujo, Rolls, et\u00a0al.,  ; Ogawa et\u00a0al.,  ; Schoenfeld et\u00a0al.,  ); (3) having no results reported in Talairach or MNI coordinates (De Araujo, Kringelbach, Rolls, & Hobden,  ; Schoenfeld et\u00a0al.,  ); (4) not identifying the analytic software used (Francis et\u00a0al.,  ); and (5) being PET studies (Zald et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). Finally, the total number of studies (  n\u00a0  =\u00a016) included in the current meta\u2010analysis was slightly larger than those two studies. \n\n\n### Comparison of activated regions with previous meta\u2010analytic studies \n  \nWe found that a number of taste\u2010activated regions were consistent with the results of previous meta\u2010analysis. These included the mediodorsal thalamus, anteroventral and middle dorsal insula, and postcentral gyrus. In addition, we found significant clusters activated by basic taste stimulations in the hippocampus and caudate that was not reported from Veldhuizen et\u00a0al. ( ). However, our study did not support the previous findings of significant clusters in the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus activated by basic taste stimulations (Veldhuizen et\u00a0al.,  ). To verify this difference, we performed an exploratory analysis on the pooled data using more lenient statistical thresholds. With a threshold of   p\u00a0  <  \u00a0  .05 with voxel\u2010wise FDR correction, we observed additional activation in right orbitofrontal cortex (peak voxel: 42, 38, \u221216; ALE value: 1.76\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 ; cluster volume: 264\u00a0mm ). With a threshold of uncorrected   p\u00a0  <  \u00a0  .001, we observed activation in anterior cingulate cortex (peak voxel: 16, 46, \u221210; ALE value: 1.41\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 ; cluster volume: 168\u00a0mm ). These observations could be accounted for by the differences in the studies included in the meta\u2010analyses. In the current meta\u2010analysis, orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus were reported in seven and 10 of the included studies, respectively. However, the reported coordinates varied across the studies and were not consistent. This might partially explain why they were not detected under more stringent statistical thresholds. \n\n\n### Reported roles of activated regions from previous neuroimaging studies \n  \nPrevious studies have suggested that different parts of the insula are responsible for processing different aspects of taste perception. For instance, Small et\u00a0al. ( ) reported that the activation in anterior insula was more related to the valence aspect of taste (i.e., whether a taste is pleasant or aversive); whereas the middle insula was more related to processing taste intensity. The significant clusters in anterior insula reported in this study were close to the clusters previously reported for valence involvement (Dalenberg, Hoogeveen, Renken, Langers, & ter Horst,  ; Jabbi, Swart, & Keysers,  ; Small et\u00a0al.,  ). Similarly, the significant clusters in middle insula reported in this study were close to the ones previously reported for processing intensity/ concentration (Kobayakawa, Saito, Gotow, & Ogawa,  ; Small et\u00a0al.,  ; Spetter, Smeets, de Graaf, & Viergever,  ). \n\nIt is known that the thalamus is a gateway through which peripheral neural signals pass through to reach the cortex. For taste processing, the thalamus was activated by detecting the presence of taste (Haase et\u00a0al.,  ; Yeung, Tanabe, Suen, & Goto,  ), differences in state of satiety (e.g., hunger vs. satiety) of participants (Haase et\u00a0al.,  ), and processing valence (Cerf\u2010Ducastel et\u00a0al.,  ). On the other hand, the precentral and postcentral gyri were involved in taste detection (Kobayashi et\u00a0al.,  ) and processing valence (Berns et\u00a0al.,  ; Calder et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nNumerous taste\u2010relevant conditions activated the insula, thalamus, and pre\u2010/postcentral gyrus, and some of the conditions activated them in groups. This was consistent with the MACM coactivation results that showed frequent coactivation (functional connectivity) among these activated clusters. From MACM results, these taste\u2010relevant VOIs also often coactivated with the middle cingulate cortex, medial frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and putamen. These regions appear to integrate taste sensation with other perceptual contexts, such as attentiveness (Lawrence, Ross, Hoffmann, Garavan, & Stein,  ), taste\u2013smell interactions (Seo et\u00a0al.,  ) and the emotional aspect of chemosensory perception (Wicker et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nThe remaining activated regions from this meta\u2010analysis were the hippocampus and caudate. The hippocampus can be activated by taste stimulations (Gautier et\u00a0al.,  ; Haase et\u00a0al.,  ), and by recall of taste stimuli (Haase et\u00a0al.,  ). The caudate, on the other hand, was responsible for processing the pleasantness and reward value of taste stimuli (Cerf\u2010Ducastel et\u00a0al.,  ; Green & Murphy,  ). \n\nEarlier studies have proposed a degree of laterality in cortical taste processing. The inferior (i.e., ventral) insula appeared to be preferably activated on the contralateral side of the dominant hand (Faurion et\u00a0al.,  ). In addition, right hemisphere dominance was previously found for taste\u2010related insula activation (Small et\u00a0al.,  ). However, both our results and those of Veldhuizen et\u00a0al. ( ) demonstrate a relatively balanced map of taste\u2010related activations. Bilateral activation is not necessarily contradictory to lateralization, as lateralized activity can represent specific aspects of taste processing, such as intensity and pleasantness (Dalenberg et\u00a0al.,  ). Future studies with a larger sample size will be needed to better describe taste\u2010related lateralization, as well as to determine the possible relationship of handedness in cortical taste processing. \n\n\n### Contribution of each taste to the clusters reported in this meta\u2010analysis \n  \nWe noted that every activated cluster reported in this study was the result of contributions by multiple tastes. Notably, sweet taste and taste in general contributed to all clusters, whereas sour taste contributed to two clusters at the thalamus and left insula only. As mentioned previously, none of the individual basic tastes had enough experiments available (  n\u00a0  =\u00a017) for a proper independent meta\u2010analysis (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ). Though the current results might suggest that each taste contributed to the activated clusters in different ratios, the differences across tastes revealed from the current results could be largely due to the unbalanced employment of tastes in the included studies. Moreover, past studies did not report on particular anatomical structures in the brain that were consistently activated by specific taste(s) only. \n\n\n### Limitations and future prospects \n  \nOne limitation of this study was the relatively small number of studies eligible after screening with stringent criteria. However, the size of our final dataset was comparable to that of Veldhuizen et\u00a0al. ( ), as well as other meta\u2010analyses with similar topics such as swallowing (S\u00f6r\u00f6s, Inamoto, & Martin,  ), smoking (Engelmann et\u00a0al.,  ), and viewing food cues (van der Laan et\u00a0al.,  ). In addition, our total of 34 experiments was double of the recommended minimum of 17 (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ) needed to control for excessive contributions by specific experiments. One further limitation was the potential for confounding factors related to swallowing of the taste liquids, which in itself activates various brain areas such as the right insula and hippocampus, bilateral pre\u2010/postcentral gyrus, and left thalamus (Little et\u00a0al.,  ; S\u00f6r\u00f6s et\u00a0al.,  ; Spetter, de Graaf, Mars, Viergever, & Smeets,  ). Most taste processing study protocols required ingestion of very small amounts of flavored liquids. However, the period of swallowing can be modeled out from the baseline during analysis. In addition, there were delivery systems designed to eliminate such need to swallow (Goto, Yeung, Suen, Fong, & Ninomiya,  ; Kami et\u00a0al.,  ). Thus, we believe swallowing\u2010related effects on the data to be minimal. \n\nWe identified three suggestions for future studies in the field. First, we noted that the five basic tastes were not yet studied in a balanced way; for example, there was only one study of pure sour taste and two of pure bitter taste in the final inclusion list of this report. Therefore, more studies on sour taste (as well as the others) are needed to reliably map the cortical representations of the individual tastes. Second, we believe future studies should provide BMI data on the study groups, which we found to go mostly unreported in our dataset (only five out of 16 included studies reported BMI). This is needed as one notable study found that people with obesity (  n\u00a0  =\u00a012) had larger brain responses to sweet and bitter tastes than normal\u2010weight (  n\u00a0  =\u00a012) people (Szalay et\u00a0al.,  ). It is still unclear if such an increase in activation exists among overweight people. Finally, we feel future studies should report the effect sizes, to allow for effect\u2010size\u2010based meta\u2010analyses that could benefit the overall analysis of the relationship between brain activation and taste stimulation. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, our results indicated that previous fMRI studies have consistently identified a pattern of activity related to basic taste stimulation including the bilateral anterior and middle insula, thalamus, caudate, pre\u2010/postcentral gyrus, and right hippocampus. Connectivity analysis suggests that the above results represent a core network of taste processing, which is functionally connected to a wider network relevant to integrating taste processing with other perceptual contexts, and includes the middle cingulate cortex, medial frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and putamen. Taken together, our meta\u2010analysis validates and confirms previous results (Veldhuizen et\u00a0al.,  ), complements those data by providing MNI\u2010based coordinates for activated areas, indicates that sweet taste was the predominant contributor to the activation results, and provides novel information on the functional connectivity necessary for basic taste sensation and its cognitive processing. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest \n  \nThe authors declare no competing financial interests. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5390838, "text_md5": "28a6e7fda540aa75675ce15f5d6c190b", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 60], "journal": [61, 72], "publication_year": [74, 78], "title": [89, 237], "keywords": [251, 342], "abstract": [355, 2331], "body": [2340, 31967]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 28413706, "doi": "10.1002/brb3.655", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5390838", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5390838"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5390838\">5390838</a>", "list_title": "PMC5390838  Basic taste processing recruits bilateral anteroventral and middle dorsal insulae: An activation likelihood estimation meta\u2010analysis of fMRI studies"}
