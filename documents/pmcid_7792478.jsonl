This effect is pronounced in clinically important brain regions and could help facilitate precision mapping of functional brain networks in healthy people and patient populations. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nThe human brain is organized into functional networks that can be mapped non-invasively using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) ( ;  ), a technique that has evolved rapidly to become one of the most commonly used tools in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Pioneering studies have used rsfMRI to reveal the topology of functional brain networks ( ;  ;  ), and their associations with discrete cognitive processes and behaviors ( ). Studies have also begun to define alterations within brain networks that are associated with psychosis ( ;  ;  ), depression ( ;  ;  ;  ), autism ( ,  ;  ;  ), and other neuropsychiatric disease states ( ;  ;  ). Promising clinical applications for rsfMRI ( ) include pre-operative mapping ( ;  ;  ), providing diagnostic and prognostic information ( ;  ;  ), and mapping targets for neuromodulation therapies ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, there are several obstacles to realizing its full clinical potential. \n\nFirst, in the majority of rsfMRI studies, data acquired from many individuals are co-registered in a common atlas space, and functional brain networks and their relationships with clinical or behavioral variables are analyzed at the group level. But recent evidence indicates that this approach can obscure individual differences in the topology (size, shape, and spatial arrangement) of functional areas and networks in cortex ( ;  ), in the cerebellum ( ), and in subcortex ( ), variability that could be both functionally meaningful and clinically useful ( ;  ;  ). Efforts to develop neuroimaging tools for diagnosing neuropsychiatric disorders or predicting treatment response could benefit by accounting for these individual differences. \n\nSecond, resting-state functional connectivity (FC) measurements would ideally exhibit high reliability at the level of individual subjects (i.e., they would be similar across repeated assessments), especially in certain clinical contexts. However, obtaining reliable FC-based measurements throughout the brain at the individual subject level typically requires large amounts of per-subject rsfMRI data (on average, 45 min in cortex [ ] and more than 90 min in the cerebellum and subcortex [ ;  ]), a practice referred to as \u201cdense sampling\u201d ( ) or \u201cprecision functional mapping\u201d ( ;  ). It is thought that artifactual within-subject variation in FC is due primarily to two factors: (1) random sampling error ( ,  ;  ,  ), in part because FC reflects low-frequency fluctuations in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may require long duration scans to assess accurately; and (2) the confounding influence of non-neurobiological artifacts, including those related to head motion ( ;  ), and participant drowsiness ( ;  ;  ). Thus, long-duration scans may improve reliability by reducing sampling variability, but they also require that the subject remain still, awake, and alert throughout, which is a significant obstacle in both research and clinical populations that may not tolerate long (or multiple) scans. Low test-retest reliability may be less of a problem for some study designs, including those aimed at identifying effects at the group level in large samples. In contrast, low test-retest reliability is a fundamental obstacle to progress in other contexts, including intervention studies involving scans obtained before and after a treatment, biomarker discovery efforts, analyses of individual differences, and studying network plasticity at the individual level. Thus, there is a pressing need for techniques that can yield more reliable FC-based measurements from experimentally and clinically tractable scan times, as explained by recent commentaries on this topic ( ;  ;  ). \n\nHere, we tested whether multi-echo (ME) fMRI could enable more rapid and reliable mapping of functional brain networks in individuals, ameliorating the need for long scans. ME fMRI sequences ( ;  ) acquire multiple images at different echo times (i.e., at repeated intervals over tens of milliseconds) per volume, in contrast to standard single-echo (SE) sequences, which acquire a single image in the same period of time. Studies have previously demonstrated that ME fMRI increases BOLD signal sensitivity ( ;  ) and can be used to identify and discard fMRI signals that cannot have originated from neurobiological activity ( ,  ,  ;  ). On first principles, either of these capabilities could enhance the reliability of FC at the individual subject level, but this possibility has not been tested directly. \n\nTo test this hypothesis, we acquired 6 h (24 \u00d7 14.5-min scans) of ME rsfMRI data from two adult participants over 9 months. We found that the reliability of FC measurements was enhanced nearly brain-wide in ME fMRI data, even when using limited amounts of per-subject data, compared to parallel analysis of SE data from the same participants and 14 densely sampled individuals from three SE datasets (n = 10 from the Midnight Scan Club [MSC] [ ]; n = 3 from the Cast-induced Plasticity [CAST] study [ ]; n = 1 from the MyConnectome [MC] project [ ;  ]). This effect was linked to at least three biophysical signal mechanisms with spatially distinct influences and replicated in two other less densely sampled participants. \n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Benchmarking the Reliability of FC Estimates in Three Independent SE Datasets \n  \nTo begin, we quantified the reliability of FC at each point in the brains of 14 individuals from three independent datasets that were repeatedly scanned using SE sequences (MSC [ ]: n = 10; 10 \u00d7 30-min scans acquired over 2 months; CAST [ ]: n = 3; 10 to 14 \u00d7 30-min scans acquired over consecutive days prior to casting of their upper right extremity; MC [ ;  ]: n = 1; 84 \u00d7 10-min scans acquired over 18 months). A summary of the sequence parameters used to collect these datasets is provided in  . The purpose of this first analysis was to obtain an independent benchmark against which our ME fMRI datasets could be evaluated. \n\nWe generated FC reliability maps for each subject using different amounts of data (ranging from 1 min to the full duration of scans in each dataset). In short, these maps index (using spatial correlation) how similar the FC of each point in the brain is when calculated using the specified amount of data from a single scan versus a large amount of independent data from the same participant. Values approaching 1 indicate better reliability. Reliability maps for example subjects from the MSC (MSC01 and MSC06 in  ), CAST (CAST01 in  ), and MC (MC01 in  ) datasets are shown in  . The two participants from the MSC dataset shown in   were selected randomly and are ranked second (MSC06) and fourth (MSC01) of the n = 10 with respect to their average brain-wide reliability value. The FC reliability maps for all 14 subjects can be viewed in  . \n\nThis analysis yielded two results. First, reliability increased with scan duration, which is consistent with findings from other studies ( ;  ;  ), but relatively few points in the brain exhibited highly reliable FC. On average, only 28% (range: 0%\u201359%) of cortex exhibited high reliability (>0.7) in MSC and CAST subjects, even when using the full 30-min scan. Second, the rate that FC became reliable varied by brain region ( ). For example, FC was fairly reliable (>0.5) in lateral prefrontal, parietal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and other association areas with only 5\u201310 min of data. Other regions, including subcortical structures (basal ganglia, thalamus); the cerebellum; and somatomotor, inferior temporal, and subgenual cingulate cortex, exhibited relatively low reliability (<0.5) on average, even with 30 min of data. This finding is consistent with recent reports that more than 1 h of per-subject data may be necessary to obtain reliable FC estimates in subcortex (basal ganglia and thalamus;  ) and in the cerebellum ( ). We note that the brain regions exhibiting relatively low reliability\u2014including the cerebellum ( ;  ), subgenual cingulate ( ;  ;  ), and basal ganglia ( ;  ;  )\u2014are implicated in psychiatry and neurology, which underscores the potential impact of tools for enhancing the reliability of FC in these areas. In summary, this first analysis replicates previous reports of scan length influencing the reliability of FC, but it also highlights how FC reliability varies significantly by brain region, which has been reported elsewhere as well ( ,  ). \n\n\n### ME fMRI Improves BOLD Signal Sensitivity and Enables the Removal of Non-BOLD Artifacts \n  \nTo test if ME fMRI could be used to obtain more reliable individual-specific FC-based measurements, we first acquired 6 h of ME fMRI data (24 \u00d7 14.5-min scans) from two individuals (referred to here as ME01 and ME02) over a period of 9 months. \n\nIn a SE fMRI sequence, like those used to collect the three independent datasets analyzed in  , images are acquired once per tissue excitation after a single fixed delay (\u201cecho time\u201d; usually 30\u201335 ms). A ME fMRI sequence acquires multiple images at different echo times spanning dozens of milliseconds, which affords two advantages. Below, we characterize these two advantages (readers are encouraged to see a review by  ] for a more complete discussion) before demonstrating how they additively enhance the reliability of FC and brain network topologies in the following sections. \n\nThe first advantage of ME fMRI is that images acquired at different echo times can be combined according to the rate of T * decay at each voxel to create an \u201coptimally combined\u201d ME (OC-ME) time series ( ). This is useful because BOLD contrast is optimal near the T * of each voxel, and combining echoes in this manner can recover signal in brain regions with a short or long T * compared to a single fixed echo. This effect is localized to specific brain regions. Consider, as an example, the subgenual cingulate ( ; purple), which has a short T * (<20 ms in both ME01 and ME02; see T * maps in  ) and exhibited relatively low reliability in  : in the OC-ME image, earlier echoes are weighted more heavily than later echoes ( ), which helps recover signal that would have otherwise been lost. Other brain regions, including portions of the basal ganglia and cerebellum, have a short T * as well (see  ). Combining echoes also dampens thermal (random) noise ( ;  ;  ), which can be a large fraction of the recorded signal ( ). Because thermal noise is embedded in all fMRI signals, this effect will occur throughout the brain. \n\nTo demonstrate the effect that combining echoes has on FC, we generated FC maps using brain regions with relatively short (subgenual cingulate;  ) and long (lateral prefrontal cortex [PFC];  ) T * values as seeds. For both subjects ME01 and ME02, maps were first created using OC-ME data from a single representative ME scan denoised using an extensively validated and commonly used algorithm for cleaning SE fMRI data (ICA-AROMA;  ;  ). For comparison, the same maps were created using the second echo (TE ) of the ME scan and a separate connectome-style (faster sampling rate; TR = 800 ms versus TR = 1355 ms) SE acquisition, both of which were preprocessed and denoised in the same fashion as the OC-ME data. Two observations are notable. First, the seed placed in the short T * subgenual cingulate exhibited stronger FC, with default mode network brain regions in OC-ME data, whereas this pattern of FC was absent in the TE  and fast-TR SE comparison datasets (see dashed white circles in   indicating weaker FC with the posterior cingulate). Second, as expected, differences among the OC-ME, TE , and SE datasets were less pronounced for the seed in lateral PFC ( ), which has a longer T * value and thus is less susceptible to signal dropout, but FC maps still appeared as if they were superimposed on static (thermal) noise. Collectively, this analysis demonstrates how ME fMRI improves BOLD signal sensitivity\u2014particularly for short T * brain regions\u2014by accounting for regional differences in the rate T * decay ( ) and dampening thermal noise. \n\nThe second advantage of ME fMRI is that how signals decay across echoes can be used during denoising to identify and remove signals that cannot have originated from neurobiological activity, including those related to head motion, heating or instability of MRI hardware, and cerebrovascular pulsatility ( ). Discarding these kinds of artifacts is desirable, in part because they can produce spurious FC estimates ( ,  ), but difficult to do in SE datasets because there is no ground truth for determining if a signal is indeed artifactual. ME fMRI provides this ground truth. For example, spatially structured signals in the OC-ME time series identified from a spatial ICA can be classified as neurobiological (and retained) or non-neurobiological (and discarded) on the basis of their signal-decay properties, an approach called ME-ICA ( ). Here, we confirmed that ME-ICA can be used to separate neurobiological and non-neurobiological signals using an instructed deep breathing task (see   for the rationale behind using the event-related approach described in  ] to establish appropriate signal separation). \n\nIn summary, we reasoned that ME fMRI has the potential to improve the reliability of FC by at least two mechanisms: (1) by enhancing BOLD signal sensitivity through the weighted combination of echoes and (2) by removing non-neurobiological artifacts through a signal-decay-based denoising technique called ME-ICA. \n\n\n### Brain-wide Improvements in Connectivity Reliability in ME fMRI Data \n  \nNext, we evaluated the reliability of FC derived from OC-ME ( ) data denoised using ME-ICA ( ) in ME01 and ME02, leveraging both advantages of ME fMRI detailed in the previous section. Reliability maps were created in the same way as was done for  . Consistent with our hypothesis, OC-ME data denoised using ME-ICA (OC-ME + ME-ICA) yielded reliable FC at nearly every point in the brain ( ; top row). Over 75% of cortex exhibited high (>0.7) reliability (82% in ME01 and 75% in ME02), compared to, on average, 28% (range: 0%\u201359%) in independent SE participants with twice as much data. Time \u00d7 reliability curves ( ) show the average reliability value (calculated separately in cortex, subcortical structures, and cerebellum) given different scan durations. Scan duration is calculated before removal of high motion volumes. Curves from the three independent SE datasets are shown as comparators. Plotting reliability values relative to the amount of data retained after motion-censoring yielded a set of similar curves (with the exception of MSC participants exhibiting especially high levels of head motion; e.g., sub-MSC08) that can be viewed in  . \n\nOne-sample t tests revealed that 10 min of OC-ME + ME-ICA data yielded FC estimates that were more reliable than those derived from 3 times as much independent SE data in cortex (  t  (12) = 5.52, p < 0.001, Cohen\u2019s d = 1.46), in the cerebellum (  t  (12) = 4.89, p = 0.001, Cohen\u2019s d = 1.38), and in subcortical structures (  t  (13) = 5.30, p = 0.001, Cohen\u2019s d = 1.10). These findings, which were replicated in two other less densely sampled individuals (\u201cME03\u201d and \u201cME04\u201d; see  ), indicate that FC reliability can be enhanced in OC-ME data when signal-decay-based denoising is used. \n\nTo better understand the unique contributions of the OC-ME procedure and signal-decay-based denoising (ME-ICA) to the enhanced reliability of FC observed in  , we created reliability maps for OC-ME and TE  data denoised using ICA-AROMA ( ;  ), which, unlike ME-ICA, does not leverage any signal-decay information. Two findings are notable. First, reliability was enhanced in OC-ME data denoised with ME-ICA, compared to ICA-AROMA, particularly in the cerebellum and basal ganglia ( ; top row versus middle row). One interpretation is that either the high density of vasculature ( ) or close proximity to ventricles ( ) renders these areas more susceptible to certain kinds of physiological artifacts (e.g., those related to cardiac pulsation) that are discarded by ME-ICA, but not ICA-AROMA. Second, the FC reliability maps (bottom row in  ) and time \u00d7 reliability curves associated with TE  + ICA-AROMA data were similar to those in the three independent SE datasets ( ). Reliability maps for all study participants can be viewed in  . \n\nA limitation of using TE  as a stand-in for SE data is that contemporary SE sequences can acquire images at faster rates than ME sequences. To help address this concern, ME01 underwent 6 h of additional scanning (24 \u00d7 14.5-min scans) with a fast-TR (800 ms) SE sequence. Direct comparison of the FC reliability map derived from fast-TR SE + ICA-AROMA data to those shown in   indicated better FC reliability brain-wide in OC-ME data when ME-ICA was used (  and  ). The fast-TR SE + ICA-AROMA time \u00d7 reliability curve (dashed purple line in  ) resembled those in the MC and CAST datasets (see  ), indicating that faster sampling rates may be beneficial. \n\nWe conducted a follow-up analysis to further understand the biophysical signal mechanisms underlying better FC reliability in OC-ME data. Specifically, we attempted to separate the effect of recovering short and long T * signals and the incidental dampening of thermal noise by shuffling the \u201coptimal\u201d weights assigned to each voxel. The rationale behind this analysis is that combining echoes in any manner can suppress thermal noise because it has no temporal or spatial structure ( ;  ), but recovering short or long T * signals requires appropriate weighting of early and late echoes in particular. Surprisingly, the reliability maps derived from OC-ME and \u201cnon-OC\u201d data were nearly identical, with the exception of vertices with a very short T * (<20 ms), which exhibited better reliability in OC-ME data than would be expected by chance after 1,000 random rotations of the T * map on a spherical expansion of each subject\u2019s cortical surface (all p values = 0.001, all   Z   scores > 6.53). This finding indicates that combining echoes according to the T * at each voxel improves the reliability of FC primarily via the incidental dampening of thermal noise (a brain-wide effect), but also by enhancing BOLD sensitivity in brain regions with a very short T * (another region-specific effect). \n\n\n### More Reliable Mapping of Individual-Specific Functional Topology in ME Data \n  \nThe analyses performed to this point in our report have focused on the reliability of correlations in BOLD fMRI signals, which are the basis for most rsfMRI studies. However, there is increasing interest in higher-level descriptions of an individual\u2019s functional brain organization, including the topology (size, shape, and spatial arrangement) of functional areas and brain networks, the latter of which is typically calculated using only the strongest of these correlations ( ,  ;  ;  ). Thus, we next tested whether ME fMRI could be used to obtain more reliable individual-specific network parcellations. We identified networks brain-wide in each individual using a widely used community detection algorithm, termed InfoMap ( ), and the precision mapping procedures developed collectively by  ,  , and  . To aid in the interpretation of the maps produced by this routine,   shows the networks identified in ME01 when using all 6 h of OC-ME + ME-ICA scans (concatenated). A seed (the gray sphere highlighted by a black arrow) placed in a fronto-parietal network patch highlights how seed FC is strongest within network. Brain networks were mapped in this manner in each of the 18 densely sampled individuals (the 4 individuals scanned using ME sequences + 14 individuals from independent SE datasets) using data from single scans and all other available scans concatenated (the latter of which serves as a kind of ground truth). Reliability was quantified using the adjusted Rand coefficient, which represents the fraction of points in the brain identified as belonging to the same network in single-scan and ground truth data (with values approaching 1 indicating better agreement after adjusting for chance). \n\nThere was a significant main effect of the OC-ME and ME-ICA procedures ( ;   F  (2,187) = 161.65, p < 0.001), such that networks defined using OC-ME + ME-ICA data (red dots in  ) were more reliable than those defined in OC-ME (green dots in  ;   t  (142) = 5.42, p < 0.001, Cohen\u2019s d = 0.82) and TE  (purple dots in  ;   t  (142) = 15.4, p < 0.001, Cohen\u2019s d = 1.57) data denoised using ICA-AROMA. Next, we compared the OC-ME and fast-TR SE data acquired from ME01 (the only participant scanned using both ME and fast-TR SE sequences). OC-ME + ME-ICA data yielded network maps that were more reliable than those defined using the SE acquisition with a faster sampling rate ( ;   t  (46) = 6.44, p < 0.001, Cohen\u2019s d = 1.36). Independent SE datasets are shown for comparison in  . Brain network topologies defined using OC-ME + ME-ICA data were significantly more reliable than those in the MSC ( ;   t  (170) = 9.21, p < 0.001, Cohen\u2019s d = 1.16) and CAST ( ;   t  (170) = 3.35, p = 0.001, Cohen\u2019s d = 0.65) participants, despite the 2-times difference in scan length. An example of functional brain networks defined using data from a single 14.5 OC-ME + ME-ICA scan and data from all other scans (5.75 h worth of scanning) is shown in  . A seed (the gray sphere highlighted by a black arrow) placed in the posterior cingulate reveals that the FC (calculated using data from the single scan) of the seed is strongest within borders of the default mode network (borders defined using the large amount of independent data). Similar visualizations were created using a variety of cortical and subcortical seeds from subsets (5 to 14.5 min; in 5-min steps) of data from three randomly selected OC-ME, fast-TR SE, and TE  scans (see  \u2013 ). Collectively, these findings indicate that more reliable descriptions of individual-specific functional brain networks can be obtained from relatively small quantities of OC-ME data when signal-decay denoising is used. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn this report, we found enhanced reliability of FC and functional brain network topology in four densely sampled individuals after echoes were combined (OC-ME) and non-neurobiological artifacts were removed using a signal-decay-based denoising approach (ME-ICA). FC reliability increased rapidly with scan duration, such that less OC-ME data was necessary to achieve the same level of reliability in three independent SE datasets (n = 14) or in fast-TR SE data collected from the same individual (see time \u00d7 reliability curves in   and  ). Several clinically important brain regions that exhibited relatively low FC reliability in SE data were more reliable in OC-ME data, especially when ME-ICA was used. The increased reliability of FC in OC-ME data was associated with more reliable descriptions of individual-specific functional brain networks (see  ). Collectively, these findings indicate that ME fMRI is well suited for rapid precision mapping of functional networks at the individual level and for tracking changes within individuals over time. These enhancements, in turn, could help facilitate clinical neuroimaging research, particularly longitudinal studies of episodic forms of psychiatric illness, and for elucidating the neurobiological basis of individual differences in cognition and behavior. \n\nThe benefits of ME sequences have been studied for over two decades ( ), beginning with seminal work by   showing that combining echoes according to the T * at each voxel increases BOLD sensitivity. For the most part, however, ME fMRI is not widely used\u2014fewer than 1% of the more than 12,000 rsfMRI studies published in the last 10 years used a ME sequence. There are likely multiple reasons for this. For example, there may be the perception that the benefits of ME fMRI are relatively modest or that it is more important to optimize spatiotemporal resolution (i.e., smaller voxels and faster sampling rates). ME fMRI has historically entailed a compromise in either full-brain coverage or spatiotemporal resolution, but recent technological advances (high-density head coils, parallel imaging [ ], and multi-band acceleration [ ]) have made this trade-off less significant. Recent studies have leveraged these advances and found that how fMRI signals decay across echoes can be used to infer if they originate from neurobiological activity or not ( ,  ), an approach that has been used to remove head-motion-related artifacts in rsfMRI scans ( ) and enhance statistical power by as much as 149% in task-based fMRI experiments ( ). By comparing FC reliability maps derived from three versions of our ME fMRI datasets with key preprocessing and denoising procedures omitted or included (see  ), our investigation found that ME fMRI can also be used to enhance FC reliability. It links this effect to three biophysical signal mechanisms with spatially distinct influences: BOLD signal sensitivity, which can be broken down further into thermal noise (a brain-wide effect) and regional differences in the rate of T * decay (a region-specific effect); and S -dependent artifacts (another region-specific effect). The extent to which ME-ICA improves FC reliability more than other denoising strategies that do not leverage signal-decay information may depend in part on how contaminated the data are by S -dependent artifacts. \n\nThe significance of our investigation is 2-fold. First, our data indicate that ME fMRI could be used to obtain more stable individual-specific FC-based measurements with less data, which has implications for studies of individual differences in functional brain organization in both health and disease ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Second, ME fMRI could be especially useful in clinical contexts, where the amount of per-subject data needed to obtain accurate assessments of FC and functional brain network topology is a significant bottleneck ( ). Importantly, some brain regions (e.g., lateral prefrontal, posterior parietal, and a subset of midline cortical areas) yielded generally reliable FC measurements (reliability values ranging from 0.5 to 0.8). However, other regions, including those implicated in neurologic and psychiatric illness (subgenual cingulate [ ;  ;  )] and cerebellum [ ]) exhibited relatively low reliability in both our SE datasets and in three independent datasets ( ). This was due in part to the fact that these brain regions are susceptible to rapid signal dropout and certain kinds of S -dependent artifacts. \n\nThe improved test-retest reliability afforded by ME fMRI is not only statistically significant, but also scientifically useful. Low test-retest reliability of FC at the individual level is a fundamental obstacle to numerous within-subject study designs, especially in clinical neuroimaging. Consider, for example, that if an investigator wanted to understand the effect of an intervention on FC in individual patients, it is desirable to minimize artifactual variation in FC within subject over time (which can be driven by various kinds of S -dependent artifacts, such as head movement levels or instabilities of MRI hardware, and removed by ME denoising), so that neurobiologically meaningful changes in FC associated with the intervention can be modeled. In other words, the enhanced reliability afforded by ME fMRI is a reduction in measurement error, which in turn should improve the power to detect brain-behavior effects in both within-subject and cross-sectional studies. ME fMRI could, therefore, help facilitate therapeutic intervention studies, biomarker discovery efforts, and longitudinal studies of functional network plasticity at the individual level. \n\nSeveral aspects of this investigation warrant careful consideration. First, our conclusions are based on data acquired from four densely sampled individuals. Performing analyses separately in each individual enabled a 4-fold replication of all our major findings. However, smaller samples can have limited generality. Mitigating this concern to some degree, we found that the reliability maps and time \u00d7 reliability curves derived from the second echo in all four ME subjects were comparable to those from 14 individuals from three independent SE datasets. It is also worth noting that head motion was relatively low for some of our study participants (see  ), suggesting that they represent a best-case scenario with respect to their ability to remain still and awake during scanning. Second, there is no empirically tested best set of parameters for a ME fMRI scan, and systematically testing different combinations of parameters was outside of the scope of the present study. ME denoising itself is an active area of research and development ( ;  ), and the algorithms used here will likely be improved upon in the near future by other investigators. Third, we are not advocating for ME fMRI scans as a panacea for the challenges inherent to obtaining accurate descriptions of an individual\u2019s functional brain organization. If time and funds permit, collecting more data will improve the reliability of FC measurements, regardless of the sequence or denoising strategy employed. However, an important caveat is that subjects are prone to drowsiness during long rsfMRI scans ( ), and fluctuations in arousal or sleep state can reduce the stability of BOLD fMRI correlations ( ;  ), which further underscores the attractiveness of obtaining reliable measurements from shorter scans, if possible. \n\nFinally, it is plain that the rate FC estimates become reliable differs across the 14 individuals in the three independent SE datasets (see transparent purple lines representing individual participants in  ) and in our 4-participant ME dataset. What factors, other than baseline levels of head motion and other S -dependent artifacts, could account for this variability? Our central hypothesis is that other factors including but not limited to certain kinds of breathing patterns ( ) (the effects of which cannot be removed using ME-ICA alone; see  ), participant drowsiness ( ), and brain volume (which should affect signal-to-noise by virtue of the physical distance between the brain and the receive coil) all contribute to individual differences in FC reliability. A larger sample of densely sampled individuals is necessary to fully address this issue. \n\nObtaining reliable FC-based measurements of individuals has, to date, required collecting large quantities of per-subject data ( ;  ;  ), which may not always be feasible for the clinical applications that have been proposed for rsfMRI, including pre-operative mapping ( ), gathering diagnostic and prognostic information ( ;  ;  ), and mapping personalized targets for neuromodulation ( ;  ;  ). Here, we demonstrate that ME fMRI enables more rapid and reliable FC-based measurements in individual subjects by increasing BOLD sensitivity and discarding fMRI signals that do not originate from neurobiological activity. By enabling more reliable measurements from shorter scan times, ME fMRI data may be especially useful for precision functional mapping of individual brains in clinical populations. \n\n\n## STAR\u2605METHODS \n  \n### RESOURCE AVAILABILITY \n  \n#### Lead contact \n  \nFurther information and requests for resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Charles J.

This dataset includes 5 h of (preprocessed, denoised, and surface registered) single-echo resting-state fMRI data (10 \u00d7 30 min scans acquired over two months) collected from ten participants aged 24\u201334 years (mean age = 29.1 \u00b1 3.3 years, 5F/5M). \n  \nThe Cast-induced Plasticity dataset ( ) was obtained from   ( ). The portion of this dataset used here included 5 to 7 h of (preprocessed, denoised, and surface registered) single-echo resting-state fMRI data (10 to 14 \u00d7 30 min scans acquired over consecutive days prior to the casting of their dominant upper extremity) collected from three healthy participants (mean age = 29 \u00b1 5.29 years, 1F/2M). Two of these participants also participated in the Midnight Scan Club experiment (CAST01 is MSC02 and CAST02 is MSC06). \n  \nThe MyConnectome dataset was obtained from the project\u2019s website ( ). This dataset included 14 h of (preprocessed, denoised, and surface registered) single-echo resting-state fMRI data (84 \u00d7 10 min scans acquired over 18 months) collected from a 45 year-old male participant. \n  \n\n\n\n### METHOD DETAILS \n  \n#### MRI image acquisition \n  \nData were acquired on a Siemens Magnetom Prisma 3T scanner at the Citigroup Biomedical Imaging Center of Weill Cornell\u2019s medical campus using a Siemens 32-channel head coil. Multi-echo, multi-band resting-state fMRI scans were collected using a T *-weighted echo-planar sequence covering the full brain (TR: 1355 ms; TE : 13.40 ms, TE : 31.11 ms, TE : 48.82 ms, TE : 66.53 ms, and TE : 84.24 ms; FOV: 216 mm; flip angle: 68\u00b0; 2.4mm isotropic; 72 slices; AP phase encoding direction; in-plane acceleration factor: 2; and multi-band acceleration factor: 6) with 640 volumes acquired per scan for a total acquisition time of 14 min and 27 s. This sequence was generously provided by the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at the University of Minnesota. Single-echo, multi-band resting-state fMRI scans (referred to in the text as the \u201cfast-TR\u201d single-echo sequence) were collected from participants ME01 and ME02 using T *-weighted echo-planar sequences covering the full brain (TR: 800 ms; TE: 30 ms; FOV: 216 mm; flip angle: 49\u00b0; 2.4mm isotropic; 72 slices; AP phase encoding direction; and multi-band acceleration factor: 6) with 1084 volumes acquired per scan for a total acquisition time of 14 min and 27 s. A pair of spin echo EPI images with opposite phase encoding directions (AP and PA) but identical geometrical parameters and echo spacing were acquired to correct spatial distortions. High-resolution (MPRAGE) T1-weighted image (TR: 2400 ms; TE: 2.28 ms; FOV: 256; flip angle: 90\u00b0, and 208 sagittal slices with a 0.8 mm thickness) and T2-weighted anatomical images (TR: 3200 ms; TE: 563 ms; FOV: 256; flip angle: 8\u00b0, and 208 sagittal slices with a 0.8 mm thickness) were acquired. Custom headcases were obtained from Caseforge ( ) for each subject to improve comfort and minimize head motion during scanning ( ). \n\n\n#### Cortical surface generation \n  \nThe average T1- and T2-weighted images were cropped to a smaller field of view (170mm in z plane), co-registered using FSL\u2019s epi_reg tool (via a boundary-based cost function with 6 DOF), and corrected for intensity inhomogeneities ( ). The T1- and T2-weighted images were co-registered to an MNI atlas (hereafter referred to as \u201cACPC\u201d alignment) using a rigid 6 DOF FLIRT transformation. Cortical surfaces were generated using Freesurfer\u2019s \u201crecon-all.v6.hires\u201d pipeline. Pial surface placement was refined using the co-registered T2-weighted image by specifying the \u201c-T2pial\u201d option. Midthickness surfaces were obtained by averaging the pial and white surfaces. Fsaverage-registered left and right hemisphere surfaces (pial, white, and midthickness) were brought into register with each other in fs_LR space ( ) and resampled to the computationally tractable resolution of 32k vertices using Connectome Workbench command line utilities. \n\n\n#### Multi-echo fMRI preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing of multi-echo data minimized spatial interpolation and volumetric smoothing while preserving the alignment of echoes. The single-band reference (SBR) images (five total; one per echo) for each scan were averaged. The resultant average SBR images were aligned, averaged, co-registered to the ACPC aligned T1-weighted anatomical image, and simultaneously corrected for spatial distortions using FSL\u2019s topup and epi_reg programs. Freesurfer\u2019s bbregister algorithm ( ) was used to refine this co-registration. For each scan, echoes were combined at each time point and a unique 6 DOF registration (one per volume) to the average SBR image was estimated using FSL\u2019s MCFLIRT tool ( ), using a 4-stage (sinc) optimization. All of these steps (co-registration to the average SBR image, ACPC alignment, and correcting for spatial distortions) were concatenated using FSL\u2019s convertwarp tool and applied as a single spline warp to individual volumes of each echo after correcting for slice time differences using FSL\u2019s slicetimer program. All denoising was performed on these preprocessed, ACPC-aligned images. \n\n\n#### Multi-echo fMRI denoising \n  \nMulti-echo ICA (ME-ICA;  ;  ,  ) denoising designed to isolate spatially structured T *- (neurobiological; \u201cBOLD-like\u201d) and S -dependent (non-neurobiological; \u201cnot BOLD-like\u201d) signals was performed using a modified version of the \u201ctedana.py\u201d workflow ( ). In short, the preprocessed, ACPC-aligned echoes were first combined according to the average rate of T * decay at each voxel across all time points by fitting the monoexponential decay, S(t) = S e *, using the \u201cnlinfit.m\u201d function in MATLAB with least-squares optimization and the initial coefficient values obtained from a linear model fit to the log of the data. From these T * values, an optimally combined multi-echo (OC-ME) time-series was obtained by combining echoes using a weighted average (W  = TE * e  *), as in  . The covariance structure of all voxel time-courses was used to identify major signals in the resultant OC-ME time-series using principal component and independent component analysis. Components were classified as either T *-dependent (and retained) or S -dependent (and discarded), primarily according to their decay properties across echoes following the decision tree described in  . We found that a global influence of respiration (a T *-dependent signal that is not of interest per se; see  ) was retained after removing S -dependent components. Mean gray matter time-series regression was subsequently performed to remove this spatially diffuse noise. Two other denoising strategies were performed. Specifically, the OC-ME and TE  time-series were also submitted to ICA-AROMA ( ), a top performing algorithm for denoising single-echo fMRI data ( ), followed by mean gray matter time-series regression. Finally, temporal masks were generated for censoring high motion time-points using a frame-wise displacement (FD;  ) threshold of 0.3 mm and a backward difference of two TRs (2 * 1.355 = 2.77 s), for an effective sampling rate comparable to historical FD measurements (approximately 2 to 4 s;  ). Prior to the FD calculation, head realignment parameters were filtered using a stopband Butterworth filter (0.2 \u2013 0.35 Hz) to attenuate the influence of respiration ( ). Concatenated filtered FD traces for each subject can be viewed in the  . \n\n\n#### Surface processing and CIFTI generation of fMRI data \n  \nThe denoised fMRI time-series was mapped to the midthickness surfaces (using the \u201c-ribbon-constrained\u201d method), combined into the Connectivity Informatics Technology Initiative (CIFTI) format, and spatially smoothed with geodesic (for surface data) and Euclidean (for volumetric data) Gaussian kernels (\u03c3 = 2.55 mm) using Connectome Workbench command line utilities ( ). Signals were normalized (z-scored). This yielded time courses representative of the entire cortical surface, subcortex (accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus), and cerebellum, but excluding non-gray matter tissue. \n\n\n#### Functional connectivity reliability maps \n  \nFunctional connectivity (FC) reliability maps were created using the following procedure. For each scan, FC maps were created using each point in the brain as a seed. This involved calculating the correlation between seed time-courses and the time-courses of all cortical vertices. FC maps were calculated using quantities of data corresponding to a range of scan durations (duration calculated before motion censoring), from 1 min to the full duration of individual scans in each dataset, in 1 min steps. Next, the same FC maps were created using all other scans (concatenated) available for that subject. This second set of FC maps served as a putative ground truth. Reliability was calculated at each seed point as the average spatial correlation (R ) between individual scan and ground truth FC maps. Thus, high and low reliability values indicate that the FC of a given vertex or voxel calculated using the specified amount of data from a single scan was similar or dissimilar to FC of that same vertex or voxel when calculated using a large amount of independent data. Correlations between pairs of vertices less than 10 mm apart in geodesic space were omitted from this calculation to avoid considering correlations due to spatial smoothing. Time \u00d7 reliability curves were obtained by averaging reliability values within different anatomical compartments (cortex, subcortical structures, cerebellum) at each scan duration. Points in the time \u00d7 reliability curves associated with single-echo and multi-echo datasets were compared statistically using the \u201cttest.m\u201d function in MATLAB (null hypothesis being that the distribution of reliability values observed in independent single-echo data has a mean equivalent to the average value observed in multi-echo data). We note that this analysis differs from previous investigations of FC reliability in densely sampled individuals ( ;  ) in two ways. First, the reliability values here are reported as R  and not Pearson correlation   r  . Second, we evaluated the reliability of vertex-to-vertex (and voxel-to-vertex) FC, not parcel-to-parcel FC. \n\n\n#### Vertex-wise mapping of functional brain networks \n  \nFunctional brain networks were mapped brain-wide in individual subjects by following procedures developed collectively in  ,  , and  . In short, a 59412 \u00d7 59412 functional connectivity matrix summarizing the temporal correlation between the time-courses of all cortical vertices was generated. Correlations between vertices with centroids less than 30 mm apart in geodesic space were set to zero. Community assignments were obtained over a range of graph densities (5% to 0.001%) using the InfoMap algorithm ( ). A template-matching procedure described in   was used to assign 1 of 15 known brain network identities to the InfoMap communities identified at each graph density. Subcortical and cerebellar voxels were then assigned to a consensus brain network in cortex using the winner-take-all procedure described in   and  . We identified \u201cintegrative\u201d vertices and voxels (those exhibiting strong FC more than one network) brain-wide by testing if functional connectivity any other network was greater than 66.7% of the correlation with the consensus network assignment. Integrative regions were visualized on the surface and in the volume using stripes (with stripe colors representing the networks present at that point). \n\n\n#### Assessing the reliability of functional brain networks \n  \nFunctional brain networks were mapped in the manner described above using data from individual scans and concatenated data from all other scans available for each subject (the latter serving as a ground truth). Reliability was defined using the adjusted Rand index (calculated using the \u201czrand.m\u201d function from the Network Community Toolbox;  ), which represents the fraction of points in the brain identified as belonging to the same network in single scan data and ground truth data after adjusting for chance. The effect of the OC-ME and ME-ICA procedures on the reliability of consensus brain network assignments within individuals was assessed using a mixed effects ANOVA model (via the \u201canovan.m\u201d function in MATLAB), with data type treated as a fixed effect and subject identity treated as a random effect. Comparisons to the three independent single-echo datasets were performed using an independent sample t test (using the \u201cttest2.m\u201d function in MATLAB). The reliability of functional brain networks derived from fast-TR single-echo and multi-echo data collected from participant ME01 was performed using a paired t test (using the \u201cttest.m\u201d function in MATLAB). \n\n\n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7792478, "text_md5": "e6a033beb985391eefb08b017417656c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 118], "journal": [119, 127], "publication_year": [129, 133], "title": [144, 215], "keywords": [229, 229], "abstract": [242, 1702], "body": [1711, 47200]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 33357444, "doi": "10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108540", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7792478", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7792478"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7792478\">7792478</a>", "list_title": "PMC7792478  Rapid Precision Functional Mapping of Individuals Using Multi-Echo fMRI"}
