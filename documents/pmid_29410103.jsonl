To synthesize this literature and overcome inconsistencies, we conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 18 whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies (541 patients, 572 healthy controls) comparing seed-based FC between OCD patients and healthy controls. In patients, the meta-analysis revealed (1) consistent hypoconnectivity within frontoparietal and salience network, and between salience, frontoparietal and default-mode network, and (2) consistent general dysconnectivity (no specific direction of connectivity change) within default-mode and frontoparietal network, as well as between frontoparietal, default-mode, and salience networks. Between-network hypoconnectivity provides evidence for the triple-network model in OCD, while aberrant within-network connectivity of frontoparietal and striatal regions supports reports of aberrant fronto-striatal circuitry. Therefore, results corroborate both models of OCD pathophysiology and link them by underlining the importance of intrinsic connectivity of frontoparietal regions which are common to both models.
