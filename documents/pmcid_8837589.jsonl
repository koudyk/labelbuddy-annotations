Meanwhile, naturalistic neuroimaging paradigms have been an emerging approach for cognitive neuroscience with high ecological validity. However, the test\u2013retest reliability of dFC in naturalistic paradigm neuroimaging is largely unknown. To address this issue, we examined the test\u2013retest reliability of dFC in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under natural viewing condition. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) of four dFC statistics including standard deviation (Std), coefficient of variation (COV), amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and excursion (Excursion) were used to measure the test\u2013retest reliability. The test\u2013retest reliability of dFC in naturalistic viewing condition was then compared with that under resting state. Our experimental results showed that: (a) Global test\u2013retest reliability of dFC was much lower than that of static functional connectivity (sFC) in both resting\u2010state and naturalistic viewing conditions; (b) Both global and local (including visual, limbic and default mode networks) test\u2013retest reliability of dFC could be significantly improved in naturalistic viewing condition compared to that in resting state; (c) There existed strong negative correlation between sFC and dFC, weak negative correlation between dFC and dFC\u2010ICC (i.e., ICC of dFC), as well as weak positive correlation between dFC\u2010ICC and sFC\u2010ICC (i.e., ICC of sFC). The present study provides novel evidence for the promotion of naturalistic paradigm fMRI in functional brain network studies. \n  \nWe examined the test\u2013retest reliability of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) in fMRI under natural viewing condition. Our experimental results showed that both global and local test\u2010retest reliability of dFC can be significantly improved in naturalistic viewing condition compared to that in resting state.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nDynamic functional connectivity (dFC) has become an important tool to probe the transient functional interactions among brain regions and their alterations in disordered brains (Allen et al.,\u00a0 ; Damaraju et al.,\u00a0 ; Fiorenzato et al.,\u00a0 ; Hutchison et al.,\u00a0 ; Liu et al.,\u00a0 ). Compared to static functional connectivity (sFC), it enriches the content of functional brain networks and provides a novel way to approach the detailed mechanisms of information processing in the brain. A number of studies have reported that dFC can provide valuable information that is inaccessible with sFC about functional network organizations (Diez\u2010Cirarda et al.,\u00a0 ; Leonardi & Van De Ville,\u00a0 ; X. Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ). For example, a series of representative functional states have been identified based on dFC and found to be associated with complex brain functions and dysfunctions of neuropsychiatric diseases (Allen et al.,\u00a0 ; Damaraju et al.,\u00a0 ; Espinoza et al.,\u00a0 ; Li et al.,\u00a0 ; X. Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nTest\u2013retest reliability generally measures the test consistency, that is, the reliability of a test measured over time (J. Wang, Han, et al.,\u00a0 ; Zuo & Xing,\u00a0 ). The test\u2013retest reliability of functional connectivity (FC) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is crucial for its applications in clinic and has been widely discussed in previous studies (Choe et al.,\u00a0 ; Guo et al.,\u00a0 ; Noble, Scheinost, & Constable,\u00a0 ; Zuo & Xing,\u00a0 ). The majority of existing FC studies in basic and translational neuroscience focuses on resting\u2010state fMRI (rs\u2010fMRI) to search for pathophysiological correlates of neurological and psychotic disorders (Tailby, Masterton, Huang, Jackson, & Abbott,\u00a0 ; X. Wang et al.,\u00a0 ; Wehrle et al.,\u00a0 ; X. Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ). However, the unconstrained resting state may increase individual variations and make it difficult to separate signals of interest from unwanted behavioral confounds (Sonkusare, Breakspear, & Guo,\u00a0 ; Tong, Hocke, & Frederick,\u00a0 ). Recently, naturalistic paradigms including dynamic videos, speech and music designed to study real\u2010life sensory experience have been proposed and gained increasing interest (Kauttonen, Hlushchuk, Jaaskelainen, & Tikka,\u00a0 ; Kuo et al.,\u00a0 ; Marshall et al.,\u00a0 ; Ren, Lv, Guo, Fang, & Guo,\u00a0 ; Sonkusare et al.,\u00a0 ). It has been demonstrated that naturalistic stimuli can achieve improved ecological validity and may be more suitable for challenging populations such as children or cognitively impaired patients (Kim, Wang, Wedell, & Shinkareva,\u00a0 ; Kuo et al.,\u00a0 ; Mandelkow, de Zwart, & Duyn,\u00a0 ). To further validate its potential in functional brain network studies, the elucidation of test\u2013retest reliability of FC in naturalistic paradigm fMRI (nfMRI) is of crucial importance. \n\nIn previous studies, the test\u2013retest reliability of sFC as well as the topological properties of functional brain networks in nfMRI have been investigated (J. Wang, Ren, et al.,\u00a0 ). Specifically, the natural movie\u2010viewing paradigm can significantly improve the test\u2013retest reliability of sFC compared to resting\u2010state. This finding encouraged the application of naturalistic paradigms in detecting longitudinal changes of disease progression for neuropsychiatric brains. However, it is still unknown whether the conclusions are still applicable for dFC (Preti, Bolton, & Van De Ville,\u00a0 ; Viviano, Raz, Yuan, & Damoiseaux,\u00a0 ; C. Zhang, Baum, Adduru, Biswal, & Michael,\u00a0 ). \n\nTo address this issue, the test\u2013retest reliability of dFC in nfMRI was investigated in the present study. A sliding\u2010window scheme was applied to derive dFC (Li et al.,\u00a0 ; X. Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ). Then intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis of dFC statistics including standard deviation (Std), coefficient of variation (COV), amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and excursion (Excursion) as recommended in previous studies was performed to measure the test\u2013retest reliability of dFC (dFC\u2010ICC) (Choe et al.,\u00a0 ; Guo et al.,\u00a0 ; J. Wang, Han, et al.,\u00a0 ; J. Wang, Ren, et al.,\u00a0 ; Zuo & Xing,\u00a0 ). Based on dFC\u2010ICC, the test\u2013retest reliability of dFC was then evaluated for region of interest (ROI) pairs (ROI\u2010level), sub\u2010networks (network\u2010level) and the whole brain (global\u2010level). It was found that nfMRI significantly increased global\u2010level dFC\u2010ICC compared to rs\u2010fMRI. Several sub\u2010networks including visual network, limbic network and default mode network showed significantly higher intranetwork dFC\u2010ICC in natural viewing condition. In addition, the global dFC\u2010ICC was lower than sFC\u2010ICC. We further discussed the relationships among sFC, dFC, sFC\u2010ICC and dFC\u2010ICC. In general, the present study demonstrated that nfMRI can improve test\u2013retest reliability of dFC compared to rs\u2010fMRI and provides complementary evidence to the potential of nfMRI in exploring functional brain networks. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Participants and experimental paradigms \n  \nTwenty healthy right\u2010handed subjects (9 males, 11 females; age from 21 to 31\u2009years) were recruited from the University of Queensland. Written informed consent was obtained for each of them. The study was approved by the human ethics research committee of the University of Queensland and conducted according to National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines. Two scanning sessions (Session I and Session II) with a time interval of three months were acquired for each participant. During each session, two conditions of fMRI data were acquired, that is, 8\u2010min resting\u2010state and 20\u2010min natural movie\u2010viewing stimulus. The resting\u2010state scan was performed prior to the movie stimulus scan. During the movie\u2010viewing scan, the participant was asked to freely view a short movie named \u201cThe Butterfly Circus\u201d (Nguyen et al.,\u00a0 ; J. Wang, Ren, et al.,\u00a0 ). All participants declared that they had not previously seen this film and were asked not to watch it outside the scan sessions before the experiment. Three subjects were excluded: one with technical problem during data recording and the other two without the second scan. Then, only 17 subjects (10 females and 7 males) were included in the study. More details can be found in previous reports (Nguyen et al.,\u00a0 ; J. Wang, Ren, et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Image acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nStructural and functional MRI images were acquired on a 3T Siemens Trio MRI scanner using a 12\u2010channel heal coil (Siemens Medical System, Germany). The scanning parameters were as follows: (a) high\u2010resolution T1\u2010weighted MPRAGE images with echo time (TE)\u00a0=\u00a02.89\u2009ms, repetition time (TR)\u00a0=\u00a04,000\u2009ms, flip angle (FA)\u00a0=\u00a09\u00b0, filed of view (FOV)\u00a0=\u00a0240\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009mm , and voxel size\u00a0=\u00a01\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm ; (b) fMRI images using a gradient\u2010echo echo\u2010planar imaging (GE\u2010EPI) sequence with TE\u00a0=\u00a030\u2009ms, TR\u00a0=\u00a02,200\u2009ms, FA\u00a0=\u00a079\u00b0, FOV\u00a0=\u00a0192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192\u2009mm , matrix\u00a0=\u00a064\u2009\u00d7\u200964, 44 axial slices, voxel size\u00a0=\u00a03\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm . Functional images were preprocessed using Statistical Parametric Mapping toolbox (SPM12) and the Data Processing Assistant for Resting\u2010State fMRI software (DPARSF) implemented in Matlab (Mathworks, USA; Chao\u2010Gan & Yu\u2010Feng,\u00a0 ). The main steps included: removing the first five volumes, slice timing, motion correction, normalization into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, spatial smoothing with a 6\u2010mm full width half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel, regressing out nuisance covariates, band\u2010pass filtering (0.01\u20130.1\u2009Hz) and detrending. More details about preprocessing can refer to previous reports (Nguyen et al.,\u00a0 ; J. Wang, Ren, et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n###  sFC   and   dFC   calculation \n  \nThe whole brain was parcellated into 200 region of interests (ROIs) according to the Craddock 200 atlas (Craddock, James, Holtzheimer 3rd, Hu, & Mayberg,\u00a0 ). Specially, these 200 ROIs can be grouped into 8 sub\u2010networks according to Yeo 7 network template (see Figure\u00a0 ): visual network (VN), somatomotor network (SMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), limbic network (LN), frontoparietal network (FPN), default mode network (DMN), and other areas (OA) those are not included in the former networks (Yeo et al.,\u00a0 ). The OA regions mainly cover parts of the cerebellum, brain stem, thalamus, and caudate. For each Craddock ROI, its network\u2010label was determined by one of the Yeo 7 functional networks that the majority of voxels within the ROI falls into. It was attributed to OA if the majority of the voxels within the ROI falls out of all the 7 brain networks. In this way, all of the 200 ROIs were grouped into 8 sub\u2010networks. \n\n####  sFC  \n  \nThe fMRI time series of all voxels within each ROI were extracted and averaged as the time series of the corresponding ROI. Then, the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between each pair of ROIs based on their time series and a 200\u2009\u00d7\u2009200 whole\u2010brain sFC matrix was generated. In this experiment, one resting\u2010state sFC matrix and one natural viewing sFC matrix was separately obtained for each subject during each session. \n\n\n####  dFC  \n  \nThe sliding\u2010window strategy was adopted to assess the dFC time series. Briefly, a rectangle time window with an interval of one TR was applied. Within each sliding window, the Pearson correlation coefficients between each pair of ROIs were calculated. Let the full duration of the fMRI time series be   T  ;   T  \u00a0=\u00a0  TR\u2009\u00d7\u2009N   where   N   is the total number of time points. Let the length of the sliding time window is   w  ;   w  \u00a0=\u00a0  TR\u2009\u00d7\u2009n   where   n   is the number of time points in the window. Then, a three\u2010dimensional 200\u2009\u00d7\u2009200\u2009\u00d7\u2009  (N \u2013 n\u2009+  \u00a01  )   whole\u2010brain FC matrix sequence, that is, dFC time series, was derived. It should be mentioned that, as suggested by Leonardi and Van De Ville, before dFC calculation a high\u2010pass filtering was previously applied to the fMRI time series that removes frequency component below 1/  w  , to avoid spurious fluctuations of FC time series when the window length was short (Leonardi & Van De Ville,\u00a0 ). Besides, with respect to the key parameter of the window length in dFC calculation, a sequence of different window sizes ranging from 10 TRs to 100 TRs in increments of 10 TRs were implemented and compared based on the dFC\u2010ICC analysis results to determine the optimal window length for our data. \n\n\n\n### Test\u2013retest reliability metrics \n  \nThe test\u2013retest reliability of sFC was measured by calculating the ICC of sFC between two sessions for each pair of ROIs and a 200\u2009\u00d7\u2009200 whole\u2010brain sFC\u2010ICC matrix can be obtained. As the test\u2013retest reliability of dFC is difficult to be achieved directly from dFC time series, a statistic that can quantify the dynamic fluctuation of the time series will be needed. In this study, four statistics including standard deviation (Std), coefficient of variation (COV), amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and excursion (Excursion) were used to derive the dFC\u2010ICC metrics (C. Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ). Similarly, one corresponding 200\u2009\u00d7\u2009200 whole\u2010brain dFC\u2010ICC matrix can be acquired for each statistic. \n\n#### Std \n  \nFor dFC time series, the Std statistic is calculated according to Equation\u00a0( ). where   r   is the Pearson correlation coefficient during the time window   t   and   is the average of the Pearson correlation coefficients across all of the sliding time windows. \n\n\n#### COV \n  \nThe COV statistic measures the percentage of variation around the arithmetic mean of the FC time series. It is defined as the ratio between the standard deviation (  Std  ) and the mean of the Pearson correlation coefficients ( ). \n\n\n#### ALFF \n  \nThe ALFF statistic was originally proposed to measure the slow fluctuations of resting\u2010state brains and found to be effective in seeking the functional abnormality in disorders (Zang et al.,\u00a0 ). Specially, through fast Fourier transform, the rs\u2010fMRI time series can be transformed into temporal frequencies and the amplitudes within the generally considered low frequency range were averaged to generate the ALFF metric. Here, as to the dFC time series, the effect of a finite window size is equivalent to applying a low\u2010pass filter to the FC time series fluctuations with a cut\u2010off frequency 1/  w   (Leonardi & Van De Ville,\u00a0 ; C. Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ). Thus, the frequency components from 0 to 1/  w   were summarized to generate the ALFF statistic for dFC time series, as shown in Equation\u00a0( ). where   n   is the number of the frequent components and   \u03b1   refers to the amplitude of the   i  \u2010th frequency component. \n\n\n#### Excursion \n  \nThe excursion statistic was provided by Zalesky et al. in 2014, aiming to measure the extent of time\u2010varying fluctuations in the time\u2010resolved dFC (Zalesky, Fornito, Cocchi, Gollo, & Breakspear,\u00a0 ). First, a time point   t   was defined as a median crossing point if the signs of   r  \u2014  median  (  r  ) and   r  \u2014  median(r)   are different, where   r   and   r   represent the Pearson correlation coefficients during the time window   t   and   t  \u2009\u2212\u20091, and   median(r)   is the median value of the coefficients across all time windows. All of the median crossing points were collected across time. A pair of consecutive crossing points   defines an excursion from the median value. The longer and larger the excursions are from the median, the greater the evidence of nonstationary behaviors. Therefore, the final statistic is designed by summating all excursions as a function of excursion length and height. where   is the length of Excursion and   indicates the height of the   k  \u2010th Excursion.   J   is the total number of all median crossing points. The exponents of   \u03b1   and   \u03b2   are used to adjust the relative weighting between the importance of long versus large excursions;   \u03b1\u2009=  \u00a0.8 and   \u03b2\u2009=  \u00a0.3 were used in this study and the influence of their settings were discussed in Section\u00a0 . \n\n\n####  ICC   analysis \n  \nHere, a one\u2010way random ANOVA model with subject as random effect was established to calculate the ICC (J. Wang, Han, et al.,\u00a0 ; C. Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ; Zuo & Xing,\u00a0 ). Through the ANOVA model, the between\u2010subject mean square (  MS  ) and within\u2010subject mean square (  MS  ) can be derived. Then, the ICC values can be calculated as follows: where   d   is the number of observations per subject (i.e.,   d  \u00a0=\u00a02 for our data). Based on sFC and dFC statistics of two scan sessions, the corresponding sFC\u2010ICC and dFC\u2010ICC (Std/COV/ALFF/Excursion) metrics were separately derived for each pair of ROIs (i.e., ROI\u2010level). The ICCs were further investigated in sub\u2010network level. Within\u2010 and between\u2010network ICCs were calculated by averaging the ROI\u2010level ICCs of all possible within\u2010 and between\u2010network ROI pairs, respectively. The global\u2010level ICC was calculated by averaging all the ROI\u2010level ICCs. \n\nGenerally, once the ICC values are calculated, they can be categorized into some intervals to indicate different reliability performance. However, Termenon, Jaillard, Delon\u2010Martin, and Achard\u00a0( ) suggested that it is more appropriate to assess the reliability by the statistical significance. Thus, the   F  \u2010statistic based on the ANOVA model was used to assess statistical significance of ICC: \n\nThe   p  \u2010value of the   F  \u2010statistic was computed using the degrees of freedom   df  1\u00a0=\u00a016 and   df  2\u00a0=\u00a017 (for one\u2010way ANOVA). In general, the larger the   F   value is, the smaller the   P  \u2010value will be and the higher ICC (i.e., better reliability) will be achieved. \n\nTo assess the statistical differences of ICC between resting\u2010state and natural viewing conditions, a paired nonparametric permutation test was conducted under the null hypothesis that the difference of ICC between two conditions is drawn from a distribution with zero mean. First, two surrogate conditions were created for Session I by concatenating random selected samples from resting\u2010state and natural viewing fMRI data, and the same selection was applied on Session II. Then, the new ICCs and their differences were computed. This process was repeated 5,000 times to generate the null distribution of ICC differences and the true differences in ICC values were compared with this null distribution (one\u2010tailed test,   p   <.025). \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nAfter preprocessing, a total of 215 volumes were included in the rs\u2010fMRI data while the natural viewing fMRI data contained 530 volumes. To reduce the influence of volume number on test\u2013retest analysis, the first 215 volumes under natural viewing condition were segmented for the FC and ICC analysis. The 200\u2009\u00d7\u2009200 sFC and dFC statistic matrices were separately derived for each subject in each session of rs\u2010fMRI and nfMRI data. Based on them, one sFC\u2010ICC matrix and four dFC\u2010ICC matrices in size of 200\u2009\u00d7\u2009200 were obtained for each condition. After removing duplicates in the symmetric matrix, 19,900 elements covering all the ROI pairs were retained for each matrix. \n\n### Determination of the window length in   dFC   evaluation \n  \nWindow length is a crucial parameter in dFC evaluation based on sliding window (Hutchison et al.,\u00a0 ). A too short or too long window will result in unreliable dFC results. In this study, the optimal window length is determined in conjunction with dFC\u2010ICC analysis results. As mentioned in Section\u00a0 , a set of different window sizes ranging from 10 TRs to 100 TRs with a step of 10 TRs were applied to assess dFC time series. The dFC statistics of Std, COV, ALFF, and Excursion were derived and then the corresponding dFC\u2010ICC values across each pair of ROIs, that is, ROI\u2010level dFC\u2010ICC, were calculated for rs\u2010fMRI and nfMRI. Furthermore, the whole\u2010brain average dFC\u2010ICC, that is, global\u2010level dFC\u2010ICC, based on the four dFC statistics were computed by averaging the dFC\u2010ICC values of all the 19,900 ROI pairs and visualized in Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nThe variations of the global\u2010level dFC\u2010ICC along with different time windows (10 TRs, 20 TRs, 30 TRs, \u2026, 100 TRs) based on the four dFC statistics of Std, COV, ALFF, and Excursion: (a) Resting state; (b) Natural viewing \n  \nIt can be observed in Figure\u00a0  that the global\u2010level dFC\u2010ICC based on Std, ALFF and Excursion exhibited similar variations in both conditions as the time window length increased. For resting state, the ICC was maximized at the 30\u2010TR\u2010length window for Std. As to the ALFF and Excursion statistics, the second highest dFC\u2010ICC was achieved at 30\u2010TR\u2010length window with a subtle difference from the peak (20\u2010TR\u2010length window). For natural viewing condition, the peak values of the ICC curves emerged at window size of 10 TRs and the second highest dFC\u2010ICC values were achieved at window size of 30 TRs for the three statistics of Std, ALFF, and Excursion. However, the window length of 10 TRs is not an optimal option for dFC evaluation, as a too short window may introduce more fake dynamics that are not belong to the real dFC content and then further influence the accuracy of ICC analysis (Hutchison et al.,\u00a0 ; Zalesky & Breakspear,\u00a0 ). Moreover, the peak dFC\u2010ICC value was obtained at window size of 30 TRs for both conditions in COV statistic. Thus, the length of the window was set as 30 TRs in further experiments. \n\n\n### The   dFC   statistic results for resting state and natural viewing \n  \nThe dFC\u2010ICC matrices and their differences between natural viewing and resting state using the four dFC statistics were compared, as shown in  . Similar spatial patterns of dFC\u2010ICC were observed in all the four dFC statistics. The Excursion statistic was with the highest test\u2013retest reliability measure for both resting\u2010state and natural viewing conditions. This observation is in line with a previous study, which demonstrates that the Excursion statistic performs better in maximizing reliability as well as maintaining individual differences in resting\u2010state fMRI (C. Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ). Therefore, the Excursion statistic was selected as a single metric to derive ICC measures for the following dFC\u2010ICC analysis. \n\nFor each session of rs\u2010fMRI and nfMRI, the dFC time series and the corresponding dFC Excursion results were calculated using the 30\u2010TR\u2010length sliding window and those of one randomly selected subject were shown in  . The group average Excursion matrices of each session for both conditions were shown in Figure\u00a0 . As mentioned in Section\u00a0 , the 200 Craddock ROIs were grouped into 8 sub\u2010networks, that is, VN (1), SMN (2), DAN (3), VAN (4), LN (5), FPN (6), DMN (7), and OA (8) (Yeo et al.,\u00a0 ). It can be seen that there exists similar excursion pattern in rs\u2010fMRI and nfMRI, that is, low intranetwork and high internetwork Excursion, indicating less FC dynamics within each sub\u2010network than between sub\u2010networks. The distribution of Excursion across all of the ROI pairs for each session of resting state (in cyan) and natural viewing (in magenta) was drawn in Figure\u00a0 . As to the group difference between resting state and natural viewing in Figure\u00a0 , paired   t  \u2010test was performed separately for each session (one\u2010tailed test,   p   <.025). For Session I, the intranetwork Excursion tend to be higher in natural viewing than resting state in SMN (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.023, uncorrected) and significant decreased excursion between OA and other subnetworks including VN (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.012, uncorrected), SMN (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.016, uncorrected), DAN (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.004, uncorrected), LN (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.013, uncorrected), and DMN (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.016, uncorrected); while for Session II, significant higher Excursion were found within SMN (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.009, uncorrected) and DMN (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.007, uncorrected), and between LN and DMN (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.005, uncorrected) for natural viewing. However, after multiple comparison correction across all the sub\u2010network pairs using false discovery rate (FDR) method, none of the above differences were statistically significant (corrected   p   >.025). Furthermore, the whole\u2010brain average Excursion for each subject was calculated and also compared between two conditions; no significant differences were found between them for both sessions (two\u2010tailed   t  \u2010test,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.635). \n  \nThe Excursion of dFC.

The average dFC\u2010ICC results of each sub\u2010network (i.e., intranetwork ICC, corresponding to the diagonal boxes in the former two matrices) were also shown in the third column of Figure\u00a0 . The distribution of dFC\u2010ICC values across all of the ROI pairs for each condition was provided in  . For each pair of ROIs, the   F  \u2010statistic was computed during ICC analysis based on one\u2010way ANOVA model. As shown in Figure\u00a0 , a total of 5,380 out of 19,900 natural viewing ROI pairs had   p  \u2010values lower than .05 and 539 remained significant after multiple comparison correction across all the ROI pairs using FDR correction method (corrected   p   <.05). As a contrast, for resting state, 4,372 out of 19,900 ROI pairs showed significant   p  \u2010values (  p   <.05) and only 264 pairs were retained after FDR correction (corrected   p   <.05). \n  \nThe dFC\u2010ICC and statistical results. (a) The first and second columns were the Excursion\u2010based dFC\u2010ICC matrices of resting\u2010state and natural viewing conditions. The last column showed the average dFC\u2010ICC results of 8 sub\u2010networks (i.e., intranetwork ICC) for both conditions. (b) The statistical results of dFC\u2010ICC based on one\u2010way ANOVA model. The first and second columns showed the ROI pairs with significant ICC results in red color (  p   <.05). The last column showed the percentages of significant ICC values in each sub\u2010network for both conditions. (c) The first column was the dFC\u2010ICC difference matrix, that is, natural viewing (NV) dFC\u2010ICC minus resting state (RS) dFC\u2010ICC. The second column showed the paired permutation test of the dFC\u2010ICC difference (NV\u2009\u2212\u2009RS) with gray dashed lines indicating 95% CIs. The last column showed the   p   values of each intranetwork average dFC\u2010ICC difference between two conditions after FDR correction across the sub\u2010networks \n  \nAs to the intranetwork ICC, it can be observed from Figure\u00a0  that the natural viewing condition had more significant ICC in VN, LN, DMN, and OA (in magenta dashed circle) while resting state exhibited more significant ICC occupations in SMN and DAN (in navy blue dashed circle). Their difference was small in VAN and FPN. Besides, natural viewing showed a relatively balanced percentage of significant ICC across each sub\u2010network compared with resting state (the third column of Figure\u00a0 ). \n\n\n#### Statistical comparison of   dFC\u2010ICC   between resting state and natural viewing \n  \nAs shown in Figure\u00a0 , the global\u2010level dFC\u2010ICC values of resting state and natural viewing were .180 and .225, respectively, that is, an increment of .045 for natural viewing compared with resting state. As for network\u2010level, the natural viewing condition showed higher intranetwork dFC\u2010ICC values in VN, LN, DMN, and OA, but decreased dFC\u2010ICC values in SMN and DAN relative to resting state, as visualized in the last column of Figure\u00a0 . The resting\u2010state dFC\u2010ICC differed sharply among sub\u2010networks, ranging from the highest value of .200 (SMN) to the lowest value of .058 (OA). By contrast, the natural viewing condition had a relatively balanced ICC distribution across each sub\u2010network, varying from the highest value of .189 (FPN) to the lowest value of .113 (LN). The dFC\u2010ICC values of the other six sub\u2010networks for natural viewing were all larger than .140. Furthermore, the dFC\u2010ICC differences of each ROI pair (i.e., ROI\u2010level) between natural viewing and resting state were also visualized in the first column of Figure\u00a0 . The distributions of dFC\u2010ICC for each condition and the dFC\u2010ICC differences between them across all of the ROI pairs were visualized in  . \n\nTo validate the statistical significance of between\u2010condition dFC\u2010ICC difference, paired permutation tests were conducted along ROI\u2010level, network\u2010level and global\u2010level. The global\u2010level dFC\u2010ICC of natural viewing was significantly larger than resting state (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.001). When comparing the intranetwork dFC\u2010ICC differences, natural viewing showed significant increased dFC\u2010ICC in VN (  p   <.001, uncorrected), LN (  p   <.001, uncorrected), DMN (  p   <.001, uncorrected), and OA (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.010, uncorrected) and decreased dFC\u2010ICC in SMN (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.001, uncorrected) than resting state. After FDR correction, all of the above differences remained significant (Figure\u00a0 ). As to the ROI\u2010level, a total of 3,104 ROI pairs showed significantly increased dFC\u2010ICC and 2,042 pairs showed significantly decreased dFC\u2010ICC values for natural viewing than resting state (paired permutation test, uncorrected   p   <.025). After FDR correction, 1,187 pairs out of 3,104 and 641 pairs out of 2,042 remained significant (corrected   p   <.025, see   for more details). \n\n\n\n### Comparison between   sFC\u2010ICC   and   dFC\u2010ICC   for resting state and natural viewing \n  \nA previous study has reported that natural viewing condition increased the test\u2013retest reliability of topological properties of sFC compared to resting state (J. Wang, Ren, et al.,\u00a0 ). In this study, the difference between sFC and dFC was further investigated. Both conditions exhibited relatively higher sFC\u2010ICC than dFC\u2010ICC. Specially, the difference results of sFC\u2010ICC minus dFC\u2010ICC across all the ROI pairs and sub\u2010network pairs were shown in Figure\u00a0 . It can be seen that for most of ROI pairs, the sFC\u2010ICC exceeded the dFC\u2010ICC in each condition; their differences were larger for natural viewing, that is, more red points in the difference matrix. Moreover, for network\u2010level, all of the sFC\u2010ICC surpassed the dFC\u2010ICC (Figure\u00a0 ). The difference value of sFC\u2010ICC minus dFC\u2010ICC across ROI pairs ranged from \u22120.914 to 1.324 for resting state and from \u22120.770 to 1.339 for natural viewing. According to the sub\u2010network difference results in Figure\u00a0 , the intranetwork differences between sFC\u2010ICC and dFC\u2010ICC were much lower than internetwork differences for both conditions. \n  \nThe visualization of sFC\u2010ICC minus dFC\u2010ICC for resting state and natural viewing: (a) across all the ROI pairs; (b) across all the sub\u2010network pairs \n  \n\n### Relationships between   sFC  ,   dFC,   and their   ICCs   for resting state and natural viewing \n  \nIn this part, the relationships between sFC, sFC\u2010ICC, dFC (i.e., dFC Excursion statistic) and dFC\u2010ICC were explored for both conditions. First, the sFC and dFC Excursion matrices were averaged along subjects and sessions. Then the Pearson correlation coefficients between sFC and sFC\u2010ICC, dFC and dFC\u2010ICC, sFC and dFC, sFC\u2010ICC and dFC\u2010ICC for each condition were computed and summarized in Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nThe associations between sFC, sFC\u2010ICC, dFC (Excursion) and dFC\u2010ICC matrices as heat maps for all ROI pairs with Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding   p   values: (a) Resting state (b) Natural viewing \n  \nFor both conditions, significant strong negative correlations were observed between sFC and dFC (resting state:   r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.898,   p   <.001, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[\u22120.900, \u22120.895]; natural viewing:   r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.896,   p   <.001, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[\u22120.898, \u22120.893]) while significant weak positive correlations existed between sFC\u2010ICC and dFC\u2010ICC (resting state:   r  \u00a0=\u00a0.377,   p   <.001, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[0.365, 0.389]; natural viewing   r  \u00a0=\u00a0.291,   p   <.001, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[0.278, 0.303]). Meanwhile, significant weak negative correlations were found between dFC and dFC\u2010ICC for each condition (resting state:   r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.281,   p   <.001, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[\u22120.294, \u22120.268]; natural viewing:   r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.320,   p   <.001, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[\u22120.332, \u22120.307]). As to the relationship between sFC and sFC\u2010ICC, the correlation was very low for resting state (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0.142,   p   <.001, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[0.128, 0.155]) while no significant correlation was found in natural viewing condition (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0.006,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.406). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \n###  DFC\u2010ICC   as a function of the number of   fMRI   volumes \n  \nAs mentioned above, the first 215 volumes of nfMRI data were segmented for dFC and dFC\u2010ICC analysis to match with rs\u2010fMRI. When the whole scan data with 530 volumes was selected for dFC evaluation and ICC analysis, the global\u2010level dFC\u2010ICC values is 0.330 for 30\u2010TR\u2010length time window, larger than the 215 volumes of both conditions. Furthermore, the influence of the involved volumes in dFC\u2010ICC analysis was investigated based on rs\u2010fMRI and nfMRI, respectively. With an increment of 5 volumes from 100 volumes to 215 volumes for rs\u2010fMRI and to 530 volumes for nfMRI involved in dFC analysis, the global\u2010level dFC\u2010ICC results were summarized in Figure\u00a0 . With the number of volumes as the independent factor and dFC\u2010ICC as the dependent factor, a linear regression model was estimated for rs\u2010fMRI (  R  \u00a0=\u00a0.985,   p   <.001) as well as for nfMRI (  R  \u00a0=\u00a0.928,   p   <.001), suggesting that dFC\u2010ICC was in strong positive relation with the volume number for both conditions. In other words, a longer scan period can achieve relatively better test\u2013retest performance for dFC analysis. \n  \nThe dFC\u2010ICC variations along with the involved number of volumes in dFC analysis with an increment of 5 volumes (in blue). A linear regression model was estimated with dFC\u2010ICC as the dependent factor and the number of volumes as the independent factor (red line) for resting\u2010state (a) and natural viewing (b) conditions, respectively \n  \n\n### The impact of window type in   dFC   evaluation \n  \nIn the present study, a rectangle time window was applied in sliding window dFC estimation. However, various types of windows have been proposed to alleviate the effect of sudden changes associated with the edges of the rectangle window (Allen et al.,\u00a0 ; Mokhtari, Akhlaghi, Simpson, Wu, & Laurienti,\u00a0 ). Here, two classical windows, that is, Gaussian window and hamming window, were applied to derive dFC and dFC\u2010ICC based on the Excursion statistic. The interval of sliding window is 1 TR and the window length was set as 45 TR, that is, 1.5 times of the length of rectangle window (Mokhtari et al.,\u00a0 ). The dFC\u2010ICC matrices and their differences between two conditions using the three types of windows were shown in  . All the three types of windows resulted in similar spatial patterns of dFC\u2010ICC for both resting state and naturalistic viewing conditions. Furthermore, natural viewing condition increases both global and local dFC\u2010ICC compared to resting state no matter what type of window is applied. \n\n\n### The influence of excursion parameters on   dFC\u2010ICC  \n  \nAccording to Equation\u00a0 , two parameters   \u03b1   and   \u03b2   are involved in dFC Excursion calculation. In this section, the influence of the two parameter values on dFC\u2010ICC results are summarized in Figure\u00a0 . Using different parameter combinations of   \u03b1   in (.1, .2, .3, \u2026, 1) and   \u03b2   in (.1, .2, .3, \u2026, 1), the corresponding global\u2010level dFC\u2010ICC results were recorded and visualized in Figure\u00a0 . It can be found that the highest dFC\u2010ICC was achieved using the combination of   \u03b1\u2009=  \u00a0.8 and   \u03b2\u2009=  \u00a0.3 for both conditions. Thus, this parameter combination was adopted in our study. Besides, for the majority of parameter combinations, the natural viewing condition had relatively higher dFC\u2010ICC values than resting state (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nThe global\u2010level dFC\u2010ICC results using different parameter combinations of   \u03b1   in (.1, .2, .3, \u2026, 1) and   \u03b2   in (.1, .2, .3, \u2026, 1) in Excursion estimation: (a) Resting state; (b) Natural viewing; (c) Natural viewing (NV) minus resting state (RS) \n  \n\n### The difference between   dFC\u2010ICC   and   sFC\u2010ICC  \n  \nAccording to Figure\u00a0 , most of the ROI pairs showed higher sFC\u2010ICC than dFC\u2010ICC and the global\u2010level sFC\u2010ICC is much higher than the global\u2010level dFC\u2010ICC for both resting\u2010state and natural viewing conditions (J. Wang, Ren, et al.,\u00a0 ). Specially, a total of 2,744 (13.8%) natural viewing ROI pairs showed high dFC\u2010ICC (larger than .5) and 2,193 (11.0%) for resting state, while the number of high sFC\u2010ICC was 10,353 (52.0%) for natural viewing and 6,522 (32.8%) for resting sate. These results were consistent with the findings based on high\u2010quality human connectome project (HCP) data and other brain atlas (C. Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe causes of this phenomenon may be various. First, sFC\u2010ICC was derived directly from sFC matrix while dFC\u2010ICC was derived from the dFC statistic, which was an indirect evaluation of dFC variations (C. Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ). The statistic may not fully represent or describe the dynamic information included in FC variations. Second, dFC analysis is more challenged than sFC analysis. The introduction of temporal dimension largely increased the difficulty and complexity of dFC analysis. Though sliding window estimation method was commonly used, the exploration of accurate dFC evaluation is still ongoing due to the limitations in current approaches (Hutchison et al.,\u00a0 ). From this view, the accuracy of dFC evaluation method may influence the dFC\u2010ICC result. Third, high sFC\u2010ICC means high overall consistence between two scans, while dFC\u2010ICC focuses on the consistence of temporal segments during the scan; the latter may be more dynamic, complex and uncertain due to the dynamic characteristic of our brain functional activity, no matter at rest or under naturalistic stimuli. This uncertainty may reduce the test\u2013retest reliability when considering the temporal consistency of FC segments between two scans. \n\n\n### Associations between   sFC  ,   dFC,   and their   ICCs  \n  \nAs shown in Figure\u00a0 , the associations between sFC, dFC, sFC\u2010ICC, and dFC\u2010ICC were similar for resting\u2010state and natural viewing conditions (C. Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ). First, strong negative correlation was reported between sFC and dFC statistic, in consistent with Zhang et al.'s finding based on high\u2010quality and large\u2010number resting\u2010state HCP data. Given that sFC characterizes an overall FC level of the whole scan, this negative correlation suggests that when the average FC strength is high, the dFC fluctuation is reduced and vice versa. As to the other three correlations, the strengths were obviously lower than Zhang et al.'s results. The negative correlations between dFC and dFC\u2010ICC suggest that when dFC fluctuates more, the dFC\u2010ICC will be weakened. Then, for a specific fMRI scan, high temporal FC variations will lead to a low average sFC and degrade the dFC\u2010ICC performance. The weak positive correlation between sFC\u2010ICC and dFC\u2010ICC suggests that dFC\u2010ICC is consistent with sFC\u2010ICC to some degree when evaluating the test\u2013retest performance of fMRI paradigms. With respect to the relationship between sFC and sFC\u2010ICC, different from Zhang et al.'s finding, the correlation was much lower for resting state while no correlation was found for natural viewing paradigm. The above results may suggest that the imaging quality and number of samples may influence the ICC evaluation. A larger number of populations and improved imaging quality may be adopted for further validation in future. \n\n\n### Impact of brain atlas \n  \nTo further examine the impact of brain atlas on our findings, the Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) atlas was applied to evaluate whole\u2010brain dFC and dFC\u2010ICC. Using 30\u2010TR\u2010length time window, the global\u2010level dFC\u2010ICC was .255 for natural viewing and .183 for resting state, similar to the results of using Craddock atlas. The relationships between sFC, sFC\u2010ICC, dFC and dFC\u2010ICC were also similar: significant strong negative correlation between sFC and dFC (resting state:   r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.897,   p   <.001, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[\u22120.902, \u22120.892]; natural viewing:   r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.894,   p   <.001, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[\u22120.899, \u22120.889]), weak negative correlation between dFC and dFC\u2010ICC (resting state:   r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.264,   p   <.001, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[\u22120.285, \u22120.242]; natural viewing:   r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.296,   p   <.001, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[\u22120.318, \u22120.274]) as well as positive correlation between sFC\u2010ICC and dFC\u2010ICC (resting state:   r  \u00a0=\u00a0.336,   p   <.001, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[0.315, 0.357]; natural viewing:   r  \u00a0=\u00a0.311,   p   <.001, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[0.289, 0.333]). The positive correlation between sFC and sFC\u2010ICC was also very weak (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0.177,   p   <.001, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[0.154, 0.200]) for resting state and natural viewing condition (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0.035,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.004, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[0.011, 0.059]). \n\n\n### Effect of scan order \n  \nThe effect of scan order on test\u2013retest reliability has been discussed in previous studies. For example, Kristo et al. reported higher test\u2013retest reliability of task\u2010fMRI compared to resting\u2010state fMRI in motor network detection. They performed the motor\u2010task before resting\u2010state scan, but found no scan order effects on the reliability (Kristo et al.,\u00a0 ). Yang et al. observed significant higher test\u2013retest reliability of task\u2010based cerebral blood follow (CBF) during psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) than resting\u2010state CBF in both pre\u2010 and post\u2010task resting\u2010state scans (Yang et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nIn the current study, the resting\u2010state scan was performed prior to the natural viewing scan as it has been reported in previous studies that prior cognitive states may influence resting\u2010state functional connectivities (Cecchetto, Fischmeister, Reichert, Bagga, & Schopf,\u00a0 ; Tambini, Ketz, & Davachi,\u00a0 ; Waites, Stanislavsky, Abbott, & Jackson,\u00a0 ). We then further inspected the effect of scan order on the test\u2013retest reliability of dFC. Specifically, both the resting\u2010state and natural viewing sessions were divided into two equal and unoverlapped subsessions (the 1st\u2013108th volumes and 109th\u2013215th volumes, respectively). Then the excursion\u2010based global\u2010level dFC\u2010ICC results were compared between subsession\u2010pair using different parameter combinations of   \u03b1   and   \u03b2   ( ). The second subsession was with strongly increased dFC\u2010ICC compared to the first subsession in both resting\u2010state and natural viewing conditions ( ), indicating that scan order could be a confounding factor in the evaluation of test\u2013retest reliability of dFC. However, the dFC\u2010ICC increasement in the second subsession was much higher in natural viewing condition ( ) compared to that in the resting\u2010state condition ( ), suggesting that the viewers' better engagement in the storyline of the movie stimuli may help to improve the test\u2013retest reliability of dFC. Furthermore, relatively strong increasement of dFC\u2010ICC was observed in the second subsession of natural viewing condition compared to that in the resting\u2010state condition ( ), though the dFC\u2010ICC difference between the first subsessions of the two conditions was not significant ( ). Taken together, these results suggested that natural viewing condition improved dFC\u2010ICC compared to resting state though the effect of scan order may exist. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nUtilizing two scan sessions of resting\u2010state and natural viewing fMRI data from the same group of subjects, the test\u2013retest reliability of dFC statistics were investigated and compared between the above two conditions. For both conditions, the global dFC\u2010ICC was much lower than the sFC\u2010ICC. Specially, significantly elevated global dFC\u2010ICC and local dFC\u2010ICC in visual, limbic and default mode networks were found in natural viewing paradigm compared with resting state. The association between sFC and dFC demonstrated that the more fluctuations of dFC, the lower sFC will be achieved; weak positive correlation between dFC\u2010ICC and sFC\u2010ICC as well as weak negative correlation between dFC and dFC\u2010ICC were also found. The current study demonstrates that naturalistic fMRI paradigm can improve the test\u2013retest reliability of dFC, providing novel evidence for its promotion in functional brain network studies. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors declare no potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8837589, "text_md5": "450c0a50d086dc68c707af662e304981", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 102], "journal": [103, 117], "publication_year": [119, 123], "title": [134, 255], "keywords": [269, 406], "abstract": [419, 2443], "body": [2452, 44716]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 34870361, "doi": "10.1002/hbm.25736", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8837589", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8837589"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8837589\">8837589</a>", "list_title": "PMC8837589  Test\u2013retest reliability of dynamic functional connectivity in naturalistic paradigm functional magnetic resonance imaging"}
