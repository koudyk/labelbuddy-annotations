Furthermore, we took our primary results as a seeding point and fed them into a functional connectivity analysis based on resting-state oscillations in 100 healthy subjects. This subsequent calculation confirmed direct connections of the area OP 2 with every other region found in the meta-analysis, in particular temporo-parietal regions, premotor cortex, and the midcingulate gyrus. Thus revealing a joint vestibular network in accordance with a concept from animal literature termed the inner vestibular circle. Moreover, there was also a significant vestibular connectivity overlap with frontal but not parietal cortical centres responsible for the generation of saccadic eye movements, likely to be involved in nystagmus fast phase generation. This was shown in an additional ocular motor meta-analysis. We conclude that the cytoarchitectonic area OP 2 in the parietal operculum, embedded in a joint vestibular network, should be the primary candidate for the human vestibular cortex. This area may represent the human homologue to the vestibular area PIVC as proposed by Guldin and Gr\u00fcsser in non-human primates.
