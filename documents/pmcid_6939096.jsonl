Prior studies have lacked consistency in identifying common regions of altered neural activity during cognitive tasks. This may be partly due to differences in task paradigm, patient heterogeneity, and methods of fMRI analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis using an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method to identify regions of differential brain activation in patients with mTBI compared to healthy controls. We included experiments that performed scans from acute to subacute time points post-injury. The seven included studies recruited a total sample of 174 patients with mTBIs and 139 control participants. The results of our coordinate based meta-analysis revealed a single cluster of reduced activation within the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) that differentiated mTBI from healthy controls. We conclude that the cognitive impairments in memory and attention typically reported in mTBI patients may be associated with a deficit in the right MFG, which impacts the recruitment of neural networks important for attentional control. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOver the last two decades, task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been employed to investigate functional neuroanatomical networks that relate to cognition following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI;  ). Measurement of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal changes in mTBI during cognitive performance can reveal greater increases (i.e. hyperactivation) and decreases (i.e. hypoactivation) in neural activation across a range of brain regions when compared to a healthy control group. A reduction in neural activity compared to controls has been suggested as a disruption of functional efficiency leading to poorer task performance ( ;  ), whereas increased activation has been theorized as compensatory or due to the recruitment of additional resources to facilitate behavioral responses to cognitive demands ( ;  ). \n\nThe earliest example of fMRI research into mTBI reported greater activation in the frontal-temporal and lateral parietal regions, despite similar behavioral performance to controls, during a task of working memory ( ). More recent studies investigating the differences in brain activity between healthy controls and patients with mTBI have identified changes in several areas of the brain that serve higher-order cognitive processes, including the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC and VLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and posterior areas such as the thalamus and cerebellum ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Conversely, other studies have shown decreased activation (i.e. hypoactivation) when tasks examining executive functions were less challenging ( ) and in pediatric samples ( ;  ). Furthermore, some studies have observed no BOLD differences between groups ( ;  ;  ), highlighting issues of inter-subject variability, timing in post-injury assessment, and differences in the method of fMRI analysis ( ). Thus, the use of a quantitative meta-analysis to address experiment-specific variation and identify common mTBI-related neural activation differences across cognitive tasks is warranted. \n\nThe Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis method ( ) is a quantitative voxel-wise meta-analysis technique that compares the results of neuroimaging studies using reported coordinates in a standardized 3D atlas space in order to identify consistently activated neuroanatomical regions. In a meta-analysis using this methodology,   identified several regions of greater and lesser activation in mTBI compared with healthy controls. The pattern of brain activation suggested reduced activity in anterior regions (e.g. bilateral DLPFC and ACC) and increased activity in posterior regions (e.g. cerebellum, insula, and SMG). Additional findings from  , which included an ALE meta-analysis on working memory experiments, suggest that the type of task and its relative cognitive difficulty may also partially explain the differential activation patterns displayed in mTBI patients. \n\nHowever, a recent report of error in multiple-comparison corrections in older versions of the meta-analytic software used by the prior meta-analyses has emerged ( ). Correcting for multiple comparisons by controlling the (voxel-level) false discovery rate (FDR) leads to inflated positive findings ( ;  ). Another limitation from prior meta-analyses is the inclusion of data that is derived from explicit region-of-interest (ROI) analyses. This can lead to inflated significance for the respective regions when included with experiments deriving coordinates from a whole-brain analysis ( ). Furthermore, due to a small number of studies, prior meta-analyses did not have enough power to explore the effects of experimental variables (e.g. timing post-injury) and were prone to yield clusters of convergence that are almost exclusively driven by single experiments ( ;  ). Together, these factors may have resulted in a high number of spurious findings in prior meta-analyses. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to perform a fMRI meta-analysis of cognitive-related activation differences between healthy controls and patients with mTBI using the most recent ALE approach and focusing on studies that met more specific methodological inclusion criteria. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data sources and search strategy \n  \nA comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify task-based fMRI studies that compared neural responses between patients with mTBI and a healthy control group (see   for an outline of this process). The following electronic databases were searched: Ovid (MEDLINE\u00ae Daily\u00a0+\u00a0Epub Ahead of Print\u00a0+\u00a0In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE Classic\u00a0+\u00a0EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED), EBSCOhost (CINAHL Complete), Wiley Online Library (Cochrane Library), Scopus, and Informit (Health Collection). The searches were confined to full-text research manuscripts published in English and indexed from January 1990 to October 16, 2019.   \nPreferred reporting items of systematic reviews and meta-analyses flow diagram. BOLD, blood oxygenation level dependent; mTBI, mild traumatic brain injury; ROI, region of interest; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging. \n  Fig. 1   \n\nDetailed electronic search strategies and syntax were developed in collaboration with a librarian experienced in systematic reviews (see  ). The key search terms included: Glasgow coma outcome; Glasgow coma scale*; score*; unconscious*; Pneumocephalus; rancho los amigos scale; injur*; trauma*; damag*; wound*; fractur*; contusion*; haematoma*; hematoma*; haemorrhag*; hemorrhag*; pressur*; lesion*; destruction*; oedema*; edema*; contusion*; concus*; swell*; bleed*; mild*; minor; mtbi; concuss*; postconcuss*; post-concuss*; posttraum*; post-traum*; symptom*; syndrome*; complaint*; mri; neuroimag*; fmri; function*; magnetic; brain; neuro; imag*; resonance; Blood Volume; Hemoglobins; Oxygen; blood oxygen level dependent; BOLD; oxyhemoglobin; deoxyhemoglobin; memor*; cognit*; executive function*; executive; dysfunction*; Motor Skills; functionality; attention; memory; disorder*; dysfunction; impaired; impairment; difficult*; problem*; disability; organiz*; organis*; plan*; manag*; problem solving; decision making; and disorder. Additional articles were collected by hand-searching reference lists of relevant articles. \n\n\n### Screening and eligibility \n  \nThe assessing author independently evaluated titles and abstracts of identified studies using the web-based reference management program Mendeley (Mendeley Ltd., London, UK). Studies were included if they met the eligibility criteria listed below.   \nReported original data from a task-based fMRI (review papers excluded). \n  \nIncluded an adult sample (> 18 years) of patients diagnosed with a mTBI using criteria similar to or consistent with the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre Task Force definition ( ). \n  \nIncluded a whole brain voxel-based BOLD analysis incorporating a cognitive challenge compared with a control (less challenge or baseline) condition (excluding ROI analyses). \n  \nActivation coordinates reported in standardized stereotaxic space [either MNI ( ) or Talairach ( ) space]. \n  \nIncluded a healthy control group and presented the results of a 2 -level (group-level) mTBI vs control contrast analysis. \n  \n\nWe only included experiments that performed scans from acute to subacute (i.e. acute 0\u20137 days, subacute 8\u201389 days) time points post-injury ( ). There are many potential confounding factors that would need to be considered if we examined studies including people who sustained their injuries many months or years prior to imaging. If a study did not report the results of a mTBI group separately from moderate/severe TBI participants (e.g.  ), they were excluded. Results from pharmacological or psychological intervention experiments were only included if they reported either baseline between-group differences or treatment main effects involving a placebo/control condition (e.g.  ). If a study conducted an ANOVA analysis, the information equivalent to the mTBI vs. control contrast from the reported group main effects and interactions was selected (e.g.  ). Both greater and lesser (compared to controls) reported activations were included. As the ALE method attempts to identify areas of convergence across significant results, articles that did not report significant findings were unable to be included as there were no coordinates to add to the dataset ( ). For articles that reported results from multiple tasks using the same group (e.g.  ) or used a longitudinal design (e.g.  ), the first contrast of interest was selected to minimize the contribution of any one set of participants to the results from the meta-analysis. We contacted authors of studies who did not report activation coordinates in their paper or presented their results as figures for the additional information (e.g.  ). After initial screening, seven publications fulfilled the aforementioned eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis (see   and   for details of the studies and included contrasts).   \nDescription of sample characteristics from the fMRI publications included in the meta-analysis. \n  Table 1       \nExperiment and contrast specific details of the fMRI publications included in the meta-analysis. \n  Table 2     \n\n\n### Data Extraction and analysis \n  \nThe following data was extracted from each study: first author; year of publication; demographics of mTBI and control subjects (age, number, sex); time to scan following mTBI (the mean/range time between injury and fMRI), injury specific information (mechanism, diagnostic criteria, number of symptomatic/asymptomatic patients and type of measure used, history of previous TBI, and structural imaging findings); task specific (paradigm type, cognitive domain, and if there was a significant difference in behavioral performance between groups); and ALE analysis specific information (source of stereotaxic coordinates, type and number of contrasts included, magnetic field strength (tesla) for fMRI, and whether statistical significance threshold was corrected for multiple comparisons). Independent t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for all 2-group comparisons (the latter was used when the assumptions of normality and variance heterogeneity were violated). \n\n\n### ALE analyses \n  \nWe carried out the ALE meta-analyses using GingerALE v.2.3.6 (brainmap.org/ale). ALE assesses the spatial convergence between reported neuroimaging studies by modelling the reported foci in each study as probability distributions centered on their respective coordinates ( ;  ). This version has fixed errors in both FDR and Family Wise Error (FWE) cluster-level thresholding calculation codes identified in previous iterations ( ). In brief, a bug in the code that incorrectly sorted   P   values before FDR correction found in versions prior to v.2.3.3 allowed for lenient inferences above the cut-off criterion. Additionally, the procedure for establishing the null-distribution of cluster-sizes for cluster-level FWE thresholding contained an error of including all sizes rather than recording the maximum. Prior to a fix in v2.3.2, this resulted in inference based on uncorrected cluster-level   P   values. We used the non-additive algorithm ( ) to minimize within-experiment effects. Prior to the analyses, coordinates reported in Talairach space were converted to MNI using GingerALE's Talairach to MNI conversion tool. The resulting ALE maps were determined at a recommended cluster-level FWE rate-corrected threshold of   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05, and a cluster-forming threshold at voxel-level   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.001 with 1000 permutations ( ). \n\nThree separate analyses were conducted: (1) The first analysis (7 experiments, 64 foci, 313 subjects) pooled all comparisons between mTBI patients and healthy controls; (2) the second analysis (4 experiments, 41 foci, 153 subjects) only included contrasts that reported greater brain activity (mTBI\u00a0>\u00a0control) in mTBI relative to the healthy control group; and (3) the third analysis (4 experiments, 23 foci, 222 subjects) tested for areas of decreased activation in the mTBI group (mTBI\u00a0<\u00a0controls). For illustration, the ALE maps were displayed using MRIcron ( ) with anatomical labelling guided by a Colin27_T1_seg_MNI_2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 template using the Mango visualization program (version 4.0.1.  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Description of included studies and participants \n  \nThe seven included studies recruited a total sample of 174 patients with mTBIs and 139 control participants. The average age of the mTBI group was 29.1 years (  Mdn  \u00a0=\u00a028.1;   SD  \u00a0=\u00a06.2; IQR\u00a0=\u00a025\u201335; range\u00a0=\u00a020\u201338) and more than half were male (57.7%; 95% CI: 44\u201371%). The control group's average age was 29.0 years (  Mdn  \u00a0=\u00a029.9;   SD  \u00a0=\u00a05.3; IQR\u00a0=\u00a025\u201333; range\u00a0=\u00a020\u201334) and more than half were male (59.7%; 95% CI: 47\u201372%). Independent t-tests revealed no significant differences in sample size (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.440), age (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.977), or sex (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.796) between groups. \n\nFunctional imaging was performed at an average of 31.1 days (range = 0\u201369 days) after head injury. The mechanisms of trauma in the mTBI patients included motor vehicle collisions (  n  \u00a0=\u00a033), falls (  n  \u00a0=\u00a037), assault (  n  \u00a0=\u00a04), sport-related concussion (  n  \u00a0=\u00a038), and other mechanisms not defined (  n  \u00a0=\u00a05). Of the five studies that incorporated Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), and loss of consciousness (LOC) into their diagnosis, three reported GCS scores (  M   = 14.5;   SD  \u00a0=\u00a00.5) and 26 individuals with mTBI were identified as having some duration of LOC. Two experiments used sport-related concussion diagnostic guidelines ( ;  ). Four studies included measures of somatic, emotional, and cognitive symptoms that were all greater in the mTBI group ( ;  ;  ;  ). Seven individuals with a previous history of mTBI were reported in one study ( ). Two studies included subjects with abnormal structural imaging ( ;  ), consisting of an intraparenchymal hemorrhage (  n  \u00a0=\u00a01) and microbleeds (  n  \u00a0=\u00a020). \n\nFour studies used the   n  -back working memory paradigm, two employed attention-based tasks with auditory stimuli, and one study utilized a battery of oculomotor tasks. Block design was used in five of the studies and a 3\u00a0T magnet was used most commonly to acquire imaging data. For six out of seven studies, similar performance was reported on the cognitive tasks between the mTBI group and the control group. Only one study reported a difference in behavioral performance between groups ( ). The method of fMRI analysis was variable across the range of studies and included uncorrected (  n  \u00a0=\u00a02) and corrected (  n  \u00a0=\u00a05) thresholding. \n\nIncreased activation in the mTBI group in one or more brain areas was reported in four of seven studies, and the number of foci with increased activation was 11, 9, 20, and 1 across those studies. Decreased activation in the mTBI group in one or more brain areas was reported in four of seven studies, and the number of foci with decreased activation was 1, 6, 7, and 9 across those studies. One study reported 20 areas of increased activation and 9 areas of decreased activation ( ). \n\n\n### ALE findings \n  \nIn the pooled whole-brain meta-analysis of the seven studies that reported 64 foci of activation, a single activation cluster that differentiated between patients with mTBI and healthy controls was found in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG, BA 9; see   and  ). For the meta-analysis of the four studies reporting 41 foci of increased activation, there were no significant clusters of increased activation in patients with mTBI compared to healthy controls. For the meta-analysis of the four studies reporting 23 foci of decreased activation, the mTBI group showed reduced activation compared with controls within the right MFG (see   and  ).   \nMeta-analytical map of pooled activation in mTBI group.

Seven studies were included in this meta-analysis, and those studies reported inconsistent findings. Across the seven studies, 64 foci of activation, 41 areas of hyperactivation and 23 areas of hypoactivation, were identified. The result of our pooled meta-analysis revealed a single significant activation cluster in the right MFG in those with mTBI compared to controls. Secondary analyses examining the directionality of group contrasts (i.e., mTBI\u00a0>\u00a0controls; mTBI\u00a0<\u00a0controls), revealed less activation in the same cluster in the right MFG in mTBI versus controls. No significant clusters were observed when including contrasts only from experiments reporting greater activations in mTBI. \n\nThe total number of included experiments (  n  \u00a0=\u00a07) was slightly lower compared to previous meta-analyses. Five of the primary studies from   were excluded for being limited to ROI results only ( ;  ;  ), including an adolescent sample ( ), or being a resting-state fMRI study ( ). Similarly, seven studies from   were excluded for reporting on ROI results only ( ,  ;  ;  ,  ;  ), or including an adolescent sample ( ). \n\nThe significant cluster activated in the right MFG during cognitive-based tasks was consistent with the results of previous meta-analyses. However, our study did not support the previous findings of significant clusters in other regions of the frontal-parietal cortex (e.g., anterior cingulate) and in more posterior areas (e.g., cerebellar tonsil). These observations could be accounted for by the differences in the studies included and/or the use of more lenient statistical thresholds used in previous meta-analyses. In the current meta-analysis, the right MFG was reported as a region of activation in five out of seven of the included studies. Examining the results from these studies, three reported a statistically significant reduction in activation in the right MFG ( ;  ;  ), and two reported statistically significant increases in activation in the right MFG ( ;  ). Potential sources of this variation may be explained by differences in experimental design, analytical methodology, and participant characteristics ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nWithin the prefrontal cortex, the MFG is connected to a network of regions that are commonly co-activated during tasks requiring executive functions ( ;  ;  ). Specifically, the right MFG has been proposed to be a convergence site between the ventral attention network (VAN) and the dorsal attention network (DAN), which work in conjunction to switch between goal-directed and stimulus-driven attention by filtering out distractions and orienting attention to task-relevant information ( ;  ). This region has been suggested to be \u201ccircuit-breaker\u201d that interrupts DAN functioning to reorient attention towards novel task-relevant stimuli ( ;  ). In the context of mTBI, previous functional neuroimaging studies have reported differential activation in the right MFG area across a variety of cognitive paradigms with the majority of tasks involving working memory ( ;  ; van der Horn et\u00a0al., 2016;  ). Taken together, altered recruitment of the right MFG after mTBI may represent an over-arching disruption in modulating attention. These findings are also consistent with resting-state fMRI studies in concussion and mTBI, which have observed altered functional connectivity in the right MFG ( ) as well as other regions that mediate internally-oriented processes ( ;  ;  ). \n\nAs evidenced in our included experiments (see  ), the   n  -back paradigm is the most frequently used working memory task in the current mTBI literature. It is used to assess an individual's ability to hold information in mind for further processing while subject to increasing cognitive demand ( ). Working memory is an area of cognition that has been found to be adversely affected by mTBI ( ;  ;  ). Further, problems with working memory also emerge during the early recovery phase rather than forming part of the initial symptomology ( ). Our finding of disturbed right MFG activation in mTBI patients may therefore reflect atypical neurophysiological changes associated with cognitive impairments in memory and attention. This view is supported by functional differentiation evidence that show the right MFG as an area of focus in task demand/novelty processing ( ;  ). \n\nA novel finding in the present work is that contrast-specific involvement of the right MFG was apparent for our analysis that incorporated hypoactivation findings and not for those that reported hyperactivation. Various authors have attempted to conceptualize the directionality of recruitment in the prefrontal region following brain injury in relation to task performance. It has been proposed that greater activation in response to a cognitively demanding task may represent a transient compensatory effect ( ;  ), permanent rewiring ( ;  ), or the result of a native support mechanism to assist in task performance ( ;  ). Conversely, underactivity (i.e. hypoactivation) may reflect a disruption in this network caused by pathophysiological changes which limit the capacity for focused attention and external goal directed processes ( ;  ;  ;  ). Of note, cognitive task performance was mostly equivalent between our meta-analysis group of mTBI and healthy controls (see  ). In six out of seven studies, the mTBI group performed similarly to the control group on the cognitive task. One methodological constraint with imaging research is requiring near perfect accuracy on tasks to facilitate data interpretation ( ). Furthermore, recruitment demand for prefrontal regions following brain injury has been shown to diminish at similar rates in both injured and healthy controls with increased task practice and familiarity ( ). Thus, while our findings are in support of functional change in the neuroanatomical region of the MFG, the direction of change (i.e. greater or lesser activation) and the underlying cause are unclear. \n\nFrom   and  , the description of participant characteristics highlights the scope and context of inter-subject variation in mTBI. Within our mTBI group, the number of sport-related concussions, motor vehicle accidents, and falls as injury mechanisms was relatively similar. However, biomechanical loading data reveal that primary injury strain and impact forces vary considerably depending on injury mechanism and are not uniformly distributed across grey and white matter regions of the brain ( ;  ). Previous reviews into the adaptive and pathophysiological changes following mTBI ( ;  ) also highlight the issue of a complex and time-varied injury profile. Although we limited the scope of functional assessment post-injury to the acute-subacute phase, there is no clear consensus on how these processes affect recovery as measured by fMRI after mTBI ( ). This is evidenced in longitudinal fMRI studies which showcase varied patterns of within-subject BOLD signal changes ( ;  ;  ). Finally, it is important to note the subset of subjects with complications identified on structural scans. Whereas some definitions of mTBI include patients with intracranial imaging abnormalities ( ), it is increasingly more common in current studies to reclassify mTBI into uncomplicated and complicated dichotomies based on CT/MRI findings ( ). However, symptom outcomes associated with structural findings remains inconsistent ( ;  ). Even though our activation clusters were not driven by singular studies (see  ), it is important to consider these inter-subject variability factors regarding the outcome of inferential analysis ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nA vital consideration for the current meta-analysis and for fMRI methodology in general, is that the vasculature that underlies the BOLD signal can be impaired following brain trauma. Alterations in cerebral blood flow, perfusion, and vascular reactivity have all been found following mTBI ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Alteration in the cerebrovascular dynamics can lead to subsequent change in the ratio of intravascular oxy- to deoxyhemoglobin, which contribute to the BOLD signal ( ;  ). For example, a recent series of fMRI studies found that the shape and magnitude of the signal can differentiate between a sample of mTBI patients and controls ( ,  ). While the authors found signal disturbance within several areas in the mTBI group, most cortical and subcortical regions involved during the visual tracking tasks were normal. Therefore, it remains to be known whether these secondary pathophysiological changes affect the BOLD signal across the entire brain or only the most vulnerable areas ( ). Ideally, future studies should measure baseline cerebrovascular parameters (e.g. cerebral blood flow) to partial out any potential effect of neurovascular uncoupling due to alterations in vascular physiology. \n\nCompared to previous coordinate-based meta-analyses, we used the latest version of ALE software and included several additional studies not previously incorporated ( ;  ; van der Horn et\u00a0al., 2016;  ). Additionally, we did not include any study that used an explicit ROI analysis ( ;  ,  ;  ) or adolescent population ( ;  ). While our study represents the most up-to-date literature search of fMRI findings in mTBI, our conservative inclusion criteria limited the total number of experiments available. Owing to the low numbers of experiments, our ALE meta-analysis may not have had enough power to completely partial out subject-specific variation ( ). Separate exploratory meta-analyses investigating the effect of task domain and type, behavioral performance, time after injury, age, and corrected threshold contrast could not be performed due to strict inclusion criteria and the number of experiments available ( ). Future studies addressing these variations will lead to improved research outcomes and a better understanding of the impaired functional networks that may underlie cognitive dysfunction in mTBI. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, the present meta-analysis employed a coordinate-based ALE approach to identify affected brain areas relating to cognitive dysfunction following mTBI. We used GingerALE v.2.3.6 (brainmap.org/ale), a version of ALE that has fixed errors in both FDR and FWE cluster-level thresholding calculation codes identified in previous versions of the program. Our results revealed neural activation differences across a variety of cognitive tasks, with the mTBI group displaying hypoactivation within the right MFG. Consistent with prior meta-analyses ( ;  ) this finding suggests that the prefrontal region may be particularly affected following mTBI. However, although these results are in support of functional change in the neuroanatomical region of the MFG, the direction of change (i.e. greater or lesser activation) and the underlying causes remain unclear and require future study. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. \n\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest \n  \nMichael J.
