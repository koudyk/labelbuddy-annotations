Neuroimaging helps physicians diagnose mental illnesses and find novel treatments for them. It can distinguish depression from neurodegenerative diseases or brain tumors, and it can reveal structural defects that cause psychosis. Psychosis has been linked to lesions in the frontal or temporal lobes of the brain, as well as the thalamus and hypothalamus, which can be detected using a brain scan for mental illnesses. Neuroimaging uses quantitative and computational methods to explore the central nervous system. It can detect brain injuries and psychological illnesses. Thus, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using neuroimaging to detect psychiatric disorders assessed their efficacy and benefits. Appropriate articles were searched from PubMed, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL databases using the appropriate keywords as per the PRISMA guidelines. Randomized controlled trials and open-label studies were included as per the predefined PICOS criteria. Meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan software, and statistical parameters like odds ratio and risk difference were calculated. Twelve randomized controlled clinical trials with a total of 655 psychiatric patients were included following the criteria from the year 2000 to 2022. We included studies that use different neuroimaging techniques for the detection of organic brain lesions that would help diagnose psychiatric disorders. The primary outcome was detecting brain abnormalities in diverse psychiatric illnesses with neuroimaging versus conventional methods. We found the odds ratio value of 2.29 (95% CI 1.49-3.51). The results were heterogeneous with a Tau2 value of 0.38, chi2 value of 35.48, df value of 11, I2 value of 69%, the z value of 3.78, and p-value less than 0.05. The risk difference is 0.20 (95% CI 0.09 -0.31) with heterogeneity of Tau2 value of 0.03, chi2 value of 50, df value of 11, I2 value of 78%, the z value of 3.49, and p-value less than 0.05. The present meta-analysis strongly recommends the use of neuroimaging techniques for the detection of psychiatric disorders.
