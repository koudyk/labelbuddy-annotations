However, there is limited information on brain\u2013behavior relationships of persistent motor impairment following clinical recovery from concussion. We examined the relationship between subtle motor performance and functional connectivity of the brain in adolescents with a history of concussion, status post\u2010symptom resolution, and subjective return to baseline. Participants included 27 adolescents who were clinically recovered from concussion and 29 never\u2010concussed, typically developing controls (10\u201317\u2009years); all participants were examined using the Physical and Neurologic Examination of Subtle Signs (PANESS). Functional connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) or dorsal attention network (DAN) and regions of interest within the motor network was assessed using resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Compared to controls, adolescents clinically recovered from concussion showed greater subtle motor deficits as evaluated by the PANESS and increased connectivity between the DMN and left lateral premotor cortex. DMN to left lateral premotor cortex connectivity was significantly correlated with the total PANESS score, with more atypical connectivity associated with more motor abnormalities. This suggests that altered functional connectivity of the brain may underlie subtle motor deficits in adolescents who have clinically recovered from concussion. More investigation is required to understand the persistence and longer\u2010term clinical relevance of altered functional connectivity and associated subtle motor deficits to inform whether functional connectivity may serve as an important biomarker related to longer\u2010term outcomes after clinical recovery from concussion. \n  \nThis study examined functional connectivity and subtle motor deficits in adolescents clinically recovered from a concussion. Compared to never\u2010injured controls, adolescents clinically recovered from concussion showed greater subtle motor deficits and increased connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and left lateral premotor cortex. DMN to left lateral premotor cortex connectivity significantly correlated with the total PANESS score, with more atypical connectivity associated with more motor abnormalities.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nConcussions (mild traumatic brain injury [mTBI]) are a serious public health concern, and adolescents may be uniquely susceptible to negative long\u2010term consequences (Schmidt et al.,\u00a0 ). The adolescent brain shows continued maturation during this age range and may be more vulnerable to longer recovery from a brain injury (Field et al.,\u00a0 ). There is growing consensus that neurobiological recovery following a pediatric concussion may be incomplete at medical clearance to return to play (Churchill et al.,\u00a0 ,  ). Common assessments of pediatric concussions, including self\u2010 or parent\u2010reported questionnaires or neuropsychological tests, are highly sensitive in the acute phase but demonstrate reduced sensitivity in the sub\u2010acute phase (>1\u2010week post\u2010injury; McCrea et al.,\u00a0 ). Additionally, most measures do not provide an index of the underlying neuropathology (Schmidt et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nEmerging research suggests that adolescents who have clinically recovered from concussion (and have been cleared to return to play) still show abnormalities in motor performance (Crasta, Raja, et al.,\u00a0 ; Howell et al.,\u00a0 ; Sosnoff et al.,\u00a0 ; Stephens et al.,\u00a0 ). Persistent motor deficits following injury in concussed athletes are also observed during gait and postural control tasks (Murray et al.,\u00a0 ) and on motor performance during dual\u2010task conditions (Howell et al.,\u00a0 ). Moreover, asymptomatic adolescents can display atypical cognitive\u2010motor performance until nearly 2\u2009years post\u2010concussion (Dalecki et al.,\u00a0 ). These findings are particularly noteworthy considering the increased incidence of additional injuries in athletes returning to play (Herman et al.,\u00a0 ; Howell et al.,\u00a0 ) and proposed underlying neuromuscular control deficits associated with lower\u2010extremity musculoskeletal injury following recovery from concussion (Eagle et al.,\u00a0 ; Oldham et al.,\u00a0 ). From a mechanistic perspective, Cantarero et al. ( ) utilized non\u2010invasive brain stimulation to demonstrate corticomotor pathway dysfunction and deficits in motor skill learning, due to impaired retention, that begin within 2\u2009weeks of concussion and persist >1\u2010year post\u2010injury (Cantarero et al.,\u00a0 ). As such, there is a critical need for behavioral measures that are sensitive to motor control and learning deficits in young athletes to identify those at greatest risk. Furthermore, there is a need for ongoing research examining the neurophysiological basis of these motor deficits to support the development and evaluation of rehabilitative interventions. \n\nRecent research has shown that the Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs (PANESS; Denckla,\u00a0 ) can detect persistent motor sequelae beyond the acute phase in pediatric concussion and is more sensitive to subtle motor dysfunction across the severity spectrum of pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared to standard neurocognitive measures (Crasta, Raja, et al.,\u00a0 ; Stephens et al.,\u00a0 ,  ,  ). The PANESS is a brief (~20\u2009min to administer) performance\u2010based measure evaluating subtle motor signs of overflow, dysrhythmia, and speed of movements during gait, balance, and timed activities, capturing bilateral performance and using less familiar tasks (e.g., walking on the sides of the feet, heel tapping; Denckla,\u00a0 ). The PANESS demonstrates strong psychometric properties including construct validity (Crasta et al.,\u00a0 ; Saleem et al.,\u00a0 ), test\u2013retest reliability (Holden et al.,\u00a0 ; Stephens et al.,\u00a0 ; Vitiello et al.,\u00a0 ), and inter\u2010rater reliability (Svingos et al.,\u00a0 ; Vitiello et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe PANESS is sensitive to the effects of age (Crasta, Raja, et al.,\u00a0 ; Crasta, Zhao, et al.,\u00a0 ), and performance on the measure improves with time since injury among children with concussion (Stephens et al.,\u00a0 ) and mild\u2013moderate TBI (Stephens et al.,\u00a0 ). After accounting for confounding effects of age and level of athletic ability, adolescents fully cleared to return to activities after concussion exhibit greater subtle motor deficits on the PANESS compared to never\u2010injured controls (Crasta, Raja, et al.,\u00a0 ). The enhanced sensitivity of the PANESS for deficits related to subtle motor function and motor learning, compared to simple motor function tasks often used during clinical care, suggests that the PANESS may be a good candidate as a marker of neurophysiological changes after concussion (Crasta, Raja, et al.,\u00a0 ; Stephens et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nDeficits on the PANESS have also been linked to alterations in brain structure and function in children with more severe forms of TBI. In children more than 1\u2009year after moderate\u2013severe TBI, greater motor deficits were associated with a smaller volume of motor/premotor cortex (Crasta et al.,\u00a0 ). Risen et al. ( ) investigated functional connectivity of the (a) default mode network (DMN) and (b) dorsal attention network (DAN) with the rest of the brain in adolescents with mild\u2010complicated and moderate TBI 2\u2009months post\u2010injury and showed that between\u2010group differences from control participants were limited to connectivity with motor regions (Risen et al.,\u00a0 ). In these children with TBI, increased (more atypical) connectivity between the DMN and motor regions was associated with poorer motor performance on the PANESS. The authors posited that increased connectivity between the DMN (a task\u2010negative network typically deactivated during tasks demanding outward attention) and motor regions may impair task\u2010related recruitment of motor regions. In contrast, increased (also more atypical) connectivity between the DAN and motor regions correlated with better motor performance (Risen et al.,\u00a0 ). The authors hypothesized that increased connectivity of motor regions with the DAN, a task\u2010positive network activated during attention\u2010demanding tasks (Raichle,\u00a0 ), may serve as a compensatory mechanism. Further research is required to examine if a similar relationship between motor performance and functional connectivity exists in adolescents with concussion. \n\nTo date, in adolescents post\u2010concussion, studies have shown altered functional connectivity across various regions, not only during the symptomatic phase of concussion but also after the resolution of acute symptoms (Churchill et al.,\u00a0 ; Rausa et al.,\u00a0 ; Schmidt et al.,\u00a0 ). A common finding across studies includes persistent hyper\u2010connectivity between the DMN and other networks such as the DAN, and such alterations have been associated with poor outcomes (Iyer et al.,\u00a0 ; Schmidt et al.,\u00a0 ). Studies have also consistently shown both structural (Borich et al.,\u00a0 ; Virji\u2010Babul et al.,\u00a0 ) and functional (Ashe et al.,\u00a0 ; Borich et al.,\u00a0 ; Schmidt et al.,\u00a0 ) alterations in the attention network and motor regions including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region associated with top\u2010down control of goal\u2010directed motor performance and explicit motor learning. Increased connectivity within motor regions in adolescent mTBI has been shown to persist up to 3\u00a0months post\u2010injury (Manning,\u00a0 ), and alterations in the mPFC have been associated with persistent post\u2010concussion symptoms following pediatric mTBI (Iyer et al.,\u00a0 ). However, there is limited research examining the clinical correlates of persisting altered connectivity post\u2010concussion including in youth who have been medically cleared post\u2010injury. \n\nImaging studies on concussion have often failed to find strong brain\u2013behavior relationships which have been partly attributed to the lack of sensitive clinical assessments (Schmidt et al.,\u00a0 ). Currently, there is no optimal behavioral marker that is sensitive to recovery from a pediatric concussion, associated with functional connectivity, and feasible for widespread clinical use (Schmidt et al.,\u00a0 ). Given this need, the present study aimed to examine whether subtle motor performance, as measured by the PANESS, is associated with altered functional connectivity in adolescents clinically recovered from concussion. Building from prior research, we examined the functional connectivity of (a) DMN and (b) DAN with pre\u2010determined motor regions of interest (ROIs). Applying whole\u2010brain analyses in one data set to both discover group differences in functional connectivity and examine relationships between functional connectivity and behavior can result in circular analyses (Kriegeskorte et al.,\u00a0 ). To avoid this circularity, we selected motor ROIs based on anatomically defined parcellations of the frontal lobe in children (Ranta et al.,\u00a0 ). We hypothesized that adolescents clinically recovered from concussion would show increased functional connectivity compared to controls and that more anomalous functional connectivity would be associated with greater motor deficits on the PANESS. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Procedure \n  \nThe Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Research Board approved this research. Child assent and parent/guardian's written informed consent were obtained before study participation for all participants. Data from participants ages 10\u201317\u2009years with a recent history of concussion (following symptom resolution and subjective return to baseline) and never\u2010concussed, neurotypical controls were made available from across three different research protocols (including a subset of participants whose PANESS data have been previously published; Crasta, Raja, et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nFor inclusion in the current study, participants needed to have behavioral testing and resting state neuroimaging conducted at the same research study visit. For inclusion in the concussion group, participants needed to have a diagnosis of concussion with subsequent clinical recovery, defined as resolution of all concussion symptoms and subjective return to baseline (assessed via parent report). Participants were excluded if they did not have a resting state fMRI scan meeting quality assurance criteria (see Section\u00a0  for details) or if they had developmental/learning/mental health diagnoses (e.g., attention\u2010deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression), or any other medical diagnosis known to be associated with altered brain function or structure (e.g., history of epilepsy; moderate to severe TBI). \n\n\n### Measures \n  \n#### Revised Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs \n  \nPANESS (Denckla,  ) administrations were conducted by a trained psychology associate or masters\u2010level research assistant in a laboratory setting (hallway for gait assessment portion, testing room for other portions). Total PANESS summary scores were used for analysis in the current study which reflects the sum of total scores for the timed motor (total timed summary score) and gaits and stations (total gaits and stations summary score) sections of the PANESS. The gaits and stations section involves items requiring walking on heels, toes, and sides of feet, forward and backward tandem gait, and balance tasks including maintaining tandem stance with eyes closed, standing on both feet with eyes closed, and with arms and fingers outstretched, standing on one foot, and hopping. Scores for this section are derived based on the presence of ambulatory errors, impersistence, foot\u2010to\u2010hand overflow, and involuntary movements (e.g., choreiform). The timed motor section includes repetitive and sequenced movements such as foot\u2010tapping, heel\u2010toe tapping, hand patting, hand pronation/supination, finger tapping, finger apposition (tapping the thumb to each of the four other fingers in a fixed sequence), and tongue\u2010wagging. Scores in this section incorporate speed for completing repetitive and sequenced movements as well as the presence of any overflow or dysrhythmia during associated trials. Total PANESS scores range from 0 to 105, with higher scores reflecting greater subtle motor signs, including the presence of balance disturbances, speed/accuracy deficits, overflow movements, and dysrhythmia. Overflow scores were not age\u2010corrected (Crasta, Zhao, et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n#### Lifetime Sports Participation Questionnaire \n  \nParents of all participants completed a survey describing their child's lifetime history of participation in organized sports or related physical activities, such as dance, and the associated level of competition for each sport/activity. For the current study, data was available as to the highest level of competition reported for each child in one of four categories: none, recreational (no try\u2010outs), school, or travel/select. For analysis, the competition level was grouped into low (non\u2010athletes and those participating in organized sports or related activities only at a recreational level) and high (participation in school and/or travel/select activities; Crasta, Raja, et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n#### Imaging protocol \n  \nAll participants underwent brief training in a mock scanner to habituate to the MRI environment and to practice lying still. Resting state\u2010fMRI was acquired during a 6\u2010min 40\u2010s scan (including the first 10\u00a0s that were discarded for magnetization stabilization) on a 3.0\u2010T Philips \u201cAchieva\u201d MRI scanner (Best, The Netherlands) using a single\u2010shot, partially parallel, gradient\u2010recalled echo\u2010planar sequence with SENSitivity Encoding (SENSE) and a 32\u2010channel receiver head coil (repetition time [TR]\u00a0=\u00a02500\u2009ms, echo time [TE]\u00a0=\u00a030\u2009ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a075\u00b0, SENSE acceleration factor of 3, in\u2010plane resolution\u00a0=\u00a03.0\u2009\u00d7\u20093.0\u2009mm, matrix size\u00a0=\u00a084\u2009\u00d7\u200984, 156 volumes saved). Whole\u2010brain coverage was obtained using 47 contiguous 3\u2009mm axial slices acquired in ascending order, parallel to the anterior and posterior commissure (AC\u2010PC plane). Participants were instructed to relax and focus on a centrally located crosshair mark during scan acquisition. \n\n\n#### Resting state\u2010fMRI processing \n  \nPreprocessing of functional images was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 12, Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, London, United Kingdom) and custom\u2010written MATLAB scripts (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA). Resting state\u2010fMRI scans were slice\u2010time adjusted using the slice acquired at the middle of the TR as a reference. Next, rigid body realignment parameters from alignment with the mean volume were estimated to account for participant head motion. The volume collected in the middle of the scan was spatially normalized using the Montreal Neurological Institute EPI template (Calhoun et al.,\u00a0 ). The estimated rigid body and nonlinear spatial transformations were applied to the functional data in one unified step, resulting in 2\u2009mm isotropic voxels. Linear trends were removed from the data on a voxelwise basis. Nuisance signals were estimated from the ventricles and white matter using the aCompCor method (Muschelli et al.,\u00a0 ), which has been shown to enhance group discriminability (Shirer et al.,\u00a0 ), and then regressed from each voxel along with linearly detrended versions of the six motion parameters and their first derivatives estimated through backward differences. A 6\u2010mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) filter was used to spatially smooth functional images that were then temporally filtered (bandpass 0.01\u20130.1\u00a0Hz). Prior to imaging analysis, all scans were checked for image quality and registration to the EPI template by two trained research assistants. All included data met motion criteria of between\u2010volume translational movements <3\u2009mm and rotational movements <3\u00b0 (Fassbender et al.,\u00a0 ). Mean and max framewise displacement (FD) were calculated using the realignment parameters (Power et al.,\u00a0 ) and group differences in mean and max FD were assessed using independent samples   t  \u2010tests. \n\n\n#### Resting\u2010state fMRI connectivity analysis \n  \nA seed\u2010based correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate DMN\u2013motor and DAN\u2013motor functional connectivity. First, the DMN and the DAN were represented by three predefined 6\u2009mm\u2010radius spherical seeds centered at locations based on existing resting state\u2010fMRI studies (Fox et al.,\u00a0 ; Risen et al.,\u00a0 ). The DMN seeds included the mPFC (Talairach coordinates: \u22121, 47, \u22124), posterior cingulate cortex (\u22125, \u221249, 40), and the lateral parietal cortex (\u221245, \u221267, 36). The DAN seeds included the intra\u2010parietal sulcus (\u221225, \u221257, 46), frontal eye field (25, \u221213, 50), and the middle temporal region (\u221245, \u221269, \u22122). The seed coordinates were converted to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the Lancaster transformation (Lancaster et al.,\u00a0 ). For each participant, an average time course was generated for each seed. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between each seed region's average time course and every other voxel within the brain and then converted to a normal distribution by Fisher's   z  \u2010transformation. The three whole\u2010brain connectivity maps for each network were averaged to generate one DMN and DAN map for each participant. \n\nSecond, given our specific interest in examining DMN and DAN functional connectivity with the motor system, we created a single motor mask by combining eight functionally relevant motor ROIs from the Ranta Atlas aligned to MNI space (primary motor cortex [M1], the sensorimotor motor cortex [SMC], lateral premotor cortex, and mPFC for each hemisphere; Ranta et al.,\u00a0 ). Multivariable regression models including sex and competition level as covariates were constructed to examine group differences in DMN\u2013motor and DAN\u2013motor functional connectivity for every voxel within the motor mask. Sex and competition level were included as covariates given their confounding role on motor skills and lack of 1:1 matching for these variables (Crasta, Raja, et al.,\u00a0 ). The significance of group differences was assessed using a voxel\u2010level threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001, in combination with a cluster\u2010level threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05, and then we identified the Ranta ROI in which any significant clusters were located. \n\nTo explore the clinical relevance of these group\u2010level functional connectivity differences, we also examined brain\u2013behavior associations. To avoid circular analyses and to validate prior brain\u2013behavior relationships (Risen et al.,\u00a0 ), we examined connectivity across the entirety of each of the eight anatomically defined Ranta motor ROIs for this analysis. Using the entirety of each motor ROI allows for the generalizability of brain\u2013behavior relationships beyond isolated findings of significant voxels associated with the group differences as defined in the analysis described above and minimizes the potential for double\u2010dipping (Kriegeskorte et al.,\u00a0 ,  ). For each participant and network, we calculated the average functional connectivity score within each motor ROI separately. As a result, 16 connectivity values (eight DMN\u2010to\u2010motor pairs, and eight DAN\u2010to\u2010motor pairs) were derived for each participant. See Figure\u00a0  for a summary of our processing pipeline. \n  \nProcessing pipeline for resting\u2010state fMRI and seed\u2010based functional connectivity. All subject\u2010level processing steps are outlined from (a) to (d). (a) Resting\u2010state fMRI data were obtained from both the concussion group and control group. All participants' data were preprocessed using the same steps. (b) The DAN included three task\u2010positive seed regions: FEF, IPS, and MT+. The DMN included three task\u2010negative seed regions: LPC, mPFC, and PCC. (c) Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between the mean time course of each seed region and every other brain voxel, and then converted to   z  \u2010scores via Fisher's   z   transformation. (d) Correlation maps from task positive and task negative seed regions were averaged to generate one DAN and one DMN connectivity map for each participant. (e) Group differences in DAN\u2013motor and DMN\u2013motor functional connectivity were assessed for all voxels within a single motor mask while controlling for sex and competition level. Correlation maps and motor ROI masks computed in volume space were inflated to the surface for display purposes only. DAN, dorsal attention network; DMN, default mode network; FEF, frontal eye field; IPS, intra\u2010parietal sulcus; LPC, lateral parietal cortex; M1, primary motor cortex; mPFC, medial prefrontal cortex; MT+, middle temporal region; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex; ROIs, regions of interest; SMC, supplementary motor cortex. \n  \nAnalysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to assess group differences in PANESS scores with and without confounder adjustment. The effects of the covariates on these analyses are provided in Table\u00a0 . Effect sizes are reported using partial eta\u2010squared (  \u03b7  ; small\u00a0=\u00a00.01, medium\u00a0=\u00a00.06, large\u00a0=\u00a00.14; Richardson,\u00a0 ). Brain\u2013behavior relationships across each Ranta motor\u2010relevant ROI were examined using partial correlations between network connectivity and total PANESS score controlling for sex and competition level in the whole sample and within each group. Multiple regressions were run to predict the total PANESS score from group, sex, competition level, and the various DMN and DAN motor connectivity pairs. For brain\u2013behavior relationships, we did not correct for multiple comparisons. Data were inspected for outliers above 3.29 standard deviations, assessed for normality, and tested for the appropriate statistical assumptions per statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 25. Left\u2010 and mixed\u2010handed participants were excluded from primary analyses given our interest in functional connectivity involving motor regions; however, analyses including these participants are provided in   for reference. \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Participant demographics \n  \nA total of 32 concussion participants completed resting\u2010state imaging, but   n  \u00a0=\u00a02 were excluded from analysis due to scans failing to meet motion quality control criteria and   n  \u00a0=\u00a03 were non\u2010righted\u2010handed. In the never\u2010concussed group,   n  \u00a0=\u00a03, were excluded from primary analyses due to non\u2010right\u2010handedness. The final sample included 27 adolescents in the concussion group (13 males;   M  \u00a0=\u00a014.71; SD\u00a0=\u00a02.51) and 29 never\u2010concussed, neurotypical children (11 males;   M  \u00a0=\u00a014.50, SD\u00a0=\u00a02.45\u2009years). Participant characteristics and total PANESS scores are presented in Table\u00a0 . For the concussion group, the mean number of days post\u2010concussion was 80.30,   SD  \u00a0=\u00a041.91, range of 27\u2013183\u2009days. For a subset of the concussion group (  n  \u00a0=\u00a022, 81%), the exact clearance date was documented, and mean days from injury to clearance was 41.36, SD\u00a0=\u00a025.27, range 10\u201397\u2009days. No significant group differences were found for mean FD (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.55) and max FD (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.47). \n  \nParticipant demographics and PANESS scores. \n    \n\n### Group differences in   PANESS  : Subtle motor performance is worse in adolescents clinically recovered from concussion compared to controls \n  \nThe ANCOVA model accounting for sex and competition level showed that the concussion group had worse motor performance on the total PANESS score (  F  \u00a0=\u00a05.85,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.019,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.101) than the control group. See Table\u00a0  for details regarding the impact of covariates on subtle motor function. \n  \nEffect of covariates on subtle motor function. \n    \n\n### Group differences in functional connectivity:   DMN  \u2013premotor functional connectivity is stronger in adolescents clinically recovered from concussion compared to controls \n  \nFigure\u00a0  illustrates t\u2010maps of DMN\u2013motor functional connectivity for the concussion group, the control group, and the concussion\u2010control group difference controlling for sex and competition level. Some evidence of regions within the motor mask showing both stronger and weaker functional connectivity with the DMN in concussion adolescents compared to controls can be seen. However, the only cluster with a significant group difference was found within the left lateral premotor region, in which the concussion group, on average, showed stronger functional connectivity with the DMN compared to the control group (peak MNI coordinate:   x  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221238,   y  \u00a0=\u00a00,   z  \u00a0=\u00a046,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.049) and showed a positive correlation between these regions. In contrast, the control group showed no or slightly negative correlation between these regions. See Table\u00a0  for details regarding the impact of covariates on peak MNI coordinates from regions with significant group differences and directionality. No other significant group differences in DMN\u2013motor functional connectivity were observed. There were also no significant group differences observed in DAN\u2013motor functional connectivity. \n  \nDefault mode network (DMN)\u2013premotor functional connectivity is stronger in adolescents in the concussion group compared to controls.

Similarly, stronger DMN\u2013right primary motor cortex (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.032), and DMN\u2013left/right SMC (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05) functional connectivity were associated with higher total PANESS scores or worse motor control (see Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nStronger default mode network (DMN)\u2013left lateral premotor functional connectivity is associated with poorer motor control. Trend lines are shown across all adolescents and within each group. \n    \nBrain\u2013behavior relationships across levels of covariates. \n    \nCorrelations within each group separately indicated that the relationship between DMN\u2013motor connectivity and total PANESS score was stronger in the concussion group (  r  \u2010values range: 0.156\u20130.475) compared to the control group (  r  \u2010values range: \u22120.211\u20130.316). In the concussion group, there was a statistically significant relationship between DMN\u2013left/right lateral premotor cortex (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05), DMN\u2013left/right primary motor cortex (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05), and DMN\u2013left/right SMC, and total PANESS score. There were no other significant associations between other DMN\u2013motor pairs and total PANESS score. The DMN\u2013motor pairs by group multiple regression models accounting for sex and competition level did not statistically significantly predict total PANESS score (see Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n####  DAN  \u2013  motor   functional connectivity \n  \nFunctional connectivity between the DAN and all motor regions was significantly associated with total PANESS. Namely, stronger DAN\u2013left/right lateral premotor cortex (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05), stronger DAN\u2013left/right mPFC (  p  \u2009<\u2009.005), stronger DAN\u2013left/right primary motor cortex (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05), and stronger DAN\u2013left/right SMC (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05), were all associated with higher total PANESS, or more motor deficits (see Table\u00a0 ). \n\nCorrelations within each group separately indicated that the relationship between DAN\u2013motor connectivity and total PANESS score was stronger in the concussion group (  r  \u2010values range: 0.359\u20130.568) compared to the control group (  r  \u2010values range: 0.285\u20130.359). There was a statistically significant relationship between DAN\u2013right lateral premotor functional connectivity (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.041), DAN\u2013left/right mPFC connectivity (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05), DAN\u2013left/right primary motor cortex (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05), DAN\u2013right SMC (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05), and total PANESS score in the concussion group and not in the control group. The DAN\u2013motor pairs by group multiple regression models accounting for sex and competition level did not statistically significantly predict total PANESS score (see Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThis study examined resting\u2010state functional connectivity and its relationship to subtle motor function as measured by the PANESS in adolescents clinically recovered from concussion and never\u2010concussed controls. Consistent with our hypothesis, compared to controls, adolescents with a history of concussion showed greater subtle motor deficits and increased intrinsic DMN\u2013motor connectivity. The finding of greater subtle motor deficits in adolescents with a history of concussion compared to controls is consistent with prior findings in a cohort that included these participants (Crasta, Raja, et al.,\u00a0 ). More anomalous DMN\u2013motor connectivity patterns were associated with greater subtle motor deficits. This study provides the first evaluation of the association between altered network connectivity and subtle motor function in adolescents recovered from concussion. \n\nConsistent with literature showing global hyper\u2010connectivity patterns between brain networks (Churchill et al.,\u00a0 ,  ; Manning,\u00a0 ) as well as previous findings specific to the motor network post\u2010concussion (Schmidt et al.,\u00a0 ; Trofimova et al.,\u00a0 ), adolescents clinically recovered from concussion showed increased functional DMN\u2013left lateral premotor cortex connectivity compared to controls. Regardless of the covariates included, there were cluster\u2010level group differences in connectivity between DMN and right and left lateral premotor regions, suggesting that this is an important region bilaterally. Our results also align with previous findings of increased DMN\u2013motor connectivity in adolescents with mild\u2010complicated and moderate TBI (Risen et al.,\u00a0 ). Borich and colleagues also showed increased resting\u2010state functional connectivity within the DMN and frontal networks in adolescents post\u2010concussion during the sub\u2010acute phase (Borich et al.,\u00a0 ). Our results are consistent with findings from Churchill and colleagues indicating increased connectivity in motor regions beyond the acute symptomatic stage in adolescents post\u2010concussion (Churchill et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nOur behavioral finding of greater motor deficits on the PANESS is consistent with studies showing impaired motor learning in athletes with a history of concussion (Cantarero et al.,\u00a0 ; De Beaumont et al.,\u00a0 ). Additionally, our brain\u2013behavior finding showing the association between the PANESS and altered DMN\u2013left/right lateral premotor cortex connectivity is consistent with the role of the lateral premotor cortex in motor learning (Hardwick et al.,\u00a0 ). A possible explanation of this brain\u2013behavior relationship may be related to the \u201cdefault mode interference\u201d phenomenon, which posits that reduced DMN deactivation (increased interference) may lead to ineffective task performance and lapses in attention (Mayer et al.,\u00a0 ; Sonuga\u2010Barke & Castellanos,\u00a0 ; van der Horn et al.,\u00a0 ). Studies in individuals with concussions have shown this effect, such that adults with persisting symptoms after concussion showed greater connectivity between the DMN and frontal regions, especially during difficult tasks compared to those without symptoms (van der Horn et al.,\u00a0 ). Collegiate athletes with a history of concussion also show chronic deficits in motor learning, especially with retention (Cantarero et al.,\u00a0 ). Overall, this suggests that the motor constructs examined by the PANESS including subtle motor function and motor learning may be particularly sensitive to long\u2010term neurophysiological recovery following a pediatric concussion; however, further research is required to validate these findings. There was an indication of group\u2010level differences when informally comparing marginal group results. However, interaction tests were not significant. Future studies with larger sample sizes would be warranted to fully investigate these potential interactions. \n\nStrikingly, greater DAN to motor network connectivity was associated with worse motor performance on the PANESS across all participants. Although we did not detect group differences in DAN\u2013motor network synchrony, our results suggest that the attention network may play a role in motor function recovery post\u2010concussion. Our findings are in contrast to a study wherein increased DAN\u2013motor connectivity was associated with better motor performance in children with more severe TBI (Risen et al.,\u00a0 ). While both studies have relatively small sample sizes, this could potentially indicate that brain\u2013behavior relationships may be different based on the severity of TBI. Stronger connectivity between the DMN and attention/executive networks has been linked to an overall disruption in high\u2010level attention processes (Borich et al.,\u00a0 ), cognitive complaints (Mayer et al.,\u00a0 ), and is suggestive of issues with network switching (van der Horn et al.,\u00a0 ). In milder brain injuries like concussions, this reallocation of resources may be a marker of relatively more severe injury and be detrimental to behavioral performance (Churchill et al.,\u00a0 ; Viano et al.,\u00a0 ). In contrast, in more severe TBI, hyper\u2010connectivity may suggest the availability of neural resources and may function as an adaptive response (Hillary et al.,\u00a0 ). It is also plausible that DAN to motor network connectivity reflects a compensatory increase in functional connectivity secondary to loss of structural connectivity (Palacios et al.,\u00a0 ; Virji\u2010Babul et al.,\u00a0 ). For future research, it will be helpful to include multi\u2010modal neuroimaging methods such as fMRI and diffusion\u2010tensor imaging to shed more light on neural recovery processes following concussions and to assess changes in functional connectivity longitudinally during the course of clinical recovery and beyond. Future work will also benefit from the incorporation of a reference group who have not clinically recovered (either through a longitudinal design monitoring youth from the point of injury or through inclusion of a reference group of participants with persisting symptoms following concussion). Future studies should also seek to understand if youth with concussion that demonstrate anomalous functional connectivity and neuromotor performance are more likely to sustain secondary injuries such as repeated concussions and orthopedic injuries. \n\nWe acknowledge the limitations associated with the unbalanced representation of competition level among the MC post\u2010concussion group; however, our results showed general stability regardless of covariates included. Given our modest sample size, the results should be considered preliminary and require replication in larger cohorts of adolescents who have clinically recovered following concussion. In addition, multiple comparisons remain an issue. However, our approach reduced comparisons to a small number of ROI pairs of interest, which evidenced complementary results. \n\nIn summary, the persistence of subtle motor deficits and related altered functional connectivity in adolescents clinically recovered from concussion highlights the need for more investigation of subtle persisting impairments which may be of clinical relevance for later outcomes after apparent recovery and may inform the development of rehabilitative interventions. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nStacy J.
