The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine consistent changes of regional brain functions in T2DM  Since the indicators obtained using varied post-processing methods reflect different neurophysiological and pathological characteristics, we further conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) of the two categories of neuroimaging literature, which were grouped according to similar data processing methods: one group included regional homogeneity (ReHo), independent component analysis (ICA), and degree centrality (DC) studies, while the other group summarized the literature on amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and cerebral blood flow (CBF). The final meta-analysis included 23 eligible trials with 27 data sets. Compared with the healthy control group, when neuroimaging studies were combined with ReHo, ICA, and DC measurements, the brain activity of the right Rolandic operculum, right supramarginal gyrus, and right superior temporal gyrus in T2DM patients decreased significantly. When neuroimaging studies were combined with ALFF and CBF measurements, there was no clear evidence of differences in the brain function between T2DM and HCs. T2DM patients have a series of spontaneous abnormal brain activities, mainly involving brain regions related to learning, memory, and emotion, which provide early biomarkers for clarifying the mechanism of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric disorders in diabetes. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=247071, PROSPERO [CRD42021247071].
