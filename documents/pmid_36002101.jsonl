We aim to identify the trans-diagnostic convergence of neuroimaging abnormalities underlying inhibitory control across psychiatric disorders. Inhibitory control tasks neuroimaging, including functional magnetic resonance imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography, and positron emission tomography articles published in PubMed and Web of Science before April 2020 comparing healthy controls with patients with several psychiatric disorders were searched. 146 experiments on 2653 patients with different disorders and 2764 control participants were included. Coordinates of case-control differences coded by diagnosis and inhibitory control components were analyzed using activation likelihood estimation. A robust trans-diagnostic pattern of aberrant brain activation in the bilateral cingulate gyri extending to medial frontal gyri, right insula, bilateral lentiform nuclei, right inferior frontal gyrus, right precuneus extending to inferior parietal lobule, and right supplementary motor area were detected. Frontostriatal pathways are the commonly disrupted neural circuits in the inhibitory control across psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, Patients showed aberrant activation in the dorsal frontal inhibitory system in cognitive inhibition, while in the frontostriatal system in response inhibition across disorders. Consistent with the Research Domain Criteria initiative, current findings show that psychiatric disorders may be productively formulated as a phenotype of trans-diagnostic neurocircuit disruption. Our results provide new insights for future research into mental disorders with inhibition-related dysfunctions.
