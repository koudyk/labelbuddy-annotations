ALE analysis revealed the ReHo increase in the brainstem and left thalamus, with no decreased area. Neither increased nor decreased regions were detected in FC and GMV of migraine patients. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe left thalamus and brainstem were the significantly activated regions of migraine. It is a meaningful insights into the pathophysiology of migraine. The consistent alterated brain areas of morphometrical and functional in migraine patients were far from reached based on current studies. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMigraine is a complex neurological dysfunction characterized by recurrent attacks and pulsating headaches susceptible to physical or environmental factors. Broad clinical symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia etc., have been complained by suffers, with a headache duration ranging from 4 to 72 h ( ). The estimated 1-year prevalence of migraine is about 15%, with a female-to-male ratio of 3:1 ( ). \n\nHowever, the underlying neuroimaging alterations in migraine patients have previously been studied using functional and structural MRI techniques, with inconsistent conclusions ( \u2013 ). Some studies reported the increased functional connectivity (FC) in prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) ( ), superior frontal gyrus, and temporal pole ( ), while decreased FC in periaqueductal gray (PAG) ( ), hypothalamus ( ), ACC ( ), temporal lobe ( ), insular cortex ( ) and amygdala ( ). Among migraine patients, regional homogeneity (ReHo) was significantly increased in bilateral thalami, middle frontal gyrus and left insula ( ), and decreased in putamen ( ), cerebellum ( ), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) ( ). Meanwhile, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies suggested that brain gray matter volume (GMV) increased in PAG, bilateral fusiform gyri, and cingulate gyri ( ), and decreased in cerebellar culmen ( ), ACC, hippocampus ( ), and orbitofrontal cortex ( ). \n\nIf there are regions that both function and structure altered in migraine patients. Based on ReHo, amplitude low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and positron emission tomography (PET), meta-analysis demonstrated decreased activity in the angular gyrus, visual cortex, and cerebellum, while increased in the caudate, thalamus, pons, and prefrontal cortex ( ). On the other hand, GMV decrease in posterior insular-opercular regions, the bilateral prefrontal cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex were revealed with AES-SDM ( ,  ). It is frustrating that a consistent conclusion was not drawn. Meanwhile, there still a lacks meta-analysis on the brain FC alterations in migraine patients. As more studies on the brain structure and function alterations in migraine patients have been published, it is urgent to perform a meta-analysis to draw a comprehensive conclusion including functional and structural studies. \n\nTherefore, we conduct the current neuroimaging meta-analysis on brain structure and function changes in migraine patients, with the hope of drawing a solid conclusion. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nThis study was registered on the PROSPERO ( ), with the registration number CRD42021257300. \n\n### Search strategy \n  \nA systematic literature search was conducted in the database of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and MEDLINE from inception to Sept 2022, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) ( ). The subject terms and keywords, (\u201cmigraine\u201d OR \u201cprimary headache\u201d) AND (\u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cneuroimaging\u201d OR \u201cfMRI\u201d) AND (\u201cstructure\u201d OR \u201cvoxel-based morphometry\u201d OR \u201cmorphometrical\u201d OR \u201cfunctional connectivity\u201d OR \u201cregional homogeneity\u201d OR \u201cfunction\u201d), were used to identify candidate VBM and rs-fMRI studies. Then, manual screening was conducted in the references of the retrieved studies and reviews. \n\n\n### Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nStudies that meet the following criteria were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis: (1) migraine patients diagnosed according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) ( ); (2) MRI studies employed morphometric approaches of VBM, or functional metrics of FC and ReHo; (3) seed-based FC to whole-brain compared patients with migraine with health controls (HC) group; (4) coordinates were reported in Montreal Neurological Institute space (MNI), or Talairach space, and (5) peer-reviewed. Multiple papers published by the same author were included following the criteria: including the largest number of participants, latest published ones, and reported coordinates underwent stringent correction. \n\nExclusion criteria were as follows: (1) no HC group, (2) study was neither VBM nor FC and ReHo, (3) studies on the region of interest (ROI)-ROI, seed-ROI or independent component analysis (ICA), (4) intervention studies (pre/post-treatment contrasts such as transcranial magnetic stimulation or acupuncture), (5) seed-points or peak effect coordinates could not be retrieved, or (6) other types of migraine (e.g., vestibular migraine) and studies for comorbidities ( ). We also excluded those studies that adopted lax statistical methods, like small volume correction (SVC) and uncorrected multiple comparisons. \n  \nThe flowchart of literature screening. \n  \n\n### Data extraction \n  \nArticles retrieval, assessment, and data extraction were independently implemented by two authors (CZH and SJT) according to the data extraction protocol. Any vagueness or disagreements were discussed with a third author (CYL), and a consensus was reached. The data information was sequentially collected, such as author, published year, sample size, characteristics of participants (e.g., age, gender, disease duration, and attacks), classification of migraine, and technical details (MRI scanner, seed regions, and correction methods, etc.). The peak coordinates of included studies were edited as available files according to the guidelines of AES-SDM 5.15 ( ) ( ) or ALE 3.02 ( ) ( ). Talairach coordinates were translated into MNI   via   a toolbox provided by Ginger ALE. \n\n\n### Literature quality assessment \n  \nThere is no consensus on the quality evaluation of neuroimaging studies up to now. We performed a customized checklist to assess the quality of included studies based on the assessment items of the Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale ( ). The detailed items and scores of included studies are listed in  ,  . \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis \n  \nALE evaluated the significant convergence between peak effect foci from different trials (e.g., migraine > controls, migraine < controls) for a given study in comparison with a random distribution of foci. It treated reported significant foci as spatial probability distributions centered on given coordinates rather than as single points. ALE assesses the cumulative probabilities of each voxel based on reported foci. ALE map was acquired after calculating the union probabilities of each voxel. The true convergence of foci and random clustering was tested by permutation tests. Based on the sample size and random effect model, the likelihood of consensus among different experiments is attained. Each focus is modeled as the center of a Gaussian probability distribution. Then, the modeled activation (MA) map for each study is generated. We employed the recommendation setting of cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) (  p   < 0.05) to carry out multiple comparisons, using an initial cluster threshold of uncorrected   p   < 0.001, and permutation tests were 5,000 ( ). \n\n\n### Sensitivity analysis \n  \nTo assess the reliability and replicability of main resutls, we conducted a jackknife sensitivity analysis. The method was to repeat the process of removing one study and performing the others with the same meta-analysis at same threshold. If the main results remains significant in all or most of the combinations of the analysis, then it was regarded as rigorous. \n\n\n### Subgroup analysis \n  \nSubgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the consistency of findings and to eliminate latent factors affecting main results. We conducted subgroup analysis of patients with migraine without aura to exclud clinical and methodological heterogeniety. \n\n\n\n## Result \n  \nThirty-nine MRI studies were included in this analysis, covering 11 VBM ( ), 16 FC ( ), and 9 ReHo studies ( ). It was comprised of 1,355 migraine patients (314 males and 1,041 females) and 1,149 (305 males and 844 females) HCs. Among them, VBM studies recruited 430 migraine patients (120 males, 328 females), and 317 HCs (93 males, 224 females); ReHo studies enrolled 337 migraine patients (77 males, 260 females), and 288 HCs (69 males, 219 females); FC studies included 588 migraine patients (135 males, 453 females), and 544 HCs (143 males, 401 females). All included structural and functional studies were performed statistical analyses for age and sex of included patients and controls (  t  -test or ANOVA,   p   < 0.05), individually. There were no significant differences in age and ratio of gender between migraine and HC, when the data were independently assessed. The preprocessing of fMRI images in all studies was performed by several steps, such as slice timing, realigning, normalizing, regressing nuisance covariates, filtering, and smoothing. \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of migraine in the VBM studies. \n  \nACC, anterior cingulate cortex; MWA, migraine with aura; MWoA, migraine without aura; EM, episodic migraine; CM, chronic migraine; FWHM, full width at half maximum; GRF, Gaussian random field theory; FEW, family wise error; FDR, false detect rate; SVC, small volume correction; mM, menstrual migraine; LF, low frequency; HF, high frequency; PAG, periaqueductal gray; LC, locus ceruleus; MRN, median raphe nuclei; dlPFC, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; PHG, parahippocampal gyrus; ICHD-3 beta, international classification of headache disorders, 3rd edition (beta version); PCG, postcentral gyrus; HIS, international headache society; MTG, middle temporal gyrus; OFC, orbitofrontal cortex; T, Tesla; VBM, voxel-based morphometry. \n    \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of FC studies in migraine. \n  \nACC: anterior cingulate cortex; AI: anterior insula; aMCC: anterior midcingulate; ADN: anterior dorsal thalamic nucleus; FC: functional connectivity; GMM: Gaussian Mixture Modeling; GMM: Gaussian Mixture Modeling GRF: Gaussian random field; IPL: inferior parietal lobule; IHS: International Headache Society; ITG: inferior temporal gyrus; LG: lingual gyrus; LGN: lateral geniculate nucleus; MCC: middle cingulum cortex; MFG: middle frontal gyrus; MOG: middle occipital gyrus; mPFC: medial prefrontal cortex; MPC: midline posterior cingulate; MRN: median raphe nuclei; MrD: marginal division of neostriatum; NA: not available; NCF: nucleus cuneiformis; OFC: orbitofrontal cortex; PAG: periaqueductal gray; PCC: posterior cingulate cortex; PCL: paracentral lobule; PHG: parahippocampal gyrus; RN: red nucleus; SFG: superior frontal gyrus; SMA: supplementary motor area; SN: substantia nigra; STG: superior temporal gyrus; THA: thalamus; VPN: ventral posterior nucleus. \n    \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of migraine in the ReHo studies. \n  \nST, short-term; LT, long-term.

No clusters were above the threshold. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first study adopting functional and structural fMRI metrics to verify brain alterations (VBM, FC, and ReHo) in migraine patients. The solid conclusion is that the ReHo values of left thalamus and brainstem were consistently increased. While GMV and FC were not illustrated alterations in migraine in terms of current evidence. \n\nMigraine is associated with various central nervous system disorders ( ). Profoundly prolonged duration and recurrently attacked headache are the main complaints of migraine suffers ( ). Thalamus is thought to have an essential role in the pathophysiology of migraine and has been investigated extensively ( \u2013 ). Meanwhile, the migraine genesis is more likely within brainstem, involving dysfunction and plasticity changes ( ). \n\nIn migraine patients, pain information is transmitted from the meninges to the brain   via   the trigeminovascular pathway starting from trigeminal ganglion neurons ( ). Specifically, the spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpV) neurons convey nociceptive signals to the brainstem (such as periaqueductal gray, reticular formation), hypothalamic, and basal ganglia. Then, the relay thalamic neurons project to the somatosensory, insular, motor, parietal association, auditory, visual, and olfactory cortices to construct the specific properties of migraine pain ( ), for instance, nausea, vomiting, lacrimation, anxiety, and hypothalamic-regulated functions like appetite loosing and fatigue ( ). \n\nReHo is specialized in explore local connectivity in a specific region by characterizing its relationship with nearby voxels in a specific region ( ). Meta-regression analysis has indicated that migraine patients' visual analog scale score was associated with increased brain activity in the left thalamus ( ). Using different meta-analysis method and sensitivity analysis, we also concluded that the left thalamus and brainstem of migraine patients were more spontaneous activated than HCs. Based on these evidences, we speculate that left thalamus and brainstem maybe the biological markers of nociceptive information transmission in frequent migraine attacks. \n\nWe postulated that if there is a certain region affected by long-term migraine, the functional connectivity changes of cerebral regions could be convergent at ones regardless of the chosen of the seed-points. Totally, 16 FC studies were included in this study. Among them, the seed-points were distributed the middle frontal gyrus ( ), precuneus ( ), PAG ( ,  ,  ), insulas ( ,  ,  ), thalamus ( ,  ,  ), pons ( ,  ), lateral geniculate nucleus ( ), amygdala ( ), and lingual gyrus ( ). Although, the regions exhibited FC alteration among those studies, involving cortex about pain processing, visual, auditory, affective, and cognitive evaluation, there is no solid conclusion of pain information projecting of migraine temporarily according to our analysis. \n\nMeanwhiles, the GMV changes of migraine assessed by VBM were heterogeneous between previous studies and meta-analysis ( \u2013 ). Now, a tendentious consensus of no structural brain alterations is more acceptable by researchers ( ,  ). Furthermore, after rigorous literature screening, no morphometrical changes were detected with meta-analysis using different software. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe first quantitative coordinates meta-analysis of whole-brain neuroimaging studies for migraine that synthesized functional and structural MRI metrics, with the aim of providing the most comprehensive insights into brain impairments of migraine patients. Our meta-analysis suggested spontaneous cerebral activity in the left thalamus and brainstem, with no FC and GMV alterations. The findings may be served as the brain dysfunction clue of the underlying pathophysiology of migraine. In addition, neuroimaging meta-analysis, for reliable and robustness results, rigorous literature screening is prerequisite. \n\n\n## Limitation \n  \nFirstly, the heterogeneity analysis, and correlation analysis were not carried out due to the ALE software restriction. The number of included studies was insufficient to perform subgroup analysis. Secondly, unpublished studies (\u201cgray studies\u201d) were not included in our meta-analysis, which inevitably leads to publication bias. And the coordinates-based meta-analysis also has inherently biased, as it employs pooled stereotactic coordinates that are statistically significantly different, rather than raw data. Thirdly, this meta-analysis was limited to seed-based to whole-brain fMRI studies of FC, the studies using independent component analysis (ICA) and positron emission tomography (PET) approach not included. \n\n\n## Strengths and limitations of this study \n    \nFunctional and structural changes were evaluated simultaneously. \n  \nRobust results were attributed to the rigorous processing analyses. \n  \nMore studies are needed to verify the changes in GMV. \n  \n\n## Author contributions \n  \nZ-HC, Y-LC, J-TS, Y-TL, and CZ devoted to this study equally as the co-first authors.
