The cognitive level of patients was assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale. The fractional amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuation (fALFF) was applied to measure the strength of spontaneous brain activity. Correlation analysis and between\u2010group comparisons of fMRI data were conducted using Rest 1.8. By overlaying cognitively characterized brain regions and defining regions of interest (ROIs) based on their spatial distribution for subsequent cognitive stratification studies. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 58 PD patients were enrolled in this study. They were divided into three groups: normal cognition (NC) group (27 patients, average MoCA was 27.96), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group (21 patients, average MoCA was 23.52), and severe cognitive impairment (SCI) group (10 patients, average MoCA was 17.3). It is noteworthy to mention that those within the SCI group exhibited the most advanced chronological age, with an average of 74.4\u2009years, whereas the MCI group displayed a higher prevalence of male participants at 85.7%. It was found hippocampal regions were a stable representative brain region of cognition according to the correlation analysis between the fALFF of the whole brain and cognition, and the comparison of fALFF between different cognitive groups. The parahippocampal gyrus was the only region with statistically significant differences in fALFF among the three cognitive groups, and it was also the only brain region to identify MCI from NC, with an AUC of 0.673. The paracentral lobule, postcentral gyrus was the region that identified SCI from NC, with an AUC of 0.941. The midbrain, hippocampus, and parahippocampa gyrus was the region that identified SCI from MCI, with an AUC of 0.926. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe parahippocampal gyrus was the potential brain region for recognizing cognitive impairment in PD, specifically for identifying MCI. Thus, the fALFF of parahippocampal gyrus is expected to contribute to future study as a multimodal fingerprint for early warning. \n\n  \nSpontaneous brain activity (fractional amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuation \u2212 fALFF) in the hippocampal regions could reveal cognitive levels in patients with Parkinson's disease to differentiate normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and severe cognitive impairment.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nParkinson's disease (PD) is a clinically common neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor symptoms, including tremors, bradykinesia, and rigidity. In addition to motor symptoms, non\u2010motor symptoms are considered to precede motor symptoms, affecting the quality of life. ,   Common non\u2010motor symptoms of PD include dementia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, autonomic failure, and sensory impairments. Dementia is most detrimental to the quality of life and increases mortality rates. ,   Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a transitional stage between normal state and full\u2010blown dementia and is also a powerful predictor of dementia. ,  \n\nCurrently, the diagnostic criteria for PD\u2010MCI still need further revision and refinement. ,  ,  ,   Therefore, the research on PD\u2010MCI is increasing rapidly, and exploring the characteristics of different cognitive states in PD and the laws of transition between states is the focus of disease pathology research, especially finding the predictors of PD\u2010MCI to provide the theoretical reference for early treatment and rehabilitation. \n\nThe research found that demographic indicators of gender were a critical factor, that men were more likely to develop cognitive impairment, and that characteristics of cognitive impairment differed between genders.  Other factors included genotype, in which the Catechol\u2010O\u2010methyltransferase genotype was related to executive\u2010attention function ,   and the apolipoprotein E genotype was related to cognitive decline. \n\nIn the study of radiological imaging predictive factors, the cross\u2010sectional analysis suggested that PD\u2010MCI was more likely to develop brain atrophy, occurring in areas such as the left superior frontal gyrus, superior temporal lobe, insula,  right supramarginal gyrus, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and midcingulate cortex.  Cerebral small vessel disease and its imaging characteristics were related to gait, and cognition in PD patients. It was found white matter hyperintensity was associated with slow gait speed, decreased cadence, increased stride time, and increased stance phase time. The presence of lacune was associated with poor attention and impaired executive function. It was demonstrated white matter hyperintensity, number of lacunes, and microbleeds were positively correlated with the severity of motor, cognitive, and emotional impairments, while the perivascular space in the basal ganglia was only correlated with cognitive impairments. Moreover, monitoring cerebral blood flow by arterial spin labeling (ASL)\u2010MRI, researchers found hypoperfusion was a predictor of cognitive impairment in PD patients. ,   The above studies revealed multidimensional imaging markers of comorbid cognitive impairment in PD. However, the relationship between spontaneous brain activity and comorbid cognitive impairment in PD is unclear. \n\nThe emerging resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance (RS\u2010fMRI) technology has brought new methods for collecting brain neural activity. With the development of methodology, the proposal of fractional amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuations (fALFF) laid the foundation for characterizing neural activity. fALFF can be applied to analyze brain activity in the state of neurological diseases is widely used to explore the mechanism of neurological diseases, and has been found to have significant repeatability. In conclusion, this study used the RS\u2010fMRI method to detect the brain activity by fALFF in the cognitive brain regions in PD patients, and innovatively found the characteristics of cognitive stratification by comparing the differences in spontaneous brain activity between different cognitive groups. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe fMRI data were obtained from the brain imaging shared database \u2212 OpenNeuro ( ), with dataset number ds004392. This was a resting state functional imaging dataset comprising PD patients with different cognitive levels. In addition, the data also included baseline information such as cognitive scores (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA), age, gender, handedness, and education level. The dataset included patients with the following features: (1) Patients diagnosed with PD; (2) Age: 55\u201389\u2009years; (3) Patients with different cognitive levels: MoCA 9\u201330; (4) years of education level: 7\u201324\u2009years. \n\n\n### Cognitive level categorization \n  \nThe MoCA was primarily utilized for evaluating cognitive function in elderly individuals and patients with neurological disorders by assessing attention, memory, language, and spatial abilities, with a total score of 30 points.  MoCA played a crucial role in the early detection of cognitive impairments, diagnosis of MCI, and evaluation of treatment efficacy. According to the distribution of MoCA, cognitive levels were classified into NC group (MoCA > 25), MCI group (MoCA 22\u201324), and severe cognitive impairment (SCI) group (MoCA < 22). ,  ,  ,   Furthermore, MCI together with SCI groups is considered to be the cognitively abnormal group. \n\n\n### Parameters of RS\u2010fMRI \n  \nRS\u2010fMRI scans were performed by using a 3.0 Tesla system (GE Medical Systems, ModelName: Signa HDxt) with gradient echo planar (percent phase field view\u2009=\u2009100, flip angle\u2009=\u200970\u00b0, echo time\u2009=\u200928\u2009ms, repetition time\u2009=\u20092000\u2009ms, total readout time: 32.76\u2009ms, pixel bandwidth\u2009=\u20097812.5; matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, slice thickness\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009mm, and spacing between slices 4\u2009mm). \n\nIn addition, a 3D T1\u2010weighted image was acquired covering the whole brain (percent phase field view\u2009=\u2009100, flip angle =10\u00b0, echo time\u2009=\u20092.988\u2009ms, repetition time\u2009=\u200910.02\u2009ms, pixel bandwidth\u2009=\u2009122.109, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm, and spacing between slices\u2009=\u20091). \n\n\n### Image data pre\u2010processing \n  \nThe MATLAB 2016b software with the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 12,  ) package was used for pre\u2010processing the resting state fMRI data. The first 10 volumes were discarded to eliminate the machine instability interference.  In further processing, slice timing, head motion correction (Friston 24), segment, spatial normalization to a Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template (resampling voxel size\u2009=\u20093\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm), smoothing (Gauss kernel of 4\u2009mm with full width and half height), and linear trend removal were performed. \n\n\n### fMRI data post\u2010processing \n  \nRest 1.8 ( ) software was applied for further processing. The time series of each voxel was transformed into the frequency domain and a power spectrum was then obtained. The square root of the power spectrum was calculated at each frequency and the average square root of the power spectrum within the frequency band of 0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz was retained as the amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuation (ALFF).  Additionally, fALFF was defined as the ratio of the power of each frequency at the low\u2010frequency range (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz) to that of the entire detectable frequency range (0\u20130.25\u2009Hz).  The fALFF could accurately reflect the amplitude levels of brain regions within a specific frequency band, reducing inter\u2010individual differences and the influence of global signals.  Simultaneously, fALFF mitigates interference from physiological sources like heartbeat and respiration as it normalizes the amplitude for every frequency band.  Therefore, fALFF was selected to enhance data reliability and interpretability to investigate the correlation between spontaneous brain activity and cognition. \n\nThe impact of confounding variables on the outcomes was also elucidated in subsequent analyses, predominantly by adjusting for confounding variables (such as age, gender, handedness, education level) versus not making any adjustments. First, voxel\u2010based correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the association between fALFF and MoCA to identify brain regions associated with cognitive impairment (AlphaSim corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.01, cluster size >19 voxels). Second, one\u2010way ANOVA and post hoc analyses were applied to compare the differences in brain activity between three cognitive groups (AlphaSim corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.01, cluster size >19 voxels). Third, based on the prior knowledge of hippocampus and cognition, we performed correlation analysis between fALFF and MoCA for hippocampal regions to further screen cognitive representative regions of patients with PD. Fourth, a two\u2010sample   t  \u2010test was used to compare the differences in brain activity in the hippocampal region between the cognitively abnormal and the NC groups. Considering the smaller voxel levels in the hippocampal region, we used a relatively loose correction (AlphaSim corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.01, cluster size >1 voxel) aimed at improving the sensitivity of the results. Subsequently, Anchored neurocognitive brain regions from the first three steps were overlapped to generate independent regions of interest (ROI) based on their spatial distribution in a sequential manner. Finally, the fALFF between the three cognitive groups was extracted, based on ROIs from overall and triple group level, for subsequent between\u2010group identification. \n\n\n### Routine statistical analyses \n  \nThe statistical analysis and graphical representation were conducted using SPSS 26 ( ), MedCalc ( ), and GraphPad Prism 9.5 ( ). Initially, the normality of the continuous variables was assessed through the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test (SPSS 26). If the distribution was found to be normal, inter\u2010group comparisons were performed using two\u2010sample   t  \u2010test or one\u2010way analysis of variance with post\u2010hoc pair\u2010wise comparisons, reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SPSS 26 and GraphPad Prism 9.5). In cases of non\u2010normal distribution, the Kruskal\u2010Wallis test was utilized, and the results were presented as median and quartiles (SPSS 26). The count data were compared using the Chi\u2010square test (SPSS 26). \n\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized for constructing a predictive measure (MedCalc). The discriminative capability of fALFF was assessed by computing the area under the ROC curve (AUC). An AUC value of 1.0 denotes perfect discrimination, while an AUC value of 0.5 implies a lack of discriminative ability. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Demographic analysis \n  \nA total of 58 PD patients were enrolled in this study, with an average age of 70.03\u2009years, predominantly male, accounting for 67.2% (39 patients), and predominantly right\u2010handed, accounting for 87.9% (51 patients). The education level was 16.21\u2009years, and the average cognitive score (MoCA) was 24.52. According to the MoCA, patients were divided into three groups: NC group (27 patients, average MoCA was 27.96), MCI group (21 patients, average MoCA was 23.52), and SCI group (10 patients, average MoCA was 17.3). Patients with SCI were the oldest at 74.4\u2009years in three cognitive groups. In terms of gender, patients with MCI had a higher proportion of males (85.7%) than other groups. There was no significant difference in the education level and the proportion of right\u2010handed in the three cognitive groups (Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nBaseline characteristics of patients with PD. \n    \n\n### Correlation analysis between fALFF of whole brain and cognition in PD patients \n  \nWe analyzed the correlation between whole brain fALFF by voxels and MoCA in PD patients.

We found no statistically significant difference in fALFF between PD patients with MCI and NC, regardless of adjustment for confounding factors (Figure\u00a0 ). \n\nWhen comparing PD patients with SCI and NC, without adjusting for confounding factors, there were differences in fALFF including Brainstem, Midbrain, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Brodmann area 34, Limbic Lobe, Mammillary Bod, Hippocampus, Occipital Lobe, Precuneus, Frontal Lobe, Brodmann area 4, Paracentral Lobule, Postcentral Gyrus (Figure\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ).

Related regions in the hippocampus after adjusting confounding factors. \n  \n\n### Differences in hippocampal fALFF between the cognitively abnormal and the NC groups \n  \nThe study found that the cognitive level of PD patients could be effectively characterized by their spontaneous brain activity in the hippocampus region. To reveal the baseline level of spontaneous brain activity in the hippocampus of the PD patients with NC, we further compared the differences in fALFF in the hippocampus region between NC and cognitively abnormal patients and quantified the fALFF values. Specifically, Figure\u00a0  presents the fALFF\u2010reduced (Figure\u00a0 ) and \u2010enhanced (Figure\u00a0 ) brain regions of patients with cognitively abnormal, both uncorrected (Figure\u00a0 ) and corrected (Figure\u00a0 ) for confounders. The fALFF quantification showed that compared to the cognitively abnormal group, the NC group was 0.936\u2009\u00b1\u20090.015 vs. 0.918\u2009\u00b1\u20090.012 (Figure\u00a0 ) and 0.916\u2009\u00b1\u20090.029 vs. 0.937\u2009\u00b1\u20090.025 (Figure\u00a0 ), while corrected for confounders was 0.932\u2009\u00b1\u20090.014 vs. 0.915\u2009\u00b1\u20090.018 (Figure\u00a0 ) and 0.918\u2009\u00b1\u20090.019 vs. 0.936\u2009\u00b1\u20090.020 (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nQuantitative results of fALFF values reveal differences in spontaneous brain activity in the hippocampal region between the cognitively abnormal and the NC groups (*  p  \u2009<\u20090.05; fALFF, fractional amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuation).

When comparing PD patients with MCI and NC, there were differences in fALFF only including ROI 5. When comparing PD patients with SCI and NC, there were differences in fALFF of 8 regions including ROI 1, ROI 2, ROI 3, ROI 5, ROI 6, ROI 7, ROI 8 and ROI 10. When comparing PD patients with SCI and MCI, there were differences in fALFF of 7 regions including ROI 1, ROI 2, ROI 3, ROI 5, ROI 6, ROI 8, and ROI 10. ROI 5 was the only region with statistically significant differences in fALFF among the three cognitive groups. We found that ROI 5 had the highest fALFF in PD patients with NC and the lowest fALFF in patients with SCI. \n  \nComparison of fALFF of 10 ROIs between different cognitive groups; The order of   X  \u2010axis numbers corresponds to the order of ROIs (#*$  p  \u2009<\u20090.05; fALFF, fractional amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuation; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; SCI, severe cognitive impairment). \n  \n\n### The potential ability to identify cognitive impairment by ROIs \n  \nWe produce ROC\u2010AUC for the evaluation of the potential of ROIs to identify cognitive impairment. The AUC of fALFF of ROI 5 in distinguishing PD patients with MCI from NC was 0.673 (Figure\u00a0 ). The AUC of fALFF of ROI 1, ROI 2, ROI 3, ROI 5, ROI 6, ROI 7, ROI 8, ROI 10 in distinguishing PD patients with SCI from NC was 0.941, 0.772, 0.844, 0.920, 0.887, 0.857, 0.811, 0.800, respectively (Figure\u00a0 ). The AUC of fALFF of ROI 1, ROI 2, ROI 3, ROI 5, ROI 6, ROI 8, ROI 10 in distinguishing PD patients with SCI from MCI was 0.850, 0.910, 0.907, 0.869, 0.926, 0.776, 0.702, respectively (Figure\u00a0 ). The results revealed that parahippocampal gyrus (ROI 5) was the only region that identified PD patients with MCI and NC. The paracentral lobule, postcentral gyrus (ROI 1) was the best region that identified PD patients with SCI and NC, with an AUC of 0.941. The midbrain, hippocampus, and parahippocampa gyrus (ROI 6) was the best region that identified PD patients with SCI and MCI, with an AUC of 0.926. \n  \nThe potential ability of ROIs to identify between cognitive impairments (AUC: area under the curve).

The prevalence of dementia in PD patients was approximately 30%, with an incidence rate of 24.3/1000/year (95% confidence interval, 7.7\u201358).  Cognitive impairment was a manifestation in the early stage of dementia. Early detection and intervention of cognitive impairment could improve the quality of life of PD patients. ,   The research on brain activity associated with cognitive impairment of PD patients had important implications not only for the treatment and management of PD patients but also for further understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of PD. We used RS\u2010fMRI technology to collect brain activity parameters and applied network perspective to study the differences in brain activity in PD patients and find the early warning methods of PD\u2010MCI diagnosis. \n\nThe resting state was a state in which the brain was quiet, relaxed, and awake without performing cognitive tasks, and was the most basic and essential state of various complex states of the brain. The amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was a signal intensity of the blood oxygen level dependence (BOLD) sequence, which was used to describe the brain activity intensity of a single voxel and was an important feature in describing resting\u2010state images.  In order to reduce the sensitivity of ALFF to physiological noise and improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting spontaneous brain activity, the fractional amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuations (fALFF) was used in our research. \n\nFrom the perspective of brain activity, the use of ALFF to study non\u2010motor characteristics of PD patients was the hot research. In the study of anxiety characteristics in PD, Zhang study found that the fALFF of the left cerebellum, cerebellum posterior lobe, bilateral temporal cortex, and brainstem were higher, while the fALFF of bilateral inferior gyrus, bilateral basal ganglia areas, and left inferior parietal lobule were lower. Right, precuneus, and left caudate were correlated with the Hamilton Anxiety Scale.  By monitoring different brain regions ALFF, Criaud found that anxiety in PD was associated with the over\u2010activation of the amygdala and impaired inter\u2010relationship of regions involved in behavior (i.e. medial prefrontal cortex, insula) and motor control (i.e. basal ganglia).  The fALFF of bilateral putamen in PD patients with cognitive impairment was low, and the fALFF of left putamen was negatively correlated with the scores of PD\u2010MCI patients on the Movement Disorder Society\u2010Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Part III.  Monitoring ALFF in the bilateral primary motor cortex, the occipital cortex, the cerebellum, and the basal ganglia could predict the effect of dopaminergic therapy in PD patients. \n\n\n### The hippocampus is the important brain region for cognitive impairment in PD \n  \nWe analyzed the correlation between whole brain fALFF by voxels and cognition in PD patients. We found similar results in brain regions to previous studies, including the brainstem, hippocampal structure, limbic lobe, amygdala, occipital lobe, etc. ,   These results indicated that the above brain regions were closely related to cognition, attention, and memory. \n\nAbout 26.7% (18.9%\u201338.2%) of non\u2010demented PD patients were considered MCI,  and an even higher proportion of 40% was considered MCI.  In order to find the characteristic brain regions of PD\u2010MCI, we compared fALFF between PD patients with MCI and NC. Unfortunately, there was no statistically significant difference in fALFF between the two groups regardless of adjustment for confounding factors. A previous study demonstrated that compared with PD\u2010NC, PD\u2010MCI showed significantly increased ALFF in the right inferior frontal gyrus and left fusiform gyrus. \n\nResults found that hippocampal structure was not only a brain region related to cognition in PD patients but also a differential fALFF brain region in PD\u2010SCI. The hippocampus was closely related to learning, memory, emotional response, and other brain neural activities, and it was also an important target for research on cognitive impairment in PD patients because the temporal lobe has been identified as crucial for encoding and memory consolidation. ,  \n\nIn terms of magnetic resonance imaging, previous studies have demonstrated an association between hippocampal atrophy and MCI, as well as dementia. ,  ,   We innovatively analyzed the correlation between hippocampus fALFF by voxels and cognition in PD patients. It was found that regardless of confounding factors such as age, gender, handedness, education level, the hippocampal region was a stable representative brain region of cognition. \n\n\n### Feasibility of parahippocampal gyrus in predicting cognitive impairment in PD patients \n  \nThe purpose and methods of the current research were limited to speculating the effect of hippocampal atrophy on cognitive impairment in PD patients from the perspective of imaging. Gray matter atrophy of the hippocampus in PD patients resulted in impairment of functional connectivity, associated with different stages of cognitive impairment. ,   At present, some researchers explored the function of the hippocampus in PD patients from the perspective of brain activity. In the study of non\u2010motor symptoms of PD patients, Xu found an abnormal degree of centrality value in the hippocampus, and parahippocampus was observed separately in the conventional band and in the slow\u20104 band in PD with apathy, which confirmed the density of internal functional connections in hippocampal decreased.  Zi performed statistical differences in fALFF between patients in PD with excessive daytime sleepiness and analyzed the changes in the functional connection within the whole brain. It was found that the functional connectivity in the right hippocampus/parahippocampal was decreased, which resulted in damage to the dopaminergic circuits in the limbic system and subsequently inhibited the arousal mechanism.  However, Wang found that ALFF was elevated in the hippocampal structure in PD patients, and the hippocampus was an important structure for studying PD. \n\nBy comparing the fALFF of three cognitive groups, we found that the parahippocampal gyrus corresponding to the ROI 5 brain region was the different brain region of the three cognitive groups, and it was also the only brain region to identify MCI from NC. The parahippocampal gyrus was an important and active region of the limbic system, whose main functions included creating memories and recalling visual scenes. The research found that impaired function of the parahippocampal gyrus in PD\u2010MCI led to memory impairment  and showed that parahippocampal gyrus was essential for discovering connections between things and finding target objects. \n\nWe also found that the fALFF of parahippocampal gyrus of PD patients with SCI decreased more significantly than that of PD patients with MCI and NC. Previous evidence of hippocampal atrophy combined with our results of decreased parahippocampal gyrus activity might account for and predict the cognitive impairment in PD patients. Similarly, in the study of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease, it was found that abnormal brain activities in different parts of brain were related to pathological processes, which provided theoretical support for explaining the mechanism of cognitive impairment in imaging perspective. ,   The study found that sharp ripples are a manifestation of interactions between the hippocampus and cortical loops, which are closely linked to cognition and memory.  However, whether similar cognitive loop abnormalities exist in the PD co\u2010morbid cognitively impaired population warrants elucidation in terms of functional versus causal connectivity. \n\nIn order to explore the ability of brain activity in the parahippocampal gyrus to identify cognitive impairment, we found that the fALFF of parahippocampal gyrus of PD patients with MCI decreased more significantly than that of PD patients with SCI, which indicated that the brain activity of parahippocampal gyrus decreased, and its functional impairment was closely related to cognitive impairment. The fALFF of parahippocampal gyrus was 0.673 of AUC for identifying MCI and NC, 0.920 of AUC for identifying SCI and NC, and 0.869 of AUC for identifying SCI and MCI. From our perspective, the ability of fALFF of parahippocampal gyrus in identifying SCI from NC and MCI was acceptable, but the AUC for identifying the most important MCI from NC was 0.673, and its ability to identify was ordinary. This may be a potential biomarker worth combining with other indicators. \n\n\n### Limitations need to be discussed \n  \nFirstly, common and typical results of brain activity in PD patients were found based on the current sample size, but the robustness of the results was worth further verifying in a larger sample size. Secondly, brain activity in the parahippocampal gyrus was found to be an effective region for cognitive stratification in PD patients, but the brain regions (functional connectivity) affected by the abnormal parahippocampal gyrus activity were still unclear. It was suggested that regional homogeneity and functional connectivity methods were recommended to explore the relationship between brain regions in future studies. In addition, it is a consensus that structure determines function. From the perspective of brain activity, we showed the new discoveries, however, it was beneficial to further understand the pathological mechanism of PD patients evolving into different cognitive states by multimodal methods finding the changes between structure and function. Finally, abnormal brain activity in the parahippocampal gyrus could early identify PD\u2010MCI and became an early warning indicator, however, its ability to identify was ordinary. We suggested that in further research, it was necessary to combine other biochemical indicators, cerebral blood flow, and other parameters to comprehensively analyze. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nAccording to the research, the cognitive impairment of PD patients was associated with age and gender. By comparing the fALFF of three cognitive groups, discovery of the parahippocampal gyrus as an anchored differential brain region and it was also the only brain region to identify MCI from NC. It was revealed parahippocampal gyrus was the prospective brain region for recognizing cognitive impairment in PD, specifically for identifying MCI. In view of the ordinary ability of fALFF of parahippocampal gyrus to identify the most important MCI from NC, it was necessary to combine fALFF of parahippocampal gyrus with other indicators for early warning study. \n\n\n## FUNDING INFORMATION \n  \nThe funding was provided by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2022CDJYGRH\u2010015); the National Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing (CSTB2022NSCQ\u2010MSX1503); Medical Research Project of Science and Technology Bureau and Health Commission (2023MSXM076); and Project of Chongqing Key Laboratory of Emergency Medicine (2024RCCX01). \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT \n  \nThe authors report no conflicts of interest in this work. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10999557, "text_md5": "d982eb3c14db448863fb7397e2e63ece", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 116], "journal": [117, 134], "publication_year": [136, 140], "title": [151, 281], "keywords": [295, 434], "abstract": [447, 3071], "body": [3080, 37833]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 38584347, "doi": "10.1111/cns.14706", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10999557", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10999557"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10999557\">10999557</a>", "list_title": "PMC10999557  Spontaneous brain activity in the hippocampal regions could characterize cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease"}
