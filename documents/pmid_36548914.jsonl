However, there is no meta-analysis to assess the commonality and specificity activation concerning different subtypes of anxiety. Here, we used ALE to assess this. 29 studies revealed increased bilateral amygdala, anterior cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus activation in anxiety disorders during emotional stimuli. Moreover, we observed decreased activations in the posterior cingulate, lingual gyrus, and precuneus. In sub-analysis, although different anxiety showed dissimilar activations, the principal activations were observed in limbic lobe, which might indicate the limbic circuit was the main neural reflection of anxiety symptoms.
