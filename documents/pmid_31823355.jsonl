Although the survival rate has increased dramatically over the last decades, patients struggle with the adverse side effects of treatment. Treatment for ALL includes chemotherapy and irradiation - both of which are linked to cognitive impairments and alterations in central nervous system (CNS) structure and function detected by neuroimaging and in neurocognitive studies. The present article is a meta-analysis of the existing evidence for the mechanisms underlying changes in the CNS and neurocognitive function in ALL survivors after treatment. We found that compared with controls, ALL survivors develop: (i) cognitive sequelae in intelligence, academics, attention, memory, processing speed and executive function domains; (ii) decreased grey and white matter volume in cortical and several subcortical brain regions, with functional changes particularly in frontal regions and the hippocampus; (iii) neurocognitive impairments related to CNS changes; and (iv) reduction, but not resolution, of late neurocognitive sequelae in patients in whom prophylactic irradiation was replaced by systemic/intrathecal chemotherapy. Continued work with advanced functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques will hopefully allow the detection of early CNS changes as biomarkers to help guide early diagnosis and intervention for neurocognitive defects in patients with childhood ALL.
