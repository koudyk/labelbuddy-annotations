Some functional MRI (fMRI) research indicated that the frontoparietal network (FPN) could be an essential part of the pathophysiological mechanism of MCI. However, damaged FPN regions were not consistently reported, especially their interactions with other brain networks. We assessed the fMRI-specific anomalies of the FPN in MCI by analyzing brain regions with functional alterations. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched to screen neuroimaging studies exploring brain function alterations in the FPN in MCI using fMRI-related indexes, including the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, regional homogeneity, and functional connectivity. We integrated distinctive coordinates by activating likelihood estimation, visualizing abnormal functional regions, and concluding functional alterations of the FPN. We selected 29 studies and found specific changes in some brain regions of the FPN. These included the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insula, precuneus cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobule, middle temporal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Any abnormal alterations in these regions depicted interactions between the FPN and other networks. The study demonstrates specific fMRI neuroimaging alterations in brain regions of the FPN in MCI patients. This could provide a new perspective on identifying early-stage patients with targeted treatment programs. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42023432042, identifier: CRD42023432042. \n", "metadata": {"pmid": "37448688", "journal": "Frontiers in aging neuroscience", "publication_year": "2023", "title": "Functional MRI-specific alterations in frontoparietal network in mild cognitive impairment: an ALE meta-analysis.", "keywords": "activation likelihood estimation \namplitude of low-frequency fluctuation \nfrontoparietal network \nfunctional connectivity \nmild cognitive impairment \nregional homogeneity \n", "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) depicts a transitory phase between healthy elderly and the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with worsening cognitive impairment.
