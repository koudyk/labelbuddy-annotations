Publicly available meta\u2010analytic software was utilized to extract relevant fMRI data for the creation of an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) map and relevant parcellations from the human connectome project overlapping with the ALE data were identified for inclusion in our SN model.

A coordinate\u2010based meta\u2010analysis of the literature and subsequent tractographic analysis on identified regions demonstrate that the SN comprises three clusters of interconnected cortical regions that are extensively connected with both frontal aslant tract fibers and short local association fibers, generally forming a large cingulate and insular\u2010opercular system. These results may serve as an empirical basis for clinical translation in this region and for future studies that seek to expand our understanding of how specific neural substrates are involved in salience processing and guide subsequent human behavior.\n   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nIt has become increasingly clear that information presented to the brain is integrated and processed throughout large\u2010scale, interacting neural networks to drive subsequent thinking and behavior (Beckmann et\u00a0al.,  ; Dadario & Sughrue,  ; De Luca et\u00a0al.,  ; Thirion et\u00a0al.,  ). One specific large\u2010scale brain network, the salience network (SN), is believed to strongly contribute to how the other higher\u2010order brain networks interact, specifically by allocating cognitive resources between them and initiating appropriate network switching signals according to the type of stimuli presented (Dadario et\u00a0al.,  ; Menon & Uddin,  ). As such, the SN has been proposed to serve as a key transitory mediator between passive and active states of mind, and abnormal connectivity within this network is thought to form the underlying basis for a number of neuropsychiatric illnesses (Menon & Uddin,  ; Seeley et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nHowever, despite the increasing focus of research on the SN since its first characterization (Seeley et\u00a0al.,  ), there remains relatively little available information on the unique cortical and subcortical connectivity of this network (Seeley,  ). Such a lack of connectomic information inherently undermines our effective study of the essential functions of the salience system, which is tied to this anatomy, and also limits our understanding of psychopathology or clinical outcomes related to SN disruption (Rosen et\u00a0al.,  ). Indeed, several studies have improved our understanding of the cortical components of the SN, which is known to activate bilaterally in cortical areas consistent with the anterior insula and frontal operculum, as well as the cingulate gyrus (Menon & Uddin,  ; Uddin,  ). While important, existing descriptions of the SN continue to offer limited insight into its underlying structural connectivity and vastly undercharacterize the anatomic structure of the SN at a level of granularity required for precise hypothesis generation and comparison between studies to improve our characterization of this network and for effective clinical translation in these cortices. Newly published surface\u2010based, multimodal parcellation maps offer a potential remedy to improve the clinical applicability of connectomic models of the SN by providing a highly precise, established cortical atlas and nomenclature within which this network can be reiteratively refined with future work. \n\nThe Human Connectome Project (HCP) recently published a surface\u2010based, multimodal parcellation scheme of the human cerebrum suggesting 180 unique cortical areas within each cerebral hemisphere, which are also believed to be economically connected within organized neural networks (Glasser et\u00a0al.,  ). Such a detailed, precise atlas provides a common vernacular that allows us to systematically research different cortical regions and neural networks over time and then continually refine these findings in subsequent works with improved data comparisons between studies (Baker, Burks, Briggs, Conner, Glenn, Robbins, et\u00a0al.,  ; Moreno\u2010Ortega et\u00a0al.,  ; Robinson et\u00a0al.,  ). To provide anatomically precise results within this framework, studies assessing both the functional connectivity of the SN in combination with analyses of its structural interconnectedness may be able to create a precise model of the anatomic substrates of a network in the context of their known functional relevance (Catani et\u00a0al.,  ; Qi et\u00a0al.,  ; Ren et\u00a0al.,  ; Rykhlevskaia et al.,  ). However, focused studies of brain networks have often been limited in the scope of their findings due to their inclusion of highly specific tasks employed in isolation with a small number of subjects that are available. To combat these limitations, other groups, including our own, have begun to apply meta\u2010analytic software to aggregate large amounts of reported foci in the literature across numerous studies according to predefined search conditions that can target specific networks, such as the SN (Robinson et\u00a0al.,  ; Turkeltaub et\u00a0al.,  ). Furthermore, given that many voxelwise studies report their findings in standard stereotaxic space (  x, y, z  ), coordinate\u2010based activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta\u2010analyses in particular can analyze the coactivation maps across multiple studies and then assess regions of statistically likely convergence based on the known functions of a specific brain network (Robinson et\u00a0al.,  ). By utilizing coordinate\u2010based methodology, one can overcome the heterogeneous topographical nomenclature often described in the literature for homologous brain regions. This methodology has allowed us to precisely characterize many other brain networks in great detail, such as the default mode network (DMN); however, it has not been applied in a similar context for the SN to date and therefore remains a potentially advantageous avenue worth exploring (Milton et\u00a0al.,  ; Poologaindran et\u00a0al.,  ; Sandhu et\u00a0al.,  ; Sheets, Briggs, Dadario, et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nHere, we attempted to create a parcellation\u2010based, anatomically precise cortical model of the SN based on its structural and functional connectivity. Using a collection of open\u2010access, coordinate\u2010based meta\u2010analytic technology to generate ALEs based on healthy functional neuroimaging data, we identified the specific regions of interest (ROIs) likely involved in the SN. Then, we performed structural tractography analyses on these ROIs to determine their structural interconnectedness and the distinct white matter pathways within this network, and we report our findings in the anatomically precise, established HCP parcellation scheme   (Glasser et\u00a0al.,  ). Our goal is to provide a highly detailed connectivity model of the SN in a level of anatomical granularity and specificity that may serve as an empirical foundation to be refined in future studies that assess the essential functions of specific neural substrates of the SN, as well as for clinical translation in associated cortices (Briggs, Allan, et\u00a0al.,  ; Horn et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Literature search \n  \nPubMed and BrainMap Sleuth 2.4 (Fox & Lancaster,  ; Fox et\u00a0al.,  ; Laird et\u00a0al.,  ) were queried on August 1, 2017, and again on May 25, 2021, for resting\u2010state and task\u2010based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)\u00a0studies relevant to the SN according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\u2010Analyses. Our search strategy included the following algorithm: \u201csalience network OR cingulo\u2010opercular network AND fMRI.\u201d Studies were included in our analysis if they fulfilled the following search criteria: (a) peer\u2010reviewed publication, (b) task\u2010based or resting\u2010state fMRI study examining the SN, (c) based on whole\u2010brain, voxelwise imaging, (d) including standardized coordinate\u2010based results in the Talairach or Montreal Neuroimaging Institute (MNI) coordinate space, and (e) including at least one healthy human control cohort. Only coordinates from healthy subjects were utilized in our analysis. A total of 35 papers met the criteria for inclusion in this study, and the details of these studies are summarized in Table\u00a0 . Given that initial searches identified similar anatomical results for both resting\u2010state and task\u2010based studies (Smith et\u00a0al.,  ), our final searches included articles of both natures to improve the power of our findings and were filtered as appropriate. \n  \nSummary of the studies included in our meta\u2010analysis, including the task used, number of participants, what coordinate system was used, and the coordinates that were included to create the Activation Likelihood Estimation. MNI = Montreal Neurological Institute. \n    \n\n### Creation of 3D ROIs \n  \nIn the original HCP study, parcellation data were analyzed in the CIFTI file format. This is in contrast to traditional file formats, such as NIFTI, which denote regions based on volumetric dimensions (Larobina & Murino,  ). As a result, it was difficult to perform deterministic tractography using ROIs in CIFTI file format. To convert the parcellation files to volumetric coordinates, the grayordinate label parcellation fields were standardized to the three\u2010dimensional volumetric working spaces of diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI)\u00a0Studio (Carnegie Mellon,  ) using the structural imaging data provided by the HCP for each subject. This operation was performed utilizing previously created volumetric atlases that convert files from the Connectome Workbench to volumetric working masks in native structural space (Glasser et\u00a0al.,  ). Specifically, in this pipeline, FreeSurfer annotation files are transformed to each subject's space and then converted to volume masks utilizing a series of FreeSurfer commands we have described elsewhere in great detail (  for exact technical details see CJNeuroLab,  ; Sheets, Briggs, Young, et\u00a0al.,  ). Ultimately, this allowed us to convert all 180 parcellations from surface\u2010based coordinates to volumetric coordinates and thus perform deterministic fiber tractography. \n\n\n### ALE generation and identification of relevant cortical regions \n  \nPossible relevant cortical regions in the SN were identified in the literature with methodology reiteratively applied and refined by our team in other regions with great reproducibility (Baker, Burks, Briggs, Conner, Glenn, Sali, et\u00a0al.,  ; Kuiper et\u00a0al.,  ; Sandhu et\u00a0al.,  ; Sheets, Briggs, Dadario, et\u00a0al.,  ). With software publicly available through BrainMap ( ), we used the meta\u2010analytic software Ginger ALE 2.3.6 to extract the relevant fMRI data for the creation of an ALE (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ; Turkeltaub et\u00a0al.,  ). All Talairach coordinates identified during the literature review were converted to the MNI coordinate space using SPM Conversion in Ginger ALE. We subsequently performed a single study analysis using cluster\u2010level inference in the MNI coordinate space in accordance with common practices and recommendations from original authors (cluster level of 0.05, threshold permutations of 1000, uncorrected   p  \u2010value of .001 at voxel\u2010level as the cluster forming threshold; Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Turkeltaub et\u00a0al.,  ). The ALE coordinate data were displayed on an MNI\u2010normalized template brain using Multi\u2010image Analysis GUI (Mango) 4.0.1 (ric.uthscsa.edu/mango). To determine which parcellations should be included in our model, the preconstructed ROIs of the parcellations were overlaid on the ALE and assessed based on the amount of significant overlap. Specifically, the ROI was first placed on the ALE, and then a sphere with the specified volume for each set of coordinates was placed at the ALE coordinate. If a volume of the coordinates was not provided in a study, a default volume sphere with a   r  \u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0mm was utilized. Finally, the   percentage overlap   between the sphere and all overlapping parcel ROIs is calculated. The percentage overlap was calculated according to the formula (percentage overlap\u00a0=\u00a0volume of parcel ROI within ALE sphere/total volume of parcel ROI). Any parcellation that had more than 10% of its volume within the ALE cluster was included in further analyses of our SN model. \n\n\n### Network tractography \n  \nPublicly available imaging data from the HCP were obtained for this study from the HCP database ( , release Q3) to be utilized for structural analyses as elucidated elsewhere (Briggs, Lin, et\u00a0al.,  ; Briggs, Tanglay, et\u00a0al.,  ; Palejwala et\u00a0al.,  ; Sandhu et\u00a0al.,  ; Sheets, Briggs, Dadario, et\u00a0al.,  ; Tanglay et\u00a0al.,  ). Diffusion imaging with corresponding T1\u2010weighted images from 25 healthy, unrelated subjects was analyzed during fiber tracking analysis (subject IDs: 100307, 103414, 105115, 110411, 111312, 113619, 115320, 117112, 118730, 118932, 100408, 115320, 116524, 118730, 123925, 148335, 148840, 151526, 160123, 178950, 188347, 192540, 212318, 366446, 756055). Subjects were on average 29.5 years of age (SD\u00a0=\u00a03.8) and consisted of 13 females (52%) and 12 males (48%). \n\nAll brains were registered to the MNI coordinate space (Evans et\u00a0al.,  ), wherein imaging was warped to fit a standardized brain model comparison between subjects. Tractography was performed in DSI Studio (Carnegie Mellon,  ) using a ROI approach to initiate fiber tracking from a user\u2010defined seed region (Martino et\u00a0al.,  ). Specifically, a two\u2010ROI approach was used to isolate tracts, which included between any two cortical regions included in our model (Kamali et\u00a0al.,  ). We expand on the specific parameters of our tractographic analyses below. \n\nA multishell diffusion scheme was utilized on the diffusion scans consisting of three shells of   b  \u2010values equal to 1000, 2000, and 3000 s/mm .   b  \u2010values sampled in approximately 90 directions (Sotiropoulos et\u00a0al.,  ). According to DSI studio software, an automatic quality control routine assessed the   b  \u2010table for accuracy (Schilling et\u00a0al.,  ). The in\u2010plane resolution and slice thickness were both 1.25\u00a0mm. Diffusion data were reconstructed at high angular resolution by utilizing the   q  \u2010space diffeomorphic reconstruction methodology, which in turn allows the reconstruction of the spin distribution function (Yeh & Tseng,  ). The diffusion data were reconstructed using generalized q\u2010sampling imaging (GQI) with a diffusion sampling length ratio of 1.25 and an isotropic output resolution of 1\u00a0mm (Yeh et\u00a0al.,  ). Restricted diffusion was quantified using restricted diffusion imaging (Yeh et\u00a0al.,  ), and our tractography was completed utilizing a deterministic fiber tracking algorithm (Yeh et\u00a0al.,  ). A seeding region was placed in the whole brain, and the ending regions included our individual ROIs (see   for individual measurements per ROI). \n\nVoxels within each ROI were automatically traced with a maximum angular threshold of 45 degrees, and a step size of 1.5\u00a0mm was utilized. When a voxel was approached with no tract direction or a direction change of greater than 45 degrees, the tract was halted. The anisotropy threshold was selected at random according to the DSI studio software. According to recommended default settings for DSI Studio, tractography was terminated after reaching a maximum length of 800\u00a0mm, and any tracts with a tract length shorter than 1\u00a0mm were excluded. In some instances, exclusion ROIs were placed to exclude obvious spurious tracts that were not involved in the white matter pathway of interest. \n\n\n### Measuring connection strength \n  \nTo quantify the strength of the connections identified within the SN across all subjects, the tracking parameters used within DSI Studio were modified such that the program would count the total number of tracts between any two ROIs based on a random seed count of 1 million. Working sequentially through ROI pairs in the network, the number of tracts between regions was recorded for each subject after fiber tractography was terminated under these new conditions. \n\nTwo different values for the strengths of the connections within the SN were calculated to identify any interindividual variability: (1) the average number of tracts across all subjects and (2) the average number of tracts across only the subjects in which the connection was identified, which ultimately excluded subjects who did not demonstrate the specified connections. Based on the average amount of tracts across   all   subjects, a laterality index (LI) was calculated according to the formula (right tract averages \u2013 left tract averages)/(right tract averages + left tract averages). Furthermore, average left and right hemisphere tract volumes were compared with the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum test (uncorrected). \n\nThe purpose of our tractographic analyses was to demonstrate the possible connections between individual parcellations in anatomically fine, precise detail that can be readily applied for further study on specific connected neural substrates as well as for clinical translation. Therefore, while differences in connection strength likely occur based on interindividual differences, tractographic analyses were able to visualize the   major   white matter connections common to most individual SN networks. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nA total of 2220 studies were screened, and 182 full texts were assessed according to our search criteria. Ultimately, 35 studies were included in our meta\u2010analysis. \n\n### ALE regions and their corresponding parcellations \n  \nFigure\u00a0  demonstrates the ALE of the 35 fMRI experiments included in our meta\u2010analysis. Highlighted areas include the bilateral frontal opercula and insulae, bilateral segments of the middle portion of the cingulate gyrus, and bilateral segments of the central portion of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Nine ROIs were found to overlap in the fMRI data, including the anterior insula and frontal operculum areas anterior ventral insula (AVI), middle insula (MI), frontal operculum 4 (FOP4) and 5 (FOP5); middle cingulate areas anterior 24 prime (a24pr), anterior 32 prime (a32pr), posterior 32 prime (p32pr), and supplementary and cingulate eye field (SCEF); and dorsolateral prefrontal area 46. Comparison overlays between the cortical parcellations and the ALE data are shown in Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nActivation likelihood estimation (ALE) of 12 task\u2010based fMRI experiments related to goal\u2010oriented attentional processing.

Regions were visually assessed for inclusion in the network if they overlapped with the ALE data. Parcellations included in the model of salience were identified in the insula, including AVI, FOP4, FOP5, and MI (top row); the middle cingulate gyrus, including a24pr, a32pr, p32pr, and SCEF (bottom row); and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, including 46 (middle). The labels indicate the parcellation shown in each panel.

These clusters demonstrated two main types of structural connections via the frontal aslant tract (FAT) and local association fibers, which are discussed below. The complete network model is shown in Figure\u00a0 . Furthermore, Figure\u00a0  presents a simplified schematic of the ROIs and main structural connections included in the cortical model. Lines in this schematic represent individual connections of the SN and are labeled with their corresponding strength measured by averaging the number of tracts between ROI pairs across all subjects. Individual pairs with less than 10 connections were not included in our network model to only highlight the frequent connections that are clinically relevant. \n  \nFiber tracking analysis for the salience network (SN).

Abbreviations: a24pr, anterior 24 prime; a32pr, anterior 32 prime; AVI, areas anterior ventral insula; FOP4, frontal operculum 4; FOP5, frontal operculum 5; MI, middle insula; p32pr, posterior 32 prime; SCEF, supplementary and cingulate eye field \n    \nSimplified schematic of the white matter connections identified between individual parcellations of the SN during the fiber tracking analysis. Connections are labeled with the average strength measured across all 25 subjects. Abbreviations: a24pr, anterior 24 prime; a32pr, anterior 32 prime; AVI, areas anterior ventral insula; FOP4, frontal operculum 4; FOP5, frontal operculum 5; MI, middle insula; p32pr, posterior 32 prime; SCEF, supplementary and cingulate eye field \n  \nThe FAT formed nearly half of the connections (16/36, 44%) found between cortical areas within the SN. The FAT projects between the insular\u2010opercular cluster to the middle cingulate cluster as it courses within the white matter of the posterior frontal lobe (Figure\u00a0 ). Two parcellations within the insular\u2010opercular cluster contribute to the FAT, areas FOP4 and MI. The fibers arise from the insula and operculum and curve gradually in the cranio\u2010caudal plane before reaching the middle cingulate cortex. The fibers pass close to the wall of the lateral ventricle before terminating in regions p32pr and SCEF. \n\nShort local association fibers demonstrating a unique U\u2010shaped morphology (\u201cU\u2010fibers\u201d) were also identified and formed most of the connections between ROI pairs in our SN model. These U\u2010fibers generally have the same morphology, arising within one part of the cortex before curving 180 degrees to terminate in a part of the brain immediately adjacent to its origin. As such, these fibers represent the local connections between insular\u2010opercular and cingulate cortical areas nearby (discussed further in Section\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn this study, we constructed a detailed, cortical model of the neuroanatomic substrates involved in the SN. We identified three clusters of interconnected cortical regions that were extensively connected with both FAT fibers and short local association fibers, generally forming a large cingulate and insular\u2010opercular system. Specifically, the SN was found to have clusters of ROIs involved in anterior insular\u2010opercular, middle cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, which agrees well with previous work by others (Ghahremani et\u00a0al.,  ; Menon & Uddin,  ; Seeley,  ) and that of our own team (Baker, Burks, Briggs, Conner, Glenn, Morgan, et\u00a0al.,  ; Baker, Burks, Briggs, Conner, Glenn, Robbins, et\u00a0al.,  ; Baker, Burks, Briggs, Stafford, et\u00a0al.,  ). The white matter bundles found connecting the anterior insula and frontal operculum ROIs with the middle cingulate cortex were exclusively FAT fibers. Furthermore, our network model demonstrated strong interconnectedness within each individual cluster of ROIs via short\u2010local association fibers, which demonstrated a unique \u201cU\u2010shaped\u201d morphology. These U\u2010fibers were seen connecting possible SN nodes in the anterior insula and frontal operculum with each other as well as within nodes of the middle cingulate cortex. Together, this extensive connectivity likely supports the functional role of the SN in detecting and processing salient stimuli to guide biologically and cognitively relevant behavior as described in previous work (Menon & Uddin,  ; Seeley et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nImportantly, our results generally corroborate well with the findings of previous work despite utilizing grossly different methodology. However, the current work provides a more detailed cortical model of the ROIs and connections involved in the SN by utilizing combined structural and functional neuroimaging studies in the literature and by describing our results according to the detailed HCP parcellation scheme (Glasser et\u00a0al.,  ). Unfortunately, the structural interconnectedness of the SN has previously remained underspecified despite both its increasing body of research over previous years and the large advancements in neuroimaging technologies made in the neuroscience community (Doyen & Dadario,  ; Menon,  ). Such precision and clarity of the structural white matter connectivity of the SN are necessary to better understand the essential functions of the SN according to individual neural substrates and how to navigate this region with clinical applications (Menon,  ; Rosen et\u00a0al.,  ). To understand how each of these structural substrates of the SN may support its functional relevance, it is important to first understand the speculative functions of each cortical ROI included in our model and their relative locations according to the HCP parcellation scheme. \n\n### Cortical regions in the SN \n  \n#### T  he insular\u2010opercular cluster  \n  \nThe insula has been described consistently within the literature as a functionally heterogeneous region, with its most anterior aspect likely forming a key hub of the SN (Menon & Uddin,  ; Seeley et\u00a0al.,  ; Uddin,  ; White et\u00a0al.,  ). Relatedly, we identified cortical areas AVI and MI that overlapped with the ALE in the anterior insula. Several functions have been ascribed to the insula, including roles in sensation and control of autonomic nervous system processes as well as human awareness, self\u2010recognition, time perception, and perceptual decision making (Craig,  ; Nelson et\u00a0al.,  ). The anterior insula in particular receives a variety of multimodal inputs, such as both auditory and visual information, as well as from autonomic processes, positioning it in a key position to detect and integrate both biologically and behaviorally relevant stimuli (Menon,  ). Both areas AVI and MI in particular were only recently delineated as distinct parts of the cortex in 2016, and therefore, further information on their specific functional relevance remains scarce (Glasser et\u00a0al.,  ). Anatomically, area AVI is located at the anterosuperior apex of the insula, while MI is located within the posterosuperior aspect of the short insular gyri. \n\nOther cortical areas identified resided in the frontal opercular region according to our ALE, including areas FOP4 and FOP5. Both of these regions are located in the inferior frontal gyrus, where FOP4 is located on the inner surface of the pars opercularis, and FOP5 is located on the undersurface of the opercular part of the pars triangularis. Furthermore, they have both been described consistently within the literature as part of the SN (Elton & Gao,  ; Menon & Uddin,  ; Sadaghiani & D'Esposito,  ; Seeley et\u00a0al.,  ). Unfortunately, similar to AVI and MI, there is little known about areas FOP4 and FOP5, as they were described as distinct cortical areas in 2016 (Glasser et\u00a0al.,  ). However, the frontal operculum is known to play a role in the initiation of language and lexical retrieval required for language learning (Li et\u00a0al.,  ; Steinmetz & Seitz,  ). \n\n\n#### The middle cingulate cluster \n  \nThe cingulate gyrus has been divided by Brodmann into 6 regions, while the HCP has further divided it into 21 distinct regions between the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (Baker, Burks, Briggs, Stafford, et\u00a0al.,  ; Glasser et\u00a0al.,  ). The anterior portion, compared to the posterior cingulate cortex, is better understood to anchor the SN (Menon,  ; Menon & Uddin,  ). Given that the anterior cingulate cortex contains 13 distinct regions characterized by the HCP authors, the current study highlights the imperative need for more precise anatomic network models (Baker, Burks, Briggs, Stafford, et\u00a0al.,  ; Glasser et\u00a0al.,  ). We specifically identified the cortical areas a24pr, a32pr, p32pr, and SCEF, which mostly overlapped with the ALE in the middle cingulate cortex and have been consistently described within the literature as forming part of the SN (Ham et\u00a0al.,  ; Menon & Uddin,  ; Seeley et\u00a0al.,  ; White et\u00a0al.,  ). Distinct functions have been attributed to each of these individual areas, which we describe below along with their topographical location. \n\nArea a24pr is implicated in cognitive response selection and in word and sentence selection during language\u2010based tasks (Devinsky et\u00a0al.,  ). Specifically, area a24pr is located in the middle cingulate gyrus, occupying the superior half of the gyrus as it extends into the inferior bank of the cingulate sulcus. In contrast, area a32pr is known to help guide behavior by evaluating motivation, anticipating outcomes, recognizing reward values, and encoding errors to influence attention allocation and motor preparation (Bush et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). Area p32pr has been implicated as part of the \u201ccognitive division\u201d of the anterior cingulate cortex and is involved in stimulus and response selection in tasks that require attention for linguistic and sensory information (Devinsky et\u00a0al.,  ; Gasquoine,  ). Together, compared to area a24pr, areas a32pr and p32pr are located more superiorly in the posteroinferior portion of the superior frontal gyrus. Last, SCEF is a higher\u2010order oculomotor center implicated in appraising all possible oculomotor behaviors for goal\u2010directed behavior (Stuphorn,  ). SCEF can be seen in the posterior medial superior frontal gyrus. \n\nCommon functional themes related to the areas of the cingulate cluster include selection and appraisal of tasks (areas a24pr, a32pr, and p32pr), attention allocation (a32pr), and oculomotor control for goal\u2010directed behavior (SCEF; Baker, Burks, Briggs, Conner, Glenn, Robbins, et\u00a0al.,  ; Baker, Burks, Briggs, Stafford, et\u00a0al.,  ). These functional attributes support previous hypotheses of the SN's role in task selection as the brain switches between resting and active states of mind based on individual goals and the stimuli presented. \n\n\n#### The DLPFC cluster \n  \nThe DLPFC was segregated into 13 distinct ROIs. While many classically relate the DLPFC to the central executive network, it is a functionally heterogeneous region and an increasingly evolved cortical area. Nonetheless, it has been previously poorly understood in terms of connectivity. In this context, we identified one parcellation within the central portion of the DLPFC, area 46, to be included in our cortical model of the SN, which also supports previous work (Schaefer et\u00a0al.,  ). Unsurprisingly, area 46 has been demonstrated elsewhere with similar ALE analyses to participate in goal\u2010directed processes related to higher\u2010order cognition, such as to orient attention to and facilitating executive functions related to planning tasks (Nitschke et\u00a0al.,  ; Petrides,  ). In regard to its exact location, area 46 can be seen located along the superior frontal sulcus posteriorly, with its anterior portion located on parts of the middle frontal gyrus (Briggs, Lin, et\u00a0al.,  ). It is structurally connected to several other cortical parcellations outside of the SN network as well, such as to adjacent regions of the DLPFC participating in the central executive network (Baker, Burks, Briggs, Conner, Glenn, Morgan, et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nImportantly, this parcellation has been previously characterized by our team and many others to be likely the most successful cortical target for modulatory treatments to alleviate depressive symptoms. A recent study on veterans with treatment\u2010resistant major depression demonstrated that area 46 was the common target in successful treatment responders to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, compared to other slightly adjacent DLPFC targets that were significantly more common in nonresponders, such as area 8AV (Rosen et\u00a0al.,  ). These differences reflect that despite the close dspatial proximity of any two targets, they could modulate different networks, specifically area 46 with the SN and area 8AV with the DMN. Such clarification could improve the efficacy of large randomized controlled trials (RCT)\u00a0fm\u00a0that have failed to detect meaningful treatment improvements due to imprecise cortical targeting and subsequent network modulations, suggesting the need for more precise parcellation\u2010based network models as in this study (Moreno\u2010Ortega et\u00a0al.,  ; Yesavage et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\n\n\n### Structural connectivity of the SN \n  \nImproving our understanding of the precise connectivity of the SN can shed important insight into how specific neuroanatomic substrates in the SN facilitate the human ability to identify and process biologically and behaviorally relevant stimuli and how this information may differ between specific individuals. The strength and fiber type of individual connections identified between parcellations of the SN are reported in Table\u00a0  according to deterministic tractographic analyses and are discussed in brief below. \n  \nThe strength of the connections identified between parcellations of the salience network \n      \nFunction of each cortical region of interest included in our model and their relative locations according to the Human Connectome Project (HCP) parcellation scheme \n    \n#### The SN consists of FAT and U\u2010shaped association fibers \n  \nMany of the fiber bundles demonstrated in our network model were in the form of FAT fibers. Namely, ROIs in the fronto\u2010opercular cluster demonstrated connectivity via FAT fibers to ROIs in the middle cingulate cluster. Similar FAT connections have not been described in other cortical models of the SN, which have mostly implicated the uncinate fasciculus (Menon,  ). This absence likely reflects the relatively nascent identification of the FAT in 2008, only 1 year after the general characterization of the SN in humans (Catani et\u00a0al.,  ; Seeley et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nWhile our team has been consistently incorporating preoperative tractography of the FAT for many years to attempt to reduce cognitive morbidity (Briggs, Allan, et\u00a0al.,  ), such connections have been recently implicated in a variety of neurologic disorders that necessitates further study on these connections (Menon,  ; Uddin et\u00a0al.,  ). For instance, disconnecting the FAT is strongly associated with the classically described \u201cSMA syndrome,\u201d characterized by hemiparesis and mutism, and preservation of the FAT mostly prevents these deficits (Briggs, Allan, et\u00a0al.,  ). Through a number of multinetwork interactions with higher\u2010order networks and the motor system along the medial frontal lobe, it is possible that the FAT is the primary fiber that facilitates the role of the SN in appropriately transitioning internal goals and thoughts into executable actions, such as with speech or motor planning (Dadario et\u00a0al.,  ; Menon,  ; Poologaindran et\u00a0al.,  ). However, the current work cannot confirm this functional relevance, and our data support that possible connections exist that may facilitate these functions and require further clinical study. \n\nThe other fibers identified in the current study were short, local association fibers that took on a distinct \u201cU\u2010shaped\u201d morphology. U\u2010shaped segments were seen connecting each ROI within their respective clusters. U\u2010fibers are commonly identified across the human cerebrum, linking adjacent gyri. Compared to common diffusion tensor imaging\u2010based tractographic analyses used in previous studies, DSI\u2010based analyses with GQI\u2010based methodology, as employed in the current study, are better at resolving U\u2010shaped crossing fibers due to methodological differences in techniques (Qi et\u00a0al.,  ). As such, their speculative functions may be more easily identifiable compared to the FAT. Given the short nature of these U\u2010fibers with closely located cortical regions, they are generally described to facilitate quick information transfer between different regions within a network, usually in a single brain lobe (Briggs, Tanglay, et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Strength of connections within the SN \n  \nIt is certainly the case that the structural connectivity of the SN varies to some degree between individuals, and by presenting both sets of average connection strengths, one can see how these connections can vary in the network (Table\u00a0 ). For example, the connection from area a32pr to FOP5 has an average strength of 34.72 across all 25 subjects (meaning one would expect to find 34.72 streamlines using the fiber tracking algorithm discussed in the methods) versus an average strength of 144.67 in the six individuals in which the connection was identified. By reporting both numbers, we can see that while the connection between a32pr and FOP5 is relatively infrequent in the network (6/25, 24%), in the specific individuals who have such a connection, it is relatively strong. Comparatively, connections between a32pr\u2010SCEF were present in 23/25 subjects (92%) and therefore likely include a more common structural connection that can be identified in most SNs analyzed. \n\nIt should also be noted that we did not set a threshold for the strength that might limit the connections shown for the SN. For example, assessing the connection between MI and p32pr via the FAT, one sees that the average strength across all 25 subjects used in this study was 3.76 versus 23.5 in the four subjects for whom such a connection was identified. If we had set a threshold of an average strength of 10.0 or set a threshold related to the frequency by which we saw the connection, that is, in at least 20/25 subjects, then we would not report this connection at all. However, such a strict definition may incorrectly overlook important interindividual differences, which could provide insight into unique pathophysiological states or for clinical translation. Instead, it is more appropriate to say that the connection between MI and p32pr, while relatively weak compared to other connections in the network, still occurs infrequently in the SN, as opposed to reporting that no such connection exists between these two areas. Despite not setting a threshold, the frequency and strength associated with similar weak connections compared to what is seen between MI and SCEF raise the serious question of whether this connection is critical for the functionality of the network. Nonetheless, answering questions about what connections are more functionally \u201celoquent\u201d is beyond the scope of this study and requires further information in a clinical setting. \n\n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nWhile we attempted to construct a cortical model of the neuroanatomic substrates involved in the SN with high precision by utilizing novel meta\u2010analytic and precise connectivity\u2010based analyses, the current study is not without its limitations. Similar to all meta\u2010analyses, findings from the current study are limited by the quality of the reported literature and may be influenced by possible publication bias. Fortunately, coordinate\u2010based ALE analyses employ strict cluster\u2010level interference algorithms that attempt to only identify statistically likely ROIs that coactivate together based on certain search parameters incorporated (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Turkeltaub et\u00a0al.,  ); however, the absence of studies in the literature that report negative results precludes the inclusion and effective investigation of more regions in our analyses. A recently suggested method that may improve this limitation in the future is to include additional code that creates fictious \u201cnoise studies\u201d to control for possible unreported results (Acar et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nAn additional benefit of utilizing coordinate\u2010based, meta\u2010analytic methodology is the ability to overcome the limitations of heterogenous topographical nomenclature often utilized in the literature for homologous brain structures. By including reported stereotactic coordinates from previous studies, more anatomically precise results can be obtained. In this context, we have been attempting to characterize all of our current findings within the HCP nomenclature given its more precise parcellation scheme (Kuiper et\u00a0al.,  ; Milton et\u00a0al.,  ; Sandhu et\u00a0al.,  ; Sheets, Briggs, Dadario, et\u00a0al.,  ). For instance, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula are known to be functionally divided within numerous subdivisions (Glasser et\u00a0al.,  ), yet previous studies on the SN network continue to generally reference these regions as just general nodes in the SN. Such vague characterizations can disbar adequate hypothesis comparison between studies, limit reproducibility, and fail to provide anatomically precise information at a level of granularity that can now be utilized for clinical treatments (McCoy et\u00a0al.,  ; Poologaindran et\u00a0al.,  \n). By acquiring and analyzing coordinates and then applying the subsequent results in the precise HCP parcellation scheme, our results of specific cortical regions and their unique connectivity in the SN can provide a preliminary model for further study on how this brain organization supports human functioning and to guide clinical decision making in associated cortices. \n\nWith improved information on the human connectome, the neuroscientific community has acquired improved opportunities to individualize treatment in the context of a number of pathophysiologic states. However, combined structural\u2010functional studies inherently face certain limitations due to commonly described concerns of tractography analyses. Surely, it is understood that ALE results provide more rigorous quantitative results than what current diffusion studies are capable of doing (Eickhoff et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Schilling et\u00a0al.,  ). For instance, as mentioned in Table\u00a0 , one could see a certain degree of individual variability within specific white matter connections by comparing the average amount of tracts in all subjects versus only subjects in which the tracts were identified. Furthermore, while this methodology has been applied by our team over numerous other cortical regions, we have found that our results are relatively robust to the number of participants usually included (i.e., averages of 80 subjects are likely similar to those of 10 subjects), and there is always some degree of individual variability with tractographic analyses (Briggs, Tanglay, et\u00a0al.,  ; Palejwala et\u00a0al.,  ; Sheets, Briggs, Dadario, et\u00a0al.,  ). These differences are largely due to the inherent uniqueness of neural structures between individuals. Such observations should not influence one to disregard tractographic analyses but rather consider their primary importance in   qualitatively   demonstrating the nature of the more common,   major   white matter connectivity between ROIs. In particular, gathering a more complete understanding of the major structural connectivity of a region holds unique applications within the neurosurgical community when operating in this region (Briggs, Allan, et\u00a0al.,  ; Burks et\u00a0al.,  ; Dadario et\u00a0al.,  ; Zhiqiang et\u00a0al.,  ). Furthermore, variability in these structural results provides a basis for future studies to more rigorously investigate how interindividual differences in brain structural\u2010functional relationships related to the SN may underlie unique physiological and pathophysiological states (Barron et\u00a0al.,  ). While future improvements in these analyses are surely exhilarating, it is important to interpret the results of the current study within the context of its limitations. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nWe present a preliminary cortical model of the neuroanatomic substrates involved in the SN. The SN comprises parcellations within the anterior insula and frontal operculum cortices that are connected with the middle cingulate cortex via the FAT. Numerous short, U\u2010shaped fibers were also found linking adjacent clusters of SN nodes located in the middle cingulate cortex and anterior insula. Our parcellation\u2010based connectivity model of the SN provides anatomically precise data that serve as an empirical foundation to be refined in future studies. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nMichael Sughrue is the chief medical officer, co\u2010founder, and shareholder of Omniscient Neurotechnology.
