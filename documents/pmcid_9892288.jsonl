Studies using\ntask-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to probe neural\ndysfunction in irritability have increased. However, an integrated review\nsummarizing the published methods and synthesized fMRI results remains\nlacking. \n\n\n## Method: \n  \nWe conducted a systematic search using irritability terms and task\nfunctional neuroimaging in key databases in March 2021, and identified 30\nstudies for our systematic review. Sample characteristics and fMRI methods\nwere summarized. A subset of 28 studies met the criteria for extracting\ncoordinate-based data for quantitative meta-analysis. Ten\nactivation-likelihood estimations were performed to examine neural\nconvergence across irritability measures and fMRI task domains. \n\n\n## Results: \n  \nSystematic review revealed small sample sizes (median = 58, mean age\nrange = 8\u201316 years) with heterogeneous sample characteristics,\nirritability measures, tasks, and analytical procedures. Meta-analyses found\nno evidence for neural activation convergence of irritability across\nneurocognitive functions related to emotional reactivity, cognitive control,\nand reward processing, or within each domain. Sensitivity analyses\npartialing out variances driven by heterogeneous tasks, irritability\nmeasures, stimulus types, and developmental ages all yielded null findings.\nResults were compared with a review on irritability-related structural\nanomalies from 11 studies. \n\n\n## Conclusion: \n  \nThe lack of neural convergence suggests a need for common,\nstandardized irritability assessments and more homogeneous fMRI tasks.\nThoughtfully designed fMRI studies probing commonly defined neurocognitive\nfunctions may be more fruitful to elucidate the neural mechanisms of\nirritability. Open science practices, data mining in large neuroscience\ndatabases, and standardized analytical methods promote meaningful\ncollaboration in irritability research. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nChildhood irritability (hereafter, irritability), an elevated proneness to anger\nrelative to peers,  has received increased attention in child\npsychiatry in the last decade. Irritability is characterized by frequent,\ndevelopmentally inappropriate temper outbursts, low frustration tolerance, and/or\nirritable and negative mood.  With an estimated community prevalence of 0.12%\nto 5%,  epidemiological studies have\nshown that the negative mental health and life outcomes of irritability extend into\nadulthood,  predicting risks of\nmajor affective symptoms and disorders (eg, anxious and depressed symptoms)  and suicidal ideation/attempts.  Although irritability is a hallmark feature of disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder (DMDD), it is a transdiagnostic symptom commonly co-occurring\nwith major psychiatric conditions in youths, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, and autism spectrum\ndisorder (ASD). This highlights the need to study the neural mechanisms of irritability,\nwhich may have treatment implications for many pediatric disorders in which irritability\noccurs. \n\nOver the past decade, many attempts have been made at progress probing the\nneural mechanisms of irritability using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\nMost of these fMRI studies investigated the brain\u2013behavior association between\nirritability symptoms and task-related blood-oxygenation\u2013dependent\nsignals.  The\ncurrent integrated review focused on 3 neurocognitive domains in irritability, namely\nemotional reactivity, reward processing, and cognitive control. Brotman   et\nal.   proposed a\ntranslational neuroscience model of irritability that outlined 2 neural and/or\nbehavioral pathways of irritability\u2014threat processing and reward processing.\nEvidence for the threat processing pathway showed that when presented with potentially\nthreatening emotional stimuli (eg, angry and fearful facial expressions), youths with\nhigh irritability symptoms and those diagnosed with marked irritability (eg, DMDD)\nshowed aberrant reactivity in subcortical regions, such as the amygdala, insula, and\nthalamus, relative to typically developing peers.  These aberrant\nneural responses are thought to reflect heightened threat responding in youths with high\nirritability.  Here, the term \u201cemotion\nreactivity\u201d was used, given that task fMRI studies in the field commonly compare\nneural responses to threat or negatively valenced stimuli vs positive and/or neutral\nstimuli. \n\nMost evidence for the reward processing pathway was grounded in frustrative\nnonreward, a negative valence construct in the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)  matrix. When the omission of expected\nreward elicits frustration, youths with high irritability showed aberrant neural\nresponses in fronto-striatal regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyri, and\ncaudate, compared to typically developing youths.  Other studies also\ntested reward processing without the use of a rigged reward schedule to evoke\nfrustration, and reported less consistent results in the frontal  and temporal  gyri. Together, aberrant fronto-striatal responses, notably\nthose elicited by frustrative nonreward, are conceptualized as deficits in\nreward-related processing underlying irritability. \n\nA smaller body of task fMRI studies investigated cognitive\ncontrol\u2013related functions, probing the top-down regulation and coordination of\ncognitive processes. These studies have found that youths with high irritability\nsymptoms showed inhibitory deficits, and that irritability symptom severity was\nassociated with aberrant activation in the superior frontal and temporal gyri, inferior\nfrontal gyri, and anterior cingulate cortices during inhibitory control tasks.  According to the exposure-targeted model of irritability,  cognitive control functions facilitate\ntop-down regulation of frustration and outburst behaviors, which are promising targets\nfor intervention. \n\nAlthough these results are promising, there are overlapping as well as distinct\nregions across these individual fMRI studies targeting different neurocognitive domains.\nIt remains largely unknown whether there are convergent neural responses in specific\nregions that reflect shared neural mechanisms of irritability across threat-responding,\nfrustrative nonreward processing and cognitive control. Also, many past studies had\nsmall sample sizes, and variations in research designs (eg, diagnostic groups,\nirritability measures, dimensional vs categorical conceptualization of irritability,\nexperimental paradigms) may limit the generalizability of results and contribute to\nheterogeneous findings across individual studies. Therefore, we conducted a systematic\nreview and meta-analysis to synthesize the irritability fMRI studies published to date,\nto consolidate the current state of knowledge and to identify neural correlates of\nirritability that are robust to variations in task validity and study designs. \n\nMethodological issues aside, age and sex differences are relatively neglected in\nthe irritability fMRI literature. There is increasing advocacy for attending to\ndevelopmental differences in pediatric neuroimaging, as developmental stage may moderate\nsocio-affective brain functions. \nFronto-striatal dysfunction following frustrative nonreward was found to be more\npronounced in youths with irritability in mid-childhood and early adolescence, compared\nto late adolescence.  However, it\nremains largely unclear whether the neural correlates of irritability differ as youths\ntransition from one developmental stage to another (eg, from late childhood to early\nadolescence when prefrontal circuitries important for mood regulation develop\nmarkedly).  Similarly,\nalthough research attending to sex differences in irritability symptoms and\nclassification is emerging, \nirritability studies investigating sex differences in task-dependent neural responses\nare scarce. \n\nThe current integrated review has 3 major aims. First, we present a systematic\nreview of task fMRI studies focusing on neural activation associated with irritability\nand related constructs (eg, reactive aggression, anger) in children and adolescents aged\n6 to 18 years, the most common age range sampled in the literature of fMRI research in\nirritability. By summarizing the sample characteristics and methodological aspects of\nthe studies, we provide an overview of the task fMRI study designs. We also summarize\nthe past studies on age and sex differences in the neural correlates of irritability.\nSecond, we conduct a quantitative meta-analysis based on a subset of qualified task fMRI\nstudies to identify the most robust neural correlates of irritability across\nneurocognitive domains, that is, those with high convergence across all individual\nstudies. To provide a more nuanced understanding of the neural mechanisms of\nirritability, we also examine the extent to which these neural correlates converge\nspecifically within each of the neurocognitive domains examined, namely, emotion\nreactivity, reward processing, and cognitive control. Third, we conduct sensitivity\nanalyses to identify potential sources of nonconvergence by systematically removing\nvariances due to study heterogeneity (eg, irritability measurements, dimensional vs\ncategorical conceptualization of irritability, age differences). We discuss the\nsynthesized results in the context of existing neuroscience-informed models of\nirritability,  and provide recommendations for future\nneuroimaging studies on irritability. \n\n## METHOD \n  \n### Identification of Task fMRI Studies \n  \nA systematic search was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items\nfor Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines  to identify potential task fMRI studies\nfor the purpose of this review and meta-analysis. Importantly, we conceptualized\nirritability using a transdiagnostic approach, imposing no restrictions on the\ndiagnostic categories of the samples recruited and irritability measures used in\nthe task fMRI studies. Yet, to capture the irritability phenotype as\nconceptualized, we focused on constructs with marked or highly associated\nfeatures of irritability, which included anger, reactive aggression, and mood\ndysregulation.  Such conceptualization hence gave rise to the following\nsearch terms and their derivatives: (((irritability) OR (anger) OR (reactive\naggression) OR (dysregulation)) AND ((child*) OR (adolescent*)) AND ((fMRI) OR\n(functional magnetic resonance imaging))), which were used to search for\npeer-reviewed task-fMRI journal articles published in English, from January 2000\nto March 2021. The systematic search was run in PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline, and\nWeb of Science. To ensure that the search included all the key fMRI studies of\ninterest, the identified list of articles was cross-checked with a recent\nnarrative review on the neural dysfunctions of irritability.  Details of the screening procedures and\ninformation regarding the exclusion of articles were outlined in the PRISMA flow\nchart ( ). After independent screening, in-depth reading of full\narticles, and consensus meetings with senior authors, a final collection of 30\narticles were included in the systematic review ( ), 28 of which included\nwhole-brain analyses and thus qualified for the quantitative meta-analysis. The\nidentified studies were published between 2009 and 2021, 20 of which were\npublished after 2015. Upon independent data extraction, 3 of the 28 studies were\nfurther excluded from the main quantitative meta-analysis because significant\nclusters were found in the ROI analysis only,  no significant clusters were reported\nfor any task interaction effects with irritability independent of age,  and only significant main\neffects of irritability were found.  This resulted in a final collection of 25 task fMRI\nstudies for the main coordinate-based meta-analysis. A detailed summary of the\nrelevant findings and coordinates extracted from the task fMRI studies can be\nfound in  \nand  , available\nonline. Coordinates were converted to and reported in the Montreal Neurological\nInstitute space using the Yale BioImage Suite. The current review and\nmeta-analysis was registered with the PROSPERO ID: CRD42021253757. \n\n\n### Systematic Review \n  \nTo provide an overview of the task fMRI studies, we first summarized the\nsample characteristics and key fMRI methodologies reported in the studies. For\nsample characteristics, we extracted the full and subsample sizes, diagnosis,\npercentage of male participants, recruitment site, average age and age range,\nand irritability measure used. For fMRI methodologies, we coded whether the\nstudies conducted whole-brain or region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, specific\nregions of interest (if applicable), fMRI tasks and their neurocognitive domains\nprobed (emotion reactivity, cognitive control, reward processing), and\nstatistical thresholds for conducting those analyses. For emotion reactivity, we\ncategorized studies that used experimental paradigms that involve the perception\nof and/or engagement with emotional stimuli. Examples are fMRI tasks that invite\nparticipants to view emotional facial expressions or to perform a computer game\ndesigned to elicit anger and frustration. For cognitive control, we grouped\nstudies with paradigms that demand top-down executive functions, such as tasks\nrequiring participants to inhibit one\u2019s behavior and orient one\u2019s\nattention with respect to task demands. For reward processing, we identified\nfMRI tasks that require participants to engage in reward-driven behaviors, often\nimplemented in a game-like setting along with a reward scheme. We acknowledged\nthat these neurocognitive domains are not completely independent of each other,\nand it is common that some fMRI tasks might be classified into more than one\nneurocognitive domain, such as the Affective Posner Task.  Nonetheless, organizing studies by neurocognitive domains\nallowed for imposing a systematic framework and increasing study availability\nfor the subgroup quantitative meta-analyses, which are insightful for guiding\nfuture research. Moreover, we coded whether sex differences were examined. It\nshould be noted that 2 of the 30 studies included in the systematic review did\nnot qualify for subsequent data extraction for the quantitative meta-analysis\nbecause whole-brain analyses were not conducted.  Still, a qualitative summary of the sample characteristics\nand fMRI methodologies of these studies was deemed informative for future\nrecruitment and study design. \n\n\n### Quantitative Meta-Analysis \n  \nRandom effects activation likelihood estimation (ALE) was conducted in\nGingerALE version 3.0.2. \nPeak coordinates of the relevant contrasts were extracted from the task fMRI\nstudies and entered to the software, deriving activation likelihood estimates\nfor each voxel. Analyses were conducted where there were adequate numbers of\nexperiments (k = 17) as recommended by Eickhoff   et\nal.  \nHowever, ad justments were made to allow for subgroup analyses of the various\nneurocognitive dimensions due to study availability.  For these subgroup analyses, a minimum\nof 8 to 10 studies were required to produce valid results while balancing the\nneed for synthesized fMRI findings with statistical rigor. \n\nFor our main analysis, a within-group analysis was first conducted using\nall available task fMRI studies (k = 25, 167 foci). Following published\nguidelines and previous meta-analyses,  statistical significance of the\n  p  -value maps was set at a cluster-level inference corrected\nthreshold of   p   < .05, with 1,000 thresholding\npermutations and an uncorrected   p   < .001. Because\nincluding all available contrasts from the identified studies would introduce\nwithin-group effects from those that reported alternative analyses of similar\ncontrasts, which could affect the Modeled Activation (MA) values in the software\nalgorithm,  we carefully selected the more\ninterpretable and relevant contrast(s) with respect to the study\u2019s key\nresearch interest (eg, angry vs neutral faces for facial emotion processing\nstudies ; reward vs\nnonreward conditions during reward anticipation, and performance feedback\nconditions wherever possible for reward-processing studies).  For studies that reported more than one\nrelevant contrast with the same control condition (eg, negative faces vs shapes\nand positive faces vs shapes ), the respective coordinates were pooled as one experiment as\nrecommended.  Given that more studies reported significant\ntask-related neural responses when analyzing parent-reported (k = 4) than\nchild-reported (k = 1) irritability symptoms alone, we prioritized contrasts\nbased on parent report to reduce informant-related variances across individual\nstudies. To gain deeper insight into the functional significance of the neural\naberrations associated with irritability, 3 subgroup analyses were conducted\nseparately for each neurocognitive domain defined previously. These included\nemotion reactivity (k = 19, 138 foci), cognitive control (k = 9, 73 foci), and\nreward processing (k = 7, 52 foci). \n\nSeven sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, to supplement the main\nanalysis, we increased the study pool by adding the study by Chaarani   et\nal.  ,  who\nconducted a whole-brain structural analysis but only found significant clusters\nassociated with irritability symptoms in the follow-up functional ROI analysis\n(resulting in a total k = 26, 170 foci). Second, we conducted an analysis\nrestricting to only emotional reactivity studies that used facial emotional\nprocessing tasks or involved facial emotion stimuli (k = 12, 92 foci), given the\nrelatively large number of such tasks, to reduce task heterogeneity in the\nemotional reactivity domain. Third, 2 measurement sensitivity analyses were\nperformed, restricting analyses to studies assessing irritability using the\nAffective Reactivity Index (ARI)  (k = 10, 90 foci) and diagnostic modules focused on\nirritability (ie, severe mood dysregulation [SMD] and DMDD modules) from the\nKiddie Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia (K-SADS)  (k = 8, 59 foci), respectively. These measurement\nanalyses would provide important insights into the potential divergence of\nneural correlates regarding a dimensional vs categorical conceptualization of\nirritability. Relatedly, a phenotype sensitivity analysis was performed by\ncombining the ARI studies with the K-SADS studies (k = 17, 137 foci). A\ndevelopmental sensitivity analysis was conducted in studies with a mean sample\nage of less than 15 years (k = 22, 167 foci). We increased the study pool of\nthis sensitivity analysis by adding the work of Karim   et\nal.  ,  who\nfound significant clusters for an irritability by age interaction in a\nmid-childhood sample (mean age = 7.6 years). Study availability precluded us\nfrom conducting an ALE-based subtraction analysis with studies that sampled mid-\nto late-adolescents (k = 4). Finally, to evaluate the impact of sample size, we\nran a sensitivity analysis that included only studies with sample sizes greater\nthan the overall median sample size (N > 58; k = 12, 90 foci). Of note,\nalthough these sensitivity analyses helped to reduce heterogeneity, some of\nthese analyses and the subgroup analyses for cognitive control and reward\nprocessing had small numbers of studies and might not capture subtle effects\nbecause of limited power. These results should be interpreted with caution. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Systematic Review \n  \n#### Sample Characteristics. \n    \nSample size and age. Across all studies included in the\nsystematic review (k = 30), the average sample size was 87\nparticipants (median = 58, SD = 66.89, range = 19\u2013320). The\nnumber was comparable (mean = 82, median = 55, SD = 68.51, range =\n19\u2013320) when selecting the most relevant clinical groups with\nmarked irritability symptoms (eg, DMDD and SMD) for studies that\nfocused on diagnostic group comparisons without dimensional\nmeasures. In terms of age, 26 studies recruited pre- and\nmid-adolescents with mean ages below 15 years (mean = 13.12, median\n= 13.8, SD = 1.89, range = 7.6\u201314.9), whereas only 4 studies\nrecruited late-adolescents aged >15 years (mean = 15.45,\nmedian = 15.5, SD = 0.3, range = 15.1\u201315.7). \n  \nSex proportion. The average proportion of male participants\nwas 61.1% (median = 54.9%, SD = 18.62), ranging from 33.9% to 100%\n(4 studies had male participants only). \n  \nRecruitment. Most study samples were recruited from research\nfacilities with clinical services, such as the National Institute of\nMental Health (NIMH) (k = 14), Yale Child Study Center (k = 2), and\nlocal psychiatric units (k = 5). Four studies sampled youths who\nwere seeking treatment and at risk for developing significant\nirritability symptoms in the local community. \nTwo studies assessed irritability symptoms more broadly in healthy\ncommunity samples. \nThree studies constituted part of a large-scale research project\n(EU-Aggressotype and EU-MATRICS project,  Bipolar Offspring\nStudy, \nand IMAGEN ).\nBased on this summary, it is plausible that several studies might\nhave recruited their samples from the same source (eg, NIMH) and\nthat there might be overlapping subjects across these studies. \n  \nSocioeconomic status and race/ethnicity. Only 7 studies\nprovided socioeconomic information of the sample, most of whom were\nfrom mid- to high-income households and with parents attaining high\nschool or degree-level education. Eight studies reported\nrace/ethnicity; 6 of those studies recruited primarily White\nparticipants (mean = 64.6%, median = 62.8%, SD = 13.55, range = 50%\nto 80.4%), whereas 2 studies recruited predominantly\nHispanic/Latinx  and Black  participants. \n  \nDiagnosis. The samples included multiple clinical/research\ndiagnoses: ADHD (n = 207, k = 8), DMDD (n = 199, k = 5), BD (n =\n183, k = 7), SMD (n = 165, k = 8), anxiety (n = 152, k = 4), and ASD\n(n = 116, k = 3), and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and/or\nconduct disorder (CD; n = 108, k = 1). \n  \nIrritability measures. Three categories of irritability\nmeasures were observed. Ten studies assessed diagnostic categories\nwith marked irritability symptoms using the K-SADS in their main\nanalyses.  For dimensional\napproaches, 10 studies assessed irritability symptoms using the\nARI, \nwhereas 10 other studies used other dimensional measures assessing\nclinical features associated with irritability symptoms, such as the\nChild Behavior Checklist (CBCL), \nReactive\u2013Proactive Aggression Questionnaire,  and Child/Adolescent Symptom\nInventory. \n  \n\n\n### fMRI Methods \n    \nfMRI tasks. A wide array of experimental tasks were used to\nprobe neural dysfunction pertinent to irritability. Of the 30 studies,\n22 studies focused on emotional reactivity, 14 of which involved the\nperception of and/or engagement with emotional facial stimuli.  Seven studies probing reward\nprocessing included mostly the Monetary Incentive Delay Task,  the Affective Posner Task,  and other point-based tasks.  Eleven studies probing cognitive\ncontrol encompassed various subdomains of cognitive control functions in\nirritability, such as inhibitory control on the Stop Signal\nTask  and Flanker\nTask, \nreversal learning, \nand attention control processes.  Some studies involving emotional\nreactivity  and reward\nprocessing \nalso probed attention processes (eg, attention orienting). \n  \nfMRI analytical thresholds. Heterogeneous analytical thresholds\nwere observed across studies. Most analytical thresholds used in the\nwhole-brain analyses were voxelwise corrected (k = 18). Other correction\nmethods included those based on familywise error rate (k = 5) and false\ndiscovery rate (k = 1). Four studies reported uncorrected alpha levels.\nFor ROI analyses, similar to whole-brain, most thresholds were not\nclearly stated (k = 10). Other correction methods for ROI included those\nbased on cluster-extent (k = 2), Bonferroni correction (k = 2),\nfamilywise error rate (k = 1), false discovery rate (k = 1), and\nvoxelwise correction (k = 1). \n  \nSex differences. Of the 30 studies, only 5 studies examined sex\ndifferences in the task-dependent neural correlates of irritability;\nalmost all yielded no significant findings ( , available\nonline), except for 2 studies that reported a main effect of sex in the\nleft amygdala  and\nincreased activation in several regions important for salience detection\nduring frustrative nonreward processing in younger boys (eg, insula and\npre-/post-central gyri).  Seventeen studies did not report analyzing sex as a\ncovariate or sex by irritability interaction in their analyses. The 8\nstudies that analyzed sex as a covariate yielded mostly null findings;\nonly one study found sex differences in the salience network during\ninhibitory control, such as the thalamus and cingulate. \n  \n\n### Meta-Analysis: No Evidence for Convergent Neural Correlates of\nIrritability \n  \n#### Main and Subgroup Analyses. \n  \nThe main analysis inclusive of 25 task fMRI studies of irritability\n(167 foci) across all neurocognitive domains revealed no clusters of\nconvergence.   visualizes the\nunthresholded positive   z  -score map. The 3 subsequent\nsubgroup analyses focusing on 19 fMRI tasks (138 foci) probing emotional\nreactivity, 9 fMRI tasks (73 foci) probing cognitive control, and 7 fMRI\ntasks (52 foci) probing reward processing, respectively, all revealed no\nevidence for convergence within domain, suggesting that the null finding in\nthe main analysis was not driven by heterogeneity in tasks across\nneurocognitive domains. \n\n\n#### Sensitivity Analyses. \n  \nAs outlined earlier, 7 sensitivity analyses were conducted. Given\nthe null findings above, sensitivity analyses may help identify potential\nsources of nonconvergence by systematically removing variances contributed\nby study heterogeneity. In the first sensitivity analysis adding ROI\ncoordinates from the work by Chaarani   et al.   to increase the study pool\n(k = 26, 170 foci) and hence power, no convergent clusters were found.\nSecond, restricting the analysis to the emotional face tasks only (k = 12,\n92 foci) revealed no clusters of convergence. Third, the measurement\nsensitivity analyses also found no evidence for convergence within the 10\nstudies (90 foci) that dimensionally indexed irritability with the ARI, and\nwithin the 8 studies (59 foci) that analyzed diagnostic categories with\nmarked irritability on the K-SADS. The phenotype sensitivity analysis (k =\n17, 137 foci) aggregating the ARI studies and the K-SADS studies (which\ncharacterized marked irritability using the SMD and DMDD modules) yielded\nnull results. The developmental sensitivity analysis on 22 studies (167\nfoci) with a mean age of <15 years produced no convergent findings.\nFinally, the sensitivity analysis on 12 studies (90 foci) with at least a\nmedian sample size of 58 participants also yielded null results. \n\n\n#### Descriptive ROI Findings. \n  \nOf the 25 studies qualified for the meta-analysis, 15 studies also\nconducted ROI analyses investigating the association of irritability symptom\nseverity with and/or irritability group differences in task-dependent neural\nresponses in   a priori   defined brain regions. The\nhypothesized regions comprised regions in the salience network underlying\nthe threat-processing pathway (eg, amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate\ncortex) and fronto-striatal regions (eg, inferior frontal gyrus, caudate,\nnucleus accumbens, and putamen) underlying the reward-processing pathway in\nirritability.  Six\nof the 15 studies (7 foci) reported significant irritability-related ROI\nfindings. Notably, 2 of 3 studies found youths with high irritability\nshowing increased activation during reward processing  and decreased activation during a reversal learning\ntask  in the\ncaudate; 2 of 3 studies found increased putamen activation in youths with\nhigh irritability during reward processing tasks.  Despite the postulated role of the amygdala in\nmediating aberrant threat responding in irritability, only 2 of 12 studies\nfound increased amygdala responses in youths with high irritability during\nemotional face tasks.  presents a summary of the ROI\nfindings. \n\n\n\n### Relevant Structural MRI Literature \n  \nGiven that the main meta-analyses showed no convergent results among the\nfMRI studies, a comparison with the structural MRI literature may be helpful to\nclarify whether the null results were partly related to poor fMRI task validity.\nWe conducted a systematic review in the structural MRI literature using the same\nirritability search terms and identified 11 studies ( , available online).\nSample characteristics and key findings were summarized ( , available online). Of the\n11 studies, 8 studies examined gray and white matter volumes, 5 of which found\nreduced volumes in widely distributed frontal regions, including the inferior\nfrontal gyrus and prefrontal regions, whereas 3 studies reported reduced insular\nvolume. Findings on cortical thickness and surface area were inconclusive. This\nstructural review was not preregistered. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first integrated and meta-analytic synthesis\nof task fMRI findings in youths with irritability. We followed the latest\nrecommendations on coordinate-based fMRI meta-analysis, \nand found no evidence for convergence in the irritability fMRI literature either in\nthe main analysis across neurocognitive task domains or in the subgroup analyses for\nemotion reactivity, reward processing, and cognitive control. Further sensitivity\nanalyses restricting studies by stimulus type, dimensional and categorical\nirritability measures, irritability phenotype, and developmental ages also revealed\nno significant convergence across studies. The absence of neural convergence might\nstem from marked heterogeneity in clinical characteristics, small samples, and\nvariations in fMRI task design, irritability measurements, and statistical\nprocedures, such as thresholding, across individual studies. Moreover, a descriptive\nsummary of ROI results suggested altered neural responses during reward tasks in the\ncaudate and putamen associated with high irritability, consistent with the striatal\nreward processing pathway of irritability. \n\n### Heterogeneous Irritability Samples \n  \nAlthough the mean sample size (N = 87) seemed moderate for neuroimaging\nresearch, we noticed considerable variability in the sample sizes; indeed, the\nmedian sample size (N = 58) was small across studies. Small sample size not only\nreduces the power to detect subtle effects, which are common for tasks probing\nsocio-affective processing, \nbut also may result in inflated estimates, hampering the generalizability of the\nneuroimaging findings. All of these could contribute to the lack of convergence\nin the past fMRI studies in irritability. \n\nMyriad clinical conditions, including DMDD/SMD, ADHD, ASD, ODD, anxiety,\nand BD, were included in the reviewed studies, which highlights the\ntransdiagnostic feature of irritability. This raises the critical question as to\nwhat extent irritability is mediated by similar neural mechanisms across\ndiagnostic categories. We attempted to address this by restricting irritability\nphenotypes in our sensitivity analysis, yet yielded nonconvergence. Still, as in\nmany other phenotypes in psychiatry, heterogeneity in irritability is a clinical\nreality and a challenging issue in fMRI research. Heterogeneous clinical\nfeatures and developmental differences in the irritability phenotype might\ninteract with neurobiological alterations. Even within youths with irritability\nbut without comorbid conditions, there are variances in irritability symptom\npresentation, which may have different etiological pathways and may be mediated\nby different brain alterations. For instance, research has started to show that\nirritable mood (tonic irritability) and temper outbursts (phasic irritability)\nrelate to different genetic and environmental influences in DMDD,  as well as psychiatric risks\n(eg, ADHD,  depressive\ndisorders, and anxiety disorders ). These intricate dimensions are not well captured in the\ncurrent irritability measures. Novel methods and measurements indexing these\nsymptom dimensions in a more fine-grained manner needs to be developed (eg,\necological momentary assessment) and tested for their psychometric properties,\nwhich will facilitate future studies parsing the neurobiological underpinnings\nof different aspects of irritability (eg, tonic vs phasic irritability). \n\nMoreover, youths with clinical diagnoses are likely to receive\npsychotropic medications or psychotherapy and/or to have environmental risk\nfactors, such as socioeconomic disadvantages and adverse childhood\nexperiences,  which\nhave been shown to alter socio-affective brain functions mediating affective\nsymptoms and regulation. \nHowever, comprehensive reporting of sample socioeconomic status and\nrace/ethnicity information is rare in the field (ie, <30% of the studies\nreviewed here). Among the studies that reported this sociodemographic\ninformation, the majority included predominantly White participants from mid- to\nhigh-income households with parents attaining high school or degree-level\neducation, whereas only 2 studies recruited predominantly\nHispanic/Latinx  and\nBlack  participants,\nand only one study included youths with trauma histories.  Thus, the generalizability of the past\nfindings to diverse, representative populations is unclear. Future studies\nshould include more diverse samples, report sociodemographic composition of the\nstudy samples, and evaluate and discuss how the sociodemographic sample\ncharacteristics affect their findings. Importantly, more research is needed to\nexamine the impact of early life adversity and trauma on the etiology and\ndevelopment of childhood irritability, as youths from marginalized and adverse\nbackgrounds represent one of the most vulnerable groups to develop irritability\nsymptoms and deserve timely intervention. \n\nStudies differ in irritability measures. The most commonly used\ndimensional measures is the ARI,  whereas the most widely adopted categorical measure is\nirritability-related modules (ie, DMDD, ODD, SMD) on the K-SADS. Some other\nmeasures included selected items on the CBCL  and Reactive Proactive\nQuestionnaire.  Although dimensional measures\nare more sensitive in capturing individual differences in irritability symptoms\nand are well suited for sensitivity analyses partialing out comorbidity-related\nvariances, categorical approaches allow for identifying the most significant\nneural correlates in youths with severe forms of irritability warranting\nclinical attention. Still, there is no gold standard for assessing irritability,\nand these various measures of irritability differ in measurement validity,\nreliability, and informant agreement across development.  None of the existing measures are sensitive to\nlow-to-modest irritability symptoms \u2014an issue highly relevant for typically\ndeveloping and/or community samples. More justification in the choice of\nirritability assessments is preferable, as irritability-related subscales or\nitems extracted from larger pools, compared to those specifically designed for\nassessing irritability, might vary psychometrically and relate subtly to\ndifferent aspects of neural dysregulation.  This relates\nto the previous discussion on characterizing the different aspects of\nirritability, as increasing studies rely on latent variable techniques  or individual assessment items  to index tonic and phasic irritability, but their\npsychometric properties await critical evaluation. \n\nLow study availability precluded us from examining age- and sex-related\ndifferences in neural convergence. However, we conducted a sensitivity analysis\nfocusing on pre- and early-adolescents only (<15 years of age) and found\nno convergent results. Thus, questions remain as to whether age- and sex-related\npubertal and hormonal changes might have contributed to the null results, as\nrecent evidence points to an interplay between pubertal hormones and maturation\nof fronto-limbic circuitries,  overlapping with the threat and reward processing pathways\nof irritability.  Studies that\ndirectly examined sex moderation on irritability-related neural responses are\nscarce, with only one study finding significant sex moderation effects during\nfrustrative nonreward processing.  Together with studies that analyzed sex as a covariate or\nmain effect,  these sex differences emerged primarily\nin the salience network. \n\n\n### Heterogeneous fMRI Tasks and Analytical Procedures \n  \nOur null findings contrast with the few recent coordinate-based fMRI\nmeta-analyses on irritability-related constructs. For instance, 2 meta-analyses\nfound that state anger (k = 39)  and anger experience (k = 26)  were associated with activations in the\nanterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex,  and in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex.  In a more relevant\nmeta-analysis (k = 68), \nfrustrative nonreward processing was associated with deactivation in the\norbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and ventral striatum, and\nheightened activation in the midcingulo-insular regions. It is thought that the\ndeactivation patterns represent frontal neural deficiency, which disinhibits\naggressive responding to frustrative events.  These meta-analyses, however, were performed in\nprimarily healthy young adults, with a larger collection of studies using more\nhomogeneous tasks. Therefore, such spatial convergence might not generalize to\ndevelopmental clinical groups (childhood irritability in this case) in which\nneural convergence is a complex function of developmental changes, symptom\nvariations, and compensatory neural mechanisms. \n\nRegarding other relevant phenotypes, a recent meta-analysis in youths\nwith depression or anxiety disorders (k = 48)  reported increased activation in the\nbilateral amygdala (especially for anxiety disorders) across a range of emotion\nregulation and decision-making tasks, which extended to the anterior cingulate\nand putamen\u2014regions in the salience network that were also reported in\nsome of the individual irritability studies reviewed here. However, no\nsignificant clusters were found when restricting to youths with major depressive\ndisorder (MDD), suggesting that the lack of neural convergence may not be an\nissue specific to the irritability phenotype. \n\nDiverse fMRI tasks across multiple neurocognitive domains have been used\nin past studies in irritability. Although a conceptual framework categorizing\nstudies into emotional reactivity, cognitive control, and reward processing was\nuseful to facilitate systematic analyses of neural convergence, within-domain\nheterogeneity was still present. This is evident in the emotional reactivity\nstudies reviewed. Although most of these studies were fundamentally facial\nemotion recognition tasks, these paradigms involved varied task demands probing\npassive and active attentional processes, priming, and control conditions\nranging from nose width ratings to gender and shape recognition that potentially\ninvolve different psychological processes. Stimulus variations such as the use\nof morphed vs non-morphed faces, types of emotions, valence and arousal, and\npresentation duration might address specific research questions concerning\nemotion processing in irritability; but that likely further contributes to\nnonconvergence across individual studies, given the corresponding impact on the\nunderlying psychological operations and hence associated neural responses.\nSimilarly, a variety of reward tasks were used. Of note, these reward tasks\nvaried in the reward contexts, as some involved the elicitation of frustration\nvia rigged reward,  whereas others occurred in more\nconventional reward settings.  A recent study found task-dependent functional connectivity\nto be predictive of irritability symptom severity only when frustration was\nevoked during scan, \nhighlighting the importance of emotional contexts. There is also inconsistency\nin operationalizing the temporal dimensions of reward processing in these reward\ntasks. We strove to reconstruct the full temporal course by carefully pooling\nstudy contrasts that reflect the core phases of reward processing (eg, reward\nanticipation, reward receipt, and feedback), and yet no significant convergent\nclusters were found. Studies probing cognitive control are mixed, partly because\nthere is no generally agreed-upon definition of cognitive control dysfunctions\nin irritability. These subordinate functions range from inhibitory\ncontrol,  reversal learning,  to attention control processes ; the latter are shared with emotional\nreactivity and reward processing studies that have attention-related\ndemands.  Although we do not rule out the\npossibility that the neural correlates of irritability are indeed very\nheterogeneous because of its transdiagnostic nature and the myriad\nneurocognitive functions that are potentially affected, the heterogeneity in\nfMRI task designs reflect a lack of consensus in the key neurocognitive\nconstructs of interest and the empirical approaches in probing those\nneurocognitive processes in irritability research. Study variances related to\ntask heterogeneity are coupled with heterogeneous statistical thresholds in the\nfMRI analyses. Therefore, the absence of neural convergence is perhaps less\nsurprising. \n\nStructural MRI obviates validity and reliability issues in task\nfMRI.  Our review on\nstructural MRI suggests potential irritability-related volumetric reductions in\nwidely distributed frontal regions, possibly implicating decreased top-down\nregulation in irritable mood and outbursts.  A few studies report volumetric\nreduction in the salience network, possibly implicating neural alterations\nassociated with early stimulus detection and response.  However, this structural review is based on a small number\nof studies using different irritability measures. This highlights the need for\nmore research, especially those studies examining other morphometrics such as\ncortical thickness and surface area. Thus, it remains unclear whether\nlimitations with task fMRI and/or constructs/measures of irritability\ncontributed to the lack of convergence in fMRI findings. \n\nCommon to many fields of research, bias for publishing novel and\nsignificant findings contributes to the use of individualized task designs,\nflexible preprocessing pipelines, analytical procedures, and thresholding that\nare unique to individual studies. These research practices often give rise to\nstudy findings that are replicable only in well-powered fMRI analyses with\nsufficiently large samples and representative ranges of irritability symptoms,\nboth of which are difficult to achieve in individual laboratories. However, this\ndoes not necessarily suggest that task fMRI studies on irritability should be\nreplaced with an alternative neuroimaging modality, as task fMRI is critical to\nunderstanding the functional significance of altered neural functions and their\nassociations with irritability.  In addition to neural activation, task\nfMRI enables investigation on functional connectivity. Indeed, emerging evidence\nshows that individual differences in irritability may be reflected in the\ndisrupted integration between and within brain regions and networks.  As a limitation, the current meta-analysis inferred\nfunctional neural convergence based on peak coordinates; future work with a\ndirect synthesis of full voxelwise statistical maps may bypass some of the\nissues related to the researcher\u2019s degrees of freedom in the\npreprocessing, analyzing, and thresholding of fMRI data and may uncover neural\ndysfunctions associated with irritability. \n\nSeveral recommendations are noted here for moving irritability fMRI\nresearch forward. First, an agreed-upon battery of irritability phenotype\nmeasurements will facilitate comparisons and data pooling across studies and\nincrease sample sizes, potentially improving the convergence of findings.\nLikewise, we encourage more detailed assessments of symptom dimensions in\nirritability, parsing possibly different neurobiological substrates of tonic and\nphasic irritability. Relatedly, more thorough clinical assessments of\ncomorbidities would provide the necessary information to clarify\nirritability-related neural responses that are independent of co-occurring\nsymptoms and heterogeneous features within specific diagnostic groups (eg, ADHD\nand ASD). Second, sample characteristics, including information about\npsychiatric medication, pubertal development, and other environmental risk\nfactors (eg, socioeconomic disadvantages and chronic stress) are useful to\nidentify exogenous sources of individual variances, enhancing the robustness of\nfMRI findings. Transparent reporting of potentially overlapping participants and\na wider range of recruitment sites, especially in underrepresented populations\nand/or those at risk for severe irritability, are needed to diversify the study\nsamples. Third, mining population-based neuroimaging datasets, such as the\nAdolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD),  provides the opportunity to improve\nclinical heterogeneity and to overcome small sample sizes in individual studies.\nAs measures specifically designed for assessing irritability symptoms are not\ncommon in these large-scale studies (eg, ARI),  we advocate for including such\nirritability measures that are well-validated and reliable in future study\nprotocols. Fourth, fMRI task heterogeneity implies that a better incentive\nstructure is needed to motivate the use of fMRI tasks that validly and reliably\nprobe neurocognitive functions informing the pathophysiology of irritability.\nThis does not mean imposing a stringent framework on fMRI paradigms, as testing\nnovel task designs in individual laboratories are valuable training\nopportunities for early-career researchers and benefit new hypothesis\ngeneration.  Instead,\npre-registration of fMRI task designs and analysis plans can promote task\nhomogeneity and standardized processing pipelines across individual studies,\nwhile ensuring reasonable between-study variations that address specific\nresearch questions. Fifth, open task and data sharing are currently underway in\nour laboratories to promote collaborative irritability research. Pediatric\nneuroimaging in youths with irritability can be challenging, especially when\nfrustration tasks and deception are involved. Making mock scan protocols,\nexperimental setups, task instructions, and debriefing procedures openly\navailable may help to overcome this challenge. Sixth, the past fMRI studies on\nirritability were largely conducted at a regional level. Multivariate approaches\nexamining neural coactivation and connectivity patterns across the whole brain\nmay provide a more comprehensive understanding of the neural circuitries and\ninteractions mediating irritability.  Other neuroimaging modalities such as connectivity\nstudies using fractional anisotropy  and functional near-infrared spectroscopy measuring\nreal-time cortical neural responses during interactive tasks  offer novel angles to study neural\ndysfunctions in irritability. Studies analyzing both task fMRI and task-free\nresting state data also allow for clarifying task-related neural\nnoises.  Finally,\nfrustration realistically occurs in social and interactive contexts among\nyouths. To enhance ecological validity, future irritability research might\ninvestigate neural dysfunctions during frustrative social nonreward, such as\nsocial rejection. \n\nThis study is the first systematic review and quantitative synthesis of\nthe task fMRI studies on irritability. We observed vast clinical heterogeneity\nand methodological variations across studies, potentially contributing to the\nabsence of neural convergence in irritability as shown in the quantitative\nsyntheses across neurocognitive domains and sensitivity syntheses restricting\nstimulus type, irritability measures, and developmental ages. Nonetheless, when\nimplemented thoughtfully, task fMRI studies provide valuable empirical evidence\nfor elucidating the functional neural mechanisms mediating irritability\nsymptoms. The use of large samples, common standardized measurements of\nirritability, comprehensive assessments of heterogeneous clinical features, and\nmore homogeneous fMRI tasks probing well-defined neurocognitive domains central\nto the pathophysiology of irritability are key to improving research practice\nand data quality in the field. Open science and innovative research methods such\nas multivariate analysis and multimodal neuroimaging provide novel avenues for\nadvancing the current state of knowledge in the neural mechanisms of\nirritability. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9892288, "text_md5": "a6af3a69afd708a353e043a886b6e58a", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 182], "journal": [183, 217], "publication_year": [219, 223], "title": [234, 322], "keywords": [336, 400], "abstract": [413, 2533], "body": [2542, 49239]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 35944754, "doi": "10.1016/j.jaac.2022.05.014", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9892288", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9892288"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9892288\">9892288</a>", "list_title": "PMC9892288  Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Task-based fMRI Studies in\nYouths With Irritability"}
