Using just the reported coordinates it is also possible to meta-analyse coactivated regions to reveal a network-like structure of coordinate clusters (network nodes) distributed at the coactivated locations and a measure of the coactivation strength (network edges), which is determined by the presence/absence of reported activation. Here a new coordinate-based method to estimate a network of coactivations is detailed, which utilises the Z score accompanying each reported. Coordinate based meta-analysis of networks (CBMAN) assumes that if the activation pattern reported by independent studies is truly consistent, then the relative magnitude of these Z scores might also be consistent. It is hypothesised that this is detectable as Z score covariance between coactivated regions provided the within study variances are small. Advantages of using the Z scores instead of coordinates to measure coactivation strength are that censoring by the significance thresholds can be considered, and that using a continuous measure rather than a dichotomous one can increase statistical power. CBMAN uses maximum likelihood estimation to fit multivariate normal distributions to the standardised Z scores, and the covariances are considered as edges of a network of coactivated clusters (nodes). Here it is validated by numerical simulation and demonstrated on real data used previously to demonstrate CBMA. Software to perform CBMAN is freely available.
