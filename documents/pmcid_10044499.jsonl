Computed from brain resting-state functional MRI time series, ReHo is also sensitive to fluctuations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) that in turn may be influenced by cerebrovascular health. We accessed cerebrovascular health with Framingham cardiovascular risk score (FCVRS). We hypothesize that ReHo signal may be influenced by regional CBF; and that these associations can be summarized as FCVRS\u2192CBF\u2192ReHo. We used three independent samples to test this hypothesis. A test-retest sample of   N   = 30 healthy volunteers was used for test-retest evaluation of CBF effects on ReHo. Amish Connectome Project (ACP) sample (  N   = 204, healthy individuals) was used to evaluate association between FCVRS and ReHo and testing if the association diminishes given CBF. The UKBB sample (  N   = 6,285, healthy participants) was used to replicate the effects of FCVRS on ReHo. We observed strong CBF\u2192ReHo links (  p  <2.5 \u00d7 10 ) using a three-point longitudinal sample. In ACP sample, marginal and partial correlations analyses demonstrated that both CBF and FCVRS were significantly correlated with the whole-brain average (  p  <10 ) and regional ReHo values, with the strongest correlations observed in frontal, parietal, and temporal areas. Yet, the association between ReHo and FCVRS became insignificant once the effect of CBF was accounted for. In contrast, CBF\u2192ReHo remained significantly linked after adjusting for FCVRS and demographic covariates (  p  <10 ). Analysis in   N   = 6,285 replicated the FCVRS\u2192ReHo effect (  p   = 2.7 \u00d7 10 ). In summary, ReHo alterations in health and neuropsychiatric illnesses may be partially driven by region-specific variability in CBF, which is, in turn, influenced by cardiovascular factors. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nRegional homogeneity (ReHo) is an index of synchronization between the blood o ygenation level dependent (BOLD) time series of a vo el and its nearest neighbors in resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) time series data ( ;  ). This measure is speculated to be informative of local \u2013 rather than long-distance \u2013 resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) ( ;  ). It is considered a promising biomarker in neuropsychiatric illnesses and has been linked to symptoms, cognition and other clinical features in schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, stroke, and other illnesses ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The findings of lower ReHo signal in patients vs. controls is commonly interpreted as evidence for connectivity deficits or aberrant synchronization ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, we lack a clear mechanistic explanation for these findings, due to limited empirical data available to support the assumption that ReHo is driven by local neural connectivity differences ( ;  ). \n\nReHo has been studied and validated in laboratory animal models in which ReHo findings have been demonstrated to be robust and replicable ( ;  ;  ,  ). For example, in a stress-based rat model of depression, widespread ReHo alterations were observed in cortical regions in stressed animals and these changes were reversed or attenuated by pharmacological interventions ( ;  ). Changes in regional ReHo values were also observed in cortical and subcortical areas under different anesthesia medications in laboratory rodents ( ). Ketamine administration in rhesus monkeys increased ReHo in the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, and hippocampus but decreased ReHo in the prefrontal cortex ( ). Similar to human studies, most of the ReHo changes in animal disease models or pharmacological challenges have been interpreted as changes in local brain functional states or resting local intrinsic synchrony ( ;  ). However, like most human studies, these findings provide insufficient evidence for exclusively linking ReHo changes to synchronized local neural activity. \n\nPharmacological interventions in laboratory animals, including ketamine and anesthetic agents, are known to induce significant changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood pressure, and pulse pressure ( ;  ;  ;  ). When neighboring vo els are examined for temporal correlations, any signals with shared local temporal fluctuations may contribute to the correlation strength. Synchronized neuronal firing, e.g., functional connectivity, may explain the synchronized BOLD signals. However, temporal synchronization can also be produced by fluctuations in the regional CBF as the neighboring vo els are likely to share the same blood supply, resulting in increased or decreased ReHo coefficients beyond that produced by neuronal synchronization. If true, this should not be interpreted as the \u2018local connectivity\u2019 as it would result from a shared vascular or systemic cause of shared events among neighboring vo els rather than a neuronal cause. \n\nReHo signals may still reflect the underlying neural rather than vascular mechanism, when regional CBF changes follow the level of neural activity in neighboring vo els. This is possible because in healthy conditions regional CBF is rigorously regulated to equalize the metabolic demand and supply for neural activities ( ). One way to disentangle the neuronal vs. vascular relationship is to look at the roles of non-neural vascular contributions. CBF normally takes up to a \u223c15% proportion of the cardiovascular output ( ), but cardiovascular risk factors can alter the temporal trends and magnitude of the CBF response to neuronal activity both globally and regionally ( ). If system-level cardiovascular effects can be shown to significantly contribute to ReHo directly or through its effect on CBF, it gives weight to the argument that ReHo is not exclusively a measure of local neuronal functional connectivity. \n\nWe used a recognized index of cardiovascular disease risk (CVDR) factors, the FCVRS ( ), to test the hypotheses that, first, FCVRS may impact ReHo in a regional specific pathway (FCVRS \u2192 ReHo regions), and second, this effect is mediated by CBF, also in a regional specific pathway (FCVRS \u2192 CBF region \u2192 ReHo region). Further, the regional effect can be isoregional (i.e., ReHo is affected by CBF from the same region) or hetero-regional (e.g., ReHo of a region(s) is affected by CBF from other regions, not just the same region(s)). We performed exploratory multivariate mediation analysis to parse the total effect of FCVRS on regional ReHo into the direct FCVRS effect on ReHo (no CBF involved) and mediated pathways whereby FCVRS affects ReHo through iso or hetero-CBF regional changes. This approach adds the necessary spatial information to the traditional mediation pathway analysis by considering the likely three-dimensional mediations. \n\nWe addressed these questions in a sample of adult participants with no history of psychiatric illnesses from the Amish Connectome Project (ACP), which included members of the Old Order Amish/Mennonite (OOA/M) population. Compared to the general United States population, at the population level the OOA/M have a more homogeneous rural lifestyle and have low rates of substance misuse ( ;  ). Together this may allow identification of potential cerebral blood supply effects on ReHo with reduced confounds. We addressed the replicability and generalizability of our findings by repeating the FCVRS and ReHo analysis in a large and inclusive sample of healthy, non-psychiatric participants in the UK Biobank (UKBB). A longitudinal dataset acquired at three different time points (Neuroimaging Center, University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), Netherlands) were used and analyses were performed using whole-brain average signals to address the replicability and generalizability of the CBF effect on the ReHo measures. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Study participants \n  \n N   = 30 (age: 25 \u00b1 5 years [mean \u00b1 standard deviation]; 7 males/23 females) participated in the test-retest study after providing written informed consent. The health status was defined by the absence of any active or chronic disease or positive signs on a complete physical examination including vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram, hematology, blood chemistry, serology and urinalysis ( ). The study was carried out according to local regulations and the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines at a single center (UMCG, Netherlands). Subjects were scanned at three different time points; a screening period of 28 days (15\u00b13 days before the baseline Visit 1, called Visit 0) preceded the study assessment period and subsequently, two study visits (Visit 1 and Visit 2) were performed fourteen days apart. \n\n N   = 204 OOA/M participants (94 males/110 females, age: 39.3 \u00b1 16.9 years, mean \u00b1 s  .  d.) with no history of psychiatric diagnoses from the ACP ( ). This cohort shares a similar rural upbringing and lifestyle that includes the same level of basic school education, diet, and occupations, and virtually no illicit substance use and offers a population-level reduction in environmental heterogeneity that may confound cardiovascular and cerebral blood flow measures. Individuals having a lifetime diagnosis of psychiatric disorders were excluded in this analysis to avoid confounded effects of psychiatric illnesses. Other exclusion criteria included major medical and neurological conditions that might affect gross brain structures - such as developmental disability, head trauma, seizure, stroke, or transient ischemic attack. All participants provided written informed consent on forms approved by the Institutional Review Board of University of Maryland Baltimore. \n\nA UKBB sample of 6285 participants (3384 males/ 2901 females, age: 56.6 \u00b1 7.5 years, mean \u00b1 s  .  d.) who were selected from \u223c17,000 subjects with imaging data provided by the first UKBB release. These subjects were selected to be free from any neuropsychiatric or metabolic disorder such as types 1 and 2 diabetes, hypo- or hyperthyroidism, brain trauma and other ICD-10 diagnostic status and were included for replication of the findings related to FCVRS and ReHo measurements. \n\n\n### Arterial-spin labeling data acquisition and processing \n  \nThe ACP sample had arterial-spin labeling (ASL) data, but the UKBB sample had no ASL data. ASL data for ACP sample were acquired on a 3 T Siemens Prisma scanner with 64 channels, using three-dimensional pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) with background suppressed gradient and spin-echo sequence consisting of 13 pairs of labeled and control scans. The acquisition parameters were spatial resolution = 2.5 mm \u00d7 2.5 mm \u00d7 2.6 mm, matri  size = 96 \u00d7 96 with 58 axial slices, repetition time/echo time (TR/TE) = 4000/37 ms, flip angle = 120\u00b0, field of view (FoV) read = 220 mm, FoV phase = 100%, post-label delay = 1700 ms, labeling duration = 1650 ms. Total scan time was appro imately 10 min. A 3D T -weighted image was acquired for anatomical reference, as well as gray and white matter tissue segmentation, with the following parameters: TR = 2400 ms, TE = 2.22 ms, inversion time = 1000 ms, flip angle = 8\u00b0, matri  = 300 \u00d7 320, slices per slab = 208, 0.8 mm \u00d7 0.8 mm spatial resolution with slice thickness = 0.80 mm. A volume of M  image was also acquired without background suppression to normalize the control-label difference for CBF quantification. To suppress effects of noise, the M  image was smoothed with a 5 mm Gaussian-kernel, as recommended in a recent ASL white paper ( ). \n\nASL dataset at Neuroimaging Center, UMCG, Netherlands was acquired using a 3 T clinical scanner (Intera, Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands) with a 32-channel head coil. For CBF computation 60 pairs of labeled and control images with 17 axial slices, 7 mm slice thickness and no gap covering the whole brain were collected using a pCASL sequence (  TR   = 4000 ms;   TE   = 14 ms,   FA   = 90\u00b0; labeling duration = 1650 ms; post-labeling delay = 1600 ms; labeling gap = 2 cm; in-plane resolution = 3 \u00d7 3 mm ). A 2D single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) readout with fat suppression was used. Additionally, a separate proton density image (  M  ) was collected to obtain vo el-wise intensity of fully relaxed blood spins. \n\nCBF data analysis was performed with the FSL software package; perfusion was estimated by using a standard single compartment ASL model; partial volume effects correction was performed with a spatially regularized method ( ). Spatial regularization, motion correction and partial volume corrections were performed in FSL v6.0.1. The high-resolution structural image provides partial volume estimates (PVE) for the different tissue types (gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid). The high-resolution PVE images obtained from a structural image were then converted to the ASL image space using a transformation matri  from the structural space to the ASL native image space. Partial volume corrected CBF maps were used to extract the regional CBF signals from parcellated GM (both cortical and subcortical) and WM structures, separately for both hemispheres, defined in the brain template \u2018Everything Parcellation Map in Eve Space\u2019 atlas- also called the \u2018EvePM\u2019 atlas ( ); we refer to this as the JHU-MNI atlas from now on. EvePM atlas allows automated segmentation of gray matter and white matter structures with hemispheric differentiation. This atlas combined a deep gray matter parcellation map derived from a single-subject quantitative susceptibility map with white matter parcellation map into an MNI coordinate and included 107 ROIs. The extracted signals were used in the statistical analyses. \n\n\n### Resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) data acquisition, processing, and analyses \n  \nAll ACP participants underwent rsfMRI data acquisition that consisted of two runs. Oblique axial acquisitions alternated between phase encoding in the anterior-to-posterior (AP) and posterior-to-anterior (PA) directions within a single run. Separate single-band reference images, acquired for phase encoding in AP and PA directions, were used for spatial distortion correction. RsfMRI data were acquired using the following parameters: TR = 780 ms, TE = 34.4 ms, spatial resolution of 2-mm isotropic vo els, matri  size = 104 \u00d7 104 with 72 axial slices, number of volumes = 420, flip angle = 52\u00b0, multi-band acceleration factor = 8, and bandwidth = 2186 Hz/pi el. \n\nUKBB rsfMRI data were acquired on 3 T Siemens Skyra scanners with the standard Siemens 32-channel receive head coil using the following parameters: TR = 735 ms, TE = 39 ms, spatial resolution of 2.4-mm isotropic vo els, matri  size = 88 \u00d7 88 with 64 axial slices, number of volumes = 490, flip angle = 52\u00b0, and multi-band acceleration factor = 8. A separate single-band reference image was acquired and used as the reference scan for head motion correction and alignment to other modalities ( ). \n\nRsfMRI dataset at UMCG were acquired on a 3 T clinical scanner using a 32-channel head coil. 244 vol of BOLD effect sensitive images covering the whole brain were acquired using a gradient-echo EPI sequence (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms; FA = 90\u00b0; 39 axial slices with 1 mm gap, nominal in-plane resolution 3 \u00d7 3 mm  ; slice thickness at 3 mm) ( ). \n\nThe resting state analysis workflow developed by the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium was used to process the rsfMRI data; processing steps have been described in full detail in prior publications ( ,  ). The analysis workflow uses Marchenko-Pastur principal component analysis denoising ( ) to improve signal-to noise ratio (SNR)/temporal SNR of the time series data. In this workflow, a transformation is computed registering the base volume to the ENIGMA EPI template, which is used as a common anatomical spatial reference frame for registration purposes. This step was followed by 3D deconvolution of methodological covariates, and regression of the global signal ( ). Each functional volume was registered to the volume with the minimum outlier fraction for head motion correction, where each transformation was concatenated with the transformation to standard space, to avoid unnecessary interpolation. We removed the effects of the following nuisance variables by using them as covariates using multiple linear regression analysis: the si  (three rotations and three translations) motion parameter and their temporal derivatives, and time courses from the local white matter and cerebrospinal fluid from lateral ventricles. Motion was estimated as the magnitude of displacement from one time point to the next including neighboring time points and outlier vo els fraction (> 0.1). Time points with excessive motion (>0.2 mm) were excluded from further statistical analysis. Images were spatially normalized to the ENIGMA EPI template in MNI standard space for group analysis and then to JHU-MNI atlas template in order to extract measures from ROIs based on this template. The pre-processed data was then used for ReHo calculations. \n\n\n### ReHo analysis \n  \nReHo was designed to investigate changes in local spontaneous brain activity by performing a nearest neighbor analysis of similarity of the BOLD time-series and assigning a score, called Kendall\u2019s coefficient of concordance (KCC) ( ) per vo el. The KCC score is calculated per vo el based on signals from neighboring vo els as:  . Here,   W   is the KCC among given vo els, ranging from 0 to 1;   R   is the sum rank of the   i   time point;   R   = ((  n   + 1)  K  )/2 is the mean of the   R  \u2019s;   K   is the number of time series within a measured cluster (  K   is set to be 7, 19, or 27), and   n   is the number of ranks (  n   = number of volumes) ( ).   K   was set to be 27, which is appropriate for covering all directions in 3D space and to optimize the trade-off between mitigation of partial volume effects and generation of Gaussian random fields ( ). For each subject, the ReHo map was computed in three-dimensional volumetric space using the MATLAB function \u2018  y_reho.m  \u2019 available in the   DPABI_V3.0_171210   package. \n\nTo extract global and regional ReHo and CBF signals, we selected the JHU-MNI atlas that includes both GM and WM brain structures from both hemispheres. Global signals, based on this atlas, included the contribution from these both GM and WM regions. Also, time courses from the local WM and CSF from the lateral ventricles were modeled using multiple linear regression analysis, and then removed as regressors of no interest during data processing. Using these measures, we performed correlation analyses between ReHo signals with CBF signals and cardiovascular disease risk score and also performed the mediation analysis. For the UKBB sample, we extracted the global and average regional ReHo signals for the same ROIs. We then performed correlation analysis between these signals and the cardiovascular disease risk score. \n\n\n### FCVRS \n  \nCardiovascular disease risk was assessed using the FCVRS. The FCVRS summarizes the estimated contribution of risks as a FCVRS value from systolic blood pressure, blood plasma lipid measures including total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and other factors such as diabetes, age, sex, and smoking status ( ). The original FCVRS study provided the% risk corresponding to the actual score side by side for clinical use ( ). For the ACP sample, we analyzed the relationships between FCVRS, CBF and ReHo signals. The FCVRS from UKBB participants were used to investigate the relationship with the ReHo signals. \n\nAll analyses were performed after regressing the effects of age to address the potential collinearity in the Framingham cardiovascular risk scores and aging-related decline in CBF. We had no specific hypotheses regarding sex-related differences and therefore all analyses were also corrected for sex of the participants. \n\n\n### Exploratory mediation analyses \n  \nEstablishing causal links using cross-sectional data is challenging. We used the causal discovery analysis to demonstrate that ReHo and CBF are non-independent contrast mechanism that share a common risk factor ( ). The mediation analysis conducted in this study represents the test of the main hypothesis FCVRS \u2192 CBF \u2192 ReHo rather than establishing a causative biological mechanism ( ). \n\nWe first performed two simpler levels of mediation analyses to explore the data. In this analysis, we first calculated the whole-brain average CBF and ReHo data and performed the exploratory mediation analysis, based on whole-brain average signals to test whether whole-brain average CBF would significantly mediate the relationship between FCVRS and whole-brain average ReHo. Second, we performed an isoregional mediation analysis by arbitrarily restricting the CBF and ReHo signals to the same region, i.e., testing whether CBF from each region would significantly mediate the FCVRS effect on ReHo from the same region. For the primary analysis, we developed a mediation model with multiple mediators (i.e., CBF measures from one or many regions) and multiple outcomes (i.e., ReHo measures from one or many same and/or different regions), while age and sex were considered as covariates of no interest. The commonly used assumptions (e.g., sequential ignorability) were used for identification for the mediation model ( ). Here, we focused on a method we called hetero-regional multivariate mediation analysis, which refers to FCVRS \u2192 CBF in a given cluster(s) \u2192 ReHo in another cluster(s), where FCVRS affects CBF and then influences ReHo through CBF. The mediation effect can be interpreted as follows: FCVRS can influence ReHo of certain territories via certain CBF territories, where regions for CBF and regions for ReHo can be entirely separated, partially overlapped, or totally overlapped. We extracted mediation bi-clusters using tailored adaptive dense graph discovery algorithms ( ;  ). A mediation bi-cluster includes a set of CBF regions and the corresponding cluster ReHo regions, which reflects FCVRS influencing ReHo regions via the CBF regions within the bi-cluster. \n\nNext, we estimated the mediation effect for each mediation bi-cluster by decomposing the total effect of FCVRS on ReHo into a natural direct effect (NDE) and a natural indirect effect (NIE). The NDE was tested by assessing the effect of FCVRS on a ReHo region while controlling the effects of all related CBF regions and covariates. The standardized mediation effect was used to calculate NIE ( ). When multivariate mediators were selected, dimension reduction method was used to translate multivariate mediators into a few orthogonal components for estimating NDE and NIE ( ). Permutation tests were performed to control the family-wise error rate of cluster-wise inference ( ). We further explored whether specific measure(s) within the FCVRS had a predominant effect on CBF and/or ReHo. For statistical inference, the alpha level of 0.05 was used, while the corrected threshold for multiple comparison methods (e.g., false discovery rate and family-wise error rate controls) was also 0.05. The key mathematical formulae for this mediation analysis procedure were detailed in  . \n\nWe expanded this study by including a dataset acquired at three different time-points to establish the CBF\u2192 ReHo relationship using whole-brain average CBF and ReHo signals. In addition, we also performed the partial correlation analyses using the FCVRS, CBF and ReHo measures (results were detailed in the  ).   summarizes the datasets, measures and the tests used to address different parts of the research hypothesis. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### ReHo and CBF whole brain distribution maps \n  \nWhole brain distributions of resting ReHo and resting CBF are shown in  . By visual examination, bilateral frontal areas as well as the insula, parieto-occipital areas, temporal areas and cingulate gyrus showed greater CBF and ReHo signals. White matter regions exhibited lower ReHo and CBF signals, compared to other brain areas. Bilateral cerebellum showed lower CBF, but not lower ReHo signals, whereas bilateral fronto-orbital gyrus showed comparatively greater CBF signals, but lower ReHo signals. Overall, there was a similar visual appearance in the ReHo and CBF maps (  N   = 204), including the contrast between white and gray matter ( ). \n\n\n### ReHo and CBF relationship \n  \nThe test-retest dataset was used to establish a link between CBF and ReHo. The whole-brain average CBF signals drove the whole-brain average regional homogeneity signals (  p   \u2264 0.0028, Cohen\u2019s   f   > 0.46, within/between visits). The regression models (ReHo \u223c CBF + covariates) showed the statistically significant positive association in all visits and CBF signals drive the ReHo signals. Changes in CBF led to changes in ReHo signals from visit to visit. In addition, these CBF and ReHo measures were reproduceable. The full results are provided in   and   and  , see  . \n\nWe replicate the correlation between the whole-brain average ReHo and CBF signals were significantly and positively correlated (  r   = 0.46,   p   = 3.1 \u00d7 10 ) in ACP subjects and this correlation remained significant after correcting for age and sex (  r   = 0.41,   p   = 8.5 \u00d710 ) ( ). The ReHo and CBF signals of many regions likewise showed positive correlations, where the correlation coefficients in 42 out of 107 regions survived multiple comparisons correction (Bonferroni correction,   p  \u2217 < 0.05). The significant correlation values varied from 0.25 (  p   = 4.0 \u00d7 10 ) to 0.41 (  p   = 5.4 \u00d7 10 ) ( ), no negative correlation was found in any region. The significantly correlated regions include bilateral frontal, temporal, parietal (superior) and fronto-orbital regions; thalamus and insula, but most of the subcortical and white-matter regions showed statistically insignificant correlation between regional CBF and ReHo signals. Regional correlation values are in   ( ). \n\n\n### FCVRS contributions to CBF \n  \nThe FCVRS varied from \u22128 to 17 (mean: 2.8 \u00b1 5.2) for ACP participants aged 18\u201376 years (mean: 39.3 \u00b1 16.9 years). FCVRS was significantly and negatively correlated with the whole-brain average CBF signals (  r   = \u22120.41,   p   = 9.1 \u00d7 10 ) after correcting for age and sex ( ). The regional CBF signals from many regions likewise were negatively correlated with FCVRS: 59 out of 107 regions survived Bonferroni multiple comparisons correction (  p  \u2217 < 0.05). The significant regional correlation values ranged from \u22120.25 (  p   = 4.4 \u00d7 10 ) to   r   = \u22120.47 (  p   = 7.7 \u00d7 10 ), mainly in bilateral frontal, parietal, occipital, fronto-orbital, and insular regions and right pre/postcentral, caudate, and midline structures in midbrain, pons and cingulum. Most of the white matter and subcortical regions did not show statistically significant correlation between these signals ( ). Region-by-region correlation values are in   ( ). \n\n\n### FCVRS contributions to REHO \n  \nFCVRS was negatively correlated with the whole-brain average ReHo signals after correcting for age and sex (  r   = \u22120.31,   p   = 1.4 \u00d710 ) ( ). Regionally, FCVRS showed negative correlation with ReHo in 12 out of 107 regions after Bonferroni correction (values ranged from \u22120.25 (  p   = 4.6 \u00d7 10 ) to   r   = \u22120.40 (  p   = 1.8 \u00d7 10 ) ( ). The strongest correlations were observed for bilateral frontal, insular and medial fronto-orbital regions. Mostly sub-cortical and white-matter regions were statistically insignificant. The region-by-region correlation coefficients are shown in   ( ). \n\nOverall, the correlation coefficients computed between FCVRS and CBF and those computed between FCVRS and ReHo are themselves also significantly correlated across regions (  r   = 0.57,   p   = 2.2 \u00d7 10  ;  ), suggesting that the regional distributions of the CBF and the ReHo signals showed a similar pattern of negative correlation with the FCVRS. \n\n\n### Replications in the UKBB \n  \nOur replication test was limited to the FCVRS and ReHo relationships as no ASL data was available to the UKBB sample. The UKBB participants were older: 40 \u221270 years (56.6 \u00b1 7.5 years), so their FCVRS was much higher at 10.2 \u00b1 3.5. Despite the large differences in FCVRS, FCVRS in UKBB was significantly and negatively correlated with the whole-brain average ReHo (  r   = \u22120.15,   p   = 2.7 \u00d7 10 ) after correcting for age and sex ( ). The regional ReHo signals also showed significant negative correlations with the FCVRS in 95 out of 107 regions after Bonferroni correction, with frontal areas again demonstrating the strongest effects ( ; values are provided in   ( )). This is consistent with the ACP data where higher FCVRS scores were associated with lower ReHo signals. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients between FCVRS and ReHo themselves showed a strong correlation between the ACP and UKBB across regions (  r   = 0.45,   p   = 1.1 \u00d7 10  ,  ). \n\n\n### Exploratory mediation analyses \n  \nBased on the mediation analyses performed to examine the potential mediators of the possible mediation process, three conditional independence tests provided: FCVRS \u2192 CBF|ReHo, correlation = \u22120.3095,   p  <0.0001; FCVRS \u2192 ReHo|CBF, correlation = \u22120.1548,   p   = 0.03441; and ReHo \u2192 CBF|FCVRS, correlation = 0.3852,   p  <0.0001. It then becomes clear that the only conditional independence after multiple testing correction is ReHo independent of FCVRS given CBF, which breaks the mediation pathways e.g., CBF \u2192 FCVRS \u2192 ReHo. Then, the collider does not hold because FCVRS and ReHo marginally correlated. Also, biologically CBF directly causes FCVRS changes is biologically less intuitive. Thus, the most likely causal pathway for mediation analyses was FCVRS \u2192 CBF \u2192 ReHo, which was   a prior   hypothesis.   summarizes the mediation analysis schemes. \n\n\n### Whole-brain average mediation analysis \n  \nThe mediation analysis performed using whole-brain average signal showed that the FCVRS effect on average ReHo was significantly mediated by average CBF. The mediation proportion effect was 51.9% (  p  <0.0001) based on the whole-brain averages ( ). \n\n\n### Whole-brain isoregional mediation analysis \n  \nWe examined the mediation effect of CBF in each region on the direct FCVRS effect on ReHo from the same region. The effect size values were computed region-by-region using mediation proportion (i.e., using component analysis for CBF, 1 component with \u223c80% variance explained). The mediation effects were found to be significant for 65 regions with false discovery rate (FDR,   q  <0.05) among the 107 regions. The brain-wide distribution of the region-by-region mediation effects is displayed in   (detailed in  ). The top ranked 18 of the 65 regions demonstrating a very strong mediation effect (FDR,   q  <10 ) included bilateral superior parietal, inferior frontal, orbito-frontal, temporal areas, and hippocampus, parahippocampal, thalamus and putamen. \n\n\n### Hetero-regional mediation analysis \n  \nCBF from one region is unlikely to mediate FCVRS effects on ReHo only in the same region. Thus, we carried out the primary multivariate mediation analysis using all potential combinatorial effects among 107 regional CBF measures as mediators and 107 regional ReHo measurements as the outcomes, to test for the patterns of mediation effects of FCVRS \u2192 one or any set of CBF regions \u2192 any one or any set of ReHo regions. The search heuristic was based on the null hypothesis that the probability of several CBF regions significantly mediating the effect of FCVRS on a set of ReHo regions converges to zero. The   p  -value matri  of this mediation analysis is shown in  . A systematic mediation pattern cluster ( ), assessed using cluster-wise inference, remained significant after correcting for the family-wise error rate (FWER,   p   = 0.001). This mediation cluster included 45 regions and showed that regional CBF of each of these 45 regions significantly mediated the relationship between FCVRS and a cluster of 43 regional ReHo signals ( ). The CBF cluster consisted of the bilateral frontal, temporal, occipital, orbito-frontal, parahippocampal and insular areas; and also, the left amygdala, right postcentral and right precuneus areas (  (i)). The ReHo cluster consisted of bilateral temporal, orbito-frontal, hippocampal, parahippocampal, superior parietal and inferior frontal areas, putamen, thalamus, cerebellum and cingulum, and right middle frontal and temporal regions and left pre/post-central and precuneus areas   (ii)). The mediation effect size values are in   (excel file). The CBF and ReHo territories only partially overlapped in 26 regions including bilateral inferior frontal, superior parietal, superior and inferior temporal, lateral and medial fronto-orbital areas ( ). Based on the mediation bi-cluster, we calculated the direct effect and indirect effect for each ReHo region by the orthogonal components of the multivariate mediators (i.e., 45 CBF regions). We found that \u223c82% of the variance of the mediators in the bi-cluster was explained by one mediating factor. For the indirect effect calculation based on this mediating factor for all 43 ReHo regions, the mean standardized mediation effect size (i.e., partial correlation product) \u00b1 standard deviation is medium, \u22120.105 \u00b1 0. 012. \n\nWe also explored whether specific individual measure(s) within the FCVRS had a predominant effect on CBF and/or ReHo. Briefly, significant mediation effects were found separately for age, total cholesterol and systolic blood pressure when each was considered as an individual factor for mediation analyses, suggesting that the mediation effects were not driven by a single measure. Most of the regions involved in the mediation effects in these analyses were the subsets of the regions that were significant in the mediation analysis using FCVRS. However, no significant mediation patterns were found for the other remaining components within the FCVRS measure. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study demonstrated strong linkage between CBF and ReHo signal on both global and regional levels and showed that variance in both signals is influenced by cardiovascular risk factors. We showed that the impact of cardiovascular risks quantified FCVRS can be summarized as FCVRS \u2192 CBF \u2192 ReHo. That is higher FCVRS is associated with lower CBF, especially in the frontal, temporal and parietal areas, which in turn reduces both global and regional ReHo. The multivariate mediation analysis identified a systematic pattern involving 45 CBF regions that significantly influenced 43 ReHo regions. The analyses indicated that the regional ReHo variance due to FCVRS were due to regional CBF changes. While the underlying mechanistic associations among FCVRS, CBF and ReHo are complex, this study suggests caution in interpreting ReHo-related functional and disease effects as evidence for altered local connectivity. Instead, individual differences in cerebrovascular health play a significant role and must be included in the interpretation of the findings. \n\nAbnormal ReHo signals are commonly reported in neuropsychiatric disorders ( ;  ;  ;  ). For instance, patients imaged during an acute psychotic episode exhibited increased ReHo in the medial/lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, and putamen and these findings were interpreted as evidence for increased local connectivity ( ,  ;  ;  ). Similarly, higher ReHo values were reported in the left superior frontal gyrus and left inferior temporal gyrus in early-onset Parkinson\u2019s disease ( ), left anterior cingulum cortex in major depressive disorder patients ( ), right superior temporal gyrus and bilateral hippocampus, parahippocampus, fusiform gyrus and cerebellum in patients with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder ( ), in right superior and inferior frontal gyrus in depressive patients compared to non-depressive patients ( ). The lower ReHo signal in frontal and temporal lobes in patients with schizophrenia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and mild cognitive impairment were associated with a lower working memory performance and other cognitive abilities ( ;  ) and lower ReHo in the right putamen in early-onset PD compared to late-onset ( ). Conversely, increased synchronized local activity in the medial prefrontal cortex could be pursued as a surrogate measure for treatment monitoring and may possibly be considered a marker for depression ( ). While most studies have appropriately interpreted these findings only as possibly related to local synchronized neural activities, to our knowledge, no studies have raised the question or tested whether cerebral blood flow, and overall cardiovascular risk factors, may also be contributors to the ReHo signals. \n\nFindings in this study would suggest that ReHo-related group differences in neuropsychiatric conditions may in part be related to systemic cerebrovascular differences and risk factors. Cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, aging, and higher cholesterol levels promote arterial stiffness, damages in small cerebral blood vessels, and formation of atherosclerotic plaques, causing altered dynamics in blood flow through stenotic cerebral blood vessels ( ). Subjects with neuropsychiatric disorders may have higher cardiovascular risk ( ;  ;  ) and accelerated aging ( ;  ;  ) and these differences may be difficult to fully control or remove in many ReHo studies. Moreover, pharmacological treatments for neuropsychiatric illnesses have side effects that adversely affect cardiovascular profiles and may be associated with metabolic syndrome ( ;  ) that may alter brain functions ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). As cardiovascular factors, most of them unlikely to be neuronal in origin, already show notable effects on ReHo in healthy, non-psychiatric controls in our study, it is likely that higher cardiovascular and metabolic risks in many neuropsychiatric illnesses may even more strongly impact the ReHo measures. ReHo measures can also be affected by the magnitudes of fMRI fluctuations (and SNR) and the size of the examined region, which may lead to have smaller ReHo values for subcortical regions and hence, the insignificant CBF-ReHo coupling as observed in these regions in our study. \n\nOur findings replicate the outcome of the research that demonstrated that higher FCVRS were associated with lower cerebral metabolic rate of glucose in medial frontal, orbitofrontal, and inferior frontal/insular areas ( ,  ). Furthermore, measures derived from the resting fMRI are expected to be correlated with CBF ( ;  ) and likewise ReHo measurements have been linked to CBF and/or perfusion imaging ( ;  ;  ). We replicated the negative trends between ReHo and FCVRS in the independent UKBB sample. The overall strength of the correlation between ReHo and FCVRS were lower in UKBB population (  r  =\u22120.15 vs. \u22120.31,   z   = 4.0,   p   = 0.0001). This could be driven by methodological differences between two datasets. The ACP dataset was collected using longer acquisition time (\u223c22 min vs. 6 min with similar repetition times 780 ms vs. 735 ms for ACP and UKBB, respectively) and at higher spatial resolution (isotropic 2 mm vs. isotropic 2.4 mm vo el). The higher temporal signal to noise ratio of the ACP sample may have led to more stable estimates of the global and regional ReHo values. \n\nWhile the ReHo measurements shared variance with CBF, this relationship is both complex and region-specific. The global and isoregional CBF was a robust mediator of the FCVRS effect on the global and isoregional ReHo signal. However, one-to-one analyses have overlooked the complex regional nature CBF\u2192ReHo relationship. The mediation analysis was used to test if CBF significantly mediated the isoregional FCVRS effect on ReHo. It showed small ( ) but significant (  q  <0.05) effect sizes across frontal, parietal, temporal areas and subcortical structures. We used a multivariate mediation analysis that treated regional CBF and ReHo patterns as two vectors and probed all-to-all associations. This analysis demonstrated that the FCVRS effects on regional ReHo signals were exerted by both the direct and mediated pathways. \n\nThe frontal lobe areas (inferior, middle and superior frontal gyri) showed the strongest correlations between the CBF and ReHo signals. They also showed the largest negative contrast with the FCVRS. Many of the frontal, parietal, temporal and deep gray matter brain regions that were identified as the key mediators are the areas associated with higher-order information processing and act as the key nodes in the functional networks ( ;  ;  ). We identified global and region CBF signals as the significant mediators of FCVRS to ReHo pathway, likely other factors such as cerebrovascular reactivity (also relating to CBF) may also mediate this relationship. The regional mediation map follows the blood supply patterns provided by carotid versus vertebral-basilar circulations, replicating the cerebrovascular illness risk patterns for stroke, cerebral ischemia and vascular dementia ( ;  ;  ;  ). The high metabolic demands of the frontal and parietal areas may make them more susceptible to the cardiovascular factors. In agreement, ReHo signal from these areas also showed higher correlations with cardiovascular risks, through CBF pathway. \n\nThe ENIGMA-pipeline used for calculation of rsfMRI-ReHo signal includes the global signal regression (GSR). The global signal in rsfMRI data is associated with head motion, respiration and cardiac rhythms ( ;  ). GSR is a necessary pre-processing step for ReHo analysis because the effects of GSR correction on ReHo are non-linear and complicated ( ; Zuo et al., 2013a) and methodological variance that contributes to GSR can artifactually inflate ReHo through global autocorrelation ( ;  ). The study by Li and colleagues demonstrated inclusion of GSR led to a significant improvement in the variance explained by the local rsFC in behavioral tasks in two independent datasets ( ). No analyses were performed to examine whether our study findings would differ without GSR, a shortcoming of the rsfMRI data processing. \n\nThis study has a few limitations. Analyses were performed in adult participants with no neuropsychiatric disorders and the FCVRS \u2192 CBF \u2192 ReHo pathway may be altered in participants with these disorders. Future analyses should be focused on the effects of FCVRS \u2192 CBF \u2192 ReHo in subjects with neuropsychiatric illnesses to understand the complex interplay between neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular illnesses on cerebral connectivity, circulation and metabolism. Mediation analyses included FCVRS as an independent variable and were also extended to the components of FCVRS. The analyses can still be extended to other measures such as low-/very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, C-reactive protein, hematocrit, body mass index, triglycerides, etc. though they were not included as contributing factors for FCVRS and may have influences on the CBF and ReHo measurements and their relationships. Potential confounders, such as levels of physical fitness, economic status, diet and others, were not included in the mediation analysis, which may in part influence the analysis results. Since this was a cross-sectional study, establishing directional effects in the full FCVRS \u2192 CBF \u2192 ReHo pathway is challenging. This overarching hypothesis needs to be confirmed in other cohorts too. We used a longitudinal test-retest sample to demonstrate the significance of the latter part (CBF \u2192 ReHo) of the pathway, but further analyses would be needed to demonstrate the validity of the full pathway. The ACP participants had higher environmental homogeneity, and shared a traditional rural upbringing, similar educational levels, and due to strong cultural prohibitions, had low rates of use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs ( ). A caution should be used in interpreting the research findings and requires assessments of the generalizability of these findings in additional populations. \n\nIn conclusion, ReHo findings are commonly interpreted as differences in localized cerebral connectivity, however, global, and regional ReHo signal show significant linkage with CBF and both are influenced by cardiovascular risk factors in a complex and regional way. We recommend that future studies consider differences in cardiovascular health while interpreting ReHo findings. Specifically, the ReHo findings in neuropsychiatry cohorts may in part reflect differences in the underlying cardiovascular disease risk rather than specifically the differences in local connectivity. This study highlighted the complex relationship between cardiovascular and nervous systems and advanced our knowledge on the biology of the underlying ReHo signal. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10044499, "text_md5": "81123e4f8c7172d582acbc92bacfca02", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 511], "journal": [512, 522], "publication_year": [524, 528], "title": [539, 628], "keywords": [642, 768], "abstract": [781, 2679], "body": [2688, 45566]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 35963506, "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119555", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10044499", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10044499"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10044499\">10044499</a>", "list_title": "PMC10044499  Cerebral blood flow and cardiovascular risk effects on resting brain regional homogeneity"}
