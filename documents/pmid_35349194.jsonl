Downregulation of the amygdala is one of the hallmarks of successful emotion regulation. Top-down inhibition of the amygdala is thought to involve activation of the executive control network. This reciprocal relationship, however, is not exclusive to explicit emotion regulation. It has been noted that any cognitively demanding task that activates executive control network may downregulate the amygdala, including a standard working memory task. Such downregulation is likely established in a load-dependent fashion with more cognitive demand leading to stronger deactivation. Using a coordinate-based meta-analysis, we examined whether a standard working memory task downregulates the amygdala similarly to cognitive reappraisal. We found that a standard 2-back working memory task indeed systematically downregulates the amygdala and that deactivated clusters strongly overlap with those observed during a cognitive reappraisal task. This finding may have consequences for the interpretation of the underlying mechanism of cognitive reappraisal: amygdala downregulation may be related to the cognitively demanding nature of reappraisal and not per se by the act of the reappraisal itself. Moreover, it raises the possibility of applying working memory tasks in clinical settings as an alternative emotion regulation strategy.
