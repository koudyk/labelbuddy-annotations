Numerous studies have examined regional activities during anticipation and outcome of win and loss in the monetary incentive delay task (MIDT). However, the great majority of studies reported findings of anticipation or outcome and of win or loss alone. It remains unclear how the neural correlates share and differentiate amongst these processes. We conducted an Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis of 81 studies of the MIDT (5,864 subjects), including 24 published since the most recent meta-analysis, to identify and, with conjunction and subtraction, contrast regional responses to win anticipation, loss anticipation, win outcome, and loss outcome. Win and loss anticipation engaged a shared network of bilateral anterior insula (AI), striatum, thalamus, supplementary motor area (SMA), and precentral gyrus. Win and loss outcomes did not share regional activities. Win and loss outcome each engaged higher activity in medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Bilateral striatum and right occipital cortex responded to both anticipation and outcome of win, and right AI to both phases of loss. Win anticipation vs. outcome engaged higher activity in bilateral AI, striatum, SMA and precentral gyrus and right thalamus, and lower activity in bilateral mOFC and posterior cingulate cortex as well as right inferior frontal and angular gyri. Loss anticipation relative to outcome involved higher activity in bilateral striatum and left AI. These findings collectively suggest shared and distinct regional responses during monetary wins and losses. Delineating the neural correlates of these component processes may facilitate empirical research of motivated behaviors and dysfunctional approach and avoidance in psychopathology.
