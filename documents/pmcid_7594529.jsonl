Under the assumption that diffusion within a voxel can be well described by a collection of diffusion tensors, several parameters of this diffusion tensor distribution can be derived, including mean size, variance of sizes, orientational dispersion, and microscopic anisotropy. The information provided by multidimensional diffusion encoding also enables us to decompose the sources of the conventional fractional anisotropy and mean kurtosis. In this study, we explored the utility of the diffusion tensor distribution approach for characterizing white-matter degeneration in aging and in Parkinson disease by using double diffusion encoding. Data from 23 healthy older subjects and 27 patients with Parkinson disease were analyzed. Advanced age was associated with greater mean size and size variances, as well as smaller microscopic anisotropy. By analyzing the parameters underlying diffusion kurtosis, we found that the reductions of kurtosis in aging and Parkinson disease reported in the literature are likely driven by the reduction in microscopic anisotropy. Furthermore, microscopic anisotropy correlated with the severity of motor impairment in the patients with Parkinson disease. The present results support the use of multidimensional diffusion encoding in clinical studies and are encouraging for its future clinical implementation. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms (akinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity) and a wide range of cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and autonomic dysfunctions ( ). Advanced age is a major risk factor for the development of PD and is also associated with faster motor decline ( ;  ). Pathologically, PD is characterized by widespread aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions in the form of Lewy pathology within both the neuronal cytoplasm (Lewy bodies) and axons (Lewy neurites) ( ;  ;  ). Neuropathological studies have indicated that Lewy pathologies evolve along major fiber pathways, beginning in the brain stem and eventually advancing to the neocortical regions ( ). Accumulating evidence has suggested that axonal degeneration is an early event in the process of neurodegeneration that is common to PD and other age-related neurological diseases ( ;  ). Non-invasive characterization of the neurodegeneration underlying the pathogenesis and progression of PD is of high clinical demand, because it will aid in the development of novel therapeutic strategies and in monitoring the effects of treatment. \n\nDiffusion MRI (dMRI) is uniquely sensitive to tissue features on the micrometer scale and therefore has been widely used to study neurodegeneration in aging ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and diseases ( ;  ). In PD, the majority of studies have applied diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) ( ) and have consistently reported smaller fractional anisotropy (FA) and greater mean diffusivity (MD) in the white matter of patients than of controls (for a recent review and meta-analysis see  ). Several groups ( ;  ,  ;  ,  ) further explored the utility of dMRI acquisition with higher b-values than used in DTI, which is typically analyzed by means of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) ( ). The works by  ,   showed that kurtosis in the white matter is reduced in patients and that DKI is more sensitive to white-matter degeneration than is DTI. Of note, several studies demonstrated that white-matter degeneration as detected by dMRI precedes macroscopic gray matter atrophy ( ;  ;  ), suggesting the potential of dMRI parameters as early biomarkers of PD. \n\nRegarding acquisition, both DTI and DKI use single diffusion encoding (SDE), which uses one pair of diffusion-sensitizing gradients. Multidimensional diffusion encoding ( ;  ), that can be realized by using either double diffusion encoding (DDE) ( ;  ), triple diffusion encoding ( ), or continuous gradient waveforms ( ;  ;  ), has recently gained attention in clinical studies because these methods provide more specific information about the tissue microstructure. For example, cumulant expansion of the DDE signal up to the fourth-order term of the gradient amplitude ( ) shows DDE provides unique information that is not contained in the standard diffusion and kurtosis tensors available with SDE. In addition to DTI/DKI parameters, at least two new properties of biological interest can be obtained: the microscopic anisotropy ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and the variance of isotropic diffusivities among individual microenvironments (compartments) ( ;  ). Several works have demonstrated that the microscopic anisotropy, a measure of diffusion anisotropy that is not confounded by orientational dispersion of axons or fibers, can be estimated reliably in nervous tissues ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Microscopic anisotropy has been shown to be useful for characterizing white-matter degeneration in aging ( ) and in multiple sclerosis ( ;  ). The variance of isotropic diffusivities has also been suggested to be promising for deducing the microstructural underpinnings of the diffusion changes in diseases like schizophrenia ( ). Moreover, multidimensional diffusion encoding enables us to decompose the sources of DTI/DKI parameters ( ;  ;  ;  ). Such analyses are expected to improve our understanding of neurodegeneration and the sensitivity of imaging to pathology. For example, if the pathology affects two underlying sources of a particular DTI/DKI parameter in opposite directions, as has been suggested in  ;  ,  , the sensitivity and interpretability of that parameter would be limited, whereas separation of each source may provide useful information. \n\nIn this study, we analyzed DDE data by using the covariance tensor framework ( ) that works under the diffusion tensor distribution (DTD) model ( ). Given the DTD model, continuous waveforms would offer more efficient diffusion weighting and faster acquisition than DDE ( ). We adopted DDE here because this study was planned before the definition of diffusion time for the continuous waveform was made by  . As DTD is a model for the long diffusion time limit where time-dependence is negligible ( ), we needed to compare the diffusion time of our measurement with the previous studies ( ;  ) to rationalize our assumption. The potential limitation arising from neglecting the effects of diffusion time is detailed in \u201cDiscussion.\u201d \n\nThe aim of this study was to identify the sources of DTI/DKI changes previously reported in aging and PD in terms of the DTD model parameters. We first analyzed correlation with age in healthy older subjects and then examined group differences between the healthy subjects and patients with PD. Finally, we investigated the correlations with the severity of motor impairment in the patients. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Theory \n  \n#### Model and Assumptions \n  \nLinking the MRI signal to specific tissue properties involves modeling, simplification of the complex reality relying on a few assumptions. By adopting the DTD model, we assume that the voxel consists of multiple, non-exchanging Gaussian compartments. More precisely, we model the diffusion within a voxel by a distribution of diffusion tensors (free, anisotropic diffusion) ( ;  ). In such case, the measurement can be fully characterized by the b-tensor (i.e., b-tensor encoding). In this regard, SDE is linear tensor encoding (LTE), whereas DDE provides planar tensor encoding (PTE) if we apply two diffusion encodings in non-colinear directions ( ;  ). Although the DTD model is certainly a crude assumption and not fully validated yet in human brain, describing the tissue by a combination of several diffusion tensors is a common starting point in most dMRI models currently used in clinical studies ( ). \n\nUnder the DTD model, the signal can be written as: \n\nwhere   S  (  B  ) is the signal,   S   is the signal without diffusion weighting,   B   is the b-tensor, and   D   is the diffusion tensor of each compartment. The bracket < > denotes the ensemble average over the voxel. The colon denotes a generalized scalar product between the two tensors,   B  :  D   = \u2211 \u2211  B   D  . \n\n\n#### Diffusion Parameters \n  \nMultidimensional diffusion encoding provides us means to extract summarizing statistics of the distribution of diffusion tensors. Eq. 1 can be expanded ( ;  ) to: \n\nwhere \u2297 denotes a tensor outer product. Here,   D   is the well-known, voxel-averaged diffusion tensor, and   C   is a fourth-order tensor called the covariance tensor. From   D   and   C  , several scalar parameters that summarize microstructural features, including DTI/DKI parameters, can be computed ( ;  ;  ). Below, we briefly describe the meanings of the parameters used in this study and their relations to each other. First, the DTI parameters MD and FA are defined ( ;  ;  ) as: \n\n V  (  D  ) denote the variance of eigenvalues of   D  , defined by using the eigenvalues \u03bb , \u03bb , and \u03bb  as  . MD and FA can be understood as the size and shape of the voxel-averaged diffusion tensor. The definition of \u03bcFA has a similar form to that of FA ( ;  ): \n\nUnlike FA, \u03bcFA is not influenced by orientational dispersion and purely reflects the anisotropy (shape) of microstructural environments. In addition, a measure of orientational dispersion (the orientational order parameter, OP) is defined ( ;  ) as: \n\nOP equals 1 for perfectly aligned orientations and equals 0 for fully isotropic dispersion. FA is influenced by both \u03bcFA and OP ( ): \n\nFurthermore, under the DTD assumption, mean kurtosis (MK), as defined in  , can be decomposed into two kurtosis sources ( ;  ): \n\nwhere \n\nare the isotropic and anisotropic kurtosis sources. Here,   V  (  D  ) is the variance of isotropic diffusivities among compartments (variance of sizes). The last term in Eq. 8 is a factor related to orientational dispersion and can be expressed as ( ;  ) \n\nUsing Eq. 11, Eq. 8 can be re-written as: \n\nIn this study, we report MD, FA, MK,   K  ,   K  , \u03bcFA, OP, and   V  (  D  ). Although the information represented by some parameters overlaps (e.g., both \u03bcFA and   K   are measures of microscopic anisotropy), having multiple forms of expression helps us to understand how the DTD parameters affect FA and MK (Eqs 7 and 12). \n\n\n\n### Participants \n  \nThis study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki for experiments involving humans. The Institutional Review Board approved this study, and all subjects gave written informed consent prior to participation. Twenty-three healthy older subjects (63.1 \u00b1 7.2 years old) and 27 patients with PD (66.1 \u00b1 6.6 years old) were enrolled. Patients with PD were diagnosed by neurologists on the basis of clinical diagnostic criteria of the Movement Disorder Society ( ). Motor function and disease stage were evaluated with the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale motor part (UPDRS-III) ( ) and the Hoehn and Yahr staging scale ( ). White-matter T2 hyperintensities (WMH) were rated according to the Fazekas scale ( ). The clinical and demographic characteristics of the participants are summarized in  . \n  \nDemographic features of the study participants. \n    \nBecause DDE is a relatively new technique for clinical research, we also examined the stability of the dMRI parameters in terms of scan\u2013rescan repeatability in a separate group of 4 young healthy subjects (3 male and 1 female, 25\u201337 years old), who underwent two scans on different days within a week. In these subjects, we also acquired conventional SDE for comparison. \n\n\n### Image Acquisition \n  \nThe subjects were scanned by using a clinical 3T scanner (MAGNETOM Prisma, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 64-channel head coil using a prototype sequence. DDE data were acquired using a monopolar spin-echo type acquisition. We used parallel (LTE) and perpendicular (PTE) pairs of diffusion sensitizing gradient blocks, with 30 uniformly distributed directions. Note that, under the DTD assumption, the direction of PTE can be characterized by the normal vector. For both LTE and PTE, we used two shells, which had b-values of 1000 and 2000 s/mm . One volume without diffusion weighting was also obtained. Thus, a total of 121 volumes were acquired. Other settings were image resolution = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm , TE = 93 ms, TR = 6300 ms, \u0394 = 18.3 ms, \u03b4 = 16.8 ms, mixing time = 24.9 ms, in-plane GRAPPA with acceleration factor 2, through-plane GRAPPA (SMS) with multiband factor 2, partial Fourier 6/8, 44 axial slices, and scan time 14 min. In addition, anatomical T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired and inspected by a neuroradiologist to rate Fazekas grade and to check for any other co-existing pathologies. SDE acquisition in the young subjects used the same b-values and 30 directions, resulting in a total of 61 volumes. The acquisition settings were identical to those of DDE, except \u0394 = 43.3 ms and \u03b4 = 36.4 ms. The scan time for SDE was 7 min. \n\n\n### Image Processing \n  \nImages were pre-processed by using FSL 6.0.1 ( ) and MRTrix3 ( ). Raw images were denoised ( ) and corrected for Gibbs artifact ( ), eddy currents and motion ( ), and B1 inhomogeneity ( ). For eddy-current correction of DDE, the second diffusion direction was used as the input to   eddy   in FSL ( ). The dMRI parameter maps were computed using the multidimensional diffusion MRI toolbox ( ). In a small number of voxels where the fitting resulted in negative values of   V  (  D  ), the fitting was repeated by using data smoothed with an isotropic 3D Gaussian kernel with sigma = 0.7 \u00d7 voxel size. \n\n\n### Stability of Measurements \n  \nUsing the scan-rescan data from the 4 young subjects, we computed the within-subject coefficient of variation (CV ), defined as  . Here, \u03bc is the grand mean and \u03c3  is the within-subject standard deviation. To compute CV  across the white-matter voxels, each subject\u2019s FA map was non-linearly registered into the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) template in FSL. The other dMRI parameter maps were also transferred into the standard space by using the same deformation. A white-matter mask was generated by thresholding the FA template at FA > 0.2. To mitigate partial volume effects with the gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the mask was further eroded by one voxel. We also report CV  for the mean value of each white-matter region of interest (ROI) that was used for the analyses of aging and PD (Section \u201cStatistical Analysis\u201d). \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nWe examined the effects of the subjects\u2019 characteristics (age, diagnosis, and UPDRS-III score) on the dMRI parameters by means of whole-brain voxel-wise analyses using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) ( ) and atlas-based ROI analyses. First, all subjects\u2019 FA images were aligned into a common space by means of non-linear registration, followed by creation of a mean FA skeleton. The threshold for creating the FA skeleton was set at FA > 0.2. Then, the aligned FA map of each subject was projected onto the FA skeleton. The other parameter maps were projected onto the mean FA skeleton by using the same transformation. Subsequently, the TBSS-processed skeletons were subjected to ROI analyses. Twelve white-matter ROIs were defined as the intersection of the white-matter skeleton and the JHU and Harvard\u2013Oxford atlases in FSL as in   ( ), and the mean value within each ROI was extracted. Specifically, the deep white-matter ROIs (the anterior corona radiata [ACR], posterior corona radiata [PCR], superior corona radiata [SCR], anterior and posterior limb of the internal capsule [ALIC, PLIC], and genu and splenium of the corpus callosum [GCC, SCC]) were defined by using the JHU atlas, and the subcortical white-matter ROIs (frontal, sensory-motor, parietal, occipital, and temporal cortices) were defined by using the Harvard\u2013Oxford atlas. \n  \nAtlas-based ROIs. Twelve ROIs were defined as the intersections between the TBSS-processed white-matter skeleton and the JHU and Harvard\u2013Oxford atlases in FSL (ACR/SCR/PCR, anterior/superior/posterior corona radiata; ALIC/PLIC, anterior/posterior limb of the internal capsule; GCC/SCC, genu/splenium of the corpus callosum). \n  \nWe opted not to exclude voxels with WMH from the analyses for the following two reasons. First, evidence suggests associations between WMH and the severity of motor and non-motor symptoms in PD ( ;  ). The pathophysiology of WMH is complex, and whether WMH are present in the patients because of incidental cerebrovascular disease or are a consequence of PD remains unclear ( ). Second, although TBSS allows the exclusion of voxels by using subject-specific lesion masks, this process causes differences in the degrees of freedom across voxels and may complicate the interpretation of statistical results ( ). \n\nFor both the TBSS and ROI-based analyses, we fit linear models where the dependent variable was each dMRI parameter. First, we examined the effect of age in the healthy subjects, using sex as a nuisance covariate. Then, we examined the differences between the healthy subjects and the patients with PD, using age and sex as nuisance covariates. Finally, we examined the correlation with UPDRS-III score in the patients, using age and sex as nuisance covariates. Because motor impairment might be correlated with age, we checked for multi-collinearity using the variance inflating factor (VIF) ( ). Although we used a stringent criterion of VIF < 4.0 ( ), VIF was below this threshold for all predictors in the linear models. Statistical inference of the linear models was conducted by using permutation analysis ( ). For computational efficiency, we used 2000 permutation and tail approximations ( ). For TBSS, threshold-free cluster enhancement ( ) was applied. The significance threshold was set at   P   < 0.05, corrected for family-wise error (FWE) for multiple comparisons across voxels or ROIs. For the ROI-based analyses, we also report results without FWE correction (  P   < 0.05) because these data may be informative for future studies with larger samples. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Scan-Rescan Repeatability \n  \nMD, FA, and MK showed excellent repeatability, with CV  below 6\u20138% for most of the white-matter voxels ( ). The values of CV  were similar between DDE and SDE. \u03bcFA and OP also showed CV  below 8% for most of the voxels. The parameters of size variance [  K   and   V  (  D  )] showed greater CV , falling in the range of 10\u201325% for most of the voxels. As for ROI-based measurements, CV  was below 2% in all ROIs for MD, FA, \u03bcFA, and OP ( ). MK and   K   exhibited slightly greater values of CV  ranging from 0.5 to 4.8%. Although   K   and   V  (  D  ) showed CV  below 6% for most of the ROIs, poorer repeatability was found in the internal capsule and corpus callosum with CV  around 10%, reflecting the challenges of dMRI in these regions due to partial volume effects with the CSF and the gray matter, Gibbs artifact, and CSF pulsation. \n  \nScan\u2013rescan repeatability of the dMRI parameters derived from DDE.

For MD and   V  (  D  ), positive correlation with age was seen in extensive regions of the white matter in both ROI-based analyses and TBSS ( \u2013 ). FA, MK,   K  , and \u03bcFA showed negative correlation with age within these regions. OP demonstrated a unique behavior in that both positive and negative correlations were observed, depending on anatomical locations. In particular, although the correlation was negative in most of the white-matter regions, positive correlation was observed in the ALIC and PLIC, external capsule, and SCR.   K   showed positive correlation with age, although in fewer regions compared with the other diffusion parameters. \n  \nCorrelation with age in the healthy control subjects.

The group differences were below the significance threshold for   K   and \u03bcFA for all ROIs. Slightly greater values of MK were observed in the patients in the PLIC and SCC. Smaller values of FA and OP were observed in the ALIC and PLIC, respectively. In TBSS, only OP revealed statistically significant results: the patients exhibited smaller values in the left internal capsule, the left cerebral peduncle, the left thalamus, and the right external capsule ( ). \n  \nDifferences between the healthy control subjects (light blue) and the patients with PD (dark blue) in the ROI-based analyses.

MK,   K  , and \u03bcFA exhibited negative correlations also in the subcortical white-matter ROIs. TBSS showed negative correlations for MK,   K  , and \u03bcFA in extensive areas in the frontal and parietal lobes and the corpus callosum, and positive correlation for   V  (  D  ) in SCC ( ).

Advanced age was associated with greater MD and smaller FA, MK,   K  , and \u03bcFA, in agreement with previous studies that used SDE ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and DDE ( ). OP decreased with age for most of the voxels, which, together with the decrease of \u03bcFA, led to the age-related decrease of FA. At the same time, a positive correlation between OP and age was observed in some white matter regions including the ALIC, PLIC, and SCR. Our results of age-related changes in \u03bcFA and OP replicated the findings by the earlier study ( ). Age-related OP increase in some regions can be understood as selective degeneration of the secondary crossing fibers, thus increasing the proportion of aligned fibers. The work by   employed a different approach than the DTD model, i.e., microscopic anisotropy estimation proposed in   which is based on the signal equation of restricted diffusion provided by  . Though it is beyond the scope of this study to examine which model should be preferred, it seems that the observed trends in age-related changes of \u03bcFA and OP are robust against this difference in model assumptions. We also found an age-related increase in the measures of size variance [  K   and   V  (  D  )]. The effects of aging and PD were in the same directions for most of the diffusion parameters and anatomical locations, such as increases of MD,   K  , and   V  (  D  ) and decreases of FA,   K  , and \u03bcFA. This is biologically plausible, because neurodegeneration in aging and PD have many features in common, including a declined ability to homeostatically regulate proteostasis, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, degeneration of the myelin sheath, accumulation of cellular debris, alteration of axonal transport, axonal swelling/beading, and loss of axons ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The present results also suggest that the measures of microscopic anisotropy (  K   and \u03bcFA) might be useful to track white-matter degeneration related to the motor impairment in PD. \n\nThrough the analysis of underlying kurtosis sources via the DTD model, we found that the reductions of MK reported in aging ( ;  ;  ) and PD ( ,  ) are likely driven by the reduction of microscopic anisotropy. The decomposition of kurtosis sources (Eq. 12) suggests that either an increase of   K   or a decrease of OP would lead to an increase of MK. We indeed observed slightly greater MK in the PLIC and SCC in the patients than in the controls. Although this appears to contradict previous reports of smaller MK in patients ( ,  ), it may instead indicate that the increase of   K   and decrease of   K   have different time trajectories during disease progression. If the increase of   K   is related to early neuroinflammation and the decrease of   K   represents the subsequent degeneration, as speculated by  , MK may possibly have a non-monotonical trajectory, with an initial increase followed by decrease, assuming constant OP (Eq. 12). Future studies to investigate the trajectories of the DTD parameters in relation to disease progression are warranted. We also demonstrated that microscopic anisotropy can be estimated with excellent repeatability comparable to that of SDE-derived DTI/DKI parameters in both the present study and the literature ( ;  ). Taken together, the present results are encouraging that multidimensional diffusion encoding could be implemented clinically. Although we used a relatively long acquisition for this exploratory study, \u03bcFA can be estimated reliably with a reduced DDE acquisition ( ;  ) to make the scan time clinically feasible. \n\nOur results support several hypothetical interpretations of previous SDE studies that relied on more restrictive assumptions. ( ) and ( ) applied regularized fitting of the bi-tensor free-water DTI model ( ) to study aging and PD, respectively. Their results showed that aging and PD are associated with an increase of the free-water fraction in the white matter. A larger free-water fraction would lead to greater size variance and smaller microscopic anisotropy ( ;  ), as observed in our study. Certainly, an increase in free water is not the only possible mechanism, and further investigation is required to elucidate specific pathological features. For example, patchy axonal loss and demyelination may lead to similar results via heterogenous increase of the radial diffusivities of compartmental diffusion tensors. Changes in axon morphology such as swelling and beading, which would reduce axial diffusivities of compartmental diffusion tensors ( ;  ) and hence \u03bcFA, also occur heterogeneously within a voxel and may lead to an increase of size variance. ( ) estimated \u03bcFA by using SDE under the assumption of uniform size and shape of compartmental diffusion tensors ( ) and reported a reduction of \u03bcFA in patients with PD and correlation with UPDRS-III score, in line with our observations. Although the methods of   and   were designed to be practical for use with clinical SDE data, the dependence on regularization or strongly restrictive assumptions may bias the output parameters ( ;  ) and therefore confirmation with extended acquisition, as we used in the current study, is important. \n\nAlthough the differences between the controls and the patients were less prominent than the effects of age, smaller OP in the patients was identified in the left cerebral peduncle and left internal capsule ( ). This overlaps the anatomical location of the medial forebrain bundle ( ), a fiber bundle that is involved early in PD ( ). Our results are in line with those of previous studies that observed reduced FA within this region ( ;  ), as well as with reports of left-predominant involvement ( ;  ). \n\nInterestingly, we observed   K   and \u03bcFA were not very sensitive to the group differences between the normal subjects and the patients with PD ( ), despite their correlation with the motor impairment. In contrast, MD,   K  , and   V  (  D  ) showed some sensitivity to the group differences in several ROIs but their correlation with motor impairment was limited to the callosal ROIs ( ). Although the mechanisms behind these observations remain unknown, our speculation is that these two groups of diffusion parameters weigh different facets of neurodegeneration. It has been hypothesized that age-related changes form pathological foundation on which PD-related neurodegeneration build ( ), and that there is a biological interaction between aging and PD ( ). We speculate that microscopic anisotropy has relatively greater weight on the accumulation of age-related neuronal damage that is perhaps accelerated in PD and exacerbates the clinical expression of symptoms, while reduced microscopic anisotropy is less specific to the diagnosis of PD. On the other hand, MD,   K  , and   V  (  D  ) may be influenced more by the factors that differentiate PD from normal aging but are not proportional to disease progression. \n\nSeveral possible confounding effects with regard to acquisition and parameter estimation need to be mentioned. First, by adopting the DTD model, which does not feature the effects of timing parameters (diffusion gradient duration, separation between the gradients, and the mixing time), we assumed the effects of timing parameters were negligible. Though this has some support by earlier studies observing the effects of diffusion time were small in brain tissue for the range above 10 ms ( ;  ), more recent studies suggest observable time-dependence in the human white matter for even longer times ( ;  ). A recent observation of intra-compartmental kurtosis in mouse brains ( ) also indicate the contribution of restricted compartments might be non-negligible. Taken together, the DTD model employed in this study may not fully capture the microstructural complexities and a more adequate model would need to feature the effects that explain the reported time-dependence, like restricted compartments ( ;  ), structural disorder ( ), or inter-compartmental exchange ( ). Incorporating the timing parameters as additional measurement dimensions of DDE is expected to identify a suitable extension of the model in future. Though dependence on the DTD model is an essential limitation to our study, in  , \u03bcFA estimated under this assumption approximated the gold-standard model-free method ( ) very well in human white matter. Therefore, we believe that any bias introduced by the model assumption was not large, at least for \u03bcFA and   K  . Second, the expansion Eq. 2 is valid only in the vicinity of   b   = 0 ( ;  ), as in the case of DTI/DKI ( ). Although the covariance tensor framework is computationally efficient, a possible bias in case of finite signal-to-noise ratio has been pointed out ( ). In addition, our scan\u2013rescan analyses revealed problematic instability of the   V  (  D  ) and   K   estimation, which needs to be addressed before clinical application of these metrics. Third, the acquisition used in this study was not controlled for the concomitant fields (transverse magnetic field components accompanying the applied gradient to satisfy Maxwell\u2019s equations) ( ), which cause bias in the signal and hence the DTD parameters ( ). This issue would be mitigated by the use of multiple refocusing pulses to make the diffusion encoding symmetric ( ). \n\nOur study has several limitations. First, PD is a heterogenous disease whose clinical manifestations vary widely among individual patients ( ). Robust determination of PD subtypes based on cross-sectional data remains a challenge ( ) and needs to be addressed in future work. Also, though we merged the left and right ROIs for this exploratory study, neurodegeneration in PD has some asymmetry which correlates with the laterality of symptoms ( ). Further investigation with a large sample will be necessary to elucidate the relationships between white-matter degeneration and detailed clinical features, including both motor and non-motor symptoms. Second, we did not prove clinical benefit of DDE as compared to the standard SDE. Though \u03bcFA showed better correlation with age and motor impairment than FA, similar correlation could be observed with MK. Given the longer scan time of DDE, DTI/DKI based on standard SDE is still a powerful option for clinical studies. However, the strength of this study is that we showed the sensitivity of MK to neurodegeneration is likely attributed to its link to microscopic anisotropy. Such knowledge can be informative for future researches in selecting dMRI acquisition and parameter to study particular diseases. Third, we applied simplistic linear models for statistical analyses, but the effects of age might differ between the patients and the controls ( ;  ). Also, the effect of PD might differ between males and females ( ). Although adding age \u00d7 disease and sex \u00d7 disease interactions in the linear model did not reveal any significant interactions for the present data (not shown), several imaging studies have suggested that these interactions are non-negligible ( ;  ). The absence of these interaction effects in the present study may be attributed to the relatively small sample size which was not optimally matched regarding male/female ratio. Fourth, the majority of patients had relatively long disease duration and were already under medication, and therefore we could not quantify the effects of medication ( ) and/or the non-linear (U-shaped) trajectories presumably related to neuronal compensation ( ). Lastly, the scan\u2013rescan repeatability should ideally be measured in a cohort similar to the patients because motion artifacts might be severer in these subjects than in young and healthy subjects. Also, the within-subject variability needs to be evaluated relative to the between-subject variability in the patients. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn this study, we explored the utility of DDE-derived parameters for characterizing white-matter degeneration in aging and PD. Advanced age was associated with greater mean size and size variance of the compartmental diffusion tensors and with smaller microscopic anisotropy. We found the reductions of MK in aging and PD reported in the literature are likely driven by the reduction of microscopic anisotropy. Furthermore, microscopic anisotropy correlated with the severity of motor impairment in PD. We further showed that microscopic anisotropy can be estimated with excellent repeatability by using modern clinical scanners. In conclusion, multidimensional diffusion encoding can provide more comprehensive and clinically relevant information about the white-matter degeneration in aging and PD than conventional SDE-based methods. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Juntendo University School Hospital.
