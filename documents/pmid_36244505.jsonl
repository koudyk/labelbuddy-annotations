Capitalizing on two different algorithms (that differ in empirical assumptions), we scrutinized the meta-analytic convergence of human neuroimaging studies investigating the neural basis of peripheral autonomic signal processing.

Remarkably, the critical regions of the CAN observed in this meta-analysis overlapped with the salience network as well as regions commonly reported across different cognitive and affective neuroimaging paradigms and regions being dysregulated across different mental and neurological disorders.
