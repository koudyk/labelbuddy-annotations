Despite this, there have been few large-scale efforts to map the full range of psychological states across the entirety of LFC. Here, we used a data-driven approach to generate a comprehensive functional-anatomical mapping of LFC from 11 406 neuroimaging studies. We identified putatively separable LFC regions on the basis of whole-brain co-activation, revealing 14 clusters organized into 3 whole-brain networks. Next, we generated functional preference profiles by using multivariate classification to identify the psychological states that best predicted activity within each cluster. We observed large functional differences between networks, suggesting brain networks support distinct modes of processing. Within each network, however, we observed relatively low functional specificity, suggesting discrete psychological states are not strongly localized to individual regions; instead, our results are consistent with the view that individual LFC regions work as part of distributed networks to give rise to flexible behavior. Collectively, our results provide a comprehensive synthesis of a diverse neuroimaging literature using relatively unbiased data-driven methods.
