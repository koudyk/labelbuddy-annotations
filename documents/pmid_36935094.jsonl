However, there are some inconsistencies in the neuroimaging studies investigating poststroke aphasia from the perspective of regional alterations. A meta-analysis has been employed to examine the common pattern of abnormal regional spontaneous brain activity in poststroke aphasia in the current study. Specifically, the Anisotropic effect-size version of seed-based d mapping was utilized, and 237 poststroke aphasia patients and 242 healthy controls (HCs) from 12 resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional ALFF, or regional homogeneity were included. The results showed that compared with HCs, patients with poststroke aphasia demonstrated increased regional spontaneous brain activity in the right insula, right postcentral gyrus, left cerebellar lobule IX, left angular gyrus, right caudate nucleus, left parahippocampal gyrus, and right supplementary motor area, and decreased regional spontaneous brain activity in the left cerebellar lobule VI, left median cingulate and paracingulate gyri, right cerebellar crus I, and left supplementary motor area. The study could provide further evidence for pathophysiological mechanism of poststroke aphasia and help find targets for treatment.
