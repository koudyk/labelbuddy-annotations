We performed a meta-analysis of task-related whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using anisotropic effect-size signed differential mapping software to compare brain activation between rMDD/MDD patients and healthy controls (HCs). We included 18 rMDD studies (458 patients and 476 HCs) and 120 MDD studies (3746 patients and 3863 HCs). The results showed that MDD and rMDD patients shared increased neural activation in the right temporal pole and right superior temporal gyrus. Several brain regions, including the right middle temporal gyrus, left inferior parietal, prefrontal cortex, left superior frontal gyrus and striatum, differed significantly between MDD and rMDD. Meta-regression analyses revealed that the percentage of females with MDD was positively associated with brain activity in the right lenticular nucleus/putamen. Our results provide valuable insights into the underlying neuropathology of brain dysfunction in MDD, developing more targeted and efficacious treatment and intervention strategies, and more importantly, providing potential neuroimaging targets for the early screening of MDD.
