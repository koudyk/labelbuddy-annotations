With now over 20 years of studies on WM, each study with tiny sample sizes, there is a need for meta-analysis to identify the brain regions consistently activated by WM tasks, and to understand the inter-study variation in those activations. However, current methods in the field cannot fully account for the spatial nature of neuroimaging meta-analysis data or the heterogeneity observed among WM studies. In this work, we propose a fully Bayesian random-effects meta-regression model based on log-Gaussian Cox processes, which can be used for meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies. An efficient MCMC scheme for posterior simulations is presented which makes use of some recent advances in parallel computing using graphics processing units (GPUs). Application of the proposed model to a real dataset provides valuable insights regarding the function of the WM.
