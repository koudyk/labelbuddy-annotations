Brain activity signals can be recorded during the alternate performance of given tasks, that is, task fMRI (tfMRI), or during resting\u2010state, that is, resting\u2010state fMRI (rsfMRI), as a measure of baseline brain activity. This contributes to the understanding of how the human brain is organized in functionally distinct subdivisions. fMRI experiments from high\u2010resolution scans provide hundred of thousands of longitudinal signals for each individual, corresponding to brain activity measurements over each voxel of the brain along the duration of the experiment. In this context, we propose novel visualization techniques for high\u2010dimensional functional data relying on depth\u2010based notions that enable computationally efficient 2\u2010dim representations of fMRI data, which elucidate sample composition, outlier presence, and individual variability. We believe that this previous step is crucial to any inferential approach willing to identify neuroscientific patterns across individuals, tasks, and brain regions. We present the proposed technique via an extensive simulation study, and demonstrate its application on a motor and language tfMRI experiment. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the benchmark neuroimaging technique for measuring brain activity, owing its advantages over other acquisition methods, such as PET or EEG. In fact, it is non\u2010invasive and does not involve radiation, which makes it safe for the subject. In addition, it provides optimal spatial and temporal resolution (finer for the spatial component). fMRI based on blood\u2010oxygen\u2010level dependent (BOLD) involves measuring the variation on oxygen consumption and blood flow that occur in brain regions in response to neural activity, which enables the identification of regions that participate in specific mental processes. Task fMRI (tfMRI) experiments are conducted by measuring brain activity in this manner for a given period of time (several minutes) while the subject is asked to repeatedly perform some task, alternating between task performance and resting periods for the entire length of the experiment. On the other hand, resting\u2010state fMRI (rsfMRI) experiments allow to record brain activity during periods of rest. These experiments are often conducted on a relatively small group of patients (approximately a hundred at most) because of cost constraints and other feasibility reasons. However, there exist recent initiatives of large multi\u2010site databases such as the UK Biobank  or the ABCD study.  In any case, the dataset obtained for each one of the subjects is significantly large, owing to the high spatial resolution of the technique. Refer to Reference   for a detailed description of this type of experiments, including tasks specification for tfMRI. \n\nThe analysis of fMRI data poses different challenges. Zhang et al  enumerate some of them in the context of an attempt to characterize task\u2010based and resting state fMRI signals. Among them, we focus on: (1) the high inter\u2010individual variability in a setting where the number of individuals is relatively small; (2) the high amount of available data for a single experiment, owing to the voxel\u2010wise structure of fMRI temporal signals; and (3) the existence of different sources of noise, from individual origins (movement during the experiment, lack of attention, etc.) to mechanical nature (scanner instability among others), that induce artifacts and undesirable measurement values in the recorded signals. \n\nIn this setting, data visualization and outlier detection tools are crucial to avoid feeding inferential algorithms with low\u2010quality data. In fact, in any context in which high\u2010dimensionality or complex data structure does not allow for the direct visual inspection of data, the application of visualization tools in low dimension and robust measures help elucidate sample composition. In particular, for functional data, of which fMRI data can be a particular case, a substantial amount of studies exist on robust visualization and outlier detection tools based on depth\u2010measures (see, for instance, References   and  ). \n\nIn functional data analysis (FDA), individual observations are real functions over a given domain, usually accounting for time, observed at discrete points. If several functions over the same domain are observed for each individual, we refer to multivariate FDA. In this setting, the number   p   of functions observed per individual is small, relative to the number   n   of individuals. Examples of this include the longitudinal patterns of flying, feeding, walking, and resting observed over the lifespan of Drosophila flies,  or the 8\u2010variate signal of electrocardiograph curves. \n\nRegarding fMRI data, multiple functions of time are observed on each individual, corresponding to the recorded brain activity on each voxel over the duration of the experiment. However, the number of dimensions is given by the number of voxels which, depending on the resolution of the scan, can be in the order of hundred of thousands, while the number of individuals is relatively small, owing to cost and time constraints. Nevertheless, the access to large multi\u2010site databases, such as UK Biobank  or ABCD study,  is increasingly common. As visual checking of data quality is particularly difficult on these large datasets, automatic pre\u2010identification of possible outliers might be of special interest here too. In any case, a new paradigm is emerging in multivariate FDA with small to moderately large   n  \nand very large   p  , which we refer to as the high\u2010dimensional functional data setting. Several proposals exist in the literature for the analysis of this type of data, based on dimensionality reduction. They primarily rely on multivariate functional principal component analysis ,   that facilitates the extraction of main features of the data for inferential purposes. In this work, we primarily consider a previous stage of analysis, focusing on data exploration and anomaly detection. \n\nThe literature on robust multivariate functional data mainly relies on the concept of depth for visualization and outlier detection. However, some very recent non\u2010depth based approaches  also address these questions. In the case of generalizing functional depth to the multivariate functional setting, two main directions have been adopted. One of the first approaches was proposed by Ieva and Paganoni  who defined a multivariate functional depth measure as a weighted sum of the functional band depths  computed over marginal functional datasets. Later, Claeskens et al  proposed a different definition comprising the integration over the time domain of any multivariate depth measure computed on the   p  \u2010dimensional sample of points observed at each time instant. Based on these definitions, several visualization tools have been proposed to enable data inspection and detection of outlying observations. On one hand, Ieva and Paganoni  extended the   outliergram   to the multivariate framework for component\u2010wise outlier detection. On the other hand, given an integrated multivariate functional depth measure or its outlyingness counterpart, several visualization tools have been defined as a two\u2010dimensional graphical representation of its average value (over the time domain) vs some measure of its variability (also over time). This allows us to distinguish typical observations (low depth/outlyingness variability over time) from magnitude (low average depth, resp. high average outlyingness) and shape (high depth/outlyingness variability) outliers. Examples of these include the   centrality\u2010stability plot   (CS\u2010plot) of Reference   and its modification proposed by Nieto\u2010Reyes and Cuesta\u2010Albertos.  Recently, two new approaches followed this same direction based on different   directional outlyingness   notions that are computationally more efficient than the existing alternatives, and proposed corresponding graphical representations, the   functional outlier map   (FOM)  and   magnitude\u2010shape plot   (MS\u2010plot).  These approaches both offer interesting results in the low\u2010dimensional multivariate functional setting. \n\nIn this study, we consider a different approach. We propose a methodology for reducing the high\u2010dimensional functional problem to a functional problem by maintaining, and not averaging, depth values over dimensions (voxels) and time. The use of computationally efficient depth\u2010based measures allows us to achieve this, even for very large   p  . The analysis of the resulting functional datasets, namely depths over dimensions and time, elucidates sample composition and outlier presence. In particular, we focus on the identification of joint outliers, because marginal outliers can be detected via standard functional data techniques applied on each dimension. A graphical 2D representation of the data, the Depthgram, is also proposed. \n\nThe remainder of this article is presented as follows. In Section\u00a0 , we discuss the taxonomy of atypical observations in multivariate and high\u2010dimensional functional datasets, and introduce the proposed depth\u2010based visualization techniques, providing the properties of the functional depth measures that form the basis for the methodology. In Section\u00a0 , we verify the performance of our visualization tools via a simulation study in the high\u2010dimensional setting, and assess its computational efficiency in comparison with existing methods for low multivariate functional data. In Section\u00a0 , we demonstrate the application of the proposed approach with a motor and language tfMRI experiment conducted on 100 individuals. Finally, we conclude the article with a discussion presented in Section\u00a0 . \n\n\n## VISUALIZATION OF HIGH\u2010DIMENSIONAL FUNCTIONAL DATA \n  \nA general setting in FDA considers that observations are i.i.d. realizations of some stochastic process  , taking values in the space of continuous functions defined from some compact real interval   into  ,  . In other words, a sample of size   n   of functional data is a collection of   n   i.i.d. continuous functions  ,  , whose realizations  ,  , are observed on a time grid of   N   points,  . We denote   as the   j  th component of the   i  th observation. If  , we are in the univariate functional data setting, where each individual has associated a curve, whereas if   we are in the multivariate functional data setting, where for each individual we observe several processes over time. In this work, we consider the case  , and refer to it as the high\u2010dimensional functional data setting. In particular, in the context of fMRI experiments,   n   is generally in the order   to  , while   p   is in the order   to  . \n\n### Outliers in multivariate and high\u2010dimensional functional data \n  \nIn FDA, outlying observations are generally classified as   magnitude outliers  , curves with values lying outside the range of the majority of the data, or   shape outliers  , curves that exhibit a shape that differs from the rest of the sample. Magnitude outliers are also referred to as   shift outliers  , and some times, the distinction between   isolated   and   persistent outliers  , is considered. Refer to References   and   for a detailed taxonomy of functional outliers. All these notions apply to a set of observed curves over the same time interval, that is, to univariate functional data. In the multivariate FDA framework, we need to consider a higher hierarchy to distinguish between   marginal   and   joint   outliers. Marginal outliers would be observations whose marginal components fall in some of the above mentioned categories, in one or several dimensions, while joint outliers would be observations with non\u2010outlying marginals, but joint outlying behavior. In fact, when thinking of fMRI data, we can imagine individuals for which brain activity patterns are standard in every voxel, with atypical relationships across brain regions. Figure\u00a0  illustrates the outlier categorization in a bivariate synthetic dataset. \n  \nBivariate functional sample where the same color is adopted to draw both components of an observation. High values in the first component tend to correspond to high values in the second component. Three outlying observations are highlighted: A marginal shape outlier in the second dimension (green), a marginal magnitude outlier in the first dimension (blue), and a joint outlier (red). For the red observation, low values in the first dimension are associated with high values in the second dimension, although none of its marginals is outlying in any of the dimensions. The magenta curve represents a central observation \n  \nTherefore, the outlier detection for multivariate functional data needs to rely on procedures that can jointly detect outliers over dimensions, and not solely marginally. The depth\u2010based methods proposed in the literature to define population depth/outlyingness measures for multivariate functional data primarily rely on two approaches (notice also the existence of some non\u2010depth\u2010based approaches ): (1) given a functional depth measure, define a multivariate functional depth measure by averaging it over dimensions, as proposed in Reference  ; and (2) given a multivariate depth measure, define a multivariate functional depth measure by integrating it over the time domain. Outlier detection methods based on depth measures or their outlyingness counterparts defined under the second approach will be able to identify joint outliers, as soon as they rely on depth (outlyingness) measures for multivariate data that are designed to do so in finite dimensional spaces. This is the case for some recent approaches, as References  ,  ,  ,  . However, in general, multivariate depth functions are computationally expensive, or even unfeasible for moderate dimension,  and efficient alternatives such as the random Tukey depth (as in Reference  ) or the   directional outlyingness   of Reference   may fail to provide a computationally efficient method in a high\u2010dimensional functional setting (refer to Section\u00a0 ). To address this situation, we propose to work with highly efficient depth notions based on the concept of band depth refer to Reference  , that apply to both functional and multivariate spaces. Moreover, instead of considering any of the two approaches described above, we embrace the   depth of depths   approach, which enables us to better characterize different types of observations and outlying behaviors. \n\n\n### Depth\u2010based tools for high\u2010dimensional functional data \n  \nWe now present some depth notions for functional data that will be incorporated into our procedure. Let us recall the modified band depth (MBD) and modified epigraph index (MEI), a depth measure and depth\u2010based index defined for the analysis of functional data in References   and  , respectively. Subsequently, their sample versions are provided. Let   be   n   continuous functions defined on a given compact real interval  . For any  , \n \nwhere   stands for the Lebesgue measure on  .   represents the average, over all possible pairs of curves, of the proportion of time that a curve spends in the band defined by any two curves in the sample.   represents the mean proportion of time that a curve lies below the curves of the sample. \n\nIn Reference  , a quadratic relationship between these two quantities was established which enabled the definition of a procedure to detect shape outliers. Indeed, in a univariate functional dataset, a curve can exhibit a low MBD value because it has an atypical shape or because it has a typical shape, but is far from the center of the bulk of curves or both. However, a curve can only obtain a high MBD value if it is   central   in both shape and location. Therefore, because the MBD of a curve is highly dependent on its location in the sample (in the sense of vertical position), and the MEI provides a measure of this location, the conditional observation of the MBD given the MEI provides an accurate shape descriptor, which allows the identification of shape outliers, that is, curves with low MBD values for relatively high MEI values. In particular it was proved that\n \nwhere   is the parabola defined by   and  ,   (notice the dependence on the sample size). The equality in ( ) holds, if and only if none of the curves in the sample cross each other. \n\nLet us introduce some notation in the context of multivariate functional data. Given a sample   of   p  \u2010variate functions observed at discrete time points, we will consider the   matrix   whose   element corresponds to the modified band depth of curve   relative to the   j  th marginal sample, that is,  . The subindex   d   of   represents dimensions, meaning that the MBD is computed on each dimension of the dataset. Indeed, the columns of   are the MBDs on each marginal. Equivalently, we will denote  , the   matrix whose columns are the MEIs on each marginal of the sample, that is,  ,  ,  . \n\nSimilarly, we will denote by  , the   matrix whose columns are the MBDs on each time point of the sample, and   (dimension  ). \n\nNow, each one of these four matrices can be understood as a set of functional observations, indexed by dimensions or time. In other words, MBD and MEI (or other depth functions) can be computed on them as will be discussed in the next section. \n\n\n### Relationship between MEI(  MBD  ) and MBD(  MEI  ) \n  \nIn a functional univariate setting, the   most central individuals   according to the modified band depth correspond to the overall highest values of   while the   most central individuals   according to the modified epigraph index correspond to the overall most central values (close to 0.5) of  , and both quantities are related by Equation\u00a0( ). \n\nWhen switching to the multivariate functional framework, one would expect that individuals that are persistently   central   over dimensions according to  , will exhibit an   curve (row) in the matrix   with higher values than most of the rest of the individuals. In contrast, individuals that are persistently far from the center of the sample across dimensions in the   sense would exhibit a low   curve (row) in the matrix  . In other words, if we apply the modified epigraph index on the   sample  , we should obtain low values for the central individuals and high values for the non\u2010central individuals. Now, if we consider the   matrix  , observations with central values across dimensions will exhibit a central curve in the matrix, while individuals whose corresponding curves take low or high values across dimensions, will tend to exhibit high and low   curves in  . Again, if we now apply the modified band depth on the   sample  , we should obtain high   values for those individuals with curves that take central values in every dimension. \n\nThis expected behavior is summarized in the following result, whose proof is provided under Supplementary Materials. \n\n \n Let   be a sample of p\u2010variate continuous functions observed at N discrete time points. If    \n ,   ,   , for all   then  \n  \n\n where   ,   , with   ,   . Moreover, if    \n ,   ,   ,   also holds, then  \n  \n\n with   as in a)  . \n \n\n \nAssumptions (a) and (b) will not hold in practice, as they require a perfectly ordered set of curves inside each dimension and across dimensions. However, Proposition\u00a0  establishes the theoretical relationship between the two measures of interest, thereby justifying their combination. \n \n\n \nThe results of Proposition\u00a0  also hold for   and   under the same assumptions (in reverse order), and the proof follows the same lines. \n \n\nThe 2D representation of   and   enable the identification of different types of observations. Refer to Figure\u00a0  for an example. Note that we adopt   and not   in the   x  \u2010axis, such that for both axes high and low values indicate   central   and   non\u2010central   observations, respectively. In this representation, the most central observations will appear in the right top corner, while the least central observations will be presented in the left bottom corner. This includes magnitude outliers, which will be found at the left bottom corner of the plot, but not necessarily isolated from the data cloud (as it is also the case in the   outliergram  ). Shape outliers will tend to appear in the left upper part of the graphic, above a bulk of the majority of sample points. \n  \nTwo\u2010dimensional representations of the bivariate sample of Figure\u00a0 . Left: Depths over dimensions. Center: Depths over time points. Right: Depths for time/correlation correction (Section\u00a0 ). The most central observation is found at the right top corner in the plots. The joint outlier is isolated in the time plot, while the shape outlier is isolated in the dimensions plot \n  \nLet us now consider the representation of   vs  . The interpretation of extreme values in both axes is similar to the previous one; however, in this case joint outliers function as shape outliers. Certainly, joint outliers are observations that have an association pattern across dimensions (shape when the functional data is considered as a function of dimensions for a fixed time point) that differs from that of the majority of the observations. \n\nIn fact, this only holds if the association across dimensions is positive, that is, the ordering of the curves is preserved from one dimension to the next one. Otherwise, the identification of an observation whose components exhibit a different association behavior is not straightforward, as illustrated in Figure\u00a0 . Note that in this case, we consider   as a functional observation, and we apply functional depth tools on it. In such a setting, multivariate depth tools would be more beneficial in detecting joint outliers at each time point. Another complex situation is the case where an observation exhibits a clear association pattern across its components, and the rest of the observations are independent dimension\u2010wise. However, in this case, conventional multivariate depths applied marginally on the observations for each time point will also fail. This is illustrated in Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nFirst row: A bivariate functional dataset with reversed curve ordering between the two dimensions. Second row: Bivariate observations for   and  , represented using a parallel coordinate plot (the choice of time points is arbitrary and is adopted for illustration). Third row: DepthGrams. The same color is used across the figures to identify individual observations. The observation coded in red is a joint outlier, because low values in the first dimension are associated with low values in the second dimension, where the opposite holds for the rest of the curves in the sample. Because there are changes in the sign of the correlation among dimensions, the third Depthgram version is most suitable for identifying joint outliers \n    \nFirst row: A three\u2010variate functional dataset with independent components. Second row: DepthGrams. The same color is used across the figures to identify individual observations. The observation depicted in red could be considered as a joint outlier, because low values in the first dimension are associated with low values in the second and third dimensions, while the rest of the curves behave independently across dimensions. The same is true for the blue observation, which, in addition, is a magnitude outlier in the first dimension. There is a spurious negative correlation between the second and third components of the dataset; hence, the time/correlation Depthgram differs from the time Depthgram. However, because no clear correlation pattern is present in the sample, both exhibit the same dispersed appearance \n  \n\n### DepthGrams \n  \nWe propose three graphical representations of the data based on the relationships between   of   and   of   as already detailed. On one hand, the DepthGram on dimensions, where functional depths are first computed on the sample of curves   observed over  , for each  , and the DepthGram on time, where functional depths are first computed on the sample of   p  \u2010dimensional observations  , for each time point  . On the other hand, the   time/correlation   DepthGram, which is just the time DepthGram on a modified dataset, to   correct   for negative association across dimensions.\n   \nDimensions DepthGram: Scatter plot of points  ,  . \n  \nTime DepthGram: Scatter plot of points  ,  . \n  \nTime/Correlation DepthGram: Scatter plot of points  ,  , with  ,  , where   denotes Pearson's correlation coefficient function. \n  \n\nThe motivation for this third representation is the possible presence of negative association between some of the dimensions, as illustrated in Figure\u00a0 . The underlying idea is to define a new sample   with the same structure on the marginals and positive association between dimensions. This association is quantified as the linear correlation between curve ranks (in terms of  ). Certainly, at each dimension   j  ,  ,   is equal to  , except for a possible change in sign that reverses the order of the curves. The procedure starts at  , where for  ,   is defined as   if the correlation between   and   is negative, and   otherwise. For  ,  , if the correlation between   and   is negative, and   otherwise. Accordingly, because the relative shape and position of the curves are preserved inside each component of the sample, depths computed marginally on each dimension (those used to build the Dimension DepthGram) would be the same. However, because the transformed sample   has a positive association pattern along dimensions, the time DepthGram computed on it will differ from that built on   because at any time point, multivariate observations will tend to have a more regular behavior for most of the observations, and joint outliers will stand out in the parallel coordinate representation of these multivariate samples. \n\nUnlike other existing tools based on outlyingness measures, the DepthGram representations are bounded in both horizontal (  of  s) and vertical (  of  s) axes, which eases interpretation. In fact, it is not just a tool for the visual identification of outliers, but also for the two\u2010dimensional representation of the entire sample, which also allows us to visualize central individuals and sample variability on time and dimensions. Although the result of Proposition\u00a0  establishes the conceptual basis for the definition of an outlier detection rule, as atypical observations will tend to lie above the parabola  , the determination of a threshold for this rule requires the approximation of the distribution of the distances to the parabola, which is unfeasible in the high\u2010dimensional setting considered in this study (refer to Section\u00a0  for an approximate non\u2010optimized detection rule). However, the fact that scales are fixed on both axes of the DepthGram plots and that outliers are associated with particular values in these two\u2010dimensional representations enables the visual identification of outliers. This is demonstrated in Section\u00a0 . \n\n\n\n## SIMULATION STUDY \n  \nNow, we evaluate the performance of our procedure via simulations in two different contexts: high and low\u2010dimensional functional settings. \n\nThe simulation settings are as follows: we fix   and  , then we consider four different generating models described below, and for each model, different values of the dimension of the data:   in the high\u2010dimensional case and   in the low\u2010dimensional case. Then, we consider five   outlyingness intensity values  ,  . We generate 200 datasets under each of these configurations. The level of contamination/outlyingness is defined as follows: for every dataset, we fix the number of outliers to 15, with 5 magnitude outliers, 5 shape outliers, and 5 joint outliers. The parameter   c   represents the proportion of dimensions in which the outlying curves are indeed outliers: for  , there are no outlying curves in the sample; for  ,   of the curves are outliers in every dimension (  of each type); and for  ,   of the curves have outlying marginals in   of the dimensions. The dimensions in which these curves actually behave as outliers are selected randomly and independently for the different curves. \n\nThe objective of this simulation design is to provide different outlying behavior settings, focusing on joint outliers. In fact, for each simulation model described below, the magnitude and shape outliers behave as expected in univariate functional outlier detection problems  and can be considered marginally on each dimension. However, the pattern for joint outliers differs in each of the four models. In Models 1 and 3, there is positive association across dimensions, that is, individual values are persistently high or low across dimensions. Therefore, a joint outlier in this context would be an individual for which high (resp. low) values in some dimensions are not necessarily associated with high (resp. low) values in the remaining dimensions. In Model 1, the ranks (relative positions among curves) of joint outliers vary randomly across dimensions. In Model 3, the ranks of joint outliers always alternate between top and bottom positions, that is, a high average value in one dimension is always followed by a low average value in the next one. Note that the outlying pattern for joint outliers in Model 1 is not as evident as that of Model 3. In fact, in Model 3, every joint outlier curve presents negative association between consecutive dimensions (as opposed to the general pattern of positive association between all variables), while for Model 1, this is not necessarily the case. Models 2 and 4, in addition to having a different mean process, represent the opposite situation with respect to association patterns across dimensions: the association pattern between consecutive dimensions is negative for the entire sample, except for joint outliers. In Model 2 (as in Model 1), the ranks of joint outliers vary randomly across dimensions, whereas in Model 4 the association pattern across dimensions of joint outliers is always positive. Similarly to Models 1 and 3, the outlying behavior of joint outliers in Model 4 is more pronounced than that of Model 2. These two models represent situations in which the Time/Correlation Depthgram will typically provide results that differ from the Time Depthgram. \n\nNow, the general structure for the four models is the following: the   j  th component,  , of the   i  th observation,   is given by \n \nwhere   and   are independent realizations of a Gaussian process with zero mean and covariance function  . In other words, the general model is a functional concurrent model or varying\u2010coefficient model on each dimension from a reference dataset   and with coefficient function   for the   j  th dimension. Subsequently, magnitude outliers are shifted upwards, shape outliers are generated with the same model but from a different reference set  , and joint outliers are generated with the same model, but applied for each dimension on a different reference curve  , where   is selected depending on the particular model.\n   \n Model 1:   Let   and \n \nwhere   are independent and identically distributed and let \n \n  \n\nFor each pair of joint outlying observation/component  ,   is randomly selected on the index subset of the non\u2010outlying observations. In other words, the   j  th component of the   i  th observation is linearly related to the realization of the reference process on a randomly chosen individual  , instead of being related to  . This provides a method for introducing joint outliers that are not shape or magnitude marginal outliers in any dimension. In addition, shape outliers are neither joint or magnitude outliers in the way they are generated, nor magnitude outliers are shape or joint outliers. This may help provide insight on how each different type of outlier is identified.\n   \n Model 2:   Let   and \n \nwhere   are independent and identically distributed, and let\n \nModel 2 replicates Model 1, but with negative correlation in the ordering of the curves between odd and even dimensions. \n  \n Model 3:   Everything is set as in Model 1 except for  , which is defined such that joint outliers exhibit an association pattern across dimensions that is the opposite to the general pattern. In this model, indexes   i   for joint outliers are randomly chosen among the observations with lowest (for approximately half of them) and highest (for the other half) reference curves (in terms of the   values), that is,  . Then, for   i   a joint outlying observation with  ,\n \nwhere   denotes the integer part and   represents the ordered   sample. \n  \n Model 4:   This model is the same as Model 2, but with   as defined in Model 3. \n  \n\n### High\u2010dimensional setting \n  \nFor this setting, we consider   and 50\u2009000. In this context, we do not compare the performance of the Depthgram to competing methods, because to the best of our knowledge, they are restricted to low\u2010dimensional settings. Refer to Section\u00a0 \nfor a comparative study in this context. \n\nFigure\u00a0  presents sample datasets generated under the four models for  . Because the visualization tool proposed in this article does not provide an outlier detection rule, we do not summarize performance using rates of false and correctly identified outliers. Instead, we attempt to demonstrate that over different models and random replicates, the Depthgram on its three variants behaves expectedly, that is, isolating different types of outliers on different areas of the Depthgram plot. Accordingly, for each simulation setting, we ran the Depthgram on each synthetic dataset and then represented all the   points from all datasets together (for each Depthgram type,  ). This works as a summary Depthgram plot in which 2D density contours are plotted according to the frequency of points in the plot area. The density contours are colored according to the type of observation they correspond to (non\u2010outlying, or any of the three kinds of outliers), such that we can visually assess whether the procedure works at separating outlying from non\u2010outlying observations, and the different types of outliers between them. As an illustration of this representation, Figure\u00a0  presents the results obtained with Model 1 for  . The corresponding figures for Models 2 to 4 with  , and for all four models with  , can be found under Supplementary Materials. \n  \nSample datasets of the four models and selected dimensions ( ,  ). Each model is represented in a row, with row   i   corresponding to the   i  th model. Outliers are represented according to the following color code: Magnitude, shape, and joint outliers are displayed in blue, red, and purple shades, respectively. Two non\u2010outlying curves are presented in black with solid and dashed lines to help visualize how the relative ordering between curves changes across dimensions, which can also be observed by monitoring the changes in position of magnitude and shape outliers marginals. In Models 1 and 3, the ordering is preserved across dimensions while in Models 2 and 4 the ordering is reversed in odd and even dimensions. In Models 1 and 2, the relative ordering of joint outliers across dimensions is random, while in Models 3 and 4, it follows a pattern opposite to that of the rest of the sample \n    \nSummary of 200 simulation runs under Model 1, with  , and different outlyingness values   c  . Summary Depthgrams are obtained as the density contours of mbd(epi) and 1\u2010epi(mbd) points over the 200 simulated datasets. The colors represent outlier classification (including non\u2010outlying observations) \n  \nThese summary graphical representations indicate that as the outlyingness intensity   c  \ndecreases, all the observations (outliers of different types and the rest of the sample) are mixed together, which is expected, as   c   represents the proportion of dimensions in which candidate outlying curves are actually simulated to present an outlying behavior. However, even for  , we can already find some separation between different classes of observations. Notice that in Models 2 and 4, magnitude outliers also behave as joint outliers (because they persistently exhibit average high values in every dimension, instead of alternating between high and low values); hence, it is not surprising to find them close together in the Time Depthgrams. In addition, notice how joint outliers are better distinguished when comparing Model 3 to Model 1 and Model 4 to Model 2 (especially true for lower values of   c  ). In general, magnitude outliers are the most difficult to identify (except when they also behave as joint outliers), because even if they are always found at the left bottom corner of the Dimensions Depthgram, no separation may exist at all between them and the rest of the typical observations. In fact, this is true in this setting, for which the order of the curves is optimally preserved among dimensions. In other situations, non\u2010outlying observations would have average ranks over dimensions significantly smaller than magnitude outliers, and the separation would be more evident. However, the detection of magnitude and shape outliers is more of a marginal problem. In addition to the DepthGram analysis, marginal outlier detection for univariate functional data has been conducted on each dataset using conventional methods. Details on this procedure and the results obtained are provided under Supplementary Materials (Table 1). \n\n\n### Low\u2010dimensional setting \n  \nTo set a reference with respect to existing methods, we compare the Depthgram with the   functional outlier map   (FOM), ,   and the   magnitude\u2010shape plot   (MS\u2010plot)  as a tool for outlier detection. \n\nThe FOM is a 2D graphical representation that can be used with any functional (integrated) depth or outlyingness measure. It displays the functional depth of each observation (obtained as aggregation of multivariate depths over the observation domain) vs a measure of variability of the multivariate depth values for each time point. Here, we consider the FOM adopted with the   functional directional outlyingness (fDO)   as introduced in Reference  , for which an outlier detection rule is defined based on the distribution of the Euclidean distances of the FOM points to the origin, after scaling. \n\nThe MS\u2010plot adopts an alternative definition of   directional outlyingness   that assigns a   p  \u2010dimensional (directional) outlyingness vector to a functional   p  \u2010variate observation. The MS\u2010plot maps the multivariate functional data to multivariate points by representing each observation with its mean directional outlyingness vector and a measure of its variability. When  , the graphical representation can be performed by simply representing the norm of the mean outlyingness vector vs its variability. The outlier detection rule relies on the approximate distribution of the robust Mahalanobis distances of the  \u2010dimensional points in the MS\u2010plot. \n\nBoth outlier detection procedures are designed for low\u2010dimensional settings. The multivariate outlyingness measure leading to fDO in FOM is calculated using an approximate algorithm that relies on the assumption  . The MS\u2010plot can be obtained for any value of   p  ; however, the associated outlier detection rule, in particular, the approximation of the distribution of the robust Mahalanobis distance, requires  . Hence, we restrict this simulation study to   and  , keeping all other settings from the high\u2010dimensional case. \n\nThe two alternative methods considered bear an important computational burden as   p   increases, because they rely on the computation of   p  \u2010variate outlyingness measures, over each point of the observation domain. To reduce this burden, we propose an alternative way to apply these outlier detection techniques, by considering the synthetic functional multivariate datasets as functional univariate datasets defined on a multivariate domain. In other words, for each individual   i  , its observed   p  \u2010variate function  ,  , can be regarded as a surface or volume  ,  , where   D   is a continuous domain, for which in practice, the process is only observed at   p   discretized points. From a practical perspective it implies that univariate functions are stacked together. Handling the data in this manner, the multivariate structure that may help detecting joint outliers is missed. However, we expect to identify this type of outliers as shape outliers in the new functional univariate dataset. Notice that for the Depthgram, both approaches are equivalent and yield the same results. In fact, the depth\u2010related quantities involved in the construction of the Depthgram are computed over the   grid of all the dimensions and observation points. \n\nTo establish a direct comparison in terms of detection rates, we adopt the following empirical outlier detection rule for the Depthgrams: the set of outlying observations in depthgram   is  , where  ,  , and   and   denote the sample third quartile and interquartile range, respectively. The global set of outlying observations is defined as  . The factor   F   is set to 1.5, similar to the classical boxplot rule. For this procedure, which is inspired by Proposition\u00a0 , to yield accurate results, we would need a data\u2010driven estimation approach to approximate   F  , similar to the adjusted outliergram.  However, this will require us to approximate the distribution of  ,  , which is unfeasible in a high\u2010dimensional setting, and is beyond the scope of this article. Here, the objective is to provide a simple rule to conduct the comparative analysis. Notice that the graphical summaries that have been used in the high\u2010dimensional simulation study to visually assess the performance of the Depthgram cannot be adopted with the other two methods because the quantities represented in the FOM and MS\u2010plot are the mean and dispersion of outlyingness values, which are not bounded and might even exhibit very different ranges across simulation runs. \n\nIn Figures\u00a0  and  , we present the five graphical tools for two different simulation runs with   from Models 1 and 2, respectively. We can find similar graphical representations for Models 3 and 4, under Supplementary Materials. In all simulation runs, outliers are coded as observations 86 to 100: labels 86 to 90 (blue shades in the figures) correspond to magnitude outliers, 91 to 95 (pink/red shades in the figures) correspond to shape outliers, and labels 96 to 100 represent joint outliers (purple shades in the figures). Tables 2 and 3 under Supplementary Materials contain the proportion of correctly and falsely identified outliers by each one of the methods, over the 200 simulation runs for the four models and different values of   p  . Accordingly, we can draw the following conclusions. The Depthgram behaviors for both   are very similar to the one observed in a high\u2010dimensional setting, with slightly better detection rates for  : shape outliers are detected by the Time Depthgram, joint outliers are detected by the Time/Correlation Depthgram and magnitude outliers are only detected when they are also joint outliers (Models 2 and 4 with negative association among components). In general, FOM exhibits a low detection rate, with better performance in the lower dimension case ( ) and in its   p  \u2010dimensional version, except for magnitude outliers, which are also captured in its  \u2010dimensional version. For the MS\u2010plot, detection rates are generally very high, with better performance for   in its   p  \u2010dimensional version and for   in its  \u2010dimensional version. For this configuration ( , MS\u2010plot 1\u2010dim), the method exhibits full detection capacity in models with positive association among components (Models 1 and 3). However, for Models 2 and 4, there is a high false positive detection rate (around  ) and low sensitivity for shape (both models) and joint outliers (Model 2). The Depthgram exhibits the best overall detection performance for joint outliers. Regarding the   p  \u2010dimensional versions of FOM and MS\u2010plot, the drop, as   c   reaches the value 1, of the proportion of correctly detected magnitude (both) and shape outliers (only for FOM) is worth noting. This might be owing to the fact that for  , all 15 potential outliers consistently act as outliers in every dimension, which increases the contamination level on the   p  \u2010dimensional spaces associated to each time point (where multivariate outlyingness measures are applied). \n  \nResults for a single simulation run under Model 1, with  , and  . In the top row we present the three DepthGram representations. In the bottom row, we present the FOM and the MS\u2010plot in their   p  \u2010dimensional and 1\u2010dimensional versions. Except for the   p  \u2010dimensional MS\u2010plot, the boundary dividing the outlying and non\u2010outlying observations is drawn (a dashed line for the DepthGram and FOM and a solid ellipse for the MS\u2010plot). In all the plots, detected outliers are marked with a bullet while the rest of the observations are represented with an empty circle. True outliers are represented in color (blue for magnitude outliers, pink/red for shape outliers and purple for joint outliers) while non\u2010outlying observations are drawn in gray \n    \nResults for a single simulation run under Model 2, with  , and  . In the top row we present the three DepthGram representations. In the bottom row, we present the FOM and the MS\u2010plot in their   p  \u2010dimensional and 1\u2010dimensional versions.

True outliers are represented in color (blue for magnitude outliers, pink/red for shape outliers and purple for joint outliers) while non\u2010outlying observations are drawn in gray \n  \nAs we have mentioned in the previous section, marginal (shape and magnitude) outliers can be detected very efficiently with univariate functional detection methods. Moreover, these have the advantage, over multivariate methods, of identifying the components in which the outlying behavior happens. Thus, multivariate methods should focus on the detection of joint outliers, which, as we have seen, might be difficult in the presence of different types of outlying observations and, especially, negative association among dimensions. This can be explained by the fact that for methods based on the functional one\u2010dimensional representation, negative association becomes shape variability among the curves, and the higher the variability in the sample, the more difficult it is to detect outlying curves. However, for the original versions of FOM and MS\u2010plot, the underlying multivariate outlyingness measures are significantly influenced by the presence of other types of outliers. \n\nAnother point for comparison is the computational complexity of the different methods. DepthGram is a very efficient procedure because it is based on the computations of MBD and MEI, which solely requires the ranking of observations at any time point and dimension. The outlyingness measures adopted for the FOM and MS\u2010plot representations are heavier from a computational perspective, and even in their one\u2010dimensional configuration, in which they are computed over samples of real numbers at every time point and dimension, the computation times are significantly higher than those of DepthGram (refer to Supplementary Materials for details). \n\n\n\n## tFMRI DATA EXPLORATION \n  \nIn this section, we analyze two tfMRI experiments conducted on the same   healthy individuals (the analysis of two other tasks on the same individuals is included under Supplementary Materials). Data (T1\u2010weighted, T1w, and two tfMRI) were obtained from the HCP database ( ), which are comprehensively described in Reference  . Only the tfMRI acquired during two different functional tasks were selected for this study. The first stack of tfMRIs were acquired during a motor task where some visual cues requested the participants to either tap their left or right fingers. The second acquisition was performed during a language task where different stories or arithmetic operations were presented to the participants via an audio record, and after having listened to them, they were asked a question about what they heard, and two possible answers were offered to be selected by pushing a button. Task and resting periods were alternated during a total duration of   and 316 seconds for the motor and language experiments, respectively. \n\nTogether with the native T1w and tfMRI images, HCP provided the minimal preprocessed images,  which includes the tfMRI images spatially registered to a stereotactic space (MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute). These normalized images (  voxels of 2 mm isotropic resolution) were the images used in this study. A binary image (1 = brain, 0 = background) defined in the MNI space was employed to select 192\u2009631 voxels. \n\nThe final datasets are thus composed by the brain activity records of   subjects on   points of the brain over   and   seconds. The objective of the analysis is to help visualize this high\u2010dimensional functional dataset and to detect individuals with central and outlying brain activity patterns. As an example, Figure\u00a0  presents the brain signals over time in 6 selected voxels for the motor experiment. Four individuals are highlighted to help visualize alterations in signal shape and in association patterns across dimensions (voxels). \n  \nBrain activity over time of   individuals in 6 of the   voxels for the motor experiment. The signals of individuals 20, 39, 66, and 89 are highlighted. These are some of the individuals identified as potential outliers, except for individual 66 who exhibits the most central pattern (Figure\u00a0 ). They illustrate different signal shapes and different association patterns across voxels. For instance, individual 20 presents negative association between voxels 48, 80, 31 (top right) and 68, 74, 34 (bottom right) while this association is positive for the other three individuals \n  \nDepthgrams for the motor experiment are illustrated in Figure\u00a0 . The time Depthgram is significantly spread on both dimensions, which implies that mixing/crossing of individual signals exist across dimensions (voxels). When considering the time/correlation Depthgram, point coordinates differ; however, the global structure remains the same. This heterogeneity across voxels does not follow a structured pattern, and is rather the result of independent components. This might be owing to the fact that only very specific regions of the brain are involved, and are expected to be activated in the motor task. Hence, the signals of the voxels outside of these regions act as noise in this experiment, thereby inducing this independence pattern across voxels. \n  \nDepthGrams for the motor experiment \n  \nIn Figure\u00a0 , we present the same views, but this time for the language experiment. Here, we can observe how the time and time/correlation Depthgrams follow the same unstructured pattern as in the motor experiment, because, again, the regions involved in the language task represent a small part of the entire brain. \n  \nDepthGrams for the language experiment \n  \nRegarding outlier detection, let us first point out that the analyzed dataset meets quality standards in the field because clinical diagnosis for several mental conditions were considered to exclude subjects from the experiment, and standard fMRI techniques for artifact removal had been applied as a preprocessing step. Moreover, due to the general independence of signals across voxels, we cannot expect to find any joint outlier, as explained in Section\u00a0 . Indeed, if there is no common association pattern across voxels shared by a majority of individuals, deviances from it cannot be observed (refer to the Supplementary Materials for different results on two additional task datasets). Nevertheless, the Depthgrams have enabled the identification of some outlying patients. In the motor experiment, individual 39 is located in the north\u2010west area of the voxel Depthgram as a potential shape outlier. After the posterior examination, this subject happens to have moved more than permissible during the experiment, and thus should have been discarded from the sample. The same is observed with subject 84 in the language experiment, that would be classified as a magnitude outlier. This different consideration of the outlier type in these two cases, which tend to share the same source of noise, might be owing to the different nature of the task performed in each experiment and the interference of motion. Moreover, individual 81, which appears to be a magnitude outlier in the language experiment, has been demonstrated, by a posterior examination, to suffer a mild form of schizophrenia that had not been diagnosed. Additionally, marginal outlier detection has been applied voxel\u2010wise. The results for both experiments indicate that all individuals exhibit a magnitude and/or shape outlying behavior in at least some hundreds of dimensions, out of a total of 192\u2009631 voxels. However, if we just consider individuals with an outlying behavior in a large number of voxels, the results are consistent with those potential shape and magnitude outliers identified with the Depthgrams. \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThis study proposed the Depthgram as a tool for representing high\u2010dimensional functional observations on a plane. Unlike current approaches for multivariate functional depth based on aggregation over dimensions or time of suitable functional or multivariate depth measures, the proposed methodology relies on the   depth of depths  . In fact, the variables that define the two\u2010dimensional representation of the data are depth measures/indexes on the datasets obtained by computing depth over dimensions or time domain. This approach enables the identification of different types of outliers in different parts of the plot, including joint outliers. It is computationally efficient in the high\u2010dimensional setting, and unlike procedures relying on outlyingness measures, it also facilitates a global overview of the sample composition. The methodology relies on the theoretical relationship between two different   depth of depths   measures. The result allows establishing the most likely regions for typical and atypical observations. However, it does not provide an outlying detection rule because the distribution of the distance to the theoretical boundary for typical and atypical observations is unknown and cannot be feasibly approximated in the high\u2010dimensional setting. Nevertheless, an empirical detection rule can be adopted by setting a cutoff value for point distances to the boundary. \n\nThere are three versions of the Depthgram: dimensions, time and time/correlation depthgrams. They are designed to be used together because they provide complementary information. The first version is the most useful at identifying shape and magnitude outliers. The time Depthgram aims at identifying joint outliers, that is, observations that are not marginal outliers in any of the dimensions, but exhibit a dependency pattern among dimensions that differs from the rest of the sample. The time/correlation Depthgram is designed to do the same in situations where the general association pattern among dimensions is highly variable and the time Depthgram fails to provide a structured representation of the sample. In fact, the comparison of the time and time/correlation depthgrams elucidates the association patterns across dimensions, where the association in this case is understood as linear correlation among the curve ranks given by the modified epigraph index. In general, for the three Depthgrams, the more similar and smooth the curves, and the more regular the association pattern in the sample, the more structured the Depthgram representations. In other words, we can also better understand the regularity or homogeneity of the sample by the spread of the Depthgrams representations. \n\nFinally, we suggest the combination of the Depthgram with specific tools for the detection of marginal outliers across the different univariate functional samples. Certainly, the challenge with a high\u2010dimensional functional setting, and which cannot be achieved with existing tools for univariate functional data is the ability to detect atypical joint behavior. If marginal outliers are present in the sample, not only is it more efficient to adopt specific methods marginally, but it is also more beneficial to identify the dimensions in which the observation exhibits an outlying behavior than just classifying the entire observation as an outlier. Accordingly, we recommend the use of the functional boxplot  and the outliergram,  as they rely on the same depth tools than the Depthgram and can be computed simultaneously and efficiently. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9305951, "text_md5": "3ce5611168e12942ac7b6c24242e59df", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 93], "journal": [94, 102], "publication_year": [104, 108], "title": [119, 228], "keywords": [242, 334], "abstract": [347, 1659], "body": [1668, 57491], "tables": [57504, 57504]}, "batch": 19, "pmid": 35118686, "doi": "10.1002/sim.9342", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9305951", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9305951"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9305951\">9305951</a>", "list_title": "PMC9305951  Depthgram: Visualizing outliers in high\u2010dimensional functional data with application to fMRI data exploration"}

Nigral hyperintensity from nigrosome-1 and striatal dopamine transporter uptake are reduced in Parkinsonism; however, quantification is only possible with SPECT. Here, we aimed to develop a deep-learning-based regressor model that can predict striatal  I-FP-CIT uptake on nigrosome magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a biomarker for Parkinsonism. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nBetween February 2017 and December 2018, participants who underwent 3\u00a0T brain MRI including SWI and  I-FP-CIT SPECT based on suspected Parkinsonism were included. Two neuroradiologists evaluated the nigral hyperintensity and annotated the centroids of nigrosome-1 structures. We used a convolutional neural network-based regression model to predict striatal specific binding ratios (SBRs) measured via SPECT using the cropped nigrosome images. The correlation between measured and predicted SBRs was evaluated. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe included 367 participants (203 women (55.3%); age, 69.0\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2 [range, 39\u201388] years). Random data from 293 participants (80%) were used for training. In the test set (74 participants [20%]), the measured and predicted  I-FP-CIT SBRs were significantly lower with the loss of nigral hyperintensity (2.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.85 vs. 2.44\u2009\u00b1\u20090.90) than with intact nigral hyperintensity (4.16\u2009\u00b1\u20091.24 vs. 4.21\u2009\u00b1\u20091.35,   P  \u2009<\u20090.01). The sorted measured  I-FP-CIT SBRs and the corresponding predicted values were significantly and positively correlated (\u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.7443; 95% confidence interval, 0.6216\u20130.8314;   P  \u2009<\u20090.01). \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nA deep learning-based regressor model effectively predicted striatal  I-FP-CIT SBRs based on nigrosome MRI with high correlation using manually-measured values, enabling nigrosome MRI as a biomarker for nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration in Parkinsonism. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00234-023-03168-z. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe main pathologic process underlying Parkinsonism, including Parkinson\u2019s disease and multiple system atrophy, is \u03b1-synuclein-mediated nigrostriatal dopaminergic cell loss and iron overload in the substantia nigra (SN) of the midbrain [ ]. The dopaminergic cell loss in the SN occurs in structures called nigrosomes, which are three-dimensional (3D) organizations of calbindin-poor zones within calbindin-rich neuropils of the nigral complex [ ,  ]. \n\nThe recent development of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), primarily susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), has enabled the direct visualization of the nigral structures in the SN [ \u2013 ]. The normal nigrosome appearance, showing hyperintensity between the hypointense areas of the SN, can be lost in idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy, and even in premotor disease, such as isolated rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder, which can support the clinical diagnosis of the diseases [ \u2013 ]. However, although Parkinsonism is a \u201cprogressive\u201d neurodegenerative disease, the detection of nigral hyperintensity on SWI is a matter of \u201cpresence or absence,\u201d which precludes the quantification of the nigrosome status, limiting the ability of SWI to monitor disease severity or progression. Contrarily, dopamine transporter (DaT) imaging, such as  I-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane single-photon emission computerized tomography ( I-FP-CIT SPECT), can provide information regarding nigrostriatal function based on quantified DaT uptake in the striatum; thus, it can diagnose Parkinsonism and monitor the disease [ ,  ]. However, compared with MRI, interpretation of SPECT does not depend on absolute change but on comparing the counts between normal and abnormal regions; in addition, SPECT is associated with the risk of radiation exposure. \n\nA few studies have focused on the agreement between SWI and  I-FP-CIT SPECT [ ,  ]. If the loss of nigral hyperintensity on SWI also progresses over time in correlation with the reduction in striatal DaT uptake on SPECT, we should be able to model the relationship between nigral imaging and SPECT to predict nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration on easily accessible MRI. \n\nIn this study, we aimed to develop a deep-learning-based regressor model that can predict striatal DaT uptake on nigrosome MRI, assessing the feasibility of deep learning for the quantitative interpretation of nigrosome imaging in the clinical setting for Parkinsonism. The purpose of this study was to correlate 3\u00a0T SWI with the manually measured  I-FP-CIT in the continuous domain, instead of dividing the degree space into normal and abnormal subranges, to create MRI biomarkers for Parkinsonism correlated with nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis prospective case-control study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our institution. It was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. \n\n### Study participants \n  \nConsecutive patients who visited the movement disorder center in our referral institution between February 2017 and December 2018 were eligible for the study. All were clinically assessed by a neurologist with 22\u00a0years of experience in movement disorders. Those who had suspected parkinsonian symptoms were enrolled if they underwent 3\u00a0T brain MRI examination including SWI and concurrent  I-FP-CIT SPECT. Those who exhibited severe motion artifacts on MRI, especially SWI, and who demonstrated vascular ischemia in the striatum and/or occipital cortex on MRI, which could lead to false-positive results in the calculation of specific binding ratios (SBRs) on  I-FP-CIT SPECT, were excluded. The clinical diagnosis of each participant was made in accordance with the established criteria as follows: idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease [ ], multiple system atrophy [ ], progressive supranuclear palsy [ ], isolated rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder [ ], drug-induced Parkinsonism [ ], essential tremor [ ], vascular pseudo-Parkinsonism [ ], cerebellar ataxia [ ], Fahr\u2019s syndrome [ ], and normal pressure hydrocephalus [ ]. \n\n\n### MRI protocol \n  \nMRI was performed using a 3\u00a0T MRI scanner (Ingenia and Ingenia CX; Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) with a 32-channel SENSE head coil. SWI was obtained using an imaging plane perpendicular to the midbrain. Imaging parameters for SWI were as follows: 3D multi-echo fast-field-echo sequence; repetition time, 88\u00a0ms; total echoes, 5; first echo time, 10\u00a0ms; echo interval, 10\u00a0ms; flip angle, 10\u00b0; field-of-view, 192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192 mm ; voxel size, 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091 mm ; 30 slices; scan time, approximately 4\u00a0min. Based on SWI acquisition, susceptibility map-weighted imaging (SMWI) was generated from the multi-echo fast-field-echo complex images to improve the visibility of the nigrosome structures [ ]. Post-processing was performed using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) according to a previously described method [ ]. The first step was to generate magnitude images using multi-channel magnitude images. After correcting the phase offset of the individual channels, the phase images were combined as a complex mean. Next, the magnitude images at each of the five echoes were combined into a single image using the root sum of squares. Phase images at different echo times were unwrapped using the Laplacian algorithm, and the combined frequency was calculated for each voxel. Then, the background field was removed from the frequency images, and quantified susceptibility mapping was performed using the improved sparse linear equation and least-squares method [ ]. A quantified susceptibility mapping mask was generated from the quantified susceptibility mapping for susceptibility contrast weighting. Finally, an SMWI was produced by multiplying the multi-echo combined magnitude images with the quantified susceptibility mapping mask. The reconstruction slice thickness of SMWI was set at 1\u00a0mm. \n\n\n### I-FP-CIT SPECT protocol \n  \nThe participants were orally administered 6\u00a0mL of Lugol's solution before the  I-FP-CIT injection. Scans were performed 3\u00a0h after the intravenous injection of 185\u00a0MBq of  I-FP-CIT (DATrace-123\u2122, Samyoung Unitech, Seoul, Korea) with a triple-headed rotating gamma camera system (Trionix XLT; Trionix Research Laboratory, Inc., Twinsburg, OH, USA) with low-energy, ultra-resolution, parallel hole collimators. Scans were acquired in 40 steps spanning 120\u00b0, with 40\u00a0s per step, via the step-and-shoot method. Images were reconstructed using filtered back projection with a Butterworth filter (cutoff frequency, 0.4 cycle/cm; order, 13), and attenuation correction using Chang's method (coefficient of 0.12/cm). First, a nuclear medicine physician with 17\u00a0years of experience visually interpreted the  I-FP-CIT SPECT results. The reader was blinded to the clinical data and the MRI findings at the time of interpretation. The decision regarding the SPECT results for the diagnosis was based on visual inspection. For the quantification analysis, images were analyzed with a dedicated software program (DATquant, Xeleris 3.1, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Volumes-of-interest were defined automatically with DATquant, regarding the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen), caudate nucleus, putamen, and occipital cortex. The SBRs of the striatal regions were calculated as follows: (mean counts in striatal regions \u2013 mean counts in the occipital cortex) / (mean counts in the occipital cortex). The averaged value was used for further analysis. \n\n\n### MRI analysis \n  \nTwo board-certified neuroradiologists (with 11 and 21\u00a0years of experience, respectively) independently evaluated the bilateral nigral hyperintensities on SMWI followed by resolving discrepancies by consensus. Normal nigral hyperintensity was defined as a focal linear or oval hyperintense area in the dorsolateral aspect of the SN surrounded by hypointensity [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\n\n### Deep regressor model \n  \nTwo neuroradiologists annotated the centroids of the nigrosome-1 structures on SMWI in consensus to crop a region-of-interest (ROI) with a fixed voxel size of 50\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009\u00d7\u200920, which sufficiently covered the entire nigrosome-1 structure on each side. These crops were used for the deep-learning-based regression analysis. \n\nA convolutional neural network-based regression model was used to predict the target SBR because convolutional neural networks are widely used for learning discriminative image features. Specifically, we used the Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-style convolutional neural network (CNN) in our regression network (Fig.\u00a0 ). Following the original order of the VGG layers, we used 3D convolutional blocks because the input nigrosome patch is a small 3D volume.   \nDeep regressor network.\u00a0Three convolutional blocks were used, each with two convolutional layers (Conv) with a trailing max-pooling layer (Pool), to extract high-level feature maps. The feature map of the last convolutional block was flattened and passed through fully connected layers to predict a striatal SBR.\u00a0SBR, specific binding ratio; SMWI, susceptibility map-weighted imaging \n  \n\nThe network architecture followed a pattern similar to the VGG network where a stack of convolutional blocks first extracts high-level features from the input image, then a block of fully connected layers generates the final prediction from the extracted features. The configuration of the convolutional blocks (e.g., number and kernel size of the convolutional layers, type of the pooling layer) was also identical to the original VGG network. Nonetheless, the total number of convolutional blocks was reduced to three because of the small input size. Technical CNN architecture is described in  . \n\nThe regressor was trained using the L2-loss as the objective function, the mean squared error between the model predictions and the corresponding true SBRs on SPECT. The training was aimed to minimize the mean squared error. A learning rate of 1e\u2009\u2212\u20094 was used. \n\nThough U-net [ ] is a commonly used convolutional network for neuroimage analysis, U-net generates spatial output (e.g., segmentation) by adding a decoder block after the usual CNN encoder, which is not suitable for our task. In our method, our target SBR output is a single score assigned per patch, which is similar to the structure of the usual CNN output (e.g. class-probabilities, scalar values, etc.). Among the usual CNNs, VGG has been widely used in general medical image analysis [ ]. Recent CNN architectures (e.g. ResNet [ ]) have also been adopted in different medical image analysis tasks lately. However, VGG network with its simpler structure still remains a powerful tool under the small medical dataset. In our experiment, we also employed ResNet convolutional blocks for SBR prediction, which resulted in a poorer performance compared to the VGG blocks. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nBased on a single side, loss of nigral hyperintensity on SMWI was compared with the ipsilateral abnormal visual result on  I-FP-CIT SPECT using the chi-square test, and the concordance rate was calculated. Next, striatal  I-FP-CIT SBRs were compared according to the ipsilateral nigral hyperintensity status on SMWI. After training the deep regressor model, the predicted single-side striatal  I-FP-CIT SBRs from the deep regressor model were also compared according to the status of nigral hyperintensity. The continuous predictions and  I-FP-CIT SPECT SBRs were compared using residual analysis in terms of the absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. Normalized residuals were also computed after dividing the exact residuals by the SBR interval: the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the SBRs, as observed on  I-FP-CIT SPECT. Lin\u2019s correlation coefficient (\u03c1 ) was computed to determine the agreement of the predicted SBRs with the actual SBRs on  I-FP-CIT SPECT in the continuous domain. The 95% confidence interval (CI) of the correlation was computed using Fisher\u2019s transform. Statistical significance was set at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (version 25.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and MedCalc for Windows (version 17.9; MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Clinical characteristics of the included participants \n  \nThis study included 367 participants (sex, 203 women and 164 men; age, 69.0\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2 [range, 39\u201388] years). The clinical diagnoses of the participants included idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease (  n\u2009=  \u2009287), multiple system atrophy (  n\u2009=  \u200917), progressive supranuclear palsy (  n\u2009=  \u200914), isolated rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (  n\u2009=  \u20099), drug-induced Parkinsonism (  n\u2009=  \u20093), essential tremor (  n\u2009=  \u200914), vascular pseudo-Parkinsonism (  n\u2009=  \u200912), cerebellar ataxia (  n\u2009=  \u20094; including two cases of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6), Fahr\u2019s syndrome (  n\u2009=  \u20091), normal pressure hydrocephalus (  n\u2009=  \u20094), and healthy participants (  n\u2009=  \u20092). \n\n\n### Relationship between SMWI and  I-FP-CIT-SPECT findings \n  \nOf the 367 participants, 293 showed loss of nigral hyperintensity on SMWI and 308 showed abnormal visual results on  I-FP-CIT SPECT, with a concordance rate of 95.4% (Table  ). Among them, one participant diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease showed loss of nigral hyperintensity on SMWI but normal finding on  I-FP-CIT SPECT, presumably due to the mild decrease in striatal DaT uptake which resulted in a visually normal appearance. In addition, 16 participants showed intact nigral hyperintensity on SMWI but abnormal finding on  I-FP-CIT SPECT, including idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease (  n\u2009=  \u200912), multiple system atrophy (  n\u2009=  \u20091), vascular pseudo-Parkinsonism (  n\u2009=  \u20092), and Fahr\u2019s syndrome (  n\u2009=  \u20091). The measured  I-FP-CIT SBR of participants with intact nigral hyperintensity on SMWI was significantly lower than that of participants with intact nigral hyperintensity (2.36\u2009\u00b1\u20090.86 vs. 4.31\u2009\u00b1\u20091.11,   P  \u2009<\u20090.01).   \nSMWI and  I-FP-CIT SPECT findings in all study participants \n  \nValues are presented as n (%) \n\nSMWI, susceptibility map-weighted imaging;  I-FP-CIT SPECT,  I-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane single-photon emission computed tomography \n  \n\n\n### Correlation of deep regressor-predicted and measured  I-FP-CIT SBRs \n  \nRandomly-selected data from 293 participants (80%) were used for training the deep regressor model, and 74 participants (20%) were used for the test set (Table  ). In the test set, the predicted  I-FP-CIT SBRs were significantly lower in the participants with loss of nigral hyperintensity on SMWI than in those with intact nigral hyperintensity.   \nSMWI and  I-FP-CIT SPECT findings in the test set \n  \nValues are presented as n (%) or as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation \n\nSMWI, susceptibility map-weighted imaging;  I-FP-CIT SPECT,  I-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane single-photon emission computed tomography; SBR, specific binding ratio \n  \n\nThe sorted measured  I-FP-CIT SBRs and the corresponding prediction values showed a significant positive correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.7443 (95% CI, 0.6216\u20130.8314;   P  \u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a0 ). The average distance between the predicted and measured SBRs was 0.6837\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5972 (95% CI, 0.5467\u20130.8207) with a median of 0.4727. The average distance obtained for using the ResNet convolution blocks was 0.9206\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7569 (95% CI, 0.7482\u20131.0931), which was significantly poorer than using the proposed VGG blocks (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05). The root-mean-square error of the proposed regression model was 0.9078 (95% CI, 0.7183\u20131.0641). Considering the observed range of the measured  I-FP-CIT SBR, the deep regressor showed a mean normalized error of 10.68\u2009\u00b1\u20099.39% (95% CI, 8.54%\u201312.82%), with a median error of 7.39%.   \nPlot of the predicted striatal SBRs against the sorted measured SBRs evaluated on  I-FP-CIT SPECT.\u00a0The predictions showed a good correlation of 0.744 with the SPECT evaluation.\u00a0 I-FP-CIT SPECT,  I-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane single-photon emission computed tomography; SBR, specific binding ratio \n  \n\n\n### Activation map \n  \nThe analysis of activation maps is useful for interpreting the explicability of a deep learning model. Activation maps highlight regions of attention for prediction. Figure\u00a0  shows the activation maps for two examples (one with low SBR and one with high SBR). High attention regions highlighting the nigrosome were observed in each of these examples.   \nAttention map examples for low striatal I-FP-CIT SBR (top) and high SBR (bottom).\u00a0The leftmost images represent two examples of SMWI input.

The attention map is illustrated using the color map above, and an additional opacity channel, where high opacity is used for high-attention regions and low opacity is used for low-attention regions.\u00a0 I-FP-CIT,  I-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane; SBR, specific binding ratio \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we demonstrated that a deep learning regressor model based on nigrosome MRI could effectively predict striatal DaT uptake on SPECT. The results of the human-based assessment of the loss of nigral hyperintensity on 3\u00a0T SMWI and the abnormal nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration on SPECT were significantly correlated, and the manually measured  I-FP-CIT SBRs were significantly lower with the loss of nigral hyperintensity. After training the deep-learning regressor model, it could predict  I-FP-CIT SBRs based on 3\u00a0T SMWI, and the predicted values were significantly correlated with the established ground truth that was manually measured, with a correlation coefficient of 0.744. Therefore, we propose that deep learning-based analysis of non-invasive 3\u00a0T nigrosome MRI could determine the striatal DaT uptake levels in patients with Parkinsonism. \n\nPresynaptic dopaminergic scans, such as  I-FP-CIT SPECT, are more sensitive indicators of Parkinsonism than clinical examinations as they detect nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration [ ]. DaT imaging quantifies the degree of nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration by measuring DaT uptake in the striatum, which is an effective tool to diagnose Parkinsonism and monitor disease progression [ ]. However, current DaT imaging techniques are accompanied by ionizing radiation exposure, which makes repeated examinations in a single patient along with the disease progression clinically challenging. Its accessibility is limited compared to MRI, as the examination can be invasive due to the radiotracer injection, and its cost is relatively high. \n\nWith high-resolution MRI, the nigral structures of nigrosomes have been successfully visualized on 3\u00a0T SMWI, and their loss has been a strong diagnostic indicator of Parkinsonism. This was a breakthrough in the imaging-based diagnosis of Parkinsonism since 3\u00a0T SMWI can be applied in patients without any risk of radiation exposure and can be repeated as many times as clinically needed. Thus, the loss of nigral hyperintensity on MRI may correspond to dopaminergic denervation on DaT imaging. Striatal  I-FP-CIT uptake can be significantly lower with the loss of nigral hyperintensity on SWI than with intact nigral hyperintensity [ ,  ,  ,  ]. In addition, decreased striatal DaT uptake might precede the loss of nigral hyperintensity in a sequential process [ ,  ]. Accordingly, 16 participants in our study showed abnormal  I-FP-CIT SPECT finding but intact nigral hyperintensity on SMWI as previously reported [ ,  ]. One study previously showed a large overlap between SBRs of participants with intact and non-intact nigral hyperintensities [ ]. Another study also determined the quantified  I-FP-CIT uptake level based on the nigral hyperintensity status on 3\u00a0T SMWI, where the nigrosome signal is lost when striatal  I-FP-CIT SBRs drop below certain thresholds [ ]. When nigrosomes appear morphologically normal but striatal DaT uptake slightly decreased, the MRI findings may be falsely negative for early Parkinson\u2019s disease. Therefore, imaging-based diagnosis of Parkinsonism solely based on MRI can be misleading, and DaT imaging is necessary for a definitive diagnosis. \n\nNigral hyperintensity in patients with Parkinsonism may progressively decrease along with striatal DaT uptake during the disease process. However, the human eye cannot detect the partial loss of nigral hyperintensity before its total loss; thus, it can only provide a qualitative assessment, capturing either the presence or absence of nigral hyperintensity. Consequently, the demand has increased for quantifying nigral hyperintensity and determining its correlation with striatal DaT uptake for disease monitoring using SWI by adopting a deep learning-based approach. However, a recent study utilizing CNN for the deep learning-based assessment of the SN on SWI could only determine the presence or absence of nigrosome-1 but not provide any quantitative data possibly correlating with DaT imaging [ ]. For the deep learning-based evaluation of the nigral SMWI prediction of SBRs, our choices for the analytic method could be either segmentation-based or regression-based estimation. The segmentation-based method can provide interpretable results if the segmentation result is visible; however, it necessitates a dedicated post-processing step, and the derived results of segmentation are a mere intermediate step to the estimation of SBRs, not an end product. However, regression-based estimation permits the direct estimation of the parameter of interest using a segmentation-free regression network, and with deep learning, it can provide more accurate end-to-end results [ ]. Therefore, in our study, we chose regression-based estimation over segmentation-based estimation to predict SBRs using SMWI. \n\nOur deep learning-based regressor model can quantitatively predict striatal DaT uptake based on 3\u00a0T SMWI in patients with Parkinsonism. The degree of decrease in striatal DaT uptake can be predicted using nigrosome MRI, making non-invasive 3\u00a0T SMWI both a diagnostic indicator and disease monitoring tool for Parkinsonism. Notably, the high attention regions on the attention maps were correlated with the regions of presenting nigral hyperintensity from the nigrosome-1; therefore, we can assume that the degree of the remaining nigral hyperintensity on SMWI was primarily used for the network to predict striatal DaT uptake. Until recently, the quantitative assessment of Parkinsonism using MRI has mainly focused on the use of neuromelanin MRI, rather than nigrosome MRI. The area and contrast ratio of T1 high-signal neuromelanin pigmentation in the SN decreased in patients with Parkinsonism [ ], in correlation with striatal DaT uptake [ \u2013 ]. The area of T1 high-signal neuromelanin-rich SN is easier to segment and measure than the more irregular and smaller shape of nigral hyperintensity, leading to several deep learning-based analyses of the neuromelanin-rich SN in Parkinsonism and the prodromal phase [ \u2013 ]. Nigrosome MRI can be utilized to diagnose Parkinsonism based on the loss of nigral hyperintensity, but the quantitative correlation between nigral hyperintensity and DaT uptake cannot be performed, while the decrease in the area and the signal of the neuromelanin-rich area can be quantitatively correlated with DaT uptake but is difficult to utilize for the individual diagnosis of Parkinsonism [ ]. However, as our current study has provided a quantitative analysis of SMWI-based nigrosome imaging in correlation with DaT uptake using a deep learning-based regressor model, the overall role of MRI in assessing Parkinsonism can be expanded by covering individual diagnosis, quantification, and correlation with DaT imaging, and even monitoring disease progression. \n\nOur study had some limitations. First, as we enrolled participants with concomitant examinations of 3\u00a0T SWI and  I-FP-CIT SPECT, those included were mainly diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease, whereas the number of disease control participants was unavoidably small. The number of participants in the training set was unevenly distributed among disease categories. Second, as the number of patients with isolated rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder was relatively small, we could not analyze the diagnostic performance for the prodromal phase separately, and the potential strength of our regressor model in predicting phenoconversion from premotor disease could not be determined. Future studies should focus on the use of our regressor model in patients with prodromal diseases. Third, as this study was performed in a single institution, our study results could not be externally validated. It was difficult to find an external dataset that included simultaneous 3\u00a0T SMWI and  I-FP-CIT SPECT images, as in our study design. Although our results demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based regressor correlating nigrosome MRI with striatal DaT imaging, further validation using external cohorts is needed. To generalize our results, variable nigrosome MRI obtained from different scanners and sites should be used for further validation. Therefore, future multicenter studies are needed to set up optimized imaging protocols for nigral MRI. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur proposed deep learning-based regressor model effectively showed that nigrosome MRI findings could be correlated with striatal DaT uptake on SPECT in the continuous domain. It could predict striatal  I-FP-CIT SBRs with a high correlation with manually measured values based on 3\u00a0T SMWI. Deep learning-based regressors may help in overcoming the current limitation of nigrosome MRI and become a potential biomarker for Parkinsonism, predicting disease severity and progression. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tIntact nigral hyperintensity on SMWI(n\u2009=\u200974)\tLoss of nigral hyperintensity on SMWI(n\u2009=\u2009293)\tP-value\nNormal visual finding on 123I-FP-CIT SPECT(n\u2009=\u200959)\t58/74 (78.4%)\t1/293 (0.3%)\t\nAbnormal visual finding on 123I-FP-CIT SPECT(n\u2009=\u2009308)\t16/74 (21.6%)\t292/293 (99.7%)\t\n\t\t\t<\u20090.01\n### Caption\nSMWI and 123I-FP-CIT SPECT findings in all study participants\n### Footer\nValues are presented as n (%)SMWI, susceptibility map-weighted imaging; 123I-FP-CIT SPECT, 123I-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane single-photon emission computed tomography\n\n\n## ID: Tab2\n### Label: Table 2\nUnnamed: 0\tIntact nigral hyperintensity on SMWI(n\u2009=\u200919)\tLoss of nigral hyperintensity on SMWI(n\u2009=\u200955)\tP-value\nNormal visual finding on 123I-FP-CIT SPECT(n\u2009=\u200916)\t16/19 (84.2%)\t0/55 (0%)\t\nAbnormal visual finding on 123I-FP-CIT SPECT(n\u2009=\u200958)\t3/19 (15.8%)\t55/55 (100%)\t<\u20090.01\nMeasured 123I-FP-CIT SBR\t4.16\u2009\u00b1\u20091.24\t2.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.85\t<\u20090.01\nDeep regressor-predicted 123I-FP-CIT SBR\t4.21\u2009\u00b1\u20091.35\t2.44\u2009\u00b1\u20090.90\t<\u20090.01\n### Caption\nSMWI and 123I-FP-CIT SPECT findings in the test set\n### Footer\nValues are presented as n (%) or as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviationSMWI, susceptibility map-weighted imaging; 123I-FP-CIT SPECT, 123I-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane single-photon emission computed tomography; SBR, specific binding ratio\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10271910, "text_md5": "c6df30625d1177b1e77356a9be594972", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 160], "journal": [161, 175], "publication_year": [177, 181], "title": [192, 330], "keywords": [344, 445], "abstract": [458, 2645], "body": [2654, 28806], "tables": [28819, 30194]}, "batch": 19, "pmid": 37209181, "doi": "10.1007/s00234-023-03168-z", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10271910", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10271910"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10271910\">10271910</a>", "list_title": "PMC10271910  Deep learning regressor model based on nigrosome MRI in Parkinson syndrome effectively predicts striatal dopamine transporter-SPECT uptake"}

Healthy right-handed subjects (12 men, 12 women) were investigated with 3T-fMRI during synonym generation. Behavioral performance and sex hormone levels were assessed. Women were examined during the early follicular and midluteal cycle phase. The activation pattern in all groups involved left frontal and temporal as well as bilateral medial frontal, cingulate, occipital, basal ganglia, and cerebellar regions. Men showed greater left frontal activation than women in both menstrual cycle phases. Women yielded high correlations of left prefrontal activation with estradiol in the midluteal phase and with progesterone in both phases. Testosterone levels correlated highly with left prefrontal activation in all three groups. In all, we describe a cerebral network involved in semantic processing and demonstrate that it is significantly affected by gender and sex steroid hormones. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSemantic retrieval is a memory process involving word meaning. It entails several cognitive processes such as perceiving a target word, holding it online in working memory, retrieving its meaning, activating related concepts and, depending on the task at hand, actively searching for concepts with equivalent meaning. To date, semantic retrieval has primarily been investigated in the context of word-fluency or category-fluency tasks, in which subjects have to produce a list of members of a category. Functional imaging investigations on semantic fluency tasks emphasize the role of the left inferior frontal and premotor cortex in a network including cingulate gyrus, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (Audenaert et al.  ; Basho et al.  ; Gourovitch et al.  ; Hirshorn and Thompson-Schill  ; Klein et al.  ; Nyberg et al.  ). \n\nSemantic processing has often been related to gender or hormonal influences, however the results are heterogeneous. Behavioral studies yielded variable results on the influence of gender in semantic tasks. Some authors reported higher verbal performance in women (Kimura and Clarke  ; Weiss et al.  ; Wirth et al.  ) while others could not detect differences (Roberts and Bell  ). Likewise, the influence of menstrual cycle (Gordon and Lee  ; Rode et al.  ) and sex steroid hormones is controversially discussed (Carlson and Sherwin  ; Roberts and Bell  ; Thilers et al.  ; Yonker et al.  ). Using functional imaging, some investigators observed physiological correlates of gender differences in semantic processing, e.g. higher activation in women than men (Baxter et al.  ; Jaeger et al.  ; Ragland et al.  ) or vice versa (Bell et al.  ; Buckner et al.  ; Gizewski et al.  ; Rossell et al.  ) (for details see \u201c \u201d). Others were unable to confirm these findings (Gur et al.  ; Halari et al.  ,  ; Schlosser et al.  ; Sommer et al.  ; Weiss et al.  ). Some of these controversies on gender differences may relate to effects of sex steroid hormones and menstrual cycle, which are not taken into consideration in most imaging studies. While one functional imaging study failed to find hormonal influences on a rhyming decision with word pairs (Veltman et al.  ), Fernandez et al. demonstrated hormone-, task-, and region-specific variations across the menstrual cycle in women performing a semantic decision task. Women in the midluteal phase showed higher activation compared to women in the perimenstrual phase (Fernandez et al.  ). This is in agreement with Dietrich et al. who described a more global influence of cycle phase on magnitude and extent of activations during word-stem-completion with the most pronounced signal increases in the midluteal phase (Dietrich et al.  ). Influences of gender, menstrual cycle, and sex steroid hormones are not restricted to semantic functions, though. Our group recently reported sex differences in a spatial working-memory task that were related to testosterone and estrogen levels. Men showed stronger activation than women in the left inferior parietal lobe, left fusiform gyrus and lingual gyrus. Testosterone correlated with brain activation in men and women in the low estrogen phase, while estrogen showed large correlations with brain activation in both women groups, indicating that sex hormones might indeed contribute to fMRI variability in cognitive tasks (Sch\u00f6ning et al.  ). \n\nIn the present study, we apply a synonym generation task requiring silent retrieval of as many synonyms as possible while striving for high synonym quality, emphasizing the semantic challenge of the task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study taking into account the influences of gender, menstrual cycle phases, and sex hormone levels on activation patterns in fMRI during semantic retrieval. The main objective of this study is to characterize cerebral networks during synonym generation. In addition, we hypothesize that brain activation patterns are influenced by gender, phases of the female menstrual cycle, and serum levels of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. Based on previous findings, we conjecture that women outperform men and show higher levels of brain activation. We also expect higher activations in the midluteal than in the perimenstrual phase. To explore if sex steroid hormones exert an independent effect, hormone levels will be correlated with brain activation within each group separately. \n\n\n## Material and methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nThirty-four healthy, right-handed, heterosexual German subjects (age-range 23\u201345 years) participated in the study after giving their informed consent. The study was approved by the local Institutional Ethical Review Board and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Men were examined once, women twice in pseudo-randomized order\u2014once 1\u20133 days after onset of menses (early follicular phase) and once in the midluteal phase adjusted for cycle length (individual cycle length \u22127 days with a range of \u00b12 days). Only pre-menopausal women with stable cycle length were included and any form of hormonal treatment was excluded. The phase of the menstrual cycle was confirmed by sex steroid hormone analysis (for details see below). None of the subjects had a history of a serious medical disease, or any neurological or psychiatric illness. Twelve females and 12 males were included in the final analysis (for details see Table\u00a0 ).   \nSubjects baseline characterization and task performance (mean \u00b1 SD) \n  \n T   tests between groups are not significant if not indicated otherwise.  Value differs significantly from value in other groups \n\n For women during the early follicular phase and women during the midluteal phase versus men   P   < 0.001 \n\nFor women during the early follicular phase versus men   P   = 0.008. For women during the midluteal phase versus men   P   < 0.001 and versus women during the early follicular phase   P   < 0.001 \n\nFor women during the midluteal phase versus men   P   < 0.001 and versus women during the early follicular phase   P   < 0.001 \n  \n\nReasons of exclusion were either technical or to achieve homogeneity of the hormonal status and cycle phase. A second fMRI scan could not be obtained for two women. In six female participants, the sex steroid hormone analysis revealed values not corresponding to the target phase of their menstrual cycle that was expected from their menstrual history (four anovulatory cycles, two cycles with high progesterone levels in the presumed early follicular phase). Two males were excluded because of unusually low or high testosterone levels. \n\nIntelligence was assessed using CFT 20 (Weiss  ) and MWT-B (Lehrl et al.  ), two German standard short measures for estimating intelligence quotients based on visuo-spatial and verbal material, respectively. There were no significant differences between men and women for age or intelligence measures (see Table\u00a0 ). All participants had more than 12 years of education. Handedness was assessed by the Edinburgh handedness inventory (Oldfield  ). \n\n\n### Sex steroid hormone assessment \n  \nBefore fMRI scanning, a venous blood sample was drawn to determine total testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This was always done between 2 and 5 pm in order to minimize known day-time variation (Chappell  ; Davison and Bell  ). Men were excluded from further analysis if serum testosterone levels were below 2.3 ng/ml and above 8 ng/ml. Women were diagnosed as being in the early follicular phase of menstrual cycle if onset of menstrual bleeding had started and if serum estradiol and progesterone levels were \u226470 pg/ml and <1 ng/ml, respectively. They were categorized as being in the midluteal phase of menstrual cycle if onset of menstrual bleeding had occurred at individual cycle length minus 7 days (\u00b12 days) prior to the examination. All included women had estradiol levels \u226566 pg/ml and progesterone levels \u22654 ng/ml. FSH and LH levels were within the normal range of premenopausal women in all female subjects (FSH < 15 IU/L, LH < 20 IU/L). All hormone analyses were performed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays (ECLIA, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany, as described in  ). \n\n\n### Experimental design \n  \nDuring fMRI scanning, five synonym generation condition blocks (  S  ) were administered, each consisting of 30 s task performance, followed by a 30 s rest period (  R  ), according to an   S  \u2013  R  \u2013  S  \u2013  R  \u2013  S  \u2013  R  \u2013  S  \u2013  R  \u2013  S  \u2013  R   design. Synonym generation is considered a task that reflects both semantic retrieval and verbal fluency. During each block, two German adjectives were presented using Presentation Software\u00ae (Version 0.81, 2004, Neurobehavioral Systems Inc., Albany, CA, USA) on an MR compatible back-projection screen. Word frequency of adjectives was balanced between blocks (Celex Lexical Database for German, Release 2, Version 2.5, cf. (Baayen et al.  )). Subjects were instructed to silently retrieve as many synonyms as possible until the appearance of a new word or until a fixation cross indicated the beginning of the rest period. The instruction further urged subjects to strive for quality of the synonyms. These data were obtained as part of a larger protocol. Women were tested twice, receiving two equivalent versions of the synonym retrieval task in a counter-balanced order in their early follicular and midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Each of the versions was randomly administered to 50% of the men. \n\nSynonym retrieval was performed again after fMRI scanning, with subjects speaking aloud to obtain behavioral measures. Adjectives were presented on a computer screen and responses were recorded. This post-scanning synonym task was performed on the ten previously seen adjectives, aiming to probe performance in the scanner (  reproduction condition  ). Subjects were also tested on seven new adjectives to test the de novo generation of synonyms (  novel generation condition  ). \n\n\n### Analysis of behavioral data \n  \nTwo types of analyses were performed on the behavioral responses to assess quantity and quality of the retrieved synonyms. Total word count served as global   quantity score  . A synonym   quality score   was obtained by categorizing responses according to their status as (near) synonyms. This was done by checking their occurrence in two synonym dictionaries (M\u00fcller  ; Wahrig  ). Quality-to-quantity ratios indicate the proportion of synonyms relative to the total of produced words. Thus, the following performance measures were established: a Quantity score, a Quality score, a Quality\u2013quantity-ratio both for the reproduction and the novel generation conditions (see Table\u00a0 ). Differences between men and the women in both phases were assessed using unpaired   t   tests, while differences between women as a function of menstrual cycle were tested using paired   t   test. \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nMRI data were acquired in a 3 T whole body scanner (Intera T30, Philips, Best, NL) equipped with master gradients (nominal gradient strength 30 mT/m, maximal slew rate 150 mT/m per millisecond). A circularly polarized transmit/receive birdcage head coil with a HF reflecting screen at the cranial end was used for spin excitation and resonance signal acquisition. Functional images were acquired using a T  weighted single shot echo-planar (EPI) sequence (whole brain coverage, TE = 50 ms, TR = 3,000 ms, flip angle 90\u00b0, slice thickness 3.6 mm without gap, matrix 64 \u00d7 64, FOV 230 mm, in-plane resolution 3.6 \u00d7 3.6 mm). Thirty-six transversal slices orientated parallel to the AC\u2013PC line were taken. \n\n\n### MRI data analysis \n  \nFunctional MRI data were analyzed using SPM2 standard routines and templates ( ). To allow for saturation effects of the BOLD signal, the first ten images of each session (30 s pre-stimulus interval) were discarded. The remaining images were realigned, normalized and resliced to a voxel size of 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm , and smoothed with a 9 mm kernel. Data were then filtered with a high-pass filter (cut-off period of 128 s). BOLD-responses for synonym generation were modeled using a boxcar function convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function employed by SPM2. To obtain activation maps across subjects, the functional data were combined in a random-effects analysis to identify brain areas activated during synonym generation. In a first level fixed-effects analysis, we obtained one statistical parametric map (SPM) and corresponding contrast images for each subject, reflecting the contrasts of interest. These individual contrast images were entered into a second-level random-effects analysis to determine activations at a group level. The second-level analysis consisted of three steps:   \n Step 1  : Within-group activation patterns were assessed by one sample   t   tests in a random-effects analysis. The alpha error was set to   P   < 0.05 corrected (false discovery rate) and the contiguity threshold to \u226520 voxels. To allow comparability with other studies, in particular to assure independence from sample sizes,   T   values were converted into Cohen\u2019s   d   effect sizes according to Cohen\u2019s   (Cohen  ; Kline  ), using the vbm2 toolbox provided by C. Gaser, University of Jena, Germany ( ).   T   and   d   values were overlaid on a single-subject template provided in MRIcron (Rorden et al.  ). Anatomical localizations of activated brain regions were identified using the MSU toolbox based on the Talairach daemon (Lancaster et al.  ). \n  \n Step 2  : Differences between groups were calculated within the regions that showed activation in the group results (step 1), using an ANOVA model. The alpha error was set to   P   < 0.001 uncorrected and the contiguity threshold to \u226520 voxels. To assure comparability across studies, differences are reported as   T   and Cohen\u2019s   d   values and were overlaid on a single-subject template provided in MRIcron (see above). \n  \n Step 3  : The correlation of brain activation with hormone levels for estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone was investigated in areas activated in the group results (from step 1). Simple regression (correlation) analysis was performed for testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone. For descriptive analysis, unthresholded   T   values were converted into correlation coefficients r using the cg_t2x.m script provided by C. Gaser, University of Jena, Germany ( ). The corresponding   P   values were determined from   r   values using the online calculator for scientists at Graphpad Software ( , degrees of freedom = 10). Correlation coefficients (and equivalent   P   values) were overlaid on a single-subject template provided in MRIcron (Rorden et al.  ). \n  \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Task performance \n  \nThere were no significant differences between males and females in both phases of the menstrual cycle in any of the post hoc performance measures. Small differences between means, such as higher scores for men during word reproduction, or higher scores for midluteal women during novel word generation, were within the range of the SD. During the reproduction condition, subjects produced an average word quantity of 48.9 \u00b1 20.2 words, of which only 9.8 \u00b1 3.3 words met the criteria for synonym quality, corresponding to a Quality\u2013quantity-ratio of 0.23 \u00b1 0.12. During the novel generation condition, the average number of words generated to novel target adjectives was 43.3 \u00b1 16.9 with 5.7 \u00b1 2.0 synonyms, corresponding to a Quality\u2013quantity-ratio of 0.16 \u00b1 0.10 (for details see Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Within-group activation patterns during synonym generation \n  \nThe synonym retrieval task led to prominently left lateralized prefrontal activation. Both men and women showed extensive activations on the lateral surface of the frontal cortex, comprising the left inferior and middle frontal gyri, the precentral gyrus, and the right inferior frontal gyrus. On the medial surface of the hemispheres, bilateral activation of superior and medial frontal gyrus (supplementary motor area, SMA) and the anterior cingulate gyrus were noted. Another consistent pattern of activation was observed in the middle occipital gyrus and lingual gyrus, as expected due to the baseline visual and reading components of the task. In addition, parts of the basal ganglia and cerebellum were active bilaterally (for details see Fig.\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0 ).   \nBrain activation during synonym generation in women during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, women during the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and men.

The difference between men and women in their early follicular phase was larger (cluster size 155 voxels) than the difference between men and women in their midluteal phase (cluster size 63 voxels). Women showed a trend towards higher activation of prefrontal regions when in their midluteal phase, which did not reach statistical significance (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nDifferences in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation in (  a  ) men compared to women during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, and (  b  ) men compared to women during the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle.

Estradiol correlated only weakly with left prefrontal activation when women were in the early follicular phase (  r   < 0.3,   P   = 0.343) and in men (  r   < 0.2,   P   = 0.533). \n\nProgesterone showed high correlations with left prefrontal activation in women both in the early follicular (  r   = 0.6,   P   = 0.039) and the midluteal phase (  r   = 0.7,   P   = 0.011), while correlations in men were weak (  r   < 0.2,   P   = 0.533). \n\nTestosterone values were strongly correlated with left prefrontal activation in all three groups, that is men (  r   = 0.6,   P   = 0.039), women in their early follicular phase (  r   = 0.5,   P   = 0.098), and women in their midluteal phase (  r   = 0.7,   P   = 0.011). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe main objective of this study was the characterization of cerebral networks during synonym generation. We also hypothesized that brain activation patterns are influenced by gender, phases of the female menstrual cycle, and serum levels of sex steroid hormones. We observed activation of the classical language and memory areas. In the absence of behavioral differences, men showed higher brain activation in left frontal language areas than women. Women showed a trend towards higher activation in the midluteal phase. The correlation of brain activation with sex hormone levels was different between groups and across the menstrual cycle. \n\n### Within-group activation patterns during synonym generation \n  \nSynonym generation has rarely been investigated using functional imaging techniques, while word generation, word and category fluency tasks have been investigated more often. Left lateralized activation of the frontal cortex, including precentral, inferior, and middle frontal gyri is characteristic for word generation (Klein et al.  ; Nyberg et al.  ). Left frontal areas are also active when words are semantically associated (Buckner et al.  ; Chee et al.  ; Chou et al.  ,  ; Gabrieli et al.  ; Price  ; Woodward et al.  ), or when words are pronounced silently (Bookheimer  ; Borowsky et al.  ; Huang et al.  ). SMA and cingulate gyrus are involved in word generation and semantic retrieval (Etard et al.  ; Papathanassiou et al.  ). The anterior inferior temporal gyrus has been associated with lexical retrieval (Brunswick et al.  ), and the left posterior middle temporal lobe with semantic processing, such as the association of objects on the basis of their meaning (Chou et al.  ; Price  ; Woodward et al.  ). Cerebellar activation has previously been reported in silent speech generation and synonym generation as well (Jansen et al.  ; Klein et al.  ; Nyberg et al.  ). The synonym generation paradigm, thus far only used sparsely in combination with functional imaging techniques, provides stable patterns of brain activation with predominant activation of left prefrontal language regions. \n\n\n### Gender effects during synonym generation \n  \nIn accordance with our hypothesis, we observed gender-related differences in the degree of brain activation in the key left frontal language areas. The difference in activation between men and women was most pronounced in the left middle frontal and precentral gyri. It was most pronounced when men were compared to women during the early follicular phase of their cycle. The gender differences reported here cannot be attributed to differences in verbal performance in our fMRI subject sample, as behavioral performance did not significantly differ between groups on any measure. Buckner and colleagues reported a PET study in which brain activation during verb generation was larger in magnitude in men than in women. While hormonal status of women was not reported, this result is in accordance with our present study (Buckner et al.  ). Gizewski et al. replicated these results comparing men and women, more specifically, women in their midluteal phase (Gizewski et al.  ). In a smaller sample, Halari et al. observed no significant differences in brain activation between men and women using a letter fluency task (Halari et al.  ). In accordance with a meta-analysis including 377 men and 442 women (Sommer et al.  ), synonym generation was strongly left-lateralized in men and women. \n\n\n### Menstrual cycle effects during synonym generation \n  \nOnly few studies have so far attempted to measure the influence of fluctuating sexual hormone levels across the menstrual cycle on fMRI activation patterns. Some behavioral observations point towards an effect of sexual hormones on cognitive functions (Hampson  ; Hausmann and Gunturkun  ), but this is discussed controversially (Gordon and Lee  ; Halari et al.  ; Roberts and Bell  ). Our current results, while obtained from a rather small sample size, do not support the hypothesis of performance differences in the measures applied. Our imaging results might indicate that menstrual cycle effects on fMRI activation patterns are unrelated to task performance, thus favoring a more biological explanation. This would be in accordance with an earlier and smaller study of Dietrich et al. who investigated six male and six female subjects during a word-stem-completion task, a mental rotation task, and a motor task (Dietrich et al.  ). In both cognitive tasks, the most pronounced increases of BOLD signal were observed in women during the peak estrogen condition (midluteal phase), while no significant differences occurred between male and female subjects in the low estrogen condition. This is in line with the trend observed in the present study. Fernandez et al. investigated 12 women, but no men, with a synonym-judgment task. In agreement with our data, they also observed higher activation during the midluteal phase (Fernandez et al.  ). In a study on emotional word processing, medio-orbitofrontal activity was also increased in the midluteal phase (Protopopescu et al.  ). In contrast, Veltman et al. investigated eight women and could not find influences of estrogen on a rhyming decision on word pairs. This lack of effect could possibly be attributed to the choice of the activation paradigm (phonological rather than semantic), and the small sample size (Veltman et al.  ). While we observed a trend towards higher left prefrontal activation, this trend did not reach statistic significance. However, this trend is in line with the data obtained by Dietrich et al. ( ), Fernandez et al. ( ) and Protopopescu et al. ( ). The lack of significance could imply that menstrual cycle does not exert any effects on BOLD signal, but given the data by others, it is more plausible that the effects are too small to reach statistic significance with group sizes of 12 subjects. We thus conclude that fMRI studies on semantic tasks should pay attention to menstrual cycle effects if group sizes exceed 12 subjects per group. \n\n\n### Correlation of brain activation with sex steroid hormone measurements \n  \nA major strength of this study is that sex hormone concentrations were assessed right before scanning. We were thus able to correlate sex hormone levels with brain activation during task performance. Interestingly, correlations depended on gender and phase of the menstrual cycle: estradiol correlations with brain activation were high in the high estrogen phase of the menstrual cycle, while progesterone correlations were significant in both phases investigated here. Testosterone correlated strongly with brain activation in all three groups. Our results underscore the potential influence of sex hormones on neurocognitive processes. The role of sex steroid hormones is extensively discussed for memory-related tasks, first and foremost in the context of hormone substitution in aging or demented populations. Effects for both testosterone (Driscoll and Resnick  ; Geerlings et al.  ; Zitzmann  ) and estradiol (Craig and Murphy  ; Doren  ; Genazzani et al.  ) have been reported for different cognitive domains. While our results are in line with findings on spatial working memory (Sch\u00f6ning et al.  ), findings on verbal memory are more ambiguous, reporting diverse effects of estrogen and/or testosterone (Carlson and Sherwin  ; Cherrier et al.  ; Martin et al.  ; Moffat et al.  ; Thilers et al.  ). In particular, the influence of sex hormones on behavioral performance is controversial. While some authors report behavioral effects (Hampson  ; Hausmann and Gunturkun  ) others do not (Gordon et al.  ; Gordon and Lee  ; Halari et al.  ; Mumenthaler et al.  ; Roberts and Bell  ). Our results also do not reveal performance differences in the behavioral measures applied here. Nevertheless, the results of the present study suggest that sex steroid hormones exert more direct effects on fMRI BOLD-signal changes which are unrelated to task performance. Our results fit well with the above-mentioned earlier studies on other verbal tasks, with the most pronounced increases of BOLD signal in women during the peak estrogen (midluteal) phase (Dietrich et al.  ; Fernandez et al.  ; Protopopescu et al.  ). \n\n\n### Physiological mechanisms \n  \nObviously, fMRI does not allow to directly investigate the biological and molecular action mechanisms underlying different BOLD responses in men and women, as a function of the phases of the menstrual cycle, and of sex hormone levels. Thus, sex hormone action on cerebral neurons or vascular effects would both be consistent with our results. Sex steroid hormones might exert direct effects on cerebral neurons, reflected by altered brain activation by many different routes. These effects might be mediated by intracellular neural estrogen receptors such as ER-alpha and ER-beta, but also by dendritic, presynaptic, or glial estrogen receptors, by ligand-gated ion channels, by effects on gene expression or on neural excitability, by second-messenger systems, or by interactions with the neurotransmitter systems. Alternatively or in addition, the neurovascular coupling might be altered by estrogen-induced cerebral vasodilatation and blood-flow changes. Estrogen might increase the concentration of vasodilatory nitric oxide (NO) through an Akt/PKB-enzyme dependent pathway and the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Although our data cannot clarify the mechanisms of action, they reveal an influence of gender, phase of menstrual cycle, and sex hormone levels on brain activation. Our results suggest that differences in brain activation do not solely depend on estrogen levels, as we found a clear-cut difference between men and women in their low estrogen phase. This can only be explained by a combined effect of sex steroid hormones. Indeed, correlations with progesterone in the female groups, and particularly testosterone in all three groups, emphasize the role of all three hormones on fMRI activation during synonym retrieval. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nSome limitations of our study should be mentioned. Rigorous exclusion of subjects with abnormal sex hormone levels restricted the sample size to 12 subjects per group, limiting statistical power. Further, behavioral measures had to be acquired outside the scanner to avoid artifacts related to motor or verbal responses during functional image acquisition. As in many imaging study, cognitive effort required for task performance could not be measured. Nevertheless, we aimed at obtaining objective performance measures for synonym retrieval reflecting within-scanner performance by examining both repeated and novel target items. In particular, the cautious control of hormonal levels is unique to the present fMRI study design. \n\nThis study demonstrates a cerebral network involved in semantic retrieval that is influenced by gender and sex steroid hormones. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table\u00a01\nUnnamed: 0\tWomen during early follicular phase\tWomen during midluteal phase\tMen\nNumber of subjects\t12\t12\t12\nAge\t30.8 \u00b1 5.0\t30.8 \u00b1 5.0\t33.2 \u00b1 6.2\nIntelligence, more visuo-spatially based estimate measure (CFT)\t118.3 \u00b1 13.7\t118.3 \u00b1 13.7\t124.0 \u00b1 10.2\nIntelligence, more verbally based estimate measure (MWT-B)\t112.0 \u00b1 13.6\t112.0 \u00b1 13.6\t117.0 \u00b1 11.9\nTestosterone in ng/mla\t0.34 \u00b1 0.13\t0.37 \u00b1 0.13\t5.10 \u00b1 1.45*\nEstradiol in pg/mlb\t46.75 \u00b1 11.10*\t129.00 \u00b1 56.81*\t36.0 \u00b1 6.30*\nProgesterone in ng/mlc\t0.65 \u00b1 0.15\t10.02 \u00b1 5.70*\t0.70 \u00b1 0.20\nReproduction Quantity score\t47.7 \u00b1 21.0\t48.3 \u00b1 18.9\t50.8 \u00b1 22.3\nReproduction Quality score\t9.3 \u00b1 4.0\t9.8 \u00b1 3.1\t10.2 \u00b1 2.8\nReproduction Quality/quality ratio\t0.23 \u00b1 0.12\t0.24 \u00b1 0.14\t0.23 \u00b1 0.09\nNovel generation Quantity score\t40.6 \u00b1 19.3\t44.8 \u00b1 16.8\t44.7 \u00b1 15.7\nNovel generation Quality score\t4.7 \u00b1 1.4\t6.6 \u00b1 2.1\t5.9 \u00b1 2.0\nNovel generation Quality/quality ratio\t0.16 \u00b1 0.15\t0.17 \u00b1 0.09\t0.14 \u00b1 0.06\n### Caption\nSubjects baseline characterization and task performance (mean \u00b1 SD)\n### Footer\nT tests between groups are not significant if not indicated otherwise. *Value differs significantly from value in other groupsa For women during the early follicular phase and women during the midluteal phase versus men P < 0.001bFor women during the early follicular phase versus men P = 0.008.

Since then, numerous studies have identified additional body-parts representations outside of S1. Nevertheless, it has been implicitly assumed that S1\u2019s homunculus is representative of the entire somatosensory cortex. Therefore, the distribution of body-parts representations in other brain regions, the property that gave Penfield\u2019s homunculus its famous \u2018grotesque\u2019 appearance, has been overlooked. We used whole-body somatosensory stimulation, functional MRI and a new cortical parcellation to quantify the organization of the cortical somatosensory representation. Our analysis showed first, an extensive somatosensory response over the cortex; and second, that the proportional representation of body parts differs substantially between major neuroanatomical regions and from S1, with, for instance, much larger trunk representation at higher brain regions, potentially in relation to the regions\u2019 functional specialization. These results extend Penfield\u2019s initial findings to the higher level of somatosensory processing and suggest a major role for somatosensation in human cognition. \n  \nThe homunculus, a \u2018grotesque creature\u2019 depicting the proportional representation of the human body on the primary somatosensory cortex, is a most influential discovery in neuroscience. A new study reveals that these proportions substantially differ between different cortical regions, in view of their functional specialization. \n   Graphical Abstract  \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe establishment of the homunculus, a schematic drawing reflecting the disproportional representation of the parts of the human body on the motor and somatosensory cortex, was an important milestone for the neurosciences. Eighty years ago, Penfield and Boldrey electrically stimulated the cortical surface of patients undergoing brain surgery. They used the patients\u2019 subjective reports of somatosensory sensations to identify representation of different body parts in the post-central gyrus, known as the primary somatosensory cortex (S1,  ). One of their significant findings was that the cortical surface area associated with a body part (\u2018spatial distribution\u2019 of body parts) is not proportional to the surface area of the body part itself. Instead, the face and hands are overrepresented, while the trunk and legs occupy disproportionately small cortical areas. A schematic drawing of a human figure with body parts corresponding to the size of their cortical (S1) representation, yielded the famous \u2018grotesque creature\u2019 with large hands and lips and rather small trunk and legs, known as the somatosensory homunculus ( ;  ;  ). Later, it was suggested that the spatial distribution depicted by the homunculus reflects the level of neuronal peripheral innervation (e.g.  ;  ;  ). The disproportionate spatial distribution of body parts is likely to be of functional significance, underlying the greater somatosensory discrimination ability for the enlarged body parts in the corresponding cortical homunculus. \n\nPenfield and his colleagues also identified somatosensory representations in other cortical areas. These include the precentral gyrus (the primary motor area, M1;  ), the superior bank of the lateral fissure (the secondary somatosensory area, S2), the insular cortex and the medial cortex (supplementary motor area;  ;  ;  ). Later studies used electrophysiological recordings in non-human primates and functional neuroimaging in humans in response to somatosensory stimulation to further identify and characterize the cortical somatosensory system (e.g.  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Additional somatosensory representations were detected in the superior and inferior parietal lobules ( ;  ;  ;  ), inferior frontal gyrus, frontal operculum ( ) and the cingulate cortex ( ). Large body of works focused on specific localizations of body-parts representations across the different cortical regions. In contrast, surprisingly little attention has been given to the spatial distribution of body parts across the cortical surface, the property that gave Penfield\u2019s homunculus of S1 its famous characteristic \u2018grotesque\u2019 appearance. \n\nThe goal of this research is to quantify the spatial distribution of body parts across the entire somatosensory cortex. We first characterized the somatosensory cortex by measuring its response to a bilateral whole-body continuous tactile stimulation, using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Interestingly, our measurements revealed extended somatosensory cortical response to tactile stimulation. Second, we quantified the spatial distribution of body parts in different anatomically distinct cortical regions. Spatial distribution of body parts substantially varied between regions and S1. We interpret the differences in these distributions as reflecting functional specialization. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe study included 20 healthy participants [as standard in the field; 9 females, age: 27.45\u2009 \u20093.33\u2009years old (mean  SD)]. Participants did not report any history of neurological, psychiatric or systemic disorder. All participants gave written informed consent, and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the Hadassah Medical Center. \n\n\n### Experimental paradigm \n  \nA light-touch somatosensory stimulation was applied to the lips, hand (dorsal part), forearm, upper arm, shoulder, lateral trunk, hip, thigh (medial part), knee, shin, foot (dorsal part) and the toes ( ;  ). The stimulation was delivered using a 4-cm-wide paint-brush (with extended handle of 65-cm plastic stick) by an experimenter, who was well-trained before the scans to maintain a constant pace and pressure. The stimulation was unilateral and continuous (without lifting the brush from the skin), except for one discontinuity between the lips and the hand. To control the timing of the body-part sequence, the experimenter wore MRI-compatible headphones, delivering pre-programmed auditory cues (Presentation; Neurobehavioral Systems). Stimulation duration was 15\u2009s and the interval between stimulations was 12\u2009s. Each scanning run included seven repetitions of stimulation of one body side (right/left), followed by seven repetitions of stimulation of the other body side (left/right). The order (right/left) was counter-balanced between participants. To control for time order and directionality effect, each participant was measured in two scanning runs that differed in the order of body-parts stimulations, from lips-to-toes and from toes-to-lips. Run duration was 423\u2009s [282 repetition time (TR)], which included a 30\u2009s of measurement before the onset of the first repetition and 4.5\u2009s measurement after the last repetition, in addition to 12\u2009s delay between the stimulation of the two body sides.\n \n  \n Experimental paradigm, somatosensory cortical representation and body-parts spatial distribution.   (  A  ) Scheme of whole-body continuous brush movement from lips-to-toes and from toes-to-lips (black arrows) bilaterally in two different scanning runs. Body parts defined along the continuous stimulation: lips (red), distal upper limb (orange), proximal upper limb (yellow), upper trunk (light green), lower trunk (green), proximal lower limb (light blue), mid-lower limb (blue) and distal lower limb (dark blue). (  B  ) Cross-correlation group maps (  N  \u2009=\u200920; see colour code in A) corresponding to stimulation of the contralateral body side are shown on the lateral and medial surfaces as well as the operculum and insula cortices (LH: left hemisphere; RH = right hemisphere; level of significance: at least 2/3 of the participants with significance   P  \u2009<\u20090.003, corrected for multiple correlations, see Materials and methods section; random effect yielded similar results,  ). Landmarks: M1 = primary motor cortex; S1 = primary somatosensory cortex; S2 = secondary somatosensory cortex; SMA = supplementary motor area. (  C  ) Quantification of body parts [lips, upper limb (proximal and distal combined), trunk (upper and lower combined) and lower limb (proximal, mid and distal combined)] spatial distribution in S1 (left, BA: 3a, 3b, 1, 2) and in the entire somatosensory responsive cortex (right) averaged across two hemispheres (error bars are standard deviation, computed by bootstrapping over participants). Note the different percentage of trunk and lips between S1 and the entire somatosensory responsive cortex. (  D  ) The original schematic homunculus representation of S1 adopting Penfield\u2019s homunculus (top) and a modified version for the entire somatosensory responsive cortex (bottom). \n  \n\n### Functional MRI image acquisition procedures and pre-processing \n  \nAll participants were scanned at the same site using a Siemens Skyra 3T system (32-channel head coil) with the same imaging sequence. Blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired using a whole-brain, gradient-echo (GE) echoplanar (EPI) [TR/time echo (TE) = 1500/27\u2009ms, flip angle = 90, field of view (FOV) = 192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192\u2009mm, matrix = 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964 (in-plane resolution 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093  ), 26 axial slices, slice thickness/gap = 4\u2009mm/0.8\u2009mm]. In addition, high resolution (1\u2009\u00d7\u20091 \u00d7 1\u2009mm) T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired to aid spatial normalization to standard atlas space. The anatomic reference volume was acquired along the same orientation as the functional images [TR/TE = 2300/2.98\u2009ms, matrix = 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, 160 axial slices, 1-mm slice thickness, inversion time (TI) = 900\u2009ms]. Pre-processing was performed using the BrainVoyager QX 20.4.0.3188 software package (Brain Innovation) and NeuroElf ( ), including head motion correction (trilinear interpolation for detection and sinc for correction), slice scan time correction and high-pass filtering (cut-off frequency, two cycles per scan: 0.005\u2009Hz). Temporal smoothing (FWHM = 4\u2009s) and spatial smoothing (FWHM = 4\u2009mm) were additionally applied ( ). Functional and anatomical datasets for each participant were co-registered and normalized to standardized MNI (ICBM-152) space. All further analyses were performed using in-house custom Matlab (Mathworks, Inc.) scripts. \n\n\n### Cross-correlation analysis \n  \nTo identify the cortical distribution of the somatosensory system, we used a cross-correlation analysis. Each body side was analysed separately by splitting voxels\u2019 time course (137 TR each: 27\u2009s per repetition, 7 repetitions, 1.5\u2009s per TR: 27 \u00d7 7/1.5\u2009=\u2009126\u2009+\u20098 TR prior to beginning of stimulation and 3 TR after stimulation). A boxcar function (3\u2009s) was convolved with a two gamma hemodynamic response function, to derive a predictor for the analysis. This predictor and the time course of each voxel were cross-correlated to measure responses to different parts of the stimulation cycle (body parts). The first TR in the stimulation block was excluded to avoid any effects of expectancy or surprise. The predictor was cross-correlated across all TR in the block except the last to allow averaging of the two opposite stimulation directions (\u2018start lips\u2019 and \u2018start toes\u2019). Stimulation duration of each cycle had 10 TR, thus, cross-correlation analysis produced eight correlation values for each voxel, indicating correlation to different parts of the stimulation cycle (each TR was assigned to a specific body part by its stimulation time: 1-lips, 2-distal upper limb, 3-proximal upper limb, 4-upper trunk, 5-lower trunk, 6-proximal lower limb, 7-mid-lower limb, 8-distal lower limb). For each voxel of each participant, we flipped the order of the correlation values of the start toes paradigm and then averaged the correlation distributions of both start lips and start toes directions. The averaged distribution maximum defined the preferred body part (lag value) of each voxel. A correlation threshold of   r  \u2009>\u20090.251 was applied to identify voxels responding significantly to the stimulation (two-tailed   t  -test, \u03b1\u2009=\u2009 0.05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple correlations; 8 lag values \u00d7 two paradigms, 135 degrees of freedom,   P  \u2009<\u20090.003). To generate a group map, all correlation distributions across participants were averaged in each voxel. Only voxels that were above the significance threshold in >2/3 of the participants were included in the analysis (random effect yielded similar results,  ). \n\n\n### Cortical parcellation and identification of somatosensory responsive areas \n  \nIn this study, we applied a recently introduced multi-modal data-driven parcellation ( ). This parcellation uses multi-modal magnetic resonance images from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and an objective semi-automated neuroanatomical approach to delineate 180 areas per hemisphere, bounded by sharp changes in cortical architecture, function, connectivity and/or topography ( ). Since this parcellation is surface-based, cross-correlation maps were projected on an averaged inflated cortical surface (Trilinear interpolation, data in depth along vertex normal from \u22121 mm to 3\u2009mm of grey\u2013white matter border; FreeSurfer\u2019s, fsaverage template brain;  ). Parcellation areas containing >50% of vertices responding to body stimulation were defined as somatosensory responsive areas ( ). Only significant vertices were considered, this threshold was used to eliminate areas which did not pass majority rule (i.e. areas with <50% significant vertices). Yet, we did not include insignificant vertices in the analysis, even in supra-threshold parcellation areas. \n\n\n### Gross-anatomy classification \n  \nThe somatosensory system as found here lies over four gross-anatomical regions, including the anterior part of the parietal lobe [from Brodmann area (BA) 3a to the ventral and medial intraparietal areas (BA 7)], the posterior part of the frontal lobe (from BA 4 to the anterior end of BA 6), the superior part of the medial wall (from the medial end of the pre- and post-central gyri to the middle cingulate gyrus) and the operculum-insular cortex (from parietal and frontal operculum to temporal operculum through the posterior insula). In order to define these regions precisely, we utilized the above-mentioned parcellation. We classified each of the somatosensory parcellation areas according to the following criteria: the parietal region includes all areas on the lateral surface posterior to the central sulcus, the frontal region includes all areas on the lateral surface anterior to the central sulcus, the medial region includes all areas on the medial wall, and the operculum-insula region includes areas inferior to the parietal and frontal lobes of the operculum and insular cortex ( , \u2018Neuroanatomical results for a multi-modal parcellation of human cerebral cortex\u2019;  ). Note that areas 4, 6\u2009mp and 7\u2009Am ( ) on the lateral surface extend into the medial wall and that area 5L is somehow different from Brodmann\u2019s original definition, part of the medial region. Additional parcellation areas that were not included in these anatomical regions as part of the spatial continuous representation were found in the area of the temporo-occipital parietal junction and in the inferior-temporal gyrus (eight in the right hemisphere and seven in the left hemisphere, see  ). Relative proportions of each body part within the entire somatosensory system and in specific anatomical regions (gross and parcellation areas) were calculated according to the percentage of significant vertices with a given lag value (lips-1, upper limb-2,3, trunk-4,5, lower limb-6,7,8). To estimate the level of confidence, we applied bootstrapping by resampling participants to create 1000 cross-correlation maps. Confidence intervals (CI) correspond to 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles and errors are represented by the standard deviation of body-parts proportions. In addition, we created a schematic drawing of the relative proportions of body parts by modifying Penfield\u2019s S1 homunculus drawn by \u2018Cortical Homunculus\u2019, The Homunculus mapper, license CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 ( ;  ). Body parts of S1 schematic drawing were rescaled (using   Adobe Illustrator  CS6  ) following the results presented in  . The body parts were then reconnected into a modified homunculus schematic drawing. Note that not all body parts were stimulated (e.g. tongue and forehead). Therefore, these body parts are represented according to the schematic figure of S1 homunculus, similar to the illustration by  . \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nSpatial distribution of body parts in the somatosensory responsive cortex, S1 and the four gross-anatomical regions were computed for each participant. Significance of differences between regions was tested by a paired sample two-tailed   t  -test across participants (19 degrees of freedom). \n\n\n### Data availability \n  \nSingle subjects\u2019 maps can be found in   and spatial distribution of body parts in each parcellation area of the somatosensory responsive cortex can be found in  . Raw data and codes are available from the corresponding author upon request. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nFor each participant, we identified cortical voxels that responded significantly to the somatosensory stimulation (two-tailed   t  -test,   P  \u2009<\u20090.003, corrected for multiple correlations, see Materials and methods section;  ). Overall, group map (20 participants) shows that somatosensory representation in the contralateral hemisphere (which we operationally define as the somatosensory responsive cortex; ipsilateral maps,  ) spans >30% of the cortical surface (35.7%, 95% CI 30.6%\u201350.6% of the right hemisphere and 30.4%, 95% CI 23.6%\u201345.9% of the left hemisphere, surface area). The somatosensory map includes the previously identified somatosensory regions in S1, M1, S2, supplementary motor area, posterior insular cortex, superior and inferior parietal lobules, inferior frontal gyrus, frontal operculum and the cingulate cortex ( ). \n\nThe quantification of the spatial distribution of body parts in S1 [defined according to Brodmann\u2019s areas (BAs) 1, 2, 3a, 3b;  ] was found to be comparable with Penfield\u2019s somatosensory homunculus ( ;  ). That is, extensive representation of the upper limb (46.3%, 95% CI 41.5%\u201351.6%) and lips (28.9%, 95% CI 23.0%\u201333.5%), and lesser representation of the trunk (15.8%, 95% CI 13.7%\u201319.0%) and lower limb (9.1%, 95% CI 7.2%\u201310.6%;  , left). However, when we quantified the entire somatosensory cortex, the spatial distribution was significantly different. While the fractions of the cortical area devoted to the upper (41.1%, 95% CI 33.1%\u201346.0%) and lower (7.6%, 95% CI 6.5%\u201310.2%) limbs are both slightly smaller (but significant, paired sample two-tailed   t  -test, upper limb  , lower limb  ) than those in S1, the area devoted to the lips (20.1%, 95% CI 13.3%\u201326.2%) is only 70% of that in S1 (two-tailed   t  -test, ), and the trunk area (31.1%, 95% CI 22.8%\u201343.6%) is almost double than in S1 (two-tailed   t  -test,  ). Adopting Penfield\u2019s homunculus representation, S1 and the entire somatosensory responsive cortex are represented by very different homunculi ( ). These differences imply that principles other than the level of neuronal peripheral innervation, which is believed to underlie this distribution in S1 ( ;  ;  ), determine the spatial distribution of body parts in the cortex as a whole. \n\nTo study these principles, we asked whether anatomically distinct regions are characterized by different spatial distributions. According to fundamental subdivisions of the cortex\u2019 gross anatomy, somatosensory representations are found within the parietal lobe (S1 and posteriorly), the frontal lobe (anterior to S1), the medial wall (medial to S1) and operculum and insula (inferior to S1) regions. To precisely segment the cortex into these four regions, we capitalized on a recently introduced, data-driven multi-modal cortical parcellation that divides each hemisphere into 180 anatomically and functionally defined areas ( ). By using these areas to draw the borders between the four regions ( ), we were able to associate each vertex with its corresponding region (see also  ).\n \n  \n Quantitative differences in the spatial distributions of body parts (\u2018homunculi\u2019).   (  A  ) Subdivisions of the somatosensory responsive cortex into four gross-anatomical regions: parietal (S1 and posteriorly), frontal (anterior to S1), medial (medial to S1) and operculum-insula (inferior to S1). (  B  ) Distribution of the different body parts [lips, upper limb (proximal and distal combined), trunk (upper and lower combined) and lower limb (proximal, mid and distal combined)] within each gross-anatomical region averaged across two hemispheres (error bars are standard deviation, computed by bootstrapping over participants). (  C  ) Homunculi proportional representation of body parts in each gross-anatomical region as modified versions of Penfield\u2019s original homunculus (S1), as in  . \n  \nThe anterior parietal region, the somatosensory part of the parietal cortex (including S1), was found to encompass 32% of the somatosensory responsive cortex. Somatosensory representation in this region was dominated by the upper limb (53.5%, 95% CI 45.0%\u201359.6%), more than any other region (paired sample two-tailed   t  -test, frontal,  , medial,  , operculum-insula,  ). This was followed by a substantial representation of the trunk (25.1%, 95% CI 15.5%\u201335.3%), which is almost 60% greater than its representation in S1 (two-tailed   t  -test,  ). The representation of these two body parts come at the expense of the lips (16.6%, 95% CI 13.2%\u201322.7%) and the lower limb (4.8%, 95% CI 3.9%\u20135.9%;  , see also  ). In fact, the latter two representations are almost absent outside S1 in the parietal cortex (  and  ). \n\nThe posterior part of the frontal cortex comprises 18% of the somatosensory responsive cortex. The rank order of body-parts representation in the frontal region is identical to that in S1 (upper limb > lips > trunk > lower limb). However, there are quantitative differences in their relative sizes. The representation of the upper limb (34.0%, 95% CI 27.7%\u201344.3%) is smaller than its representation in S1 (two-tailed   t  -test,  ), allowing for a larger representation of the trunk (22.6%, 95% CI 11.5%\u201332.1%) and lower limb (14.9%, 95% CI 12.6%\u201316.9%). The relative representation of the lips (28.5%, 95% CI 21.8%-34.0%) is comparable to that in S1 (  and  ). \n\nThe medial region (12% of the somatosensory responsive cortex) is the most different from S1. The spatial distribution of body parts in this region is most similar to their veridical proportion (skin area;  ). The medial region is dominated by the trunk (40.3%, 95% CI 30.6%\u201349.3%), followed by the upper limb (28.9%, 95% CI 21.4%\u201336.1%), lower limb (23.4%, 95% CI 20.1%\u201328.5%) and lips (7.4%, 95% CI 4.4%\u201311.2%). The trunk and lower limb are highly represented in the medial region. The lower limb, significantly more than all other regions (paired sample two-tailed   t  -test, parietal,  , frontal,  , operculum-insula,  ), whereas the upper limb and lips are the least represented (paired sample two-tailed   t  -test, upper limb: parietal,  , frontal,  , operculum-insula,  , lips: parietal,  , frontal,  , operculum-insula,  ;   and  ). \n\nFinally, the operculum-insular cortex (16% of the somatosensory responsive cortex) is dominated by the upper limb (42.2%, 95% CI 35.9%\u201348.1%) and trunk (37.4%, 95% CI 28.2%\u201345.3%). There is less representation of the lips (17.7%, 95% CI 12.5%\u201324.1%) and the representation of the lower limb is nearly absent (2.7%, 95% CI 1.7%\u20134.8%;   and  ). We also found somatosensory representations in the area of the temporo-occipital parietal junction and at the inferior-temporal gyrus (22% of the somatosensory responsive cortex) that are topologically disconnected from S1 along the somatosensory cortex ( ). Taken together, the spatial distributions of body parts in the four anatomical regions are substantially different from one another, as well as from S1, as represented by the different homunculi corresponding to the four regions ( ). These differences may be related to different functional specializations of these regions as discussed below. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nData-driven quantification of the somatosensory system revealed that it comprises a large fraction of the human cortex, which includes high-order regions, suggests that the somatosensory system plays a role in high-cognitive processing (which may be entitled \u2018somatosensory cognition\u2019). Quantification of the four gross-anatomical regions (parietal, frontal, medial and operculum-insula) revealed that the somatosensory responsive areas differ from each other, and from the primary somatosensory cortex (BAs 1, 2, 3a, 3b). Specifically, they are characterized by different distributions of body-parts representations, manifested in different homunculi ( ) that are distinctive from Penfield\u2019s classical S1 homunculus ( ). This heterogeneity in the distribution of body-parts representations implies different functional roles of the four homunculi. \n\nThe parietal somatosensory region is comprised of S1 and the anterior part of the inferior and superior parietal lobules. Upper limb and trunk representations dominate the parietal somatosensory region. This is particularly pronounced in the anterior parietal lobules (S1 excluded,  ). There, lower limb and lips representation are minimal. The higher proportion of upper limb and trunk representations in the parietal lobules (compared with S1) is consistent with their role in body-processing-related functions such as multisensory integration and bodily self-consciousness ( ;  ;  ;  ). The posterior parietal cortex is considered an area of sensorimotor interface for visually guided movements ( ;  ). Many studies in non-human primates and humans indicate that neurons in the posterior parietal cortex encode grasping and reaching movements (e.g.  ;  ;  ). Reaching, and more so grasping, entails somatosensory information. Consistent with these results is the prominent representation of the upper limb in the posterior parietal region ( ). \n\nThe frontal region includes all vertices that responded to somatosensory stimulation anterior to the central sulcus, including M1 (BA 4), the premotor cortex (BA 6) and parts of the frontal eye field. Body-parts representation in M1 is dominated by the lower limb and lips with little representation of upper limb and trunk ( ). By contrast, lower limb representation is almost absent anterior to M1. This increased upper limb and trunk representation is compatible with high-order functions of this region, since the premotor cortex is important not only for motor planning but also for body agency and embodiment ( ). Electrophysiological studies in non-human primates showed that neurons in the anterior superior parietal lobule and the premotor cortex integrate visual and somatosensory stimuli involving the arm and the trunk ( ;  ,  ;  ). Premotor-parietal orchestrated activity was highlighted by functional neuroimaging studies in humans as well as lesion studies in patients demonstrating the putative role of these regions in body processing of the hand and trunk ( ). These results are compatible with the substantial upper limb and trunk representations in both the anterior parietal lobules and the regions anterior to M1 found in our study. \n\nBody-parts distribution in the medial region is closest to human veridical proportions (unlike S1\u2019s \u2018grotesque creature\u2019), as evident in the homunculi illustrations ( ). The large representation of the lower limb, the highest of all regions, is consistent with clinical observations of leg-related pathologies ( ). Lower limb representation is particularly pronounced in the supplementary motor area. As in M1, the dominance of lower limb representation is consistent with the substantial role of the lower limb in motor actions. \n\nOur finding of somatosensory representations in the middle cingulate cortex (  and  ) is consistent with previous findings of somatosensory response elicited by electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves ( ) and evoked somatosensory sensation by direct intracranial stimulation of the middle cingulate cortex ( ). \n\nSomatosensory representation was found in the posterior insula which is known to be involved in the processing of body ownership, visceral effects and emotional modulations ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). We find that the representation of the trunk occupies one-third of the posterior insula ( ). The large proportion of the trunk in this region hints at the trunk\u2019s special role in the emotional aspects of somatosensory processing. \n\nWe have also identified somatosensory response in the temporal operculum (  and  ) which includes parts of the auditory cortex. This finding is in agreement with the large body of research regarding multisensory integration (e.g.  ). Interestingly, somatosensory representation in the associative auditory areas was restricted to the right hemisphere ( ). This asymmetry, we speculate, may be related to the more dominant role of the right hemisphere in auditory spatial processing ( ). \n\nOur results first and foremost establish that the distribution of body parts varies between regions and specifically from the distribution in S1. Our interpretations, to a certain degree, depend on the grouping of parcellation areas into gross-anatomical regions. While the frontal, parietal and insular areas are well-defined, the operculum can either be divided and grouped with the frontal and parietal regions or can be grouped with the insula. The newly defined large number of parcellation areas ( ) enabled distinction between lateral and medial regions with four exceptions: areas 4, 6mp, 5L and 7Am (with both medial and lateral parts). Most of area 4 (M1) and most of area 6mp reside in the lateral part, and therefore, they were taken as part of the frontal region. Areas 7Am and 5L were added to the corresponding somatosensory sub-areas of BA 5 (medial) and 7 (parietal), respectively.  , which depicts the spatial distribution of body parts in each somatosensory parcellation area (see also  ) allows the reader to study the consequences of a different segmentation. \n\nThis study confronts several limitations. First, due to the difficulty in the accessibility within the MRI apparatus and the continuous stimulation applied, we did not cover the entire skin surface of the body. While the classical S1 homunculus presents prominent lips representation, we cannot exclude more prominent representation of upper face/head in homunculi outside of S1, as we have shown for the trunk. Nevertheless, the fact that body-parts spatial distribution in S1 was found comparable with Penfield\u2019s somatosensory homunculus suggests that this did not significantly affected the final results. Further research with a wider MRI machines and additional body coverage may elaborate our findings. Second, the experimental paradigm investigates whole-brain response to stimulation of each body part separately, in a continuous manner, and not multiple body parts or body sides simultaneously. Further studies may address questions regarding the linearity of the somatosensory response and bilateral interactions as was suggested previously (e.g.  ). \n\nIn conclusion, using a novel approach, the current work has demonstrated how large fraction of the human cortex, including high-order regions, is involved in processing light touch somatosensory stimulation. The spatial distributions of body parts in different anatomical regions were found to differ substantially from S1. Spatial distributions were unique to each region and are likely related to the region\u2019s functional specialization. Our findings suggest that somatosensation plays a major role in human cognition. Future research should further develop these findings and incorporate them into a joint framework of \u2018somatosensory cognition\u2019. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7425349, "text_md5": "3ea51814f1a84dde312c265d3b6a772c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 62], "journal": [63, 75], "publication_year": [77, 81], "title": [92, 150], "keywords": [164, 219], "abstract": [232, 1960], "body": [1969, 32315], "tables": [32328, 32328]}, "batch": 19, "pmid": 32954277, "doi": "10.1093/braincomms/fcaa003", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7425349", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7425349"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7425349\">7425349</a>", "list_title": "PMC7425349  The \u2018creatures\u2019 of the human cortical somatosensory system"}

Results of structural covariance studies should be interpreted with caution, particularly when subject groups are likely to move their heads in the scanner.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nAnalysis of the covariance of regional grey matter volume and related morphometric measures across subjects is a widely used MRI\u2010based network analysis technique that is used to investigate neuroanatomical changes in disease and healthy aging (Alexander\u2010Bloch et al.,\u00a0 ; Alexander\u2010Bloch, Giedd, et al.,\u00a0 ; Alexander\u2010Bloch, Raznahan, et al.,\u00a0 ; Bassett et al.,\u00a0 ; Bernhardt et al.,\u00a0 ; Bethlehem et al.,\u00a0 ; Coppen et al.,\u00a0 ; DuPre & Spreng,\u00a0 ; He et al.,\u00a0 ; Irimia & Van Horn,\u00a0 ; Montembeault et al.,\u00a0 ; Montembeault et al.,\u00a0 ; Romero\u2010Garcia et al.,\u00a0 ; Valk et al.,\u00a0 ; Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ). The primary underlying assumption of structural covariance analyses is that regional covariation of morphometric estimates reflects neuroanatomical connectivity between brain regions. In this study, we test this assumption by investigating the effect of in\u2010scanner head motion on construction and graph theoretic analysis of structural covariance networks. \n\nIn\u2010scanner head motion has been previously demonstrated to cause brain\u2010wide changes in morphometric estimates derived from structural MRI scans (Alexander\u2010Bloch et al.,\u00a0 ; Pardoe et al.,\u00a0 ; Reuter et al.,\u00a0 ; Savalia et al.,\u00a0 ). Increased head motion is generally associated with brain\u2010wide apparent reductions in cortical thickness and regional gray matter volume. Previous studies have shown that head motion is typically increased in disease groups relative to healthy controls and varies by age, with children and elderly adults showing increased head motion relative to adults aged between 15 and 40\u2009years (Pardoe et al.,\u00a0 ; Savalia et al.,\u00a0 ). Although the effect of head motion on MRI\u2010based estimates of regional cortical thickness, volume and related neuroanatomical measures has been extensively described recently, the effect of motion on higher order multivariate analytical approaches such as structural covariance analysis is yet to be established. \n\nStructural covariance networks are inferred by measuring the correlation of regional volume or other morphometric estimates between pairs of brain regions across subjects. Because head motion increases variability in regional morphometric estimates across the whole brain, it is likely that the concurrent variation in members of any pair of regional estimates is increased, increasing the measured correlation between these pairs. This effect can be conceptualized as a corollary of the restricted range phenomenon, in which the measured correlation between two variables is reduced if the sample is drawn from a limited range of the population (Goodwin & Leech,\u00a0 ). In the case of in\u2010scanner head motion, we hypothesize that the inclusion of motion\u2010affected scans will increase variability in morphometric estimates across subjects and subsequently increase the measured correlation between pairs of brain regions. \n\nWe investigated the effect of head motion on structural covariance networks by obtaining both motion\u2010affected and low\u2010motion whole brain T1\u2010weighted MRI scans in healthy adult subjects. The scans described as \u201clow\u2010motion\u201d can be considered equivalent to scans obtained in a typical clinical imaging setting. Our imaging dataset was used to obtain regional gray matter volume estimates following a voxel\u2010based morphometry (VBM) approach similar to that used in a number of prior studies (Bassett et al.,\u00a0 ; Coppen et al.,\u00a0 ; DuPre & Spreng,\u00a0 ; Montembeault et al.,\u00a0 ; Montembeault et al.,\u00a0 ; Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ). We systematically varied the number of motion\u2010affected scans included in each group and assessed how this influenced metrics related to network construction and commonly used graph theoretic measures. Our primary analyses used the widely used AAL parcellation scheme; however, we also carried out additional analyses using a novel automated parcellation scheme that systematically varied the number of nodes used to parcellate a template. \n\nFinally, we describe a postprocessing method for ameliorating the influence of subject motion on structural covariance networks. Our proposed approach used image quality metrics to weight GM volume estimates that were used to estimate interregional correlations, as opposed to using standard nonweighted correlations. Weighted correlations were derived from datasets that included motion\u2010affected scans and compared these with ground\u2010truth correlations derived from datasets that only included low\u2010motion scans. If weighted correlations were closer to ground truth low\u2010motion correlations than their standard unweighted equivalent, this provided supporting evidence that the approach may be a useful technique for addressing the problem of systematic errors in structural covariance networks due to in\u2010scanner head motion. \n\nIf the inclusion of motion\u2010affected scans affects the construction of structural covariance networks and derived metrics, regional covariance of volumes and related morphometric measures across subjects may not always reflect anatomical connectivity. In general, if subject groups differ in the amount of in\u2010scanner head motion, differences in graph theoretic network metrics derived from structural covariance analyses of these groups may not be due to neurobiological differences. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \nWhole brain T1w MRI scans were obtained in 29 healthy control subjects recruited via community advertisement (mean age 33\u2009\u00b1\u200913\u2009years, 13 female). Approval for the study was obtained from the NYU Langone Health Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. MRI scans and scripts associated with the analyses presented in this study are provided at   (Pardoe & Martin,\u00a0 ). \n\nParticipants were imaged on a Siemens 3\u00a0T Prisma MRI scanner. Two T1w MPRAGE MRI scans were acquired per participant in each imaging session; a motion\u2010affected scan, in which participants moved their heads in stereotyped prompted motions during the scan, and a low motion scan in which participants held their head still. For a subset of study participants (  N  \u00a0=\u00a023) the motion\u2010affected and low\u2010motion acquisitions were repeated in the same scanning session, yielding four T1\u2010weighted MRI scans per participant (2 \u00d7 motion\u2010affected, 2 \u00d7 low\u2010motion). The low\u2010motion scans from the subset of participants with repeat scans were used to assess the test\u2013retest reliability of regional correlations used to construct structural covariance. For the motion\u2010affected scans, in\u2010scanner head motion was prompted using a video presented to participants during the scan. Participants were instructed to shake their head in a \u201cno\u201d type motion, equivalent to roll around the long axis of the MRI scanner. Low\u2010motion scans were not rejected or repeated if subtle head motion artifacts were present. For all cases, the motion\u2010affected scans had substantially more visually detectable motion artifacts than the low\u2010motion scans. \n\nImage acquisition parameters: MRI scans were acquired in the sagittal plane with a 256\u2009mm  field of view, 176 slices with 1\u2009mm slice thickness to yield a 1\u2009mm isotropic voxel size. Echo time (TE)\u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a08\u00b0, inversion time (TI)\u00a0=\u00a00.9\u00a0s, repetition time\u00a0=\u00a02.5\u00a0s. \n\nImage quality was quantitatively assessed using (i) the weighted overall image quality index obtained from the CAT12 SPM toolbox (version CAT12.8\u2010Beta (r1844),  ) and (ii) the Euler number, derived from cortical surface reconstructions obtained using the Freesurfer software package (v6.0; Dale et al.,\u00a0 ). The latter measure summarizes the topological complexity of the surface delineating the boundary between white and gray matter and has been shown to reliably detect reduced image quality in T1\u2010weighted MRI scans (Rosen et al.,\u00a0 ). For our analysis, we calculated the Euler number using the left and right cortical surfaces obtained prior to the Freesurfer topological defect correction routines; the surfaces are named \u201clh.nofix.orig\u201d and \u201crh.nofix.orig,\u201d respectively. The composite Euler numbers were then averaged across hemispheres as per the approach described by Rosen et al (Rosen et al.,\u00a0 ). The CAT12\u2010based image quality indices and Euler numbers were compared between motion\u2010affected and low\u2010motion groups using linear models. \n\nMRI scans were segmented and co\u2010registered using the DARTEL toolbox provided in the SPM12 software package (Ashburner,\u00a0 ). A custom template was created from the motion\u2010free dataset. Scans were segmented using a six\u2010compartment model, with the first two compartments comprising gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). The GM and WM segments were coregistered to MNI space via nonrigid coregistration to the custom template. GM segments were smoothed using an 8\u2009mm Gaussian smoothing filter. Regional GM volumes were estimated by calculating the mean GM value within each region defined in the AAL atlas (Tzourio\u2010Mazoyer et al.,\u00a0 ). We excluded cerebellar brain regions from our analyses, thereby yielding GM volume estimates in 90 brain regions. Covariance matrices were estimated from regional GM values across subjects by measuring the Pearson correlation (  r  ) between brain regions. Matrices were thresholded and binarized to construct undirected adjacency matrices. Undirected adjacency matrices were thresholded by calculating the Pearson   r   value threshold that corresponded to a fixed target edge density; this is a standard approach used in a number of previous studies (Alexander\u2010Bloch et al.,\u00a0 ; Alexander\u2010Bloch, Raznahan, et al.,\u00a0 ; Bethlehem et al.,\u00a0 ; He et al.,\u00a0 ; Romero\u2010Garcia et al.,\u00a0 ). Subject groups were formed by systematically increasing the number of motion\u2010affected scans in each group, ranging from no motion\u2010affected scans to all motion\u2010affected scans. \n\nPrior to our primary analysis of the effect of in\u2010scanner motion on structural covariance networks, we investigated the test\u2013retest reliability of structural covariance networks constructed using the VBM approach described above as well as cortical thickness and regional volume estimates derived from Freesurfer. These analyses were carried out to determine whether morphometric estimates derived from our sample were suitable for our goal of investigating the effect of head motion on structural covariance networks. Recent prior research suggested that our overall sample size of   N  \u00a0=\u00a029 subjects is close to the lower limit for reliable structural covariance network estimation, and that covariance networks estimated using regional cortical thickness estimates have lower reliability than those constructed from volume estimates when the same sample size is used\u00a0(Carmon et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nOur test\u2013retest analyses used the   N  \u00a0=\u00a023 subset of our study population who had four MRI scans acquired per imaging session, comprising 2 \u00d7\u2009motion\u2010affected scans and 2 \u00d7\u2009low\u2010motion scans. MRI scans were processed using the longitudinal processing stream of Freesurfer v6.0 (Reuter et al.,\u00a0 ) with default settings. Regional cortical thickness and volume estimates were obtained using the Desikan\u2013Killiany atlas (Desikan et al.,\u00a0 ), yielding 68 regional estimates per MRI scan. Covariance matrices were constructed by measuring the Pearson correlation between brain regions as per the previously described VBM approach. Test\u2013retest reliability was assessed by comparing region\u2010wise   r   values in the repeated low\u2010motion datasets using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). For our analyses, we used the single score intraclass correlation method implemented in the \u201cirr\u201d R software toolbox (Gamer et al.,\u00a0 ). Morphometric estimates were deemed appropriate for subsequent analysis if the lower bound for the 95% ICC confidence interval was above 0.9. \n\nWe investigated how in\u2010scanner head motion\u2010affected structural covariance network construction by measuring the following as the number of motion\u2010affected scans included in each dataset increased: (i) the variability in volume estimates, assessed by measuring the standard deviation in each brain region across subjects; (ii) Pearson correlation coefficients (  r  ) between volumes of brain regions; and (iii) the Pearson   r   thresholds required to obtain fixed edge densities\u00a0=\u00a00.1, 0.15, and 0.2. We also investigated how commonly used graph theoretic network metrics, consisting of (i) global clustering coefficient (transitivity), (ii) modularity, (iii) global efficiency, and (iv) small world index varied as a function of the number of motion\u2010affected scans in each group. These analyses are described in more detail below. Analyses were carried out using the R software package with the iGraph, brainGraph, and qgraph libraries (Csardi & Nepusz,\u00a0 ; Epskamp et al.,\u00a0 ; Team, R.C.,\u00a0 ; Watson,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe global clustering coefficient or transitivity is the ratio of the number of closed triplets (triangles) to the total number of triplets in the network. We calculated this property using the iGraph toolbox (Csardi & Nepusz,\u00a0 ). Modularity summarizes how a network is subdivided into communities; networks with high modularity contain subgraphs (communities) that are highly connected with each other but sparsely connected to other subgraphs. For our analyses, communities were detected using the fast greedy modularity algorithm implemented in the iGraph toolbox (Clauset et al.,\u00a0 ; Csardi & Nepusz,\u00a0 ). Global efficiency is related to how network structure influences how information can be transmitted across a network and was calculated using the brainGraph toolbox following the formulation presented by Latora and Marchiori (Latora & Marchiori,\u00a0 ; Watson,\u00a0 ). Small world index was estimated using the qgraph toolbox following the methods described byWatts and Strogatz (Epskamp et al.,\u00a0 ; Watts & Strogatz,\u00a0 ). \n\nA bootstrapping approach was used to estimate how GM estimates derived from motion\u2010affected scans affected (i) the across\u2010subject standard deviation in each brain region and (ii) the Pearson correlation r between pairs of brain regions. The number of motion\u2010affected scans included was systematically increased from zero (no motion\u2010affected scans) to 29 (all motion\u2010affected scans). For each iteration,   N  \u00a0=\u00a05000 samples were drawn with replacement and (i) the across\u2010subject standard deviation in each brain region and (ii) pairwise correlations in mean GM values between brain regions were calculated (Figure\u00a0 ). The relationship between average standard deviation across brain regions and the percentage of motion\u2010affected scans was tested using a linear model. In order to assess the spatial distribution of this relationship we also carried out this inference on a per\u2010node basis, and mapped the correlation between the percentage of motion\u2010affected scans included and (i) regional average GM and (ii) regional standard deviation to color scales to generate maps showing the regional distribution of these changes. The relationship between average pairwise correlation across all nodes and the percentage of motion\u2010affected scans was also tested using a linear model. \n  \nA schematic diagram of our bootstrapping approach to estimating how the inclusion of motion\u2010affected scans affects structural covariance networks. The original sample of 29 participants with motion\u2010affected (red circles) and low motion (blue circles) was resampled with systematically increasing numbers of motion\u2010affected scans. For each sample, the following parameters were estimated: (i) within\u2010region of interest (ROI) standard deviation across all regions; (ii) between\u2010ROI correlation (r) across all pairs of ROIs; (iii) graph theoretic metrics derived from structural covariance networks constructed from each sample. Five thousand resamples were taken for each setting of the number of motion\u2010affected scans to be included in the analyses. \n  \nWe investigated how the inclusion of motion\u2010affected scans affected the threshold   r   value required to obtain undirected adjacency matrices with a prespecified fixed edge density. Target edge densities of 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 were used. As in previous analyses, a bootstrapping approach was used to estimate the average   r   value required to obtain the target densities as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increased. The 5000 samples were drawn with replacement for each iteration as the number of motion\u2010affected scans in the dataset was increased. The relationship between threshold   r   value and percentage of motion\u2010affected scans was tested using a linear model. \n\nWe also investigated how in\u2010scanner head motion affects graph theoretic network measures that are commonly used in structural covariance studies to assess differences between subject groups. Specific metrics included measures of network segregation, consisting of transitivity (also known as clustering coefficient) and modularity, measures of network integration including global efficiency and small world index. For these analyses, the graph theoretic estimates were obtained from graphs constructed from adjacency matrices that were thresholded to obtain target edge densities\u00a0=\u00a00.1, 0.15, and 0.2. As in the previous analyses, 5000 samples were drawn with replacement as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increased, with the four graph theoretic metrics calculated for each sample. \n\nGiven that structural covariance assesses relationships between brain regions, we investigated how the correlation and subsequent inferred connections between nodes varies as a function of internode distance in the presence of head motion. We measured the average Euclidean distance between connected nodes from structural covariance networks while systematically increasing the number of motion\u2010affected scans as per the previous analyses. If proximal connections were preserved or removed as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increased, we should observe systematic changes in the average spatial distance between connected nodes. If the average spatial distance increased, it meant that distal connections were preserved (or conversely proximal connections were removed); likewise, if the average distance decreased it would suggest that distal connections were removed. \n\nWe investigated how varying the parcellation scheme affects the relationship between structural covariance networks and head motion. The same custom template used for the prior analyses was parcellated using the following approach. A binary GM segment was derived from the probabilistic custom template using a threshold\u00a0=\u00a00.01. The number of nodes for each parcellation   nSeed   was set to 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400. For each value of   nSeed  , the GM segment was unwrapped from 3D into a 1D vector and seeded   nSeed   times evenly spaced over the 1D vector. The 1D vector was then re\u2010mapped back into 3D space and the seed labels were expanded using the \u201cexpand_label\u201d function provided as part of the scikit\u2010image python image\u2010processing module (van der Walt et al.,\u00a0 ). This approach yielded custom parcellations with systematically reduced size of individual regions of interest as the number of nodes increased (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nCustom parcellations used to investigate how parcellation schemes influence structural covariance networks in the presence of motion\u2010affected scans. The images show parcellations with number of nodes (from left to right)\u00a0=\u00a0200, 250, 300, 350, and 400. \n  \nRegional GM volumes and structural covariance networks were estimated by calculating (i) the mean GM values within each region and (ii) the Pearson correlation between regions for each custom parcellation, following the previously described analyses that used the AAL atlas. We investigated how the use of different parcellations modified the standard deviation of regional GM values in the presence of motion\u2010affected scans; how the between\u2010node Pearson correlation varied when using different parcellations; and how the previously described graph theoretic metrics varied when different parcellations were used. For the latter analyses, a fixed edge density\u00a0=\u00a00.1 was used to construct the networks. \n\nFor our proposed weighted correlation method for correcting for in\u2010scanner head motion, interregional correlations were estimated while systematically increasing the number of motion\u2010affected scans included in each dataset. The AAL atlas was used to define regional GM volumetric estimates for these analyses. The previously described resampling approach was used to obtain robust estimates. Weighted correlations were estimated using the \u201cweights\u201d R package (Pasek,\u00a0 ). We used both the CAT12 weighted image quality index and average Euler number as image quality metrics. Both IQMs were inverted so that higher quality less motion\u2010affected scans had a higher score and were therefore more heavily weighted. The following interregional correlation matrices were estimated: (i) ground truth estimates derived from low\u2010motion scans, (ii) unweighted correlations derived from datasets containing motion\u2010affected scans, (iii) correlations weighted using inverted CAT12 IQMs, and (iv) correlations weighted using inverted Euler number IQMs. The region\u2010wise difference and mean absolute error (MAE) between ground truth low\u2010motion correlations and weighted/unweighted motion\u2010affected correlations was calculated. If the proposed weighted correlation approach is effective for correcting for the effects of in\u2010scanner motion, we would expect the MAE associated with weighted correlations derived from motion\u2010affected datasets to be lower than the MAE for the equivalent unweighted correlations. \n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nQuantitative assessment of image quality in the motion\u2010affected and low\u2010motion scan groups indicated substantially reduced image quality in the motion\u2010affected scans when using the weighted image quality metric from the CAT12 SPM toolbox and the Euler number derived from Freesurfer\u2010based cortical surface reconstructions (Figure\u00a0 ). The test\u2013retest reliability of structural covariance networks constructed from repeat low\u2010motion scans was high for both the VBM\u2010based AAL atlas approach and regional volume estimates obtained using Freesurfer, with an average ICC of 0.95 and 0.97, respectively. The ICC of regional cortical thickness estimates was significantly lower, with a mean ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.79. The mean ICC values and 95% confidence intervals for these estimates are shown in Figure\u00a0 . Given the lower test\u2013retest reliability of between\u2010region correlations estimated using cortical thickness estimates, all subsequent analyses on the effects of head motion used structural covariance networks derived from volumetric estimates only. \n  \nQuantitative image quality indices show that brain MRI quality is reduced (higher weighted image quality index and lower Euler number,   p  \u2009<\u2009<\u2009.001 for both analyses) in the motion\u2010affected group. Note that the   y  \u2010axis on the Euler number plot is reversed. \n    \nTest\u2013retest variability is higher (lower ICC) when constructing structural covariance networks using cortical thickness estimates compared to volumetric estimates derived from surface\u2010based (FS volume) and voxel\u2010based morphometry (VBM AAL) approaches. The 95% confidence intervals for volumetric estimates are smaller than the size of the plot labels. \n  \nAs expected from previous studies the measured GM volumetric estimates generally reduced as the number of motion\u2010affected scans included in our analyses increased (Figure\u00a0 ). The average across\u2010subject standard deviation systematically increased as the number of motion\u2010affected scans included in an analysis increased, with an increase of 1.9\u00a0\u00d7\u200910  SD per percent change in the number of motion\u2010affected scans (Figure\u00a0 ;   p  \u2009<\u2009<\u2009.001). The change in standard deviation as a function of the number of motion\u2010affected scans, both per\u2010region and averaged across all brain regions, is shown in Figure\u00a0 . For example, if 20% of the scans in a dataset were motion affected, the standard deviation increased on average by 23%. The average correlation between GM regions also systematically increased as the number of motion\u2010affected scans included increased, with an increase of 5.1\u00a0\u00d7\u200910  in   r   per percent change in the number of motion\u2010affected scans (  p  \u2009<\u2009<\u2009.001; Figure\u00a0 ). As an example, we have provided scatterplots showing the change in the correlation between the left pallidum and left inferior temporal gyrus as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increased (Figure\u00a0 ). The figure shows that the Pearson correlation increased from   r  \u00a0=\u2009.57 if no motion\u2010affected scans are included to   r  \u00a0=\u00a0.71 if six subjects (20% of the sample) are motion affected. The average threshold   r   value required to obtain adjacency matrices with the prespecified edge densities systematically increased as the number of motion\u2010affected scans included in the analyses increased; this was observed across the three target densities investigated in our study (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nThe spatial distribution of changes in measured node\u2010wise average GM volume (top row) and node\u2010wise standard deviation (bottom row) as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increases. The measured GM volume generally decreases as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increases; the standard deviation in all regions increases as the number of included motion\u2010affected scans increases. \n    \nVariability in regional gray matter volume estimates across subjects increases with the number of motion\u2010affected scans included in a dataset. The standard deviation averaged across all brain regions is shown in orange, with standard deviation in individual brain regions is shown in green. \n    \nThe correlation between gray matter volume estimates increases as the number of motion\u2010affected scans included in a dataset increases. The green line shows the average Pearson   r   across all brain regions and the dashed lines indicate the 2.5th (lower line) and 97.5th (upper line) percentiles for   N  \u00a0=\u00a05000 iterations for each setting of the number of motion\u2010affected scans \n    \nThe effect of in\u2010scanner head motion on the measured correlation in gray matter volume between the pallidum and the inferior temporal gyrus. As more motion\u2010affected scans are included in the sample, the correlation between these brain regions increases from 0.57 to 0.71. \n    \nThe threshold Pearson correlation required to obtain a predefined network edge density is dependent on the number of motion\u2010affected scans included in an analysis. \n  \nBoth modularity and efficiency systematically increased as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increased. These changes were consistent across the range of edge densities used in our analyses (Figure\u00a0 ). Small world index generally decreased as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increased, although the higher edge densities\u00a0=\u00a00.15, 0.2 showed a small peak in small world index when a low number of motion\u2010affected scans was increased. The relationship between transitivity and number of motion\u2010affected scans depended on edge density, with the shape of the density\u00a0=\u00a00.1 curve markedly different to curves for edge densities\u00a0=\u00a00.15 and 0.2. For the higher edge density values, the transitivity decreased as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increased. When examining changes in graph theoretic metrics for a single edge density\u00a0=\u00a00.15, it can be seen that the most substantial changes in transitivity, modularity, and efficiency occur when a small number of motion\u2010affected scans are included in the analysis (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nChange in graph theoretic metrics across edge density\u00a0=\u00a00.1, 0.15, 0.2. The relationship between motion and transitivity (clustering coefficient) is variable depending on the edge density used. Modularity and efficiency increase as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increases. Small world index generally decreases as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increases. The dashed lines indicate the 95% confidence interval. \n    \nChange in graph theoretic metrics as a function of in\u2010scanner motion for edge density\u00a0=\u00a00.15. For transitivity, modularity, and efficiency, the largest changes occurred when a small number of motion\u2010affected scans were included (<20%). The dashed lines indicate the 95% confidence interval \n  \nFor our analyses of the effect of internode distance on networks constructed in the presence of increasing head motion, we found that there appears to be preservation of distal connections as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increase until they comprise half of the sample, with removal of distal connections as the number of motion\u2010affected scans exceeds the number of low\u2010motion scans. This effect is subtle, however, with a maximal average shift of only ~0.5\u2009mm (see  ). \n\nWhen the number of nodes and associated node size was varied via the use of our custom parcellation scheme, the change in average within\u2010node standard deviation of GM values followed a qualitatively similar monotonic increase as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increased, independent of the number of nodes (Figure\u00a0 ). The average within\u2010node standard deviation systematically increased as the number of nodes increased. For between\u2010region correlations, the relationship between   r   and the number of motion\u2010affected scans was consistent across the different parcellations. As the number of nodes used for the parcellation scheme increased the between\u2010node correlations systematically decreased; this systematic change appears particularly large for the lower number of nodes (  n  \u00a0=\u00a0200\u2013250), but the difference was reduced when parcellations with a larger number of nodes were used; for example, there was no apparent difference in average Pearson correlation when comparing   n  \u00a0=\u00a0350 and   n  \u00a0=\u00a0400 parcellation schemes. \n  \nThe influence of different parcellation schemes on structural covariance network metrics affected by in\u2010scanner head motion. The plots show that varying the number of nodes, and associated node size, generally results in upward or downward shifts in network properties; however, the change in these properties as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increases is consistent across parcellations. \n  \nFor the graph theoretic metrics, the relationships between each metric and the number of motion\u2010affected scans were similar regardless of the parcellation scheme used. For the transitivity metrics, there was no discernable systematic relationship between the number of nodes in the parcellation and the estimated transitivity values. Modularity estimates systematically decreased as the number of nodes in the parcellation scheme increased; efficiency estimates increased as the number of nodes increased; and the small world index values decreased as the number of nodes increased. \n\nWeighting between\u2010region GM volume correlations using the CAT12 weighted image quality index or average Euler number derived from Freesurfer reduced the mean absolute error relative to unweighted correlations (Figure\u00a0 ). Although the weighted correlation analyses mitigate the effects of in\u2010scanner head motion, unsurprisingly the MAE increases for both IQMs as the number of motion\u2010affected scans included in the analysis increased. Our preliminary analyses suggest that using the average Euler number to weight the correlations has a lower MAE than the CAT12 IQM over most of the range of motion\u2010affected scans. \n  \nWeighting interregional correlations by image quality metrics derived from the CAT12 toolbox (orange line) and average Euler number derived from Freesurfer (blue line) yields correlations that more closely resemble ground\u2010truth correlations derived from low\u2010motion scans compared with unweighted correlations (green line). This suggests that errors in correlation estimates and further downstream metrics introduced by in\u2010scanner head motion may be mitigated using postprocessing techniques. \n  \n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nWe have demonstrated that the inclusion of motion\u2010affected scans in a structural covariance analysis framework causes systematic increases in the variability of measured gray matter volumes. The increase in variability subsequently increases the correlation in GM volumes between brain regions. The increases in regional variability and measured correlation between brain regions are observed across the whole brain. These findings suggest that in\u2010scanner head motion can affect the construction of networks derived from covariance of the volumes of gray matter regions across subjects. We have also shown that graph theoretic metrics derived from graphs constructed based on correlation between brain regions are dependent on the number of motion\u2010affected scans included in an analysis. Our analyses suggest that in\u2010scanner head motion is a potential source of error for structural covariance analyses and violates the primary underlying assumption that significant correlations in GM volume estimates between brain regions reflect neuroanatomical connectivity. These findings suggest that caution should be exercised when interpreting the results of structural covariance analyses. \n\nGiven that we have demonstrated that structural covariance network properties can be affected by in\u2010scanner head motion, it naturally follows that there would be interest in the development of methods for mitigating this source of error. We have provided preliminary evidence that weighting correlations using IQMs derived from the CAT12 toolbox or the average Euler number derived from Freesurfer\u2010based surface analysis yield estimates that are closer to ground\u2010truth estimates obtained using only low\u2010motion scans. Our analyses suggest that the use of average Euler number is modestly superior to the CAT12 IQM; however, more research is needed to optimize this candidate approach. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that, despite the fact that in\u2010scanner head motion systematically affects structural covariance networks, this source of error may be controlled using postprocessing methods. Additional approaches could be investigated; for example, based on the scatterplots shown in Figure\u00a0  the use of outlier detection methods such as Cook's distance or alternatives to Pearson correlation such as Spearman's rank correlation coefficient could be beneficial. As with our weighted correlation approach, these techniques may mitigate the effects of motion but they may not eliminate the effect entirely; for example, although Cook's distance may correctly identify the clear outlier shown in orange in the bottom plot of Figure\u00a0 , it may not identify more subtle systematic shifts due to head motion. A similar argument could be applied to rank\u2010based correlation methods since relative rank changes could still occur due to head motion. One approach we believe may be useful would be to match scans based on the image quality metrics presented in Figure\u00a0 ; if image quality was similar across subject groups this would suggest that the groups are matched for head motion. The methods described are speculative at this stage and further investigation is warranted. A limitation of our study is that no direct estimates of head motion were included in our analyses, primarily due to the fact that there are few widely available techniques for measuring head motion during structural MRI scans. Future studies incorporating recently proposed direct measures of head motion could be useful for the development of techniques to ameliorate this source of error (Frost et al.,\u00a0 ; Kober et al.,\u00a0 ; Maclaren et al.,\u00a0 ; Pardoe et al.,\u00a0 ; Tisdall et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nOur experimental framework used individuals who deliberately moved their heads in the MRI scanner. The motion\u2010related artifacts in these scans may be greater than those encountered in a typical clinical imaging study, particularly in studies that have stringent quality control procedures. Although quality control protocols implemented at the clinical imaging site are likely to reduce the magnitude of this source of error, it is unclear whether they would eliminate this effect. Previous studies have demonstrated that in\u2010scanner head motion in a clinical setting has a significant effect on cortical thickness and regional volume even in scans that have been visually rated as being high quality (Pardoe et al.,\u00a0 ); this suggests that it is possible that even subtle in\u2010scanner head motion could have a systematic effect on structural covariance analyses, particularly in large studies. Recently developed motion\u2010robust acquisitions (Frost et al.,\u00a0 ; White et al.,\u00a0 ) are likely to ameliorate the effects of in\u2010scanner head motion described in this work; however, these should be investigated in future studies. \n\nOne interesting finding from our analyses is the interaction between edge density and transitivity/clustering coefficient as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increases (Figure\u00a0 , top left). We suspect that this effect is due to the fact that lower density networks, for example, density\u00a0=\u00a00.1, are by definition limited to \u201cstronger\u201d node\u2010node correlations (higher   r  ) than higher density networks. The global clustering coefficient\u00a0=\u00a0Number of closed triplets/Number of all triplets\u00a0; the plot of clustering coefficient against the number motion\u2010affected scans therefore implies that the number of closed triplets in low\u2010density networks is relatively stable as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increases. For higher density networks, the number of closed triplets decreases substantially as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increases. This difference may be related to the volume of the individual nodes that comprise each triplet in the network, because the relative change in measured volume of large nodes as motion increases will be smaller than the change in volume of smaller nodes. We investigated this post hoc hypothesis by measuring the average volume of \u201crobust\u201d closed triplets, that is, those present in high motion low\u2010density networks (  N   robust triplets\u00a0=\u00a0610), versus the average volume of \u201cweak\u201d closed triplets, that is, those triplets that are present in low\u2010motion high\u2010density networks but fall out of the network as the number of motion\u2010affected scans increases (  N   weak triplets\u00a0=\u00a02899). We found that the average volume of robust closed triplets was significantly higher than weak closed triplets (Vol \u00a0=\u00a01690, Vol \u00a0=\u00a01320,   p  \u2009<\u2009<\u2009.001), which supports our hypothesis. \n\nFor our study, we limited our analysis of graph theoretic metrics to the most widely used in the literature. There are a number of additional measures and variants of existing measures that may be derived from structural covariance networks, including measures of local efficiency, path length, betweenness, closeness, and centrality. Given that all graph theoretic estimates that we investigated in our study were to some extent dependent on in\u2010scanner head motion, it is highly likely that these additional measures will also be affected. \n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that in\u2010scanner head motion systematically increases the correlation in estimates of regional gray matter volume as a consequence of increased variability in these estimates. These changes affect graph theory\u2010based metrics typically used to infer differences in neuroanatomical connectivity between subject groups. As with mass\u2010univariate analyses of regional brain volume differences between subject groups, the results of structural covariance analyses should be interpreted with the knowledge that head motion is a potential source of error. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9435006, "text_md5": "9f637498331b32ff34cb02b387fc179c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 40], "journal": [41, 55], "publication_year": [57, 61], "title": [72, 129], "keywords": [143, 196], "abstract": [209, 1945], "body": [1954, 41362], "tables": [41375, 41375]}, "batch": 19, "pmid": 35593313, "doi": "10.1002/hbm.25957", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9435006", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9435006"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9435006\">9435006</a>", "list_title": "PMC9435006  In\u2010scanner head motion and structural covariance networks"}

Although brain activation has been shown to be associated with individual differences in risk taking, the directionality of the reported brain\u2013behavior associations is less clear. Here, we argue that one aspect contributing to the mixed results is the low convergence between risk-taking measures, especially between the behavioral tasks used to elicit neural functional markers. To address this question, we analyzed within-participant neuroimaging data for two widely used risk-taking tasks collected from the imaging subsample of the Basel\u2013Berlin Risk Study (  N   = 116 young human adults). Focusing on core brain regions implicated in risk taking (nucleus accumbens, anterior insula, and anterior cingulate cortex), for the two tasks, we examined group-level activation for risky versus safe choices, as well as associations between local functional markers and various risk-related outcomes, including psychometrically derived risk preference factors. While we observed common group-level activation in the two tasks (notably increased nucleus accumbens activation), individual differences analyses support the idea that the presence and directionality of associations between brain activation and risk taking varies as a function of the risk-taking measures used to capture individual differences. Our results have methodological implications for the use of brain markers for intervention or prevention. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMany events, trajectories, and transitions central to human life are shaped by the extent to which individuals are risk loving or risk averse, particularly in the domains of health, wealth, and criminal activity ( ). Accordingly, individual differences in risk preference (as well as related constructs and constituent factors) present desirable targets for clinical, developmental, and longitudinal research aiming to identify reliable markers for the purpose of intervention and prevention ( ). Backed by a recent genome-wide association study that suggested that the genetic basis for domain-general risk taking is predominantly expressed in the brain tissue ( ), a prominent approach to understanding and, ultimately, predicting individual differences in risk taking focuses on neural pathways ( ). \n\nWhat do we know about the neural basis of risk taking that may help understand individual differences? Qualitative ( ;  ;  ;  ) and quantitative reviews ( ;  ;  ) of studies that have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine brain function in response to behavioral measures of risk point towards several brain regions of interest, converging in particular on increased activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), (anterior) insula (AIns), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as key functional correlates of risk taking. Furthermore, a large-scale term-based meta-analysis of fMRI studies ( ) also points toward increased activation in the NAcc, AIns, and ACC as   consistently   and   preferentially   associated with the term \u201crisk taking\u201d (accessed September 5, 2020).  Regarding the underlying mechanisms, these regions have been suggested to constitute the core elements of a neural   risk matrix   ( ), the differential activation in which is thought to facilitate the promotion (NAcc in ventral striatum), inhibition (AIns), and control (ACC) of risky choice. \n\nRegional brain activations in response to risky versus safe decisions alone do not necessarily reflect useful or reliable predictors for the outcomes of interest ( ), however, and instead a combination of within-participant designs and individual differences analyses is required ( ). Empirical research on neural functional markers for individual differences in risk taking and related constructs abound ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ); synthesis of the available evidence indicates heterogeneous findings for both the presence and directionality of associations between neural function and risk-related outcomes ( ). For example, risk-related brain activation in the NAcc was found to be positively and negatively associated with self-reported risk taking ( ), and despite contributing to the successful classification of risky versus safe choices ( ), risk-related AIns activation was both positively and negatively associated with risky choice ( ;  ). \n\nHow can we account for the mixed findings relating brain activation with (real-life) risk taking? One crucial aspect lies in the circumstance that much of our current understanding of the association between neural function and risk-related outcomes is synthesized across a wide range of risk-taking measures used to both elicit brain activation and define outcome measures of interest ( ). Indeed, numerous behavioral measures and self-report inventories believed to capture individual differences are available ( ;  ), yet within-participant (psychometric) designs suggest that different measures result in weakly or uncorrelated estimates of individuals\u2019 risk preferences as a likely result of their idiosyncratic recruitment of cognitive and affective processes ( ;  ;  ;  ). For example, a common distinction between behavioral measures rests on whether decision-relevant information (e.g., range and mean of probabilities, gains, and losses) is mostly unavailable and thus ambiguous, available in the form of fully described properties, or in principle available but must be learned through repeated experience. Although such ambiguity, description, and experience-based risk-taking measures, respectively, share central characteristics (e.g., the presence of uncertainty, integration of available information into a subjective value signal), they differ in the involvement of further requisite or incidental processes, including learning, attention, affect, and memory ( ;  ;  ). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the heterogeneous trajectories found for risk taking across the life span are, in parts, reflective of the way in which risk is encountered and how the relative cognitive (and affective) demands of the measures used to operationalize risk interact with age ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nIn the context of fMRI studies, recent reviews have highlighted the issue of measurement, that is, how brain markers are elicited and how risk-related outcomes of interest are assessed, as a central problem in need of clarification ( ;  ). Interestingly, even though numerous behavioral measures are used to elicit risk-related neural functional markers ( ;  ;  ;  ), only a few fMRI studies have empirically compared different measures in within-participant designs with regard to group-level brain activation and individual differences analyses ( ;  ;  ). For example, a conjunction analysis of group-level activations associated with experience-based risk taking in the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) and description-based risk taking in the Game of Dice Task ( ) revealed joint activation increases in bilateral striatal regions and insula, yet also a stronger \u201cRisky > Safe\u201d contrast in an extensive frontoparietal network for the Game of Dice Task relative to the BART, which the authors suggest reflects more reflective risk taking in the former compared with the latter task. In addition to relatively small sample sizes, however, a common shortcoming of previous fMRI studies that have used a two-task, within-participant design is the use of single indices of the risk-related outcomes that are examined for their association with neural function. \n\nHere, we investigated whether brain activation in the NAcc, AIns, and ACC elicited within participants from two popular behavioral risk-taking measures in a large sample of young adults is differentially associated with various indicators of (real-life) risk taking. In particular, we used fMRI versions of the BART ( ;  ) and monetary gambles ( ) to elicit risk-taking related neural functional markers. Importantly, both tasks feature similar concepts such as loss, reward, and risk; yet, whereas these parameters are explicitly described for monetary gambles, some must be explored and learned through experience in the BART ( ;  ). In using these two fMRI tasks, our aim is not to neurally dissociate experienced from described risk, for this question has already been addressed using well-suited and meticulously controlled experimental designs ( ). Instead, the aim of our two-task approach is to examine, at the level of brain\u2013behavior associations for two ubiquitous fMRI risk-taking tasks, what has already been shown psychometrically ( ,  ;  ), namely that risk-taking measures should not be used interchangeably. \n\nGuiding our analyses were the following research questions (RQ). RQ1: Do the two fMRI tasks elicit common group-level activation for risky versus safe decisions in   risk matrix   regions? Previous literature ( ) examining similar tasks suggests that joint activation increases could be especially evident in the striatum and insular cortex. RQ2: To what extent are functional markers positively correlated across the two fMRI measures at the level of the individual? Owing to the often-neglected lack of a match between group- and individual-level effects ( ;  ;  ), any observed convergence of group-level neural function does not necessarily indicate individual-level consistency ( ;  ;  ;  ). RQ3: To what extent do brain\u2013behavior associations change as a function of how risk-related neural activation is elicited and risk-related outcomes are assessed? Considering the ongoing debate on the nature, structure, and dimensionality of risk preference ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), how risk-related outcomes are assessed poses a challenge for associations with brain function ( ). To address this issue, first, we examined within-task brain\u2013behavior associations because this provides insight into the neural mechanisms mapping onto, and ideally giving rise to, behavior on a given task. Second, we examined the extent to which neural markers from one fMRI task were associated with performance on the other because such out-of-task associations could be suggestive of more general mechanisms being captured. Third, we investigated associations between neural function and latent measures of risk preference obtained from psychometric modeling of a large battery of risk-taking measures collected out of session. Latent variables promise to reflect more error-free and thus more reliable measures of risk preference, and by correlating these with neural indices, we can test to what extent the three   risk matrix regions   are differentially associated with more refined indices of risk preference. \n\nThe functional significance and dissociation of activation in the NAcc, AIns, and ACC for risky choice, as postulated by the   risk matrix   framework ( ), leads to the hypotheses that risk-related outcomes should be positively associated with risk-taking-related NAcc activation and negatively associated with risk-related activation in the AIns and ACC. However, to the extent that the two fMRI tasks vary on task-specific demands that may moderate brain\u2013behavior associations ( ;  ;  ;  ), we explore whether and how the resultant associations between brain function and risk-related outcomes differ from the associations expected as per the   risk matrix   framework. Intuitively, the two fMRI tasks used here differ with regard to how risk is encountered, which in turn is likely to affect attentional demands (BART > monetary gambles), affective responses (BART > monetary gambles), and feedback-based integrative processes (BART > monetary gambles), among others. However, a formal comparison of our task implementations (e.g., facilitated by a validated taxonomy of risk-taking measures) is still outstanding; in its absence, our findings will help generate focused hypotheses about the impact of task-specific aspects on brain\u2013behavior associations. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Experimental Design \n  \n#### Participant Recruitment \n  \nParticipants in this fMRI study were recruited from an existing pool of individuals who had participated in the Basel\u2013Berlin Risk Study (BBRS). The BBRS is a large-scale (  n   = 1,507) study assessing individual differences, psychometric structure, and biological underpinnings of risk preference ( ;  ;  ). Participants in the BBRS completed an extensive battery of risk-taking measures (including self-report and behavioral measures), as well as other individual differences measures, including cognitive capacity, personality, affect, and genetics (an overview of all subsamples, measures, and further details on the BBRS is reported on  ). The BBRS was run in Basel (Switzerland) and Berlin (Germany), but we recruited only individuals from the Berlin site for the imaging study due to the location of the neuroimaging facilities available. Exclusion criteria for participation in the neuroimaging study were safety-limiting permanent implants, a history of neurological or psychiatric conditions, usage of psychoactive medication or substances, and receiving psychiatric treatment. \n\nReflective of oversampling to achieve an effective sample size of   N  \u223c100 ( ) in the event of participant exclusions (e.g., due to excessive head motion in the scanner, image artifacts), we recruited a total of 133 participants. Two participants aborted the session before any functional sequences were collected and were removed from all subsequent analyses. A further five participants were excluded due to excessive head motion inside the scanner (see image preprocessing section for movement parameter thresholds), one participant due to incidental anatomical findings, four participants due to incomplete data (e.g., only one of the two risk-taking measures was completed inside the scanner), and five participants for non-compliance with the scanner protocol (e.g., falling asleep, reports of having mixed up button box responses). The final sample included in all analyses comprised 116 participants (62 females; mean age at scan = 25.34 years;   SD   = 2.64 years; range = 20.4\u201330.1 years). \n\n\n#### Experimental Procedure and Compensation \n  \nParticipants who had completed the BBRS laboratory session were contacted via phone and informed about the MRI follow-up study. Interested individuals were screened via telephone for any contraindications regarding MRI safety and invited to participate if no exclusion criteria applied. At the time of the imaging session, all individuals were screened again for contraindicators, followed by a 2-min training run for each of the two fMRI tasks (BART and monetary gambles) before entering the scanner. The scanner protocol took 75 min and included a high-resolution structural scan, two functional sequences for the BART, two functional sequences for monetary gambles, a resting-state sequence, and a diffusion-weighted imaging sequence. For the current study, only the high-resolution structural scan and the functional sequences were utilized, with the structural scan only serving normalization purposes during preprocessing of functional imaging data. The resting-state and diffusion-weighted sequences were not part of the current analysis and are not discussed further. The fMRI tasks were presented using E-Prime 2.0 software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA), and responses inside the scanner were collected via a COVILEX response box system (series 1.X, Magdeburg, Germany) using the right-hand index and middle finger. After the MRI session, individuals reported demographic data and completed additional measures (see section \u201cExperimental Measures\u201d). \n\nAt the end of the session, participants received a fixed fee of 25 Euro for their participation. In addition, participants could increase their earnings based on performance in the two fMRI tasks. For the BART, participants received 0.05 Euro for each successful pump on a balloon that was cashed out, i.e., did not explode. For monetary gambles, one trial was drawn at random and, if the participant had accepted the trial, was played out. The resulting loss or gain was combined with money made in the BART. Trials that were drawn but which the participant had rejected resulted in a 0-Euro outcome. Participants were told about the incentive structure at the start of the MRI session and received cash earnings at the end of the session (average actual payment = 41.50 Euro,   SD   = 14.50 Euro). \n\n\n#### Experimental Measures \n  \nThe fMRI session involved incentivized, performance-compatible versions of two prototypical measures of experience- and description-based risk taking ( ), which have been used in neuroimaging research and investigated extensively with regard to group-level neural activation profiles ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and individual differences ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n  \nSchematic representation of two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) risk-taking measures.   (A)   Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART),   upper row  , example cash-out trial;   lower row  , example explosion trial.   (B)   Monetary gambles. ISI, interstimulus interval; ITI, intertrial interval; s, seconds. \n  \n##### Balloon Analog Risk Task \n  \nThe BART ( ) involves a series of virtual balloons, which individuals are tasked with pumping up in the absence of knowledge about when the balloon will burst. Successful pumps (i.e., pumps that do not lead to a balloon explosion) earn the participant money, but an explosion leads to the loss of the money accumulated on the current trial. Individuals thus make repeated decisions about whether to (1) continue pumping up a balloon (i.e., risky decision), with the prospect of accumulating more money, or (2) stop pumping and cash out any accumulated earnings on a given trial (i.e., safe decision), yet foregoing any further earnings on that trial. Importantly, as individuals move from trial to trial and experience the outcome of their decisions (e.g., a balloon explosion), they can build a mental representation of explosion distributions for a given balloon type over time. The BART version implemented in the current study featured two risky balloon types and a control balloon. The maximum capacity for the two risky balloons was set to be 12 and 20 pumps, respectively; that is, on average, balloons with a capacity of 12 pumps burst earlier than balloons with a capacity of 20. Risky balloons were represented in blue and red to discriminate between balloon types based on capacity, with capacity\u2013color assignment being randomized between participants but stable across the two runs. Control balloons were presented in gray, had a maximum capacity of 16, and were added to control for neural processes that required no decision making (e.g., motor or visual). Participants merely inflated control balloons until they disappeared from the screen. On any given trial, balloon capacity was determined via a random draw from a uniform distribution of values between one and the maximum capacity for the presented balloon type. Participants completed two runs of the BART, with a short break in between. Each run was programmed to continue for 10 min, after which the final balloon was presented. Given that decisions are made sequentially and may become more difficult as the number of successful pumps in a trial increases, we did not impose a time limit on the decision phase of a given trial, resulting in the number of balloons played varying between individuals ( ). Intervals between trials and between successive stimuli within trials were randomized (mean intertrial interval = 4.39 s, range = 1\u201311 s; mean interstimulus interval = 1.5 s, range = 1\u20132 s). \n\nTo disentangle different cognitive processes underlying the observed behavior in the BART, including gain and loss sensitivity, response consistency, risk preference, or learning ( ;  ), we fitted two standard computational models: a target model that assumes a fixed strategy is being used ( ;  ) and a Bayesian sequential risk-taking model that allows for dynamic updating processes ( ). In line with past research ( ), however, the estimation of the model parameters turned out to be unreliable, and we thus do not report the modeling attempt here (a possible reason for the unreliable model parameters may be the lack of strong learning effects). Consequently, we relied on the average number of pumps as a simpler and generic index of risk preference in all subsequent analyses (apart from the mixed-effects trial-by-trial modeling of choice behavior). \n\n\n##### Monetary gambles \n  \nWe adopted a monetary gambles paradigm with mixed outcomes as an example of a description-based risk-taking measure (i.e., both gains and losses were possible) ( ;  ;  ;  ). In the current study, participants made a total of 144 decisions between a sure zero outcome and a 50/50 gamble without feedback (i.e., gamble outcomes were not presented). Individual gambles were constructed to populate an asymmetric 12 \u00d7 12 payoff matrix ( ) with gains between 10 and 32 (increments of 2) and losses between 5 and 16 (increments of 1). Each gamble was presented once, with the order of gamble presentation randomized between participants. On a given trial, once the gamble was presented, participants had 3 s to accept or reject the gamble via respective button presses. Although in previous studies participants gave responses indicating the strength of their decision ( ;  ), we collected binary responses (accept/reject) only. Considering that previously reported analyses were commonly conducted on collapsed (binary) responses ( ;  ), we did not expect a substantial benefit from adopting more fine-grained response options. Participants completed two runs with a short pause in between, each run featuring 72 gambles. Jitters were introduced between trials (mean intertrial interval = 4.32 s, range = 1\u201311 s). \n  \nRisk taking in two common behavioral measures.   (A)   Distribution of individuals\u2019 average number of pumps in the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART), shown separately for balloons with capacity 12 and 20.   (B)   Payoff matrix overlaid with heatmap showing the observed probability of gamble acceptance in monetary gambles.   (C)   Association between risk taking in the BART and monetary gambles (plotted are the standardized residuals after regressing out effects of age and gender), with variable distributions shown in the margins. \n  \nA simple model that captures sensitivity to gains versus losses has been used to capture decision making for monetary gambles ( ;  ;  ). However, the critical parameter of this model, loss aversion, was negatively correlated with the proportion of accepted gambles (  r   =   -  0.90,   p   < 0.001). Consequently, we relied on the proportion of accepted gambles as a simpler and generic index of risk preference in all subsequent analyses (apart from the mixed-effects trial-by-trial modeling of choice behavior). \n\n\n##### Psychometric risk preference factors \n  \nBehavioral measures often suffer from poor test\u2013retest reliability ( ;  ) and (accordingly) low convergence ( ;  ); thus, selecting single measures as indicators of risk preference may constrain the utility of examining associations with neural function ( ). To address this issue, we used psychometric factors that were extracted across 39 widely used risk-taking measures collected from the full BBRS sample via implementation of a bifactor model; see   for a comprehensive list of measures and details on latent variable modeling analyses. The bifactor model gave rise to a general risk preference factor,   R   (akin to the general factor of intelligence), that captured 61% of the explained variance across risk-taking measures and seven specific orthogonal factors that captured additional domain- or situation-specific variance. The domain-specific factors were suggested to represent attitudes and behaviors associated with health risk taking (F1), financial risk taking (F2), recreational risk taking (F3), impulsivity (F4), traffic risk taking (F5), occupational risk taking (F6), and choices among (monetary) lotteries (F7). For a subset of BBRS participants (n = 109), test\u2013retest reliability was higher for the psychometric factors than for behavioral measures; for example, the general risk preference factor   R   was observed to have a 6-months retest reliability of 0.85, whereas many of the behavioral measures tested yielded retest reliabilities below 0.5. \n\nDue to a temporal overlap between the end of behavioral data collection in the laboratory and the start of the MRI component, individuals were contacted with varying delays after having completed the BBRS laboratory component. As a result, the MRI sample was heterogeneous with regard to the delay between the laboratory and MRI session (mean delay = 196 days,   SD   = 121 days, range = 1\u2013453 days). Furthermore, the laboratory session of the BBRS took place prior to the MRI session; hence, we refrain from using the term \u201cprediction\u201d (in the strictest sense we could use the term \u201cpostdiction\u201d) and instead refer to our analyses as out-of-session associations. \n\n\n##### Further measures \n  \nOutside the scanner, we collected self-reported demographic data (date of birth, gender, marital status, educational attainment, native language, and current occupation). Of note, only gender and age at the MRI session (calculated from date of birth) were included as covariates in the current analyses; all other demographic measures were merely collected to describe the sample and ascertain the external validity of our findings with respect to sample characteristics. As part of an independent project, we assessed individuals\u2019 height and weight, collected data from a verbal fluency task, as well as various self-report measures of impulsivity and eating-related behaviors and attitudes; given that these measures were not part of the current analyses, we do not elaborate on these measures here. \n\n\n\n#### MRI Data Acquisition \n  \nNeuroimaging data were collected at the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Laboratory at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development (Berlin, Germany) on a 3T Siemens MRI system with 12-channel head coil. Participants were scanned with a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (repetition time = 2,500 ms, echo time = 4.77 ms, inversion time = 1,100 ms, flip angle = 7\u00b0, field of view = 256 mm \u00d7 256 mm, 192 slices, voxel size = 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm). In each of the four functional runs, up to 320 functional T2 -weighted blood\u2013oxygen-level-dependent imaging (BOLD) echo-planar images were acquired for every person (repetition time = 2,010 ms, echo time = 30 ms, flip angle = 78\u00b0, field of view = 192 mm \u00d7 192 mm, voxel size = 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm, 33 transversal slices/volume with 15% distance factor). \n\n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nAll behavioral analyses were performed in R (R Project for Statistical Computing ;  ), using the packages lme4 (lme4: linear mixed-effects models using Eigen and S4; R package v 1.1\u20138)  and lmerTest (lmerTest: tests in linear mixed effects models; R package v 2.0\u201325).  We used the functions lmer and glmer for the mixed-effects models of continuous and binary outcome variables, respectively. To obtain   p  -values for the fixed-effects test statistics in lmerTest, the calculation of the denominator degrees of freedom adopts Satterthwaite\u2019s approximation (cf. SAS proc mixed theory). \n\n#### Behavioral Analysis \n  \nTo examine whether risk taking elicited in the BART and monetary gambles mirrored behavioral patterns observed in the literature ( ;  ;  ), we assessed group-level behavior and performed analyses ascertaining and accounting for the effect of individual as well as contextual variables. The outcome variable typically used in the BART to reflect individuals\u2019 risk preference is the average number of pumps administered on cash-out trials only ( ;  ;  ), also referred to as the adjusted average number of pumps. In line with previous research ( ;  ), the adjusted average number of pumps was highly correlated with the average number of pumps across all balloons (  r   = 0.97,   p   < 0.001) as well as for the two balloon capacities separately (  r   = 0.92,   p   < 0.001,   r   = 0.95,   p   < 0.001). Given these results, we used the average number of pumps across all balloons as outcome variable in the BART because it allowed us to retain a maximum number of trials for analysis while working with congruent trial numbers in both neural and behavioral analyses. We dropped the gray control balloons from all behavioral analyses of the BART, as these balloons did not require a choice to be made and are thus uninformative for determining effects on (risky) choice. \n\nTo assess whether the experimental manipulation of balloon capacity elicited different risk-taking behavior, we compared the mean number of pumps between balloons with a capacity of 12 and 20 by means of a two-sample paired   t  -test with significance level of   p   < 0.05. In order to estimate the effect of individual and contextual factors on trial-by-trial risky choice, we applied mixed-effects regression analysis. We regressed the number of pumps on reward balloons (for a given trial) on trial-specific fixed effects of balloon capacity as a proxy for the level of risk (0 = 12, 1 = 20), having experienced an explosion on the previous trial (0 = no, 1 = yes), and trial number (continuous). We also included individual differences in age (continuous) and gender (0 = male, 1 = female) in the regression model. To account for individual differences to specific contextual factors, we allowed for random slopes for balloon capacity, trial number, and explosion on the previous trial. Prior to fitting the regression model, all continuous predictor variables were standardized (i.e., centered and scaled by the standard deviation) and categorical variables were dummy coded. The specification of the regression model and selection of predictor variables followed previously reported trial-level effects ( ;  ). \n\nFor monetary gambles, we computed the proportion of accepted gambles out of all gambles for which a response was provided as an index of risk taking. In a first step, we used this index to compute the probability of an \u201cAccept\u201d decision for a given option for the entire sample. In a second step, we specified a logistic mixed-effects model, in which the decision to accept or reject (0 = Reject, 1 = Accept) a particular lottery in a given trial was regressed on fixed trial-specific effects of the magnitude of the gain, the absolute magnitude of the loss, the interaction between gain and loss, and individual effects of age (continuous) and gender (0 = male, 1 = female). In the regression model, we allowed random slopes for gain and loss magnitude. All continuous predictor variables were standardized prior to fitting the model, and categorical variables were dummy coded. Model specification was informed by previously reported trial-level effects ( ). Given differential effects of age and gender on trial-by-trial decision making, we conducted all subsequent analyses on standardized and residualized (i.e., regressing out effects of age and gender) behavioral indices. As a final step in the behavioral analysis, we computed the correlation between mean number of pumps in the BART and proportion of accept decisions in monetary gambles to ascertain the convergence of experience- and description-based risk taking ( ). \n\n\n#### Neuroimaging Analysis \n  \nImage preprocessing and analyses were carried out using standard procedures implemented in SPM8.  See   for details. \n\n##### fMRI model specification \n  \nAt the level of the individual, we concatenated the two runs for each of the two risk-taking measures and specified one general linear model for the BART and one for monetary gambles. Our aim was to target and compare the neural representation of risky versus safe decisions in both measures, which we operationalized as decisions to administer a pump on reward balloons in the BART and decisions to accept a lottery in monetary gambles. For the main contrast of interest\u2014risky versus safe decisions\u2014we followed standard approaches and contrasted pumping on reward balloons with pumping on control balloons (\u201cPumps reward versus Pumps control\u201d) in the BART ( ;  ;  ) and contrasted decisions to accept a lottery with decisions to reject (\u201cAccept versus Reject\u201d) in monetary gambles ( ). We considered rejection of a gamble the safe option because by rejecting a gamble, participants implicitly opted for a sure outcome of zero. \n\nTo facilitate contrast analyses that tackle RQ1, the individual-level BART GLM included eight regressors (  for an example individual-level design matrix). We included onset vectors for control, low-capacity, and high-capacity balloons and one onset vector for cash-out events and one onset vector for explosion events (in that order). For each balloon onset vector, we also included a parametric regressor number to facilitate supplementary analyses to better understand the impact of contrast choice on BART brain\u2013behavior associations ( ). Cash-out and explosion events were included to account for additional variance and thus better isolate the main effects of interest by removing neural responses to cash out and explosions from baseline activity. Six motion parameters estimated during the realignment procedure were included as regressors of no interest. The individual-level GLM for monetary gambles included the following regressors: onset vector for all Accept decisions, onset vector for all Reject decisions, and six motion parameters estimated during the realignment procedure (  for example individual-level design matrix). Multicollinearity between choice and gain/loss magnitudes (and as a consequence, also the expected value of a gamble) reduced the scope of the design matrix. However, the simplicity of the paradigm allowed for this comparatively straightforward design matrix with only two regressors of interest, nevertheless yielding clean (event-unrelated) baseline activity. All analyses involved modeling the time from trial onset (i.e., display of stimulus) until choice (i.e., pump reward/pump control in the BART and accept/reject for monetary gambles). \n\nAt the level of the group, we specified two one-sample   t  -tests, one for every measure, in which we tested whether the group-level signal in response to risky versus safe decisions (as operationalized at the level of the individual design matrix) was significantly different from zero, controlling for the effects of age and gender (see   for contrast weights). Whole-brain, voxel-wise analyses of group-level activation in the two measures was corrected using family-wise error (FWE) correction at voxel (i.e., peak) level, with a significance level of   p   < 0.05. \n\n\n##### Regions of interest \n  \nTo avoid inflated brain\u2013behavior associations that would result from selecting regions of interest (ROIs) based on within-experiment contrast activations ( ;  ), we selected ROIs   a priori   on the basis of a comprehensive literature review and term-based meta-analysis (see section \u201cIntroduction\u201d). We used the Hammersmith atlas nr30r83  to structurally localize the ROIs for the NAcc (volume across left and right hemisphere = 114 voxels) and ACC (volume across left and right hemisphere = 2,660 voxels). In the absence of a validated structural parcelation of the insular cortex, but given our specific focus on the anterior insula, we created an anterior insula ROI (volume across left and right hemisphere = 358 voxels) based on a published meta-analysis of resting-state-based functional connectivity studies ( ); see   for details about the construction of the AIns ROI. The resulting ROIs for NAcc, AIns, and ACC are depicted in   and at the top of  . \n  \nWhole-brain voxel-wise group-level activation for risky versus safe decisions in two functional MRI (fMRI) tasks and their intersection.   (A)   Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) brain activation [peak-level family-wise error (FWE),   p   < 0.05] for \u201cPumps reward versus Pumps control\u201d. Red\u2013yellow areas represent increased activation, blue\u2013green areas represent decreased activation.   (B)   Monetary gambles brain activation (peak-level FWE,   p   < 0.05) for \u201cAccept versus Reject\u201d. Red areas represent increased activation (no significant reverse effect).   (C)   Regions of interest (ROIs). Colors correspond to the following ROIs: blueish green for NAcc, reddish purple for AIns, and yellow for ACC.   (D)   Intersection of increased activation associated with risky versus safe decisions in the BART (Pumps reward > Pumps control) and monetary gambles (Accept > Reject). Given our focus on   risk matrix   regions, in dark orange, we show intersecting increased activation for regions of interest only (small volume correction, peak-level FWE,   p   < 0.05). Shown in light orange are neural regions with intersecting increased activation at the level of the whole brain (peak-level FWE correction,   p   < 0.05). \n    \nWithin-session individual differences. Scatterplots show associations between neural indices, as well as between neural and behavioral indices. Columns represent neural signal extracted from three ROIs [anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula (AIns), and nucleus accumbens (NAcc), in that order]; rows represent analyses.   (A)   Associations between regional neural signals across measures (brain\u2013brain).   (B)   Within-measure brain\u2013outcome associations for Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART).   (C)   Within-measure brain\u2013outcome associations for monetary gambles.   (D)   Out-of-measure brain\u2013outcome associations.   Note:   All variables were regressed on age and gender and standardized prior to plotting and analysis. Regression slopes were estimated using robust regression analyses. \n  \nFor each ROI, we extracted the mean of the regression slopes from each individual\u2019s first-level BART contrast \u201cPumps reward > Pumps control\u201d and monetary gambles contrast \u201cAccept > Reject\u201d; mean signal for a particular ROI was operationalized as the mean of all regression slopes extracted from all voxels contained in a given ROI. As we had no hypotheses about hemispheric differences in the NAcc, AIns, and ACC, we computed a mean signal across the two hemispheres for each ROI, yielding six summary indices for ROI activation for each participant (i.e., three per fMRI task). High positive correlations between signal extracted from the left and right hemisphere for NAcc (  r   = 0.95,   r   = 0.88), AIns (  r   = 0.72,   r   = 0.90), and ACC (  r   = 0.94,   r   = 0.97) validated the use of a mean signal. \n\n\n##### Conjunction analysis of group-level activation between tasks \n  \nTo examine the intersection of neural markers between the two fMRI tasks at group level (RQ1), we conducted a voxel-wise conjunction analysis of activation for risky versus safe decisions in the BART (pumping on reward relative to control balloons) and monetary gambles (accepting relative to rejecting an offer). Specifically, we performed a conjunction analysis over two orthogonal contrasts that tested the conjunction\u2014rather than the global\u2014null hypothesis, allowing us to infer a conjunction of two effects (risky versus safe in BART and monetary gambles) at significant voxels ( ). For this purpose, we (1) masked the two contrasts with an inclusive   risk matrix   mask containing bilateral NAcc, AIns, and ACC ROIs (volume = 3,132 voxels), (2) applied a small volume correction at peak-level FWE,   p   < 0.05 to each of the two contrasts, and (3) computed the conjunction (i.e., intersection) of the two masked, small-volume corrected contrasts. To examine whether regions outside of the   risk matrix   showed joint activation increases in the two measures, we computed an exploratory conjunction analysis across the entire brain (peak-level FWE correction,   p   < 0.05). We used the Multi-image Analysis GUI Mango  to visualize group-level activation and their intersection on a standard group template in the MNI space. We report the coordinates of local maxima in the MNI space (mm). Anatomical labels for neural regions were obtained from the Neuromorphometrics atlas implemented in SPM8. \n\n\n##### Individual differences analyses \n  \nTurning to our output models, we performed individual differences analyses to understand the extent to which neural activation in   risk matrix   regions was preserved across measures (RQ2) and significantly linked to risk-related outcomes, including within-session behavior in the two fMRI tasks, as well as out-of-session associations with risk preference factors (RQ3). All individual-differences analyses were conducted for residualized neural and behavioral indices, that is, after regressing out effects of age and gender. Initial plotting of the mean beta values indicated relatively normally distributed mean signals for both measures, except for a small number of possible outliers ( ) for signals extracted for the ACC from the BART contrast, as well as for the ACC and AIns from monetary gambles. To estimate the biasing effect of these outliers, we computed robust regression analyses (\u201crlm\u201d function in R package MASS using method \u201cMM\u201d) ( ) and computed the correlation between the beta coefficients for the neural predictors. The beta coefficients obtained from standard and robust regression analysis correlated highly (  r   = 0.97,   p   < 0.001), but further inspection of the coefficients suggested meaningful discrepancies for models which included BART ACC activation or monetary gambles ACC and AIns activation. To obtain robust results, we computed and report Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients for all individual-differences analyses. \n\nTo control for the number of individual differences analyses, we used FWE correction and specified the following four test families for our within-session ROI analyses: (1) brain\u2013brain associations, (2) brain\u2013behavior associations for the BART (RQ3), (3) brain\u2013behavior associations for monetary gambles, and (4) brain\u2013behavior associations across the two measures. We computed three tests per family, one per ROI (cf.  ), resulting in a corrected significance level of   p   < 0.017. For the out-of-session associations between task activation and the BBRS risk preference factors, we defined six test families (one per ROI/fMRI task contrast) comprising eight tests each. This resulted in a corrected significance level of   p   = 0.05/8 = 0.00625; we report which of the results fall below the FWE-corrected significance threshold. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Risk-Taking Behavior in the BART and Monetary Gambles \n  \nInitial analyses were carried out to examine if risk-taking behavior elicited by the two fMRI tasks was comparable to behavioral patterns observed in previous studies. Confirming the experimental manipulation of reward balloon capacity in the BART ( ), the average number of pumps was significantly higher for high-capacity balloons compared to low-capacity balloons (  t   = 7.28,   p   < 0.001, mean difference = 1.05, Cohen\u2019s   d   = 0.80; see   for additional descriptive statistics). Mixed-effects modeling analyses confirm this aggregate pattern and reveal individual as well as task-specific effects on the decision to take a risk: On a given trial in the BART, the number of pumps was higher for male gender, high-capacity balloons, and no explosion on the previous trial ( ). There was no overall effect of trial number on pumping behavior. As illustrated by the heatmap in  , decisions in monetary gambles were influenced in the expected direction by the magnitude of gains and losses: Accept probabilities were highest for high gain\u2013low loss options (lower right quadrant), lowest for low gain\u2013high loss options, and in between for high gain\u2013high loss and low gain\u2013low loss options (see also   for additional descriptive statistics). Results from the mixed-effects logistic regression model for monetary gambles suggest that acceptance of a risky gamble was more likely for higher participant age, male gender, higher gain, and lower (absolute) loss ( ). \n\nOverall, the behavioral patterns observed in the BART and monetary gambles are in line with previous findings ( ;  ;  ;  ). At the level of the group, the two behavioral indices of interest, i.e., standardized residual mean number of pumps (across balloon capacities) in the BART and the standardized residual proportion of Accept decisions for monetary gambles, were approximately normally distributed (see margins in  ). The association between mean number of pumps in the BART and the proportion of Accept decisions in monetary gambles was negative and not statistically significantly (  r   = -0.16,   p   = 0.09;  ). That behavior in the two tasks was not correlated did not result from aggregating the two runs to compute one behavioral index for each measure because risky choice was relatively consistent over the two runs in the BART (  r   = 0.62,   p   < 0.001) and monetary gambles (  r   = 0.84,   p   < 0.001). \n\n\n### Group-Level Activation for Risky Versus Safe Decisions in BART and Monetary Gambles \n  \nTo address RQ1, we first computed voxel-wise whole-brain group-level task activations for each measure separately in order to (1) examine if the current implementation of the BART and monetary gambles resulted in group-level task activations comparable with previous research and (2) understand the neural basis on which we performed all subsequent analyses. Initial analyses for the BART yielded no group-level activation differences for the contrast \u201cPumps reward > Pumps control\u201d between low (12) and high (20) capacity balloons [whole-brain peak-level family-wise error correction (FWE),   p   > 0.05]; as a result, we collapsed events across capacity. For the BART, contrasting pumps on reward balloons with pumps on control balloons revealed several areas of widespread activation differences (whole-brain peak-level FWE,   p   < 0.05) including increased activation for pumping on reward relative to control balloons in a large cortical cluster (  k   = 43,995) encompassing the bilateral supplementary motor cortex, cingulate cortex, and middle segment of the superior frontal gyrus and anterior insula (  for peak coordinates and test statistics). Plotting of this contrast also highlighted the striatum as an area of increased activation ( , red\u2013yellow gradient). We also observed several large voxel clusters indicating decreased activation for pumping on reward relative to control balloons ( ), including a large cluster (  k   = 38,440) spanning the angular gyrus, precuneus, and posterior insula, as well as clusters in medial frontal cortex and lateral orbital gyrus ( , blue\u2013green gradient). For monetary gambles, contrasting accept with reject decisions revealed increased activation (\u201cAccept > Reject\u201d) in the striatum (caudate), angular gyrus, and inferior occipital gyrus but no reverse (\u201cAccept < Reject\u201d) effects (whole-brain peak-level FWE,   p   < 0.05) (  and  ). Overall, the whole-brain group-level activations associated with risky choice in the BART and monetary gambles in this study reflect group-level results reported in previous studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Conjunction of Group-Level Activation Between Tasks \n  \nOn the basis of our group-level analyses suggesting activation to be predominantly observed for contrasts targeting increased activation for risky versus safe options ( ), we investigated the intersection of the contrasts \u201cPumps reward > Pumps control\u201d in the BART and \u201cAccept > Reject.\u201d Restricting our analyses to   risk matrix   regions ( ), a conjunction analysis of group-level activation in the BART and in monetary gambles revealed a common, locally restricted signal in the NAcc (small volume correction, peak-level FWE,   p   < 0.05;  , orange region), as well as a very small region in ACC. Referring back to RQ1, opting for the risky option thus seems to elicit group-level measure-invariant neural signals in NAcc and partly ACC but not the insula. Exploratory analyses outside of   risk matrix   regions revealed a more extensive overlap of increased activation, especially in cortical areas and striatum (whole-brain peak-level FWE,   p   < 0.05;  , light orange regions). Next, we conducted individual-level analyses to investigate whether neural function associated with risky choice in   risk matrix   regions was preserved across the two fMRI tasks and to examine their explanatory power within and out of measure, as well as within and out of session. \n\n\n### Correlations Between Tasks in Canonical Activations \n  \nIn the first set of within-session analyses targeting RQ2, we assessed whether activation associated with risky versus safe decisions in   risk matrix   regions was preserved (i.e., positively correlated) across the two fMRI tasks. Although behaviorally the two measures did not correlate, it is nevertheless possible that activation in individual neural regions shows (relatively) higher convergence, for instance as a function of shared cognitive or affective components. As illustrated by the scatterplots in  , we obtained mixed results. NAcc activation in the BART was positively associated with NAcc activation in monetary gambles (\u03c1 = 0.22,   p   = 0.02), but this result was insignificant after FWE correction (  p   < 0.017). Correlation coefficients for mean activation in ACC and AIns were negative and not significant; that is, mean activation was not preserved between measures (\u03c1 = -0.14,   p   = 0.14; \u03c1 = -0.17,   p   = 0.08, respectively). The overall pattern of results was not influenced by BART contrast analysis (  and  ). In summary, our analyses to address RQ2 suggest that, although at group level the two measures converged (albeit with limited spatial extent), individual differences were not (significantly) positively correlated across measures: we found some group- but not individual-level consistency for experience- and description-based risk taking ( ). \n\n\n### Correlations Between Task Activation and Task Behavior \n  \nIn a second set of within-session analyses targeting RQ3, we examined whether activation in   risk matrix   regions was associated with behavior, both within measure (i.e., with neural and behavioral indices originating from the same fMRI task) and out of measure (i.e., neural index from one fMRI task and behavioral index from the other fMRI task). In particular, we examined the extent to which neural indices extracted from (1) BART were associated with mean number of pumps (within measure), (2) monetary gambles were associated with proportion of accepted gambles (within measure), and (3) BART were associated with proportion of accepted gambles in monetary gambles (out of measure). Given the temporal order of the two measures, we did not test whether neural signal in monetary gambles accounted for BART behavior. \n\nAs shown in  , we obtained significant (after FWE correction,   p   < 0.017) negative associations for the BART between the mean number of pumps and mean activation in ACC (\u03c1 = -0.26,   p   < 0.01) and NAcc (\u03c1 = -0.24,   p   = 0.01) but not AIns (\u03c1 = -0.2,   p   = 0.03). For monetary gambles ( ), ROI analyses revealed significant (after FWE correction) within-task negative associations between the proportion of Accept decisions and neural activation in ACC (\u03c1 = -0.37,   p   < 0.001), AIns (\u03c1 = -0.52,   p   < 0.001), and NAcc (\u03c1 = -0.42,   p   < 0.001). To put these findings into context, the within-task associations between risky choice and ACC activation obtained for both the BART and monetary gambles are in line with expectations based on the   risk matrix   framework, as is the direction of associations based on insula activation. The observed negative associations between NAcc and risky choice confirm some previous findings ( ;  ) but run counter to others ( ;  ); we return to this dissociation in the discussion. For the final set of within-session analyses, we observed no significant out-of-measure associations between the proportion of Accept decisions in monetary gambles and BART activation in ACC (\u03c1 = 0.07,   p   = 0.47), AIns (\u03c1 = 0.02,   p   = 0.79), or NAcc (\u03c1 = -0.03,   p   = 0.76) ( ). \n\nTo summarize, analyses targeting RQ2 suggest that region-specific risk-related activation was not or only marginally preserved between the BART and monetary gambles, suggesting measure-specific processing at the level of the individual. Moreover, analyses targeting the within-session aspect of RQ3 suggest that, although the current neural markers associated with risky choice can account for some behavior within fMRI task, they do not manage to cross a vital barrier for prediction and ultimately application, namely, out-of-measure associations. One possible explanation for this pattern could be our choice of outcome, that is, the use of summary behavioral indices stemming from a single fMRI task. To address this potential shortcoming, we investigated the out-of-session explanatory power of neural indices for psychometrically derived risk preference factors. \n\n\n### Correlations Between Task Activation and Risk Preference Factors \n  \nPearson correlation coefficients between the psychometric risk preference factors ( ) were comparable to the correlation coefficients observed in the full BBRS sample ( ). The main analysis to address the between-session aspect of RQ3 involved a set of Spearman correlation analyses between the risk preference factors and the neural markers extracted from three ROIs for each of the two measures\u2019 main contrast. All analyses were performed on residuals (i.e., after regressing out effects of age and gender). As illustrated in  , the majority of analyses between neural markers associated with risky choice and risk preference factors resulted in non-significant (  p   > 0.05) correlation coefficients close to 0 (mean  = 0.001, median = -0.001, range = -0.21\u20130.23;  ). Separating these results by factor and ROI, we observed a pattern of notable exceptions: the domain-specific risk preference factors, F2 (financial risk taking) and F4 (impulsivity) consistently returned correlation coefficients with the highest (absolute) magnitude for neural markers from both BART and monetary gambles ( ; see   for results from additional BART contrast analyses). Interestingly, the directionality of associations differed for the two tasks. For monetary gambles, financial risk taking correlated negatively with risk-related activation in NAcc (\u03c1 = -0.17,   p   = 0.069), ACC (\u03c1 = -0.18,   p   = 0.05) and AIns (\u03c1 = -0.21,   p   = 0.03), whereas impulsivity correlated positively with risk-related activation in NAcc (\u03c1 = 0.23,   p   = 0.02) and ACC (\u03c1 = 0.18,   p   = 0.049). For the BART, risk-related activation in ACC correlated positively with financial risk taking (\u03c1 = 0.23,   p   = 0.013), and AIns activation correlated negatively with impulsivity (\u03c1 = -0.21,   p   = 0.023). However, none of these associations survive FWE corrections (all   p   > 0.00625). We turn to the implications of the current results in the discussion. \n  \nBasel\u2013Berlin Risk Study (BBRS) risk preference factors and association with neural markers of risky choice.

Based on two popular behavioral measures of risk taking\u2014the BART and monetary gambles\u2014our results suggest limited functional convergence in neural risk matrix regions at both group and individual levels, on the one hand, and mixed results concerning brain\u2013behavior associations for single performance indices as well as for psychometrically derived risk preference factors on the other. That different measures of risk taking elicit different choices has previously been discussed, both at the level of behavior ( ;  ;  ) and their neural correlates ( ;  ;  ). Indeed, the (behavioral) differences observed across the life span between measures of experienced and described risk (of which the BART and monetary gambles are respective examples) have led to the proposition of an affect-based model of adolescent risk taking ( ). However, very few empirical studies have benefited from some of the major strengths of our work, including a large sample size, within-participant design,   a priori   defined ROIs, and a mixture of group and individual difference analyses aimed specifically at addressing issues of convergent validity and explanatory power (i.e., brain\u2013behavior associations) within and across behavioral measures of risk taking. A further main strength of this study is its link to the BBRS, which allowed us to use latent variables capturing the psychometric structure of risk preference as outcome variables for brain\u2013behavior associations. \n\nMirroring previous reports of joint group-level activation increases in bilateral striatal regions for risky versus safe options in the BART and a Game of Dice task ( ), our conjunction results in NAcc support the notion of a measure-invariant core neural signal of choice across risk-taking measures ( ). The striatum in general is a central structure implicated in reward processing ( ;  ); to the extent that risk taking is driven by the motivation to achieve a reward ( ), striatal activation is a common neural correlate of risk taking ( ). However, it has been suggested that attention plays an important role for activation especially in the ventral striatum (and thus to a large extent the NAcc), perhaps even independently of the anticipated rewards ( ). Thus, although our contrast analyses for BART and monetary gambles both resulted in increased activation in the NAcc, the underlying source of the signal may be differentially driven by attentional demands. Moreover, the ventral striatum is also implicated in the coding of prediction error ( ), which may suggest a functional convergence on monitoring of the   status quo  . Unfortunately, the two fMRI tasks used here do not allow us to disentangle these different signal sources. However, to observe a conjunction of increased NAcc activation for the two risk-taking measures at the level of the group despite the many differences between the two measures is encouraging. \n\nThe observed group-level activation in AIns for the BART, but not monetary gambles, supports the argument that experience-based measures involve potentially more affective and motivational processes compared with description-based measures ( ;  ;  ). The AIns is heavily implicated in signaling subjective feelings and explicit motivation ( ) and is thought to inhibit risky choice ( ). In this study, the BART, but not monetary gambles, involved choice feedback, which may have led to the observed neural dissociation in AIns. Indeed, the insular cortex was a further source of common activation in previous comparative work, where both the experience- and description-based measures included feedback between choices ( ). Thus, while there may be core regions associated with risk preference, some, like the NAcc, may be more core than others, depending on the measure used. Crucially, the limited regional overlap of group-level activation patterns reported here and previously ( ) is not an artifact of the contrast analysis targeting a summary decision signal for risky versus safe decisions; similar findings were obtained for more targeted components such as value or the probability of incurring a loss ( ). \n\nPast work has made clear that group averages are not necessarily reflective of individual-level behavioral ( ;  ;  ) or neural patterns ( ;  ). We found that a group-level activation increase for risky versus safe decisions was localized in the NAcc for both fMRI tasks, yet NAcc, AIns, and ACC activation was not (significantly) positively correlated between the two tasks. While the fMRI tasks used here differed on many aspects aside from whether risk was experienced or described, previous research ( ) with carefully matched task implementations has shown that outcome probability correlated more strongly with activity in ACC for experienced but AIns for described risk. In other words, the same choice component can indeed be represented differently as a function of the task. One explanation may be found in the low test\u2013retest reliability of fMRI signal elicited with reward-based decision making tasks ( ); a highly variable brain signal creates a bottleneck for the extent to which activations from different tasks correlate within subject (or with external variables), even in canonical risk-taking regions like NAcc, AIns, and ACC. \n\nTurning to our brain\u2013behavior associations, it has been suggested that experience-based risk-taking measures such as the BART are ecologically more valid exactly because the sequential nature and exposure to outcomes elicits stronger affective responses ( ;  ;  ). Whether this translates into stronger brain\u2013behavior associations, however, is an open empirical question. Although our results revealed significant brain\u2013behavior associations within fMRI task for both BART and monetary gambles, we observed larger effect sizes [i.e., higher (absolute) correlation coefficients] for activation extracted from monetary gambles compared with BART. Importantly, our supplementary analyses suggest that our findings are not tied to a particular BART contrast analysis. Instead, the observed differences in brain\u2013behavior associations may arise as a result of varying task demands ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). For example, if the sequential (feedback-based) aspect of the BART involves more attention than the descriptive aspect of monetary gambles, and if attention can drive signal in the ventral striatum, perhaps even independently of anticipated rewards ( ), then one hypothesis may be that the contribution of attentional demand to NAcc signal attenuates brain\u2013behavior associations for external variables that assume a link based on reward sensitivity. Pinning down the mechanisms that give rise to NAcc signal in different tasks will directly inform our expectations for brain\u2013behavior associations. \n\nFurthermore, the reliability of the brain signal itself may also attenuate brain\u2013behavior associations ( ). For example, reliable group- and individual-level risk-related activation has been reported for the BART, especially in canonical regions ( ;  ). However, the reported reliability estimates are based on BART implementations that included only one type of balloon, and as our behavioral analyses suggested, balloon capacity affects risk-taking behavior. Thus, certain BART implementations may reduce test\u2013retest reliability, which in turn constrains the extent to which strong brain\u2013behavior associations can be expected. \n\nConcerning the directionality of associations between risk-related neural function and outcomes, our negative brain\u2013behavior associations for AIns and ACC are in line with proposed functional dissociations, whereby more affect-based inhibition and control-related processes are associated with less risk taking ( ;  ). The observed negative association(s) between NAcc activation and risky choice within task mirror(s) previous results suggestive of a compensatory link between hyporesponsiveness of dopamine-modulated brain regions in the reward circuit and risk-related or impulsive behaviors ( ;  ). However, existing studies that have focused on brain\u2013behavior associations for (reward and/or risk-related) NAcc activation have reported both positive and negative associations ( ;  ). For neural markers elicited with the same fMRI task ( ;  ;  ), different directionalities may provide candidate mechanisms for how relative NAcc activation in anticipation of reward from generic (e.g., points, money) versus phenotype-specific (e.g., drug paraphernalia) cues underpin the initiation and trajectory of pathological risk taking (e.g., substance use). In contrast, for neural markers elicited with different fMRI tasks, opposing directionality for brain\u2013behavior associations may harbor effects of task-specific parameters, including attentional demands, the presence of ambiguity, or the exact loss function ( ;  ;  ). \n\nInterestingly, brain\u2013behavior associations for specific kinds of risk taking, as operationalized by the domain-specific risk preference factors, revealed the highest absolute (albeit non-significant after FWE correction) correlations for the factors F2 (financial risk taking) and F4 (impulsivity) but with differing directions for BART and monetary gambles. The negative associations between NAcc, AIns, and ACC activation in monetary gambles and the proportion of Accept decisions (within task) as well as F2 (out of task) may point toward the monetary aspect of both outcome variables as a potential mechanism, yet we did not observe similar associations with F7 (choices in monetary lotteries). In turn, the negative association between F4 and BART AIns activation follows research highlighting the role of the AIns for incentivized inhibition ( ), yet at the same time underlines the role of the task considering that we found no association between AIns activation in monetary gambles and F4. To the extent that the BART assesses impulsive risk taking, and description-based gambles tap more into reflective risk taking ( ), these findings provide informative starting points for future research on phenotypes with strong links to impulsivity, such as addiction ( ). \n\nOur study has some limitations worth addressing. First, we analyzed data from two fMRI tasks as prototypical examples of experienced and described risk, limiting generalization. However, research suggests that other risk-taking measures do not fare much better regarding behavioral consistency ( ), thus would probably not yield higher convergence at group or individual level. Implementing additional measures based on experienced ( ;  ) and described risk ( ) could nevertheless address questions such as whether the convergence of measures is overall higher for experienced or described risk and within the respective classes of experienced versus described risk. On a related note, implementations of decision-theoretic models of risky choice do not fare much better with regard to convergence of computationally derived parameters ( ); thus, we do not expect the overall pattern of results to be substantially different for latent performance-related outcome variables instead of the simpler behavioral indices used here for BART and monetary gambles. \n\nSecond, our results do not speak to the neural correlates of specific decision components or motivational factors, including reward, uncertainty, variance, or probability (of incurring a loss). In part, this is a limitation for contrast analyses that average activation over particular events (e.g.,   Pump   or   Accept   decisions), and one way to disentangle different components is to use parametric analyses that map neural activation to specific functional forms, such as increases in reward or probability of loss. However, standard implementations of the BART, such as the one used here and elsewhere ( ;  ;  ), do not allow for the isolation of these signals even with parametric analyses because reward and probability of loss increase monotonically over a given trial, that is, many individually contributing decision components are confounded. However, it should also be noted that reward and the probability of loss are correlated in many real-world domains ( ). Similarly, the current implementation of monetary gambles, although following on from previous studies ( ;  ), is unsuitable for investigating the effect of probability (because this was kept constant across trials) or dissecting the effects of choice-motivating aspects such as variance, expected value, gains, and losses (because these are confounded). Whether disentangling and comparing specific choice-related components (e.g., value, probability of loss) achieves a more successful mapping of the neural correlates of risk taking between different measures, and also whether this would result in successful out-of-measure brain\u2013behavior associations, is an empirical question. \n\nA third and related limitation stems from the temporal characteristics of the two measures used. The current implementations do not allow us to incontrovertibly dissociate different decision stages, such as the separation of reward anticipation and decision. Previous studies have focused predominantly on neural signals associated with the anticipation of rewards, showing the signal\u2019s potential for prediction ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, other studies have focused on the neural signal associated with actual choice or receipt of an outcome, also showing potential of the signal for explaining individual differences in risk and ambiguity preferences ( ). Returning to the point of understanding our measures better, it would be exceptionally useful to make more principled decisions about which measure to use and which decision stage for a given measure isolates the most informative neural signal for brain\u2013behavior associations. \n\nFourthly, our design is prey to order effects because we opted for a fixed task order. Randomization would have required splitting the sample into two groups based on order, thus reducing power; however, risky choice was relatively consistent across the two runs for each measure, plus the overall level of observed risk taking in the BART and monetary gambles as well as group-level neural activation was comparable to previous independent investigations ( ;  ). Taken together, our behavioral and neural results for the individual measures do not indicate major order effects. \n\nMany longitudinal, clinical, and developmental research designs focus on risk preference as a critical predictor or outcome, often aiming to establish links between individual differences in risk preference and neural function ( ;  ;  ;  ). Such endeavors are undoubtedly commendable and have the scope to be hugely beneficial for individuals and societies, but it is currently unclear to what extent previous results vary as a function of the measures used to operationalize risk taking and indeed what the best operationalizations are to isolate (neural) targets for prediction. To be clear, we   do not   advocate that neural markers have no predictive validity, in general or for risk preference, neither do we ignore the complexity of the phenotype under investigation. We simply wish to highlight the challenges ahead and open the discourse by empirically comparing two widely and often interchangeably used risk-taking measures, in particular their potential for brain\u2013behavior associations. \n\nBased on our results, we make the following recommendation for future work. First and foremost, we are hopeful that our findings motivate further research into the nature and assessment of risk preference, risk-taking behavior, and their neural underpinnings. We still know comparatively little about how the brain integrates different aspects of a decision situation under uncertainty, especially when this is laden with incidental or contextual variables such as affect or prior experience ( ;  ). To this end, it may be indispensable to develop novel and representative behavioral measures ( ) that facilitate the disentangling of risk-related cognitive and affective processes. Second, the assumption of generalizability from group to individuals is often not backed up by empirical evidence, posing a threat for individual studies and also research involving human subjects in general ( ). To successfully target individual differences in risk taking and understand the biological underpinnings, a switch is required\u2014especially within neuroscience\u2014from group- to individual-level research ( ;  ) and from single- to multimeasure research ( ). As a third and final recommendation, we call for greater transparency in the reporting of how and why risk-taking measures were selected for a given research study. This will not only lead to more principled decisions during the research design stage but hopefully push the research community toward establishing a much-needed taxonomy of measures and their core biological underpinnings. Regrettably, at present, we cannot formally compare our risk-taking measures because despite promising attempts to bring order to measurement chaos ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), we still lack a clear understanding of the data-generating processes involved. At a time when the reliability and replicability of neuroimaging research has come under scrutiny ( ;  ), tackling these open issues is crucial for the interpretation and generalizability of studies linking neural correlates with risk-taking-related developmental trajectories ( ;  ;  ;  ) and clinical outcomes ( ;  ). If the ultimate aim is to help individuals navigate an uncertain, risk-laden world and make better choices, we first need to navigate and map the mainly uncharted territory of our risk preference measures. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

We show that a deep neural network (DNN) can be employed for individual identification by learning important features from the time\u2010varying functional connectivity (FC) of rfMRI in the Human Connectome Project. We employed the trained DNN to identify individuals from an independent dataset acquired at our institution. The results revealed that the DNN could successfully identify 300 individuals with an error rate of 2.9% using 15\u2009s time\u2010window and 870 individuals with an error rate of 6.7%. A trained DNN with nonlinear hidden layers led to the proposal of the \u201cfingerprint of FC\u201d (fpFC) as representative edges of individual FC. The fpFCs for individuals exhibited commonly important and individual\u2010specific edges across time\u2010window lengths (from 5\u2009min to 15\u2009s). Furthermore, the utility of our model for another group of subjects was validated, supporting the feasibility of our technique in the context of transfer learning. In conclusion, our study offers an insight into the discovery of the intrinsic mode of the human brain using whole\u2010brain resting\u2010state FC and DNNs. \n  \nBy using deep neural networks (DNNs), reliable and robust fingerprints of resting\u2010state functional connectivity for individuals were found. The trained DNN showed its efficacy in the identification of individuals from an independent dataset via transfer learning.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n   Practitioner Points   \n  \nDeep neural network (DNN) identified individuals using resting\u2010state functional MRI (rfMRI). \n  \nThe fingerprint of functional connectivity (fpFC) for an individual was obtained from the trained DNN. \n  \nImportant edges in the fpFC were shared across individuals for varying time\u2010window lengths in rfMRI. \n  \nThe number of important edges in the fpFC showed a gradual change across the time\u2010window lengths. \n  \nThe trained DNN was applied to the identification of individuals from an independent dataset. \n  \n \n\n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nFunctional connectivity (FC) from the functional MRI (fMRI) modality has been widely used to investigate positively or negatively synchronized neural activations across the whole brain (Biswal et al.,\u00a0 ; Fox et al.,\u00a0 ; van den Heuvel & Hulshoff Pol,\u00a0 ). Many studies have consistently reported the existence of various functional networks (FNs) commonly found across subjects (Noble et al.,\u00a0 ). However, despite these similarities, there remains significant heterogeneity across individuals in terms of FC (Finn et al.,\u00a0 ; Gordon, Laumann, Adeyemo, & Petersen,\u00a0 ; Gordon, Laumann, Gilmore, et al.,\u00a0 ; Gratton et al.,\u00a0 ; Vanderwal et al.,\u00a0 ). Resting\u2010state fMRI (rfMRI) is dominated by spontaneous activity without the involvement of a particular stimulus or task. Because resting\u2010state FC is thought to characterize intrinsic functions (Biswal et al.,\u00a0 ), it has been frequently employed in various studies. For example, previous reports have identified individuals using their FC information obtained from rfMRI (Cai et al.,\u00a0 ; Chen & Hu,\u00a0 ; Demeter et al.,\u00a0 ; Finn et al.,\u00a0 ; Finn et al.,\u00a0 ; Horien et al.,\u00a0 ; Pallar\u00e9s et al.,\u00a0 ; Sarar et al.,\u00a0 ). In this context, there have been attempts to uncover the distinguishing interindividual differences of FCs. In previous works, the representative profile of an individual has often been termed \u201cfingerprint\u201d (Amico & Go\u00f1i,\u00a0 ; Cai et al.,\u00a0 ; Demeter et al.,\u00a0 ; Finn et al.,\u00a0 ; Liu et al.,\u00a0 ; Van De Ville et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nTime\u2010varying FC (tvFC), also known as dynamic FC, has been conventionally estimated using one of two approaches: (a) calculating the changes in FC across regions directly using the observed BOLD signals and (b) modeling underlying neural dynamics such as by using neural mass and neural field models (Lurie et al.,\u00a0 ). The ordinary sliding window approach refers to calculating a series of FC patterns using a fixed time window of seconds (s) or minutes (min) at shifting time points (Hindriks et al.,\u00a0 ; Hutchison et al.,\u00a0 ). There are alternative approaches to the sliding window approach with a fixed window length, such as adaptive windowing, Hidden Markov models, co\u2010activation pattern analysis, and clustering (Yaesoubi et al.,\u00a0 ). Numerous studies have employed static FC to extract a single FC pattern from time series data spanning the entire scan duration. However, other studies have explored the application of brief window lengths to extract a series of tvFC patterns, revealing distinct temporal dynamics unique to each individual (Fong et al.,\u00a0 ; Preti et al.,\u00a0 ; Savva et al.,\u00a0 ). In the present study, we examined whether the tvFC utilizing short window lengths could exhibit reliable individual\u2010specific information, comparable to the expectations of static FCs derived from extended window lengths, while concurrently accommodating the temporal variation inherent in tvFC patterns. A very short window is limited in producing reliable information due to the lower signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio arising from confounding factors such as physiological artifacts and scanner hardware noise disrupting the measurement of the synchrony of FNs within the brain (Murphy et al.,\u00a0 ; Power et al.,\u00a0 ). The use of tvFC with a short window can thus be challenging, but it remains potentially useful. Therefore, the development of computational models that can extract robust FC features from noisy tvFC patterns is required to enhance the utility of tvFC. Although previous studies have investigated the effects of various time window lengths on tvFC, consensus on the optimal window length for significant findings remains elusive (Gonzalez\u2010Castillo et al.,\u00a0 ; Preti et al.,\u00a0 ). This lack of definitive evidence prompted our investigation into the feasibility of individual identification across various window lengths, from less than a minute to several minutes. Prior attempts to distinguish individuals using FC features faced limitations, with error rates of less than 1% being achieved using static FC or a confined subject pool (Cai et al.,\u00a0 ; Demeter et al.,\u00a0 ). The pursuit of minimal error rates in the identification of a large cohort using tvFC patterns computed from brief time\u2010windows has presented substantial challenges (Chen & Hu,\u00a0 ; Sarar et al.,\u00a0 ; Van De Ville et al.,\u00a0 ). To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet been able to identify hundreds of participants with high accuracy using time\u2010windows under 1\u2009min, nor delineated common or unique edges across various window lengths. \n\nDeep neural network (DNN) models have been widely employed in classification tasks because of their superior performance and ability to organize hierarchical feature representations (Abrol et al.,\u00a0 ; Bengio et al.,\u00a0 ; Plis et al.,\u00a0 ). Despite their efficacy, however, overfitting has been a long\u2010standing issue for DNNs due to the large number of tunable weight parameters, which can easily compromise generalization performance (Baum & Haussler,\u00a0 ; MacKay,\u00a0 ; Neal,\u00a0 ; Schmidhuber,\u00a0 ). To prevent overfitting and to enhance the generalization performance of a DNN, a regularization penalty using weight parameters is frequently added to the cost function of the DNN, such as an L1\u2010norm term (e.g., LASSO), an L2\u2010norm term (e.g., ridge regression), or both (e.g., elastic net) (Zou & Hastie,\u00a0 ). An explicit weight sparsity control scheme for a DNN combines the advantages of both L1 (which helps to select essential features from input patterns) and L2 regularization (which helps to stabilize and collect important features) (Kim et al.,\u00a0 ). DNN models with explicit weight sparsity control have exhibited superior performance for both classification and regression problems due to their excellent hierarchical feature extraction capability, which is crucial for high\u2010dimensional and noisy whole\u2010brain fMRI data (Jang et al.,\u00a0 ; Kim et al.,\u00a0 ; Kim, Bandettini, & Lee,\u00a0 ; Kim & Lee,\u00a0 ). Recent efforts have been directed at extracting individual\u2010specific information from FC patterns using DNN (Cai et al.,\u00a0 ; Chen & Hu,\u00a0 ; Sarar et al.,\u00a0 ) and machine learning (ML) approaches (Vergara et al.,\u00a0 ). Both DNN and ML employ model\u2010based approaches capable of identifying crucial features for the model's objective through learning from the input. However, DNNs not only demonstrate superior feature extraction capabilities but also facilitate the derivation of hidden representations through the input\u2013output mapping process, which promotes transfer learning. This capability extends beyond the more limited scope of shallow ML models that are confined to learning decision boundary approaches (Abrol et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nIn the present study, we investigate the possibility of individual identification across different days using a weight\u2010sparsity\u2010controlled DNN as the computational model and tvFC as the input. From the trained DNN model, we report representative FC edges from the tvFC patterns of the human brain and refer to these as the fingerprint of FC (fpFC). The performance of the DNN is systematically evaluated using rfMRI data available from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and compared with that of alternative linear classifiers. We also investigate the feasibility of using the trained DNN to classify individuals using rfMRI data from our institute. We hypothesize that (1) DNN identification performance will be superior to that of shallow ML models, (2) individuals have a distinct tvFC fingerprint during a resting state even for shorter window lengths, and (3) important FC edges for individual identification are robust across various window lengths despite the presence of a moderate level of variability. This study presents that the DNN model can distinguish hundreds of individuals, even when FC is measured for a very short period of time (only a fraction of a minute). Moreover, the trained model is capable of providing a representative fingerprint\u2010like feature for each individual (i.e., fpFC). These fpFCs could serve as individual \u201cneuromarkers\u201d (Finn et al.,\u00a0 ), offering the potential to associate with and predict behavioral phenotypes and/or dysfunction toward the development of prognosis prediction and personalized treatment options (Kong et al.,\u00a0 ; Van De Ville et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Overview \n  \nFigure\u00a0  presents a schematic diagram of our DNN model for individual identification from rfMRI data of the HCP dataset (Van Essen et al.,\u00a0 ). The identity of an individual was predicted in the output layer based on the input tvFC patterns. The trained DNN was validated and tested using tvFC patterns acquired on another day. \n  \nIndividual identification using resting\u2010state tvFC and a DNN. (a) DNN classifier to identify individuals. The number of input dimensions for the DNN is 62,835 (i.e., FC edges from paired ROIs across all 355 ROIs). The number of output units corresponds to the number of individuals to be identified. The Softmax in the output layer was used to obtain the probability for each individual. The fpFCs were computed from the trained parameters of the DNN. (b) The tvFC patterns from one of the two visits were used for training, and the tvFC patterns from the other visit were used to validate and test the trained DNN model. (c) TvFC patterns were calculated from four rfMRI runs in the HCP dataset obtained from two visits. DNN, deep neural network; FC, functional connectivity; HCP, Human Connectome Project; rfMRI, resting\u2010state fMRI; ROIs, regions\u2010of\u2010interest; tvFC, time\u2010varying FC. \n  \n\n###  fMRI   data and preprocessing \n  \nWe used rfMRI data available from the HCP S1200 dataset (healthy young adults; age\u2009=\u200922\u201335) (Van Essen et al.,\u00a0 ). The rfMRI data were acquired on a customized Siemens 3\u2009T Connectome Skyra with a standard 32\u2010channel head coil at Washington University (Elam et al.,\u00a0 ). A total of 1200 volumes (approximately 14.4\u2009min) were obtained from each rfMRI run (TR/TE\u2009=\u2009720/33.1\u2009ms, voxel size\u2009=\u20092.0\u2009mm isotropic, slice thickness\u2009=\u20092.0\u2009mm without a gap, flip angle [FA]\u2009=\u200952\u00b0, field\u2010of\u2010view [FoV]\u2009=\u2009208\u2009\u00d7\u2009180\u2009mm ). Subjects were instructed to open their eyes and gaze at a crosshair while scanning. Each subject visited twice (on Days 1 and 2), and went through two runs of rfMRI where echo\u2010planar imaging (EPI) volumes were acquired in two different phase\u2010encoding directions (i.e., right\u2010to\u2010left [R\u2010L] and left\u2010to\u2010right [L\u2010R]). \n\nSeveral preprocessed versions of the raw rfMRI data are readily available within the HCP S1200 dataset (Glasser et al.,\u00a0 ; Glasser et al.,\u00a0 ; Griffanti et al.,\u00a0 ; Smith et al.,\u00a0 ). We used the preprocessed data from the HCP pipeline scripts v3.13.2. with MSMAll DeDrifting and Resampling based on MSMAll registration ( ). More specifically, the BOLD time series at cortical vertices has been registered to a template using MSMAll pipelines and optionally denoised using ICA\u2010FIX algorithms ( ), which is effective for ruling out connectivity due to spurious signals (Xifra\u2010Porxas et al.,\u00a0 ). In addition, the BOLD time series of rfMRI data underwent band\u2010pass filtering in the range of 0.01\u20130.1\u2009Hz. A total of 870 individuals out of approximately 1200 had four intact rfMRI runs with 1200 volumes per run and their rfMRI volume\u2010series files were available for several preprocessing strategies (i.e., MSMAll/MSMSulc registration and with/without ICA\u2010FIX denoising). The MSMSulc only used myelin maps (cortical folding patterns) to guide the registration process, whereas the MSMAll also incorporated rfMRI. The primary focus of our analysis was on datasets processed using MSMAll; however, we conducted comparative evaluations on datasets using MSMSulc as well. \n\n\n### Regions\u2010of\u2010interest and functional networks \n  \nThe 1200\u2010volume rfMRI data were registered to a template in the gray ordinate coordinate system, in which there are 59,412 vertices across the bilateral hemispheres. The multimodal parcellation (MMP) map was used to acquire the time series for 360 cortical regions\u2010of\u2010interest (ROIs) (Glasser et al.,\u00a0 ). We grouped our 360 ROIs based on seven cortical FNs (Thomas Yeo et al.,\u00a0 ), which include the visual network (VN), somatomotor network (SMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), limbic network (LN), frontoparietal network (FPN), and default\u2010mode network (DMN) (Figure\u00a0 ). Because the seven FNs had been defined using voxels, we projected them onto vertices then assigned FN membership for each ROI based on the most extensive overlap (i.e., a winner\u2010takes\u2010it\u2010all approach). Then, 5 out of 360 ROIs, residing in the medial wall near the cingulate cortex, did not overlap with any of the 7 FNs. Thus, 355 ROIs in total were assigned to the seven FNs. \n\nIn addition, we compared the identification performance using brain templates with fewer brain regions than present in the Glasser 360 atlas. To this end, we chose Schaefer's 100 and 200 ROIs defined using a gradient\u2010weighted Markov Random Field (gwMRF) model (Schaefer et al.,\u00a0 ). All ROIs were distributed among the seven FNs ( ) (Figure\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Estimation of tvFC patterns \n  \nWe averaged the BOLD time series in each of 355 ROIs across the vertices, yielding a 355\u2009\u00d7\u20091200 matrix for each rfMRI run. The tvFC patterns were obtained based on the sliding window approach. We calculated the Pearson's correlation coefficients between the time series for the 355 ROIs within each time window (Figure\u00a0 ). A vector of the upper diagonal edges of the 355\u2009\u00d7\u2009355 correlation matrix was 62,835 dimensional (cf. 4950 and 19,900 for Schaefer's 100 and 200 ROIs, respectively), which was Fisher's r\u2010to\u2010z transformed and pseudo   z  \u2010scored. The window slid forward from the first volume with no overlap with the previous window to prevent dependency between adjacent tvFC patterns. We obtained tvFC patterns for each of several window lengths ranging from seconds to minutes (i.e., 15\u2009s, 30\u2009s, 1\u2009min, 3\u2009min, and 5\u2009min). Considering the passband for the band\u2010pass filtering (0.01\u20130.1\u2009Hz, or equivalently, 10\u2010s to 100\u2010s\u2009cycles), we set the shortest window length as 15\u2009s. The number of tvFC patterns for each rfMRI run (14.4\u2009min) was 57, 28, 14, 4, and 2 for the 15\u2010s, 30\u2010s, 1\u2010min, 3\u2010min, and 5\u2010min windows, respectively. For each window length, corresponding tvFC patterns from all the four rfMRI runs per subject were used for training and the validation/testing of prediction models. \n\n\n### Individual identification \n  \nA fully connected DNN was employed to identify individuals (i.e., subjects) using the input tvFC patterns, where each of the output units from the DNN was assigned for each individual. Each hidden layer consisted of 2000\u2009units. Thus, the number of units per layer was 62,835 for the input layer, 2000 for each of the hidden layers 1 and 2, and   N   for the output layer, where   N   is the target number of individuals to identify. The DNN was trained to classify an individual's identity as a target label ( ). This multi\u2010class classification was implemented via the Softmax layer in the output ( ). The cost function for the DNN used to train the weight parameters was as follows: where  ,   is the output of the last layer corresponding to input  ,   is the L1\u2010norm parameter for the weights in the   l  th layer of the DNN ( ), and   is the L2\u2010norm parameter. \n\nThe weight sparsity levels between the DNN layers were explicitly controlled via the strength of  , and the optimal sparsity level was identified (see the supplementary materials, \u201c  Weight Sparsity Optimization  \u201d for more details including hyperparameter tuning). The   was fixed as 10 . The weight sparsity\u2010controlled DNN has shown better performance in classification/regression tasks than elastic net regularization (Kim, Bandettini, & Lee,\u00a0 ). This is because of the fine\u2010grained optimization of sparsity level using L1\u2010norm penalty via adaptive   during the training phase, compared to the optimization of the L1\u2010norm penalty term without an explicit weight sparsity control. The optimizer was stochastic gradient descent with an initial learning rate of 0.03 and a momentum of 0.9. The mini\u2010batch size varied from 13 to 1102 depending on the total number of individuals and the number of samples available for each individual (varying across window lengths). The activation function in each hidden layer was a hyperbolic tangent (tanh), and batch normalization was applied to the hidden layers. A rectified linear unit did not outperform tanh in our study. The DNN classifier was implemented using the deep learning library TensorFlow 1.15 ( ) in Python 3.6. The code and sample data are publicly available at our GitHub repository ( ). Several configurations for the target number of individuals for identification were tested (i.e., 100, 300, 600, and 870 out of the 870 individuals from HCP S1200 with 4 rfMRI runs). This target number corresponded to the number of output nodes (  N  ) of the DNN. \n\nThe training set consisted of the tvFC patterns calculated from the EPI volumes in the two rfMRI runs with R\u2010L and L\u2010R phase\u2010encoding on Day 1. The EPI volumes from Day 2 were used as the validation (rfMRI run with R\u2010L phase\u2010encoding) and test (rfMRI run with L\u2010R phase\u2010encoding) sets, respectively. Classification performance was evaluated for the training, validation, and test set, by calculating the error rate using all tvFC patterns/samples across all the subjects in each set. We additionally ran a slightly modified version of train\u2010and\u2010evaluate: training DNNs with all window lengths but not a 15\u2010s window and validation/test with a 15\u2010s window. It was to evaluate whether DNNs trained with varied window lengths were valid for noisy tvFCs from the shortest window as well. \n\nBecause physiological noise and head motion alter the BOLD time series and subsequently the FC patterns, the possibility that these confounding artifacts contributed to individual identification was investigated. Specifically, the identification performance using ICA\u2010FIX\u2010based time series denoising was evaluated. In addition, we monitored head motion on Day 1 using the root mean square (RMS) of frame\u2010wise displacement available in the \u201cMovement_RelativeRMS\u201d file in the HCP dataset. Then, the identification performance was compared at a subject level between individuals with high and low head motions. \n\nPattern matching (PM) between the training samples and the validation/test samples was conducted based on Pearson's correlation coefficients in MATLAB 2017b. Logistic regression (LR) and linear support vector machine (SVM) were tested as shallow linear ML models as a comparison with our DNN model. The LR (the \u201cLogisticRegression\u201d class) and SVM (the \u201cLinearSVC\u201d class) algorithms implemented in the Scikit\u2010learn library (version 0.22.1; Python 3.6) were used with an L2 penalty. For LR, we chose the \u201cnewton\u2010cg\u201d solver from among the five optional solvers available in Scikit\u2010learn because of its superior performance for large HCP datasets. The error rate for LR was investigated for both the multinomial scheme (to allow a comparison with the DNN) and one\u2010versus\u2010rest (OvR) schemes (to allow a comparison with SVM, whose algorithm only supports OvR). The L2 penalty term was optimized using a grid search (C \u2208 {10 , 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , 10 , 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , 10 , 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 } for LR; C \u2208 {10 , 10 , 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , 10 , 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , 10 , 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , 10 , 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , 1, 5, 10, 50, 10 , 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , 10 , 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , 10 } for SVM). We performed a nonparametric test, specifically the Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank test, to compare the error rates of DNN with the error rate of LR, due to the small sample size and non\u2010normal distribution. A one\u2010tailed test was selected, positing the null hypothesis that DNN's performance would not surpass that of LR, against the alternative hypothesis that DNN would outperform LR. To determine whether error rates varied with the number of layers, we performed the Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum test, a nonparametric analogue to the two\u2010sample   t   test. Furthermore, we conducted a one\u2010sample   t   test to assess the difference in error rates across all subjects compared with the chance level and a paired\u2010sample   t   test to compare subject\u2010wise error rates between two DNN models. \n\n\n### Fingerprint of FC \n  \nWe extracted an FC signature for individual identification that is hidden within the tvFC patterns from a trained DNN model. To this end, the weight feature vectors   (62,835\u2009\u00d7\u2009  N  ) were estimated by multiplying the weight parameter matrices   across all layers from the input layer to the output layers (Equation\u00a0 ) (Erhan et al.,\u00a0 ; Jang et al.,\u00a0 ; Kim et al.,\u00a0 ; Kim, Bandettini, & Lee,\u00a0 ): \n\nThe   z  \u2010scored vector   (62,835\u2009\u00d7\u20091) yielded an fpFC for an individual, where   n   indicates an index of output unit corresponding to the individual. Based on both qualitative and quantitative criteria, we labeled the edges within the fpFCs with four designated categories: (a) reliable edge, (b) distinct edge, (c) important edge, and (d) robust edge (Table\u00a0 ). For the quantitative definition of an edge based on fpFCs, we calculated the standard deviation (STD) across the target individuals and an intra\u2010class correlation coefficient (ICC; two\u2010way random effects with absolute agreement) (McGraw & Wong,\u00a0 ) across the target individuals and training repetitions using MATLAB. Only the edges whose ICCs were greater than 0.6 (Cicchetti,\u00a0 ; Landis & Koch,\u00a0 ) were considered to be (a) reliable and preserved in the subsequent analysis to determine the distinct edges. The heterogeneity of the fpFCs across the individuals was also evaluated. The STD was calculated for each edge of an average fpFC from the five repetitions across individuals. The upper 98th percentile of the STD was reported as a (b) distinct edge. The edges that met the thresholds for both reliability (i.e., ICC\u2009>0.6) and distinctiveness (i.e., STD\u2009>\u200998th percentile) were defined as (c) important edges. Important edges that were common across the five window lengths were obtained and classified as (d) robust edges which are invariant to window length. The number of important edges for each FN pair was compared between window lengths. Unless otherwise stated, this ICC and STD analysis was conducted using the fpFCs obtained from two\u2010hidden\u2010layer DNN models trained to identify 300 individuals from the HCP. To evaluate the stability of error rates and the significance of FC edges, we repeated the training of DNN models an additional 20 times, culminating in a total of 25 iterations. FC edges were visualized using circular plots and a 3D brain ( ). Generating an activation maximization map   can be an alternative method to interpret the trained DNN model, rather than weight features. To this end, input FC edges that maximized each of the output units were estimated using a gradient ascent approach via back\u2010propagation (Equation\u00a0 ) (Erhan et al.,\u00a0 ): fpFCs were similarly obtained by z\u2010scoring a vector at an output unit. \n  \nGlossary for connectivity edges defined from fpFCs. \n    \n\n### Reproducibility of the   fpFC   for various training configurations \n  \nAn individual fpFC should be consistent between visits (i.e., sessions; Days 1 and 2) and not be biased toward a particular group of individuals. We thus evaluated the specificity of the obtained fpFC for six configurations, with distinct groups of individuals used for identification and the training and validation/test data shuffled. Specifically, we created three groups of individuals within the training dataset for the DNN model, each encompassing one common target individual (Figure\u00a0 ): (I) an initial group with 300 individuals including the target individual, (II) a second group with 300 individuals including 299 new individuals and the target individual, and (III) a third group that adds another 300 new individuals to the second group (i.e., a total of 600 individuals). We obtained six independent training outcomes by employing the three distinct groups while alternating the training and validation/test sets (i.e., Day 1 data for training and Day 2 data for validation/testing; Day 2 data for training and Day 1 data for validation/testing). Similarity scores across the fpFCs were measured using Pearson's correlation coefficients for the configurations. For each pair of configurations, the similarity of the target individual's fpFCs was compared with the similarities of all other individuals' fpFCs. \n\n\n### Genetic influence on the   fpFC  \n  \nDue to previous reports indicating that genetic relatedness is reflected in the fpFC (Finn et al.,\u00a0 ; Liu et al.,\u00a0 ; Mueller et al.,\u00a0 ), we were motivated to examine whether our reported fpFC originated in part from genotypical characteristics. We divided individuals from the HCP into four groups according to their genetic relatedness: (a) monozygotic twins (MZ), (b) dizygotic twins (DZ), (c) siblings, and (d) others. The similarity of the fpFC was calculated for paired individuals within each group and compared between groups. More specifically, first, we obtained the average fpFC for each individual across the five window lengths using mean fpFC from the five trained DNNs to classify 300 individuals with random initial weights for each window length. We stratified the 300 individuals into pairs of individuals based on their genetic relatedness: MZ, who shared identical genes, DZ, siblings, and others. The averaged fpFCs were compared across these stratified groups of individuals. The correlation coefficients for the average fpFCs were Fisher's r\u2010to\u2010z transformed. The   z  \u2010scored similarity of the representative fpFCs was compared across the groups using one\u2010way ANOVA followed by a post hoc two\u2010sample   t   test. The resulting   p   values were Bonferroni\u2010corrected. \n\n\n### Generalization of the trained   DNN   to an independent dataset via transfer learning \n  \nIn this study, we evaluated the application of a DNN, which had been trained on HCP data in the processing of independent datasets through the extrapolation of learned characteristics. For this purpose, we conducted a similar rfMRI experiment at our institute following the HCP protocol using a 3\u2010T MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Tim Trio; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and a 12\u2010channel head coil (to display cross\u2010fixation for subjects with their eyes open during rfMRI runs via MR\u2010compatible visual binocular goggles). A multiband (MB) gradient\u2010echo EPI pulse sequence developed by the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (Department of Radiology, University of Minnesota) was used to acquire the rfMRI data at our institute. The specific imaging parameters were as follows: MB factor\u2009=\u20092; Generalized Auto\u2010Calibrating Partial Parallel Acquisitions (GRAPPA) on; TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms; FA\u2009=\u200971\u00b0; FoV\u2009=\u2009192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192\u2009mm ; 50 axial slices without a gap; TR\u2009=\u20091.44\u2009s (twice that of the HCP [0.72\u2009s] due to the lower parallel imaging factor to cover the whole brain); and voxel size\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm  (Kim, Tegethoff, et al.,\u00a0 ; Tozzi et al.,\u00a0 ). In addition, we collected a gradient\u2010echo field map to correct EPI distortion as required from the HCP pipelines ( ). \n\nThe overall study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Korea University. The participants submitted written consent forms and were compensated as outlined in the IRB documents. Fifteen healthy young adults participated in the experiment (age\u2009=\u200923\u201334, seven females). Fourteen of these subjects (all except one female) made two visits on consecutive days. They were instructed to gaze at a white cross\u2010fixation on a black screen during the rfMRI run. Their eyes were monitored via eye trackers attached to the goggles throughout the rfMRI run (NordicNeuroLab;  ). Two rfMRI runs with R\u2010L and L\u2010R phase\u2010encoding and a T1\u2010weighted image were acquired on the first day, while two rfMRI runs with R\u2010L/L\u2010R phase\u2010encoding and T2\u2010weighted images were acquired on the second day. The rfMRI runs were preprocessed using the HCP pipelines (Glasser et al.,\u00a0 ; Glasser et al.,\u00a0 ; Griffanti et al.,\u00a0 ). Subsequently, the tvFC patterns were obtained from the preprocessed rfMRI BOLD time series described in Section\u00a0 . The number of time points used for FC calculation with the same window length was half that of the HCP because the TR for our dataset was twice as long. \n\nA pretrained DNN for the 870 individuals from the HCP using tvFC patterns from a 15\u2010s window was restored for transfer learning. The TensorFlow variables of the pretrained DNN, such as the weights, biases, and batch\u2010normalization\u2010related parameters from the first to the last hidden layers, were restored. A new output classification layer was created with 314 units to accommodate the 14 new individuals from our institute and the 300 individuals from the HCP, and randomly initialized. During the transfer learning phase, the DNN model was trained under either of two conditions: (1) freezing parameters from the first to the last hidden layers and fine\u2010tuning only the classification layer, and (2) fine\u2010tuning all layers. A DNN model trained using randomly initialized weights across all layers was evaluated as a baseline model. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Individuals are more clearly distinguished using a   DNN   than using shallow linear models \n  \nFigure\u00a0  shows the error rates across various scenarios. For 300 individual identification cases, the longer the time window for the tvFC patterns, the lower the error rate, particularly for PM (Figures\u00a0  and  ). Model\u2010based approaches, including linear SVM, LR, and the DNN exhibited a remarkably lower error rate compared to PM. Notably, there was a substantial reduction in the error rates of LR and DNN for a 30\u2010s window (e.g., 83.2% for PM, 0.4% for LR, and 0.2% for the DNN) compared with a 15\u2010s window (e.g., 91.4% for PM, 5.1% for LR, and 2.9% for the DNN). For all window lengths, two\u2010hidden\u2010layer DNNs had lower error rates than LR (DNN: 2.9, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, and 0.2% for 15\u2009s, 30\u2009s, 1\u2009min, 3\u2009min, and 5\u2009min\u2010windows, respectively; LR: 5.1, 0.4, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.3%; one\u2010tailed Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank test,   N  \u2009=\u20095,   W  \u2009=\u20090,   p  \u2009=\u2009.0312). The performance of the DNNs remained consistently superior through an additional 20 repetitions of the training process for the DNNs (DNN: 3.0, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, and 0.1%;   N  \u2009=\u200925,   W  \u2009=\u20090,   p  \u2009=\u20093.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ). We could not obtain identification results for the 15\u2010s window from SVM because there was an overflow error due to the large sample size. An alternative approach is to use libsvm\u2010based SVC instead of LinearSVC; however, it produced an inferior performance and was computationally expensive. For example, the test error rate for a 15\u2010s window and 300 individuals was 39.3% using the trained libsvm\u2010based SVC model and took about a month to compute using our system (two Intel Xeon Gold 5120 CPUs). The error rate generally increased as the number of individuals increased (Figure\u00a0 ). The DNN was consistently the best performing model, with an error rate of 6.7% for a 15\u2010s window with 870 individuals (cf. 9.9% for LR). \n  \nTest error rates for the individual identification of Human Connectome Project (HCP) subjects for various scenarios. (a) Error rate for 300 individual identification scenarios for various window lengths. The error rate for LR was consistently higher using the OvR scheme compared to the multinomial scheme. We conducted five repetitions of training and testing for the DNN with random initialization at each window length. (b) Error rate for various numbers of individuals to be identified using 15\u2010s window\u2010based tvFC, time\u2010varying functional connectivity (tvFC). Multinomial target output was used for LR. A DNN identifying 300 individuals was repeated five times, and a DNN identifying 100 or 600 individuals was run with three repetitions. DNN, deep neural network; LR, logistic regression; OvR, one\u2010versus\u2010rest; PM, pattern matching; SVM, support vector machine. \n  \nThe DNN models trained using tvFC patterns from longer window lengths than 15\u2009s were tested using tvFC patterns from a 15\u2009s window. The error rates of 300 individual identification models from 30\u2009s, 1\u2009min, 3\u2009min, and 5\u2009min windows were 3.7, 6.5, 16.5, and 52.0%, respectively. These rates are notably low given that the chance level is 1\u20131/300\u2009=\u200999.7% (one\u2010sample   t   test,   df  \u2009=\u2009299,   p  \u2009=\u2009.0). The DNN trained on the aggregate of the four longer windows (i.e., 30\u2009s, 1\u2009min, 3\u2009min, and 5\u2009min) exhibited a test error rate of 4.0% on the 15\u2009s window, which was higher than 3.7% from the DNN trained solely on the 30\u2009s window (paired\u2010sample   t   test,   df  \u2009=\u2009299,   T  \u2009=\u20092.2,   p  \u2009=\u2009.028). This error rate was also higher than the 2.9% from the DNN trained using the FC patterns from the 15\u2009s window (paired\u2010sample   t   test,   df  \u2009=\u2009299,   T  \u2009=\u20096.3,   p  \u2009=\u20098.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ). \n\nRegistration by MSMSulc instead of MSMAll or time series denoising using ICA\u2010FIX improved the classification performance (Figure\u00a0 ). The error rate for the 21 individuals with high head motion (RMS [mm]\u2009>\u2009.14; Finn et al.,\u00a0 ) was 5.8%\u2009\u00b1\u20096.6, which was greater than the error rate of 2.7%\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0 for the remaining 279 individuals (two\u2010sample   t   test,   df  \u2009=\u2009298,   T  \u2009=\u2009\u22123.2,   p  \u2009=\u2009.0016). An adaptation of an atlas with fewer ROIs led to a higher error rate (Figure\u00a0 ). Error rates of DNN and LR using Schaefer's 100 and 200 ROIs were still substantially lower than the PM. However, DNN did not outperform LR for the 5\u2010min window using 200 ROIs, or 3\u2010 and 5\u2010min windows using 100 ROIs. \n\n\n### The weight\u2010sparsity\u2010optimized   DNN   is superior to alternative models \n  \nFor tvFCs with a 15\u2010s window, the DNN model trained with optimal weight sparsity levels performed better when there were two hidden layers (validation/test error rate\u2009=\u20094.1/2.9%) compared to one hidden layer (5.3/3.7%; Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum test,   N  \u2009=\u20095/5,   U  \u2009=\u200925/25,   p  \u2009=\u2009.0079/.0079). While the test set benefitted significantly from the two hidden layers, the improvement in the validation set was marginal when compared to the three\u2010layer setup (4.2/3.1%; Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum test,   N  \u2009=\u20095/5,   U  \u2009=\u200921/25,   p  \u2009=\u2009.0952/.0079) hidden layers (Figure\u00a0 ). The test error rate for the two\u2010hidden\u2010layer DNN (2.9%) was lower than that of the LR (5.1%; one\u2010tailed Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank test,   N  \u2009=\u20095,   W  \u2009=\u20090,   p  \u2009=\u2009.0312), representing an improvement of 43.1%. The optimal weight sparsity for each hidden layer differed according to the depth of the DNN. The results for optimal weight sparsity with varying numbers of hidden layers are described in the \u201c  Optimal Levels of Weight Sparsity with Varying Numbers of Hidden Layers  \u201d section of the Supplementary Materials. \n\n\n###  FpFC   characterizes individual connectivity profiles and suggests robust edges \n  \nOverall, the edges with high ICCs exhibited strong variability across individuals (Figures\u00a0  and  ). We primarily found window\u2010length invariant robust edges in the DMN and FPN, many of which are located in the frontal lobe (Figure\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0 ). Notably, the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; i.e., area 9 anterior) was included in the top three most critical regions in the FPN. In addition, intra\u2010FN and intra\u2010hemispheric connections were dominant over inter\u2010FN and inter\u2010hemispheric connections. Robust edges accounted for almost half of the important edges for each window length; in particular, 47.3, 47.3, 47.3, 52.1, and 48.0% of the important edges identified for the 15\u2010s, 30\u2010s, 1\u2010min, 3\u2010min, and 5\u2010min windows, respectively, were classified as robust. Across different numbers of ROIs, we generally found noticeable engagement of intra\u2010hemispheric connections in the frontal lobe for individual identification (Figures\u00a0 ,  , and  ). There was a larger involvement of the occipital lobe using 100 and 200 ROIs from Schaefer's atlas than 355 ROIs from Glasser's atlas. The edges in intra\u2010DMN and DMN\u2010FPN were consistently significant (Figures\u00a0 ,  , and  ). However, the edges in intra\u2010VN, VN\u2010FPN, SMN\u2010DAN, or VAN\u2010DMN were more pronounced for 100 ROIs and 200 ROIs compared to 355 ROIs. On the other hand, the significance of edges in intra\u2010DAN, intra\u2010FPN, VN\u2010DAN, DAN\u2010VAN, DAN\u2010FPN, LN\u2010FPN, LN\u2010DMN, or FPN\u2010DMN was reduced. The fpFC from activation maximization maps resulted in patterns that were markedly similar to our weight feature representation based on the multiplication of weight matrices (Figure\u00a0 ). The weight feature vectors suggested 595 robust edges across window lengths, while activation maximization suggested 591 robust edges. A total of 582 robust edges were identical between these estimates. Nonetheless, some edges existed that were found by weight feature vectors but not by activation maximization, or vice versa (Figure\u00a0 ). Most of the edges significant only for weight feature vectors were connected to the ROIs in the frontal cortex, predominantly in FPN and DMN. In contrast, activation maximization not only revealed the important edges of the frontal lobe but also indicated associations with other brain areas. For example, there were edges in FPN\u2010VAN, including a connection between the frontal and the temporal lobe. \n  \nInformative edges in the fpFC for individual identification. (a) ICC and STD for each edge in the fpFCs across five window lengths. (b) Robust edges (c) The number of important edges from intra\u2010 and inter\u2010FNs. In each plot, the brighter bars at the bottom indicate the number of robust edges. The darker bars above represent important but not robust edges for each window length. The plots on the right present the number and percentage of important edges for the corresponding FN pair between window lengths. Please see Table\u00a0  for the details on the definition of robust and important edges. The fpFC patterns were obtained from DNN models for the identification of 300 individuals. DAN, dorsal attention network; DMN, default\u2010mode network; FN, functional network; fpFC, fingerprint of functional connectivity; FPN, frontoparietal network; ICC, intra\u2010class correlation coefficient; LN, limbic network; SMN, somatomotor network; STD, standard deviation; VAN, ventral attention network; VN, visual network. \n    \nList of the 30 most frequently involved ROIs in the robust edges of the fpFCs used for the identification of 300 individuals. The ROIs are listed based on how many robust edges were connected to the ROIs. The ROI labels were obtained from a 360\u2009MMP parcellation map (Glasser et al.,\u00a0 ), and the corresponding region from the AAL atlas with the highest overlap for each ROI is indicated (for more details, refer to the \u201c  ROIs on the AAL Atlas  \u201d section of the Supplementary Materials). \n    \n\n### Important edges for individual identification vary depending on the window length \n  \nFor all window lengths, the intra\u2010 and inter\u2010FN edges of the FPN and DMN had the highest number of important edges (Figure\u00a0 ). When normalized by the number of total edges, the intra\u2010FPN and intra\u2010DAN also exhibited a high proportion of important edges. Although we reported that approximately 50% of the important edges were commonly found across window lengths, there were some noticeable changes in the important edges depending on window length. For example, there were a greater number of important but not robust intra\u2010FN edges in the VN and DAN as the window length decreased (Figure\u00a0 ). On the other hand, a higher number of inter\u2010FN edges, such as those for FPN\u2010DMN, were important as the window length increased. The intra\u2010DMN and intra\u2010FPN also exhibited a slight change in the number of important edges between window lengths. From 25 repetitions instead of 5 repetitions of DNN training, 96.9, 96.4, 95.2, 32.8, and 11.5% of the total edges were replicated as important edges for the 15\u2010s, 30\u2010s, 1\u2010min, 3\u2010min, and 5\u2010min windows. When we lowered the threshold for ICC from 0.6 to 0.5, 96.9, 96.4, 95.2, 85.4, and 89.4% were replicated. Figure\u00a0  shows the average fpFC across five window lengths for each of five arbitrarily chosen individuals (Figure\u00a0 ) and the fpFC for each window length (Figure\u00a0 ). The combination of positive and negative values for the edges appeared to characterize distinct fpFCs between individuals. \n  \nFpFCs from five arbitrarily chosen individuals.

Specifically, others' fpFCs exhibited very low correlations (almost zero), while the target's own fpFC displayed much higher correlation. A qualitative examination of the robust edges' similarity to their corresponding fpFC revealed a tendency for the fpFC patterns to exhibit greater resemblance to their own rather than to those of others, irrespective of the configuration (Figure\u00a0 ). Moreover, the important edges for 15\u2010s window tvFC obtained from the DNN model used to identify 300 individuals heavily overlapped with those from the DNN models used to identify 100, 600, and 870 individuals, with an overlap of 70, 81, and 82%, respectively. \n\n\n### Genetic information is present in the   fpFC  \n  \nThe mean of the   z  \u2010transformed Pearson's correlation coefficients of the fpFC for paired individuals was 0.13, 0.08, 0.06, and 0.00, for the MZ, DZ, sibling, and others groups, respectively (Figure\u00a0 ). One\u2010way ANOVA revealed a significant group difference (  df  \u2009=\u200944,849,   F  \u2009=\u200982.5,   p  \u2009<\u200910 ). The similarities of the fpFC within the others group were significantly lower than for any of the family groups (  df  \u2009=\u200944,811,   T  \u2009=\u200912.2 for MZ;   df  \u2009=\u200944,804,   T  \u2009=\u20095.1 for DZ;   df  \u2009=\u200944,827,   T  \u2009=\u20098.6 for sibling; Bonferroni corrected   p  \u2009<\u200910  from a post hoc two\u2010sample   t   test). The similarities within the MZ group were more significant than within the sibling group (  df  \u2009=\u200942,   T  \u2009=\u20095.3, Bonferroni corrected   p  \u2009<\u200910 ) but the significance was reduced when compared to the DZ group (  df  \u2009=\u200919,   T  \u2009=\u20093.4, Bonferroni\u2010corrected   p  \u2009<\u2009.05) due to a potential outlier in the DZ group. These findings suggest that genetic information is reflected by the phenotypical fpFC. \n  \nSimilarity of the fpFC between paired individuals within each of four groups selected based on their genetic relatedness.

The error rate obtained for the HCP data and our institute was 14.5 and 45.2%, respectively. For a 30\u2010s window, the average error rate declined to 4.5% (3.4% for HCP and 27.3% for our institute). This error rate remains higher in comparison to the scenario where the model was trained with random initial weights, which showed an error rate of 4.1% (3.1 and 25.5%) for a 15\u2010s window and 0.6% (0.2 and 8.7%) for a 30\u2010s window. However, these rates were significantly above the level of chance (1\u20131/314\u2009=\u200999.7%; one\u2010sample   t   test,   p  \u2009<\u200910 ) for both a 15\u2010s window (  df  \u2009=\u2009299,   T  \u2009=\u2009\u2212106.5 and   df  \u2009=\u200913,   T  \u2009=\u2009\u221213.7), and a 30\u2010s window (  df  \u2009=\u2009299,   T  \u2009=\u2009\u2212209.6 and   df  \u2009=\u200913,   T  \u2009=\u2009\u221214.9). This demonstrates that, despite not being flawless, the features learned for the individual identification of HCP subjects could hold informative value when applied to an independent dataset. \n\nWhen parameters of all layers were fine\u2010tuned, the average error rate was substantially reduced to 4.2% (3.3% for HCP data and 24.3% for our institute) for a 15\u2010s window, and 0.4% (0.1 and 4.9%) for a 30\u2010s window. In addition, false positives between the subjects in the HCP and at our institute (i.e., falsely identified as an HCP subject for the subject at our institute) were substantially decreased for the transfer learning model when all DNN parameters were fine\u2010tuned. Interestingly, training completion could potentially have been expedited during the fine\u2010tuning process. For a 15\u2010s window, the average error rate at the 200th epoch was the lowest as 3.8%. Error rates for subjects from our institute were marginally lower (  df  \u2009=\u200913,   T  \u2009=\u2009\u22121.9,   p  \u2009=\u2009.09) in comparison to those for HCP participants, which did not show a statistically significant decrease (  df  \u2009=\u2009299,   T  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.9,   p  \u2009=\u2009.4) relative to the random initialization case (Figure\u00a0 ). For a 30\u2010s window, the lowest error rate during fine\u2010tuning was noted at the 600th epoch, whereas for the randomly initialized case, this low was observed at the 500th epoch. The error rates for fine\u2010tuning involving both HCP subjects and those from our institute were substantially lower (  df  \u2009=\u2009299,   T  \u2009=\u2009\u22122.5,   p  \u2009=\u2009.01 and   df  \u2009=\u200913,   T  \u2009=\u2009\u22122.9,   p  \u2009=\u2009.01) compared with those of random initialization. \n  \n(a) Error rates and (b) confusion matrix at the 200th epoch from individual identification using transfer learning with fine\u2010tuning of all parameters in the deep neural network (DNN) trained for the identification of 870 individuals using 15\u2010s windows.

The dotted black horizontal line indicates the average error rate. The color bar for the confusion matrix was set at 6% to better visualize misclassified samples. \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \n### Summary of the study \n  \nWe reported that tvFC from time windows as short as 15\u2009s could be used to identify individuals with a DNN. The error rate from the identification of 300 individuals using a two\u2010hidden\u2010layer DNN (2.9 and 0.2% for 15 and 30\u2009s, respectively) was substantially lower than that for alternative approaches (91.4 and 83.2% using PM; 5.1 and 0.4% using LR). The two\u2010hidden\u2010layer DNN also had the lowest error rate when compared to alternative models for 870 target subjects (95.1, 9.9, and 6.7% for the PM, LR, and DNN, respectively; 15\u2010s window). Individual fpFC, which characterizes the tvFC of individuals, contained important edges that were reliable and heterogeneous across the individuals. Approximately 50% of the important edges were robust, i.e., commonly found across the five window lengths (15\u2009s, 30\u2009s, 1\u2009min, 3\u2009min, and 5\u2009min). The two most representative FNs associated with these robust edges were the FPN and DMN, many of which are located in the frontal lobe. We also raised the possibility that genotypical characteristics are reflected in the phenotypical traits of tvFC using stratified groups based on their genetic relatedness, which has been similarly reported in a recent study (Demeter et al.,\u00a0 ). Finally, we demonstrated the feasibility of generalizing a DNN model trained using HCP data to an independent dataset acquired from our institute. \n\n\n### The advantage of   DNN   in individual identification \n  \nOverall, the reported findings suggest that a multilayered DNN model is more suitable for individual identification using tvFC patterns than alternative shallow approaches. In particular, PM demonstrated weaker performance overall than model\u2010based classifiers, probably because PM treats all edges equally and thus is susceptible to noise. On the other hand, model\u2010based approaches can weigh important edges by learning the corresponding weighting factors as model parameters. This feature\u2010learning capability has been suggested as a key advantage of deep learning approaches over standard ML approaches (Abrol et al.,\u00a0 ). Thus, the superior performance of our DNN model is likely to be due to the inherent feature\u2010learning ability through nonlinear hidden layers. In contrast, shallow models such as LR learn only decision boundaries using the given input features. \n\nUsing PM, a considerable gap in error rates existed between the 1\u2010 and 3\u2010min windows. This may be explained with reference to a previous study demonstrating that the fidelity of FC fingerprints measured by ICC does not reach saturation until the window length reaches a size of 144\u2009s to 288\u2009s (Figure\u00a0 ) (Van De Ville et al.,\u00a0 ). Although the DNN and LR models both performed almost perfectly for the 30\u2010s and longer windows (error rate <0.5%), the DNN for the 15\u2010s window exhibited a substantially lower error rate than did the LR. This suggests that individual\u2010specific information of FC reflected in BOLD signals between 0.033\u2009Hz (=1/30\u2009s) and 0.1\u2009Hz (due to band\u2010pass filtering) is usefully exploited by both the DNN and LR. However, for BOLD signals between 0.067\u2009Hz (=1/15\u2009s) and 0.1\u2009Hz, the DNN was better able to harness the information. Therefore, it appears that there may be relatively straightforward and crucial individual\u2010specific information contained within BOLD signals between 0.033 and 0.067\u2009Hz. In contrast, individual\u2010specific information in BOLD signals between 0.067 and 0.1\u2009Hz may be more subtle and noisier, which may be handled better by the DNN. \n\n\n### Weight\u2010sparsity\u2010optimized   DNNs   for effective information extraction \n  \nThe identification performance was possibly higher because of the enhanced feature selection in each layer in our DNN model due to weight sparsity optimization within a grid search framework (Jang et al.,\u00a0 ; Kim et al.,\u00a0 ). Our findings highlight the importance of fine\u2010grained FC feature selection for individual identification from noisy tvFC patterns, particularly for short time windows (Figure\u00a0 ). A detailed discussion of weight sparsity can be found in \u201c  Optimization of Weight Sparsity for Enhanced Performance of DNN  \u201d in Supplementary Materials. \n\n\n### Shared features of   tvFCs   across window lengths detected by   DNNs  \n  \nUpon evaluating the tvFC patterns with a 15\u2010s window, DNN models trained on longer windows demonstrated error rates much lower than the chance level. Moreover, almost half of the important edges in the fpFC were commonly found across all window lengths. These observations imply that DNN models trained for different window lengths share FC features to a substantial degree, despite potential variability due to window length difference (Figure\u00a0 ). Upon performing multiple iterations of DNN, retention rates of important edges for 3\u2010 and 5\u2010min windows were only 32.8 and 11.5%, respectively, whereas retention exceeded 95% for the shorter windows. Interestingly, the retention rates for the 3\u2010 and 5\u2010min windows increased to 85.4 and 89.4% when the ICC threshold was lowered from 0.6 to 0.5. This indicates that the reliability of DNNs for longer windows might be compromised by the limited size of the training samples. Conversely, the specificity of the window length became evident through the analysis of error rates in tests using the shortest 15\u2009s\u2010window. Specifically, the DNN trained across the 30\u2009s, 1\u2009min, 3\u2009min, and 5\u2009min windows exhibited a higher error rate compared with training solely with the 15\u2009s window. This suggests that the individual\u2010specific FC feature in the shorter window may not be recovered from the increased number of training samples with longer window lengths (4\u2009+\u20098\u2009+\u200928\u2009+\u200956\u2009=\u200996). \n\n\n### Edges characterizing individuals in the   fpFC  \n  \nWe demonstrated that individual\u2010specific characteristics of the FC are primarily embedded in the FPN and DMN, largely in the frontal lobe (Figure\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0 ). In particular, DLPFC in the FPN is known as one of the most important regions for cognitive control, and is believed to play a critical role in shaping individual traits in brain function (Goldberg,\u00a0 ; Miller & Cohen,\u00a0 ). Furthermore, DLPFC has also been found to be highly variable in its activation level, volume size, location, structural connectivity, and FC (Friedman & Miyake,\u00a0 ; Panikratova et al.,\u00a0 ). For example, the FC of DLPFC has been shown to be related to individual variability in cognition (Panikratova et al.,\u00a0 ; Turnbull et al.,\u00a0 ). In line with these studies, we also found that the intra\u2010 and inter\u2010FN edges from the FPN and DMN were critical for robust identification of individuals across all window lengths (Figure\u00a0 ). Many previous studies have investigated representative FCs associated with individual traits. Finn et al. reported that regions in the FPN are important in forming personal fingerprints (Finn et al.,\u00a0 ). In addition, Pallar\u00e9s et al. found that the frontal and cingulate systems were important for individual identification (Pallar\u00e9s et al.,\u00a0 ). The DMN is known to be closely involved in internal mentation (Andrews\u2010Hanna,\u00a0 ). In particular, regions within the DMN have been associated with the retrieval of past experiences and the contemplation of future events during periods of rest, as well as in the processes of self\u2010reflection and understanding others. Based on this report, personal experiences and thoughts may have contributed to the FC features of the DMN in characterizing individuals in our findings. Furthermore, the DMN has been suggested as a network depicting individual differences regarding mind\u2010wandering or daydreaming (Gorgolewski et al.,\u00a0 ; Kucyi & Davis,\u00a0 ). The highly robust individual\u2010specific edges in the fpFC in the higher\u2010order cortical areas could also be attributed to epigenetic factors during prolonged developmental maturation (Mueller et al.,\u00a0 ; Petanjek et al.,\u00a0 ). The regions are also known to be under substantial genetic influence, which is consistent with our results (Figure\u00a0 ) (Colclough et al.,\u00a0 ). Despite the dominant edges from the FPN and DMN in the fpFC, there was also considerable involvement of other FNs. Intra\u2010FN edges from the VN, SMN, DAN, and LN were relatively important for shorter window lengths (Figure\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). Interestingly, the low inter\u2010individual variability for these FNs in resting\u2010state FC has previously been reported (Mueller et al.,\u00a0 ). Inter\u2010FN edges such as VN\u2010DAN, LN\u2010FPN, and LN\u2010DMN appeared to be influenced by window lengths. Previous works using HCP data suggested the importance of higher\u2010order cognitive systems and sensorimotor systems in FC fingerprinting (Liu et al.,\u00a0 ; Van De Ville et al.,\u00a0 ). Notably, Van De Ville et al. found that VN and SMN are informative for shorter windows, whereas DMN and FPN are most informative for longer windows. Our findings are also in line with another work reporting FPN and DMN as containing the most reliable FC edges with respect to test\u2013retest reliability (Noble et al.,\u00a0 ). Similarly, we also demonstrated the importance of intra\u2010VN and intra\u2010DAN for the shorter window and FPN\u2010DMN for the longer window. \n\nOur findings using Glasser's 355 ROIs were replicated using Schaefer's 100 and 200 ROIs with many robust edges in intra\u2010DMN and DMN\u2010FPN (Figures\u00a0  and  ). However, some differences were present, such as the relatively increased significance of intra\u2010VN, SMN\u2010DAN, or VAN\u2010DMN, and decreased significance of intra\u2010DAN, intra\u2010FPN, or DAN\u2010VAN for Schaefer's atlas compared to Glasser's atlas (Tozzi et al.,\u00a0 ). One reason might be a lower spatial resolution in FC edges due to a reduced number of ROIs. A coarse scale of ROIs might have blurred a strong interaction of specific regions by blending them with other regions into a single big ROI (Termenon et al.,\u00a0 ). The parcellation algorithms could lead to different boundaries of ROIs depicting different neural properties (Glasser et al.,\u00a0 ; Schaefer et al.,\u00a0 ). For example, the division of Glasser's ROIs is fine\u2010grained, while Schaefer's ROIs have a coarse division at the DLPFC of FPN (Figures\u00a0 ,  , and  ). Despite overall finer ROI divisions for Glasser's ROIs, the early visual cortex at the occipital lobe is very coarsely divided in that scheme, whereas Schaefer's ROIs feature more fine\u2010grained divisions (Figures\u00a0 ,  , and  ). Furthermore, a mismatch of network boundaries between the parcellation atlases could affect the interpretation of ROIs at the network level (Figures\u00a0 ,  , and  ). \n\nWe confirmed that the fpFC obtained from the multiplication of weight feature vectors across the layers performed similarly well as the fpFC from activation maximization, one of the most popular methods for interpreting trained neural networks. This was indicated by the good agreement between the fpFCs obtained by either method (Figure\u00a0 ). Despite substantial overlap of robust edges, differences in fpFC existed between the two methods (Figure\u00a0 ). The fpFC edges between FPN\u2010VAN were found using the activation maximization approach but not by the multiplication of weight matrices. Compared to the activation maximization approach, the weight feature approach may have been lacking the nonlinear information learned by the DNN. It can be concluded that the fpFC from activation maximization would supplement the findings of fpFC from weight feature. However, the weight feature\u2010based approach has the benefit of instant availability once the DNN is trained, without requiring an additional iterative learning procedure. As an alternative to weight feature or activation maximization, explainability tools can be applied to ascertain the fpFC for each individual (i.e., output class) and identify important edges thereafter. For example, tools such as SHAP (Lundberg & Lee,\u00a0 ) or DeepLIFT (Shrikumar et al.,\u00a0 ) can be used to evaluate the influence of each feature on the model output. \n\n\n### Influence of the surface registration scheme \n  \nBecause FC was calculated using the averaged BOLD time series within each ROI, both the degree of alignment of the subject's EPI to a template and the ROI parcellation strategy may have influenced the results. We attempted to minimize potential misalignment by adopting the MMP scheme of MSMAll, which utilizes myelin maps from T1\u2010weighted and T2\u2010weighted images and rfMRI data to match a subject's native space to a group template on the surface. MSMSulc surface registration utilizes only cortical folding patterns (i.e., the sulcal depth) to match the subject's space to the group template. Thus, MSMAll is superior to MSMSulc for inter\u2010subject registration (Bijsterbosch et al.,\u00a0 ; Dubois et al.,\u00a0 ; Glasser et al.,\u00a0 ). The tvFC patterns derived using MSMAll are expected to exhibit a relatively higher degree of authentic and subtle individual\u2010specific FC originating from neural activity by substantially reducing spurious yet relatively obvious individual\u2010specific FC patterns associated with individual\u2010specific anatomical cortical folding patterns (Bijsterbosch et al.,\u00a0 ). This may explain why MSMAll registration resulted in a higher error rate than did MSMSulc (Figure\u00a0 ). Fingerprints of cortical folding patterns during infancy have been reported for use in individual identification (Duan et al.,\u00a0 ). Multimodal fingerprints utilizing both anatomical information from cortical folding patterns and functional information from tvFC patterns may thus further enhance individual identification performance. \n\n\n### Influence of confounding artifacts in the   BOLD   time series \n  \nWe attributed the improvement using ICA\u2010FIX\u2010based time series denoising to the elimination of noise that obscured authentic individual\u2010specific neural activity (Griffanti et al.,\u00a0 ; Salimi\u2010Khorshidi et al.,\u00a0 ; Xifra\u2010Porxas et al.,\u00a0 ). It is likely that cardiac and respiratory\u2010related components had already been mostly removed using ICA\u2010FIX denoising and/or band\u2010pass filtering (0.01\u20130.1\u2009Hz) (Murphy et al.,\u00a0 ) because of additional physiological noise correction via RETROICOR (Glover et al.,\u00a0 ) did not alter the performance. It may be worth employing alternative physiological noise correction techniques such as ANATICOR (Jo et al.,\u00a0 ). The fact that individuals with high head motions showed inferior performance than those with low head motions suggests that individual identification using the DNN was not based on the head motion\u2010related artifacts in the BOLD signals. \n\nUsing our DNNs, the test performance was consistently better than the validation performance (Figure\u00a0 ). To interpret this finding, we conducted PM to evaluate the possibility that the tvFC patterns from the training data (R\u2010L and L\u2010R phase\u2010encoded rfMRI data on Day 1) were more similar to the test data (L\u2010R phase\u2010encoded rfMRI data on Day 2) than to the validation data (R\u2010L phase\u2010encoded rfMRI data on Day 2). PM results indicate that the error rates for the test data (91.4, 83.2, 65.8, 31.2, and 22.2% for windows of 15\u2009s, 30\u2009s, 1\u2009min, 3\u2009min, and 5\u2009min, respectively) were lower than the error rates for the validation data (91.9, 84.2, 68.8, 40.8, and 29.5%). On Day 2, two rfMRI runs with the L\u2010R and R\u2010L phase\u2010encoding had been consecutively acquired in order (Smith et al.,\u00a0 ). Since each run lasted about 15\u2009min, there was a reasonable chance that participants might have been drowsy during the later run (i.e., the R\u2010L phase\u2010encoding) (Tagliazucchi & Laufs,\u00a0 ). Thus, the lower degree of vigilance and the higher likelihood of falling asleep might have degraded the quality of tvFCs in the validation set (Allen et al.,\u00a0 ; Tagliazucchi & Laufs,\u00a0 ). Alternatively, the effect might be due to the varying signal quality depending on the phase\u2010encoding directions. Previous research suggests that the difference between R\u2010L or L\u2010R direction of phase\u2010encoding induces asymmetric dropout in the fMRI signal (Omidvarnia et al.,\u00a0 ; Smith et al.,\u00a0 ). Specifically, the R\u2010L phase\u2010encoding direction is known to have a more severe dropout in the left hemisphere than the L\u2010R phase\u2010encoding direction, which might lead to increased distortion of the FC edges in the left hemisphere under that encoding (Mori et al.,\u00a0 ). This may therefore constitute another possible explanation of the slightly increased error rates from the test data compared to the validation data. \n\n\n### Generalization to an independent dataset \n  \nFine\u2010tuning the classification of varying numbers of target subjects can be achieved through the utilization of our pretrained DNN from the input layer to the last hidden layer, coupled with the incorporation of a new output layer. This method is effective as the fpFC for each individual can be uniquely identified through feature extraction using our DNN. More specifically, as previously noted, the fpFCs of a single subject demonstrated considerable consistency across DNN models trained on different quantities of target subjects (i.e., 300 and 600) (Figure\u00a0 ). Additionally, our findings demonstrate the capacity of our pretrained DNN to employ transfer learning for predicting a larger population of target subjects (Figures\u00a0  and  ). Given the identification of important and robust FC edges for individual classification, we postulate that our DNN model, pretrained with the HCP dataset, can be effectively adapted for classifying alternative sets of subjects by fine\u2010tuning the pretrained DNN. Nonetheless, the number of subjects substantially exceeding the quantity of hidden nodes (i.e., 2000 in our study) may lead to challenges due to the possibility of underrepresented feature representations when the hidden nodes are outnumbered by output nodes. To mitigate this, expanding the network's capacity while maintaining a constant count of input nodes by adopting techniques that ensure over\u2010complete representation at the hidden nodes (Jiang et al.,\u00a0 ; Le et al.,\u00a0 ; Vincent et al.,\u00a0 ) could be a promising strategy. \n\nWe generalized our DNN model trained using the HCP rfMRI dataset to a rfMRI dataset acquired from our institute. Despite the significantly higher error rates for the data collected from our institute compared with those for the HCP data (Figures\u00a0  and  ), the resulting performance was significantly better than would be expected by chance. Compared to the scenario of freezing hidden layers, fine\u2010tuning all layers of the DNN enabled the fine\u2010grained adjustment of model parameters for the samples in the new dataset. Consequently, fine\u2010tuning substantially reduced error rates for both datasets. Moreover, fine\u2010tuning resulted in much faster convergence but marginally lower error rates for the 15\u2010s window and similar convergence speed but substantially lower error rates for the 30\u2010s window, when compared to the DNN trained with randomly initialized parameters. This demonstrated the advantage of transfer learning in the prediction of an unseen dataset by increasing the generalization performance of the DNN. \n\nThe lower performance compared to the HCP data may not be due to the limited capability of our DNN model but rather to the lower quality of our rfMRI measurements, which were taken using inferior hardware specifications. We used a 3\u2009T Trio MRI scanner for our institute data, while the HCP data is from a Connectome Skyra scanner. We also used a 12\u2010channel head coil, while a 32\u2010channel head coil was used for the HCP data. Our acceleration factor for parallel imaging was 4 (i.e., MB factor of 2 and GRAPPA) compared with 8 for the HCP (MB factor\u2009=\u20098, GRAPPA off). Due to this lower acceleration factor, we increased the TR to 1.44\u2009s for our data (compared to 0.72\u2009s for the HCP) and increased the voxel size to 3\u2009mm isotropic (compared to 2\u2009mm isotropic for the HCP). \n\n\n### Potential weaknesses and further works \n  \nOur study does not include a comparison with recent works on individual identification via FC patterns, which presents a challenge in comparing performance metrics without bias due to variables such as dataset disparities, subject quantity, preprocessing procedures, and variations in temporal window lengths. Previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between individual\u2010specific features in static FC and fluid intelligence levels (Finn et al.,\u00a0 ), and an association between features in dynamic FCs and cognitive task performance (Fong et al.,\u00a0 ). Consequently, a promising avenue for future research is to explore the potential connections between the fpFC identified in our investigation and cognitive or behavioral attributes. Our findings, which indicate a greater similarity among genetically close individuals and inferior classification performance in classifying individuals from the HCP dataset to those from our institution using transfer learning, suggest that our DNN model could facilitate meaningful classifications. For example, a DNN trained to classify a specific clinical cohort might be deployed to determine whether new individuals correlate with that clinical group or control samples, based on the prediction performance of the transfer learning scheme. Alternatively, clustering of the fpFC patterns or hidden representations could reveal potential sub\u2010groups within the training samples, using the DNN designed for individual classification. \n\nWe only utilized BOLD signals from the cerebral cortical areas. The subcortical regions and cerebellum have also been reported to play a range of critical functional roles, from those essential for living to those associated with high\u2010level cognitive processes, such as coordinating thought (Koziol et al.,\u00a0 ). Future research that can systematically evaluate the importance of FNs across the cerebral cortex, subcortex, and cerebellum is thus warranted (Van De Ville et al.,\u00a0 ). The FC of rfMRI data measures simultaneous co\u2010activation across ROIs using BOLD signals that measure neural activity indirectly via neurovascular coupling between brain tissue and blood vessels (Huettel et al.,\u00a0 ). Therefore, it is important to determine whether the main contributor to individual identification using tvFC patterns is distinct and individual\u2010specific characteristics associated with spontaneous neural activity during a resting state or those associated with the hemodynamic response function representing neurovascular coupling (Buxton et al.,\u00a0 ; Gonzalez\u2010Castillo et al.,\u00a0 ; Handwerker et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nBecause we used nonoverlapping windows in calculating tvFC patterns from BOLD signals, the number of training samples varied by window length since the scan duration was fixed. Despite the expectation that each FC pattern would be less noisy and clearer under a given longer versus a shorter window length, we observed a higher error rate for a 5\u2010min window (0.2%) than for a 3\u2010min window (0.1%). This may potentially be due to overfitting caused by the smaller number of training samples for the 5\u2010min window than for the 3\u2010min window. Thus, an interesting and important question is whether there is an optimal window length for individual identification using DNN if the number of samples is identical across different window lengths. Our motivation for using nonoverlapping rectangular windows was to reduce potential dependency between adjacent tvFC patterns caused by partially overlapping/shared BOLD signals between consecutive temporal windows. Alternatively, it would also be possible to adopt a standard approach of sliding a window with a temporal overlap between the BOLD signal segments since the training, validation, and test samples are separated by the fMRI sessions. This will increase the number of training samples that may work as data augmentation schemes for the DNN training, which may alleviate a potential overfitting issue. Additionally, alternative window shapes such as Tapered Gaussian or Hanning windows can be utilized to further reduce potential discontinuity and/or abrupt changes between tvFC patterns (Preti et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nWe endeavored to validate the DNN's identification performance and to ascertain reliable edges by iterative training across numerous cycles. It is worth noting, however, that there could still be the risk of underspecification. This suggests that our model may not have found an overarching, generalized solution applicable across various domains, or there may exist alternative solutions capable of addressing the problem (D'Amour et al.,\u00a0 ). In this context, future research aimed at mitigating the risk of underspecification risk is warranted. There are important alternative options beyond our proposed method of weight sparsity optimization to prevent overfitting DNNs and to improve their performance. For example, transfer learning has become feasible owing to the availability of extensive open fMRI datasets such as ABCD (Casey et al.,\u00a0 ), UK Biobank (Sudlow et al.,\u00a0 ), and Healthy Brain Network Biobank (Alexander et al.,\u00a0 ). This approach may involve the direct transfer of task\u2010related knowledge (in our case, individual identity) through supervised pretraining\u2010based transfer learning, or the acquisition and transfer of knowledge unrelated to the downstream task from the source data via self\u2010supervised pretraining\u2010based transfer learning. Studies have shown that implementing transfer learning in deep learning models using fMRI data has enhanced model performance on downstream tasks (Hwang et al.,\u00a0 ; Li et al.,\u00a0 ; Rahman et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nEach output unit in our DNN represents a distinct individual in our training dataset; therefore, the model cannot incorporate individuals outside of this dataset. Specifically, the FC pattern of an unrecognized individual will be classified as the most similar existing individual in the training set based on the closest matching fpFC. This approach is suboptimal for individual classification across a broader population when the trained DNN is applied. To address this shortcoming, integrating an out\u2010of\u2010distribution (OOD) detection module into the DNN has been proposed, which is in line with recent discussions estimating uncertainty within deep learning models (Hendrycks & Gimpel,\u00a0 ; Yang et al.,\u00a0 ). Enhancing our DNN with an OOD detection module that includes a confidence score could substantially improve the model's reliability for individual identification. Finally, our DNN model was a fully connected NN and thus received 1D vectorized off\u2010diagonal elements of the FC matrix as input. Our model architecture may hence be limited in accommodating the 3D structure of the brain. Future studies using a deep learning model more suitable for dealing with FC data are warranted. For example, a graph neural network incorporating the brain's topological architecture or LSTM/RNN to account for temporal changes could be used to evaluate whether the prediction performance and identified fpFCs can be further optimized (Farahani et al.,\u00a0 ; Kawahara et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nOur study offers an insight into the discovery of the intrinsic mode of the human brain using whole\u2010brain resting\u2010state FC and weight\u2010sparsity\u2010controlled DNNs. This study evaluated the identification performance of 100\u2013870 target subjects (depending on the scenario), while mainly focusing on 300 subjects. We demonstrated that a DNN can enhance accuracy by systematically comparing its performance with alternative approaches across different scenarios of window lengths and numbers of target subjects to identify. Moreover, we evaluated the reliability and robustness of the fpFC across the varying configurations and interpreted our findings in the context of functional connectome. We also raised the possibility that genotypical characteristics are reflected in the phenotypical traits of tvFC using stratified groups based on their genetic relatedness. In addition, the feasibility of generalizing a DNN model trained using HCP data to an independent dataset acquired from our institute was demonstrated in the context of transfer learning. Finally, our study is valuable in that it extends the investigation of FC fingerprinting to several hundreds of subjects (870 in this study) compared to the limited number of subjects in the previous works (Finn et al.,\u00a0 ; Liu et al.,\u00a0 ; Van De Ville et al.,\u00a0 ).

Although IPS scores are associated with health and well-being, neural changes that underlie IPS impairments in MS are not understood. Resting state fMRI can provide insight into brain function changes underlying impairment in persons with MS. \n\n\n## Objectives \n  \nWe aimed to assess functional connectivity (FC) differences in (i) persons with MS compared to healthy controls (HC), (ii) persons with both MS and CI (MS-CI) compared to HC, (iii) persons with MS that are cognitively preserved (MS-CP) compared to HC, (iv) MS-CI compared to MS-CP, and (v) in relation to cognition within the MS group. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe included 107 participants with MS (age 49.5\u2009\u00b1\u200912.9, 82% women), and 94 controls (age 37.9\u2009\u00b1\u200915.4, 66% women). Each participant was administered the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and underwent a resting state fMRI scan. The MS-CI group was created by applying a   z  -score cut-off of  \u22121.5 to locally normalized SDMT scores. The MS-CP group was created by applying a   z  -score of \u22650. Control groups (HC  and HC ) were based on the nearest age-matched HC participants. A whole-brain ROI-to-ROI analysis was performed followed by specific contrasts and a regression analysis. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIndividuals with MS showed FC differences compared to HC that involved the cerebellum, visual and language-associated brain regions, and the thalamus, hippocampus, and basal ganglia. The MS-CI showed FC differences compared to HC  that involved the cerebellum, visual and language-associated areas, thalamus, and caudate. SDMT scores were correlated with FC between the cerebellum and lateral occipital cortex in MS. No differences were observed between the MS-CP and HC  or MS-CI and MS-CP groups. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur findings emphasize FC changes of cerebellar, visual, and language-associated areas in persons with MS. These differences were apparent for (i) all MS participants compared to HC, (ii) MS-CI subgroup and their matched controls, and (iii) the association between FC and SDMT scores within the MS group. Our findings strongly suggest that future work that examines the associations between FC and IPS impairments in MS should focus on the involvement of these regions. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease that can cause multiple symptoms including cognitive impairment. Many individuals with MS develop impaired cognitive function, and the domain of information processing speed is affected most often in up to 51% of individuals ( ). Cognitive impairment is important. In a longitudinal study of newly diagnosed individuals with MS, cognitive impairment in the form of reduced information processing speed (IPS) was associated with an increased risk of changing vocation or ceasing work ( ). The neural pathophysiology underlying impaired IPS in MS is not fully understood. \n\nResting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) measures brain activity data while the participant is not performing a task. Analyses of the temporal correlations between activity in different brain regions provide measures of functional connectivity (FC) ( ,  ). Whereas structural connectivity techniques assess the physical connection between two anatomical areas, FC speaks to the synchronicity of fluctuations in brain activity across different regions and is thought to reflect a functional relationship. A review of 86 FC studies comparing individuals with MS and healthy controls (HC) ( ) reported that MS patients exhibit patterns of altered FC involving the thalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, amygdala, and medial temporal lobes, and reduced FC of the visual (VIS), sensorimotor (SMN), and default mode networks (DMN). \n\nAltered FC of the thalamus, hippocampus, and temporal cortex, as well as regions associated with frontoparietal (FP), dorsal attention (DA), and DMN networks, has been linked to global cognitive impairment in MS ( ). However, the literature on impaired IPS is inconsistent: the direction of FC change varies between studies ( ,  ). Some previous rs-fMRI studies have found an association between IPS scores and FC measures in persons with MS ( ) while others have not ( ). The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) measures IPS, and is recommended for screening of cognition in the clinical setting ( ,  ). One rs-fMRI study has used a cutoff score of less than \u22121.5 SD below HC average on the SDMT to define a group with impaired IPS ( ). The authors found increased FC for MS participants with impaired IPS as compared to those with preserved IPS. However, this study only reported global FC, and FC between specific brain regions was not described. In light of the inconsistencies across the literature to date, the association between FC and IPS in MS remains to be clearly defined. \n\nTo that end, we aimed to examine whether changes in FC could be observed using a whole-brain region-of-interest approach, comparing participants with MS and HC. In line with previous literature, we compared FC more broadly by contrasting all patients with MS to all HC, with both groups exhibiting an unrestricted range of cognitive capabilities. We hypothesized that, relative to HC, MS participants would show altered (either higher or lower) FC involving thalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, amygdala, and medial temporal lobes, as well as altered FC involving brain regions commonly associated with VIS, SMN, and DMN functional networks. Next, we performed three different comparisons to characterise the association between FC and IPS impairment in MS. First, we compared participants with MS and CI (MS-CI) to approximately age-matched controls (HC ). Since previous work that examined IPS using the SDMT has reported inconsistent results, we formed preliminary hypotheses based on previously reported FC changes in individuals with MS with global CI\u2014we hypothesized that the MS-CI group would show altered FC in thalamus, hippocampus, temporal cortex, and regions associated with the FP, DA, and DMN. Second, to identify MS-related differences in FC that exist in the absence of cognitive impairment, we compared FC between cognitively preserved participants with MS (MS-CP) and approximately age-matched HC (HC ). Finally, to assess how FC relates to cognitive impairment exclusively within MS, we contrasted the MS-CI and MS-CP groups. Given that prior research has not restricted comparisons of FC specifically between cognitively preserved MS participants to cognitively preserved HC, or IPS impairment within MS, these last two contrasts were exploratory in nature. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants with MS were enrolled from a larger prospective longitudinal study of psychiatric comorbidity in immune-mediated inflammatory disorders ( ). A subgroup of participants with MS were recruited for this sub-study ( ) and underwent additional neuroimaging, cognitive, and psychiatric testing. Expanded Disability Status Scores ( ), lesion load, and disease duration was recorded for participants in the MS group. Participants were excluded if they had comorbid neurodegenerative disease or brain tumors, or if they had any MRI contraindications. The sub-study also recruited healthy controls who did not have any chronic health conditions, history of head injury, or chronic medication use apart from oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy. All participants provided written consent and were required to have sensorimotor function adequate to perform the cognitive tests, have sufficient English language knowledge to undergo the test protocol, and were aged 18\u2009years or older. \n\n\n### Cognition \n  \nCognitive testing included the Weschler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) ( ) and the oral form of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) ( ). The WTAR assessed premorbid intelligence ( ). The SDMT is the most commonly used test of information processing speed in MS ( ), and is a component of the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) test battery ( ). We used local regression-based age-, sex-, and education-adjusted SDMT scores ( ) to compare the MS and HC samples. The cognitively preserved (MS-CP) group included individuals with MS whose SDMT   z  -score was \u22650 standard deviations (SD) of the HC reference group. The MS-CI group included individuals with SDMT   z  -scores <\u22121.5SD below the HC mean ( ). The nearest age-matched participants from our HCs were selected to form control groups for the MS-CI and MS-CP groups (labeled HC  and HC , respectively). \n\n\n### Data acquisition and analysis \n  \nThe acquisition parameters and the preprocessing, denoising, and initial data analyses are described in detail in our previously published protocol paper ( ). Briefly, images were collected using a 3\u2009T Siemens TIM Trio MRI system. Anatomical T -weighted images were acquired using the MPRAGE sequence. T -weighted FLAIR scans were acquired for subsequent lesion detection. Resting state fMRI was acquired using the Human Connectome Project \u201ccmrr_mbep2d_bold\u201d sequence with an acquisition time of 7:12\u2009min. Lesion segmentation was completed with the Lesion Segmentation Tool in SPM12, and lesion masking and filling were accomplished in FSL. Lesion-filled MS structural raw data and HC structural raw data were entered into the processing pipeline. Functional data for MS and HC were processed identically. In brief, rs-fMRI data were spatially preprocessed using SPM12 which included removal of the first 10 brain volumes, realignment, distortion correction, coregistration to MNI space, and smoothing with a 4.0\u2009mm full-width half-maximum 3D Gaussian kernel. The images were then imported to the CONN toolbox (version 18b) ( ) for subsequent pre-preprocessing. The scan-to-scan change in average BOLD signal within the global-mean mask was scaled to standard deviations and changes of >5 standard deviations were flagged as outliers which were included as a first-level covariate for scrubbing. Using the Artifact Detection Tool ( ) (ART) within CONN, time points with default values of volume-to-volume intensity changes of   z  \u2009>\u20093.0, values of rotational motion of >0.05 degrees in any plane and/or translational motion >0.50\u2009mm in any direction were identified. The estimated subject-motion parameters were regressed from the data in the denoising step of the preprocessing pipeline. To minimize motion-related variability in the BOLD signal, the 3 rotation and 3 translation parameters, plus their associated first-order derivatives, were regressed from the BOLD signal timeseries. The time-course of eroded white matter and cerebrospinal fluid were similarly regressed from the BOLD signal timeseries to correct for physiological noise. A temporal band-pass filter (0.008\u20130.09\u2009Hz) was used to isolate only low frequency fluctuations ( ). \n\n\n### Analysis \n  \nWe summarized participant characteristics using descriptive statistics, and compared groups using chi-square tests, Student\u2019s   t  -tests, and Mann\u2013Whitney U tests as appropriate. \n\nFunctional connectivity analysis was performed using brain parcellations included with CONN software ( ). The CONN atlas includes 132 ROIs which are an amalgamation of the Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical structural atlas ( ) and the cerebellar portions of the AAL atlas ( ). An ROI-to-ROI analysis was used to calculate the bivariate correlations between each pair of ROIs using the General Linear Model (GLM, correlation (bivariate) settings, no weighting applied). First, we performed the broader between-subjects contrast [MS (1) HC (\u22121)] controlling for age and sex. Second, we performed the contrast comparing cognitively impaired MS patients with HC, controlling for sex [MS-CI (1) HC  (\u22121)]. Third, we performed the contrast comparing cognitively preserved MS patients and HC, controlling for sex [MS-CP (1) HC  (\u22121)]. Finally, we contrasted the cognitively impaired MS participants with cognitively preserved MS participants [MS-CI (1) MS-CP (\u22121)]. Significant ROI-to-ROI connections were thresholded by intensity at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate ( ). \n\n\n### Association between FC and SDMT scores in the MS group \n  \nA linear regression analysis was run for the MS group alone, identifying the association between the FC and the MS group\u2019s SDMT scores (controlling for age). The ROI-to-ROI connection threshold was set to   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe included 107 participants with MS and 94 controls after excluding 4 participants with MS and 6 HC participants due to insufficient MRI data quality.

The remaining pairwise differences involved cerebellar or subcortical ROIs. \n\nThe single pairwise difference that showed higher FC for the MS-CI group compared to their matched control group involved an ROI associated with language processing. \n\nOverall, in terms of associated function, 6 pairings involved an ROI associated with visual processing, 3 pairings involved an ROI associated with language processing, and 6 of the pairwise differences involved a cerebellar lobule which is associated with cognition ( ). \n\nWe did not find any differences in FC between the MS-CP group and matched controls (HC ). \n\nWe did not find any differences in FC between the MS-CI and the MS-CP groups. \n\n\n### Association between FC and SDMT scores in the MS group \n  \nOne pairwise connection was significantly correlated with the SDMT scores in the MS group. FC between the left cerebellum 9 and the left inferior division of the lateral occipital cortex ROIs was observed (  T  \u2009=\u20094.72, pFDR\u2009=\u20090.039). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe observed FC differences between MS patients and HC relative to ROIs in known visual- and language-related regions, as well as for ROIs in the cerebellar vermis. We also found widespread FC differences involving thalamic, hippocampal, and striatal areas, in line with previous studies. Similarly, in the MS-CI group compared to nearest age-matched controls, we observed altered FC in the cerebellar lobules, visual and language-related regions, as well as the thalamus and striatum. The results of our regression analysis reinforce these findings identifying one significant ROI pairing between the cerebellar 9 lobule and lateral occipital cortex related to cognition in the MS group. No differences between the MS-CP and HC  groups were found, nor for the MS-CI and MS-CP groups. \n\nOur analysis showed lower FC between cerebellar vermis 7, 9, and 10 and thalamic, hippocampal, paracingulate, and visual-related regions. The vermis is located along the midline of the cerebellum, and is usually associated with balance, posture, and coordination of eye movement ( ,  ). Cerebellar involvement in MS often relates to motor dysfunction ( ). However, the vermis has been implicated in affective processing across many clinical populations ( ), and the vermis 9 and 10 make up a region that has been described as the \u201climbic cerebellum\u201d ( ). We also found lower FC between the left superior parietal lobule and cerebellar crus 1, which is located on the posterior lobe of the cerebellum and has been implicated in the cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), characterized by executive function, linguistic, spatial, and affective difficulties ( ,  ). Other work has implicated disruption of the cerebellar crus 1 in difficulties with language processing, mental rotation, and executive function ( ). Our work reinforces recent descriptions of the role of the cerebellum in cognitive function in MS ( ). Given its widespread involvement in various cognitive domains, the posterior cerebellum may be of interest in future studies of cognition in MS. \n\nWe also found FC differences in regions associated with the language network. This is one of the first to show a multitude of differences in FC in the MS group between language-related regions, and visual, caudate, and cingulate areas. There was increased FC between language-related and visual regions. For example, several visual areas (SCC, lingual gyrus) showed higher FC with the temporooccipital part of the middle temporal gyrus (toMTG) bilaterally, a region that is implicated in language comprehension and syntactic processing ( ). While VIS network disruption has been noted in many studies ( ), our findings emphasize increased FC between specific visual and language areas. This may be of consequence clinically; many of the cognitive measures used to assess MS, like the SDMT for IPS or other common tests for memory or executive function ( ,  ), rely on visual processing and language to a large degree. It may be that increased FC between visual and language-related areas represents a network-level adaptation to structural damage, as put forward in the network collapse model of MS ( ). Future studies that aim to measure the association between FC change in MS and a specific cognitive domain should account for visual or language-related cognitive difficulties in the study design. \n\nAs hypothesized based on prior findings ( ), we observed altered FC in the MS group compared to controls in the thalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and middle temporal lobes; the only hypothesized region which did not show differences in FC was the amygdala. However, our findings typify the literature: we identified significant differences in FC at commonly cited ROIs. In addition, we found different patterns of FC. For example, previous work on the thalamus has described increased FC with motor, occipital, temporal, and subcortical areas. By contrast, we found lower FC between the bilateral thalamus and cerebellar vermis 9, and lower FC between the left thalamus and right caudate. So too do we find this with the hippocampus: where some authors report the opposite ( ), we found lower FC between the hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens. Our findings in the basal ganglia agree with the more detailed FC analysis of the striatum conducted by Cui and coauthors ( ). We identified lower FC between the right caudate and putamen. However, our analysis differs from theirs in that we showed increased FC between the right caudate and the inferior frontal gyrus and they did not, while they reported many alterations in FC in the MS group that we do not. \n\nWe found widespread altered FC in brain regions associated with the VIS network that are consistent with previous work, though the direction of FC differences varies ( ). These included V1 (intra- and supracalcarine cortex), the occipital pole, fusiform cortex, and lingual gyri. In contrast with previous work, we did not see altered FC in any regions associated with the DMN or SMN. While this is surprising given the number of studies which report on these networks, no consensus on the nature and direction of altered FC of the DMN or SMN in MS has been reached ( ,  ). \n\nBased on previous studies, we did not expect to see changes in FC at regions other than those that are associated with the VIS, DMN, or SMN. However, we found increased FC in the MS group between the left planum temporale, a region involved in complex auditory and speech processing ( ,  ) and the anterior cingulate gyrus (AC), a region involved in assessing the reward value of actions ( ). The AC is considered to be part of the salience network (SN), which functions to orient attention towards relevant stimuli. Within the SN, the AC is particularly responsible for generating motor, cognitive, and behavioural responses to those stimuli ( ). That the SN is implicated in MS-related cognitive dysfunction agrees with a recent graph theory study ( ), but their results do not name the AC specifically. \n\n### Cognitive impairment \n  \nIn the group of MS-CI individuals with impaired IPS, we showed altered FC in the cerebellum, thalamus, and basal ganglia, as well as areas associated with VIS and LAN networks. Current literature on associations between FC and IPS is contradictory, with conflicting findings on the correlation between SDMT scores and FC measures ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Using a definition of the MS-CI group that is similar to our own ( ,  ), Meijer et al. ( ) examined the difference between CI and CP groups in whole-brain FC and structure. They reported that, alongside worsened structural integrity and reduced deep brain grey matter volume, their CI group also showed an increased FC metric compared to CP individuals with MS. Given the differences in study methodology and that the authors did not include the cerebellum in their analysis, only limited comparisons are possible. We found mainly lowered FC between cerebellar lobules and visual ROIs in our MS-CI group, as well as increased FC between right aMTG and the subcallosal cortex. More work that explores specific brain regions in an MS-CI group is needed. \n\nThere were FC changes in common at 2 ROI pairs between the analysis of all MS and HC, and the analysis of our MS-CI group compared to nearest age-matched controls. Both the MS group and the MS-CI group had lower FC between left occipital pole and right SCC and lower FC between left thalamus and cerebellar vermis 9. These results are consistent with previous systematic reviews which indicate altered FC involving thalamic and visual areas in MS ( ,  ). They also reinforce the results of the first analysis we performed by indicating the same cerebellar, thalamic, and visual ROIs. In contrast, we also found altered FC between 9 ROI pairs in the MS-CI group that were not implicated, pairwise, by the analysis of the entire MS group. It is notable that 8 of the 9 ROI pairs involved lower FC of cerebellar ROIs with subcortical, visual, and language-related regions. Similarly, the connection between the left cerebellar 9 lobule and the inferior lateral occipital cortex being related to SDMT scores in the MS group complements the finding from the group-wise comparisons highlighting the relevance of FC between cerebellar and visual cortex to impaired cognition in MS. \n\nWe propose that regions of FC change in common between MS versus HC and MS-CI versus HC  (i.e., thalamus, cerebellar vermis 7 and 9, OP, SCC) may represent the FC changes that are common to individuals with MS. A larger sample size of cognitively preserved individuals with MS may then detect changes in these same common regions. The additional regions present only in the MS-CI vs. HC  contrast (i.e., cerebellum 6, 7b, 8) may represent a signature of additional IPS impairment. FC of cerebellar lobule 9 was implicated in impaired cognition in MS, based on the results of our linear regression of SDMT scores in the MS group. These posterior cerebellar lobules should be used as seeds in follow-up analyses that examine the relationship between FC and IPS in individuals with MS. While we observed ROI pairings that significantly differed between cognitively impaired participants with MS and age-matched healthy controls, these results were less robust than those observed in the overall MS vs. HC contrast. We speculate that this may be due to a combination of the fact that (1) the contrast between cognitively impaired participants with MS and healthy controls provides a narrower reflection of differences between MS and healthy state, relative to the FC underlying information processing speed impairment and (2) the contrast between cognitively impaired MS participants and their matched healthy controls included a smaller sample size for the contrast groups, compared to the overall MS vs. HC contrast. Thus, this contrast had less power to detect group differences than the overall MS vs. HC contrast. With a larger sample size of cognitively impaired participants with MS and controls, it may be possible to detect additional differences. In addition, larger sample sizes of cognitively impaired MS participants would support analyses focused on individual variability and associations between MS, FC, and cognitive impairment. Future work should attempt to replicate these findings in larger, more diverse samples, and should investigate the network properties of these regions. We expect that this will bring further insight into the FC changes that underlie MS-related declines in IPS. \n\nThe contrast between HC and participants with MS and CI cannot distinguish FC differences related exclusively to CI from those related to MS, given that the groups varied both in their cognitive status as well as by MS status. This was the rationale for including the contrast of the cognitively preserved MS participants and their matched healthy controls, and the contrast of the cognitively intact vs. cognitively preserved participants within the MS group. Our results did not isolate FC differences specific to MS without cognitive impairment in our comparison of cognitively preserved MS patients to HC. Neither did we isolate FC differences specific to cognition impairment in MS in our comparison of cognitively impaired vs. cognitively preserved individuals with MS. The small sample size of the MS-CP group, which was common to both contrasts, may account for this. Future work using a larger sample size of cognitively preserved participants with MS will determine if this is a false negative due to low power. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nWe made attempts to follow the standardization and study quality recommendations from Jandric and coauthors when designing this study, which include the study of phenotype-specific influences, controlling for age, using well-established measures, defining ROIs consistently with previous research, and conducting model-led research ( ). We controlled for age as a covariate of no-interest in our analysis or by age-matching. We used an established and validated cognitive measure and a standard brain atlas for parcellation. We fell short of the recommendations in two ways. The number of MS participants with primary progressive MS and secondary progressive MS was small and we were therefore unable to consider potential differences by MS subtype. However, many studies to date have used either mixed samples or a sample consisting of solely individuals with relapsing-remitting MS ( ). Our samples were appropriate to our aim of describing broad trends in FC that apply across disease subtypes. Finally, we did not design our study to assess a specific disease model; however, we expect that the results obtained here will inform hypotheses for future model-led study designs. For example, much work remains to determine the adaptive vs. maladaptive implications of increases and/or decreases of FC in MS compared to healthy state. Many studies have now identified difference in FC for those with MS compared to the healthy population ( ), however, far fewer studies have examined how resting state FC relates to cognitive impairment in MS ( ,  ). Without longitudinal research to allow assessment of changes over time, in association with changes in cognition, it is challenging to assert whether the differences in FC that we have observed in the present study reflect adaptive (compensatory) vs. maladaptive changes in those with MS. Continued research in this area is necessary to fully elucidate the implications for the difference in FC presently observed. Further, the objective of the present study was to identify differences between those with MS and healthy controls relative to the FC underlying cognitive impairment. Informed by the present findings, future research can and should aim to determine potential causal mechanisms underlying the differences in cognitive-impairment related-FC between those with MS and HC. This could include, for example, exploring how individual variability in measures like lesion load, which are central to the pathology of MS, relate to cognitive impairment and associated differences in FC. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nUsing a whole-brain ROI-to-ROI approach, we found significant differences for FC among those with MS compared to healthy controls, with ROI-pairings involving the affective and cognitive regions of the cerebellum, as well as visual and language-associated regions. Our results were generally concordant with recent findings demonstrating altered FC in subcortical and visual structures in persons with MS, but the precise direction of FC changes was not always consistent. In contrast with previous work, we did not show altered FC at regions associated with the DMN or SMN. We report that individuals with MS and impaired IPS have altered FC of the cerebellum, visual-related, and language-related areas. The regions we identified on the posterior lobe of the cerebellum have not been linked to impairments in IPS in MS previously. We suggest that further work examines the associations between IPS and FC of these regions in persons with MS. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe datasets presented in this article are not readily available because some participants did not agree to data sharing.

Its median age of onset has been reported to be around 40 years. We report herein a case of very-late-onset NMOSD (76 years of age) and try to promote its awareness as a type of neurological deterioration in elder patients. A 76-year-old woman suffering from Parkinson disease was admitted to our hospital because of consciousness disturbance. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed the presence of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery high-signal-intensity lesions in the right peri- and intralateral ventricle. Part of this lesion and the meninges showed gadolinium enhancement. Physical examination revealed the presence of a tumor in the right breast, which was later diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma. In addition, laboratory examinations led to the detection of anti-AQP-4 antibodies in her serum; consequently, the patient was diagnosed as having NMOSD. She received initial pulsed steroid therapy, followed by right mastectomy. Although the patient's consciousness improved significantly, she developed abrupt-onset bilateral leg weakness and multiple longitudinal spinal cord lesions. Additional steroid therapy ameliorated the patient's leg weakness and reduced the swelling of the spinal cord. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nNeuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is characterized by the preferential involvement of the optic nerves and spinal cord with positivity for anti-aquaporin-4 (anti-AQP-4) antibodies [ ,  ]. This disease often presents in the fourth decade of life and exhibits female predominance. In rare instances, NMOSD has been reported in elderly persons (over 50 years of age), and the clinical entity of late-onset NMOSD has been mentioned [ ]. Compared with early-onset NNOSD (below 50 years of age), late-onset NMOSD may exhibit characteristic features, especially those associated with aging or other non-neurological issues [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Here, we report a case of very-late-onset NMOSD in an elderly patient (76 years of age) with breast cancer and Parkinson disease who exhibited an unusual disease course. \n\n\n## Case Report/Case Presentation \n  \nThe patient was a 76-year-old woman who had been suffering from Parkinson disease for 5 years. She had Stage III disease, as assessed using the Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) Scale, and exhibited a stable condition under the control of l-dopa and dopamine agonists. Two weeks prior to admission, the patient became speechless gradually and spent most of the day in bed. Thus, she was admitted to our hospital for further evaluations. The patient exhibited worsening of bradykinesia and cogwheel rigidity. She required guardian's support for everyday life and was diagnosed with H-Y stage IV. She could walk with minimal assistance. Most strikingly, her consciousness level was impaired and estimated to be Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) E3V3M5. Involvement of the cranial nerves or cerebellar dysfunction was not obvious. No clinical evidence obtained at that time indicated the involvement of the spinal cord. In addition to the neurological disturbances, a tumor was observed in the right breast, which was later pathologically proven to be invasive ductal carcinoma. Cranial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed a high-signal-intensity lesion in the right peri- and intralateral ventricle (Fig.  , b). Part of this lesion and the meninges exhibited gadolinium enhancement (Fig.  , d). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination demonstrated the presence of pleocytosis (159 cells/mm ) and an increased protein content (171 mg/dL). A cytological analysis was negative and no significant viral antibody titers were detected. Moreover, no bacterial cultures were obtained. The levels of the myelin basic protein were normal (88 pg/mL; normal <102 pg/mL) and no oligoclonal bands were observed. Anti-AQP-4 antibodies were detected (28.5 U/mL; normal, <3 U/mL) in her serum, whereas various auto-antibodies that indicate paraneoplastic neurological syndromes, such as anti-Yo, anti-Hu, Ro, and others, were negative. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed as having late-onset anti-AQP-4 antibody-positive NMOSD with invasive ductal carcinoma and 5-year history of Parkinson disease. Optic neuritis was not observed at that time. The patient received pulsed steroid therapy as the initial treatment, which improved her consciousness level significantly, to GCS E4V4M6. The abnormal signal alterations on MRI also improved (Fig.  , f). The results of CSF examination indicating the presence of 32 cells/mm  and an elevated protein contents of 100 mg/dL were considered to represent partial improvement. After the initial pulsed steroid treatment, the patient received total mastectomy and further rehabilitation therapy for Parkinson disease. Two weeks after the mastectomy, she developed abrupt-onset bilateral leg weakness and walking difficulties; therefore, involvement of the spinal cord was suspected. MRI of the spinal cord revealed the presence of multiple spindle-shaped T2 high-signal-intensity alterations that were indicative of myelitis (Fig.  , b). Thus, pulsed steroid therapy was administered again, after which the MRI signal alterations of the spinal cord were reduced (Fig.  ) and the patient's leg muscle strength improved. The patient refused further treatment, such as plasma exchange or other immune-modifying medications. Subsequently, the patient was transferred to another hospital for further rehabilitation. \n\n\n## Discussion/Conclusion \n  \nNMOSD is an autoimmune inflammatory central nervous system disorder that is typically associated with longitudinally extensive myelitis and optic neuritis [ ,  ]. Several studies have described the importance of the age at the onset of NMOSD; therefore, clinical differences might exist between late-onset (age at disease onset, >50 years) and early-onset NMOSD (age at disease onset, <50 years) NMOSD. Late-onset NMOSD may often be comorbid with age-related conditions compared with early-onset NMOSD [ ]. Moreover, elderly patients have a tendency for a rapid worsening of their condition and poor response to immunomodulatory therapies [ ,  ]. Therefore, an immediate diagnosis and awareness of the possibility of NMOSD in elderly patients are necessary [ ]. At our institution, 12 cases of anti-AQP-4 antibody-positive NMOSD were confirmed over the past 10 years, with the present case being the oldest patient with NMOSD being followed at our hospital. In this single institution, half of the cases of NMOSD with anti-AQP-4 antibody positivity occurred in patients in their 40s. The age at onset was 50 years in 3 cases and 60 years in 2 cases. There were no other cases of NMOSD with an age at onset >70 years. Moreover, no other NMOSD cases had carcinoma and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson disease. In our case, we also suspected the paraneoplastic neurological symptom as the differential diagnosis, but various anti-neural-specific antibodies associated with paraneoplastic syndrome were not found [ ]. In addition, the spinal cord involvement developed after the mastectomy. Regarding the paraneoplastic neurological symptoms, the initial treatment consisted in the suppression of tumor activity; therefore, its resection was considered to be most effective. The observation that the patient developed new neurological deterioration because of the spinal cord involvement after tumor removal seemed inconsistent with paraneoplastic syndrome. Band-like lesions in the lateral ventricle and the linear enhancement of the ependymal surface of the lateral ventricle were characteristic MRI findings in this case. The meninges were also enhanced. These MRI abnormalities have been previously reported in patients with NMOSD [ ]. Based on these findings, we considered that the newly emerging neurological symptoms observed in the current patient were caused by NMOSD. \n\nIn conclusion, we described the clinical features of a rare case of very-late-onset NMOSD and attempted to promote awareness of NMOSD in elderly patients with neurological deterioration. \n\n\n## Statement of Ethics \n  \nThe patient provided both oral and written informed consent for the publishing of this report (including images). \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors have no conflict of interest to declare. \n\n\n## Funding Sources \n  \nThe authors have no funding sources to disclose. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nY.T. designed the case report and wrote the manuscript.

However, studies included in the   meta  -analysis generally rely on small sample sizes and substantially differ in terms of psychometric scales and neuroimaging methodologies. Therefore, we aimed to identify reliable functional brain connectivity alterations associated with severity of conduct problems using a large sample of adolescents and two measures of conduct problems. In a sample of 1416 children and adolescents, mass-univariate analyses of connectivity measures between 333 cortical parcels were conducted to examine the relationship between resting-state functional cortical-cortical connectome and the severity of conduct problems using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). At a liberal threshold, results showed that the functional brain connectivity significantly associated with conduct problems largely differ between the two scales. Indeed, only 21 pairs of brain regions overlapped between the CBCL and SDQ. Permutation feature importance of these 21 brain connectivity measures revealed that connectivity between precentral/postcentral gyri and lateral prefrontal cortex (both ventral and dorsal) were the most important features in explaining variance in conduct problems. The current study highlights that psychometric measures may yield distinct functional connectivity results. Moreover, severity of conduct problems in children and adolescents was mainly associated with deficient functional connectivity of somatomotor and ventral attention networks indicating potential alterations in motor, cognitive and reward processes. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nConduct disorder (CD) is defined by serious and persistent patterns of behavior that violate the rights of others (i.e., aggressive, and rule-breaking behaviors) ( ). It has been suggested that approximately 5\u00a0% of children will display severe and persistent conduct problems (CP) and meet the criteria for CD ( ,  ). These children are known to display high levels of comorbid psychopathologies such as callous-unemotional traits ( ), but also attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD) symptoms ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Past studies have shown that individuals with CP may demonstrate a variety of neurobiological impairments. Indeed, in a recent   meta  -analysis of functional neuroimaging studies, our research team observed that adolescents and adults exhibiting antisocial behaviors may be characterized by abnormal brain activity during fMRI tasks involving negative emotions processing, social cognition and cognitive control ( ). For example, scientific literature has extensively supported the role of the amygdala, medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, insula and cingulate cortex in our understanding of the neural correlates of CP during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). However, in comparison to other neuroimaging modalities, the functional brain connectivity underpinning CP remains largely understudied. \n\nIn the last decade, researchers have aimed to identify intrinsic functional networks which regroup reliable temporally correlated brain regions at rest. Indeed, these large-scale networks usually include the medial fronto-parietal (e.g. default-mode network), occipital (e.g. medial and lateral visual), pericentral (e.g. sensorimotor, somatomotor), dorsal fronto-parietal (e.g. dorsal attention), lateral fronto-parietal (e.g. cognitive control), midcingulo-insular (e.g. salience, ventral attention, cingulo-opercular) networks ( ,  ,  ,  ). Resting-state functional connectivity has recently gained considerable attention in the investigation of the neurobiological mechanisms involved in antisocial behaviors. In a recent   meta  -analysis of resting-state functional connectivity studies, we found that antisocial subjects exhibited prominent alterations in functional connectivity in nodes of the Default Mode Network (i.e., ventro- and dorso-medial PFC and posterior cingulate cortex), Dorsal Attention (i.e., Frontal eye field) and Ventral Attention regions (i.e., anterior midcingulate cortex/pre-supplementary motor area) as well as in the amygdala ( ). Using data from the ABCD study (n\u00a0=\u00a09636), authors have recently showed that the severity of CP was significantly associated with average within-connectivity in the Dorsal Attention, whereas reduced connectivity within the Default Mode Network was rather associated with callous-unemotional traits ( ). Similarly, reduced PCC-vmPFC connectivity (within-Default Mode Netwrok) was found in inmates with compared to those without psychopathic traits ( ). However, some recent   meta  -analytic evidence suggests that dysconnectivity of the Default Mode Network may not be specific to CP or callous-unemotional traits but may rather act as a transdiagnostic neurobiological markers ( ). These results justify the need to search for specific neurobiological markers of CP. \n\nGrowing evidence suggests that antisocial behaviors may be mostly associated with impairments of between- rather than within-network connectivity. In a large sample of adults (n\u00a0=\u00a01003), some researchers have found that anger-aggression was mainly correlated with connectivity between the PCC (Default Mode Network) and Visual, Somatomotor and Ventral Attention as well as between the Fronto-Parietal and Somatomotor ( ). Antisocial behaviors appear to be also associated with deficient functional connectivity between Ventral Attention regions and Default Mode Network ( ) and Frontoparietal ( ) as well as between the Dorsal Attention and Default Mode Network and Ventral Attention ( ). An increasing number of studies also indicate that antisocial behaviors (e.g., aggression) may be mainly related with altered resting-state connectivity between the amygdala and brain regions involved in the Default Mode Network ( ,  ), Frontoparietal and Ventral Attention networks ( ). Overall, these results indicate that most of the resting-state connectivity alterations are found between the Default Mode Network, Dorsal and Ventral Attention and Somatomotor. In comparison with other pediatric psychiatric disorders, several brain connectivity (e.g., Default Mode Network) associated with CP are also reported in ADHD ( ), anxiety ( ) and depressive ( ) disorders. Once again, these highlight the importance of clarifying the deficits in resting-state connectivity that may be specifically associated with antisocial behaviors, compared to other psychopathologies. \n\nDespite the relevance of the above-mentioned findings, there are several limitations that tamper scientific progress in the field. First, there are discrepancies in results across studies which may be explained by different methodologies such as restricting analyses to   a priori   defined seeds (e.g., amygdala) or a limited number of large-scale networks (e.g., Default Mode Network). Likewise, the diversity of psychometric scales used to assess antisocial behaviors and CP may contribute to discrepant results. Studies on resting-state functional connectivity usually include small sample sizes (median: 22 subjects, see  ), which may increase the false positive rate. Recently, some have argued that in resting-state functional connectivity investigations, stability and reproducibility in brain-behavior relationships may require thousands of individuals ( ), thus highlighting the need for larger sample size to investigate the neural correlates of CP. \n\nTherefore, the purpose of the study was twofold. First, we aimed to address these issues by investigating the cortico-cortical and amygdala-cortical functional connectivity at rest associated with two distinct measures of CP, using a large sample of 1416 children and adolescents. We hypothesized that CP will be associated with disrupted functional connectivity within-Default Mode Network, and between Default Mode Network and Dorsal Attention, Ventral Attention, Somatomotor networks, as well as between the amygdala and these networks. Then, as exploratory analyses, we examined whether the significant brain connectivity associated with CP may also be related to other psychopathologies such as irritability, ADHD symptoms and callous-unemotional traits. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants and neuroimaging acquisition parameters \n  \nData from 2200 participants were obtained from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN), an ongoing initiative in New York area (USA) that aims to investigate heterogeneity and impairment in developmental psychopathology (5\u201321\u00a0years old) ( ). The HBN adopted a community-referred recruitment model in which advertisements was provided to community members, educators, parents. Exclusion criteria were impairments that prevents full participation in the study (e.g., serious neurological disorders, hearing or visual impairments), neurodegenerative disorder, acute encephalopathy, acute intoxication, and serious psychiatric disorders (recent diagnosis of schizophrenia and/or manic episode). Supplemental information is provided elsewhere ( ). \n\nFrom the 2200 participants included in the Data Release 7.0, 1583 participants contained available functional neuroimaging data. Written assent was obtained from participants younger than 18\u00a0years old, and written consent was obtained from their legal guardians. Written informed consent was obtained from participants aged 18 or older prior to enrolling in the study. The original HBN study was approved by the Chesapeake Institutional Review Board (now Advarra Inc., see  ). The current study was approved by the local ethics committee. \n\nMRI acquisition took place at three different sites: mobile 1.5\u00a0T Siemens Avanto in Staten Island, 3\u00a0T Siemens Tim Trio at Rutgers University Brain Imaging Center (RUBIC), and 3\u00a0T Siemens Prisma at the CitiGroup Cornell Brain Imaging Center (CBIC) (acquisition protocols and parameters can be found in *** S1, in ( ) as well as  ). Data at the CBIC were obtained using the same data acquisition protocol implemented at RUBIC. The acquisition of the two resting-state scans lasted 5\u00a0min each, during which participants viewed a fixation cross located at the center of the computer screen. Data for the Siemens Avanto were acquired in a single run lasting 10\u00a0min. \n\n\n### Main assessments \n  \nConduct problems were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CP-CBCL,  ), which comprised 33 items from Aggressive (20 items) and Rule-Breaking (11 items) syndromes scales. Parents rated each item using a 3-point scale (0\u00a0=\u00a0not true to 2\u00a0=\u00a0very true)(\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.93). We also used the 5-item CP scale (2 items on aggressive and 3 on non-aggressive rule-breaking behaviors) of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (CP-SDQ,  ), which showed acceptable internal consistency (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.72). Pearson\u2019s correlation between these two scales of CP revealed moderate-strong association (  r  \u00a0=\u00a00.788). \n\nExploratory analyses were conducted to investigate the association between brain connectivity and irritability, ADHD symptoms and callous-unemotional traits. Irritability was measured using the Parent-report form of the Affective Reactivity Index ( ). This 6-item scale (0\u00a0=\u00a0Not True to 2\u00a0=\u00a0Certainly True) showed excellent internal consistency (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.90). ADHD symptoms were measured using the total score of the parent-report form of the Strengths and Weakness of ADHD-symptoms and Normal-behavior ( ). This scale, which contains 18 items (+3\u00a0=\u00a0Far Below Average to \u22123\u00a0=\u00a0Far Above average), also showed excellent internal consistency (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.95). Finally, callous-unemotional traits were measured using the parent-report form of the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits ( ). In our study, we examined the relationship between brain connectivity and the three subscales of this 24-item questionnaire (i.e., Callousness, Uncaring, and Unemotional traits), separately, given that they are differently associated with CP and externalizing behaviors. Indeed, a recent   meta  -analysis showed that the unemotional subscale was weakly related with externalizing problems, compared to the two other subscales ( ). The Callousness (e.g., \u2018  Shows no remorse\u2019  , \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.74), Uncaring (e.g., reversed \u2018  Tries not to hurt others\u2019 feelings\u2019  , \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.84) and Unemotional (e.g., \u2018  Does not show emotions\u2019  , \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.79) subscales demonstrated good internal consistency. \n\n\n### fMRI data preprocessing \n  \nFunctional images were realigned, corrected for motion artifacts with the Artifact Detection Tool ( )(ART, setting a threshold of 0.9\u00a0mm subject ART\u2019s composite motion and a global signal threshold of Z\u00a0=\u00a05) with the implemented in CONN Toolbox ( ), bandpass filtered (0.01\u00a0Hz\u00a0<\u00a0f\u00a0<\u00a00.10\u00a0Hz) and co-registered to the corresponding anatomical image. The anatomical images were segmented (into grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid) and normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotaxic space. Functional images were then normalized based on structural data, spatially smoothed with a 6\u00a0mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) 3D isotropic Gaussian kernel and resampled to 2\u00a0mm  voxels. For the preprocessing, the anatomical component-based noise correction method (aCompCor strategy,  ), was employed to remove confounding effects from the BOLD time series, such as the physiological noise originating from the white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. This method was found to increase the validity and sensitivity of analyses ( ). In the current study, preprocessed images were manually checked for each of the 1583 participants. We found pre-processing issues due to the poor quality of images in 108 participants, which resulted in the software unable to adequately detect & segment volumes into tissue classes (i.e., grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid). In addition, 59 adolescents exhibited high movements (exceeding 3\u00a0mm) leaving a remaining sample of 1416 participants. Finally, given that the CBCL measures children and adolescent psychopathologies (<18\u00a0years old), 56 adults subjects were excluded, leaving a final sample size of 1360 adolescents. \n\n\n### Cortico-cortical and Amygdalo-cortical functional connectivity \n  \nTo examine the cortico-cortical connectivity, we extracted functional connectivity between cortical parcels derived from the Gordon\u2019s parcellation (i.e., 333 cortical parcels) covering the whole cortex ( ), as used in the ABCD study ( ). These 333 cortical parcels are grouped into 13 intrinsic networks, namely Auditory, Cingulo-Opercular, Cingulo-Parietal, Default Mode Network, Ventral and Dorsal Attention, Frontoparietal, Somatomotor (Hand), Somatomotor (Mouth), Retrosplenial-Temporal, Salience, Visual, and Unassigned (None). We additionally included left and right amygdala from the FSL Harvard-Oxford Atlas, provided in the CONN Toolbox. Physiological noise, realignment parameters, and movement artifacts were regressed out as confounding effects from the BOLD time-series for each parcel. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \n#### Mass-Univariate analysis \n  \nIn the first-level analysis, Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between the residual BOLD time course from each parcel and the time course of all other 332 parcels, for each subject. The same was done for amygdala regions and all Gordon 333 parcels. Coefficients were converted to normally distributed z-scores using a Fisher Z-Transformation. Second-level analyses were conducted using mass-univariate linear regression to examine relationships with CP derived from the CBCL and the SDQ, removing the effect of age, sites, sex, percentage of valid scans and framewise displacement. To identify brain connectivity that were reliably associated with CP, we conducted mass-univariate linear regression analyses on 5,000 random subsamples using 90\u00a0% of the total sample at each iteration. Brain connectivity were then considered as statistically associated with CP if the average p-value across the 5,000 iterations met the uncorrected threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.005. This somewhat liberal threshold was used to keep brain connectivity that has acceptable association with CP. After having selected the most correlated brain connectivity across CBCL and the SDQ (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005), we kept only those overlapping between the two scales which may characterize the core features underpinning. These steps were conducted to adequately control for type II errors (i.e., false negative due to stringent thresholding) as well as decreasing type I errors by limiting spurious and scale-specific results. Indeed, selecting the most stable brain connectivity measures across the 5,000 subsampling iterations and those overlapping between scales measuring the same construct may reduce the risk for falsely accepting the null hypothesis on spurious brain connectivity. \n\n\n#### Permutation feature importance \n  \nAfter having identified brain connectivity associated with CP across scales, we investigated whether brain connectivity results differed between scales regarding their importance in explaining variance of the CBCL and SDQ. We calculated feature importance by conducting a multivariate linear regression which included the resulting brain connectivity measures (independent variables) in association with CP severity (dependent variable), respectively. We permutated each brain connectivity measure 100 times on a test set (20\u00a0% of the data) and compared R  scores between the baseline model on the train set (80\u00a0% of the data without permutations). Given that results may vary depending on the selected test set, we ran permutation importance on 1,000 randomly selected test set and averaged estimates. Compared to the base model, changes in R  score would therefore indicate the relative importance of a particular feature. Finally, we examined differences in feature importance of each brain connectivity between the CBCL and SDQ with Fisher r-to-z transformation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, two-tailed). Subanalyses were performed using the same statiscal procedure to examine whether results may have been driven by developmental period (i.e., childhood, adolescence) and scanner strength (i.e., 3 Tesla, 1.5 Tesla). \n\n\n\n### Exploratory analyses \n  \nAs exploratory analyses, we sought to examine whether the brain connectivity associated with severity of CP were also related to other psychopathologies, namely irritability, ADHD symptoms and callous-unemotional traits. To do so, we conducted partial correlations between brain connectivity and psychopathologies, adjusting for the effect of age, sites, sex, percentage of valid scans and framewise displacement. \n\n\n### Functional decoding \n  \nFunctional decoding was conducted to examine the neurocognitive domains (i.e., task fMRI) underlying functional connectivity between two ROIs that are associated with CP, using the BrainMap environment. The BrainMap environment include a repository of neuroimaging studies which contain brain coordinates and metadata (e.g., sample size, behavioral categories) for more than 21,083 experiments. Brain coordinates (foci) and metadata (e.g., behavioral categories, sample size, contrasts) of papers included in the repository are coded by their research team, as well as authors of original papers via Scribe ( ) and then verified by BrainMap staff. BrainMap ontology rely on 60 behavioral categories grouped into 5 domains: cognition, emotion, perception, action, interoception. The Behavioral Analysis plugin for Multi-image Analysis GUI ( ) ( ) relies on the binomial \u201csuccess\u201d probabilities of activation foci within a ROI than expected for random spatial distribution for a behavioral subdomain. Z-score of 3.0 or more represent p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. \n\nIn the current study, 49 categories from 4 different neurocognitive domains were included (i.e., Action, Emotion, Cognition, Perception) given that none of the parcel was significantly associated with Interoception subcategories. Then, each parcel of a given brain connectivity (parcel A & parcel B) was characterized by a binary set of 49 behavioral categories (0 [Z\u00a0<\u00a03] and 1 [Z\u00a0\u2265\u00a03]). We created an adjacency matrix (49 categories-by-49 categories) representing the connected categories between parcel A and parcel B. Then, we summed adjacency matrices for all brain connectivity measure significantly associated with CP, separately for positive and negative correlations. Finally, behavioral categories at a node-level were ranked based on their number of edges (degree centrality) and influence across the network (betweenness centrality). We also examined what behavioral domains were the most frequently reported across brain connectivity. These analyses were conducted with python\u2019s NetworkX package ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Cortico-cortical and Amygdalo-cortical functional connectivity \n  \nMass univariate analysis revealed significant functional brain connectivity associated with CP-CBCL (231 connections at a p\u00a0<\u00a00.005 uncorrected threshold) and CP-SDQ (269 connections at a p\u00a0<\u00a00.005 uncorrected threshold). From these results, only 21 brain connections were shared across both scales (i.e., 10 positively and 11 negatively associated with CP, see  A-C and  ). Overall, brain connectivity measures of CP were mainly driven by nodes of the Somatomotor (6 out of 21 connections) and Ventral Attention networks (4 out of 10 positive connections), but also with unassigned parcels from the Gordon Atlas (None: 4 connections). More precisely, severity of CP was positively associated with functional connectivity within-Somatomotor (2 connections), between Frontoparietal and unassigned parcels (i.e., bilateral posterior hippocampus \u2013 Frontal Eye Fields) but also between Ventral Attention and Default Mode Network, Dorsal Attention, Frontoparietal and Somatomotor. Furthermore, CP was negatively associated with functional connectivity between cingulo-opercular & visual (2 connections), Somatomotor & Salience network (2 connectivitiy between precentral & dACC), auditory & cingulo-opercular & Default Mode Network as well as within-Default Mode Network.   \nAssociations between cortico-cortical connectivity and Conduct Problems across different scales.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) \n  \n\nWhen examining feature importance of the 21 connections in a multivariate linear regression, we observed that between CBCL and SDQ, brain connectivity measures had roughly similar importance (see  ), except for P5 (CBCL\u00a0>\u00a0SDQ), N8 (SDQ\u00a0>\u00a0CBCL) and N11 (CBCL\u00a0>\u00a0SDQ). The top 5 most important features were (please refer to  ): 1)   P8 connection  : Premotor-Lateral OFC (R  change 0.016-0.018); 2)   N6 connection  : Lateral OFC-SMA (R  change 0.016-0.020); 3)   P9 connection:   Precentral-dlPFC (R  change 0.014-0.020); 4)   P2 connection:   Lateral PFC-vlPFC (R  change 0.011-0.018) and 5)   N4 connection  : dmPFC-Lateral PFC (R  change 0.014-0.016). The least important feature was N8 connection: dACC-Postcentral (R  change 0-0.001).   \nMultivariate Feature Importance (resting-state brain connectivity) associated with Conduct Problems across assessments tools. \n  \n\nRegarding amygdalo-cortical functional brain connectivity, analyses revealed that the CP-CBCL was negatively associated with functional connectivity between the right amygdala and the left (F\u00a0=\u00a010.38, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and right (F\u00a0=\u00a09.16, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) ventral PCC (BA 23). Additionally, the CP-SDQ only showed negative association between the right amygdala and the pMTG (FP) (F\u00a0=\u00a012.57, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected). Thus, no significant connectivity intersected between the two scales, which suggest low reliability in amygdala connectivity across CP scales. \n\n\n### Testing for effects of developmental stage and scanning sites \n  \nTesting for differences in features importance across developmental periods yielded significant differences when examining the features\u2019 relationships with CP-CBCL. Indeed, importance of N2 (aINS-Lingual, Z\u00a0=\u00a04.44) and N3 (SMA-Heschl, Z\u00a0=\u00a02.4) significantly increased in adolescence, whereas importance of P3 (pHipp-FEF, Z\u00a0=\u00a03.13), P10 (AG-PCUN, Z\u00a0=\u00a02.6), N4 (dmPFC-lPFC, Z\u00a0=\u00a02.45), N5 (lOFC-ITG, Z\u00a0=\u00a03.64), and N10 (PoCg-pgACC, Z\u00a0=\u00a03.1) decreased in adolescence. However, when examining feature importance between developmental stages using the CP-SDQ, no significant differences were observed (see   for complete results). \n\nMoreover, when comparing features importance between scanner strengths (i.e., 3-tesla versus 1.5-tesla), importance of N4 (dmPFC-lPFC) and N6 (lOFC-SMA) were significantly stronger in the 3\u00a0T subsample for both CBCL and SDQ. Also, P4 (pHipp-FEF), N1 (pINS-dmPFC) and N9 (PrCG-pMTG) showed stronger importance in the 3\u00a0T subsample compared to the 1.5\u00a0T subsample when using the CP-CBCL, whereas N10 (PoCG-pgACC) showed stronger importance in the 1.5\u00a0T compared to the 3\u00a0T when using the CP-SDQ (see  ). \n\n\n### Exploratory analyses \n  \nPartial correlations revealed that irritability, ADHD symptoms, callousness, uncaring but not unemotional traits were associated with brain connectivity (see   &  ). Indeed, irritability showed strong associations with N7 (dACC-PoCG,   r  \u00a0=\u00a0-0.107), P9 (PrCG-dlPFC,   r  \u00a0=\u00a00.094), and P5 (PoCG-PrCG,   r  \u00a0=\u00a00.092). Top brain connectivity measures associated with ADHD symptoms were N11 (V2-lPFC,   r  \u00a0=\u00a0-0.081), N6 (lOFC-SMA,   r  \u00a0=\u00a0-0.08), and P3 (pHipp-FEF,   r  \u00a0=\u00a00.08).   \nRelationship between functional brain connectivity associated with Conduct Problems and other psychopathologies. Please refer to   for complete list of brain connectivity measure. Red lines\u00a0=\u00a0Positive associations with conduct problems; Blue lines\u00a0=\u00a0Negative associations with conduct problems. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) \n    \nRelationship between resting-state brain connectivity associated with Conduct Problems and other psychopathologies. \n  \n\nRegarding CU traits, severity of uncaring traits was mainly associated with N10 (PoCG-pgACC,   r  \u00a0=\u00a0-0.127), P4 (pHipp-FEF,   r  \u00a0=\u00a00.114), and P10 (AG-PCUN,   r  \u00a0=\u00a00.096), whereas callousness show stronger correlation with N9 (PrCG-pMTG,   r  \u00a0=\u00a0-0.098), N10 (PoCG,   r  \u00a0=\u00a0-0.095), and N4 (dmPFC-lPFC,   r  \u00a0=\u00a0-0.09). \n\n\n### Functional decoding \n  \nAs shown in  , the functional brain connectivity measures associated with CP were characterized by a variety of behavioral categories. First, positive brain connectivity measures were mainly related to interaction between Action and Cognition as well as within-Cognition domains. Indeed, the most frequent connection of behavioral domains was between Speech Execution (Action) and Working Memory (Cognition) with 4 out of 11 pairs of parcels. Also, the top 5 categories with the largest number of connections (node centrality) included: Unspecified (Action), Speech Execution (Action), Working Memory (Cognition), Attention (Cognition) and Semantics (Cognition). The top 5 categories that had the most influence (betweenness centrality) on the network were: Working Memory (Cognition), Unspecified (Action), Speech Execution (Action), Explicit Memory (Cognition) and Semantics (Cognition).   \nCircular layout displaying the relationship between the behavioral domains significantly associated with functional brain connectivity. Red graph\u00a0=\u00a0brain connectivity positively related to CP. Blue Graph\u00a0=\u00a0brain connectivity negatively related to CP. Thicker line represents larger number of connected behavioral categories across pairs of brain connectivity. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) \n  \n\nSecond, negative brain connectivity measures rather showed a widespread relationship between the four behavioral domains. Indeed, the most frequent connections were 1) Action Execution (Unspecified) & Reward, 2) Attention & Reward, 3) Attention & Somesthesis (Unspecified), and 4) Reward & Somesthesis (Unspecified) with each 3 out of 10 pairs of parcels ( ). Moreover, the top 5 categories with the largest number of connections (node centrality) were: Orthography (Cognition), Shape (Visual), Unspecified (Visual), Speech Execution (Action) and Attention (Cognition). Finally, the top 5 categories that had the most influence on the network were: Orthography (Cognition), Shape (Visual), Unspecified (Visual), Speech Execution (Action) but also Reward (Emotions). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nUsing a large sample of adolescents, we aimed to clarify the role of cortico-cortical and amygdalo-cortical functional brain connectivity associated with CP. More precisely, we investigated the reliability of the relationship between resting-state brain connectivity measures and severity CP using two different psychometric scales (CBCL and SDQ). We observed that both scales show distinctive association with brain connectivity measures. Indeed, using a liberal statistical threshold (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005 uncorrected), only 21 cortico-cortical resting-state connectivity measures associated with CP significantly overlapped between the two scales. These mainly included regions involved in the Somatomotor, Ventral Attention and Frontoparietal networks (positive associations) as well as Cingulo-Opercular, Salience and Default Mode Network regions (negative associations). Additional analyses revealed that these regions were characterized by interactions between Action & Cognition (i.e., Positive association with CP) as well as between Reward and Cognition, Perception and Action (i.e., Negative associations with CP). Finally, exploratory analyses revealed most brain connectivity were also associated with other psychopathologies such as irritability, ADHD symptoms, callousness, uncaring but not unemotional traits. \n\nIn our recent   meta  -analysis of resting-state connectivity studies, we showed that antisocial subjects exhibited hyperconnectivity with ventral attention network (ie., aMCC/pre-SMA) and amygdala, and hypoconnectivity regions of the Default Mode Network (i.e., mPFC and PCC/Precuneus) and Dorsal attention network (i.e., PMC, SPL), compared to healthy controls ( ). In line with these results, we found that CP was positively associated with 4 brain connectivity including regions of the ventral attention network and negatively associated with 2 brain connectivity that involved parcels of the Default Mode Network. However, contrasting with results from the   meta  -analysis, we found that CP was rather prominently associated with disrupted connectivity from the Somatomotor network (7 connections), from brain regions unassigned to any of the Gordon Networks such as posterior hippocampus and inferior/middle temporal gyri (6 connections), Frontoparietal (3 connections) as well as cingulo-opercular networks (3 connections). Moreover, we found no reliable evidence of amygdala-cortical connectivity across scales. It is noteworthy to mention that studies included in our prior   meta  -analysis restricted their analyses on   a priori   seeds and did not investigate the whole connectome, and this may largely explain the discrepancies between results. Second, the functional connectivity alterations associated with CP may differ between a case-control design versus a study examining severity of CP, dimensionally. In our recent   meta  -analysis using case-control analysis, we found that antisocial population was characterized by disrupted socio-affective and attentional processes ( ). Here, we rather found that CP was dimensionally related to somatomotor and ventral attention, salience and cingulo-opercular networks. While the results of the former   meta  -analysis may help understanding the shared features across subjects, the results of the latter may represent brain connectivity associated with severity of the pathology. \n\nIn the current study, we also investigated whether our results may have been driven by distinct developmental periods. Subanalyses revealed that importance of most brain connectivity associated with CP were relatively robust across developmental periods (i.e., childhood and adolescence). Indeed, the top 5 brain connectivity that were the most strongly associated with CP (i.e.,   P8)   Primary Motor Cortex (Somatomotor) - Lateral OFC (Ventral Attention);   N6)   Lateral OFC (None) - SMA (Cingulo-opercular); P9) Precentral (Somatomotor) \u2013 dlPFC (Dorsal Attention);   P2)   Lateral PFC (Frontoparietal) - vlPFC (Ventral Attention); and   N4)   dmPFC (Default Mode Network) - lateral PFC (Default Mode Network)) show no significant change across developmental stages (except   N4   using the CBCL). However, subtle differences between developmental periods were only observed using the CBCL. Although these intriguing results are difficult to interpret and further research is needed, it is possible that the CBCL-CP may capture the heterogeneity of CP (i.e., aggression and rule-breaking behaviors), and thus allows variations in item endorsement rates depending on the time period (i.e., childhood versus adolescence), while the SDQ don\u2019t. For instance, contrasting to the longitudinal measurement invariance of the broad SDQ-CP items ( ), adolescents (Mean\u00a0=\u00a03.18) may be more likely than children (Mean\u00a0=\u00a02.8) to endorse CBCL items underpinning rule-breaking behaviors (e.g., runaway, sets fire, steals, truancy, vandalism). It is thus possible that these variations in the endorsement of items may alter the relationship between some brain connectivity and CP. It is unequivocal that further research is needed to adequately address this. \n\nInterestingly, we provided evidence that brain connectivity measures that were positively associated with CP were mainly characterized by interaction between Action Execution & Cognition behavioral domains. First, brain connectivity measures that were positively associated with CP included lateral PFC regions (i.e., ventro and dorsolateral) and the postcentral/precentral gyri. According to a recent   meta  -analysis, both the lateral PFC and precentral gyrus co-activate during   n  -back working memory tasks ( ). Indeed, it has been shown that the lateral PFC (ventral and dorsal parts) plays a major role in the reception, maintenance and monitoring of sensory inputs and sending outputs to the motor system ( ,  ), whereas the precentral gyrus may rather be involved in action preparation and the processing of motor movements ( ). As such, these results are in line with a recent   meta  -analysis of task-based fMRI studies showing that antisocial subjects exhibit aberrant co-activation of these particular brain regions (i.e., precentral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) during cognitive control tasks ( ). Interestingly, past results suggest that from 10 to 26\u00a0years old, changes in functional connectivity of the somatomotor and cingulo-opercular/salience networks may reflect development of cognitive control ( ,  ). More precisely, deficient activity and connectivity of the somatomotor network might be a transdiagnostic neurobiological marker of general psychopathology in children and adolescent ( ,  ) as well as in adults ( ). While some have found that deficient activity in somatomotor regions may confer an increased risk for general externalizing behavior ( ), others showed that a latent component of resting-state connectivity, mostly characterized by positive connectivity within the somatomotor network and between the somatomotor and VentAttn/Salience, was strongly associated with impulsivity features (e.g., functional impulsivity, novelty seeking, motor impulsivity, persistence, impulsiveness) ( ). Given these results, it could be hypothesized that the connectivity of somatomotor network may be a neurobiological substrate of motor impulsiveness. Indeed, motor impulsiveness is prominently correlated with early criminality ( ), higher risk for CD and ASPD ( ,  ), a greater severity of crime ( ), especially proactive and reactive aggression ( ,  ,  ,  ). Concurring with the idea that motor impulsiveness may be transdiagnostic (or co-occurring feature), we found that brain connectivity of somatomotor regions, both within- and between-network, were also associated with irritability, ADHD symptoms and callousness. Even though it may represent a transdiagnostic neurobiological marker, future studies should seek to investigate the specific role of somatomotor network in the development of antisocial behaviors. \n\nSecond, brain connectivity measures that were negatively associated with CP mainly included the pg- & dACC, the SMA and the aINS and lateral PFC, which were mainly represented by interactions between Reward and Action Execution, Attention & Somesthesis. These brain regions are involved in the ventral attention, salience and cingulo-opercular networks ( ). Although they are systematically observed across   meta  -analyses on reward tasks ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ), the ACC and aINS are not specific to any particular neurocognitive domain ( ,  ), are known to be generally involved in detecting behaviorally relevant stimuli in the environment ( ), and may play an interacting role between internally (i.e., DMN) and externally directed actions (i.e., frontoparietal network) ( ). In contrast with the functional decoding suggesting their implications in reward processing tasks, we recently found that antisocial subjects exhibited reduced brain activity in these regions (i.e., pg- & dACC extending to the aMCC/pre-SMA as well as the aINS) during acute threat response ( ). Moreover, recent studies support the association of functional brain dysconnectivity at a region-level (i.e., aINS-pgACC & pgACC-Supramarginal Gyrus, see  ) and a network-level (i.e., increased salience-ventral attention connectivity, see  ) with broad externalizing problems. In our study, we observed that CP was negatively associated with functional connectivity of brain regions underpinning Cingulo-Opercular network (i.e., aINS, lPFC, SMA) and those corresponding to visual (i.e., Area 2 and lingual gyrus), Auditory (i.e., Heschl gyrus) and unlabeled (i.e., Lateral OFC). Furthermore, we found that CP was positively associated with functional connectivity between nodes of VentAttn and those from FP, DorsAttn and SomMot. Although we found no evidence of dysconnectivity between the core regions of the Salience, VentAttn and Cingulo-Opercular networks, namely the dACC, aMCC/pre-SMA, vlPFC and aINS, we nonetheless found that most pairs of brain connectivity which included one of these regions also correlated with severity of irritability and ADHD symptoms. These findings suggest a potential role of these regions in externalizing pathology. Indeed, brain connectivity which included regions of the Cingulo-Opercular network also correlated with ADHD symptoms (  r   ranging from \u22120.056 to \u22120.081) and irritability symptoms (  r   ranging from \u22120.033 to \u22120.082), whereas those involving regions of the VentAttn were rather associated with irritability (  r   ranging from 0.042 to 0.084) compared to ADHD symptoms (  r   ranging from 0.025 to 0.076). More importantly, we also found that reduced connectivity between the dACC (Salience) and the postcentral gyrus (Somatomotor) network were specifically associated with irritability but not the other psychopathologies. These results somewhat converge with recent findings showing that a latent component of resting-state connectivity, mainly characterized by altered connectivity within of the somatomotor network and between the somatomotor and salience/ventral attention networks, was strongly associated with features underpinning neuroticism (i.e., mood lability, dysfunctional impulsivity, anxiety) ( ). Of interest for the symptoms of irritability, activity of the dACC is frequently thought to be a core brain region during frustrative non-reward ( ,  ,  ), whereas activity of the postcentral gyrus is observed when initiating aggressive and retaliatory behaviors ( ,  ). It could be hypothesized that a weaker dACC-postcentral gyrus connectivity may increase the proneneness for CP (i.e., aggressive behaviors) by disinhibiting action initiation processes. It is unequivocal that future studies should seek to investigate this relationship more specifically. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nIn our study, we aimed to address several limitations of current literature on resting-state functional connectivity such as the usually low sample size and the variability in the psychometric scales used across studies. Despite the strengths of our study, few limitations need to be acknowledged. Indeed, the sample contains a relatively wide age range spanning from childhood to late adolescence. This could have introduced biases in our results. However, we took additional measures to minimize the effects of age and conducted subanalyses that examined the effect of age on the reliability of our results. Indeed, developmental period only altered a few results, and these were only reported for CBCL, whereas the SDQ showed no significant differences. Secondly, neuroimaging data was collected in 3 different sites (two with identical scanning parameter) that may have altered results. We also tested whether differences in scanner strengths may have altered our results. We found that importance of some brain connectivity was significantly stronger when using 3\u00a0T scanner compared to 1.5\u00a0T. Third, the proximity of Gordon\u2019s parcels and the amygdala (Harvard Oxford Atlas) may have caused autocorrelation issues which could explain lack of significant relationship between CP and functional connectivity between the amygdala and other structures such as the anterior medial temporal lobe. Fourth, the HBN adopted a community-referred recruitment model. Therefore, careful interpretations should be made when comparing study results with population-based cohorts. Although the sample size was relatively large in our study, further examination with other samples is needed to validate the generalizability of our results. \n\nConclusions. \n\nIn conclusion, we found that brain connectivity associated with CP largely depends on the measure used. In fact, only 21 connections were shared between the CBCL and SDQ even if both scales show relatively strong phenotypic correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.79). Nonetheless, these 21 connections mainly spanned the SomMot, VentAttn and FP (positive) and Cingulo-Opercular, Salience and DMN (negative) networks. Results of this study indicate that severity CP may principally be associated brain connectivity underpinning cognitive and motor control (positive) and emotional inhibition (negative association). Finally, the brain connectivity associated with CP were also related to other psychopathologies, suggesting that irritability, ADHD symptoms, callousness and uncaring may play a central role in neural features underpinning CP. This concurs with recent research showing that from 6 to 12\u00a0years old, the developmental co-occurrence of irritability, hyperactivity and CU traits plays an additive role in the risk for CP ( ). Future research should seek to investigate the replicability of our findings in different samples. \n\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement \n  \n Jules R.
