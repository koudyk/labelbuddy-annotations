Although reality monitoring seems to overlap with the concept of self-monitoring, which allows one to distinguish self-generated actions or thoughts from those generated by others, the two concepts remain largely separate cognitive domains and their common brain substrates have received little attention. We investigated the brain regions involved in these two cognitive processes and explored the common brain regions they share. To do this, we conducted two separate coordinate-based meta-analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies assessing the brain regions involved in reality- and self-monitoring. Few brain regions survived threshold-free cluster enhancement family-wise multiple comparison correction (p\u2009<\u2009.05), likely owing to the small number of studies identified. Using uncorrected statistical thresholds recommended by Signed Differential Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images, the meta-analysis of reality-monitoring studies (k\u2009=\u20099 studies including 172 healthy subjects) revealed clusters in the lobule VI of the cerebellum, the right anterior medial prefrontal cortex and anterior thalamic projections. The meta-analysis of self-monitoring studies (k\u2009=\u200912 studies including 192 healthy subjects) highlighted the involvement of a set of brain regions including the lobule VI of the left cerebellum and fronto-temporo-parietal regions. We showed with a conjunction analysis that the lobule VI of the cerebellum was consistently engaged in both reality- and self-monitoring. The current findings offer new insights into the common brain regions underlying reality-monitoring and self-monitoring, and suggest that the neural signature of the self that may occur during self-production should persist in memories. \n", "metadata": {"pmid": "37246722", "journal": "Human brain mapping", "publication_year": "2023", "title": "The neural signature of reality-monitoring: A meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies.", "keywords": "coordinate-based meta-analysis \nfMRI \nreality-monitoring \nself-monitoring \n", "abstract": "Distinguishing imagination and thoughts from information we perceived from the environment, a process called reality-monitoring, is important in everyday situations.
