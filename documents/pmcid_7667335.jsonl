Then, we used MRI analyses and found that putamina atrophy and hyperintensive rim (T WI) were characteristic features in MSA\u2010P and cerebellar atrophy, the \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign and signal rise in the middle cerebellar peduncle were more obvious in MSA\u2010C. To further explore the distinctions among the 3 diseases, we also used 18F\u2010FDG\u2010PET technology for our examination and found a decrease in glucose metabolism in the parietal area for Parkinson's Disease (PD), in the bilateral putamen for MSA\u2010P, and in the bilateral cerebellum for MSA\u2010C. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis study identified the distinctive features of the clinic symptoms, MRI irregularity, and glucose metabolism on  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET, which provided a new basis for the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD), MSA with predominant Parkinsonism (MSA\u2010P), and MSA with predominant cerebellar features (MSA\u2010C). \n\n  \nThis study identified the distinctive features of the clinic symptoms, MRI irregularity, and glucose metabolism on  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET, which provided a new basis for the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD), MSA with predominant Parkinsonism (MSA\u2010P), and MSA with predominant cerebellar features (MSA\u2010C).\n   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nParkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by certain clinical features, such as bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor, and is associated with progressive neuronal loss in substantia nigra and other brain regions. The diagnosis of PD can be straightforward in patients with typical clinical presentation of cardinal signs, but misdiagnosis of PD is not uncommon. In a clinical\u2010pathological study, the accuracy of a clinical diagnosis of PD is not high, with only 76% of postmortem confirmed cases being diagnosed correctly (Rajput, Rozdilsky, & Rajput,\u00a0 ). The most common misdiagnoses are related to Atypical Parkinson's disease (APD) such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration (Horvath, Burkhard, Bouras, & K\u00f6vari\u00a0 ; Levin, Kurz, Arzberger, Giese, & H\u00f6glinger\u00a0 ). Since prognosis and treatment options of PD and APD are substantially different, differential diagnosis of PD from APD is critical for clinicians. \n\nMultiple system atrophy (MSA), one of the most common APD, is an adult\u2010onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by a combination of parkinsonism, autonomic disorder, and cerebellar ataxia (Coon et al.,\u00a0 ). Based on the predominant symptoms of the disease, MSA is categorized into two forms of MSA: MSA with predominant Parkinsonism (MSA\u2010P) and MSA with predominant cerebellar features (MSA\u2010C) (Gilman et al.,\u00a0 ). The differential diagnosis of MSA from PD can be challenging since MSA shares some clinical features with PD, especially at the early stage of the disease (McKay & Cheshire,\u00a0 ). In addition, some features, which can differentiate MSA from PD, such as poor responsiveness to levodopa, autonomic dysfunction, and cerebellar incoordination, may take several years to occur (Bhatia, Stamelou, Fanciulli, & Wenning,\u00a0 ). Therefore, it is difficult to differentiate these disease using clinical criteria alone, and efforts have been made to improve the accuracy of the differential diagnosis with imaging methods. \n\nMany imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have been used to differentiate PD from MSA and other atypical Parkinsonism (Kwon, Choi, Kim, Lee, & Chung,\u00a0 ,  ; Meyer, Frings, R\u00fccker, & Hellwig\u00a0 ; Walker et al.,\u00a0 ). The differential diagnosis can be assisted by the characteristic features of MSA revealed by MRI, such as atrophy of the brainstem and cerebellum, and putaminal hyperintensive rim and \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign (Hughes, Daniel, Ben\u2010Shlomo, & Lees,\u00a0 ; Poewe & Wenning,\u00a0 ). However, it remains unclear whether these MRI findings are valid for differentiation of MSA from PD. In addition, the MRI findings for differentiation between MSA\u2010P and MSA\u2010C have not well studied. \n\nMulti\u2010tracer PET including  F\u2010dopamine PET, dopamine transporter PET, dopamine receptor PET, and tau PET increasingly used for diagnosis and differentiation of PD and APD. However, an overlap between PD and MSA in these PET images limits their usefulness in the differential diagnosis (Koga, Ono, Sahara, Higuchi, & Dickson,  ; Niccolini & Politis,\u00a0 ). Metabolic brain imaging by  F\u2010fluorodeoxyglucose ( F\u2010FDG) PET has showed characteristic reduction in glucose metabolism in the lentiform nucleus and cerebellum in MSA patients (Eckert & Eidelberg,\u00a0 ; Meyer et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), which can differentiate MSA patients from PD patients, especially at the early disease stages when no characteristic features occur on MRI. However, the patterns of glucose metabolism on  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET in PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C patients have not been well established yet. \n\nIn this study, we aimed to characterize the differences in clinical features, MRI abnormality, and glucose metabolism on  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET for differential diagnosis among PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C. \n\n\n## SUBJECTS AND METHODS \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nThis study included 30 PD patients (16 males and 14 females), 22 MSA\u2010P patients and 28 MSA\u2010C patients, and 44 age\u2010matched healthy controls. All these patients underwent head MRI, among them 20 PD patients (14 males, age 62.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.7\u00a0years), 11 MSA\u2010P patients (5 males, age 67.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1\u00a0years), and 13 MSA\u2010C patients (6 males, age 59.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.7\u00a0years) underwent both MRI and  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET examinations. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Tianjin Medical University, and all subjects gave their informed consent. The PD patients were diagnosed according to MDS clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease (Postuma et al.,\u00a0 ), and MSA patients were diagnosed according to the Second consensus statement on the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy by Gilman et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ). The clinical data were listed in Table\u00a0 . Patients with drug\u2010induced Parkinsonism, vascular Parkinsonism, supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and dementia with Lewy bodies were excluded. Patients were evaluated by the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) part I, II and III, and Hoehn\u2010Yahr stage. \n  \nClinical characteristics of PD patients, MSA\u2010P patients, MSA\u2010C patients \n    \n\n### Magnetic resonance imaging \n  \nThe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in all patients using MRI device (GE, USA), and a circular polarized head coil. All patients had axial T1\u2010weighted Fluid\u2010Attenuated Inversion Recovery Sequence (T1FLAIR), T2\u2010weighted images (T2WI), sagittal T1FLAIR, and coronal T2WI. T1FLAIR was performed as follows: repetition time (TR), 2000\u20132100\u00a0ms; inversion time(TI), 750\u00a0ms; and echo time (TE), 10\u201330\u00a0ms. T2WI was performed as follows: TR. 4000\u20135000\u00a0ms; TE, 100\u2013160\u00a0ms. The slice thickness was set at 6\u00a0mm with a interslice gap of 2\u00a0mm. \n\nMRI images were obtained at pons, cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebrum, and were evaluated by two blinded radiologists, focusing on the changes in infratentorial parameters (cerebellar atrophy, signal increase in the middle cerebellar peduncle, and \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign), and supratentorial parameters (signal decrease in the basal ganglia, putaminal hyperintensive rim, and cortical atrophy). \n\n\n### F\u2010FDG\u2010PET imaging \n  \nThe PET scans were performed in a 3\u2010dimensional mode using GE Discovery LS PET/CT system. A computerized tomography image was obtained for attenuation correction. The subjects fasted for at least 6\u00a0hr and had no psychiatric drugs for at least 2\u00a0weeks before the PET scanning procedure. Subjects lied supine in a dark and quiet room for 15\u00a0min and were administered with an intravenous bolus injection of 185\u2013370\u00a0MBq (5\u201310\u00a0mCi/)  F\u2010FDG. After 40\u00a0min of rest, the heads of subjects were held with fixation strips, and  F\u2010FDG scan was obtained. The scanner was aligned parallel to the orbitomeatal line using a laser beam. Series of PET images were acquired using a rotating position emission detector. Three\u2010dimensional data acquisition mode was performed, and cross\u2010sectional, coronal, and sagittal images were collected with slice thickness of 2\u00a0mm collected in 128\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0128 matrix. \n\nThe  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET results were evaluated by two nuclear medicine physicians blinded to the clinical diagnosis of the patients. Changes of  F\u2010FDG metabolism in regions of interest, including cerebrum, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, lenticular nucleus, and thalamus, were analyzed using visual inspection and SPM methods. For SPM methods, the data were converted from DICOM file into Analyze 7 format. Then, the images were spatially transformed and analyzed with SPM2 running on MATLAB. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nAnalyses were performed using SPSS 22. All values were presented as mean and standard deviation. Student   t   test was used to compare the difference between PD patients and MSA patients. Categorical data were compared with chi square. Probability values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Clinical characteristics \u2010tremor, bradykinesia, cerebellar ataxic gait \n  \nFirst of all, in terms of clinical characteristics, the clinical data of 30 PD patients, 22 MSA\u2010P patients, and 28 MSA\u2010C patients are shown in Table\u00a0 . Patient age, gender, and disease duration did not differ significantly among the three groups. However, we found that significant difference between the PD group and the MSA group (MSA\u2010P and MSA\u2010C) in disease severity (UPDRS motor score, MSA\u2010P 26.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.60 MSA\u2010C 24.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.06 versus PD 17.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.98;   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05, and H\u2010Y stage, MSA\u2010P 2.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.63 MSA\u2010C 2.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.60 versus PD 1.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.72;   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05). \n\nWe further identified the clinical symptoms and signs for differentiating these diseases. Tremor or bradykinesia was the initial feature in all PD patients and the majority (86.4%) of MSA\u2010P patients, but in only one (3.6%) of 28 MSA\u2010C patients. Though tremor predominated in PD patients, bradykinesia occurred more frequently in MSA\u2010P (Table\u00a0 ). In contrast, the majority (53.6%) of MSA\u2010C patients presented an initial symptom of postural instability, which did not occur in PD and MSA\u2010C patients (Table\u00a0 ). At least one of the motor symptoms including tremor at rest, postural tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability developed at latest follow\u2010up in all the PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C patients (Table\u00a0 ). Compared with the PD group, tremor at rest occurred less frequently, and postural instability was more frequently in MSA\u2010P and MSA\u2010C group (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.003). Parkinsonism symptoms such as tremor at rest, rigidity, and bradykinesia were less common in MSA\u2010C patients than those in PD patients (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05). There was no significant difference in rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural tremor between PD group and MSA\u2010P group. In addition, other symptoms were present in MSA group, but not in PD group. Fall and Pisa sign occurred in 2 (9.09%) of 22 MSA\u2010P patients, and cerebellar ataxic gait, limb ataxia, and dysarthria were present in 25 (89.3%), 24 (85.7%), and 8 (28.6%) of 28 MSA\u2010C patients, respectively. \n  \nSymptoms and signs at onset of the patients \n      \nThe Parkinson's symptoms in the PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C groups \n    \nCompared with PD patients, parkinsonian signs in MSA patients were more frequently symmetric. Only 24% of MSA patients had a good response to levodopa (375\u2013750\u00a0mg/day) and the response did not last for more than one year. In addition, autonomic dysfunction was present in 80% of MSA patients, but was in only 13.3% of PD patients (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05). Dementia occurred in 6% of MSA patients. \n\n\n### MRI findings\u2010Cerebellum, basal ganglia \n  \nThen, we used MRI to do research and found that MRI images showed different signal change among PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C groups in infratentorial parameters (cerebellar atrophy, signal increase in the middle cerebellar peduncle, and \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign), and supratentorial parameters (signal decrease in the basal ganglia, putaminal hyperintensive rim, and cortical atrophy) (Table\u00a0 ). Putaminal hyperintensive rim was significantly prominent in the MSA\u2010P group, compared with the PD group and the MSA\u2010C group (Figure\u00a0 ). There was no significant difference in other parameters between PD and MSA\u2010P groups. Infratentorial parameters were more common in MSA\u2010C groups than those in PD and MSA\u2010P groups (Figure\u00a0 ). Among the infratentorial parameters, cerebellar atrophy was most frequently found in the MSA\u2010C patients. However, signal decrease in the basal ganglia and cortical atrophy were not significantly different among these three groups (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nMRI signal change in PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C groups \n      \nMRI images showing bilateral putamen atrophy and putaminal hyperintensive rim in one MSA\u2010P patient \n    \nMRI images showing atrophy in the cerebellum and brainstem, \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign in T WI, enlargement of the fourth ventricle, and mild atrophy in supratentorial structures \n  \n\n### F\u2010FDG\u2010PET imaging \u2010 Cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, Cerebellum \n  \nIn order to further explore the differences among these diseases, we also used 18F\u2010FDG\u2010PET technology to study. In all patients, 20 PD patients (14 males, age 62.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.7\u00a0years), 11 MSA\u2010P patients (5 males, age 67.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1\u00a0years), 13 MSA\u2010C patients (6 males, age 59.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.7\u00a0years), and 44 normal controls (24 males, age 62.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.8\u00a0years) underwent  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET studies. Patient age and gender were not significantly different among the four groups. The disease duration did not differ significantly among PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C groups (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05; PD 30.70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.1\u00a0months, MSA\u2010P 34.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020.1\u00a0months, MSA\u2010C 27.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.5\u00a0months). \n\nFor visual inspection of  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET images, we did not identify a significant different pattern of glucose metabolism between PD group and control group. A clear and symmetrical distribution of the radiotracer was found in the brain areas such as cerebrum, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, lenticular nucleus, and thalamus. A reduction in radiotracer uptake in the basal ganglia and in the cerebellum was found in MSA\u2010P group and MSA\u2010C group, respectively. \n\nWe performed SPM analysis of the group differences in  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET images among the PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C groups. In the PD group, the hallmark of glucose metabolism was a decreased metabolism in parietal areas. 11 (55.0%) of 20 PD patients showed a bilateral reduction in glucose metabolism. Except one patient who showed a reduction in glucose metabolism only in bilateral parietal area, hypometabolic areas in these patients were also observed in parieto\u2010occipital, frontal, occipital, and temporal cortical areas in 3, 3, 2, and 2 PD patients, respectively. 3 patients showed parieto\u2010occipital reduction in glucose metabolism. In addition, 3 PD patients showed different metabolic patterns. One patient had a unilateral reduction in glucose metabolism in frontal lobe, putamen, thalamus, cerebellum, and pons. 2 patients exhibited a decreased metabolism in right putamen and bilateral cerebellum. The glucose metabolism was not significantly different in 3 other PD patients compared with controls (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nF\u2010FDG\u2010PET images in the PD group. Images from SPM analysis showing that in the PD group, glucose metabolism was decreased in bilateral parietal lobe, bilateral frontal lobe, bilateral precuneus, bilateral middle temporal sulcus occipital, and right inferior temporal sulcus and superior occipital sulcus. The hallmark of glucose metabolism is a decreased metabolism in bilateral parietal lobe \n  \nA distinguishing feature of the MSA\u2010P group was the presence of a global hypometabolism in bilateral putamen and caudate. This finding was found in 8 of 11 patients, and 3 of them also had a mild and local reduction in glucose metabolism in bilateral cerebellum. In addition, hypometabolic areas were also observed in bilateral frontal, parietal, occipital, and insular cortical areas (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nF\u2010FDG\u2010PET images in the MSA\u2010P group. Images from SPM analysis showing that in the MSA\u2010P group, glucose metabolism was decreased in bilateral caudate nucleus, bilateral cingulated cortex, left putamen, left inferior parietal lobule and posterior central sulcus, and right superior temporal sulcus and anterior central sulcus. The distinguishing feature of the MSA\u2010P group is the presence of a global hypometabolism in bilateral basal ganglia \n  \nThe glucose metabolism in the MSA\u2010C group is characterized by a marked bilateral reduction in cerebellum. All 13 patients had this distinct characteristics, and 8 (61.5%) of them also showed a hypometabolism in the middle cerebellar peduncle. In addition, hypometabolic areas were also observed in pons and oblongata, frontal area, parietal, and occipital area in 1, 5, and 2 of MSA\u2010C patients, respectively (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nF\u2010FDG\u2010PET images in the MSA\u2010C group. Images from SPM analysis showing that in the MSA\u2010C group, glucose metabolism was decreased in bilateral cerebellum and medulla oblongata, and bilateral parental and frontal lobe. The distinguishing feature of the MSA\u2010C group is the presence of a glucose hypometabolism in bilateral cerebellum \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn this study, we seek to study the PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C, and to find possible discriminating patterns of clinical symptoms, MRI findings, and  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET imaging. We identify several main findings that reflected the difference among PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C. First, clinical data show that the predominant motor symptom was greatly different in that tremor at rest, bradykinesia, and postural instability predominates in PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C patients, respectively. Second, MRI findings indicate that putaminal atrophy and hyperintensive rim (T WI) are characteristic features in MSA\u2010P, and cerebellar atrophy, \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign, and signal increase in the middle cerebellar peduncle are more prominent in MSA\u2010C. Third, the  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET images demonstrate that a reduction in glucose metabolism occurs in parietal area for PD, in bilateral putamen for MSA\u2010P, and in bilateral cerebellum for MSA\u2010C. This study identifies the characteristic features of clinic symptoms, MRI abnormality, and glucose metabolism on  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET, which are indispensable for differential diagnosis among PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C. \n\nThe clinical presentation, MRI findings, and PET images in our study consistently reflect the pathophysiology of these diseases. It is known that the pathology of MSA\u2010P predominates in the basal ganglia, while the pathology of MSA\u2010C predominates in the cerebellum (Ozawa et al.,\u00a0 ). Bradykinesia is a hallmark of basal ganglia disorders and appears to correlate with the degree of dopamine deficiency (Berardelli, Rothwell, Thompson, & Hallett,\u00a0 ; Vingerhoets, Schulzer, Calne, & Snow,\u00a0 ). It has been reported that the decreased uptake of F\u2010fluorodopa is proportional to the degree of bradykinesia (Lozza, Marie, & Baron,  ; Niccolini & Politis,\u00a0 ). Our finding that putaminal hyperintensive rim in MRI and a reduction in glucose metabolism in  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET agree with bradykinesia as the dominant clinical feature in MSA\u2010P group. In contrast, cerebellar signs such as ataxic gait, limb ataxia, and postural instability are more frequently present in MSA\u2010C patients. This clinical feature is supported by the characteristic features on MRI and  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET images showing predominant cerebellar lesions. In addition, at the similar disease duration, MSA\u2010P and MSA\u2010C patients exhibit more severity in motor dysfunction with higher UPDRS and H\u2010Y scores than PD patients, supporting the fact that MSA develops more rapidly than PD (Laurens et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nPutaminal hyperintensive rim in the MRI (T WI) occurs most frequently in MSA\u2010P patients compared with PD and MSA\u2010C patients. However, hyperintensive rim occurs in only 31.8% of MSA\u2010P patients and is also present in 2 (6.7%) of PD patients. The low sensitivity disfavors hyperintensive rim as a useful parameter for distinguishing MSA\u2010P from PD as previously reported (Hughes et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). The specificity of hyperintensive rim in this study is different from a previous report, which demonstrated that hyperintensive rim showed a highest specificity (90%) in MSA\u2010P patients (Hughes et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). This difference may result from different patients with variant clinical features and disease stage as well as different imaging conditions between the two studies. In addition, hyperintensive rim is not present in our MSA\u2010C patients with average disease duration of about 3\u00a0years. It is reported that hyperintensive rim occurs early in MSA\u2010P patient (less than 3\u00a0years) and late in MSA\u2010C patient (more than 4\u00a0years) (Pradhan & Tandon,\u00a0 ). Therefore, the presence of hyperintensive rim on MRI may be a good sign to exclude the diagnosis of MSA\u2010C, especially at the early stage of the disease. \n\nInfratentorial parameters in MRI such as cerebellar atrophy, signal increase in middle cerebellar peduncle, and \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign show a higher specificity in MSA\u2010C patients, and are useful for differentiation of MSA\u2010C from PD and MSA\u2010P patients. \u201cHot cross bun\u201d sign exhibits the highest specificity in MSA\u2010C patients and is not found in MSA\u2010P patients. This result agrees with previous study that \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign was observed later than putaminal hyperintensive rim in MSA\u2010P (Pradhan & Tandon,\u00a0 ). However, signal increase in middle cerebellar peduncle occurs only in 28.6% of MSA\u2010C patients, suggesting that it is not a sensitive parameter for early diagnosis of MSA\u2010C. \n\nIn order to further explore the differences between these diseases, we also used  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET for research which detects the change of regional glucose metabolism has been used for differential diagnose of PD from MSA (Grimaldi et al.,\u00a0 ; Kwon et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Meles, Teune, de Jong, Dierckx, & Leenders,  ; Meyer et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Ping, Benshu, & Shuo,\u00a0 ; Tom\u0161e et al.,\u00a0 ), since glucose metabolism at resting state is an effective marker for density and activity of synapse, which can reflect the neurodegenerative states of parkinsonian diseases. The glucose metabolism is not decreased in the basal ganglia in the majority of our PD patients with average disease duration of <3\u00a0years, suggesting that the basal ganglia are not seriously affected at the early stage of PD. However, glucose hypometabolism was found mainly in the parietal areas in our PD patients with no sign of dementia. This finding agrees with a previous report that the glucose metabolism was decreased in the parietal and parieto\u2010occipital regions in nondemented Parkinson's patients (Albrecht, Ballarini, Neumann, & Schroeter,\u00a0 ). It may be related to the regulation of Nigra striatum dopaminergic pathway in substantia nigra striatum of early Parkinson's disease. In addition, only one patient in MSA\u2010P and MSA\u2010C patients exhibits a hypometablosm in parietal area, suggesting that it is a good parameter for differentiation of PD from MSA. However, since 3 PD patients did not exhibit any difference in glucose metabolism from controls, the absence of glucose hypometabolism cannot exclude the diagnosis of PD. However, clinical diagnosis of PD is confirmed correctly by 76% of postmortem cases (Rajput et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). At present, the diagnosis of early PD is mainly based on clinical symptoms, and there is no specific manifestation of head MRI in the early stage. In this study, 11/20 patients with clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease had bilateral parietal hypometabolism, and another 3/20 patients had hypometabolism in the parieto\u2010occipital syndesmosis area, which was not high, possibly due to the following reasons: (a) In this study, the duration of Parkinson's disease was 42.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.11\u00a0months, which was relatively short. Perhaps, the typical manifestations would gradually appear in patients with Parkinson's disease over time; (b) 3/20 patients had hypometabolism in the occipitoparietal junction area, and the clinical manifestations and FDG\u2010PET manifestations should be dynamically observed to further determine the diagnosis of PD. (c) One patient had a unilateral reduction in glucose metabolism in frontal lobe, putamen, thalamus, cerebellum, and pons. 2 patients exhibited a decreased metabolism in right putamen and bilateral cerebellum. The presence or absence of Parkinson's superimposition in these three patients should be further diagnosed by dynamic observation of PDG\u2010PET changes. (d) The glucose metabolism was not significantly different in 3 other PD patients compared with controls. Whether PDG\u2010PET changes of PD or MSA will occur gradually with the progression of the disease should be followed up. These findings suggest that the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease should be a dynamic process, and perhaps early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease patients will continue to revise the diagnosis as the disease progresses. \n\nOur study also shows that glucose hypometabolism mainly occurs in bilateral putamen for MSA\u2010P patients and in cerebellum for MSA\u2010C patients. This characteristic of PET image is consistent with neuropathologic feature of MSA\u2010P (predominated in basal ganglia) and MSA\u2010C (predominated in cerebellum) (Ozawa et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). The reduction in glucose metabolism in bilateral putamen on PET occurs in 72.7% of MSA\u2010P patients and only in 2 (10.0%) of 20 PD patients, suggesting that it has a good parameter for differential diagnosis of MSA\u2010P and PD. In addition, this finding also suggests that hypometabolism in putamen on PET (72.7%) is more sensitive than the hyperintensive rim in MRI (31.8%) for diagnosis of MSA\u2010P. Furthermore, the hypometabolism in cerebellum shows the highest specificity in diagnosis of MSA\u2010C, since this feature is present in all MSA\u2010C patients, but not in PD patients. Since 3 MSA\u2010P patients also show a reduction in glucose metabolism in cerebellum, suggesting that cerebellar injury may occur very early in certain patients. Some studies suggest that glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) are present in the cortex of MSA patients, especially in the early frontal and parietal lobes (Papp & Lantos,\u00a0 ). Our study found that besides the decrease of subtentorial structural metabolism, there was a decrease of cerebral cortical glucose metabolism in the early stage of MSA. It was also observed that cognitive dysfunction in MSA patients was mainly manifested in poor vocabulary memory and executive function (Burk, Daum, & Rub,\u00a0 ), which was the manifestation of prefrontal lobe damage, consistent with the manifestation of frontal lobe involvement in PET. In this study, the average duration of the disease was less than 3\u00a0years, and further observation of clinical symptoms and the development of PET should be conducted to understand the cortical damage. \n\n### Limitation \n  \nThere are some limitations in this study. For example, the sample size of this study is not very large. Also, the evaluation indicators need to be further expanded to better understand the differential diagnosis among PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nIn summary, we identify the characteristic features of PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C in clinical feature, MRI findings, and PET images. The differences among PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C are consistent with the pathological differences of these diseases, and thus appears to be useful for differential diagnosis among them. In the early stage of the disease, the clinical symptoms and signs are atypical, and the positive rate of MRI imaging is not high, which often brings difficulties to the diagnosis.  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET imaging can find more typical disease signs, which is a better differential diagnosis method. \n\n\n## CONFLICTS OF INTEREST \n  \nAll authors have contributed significantly to the manuscript and declare that the work is original and has not been submitted or published elsewhere.
