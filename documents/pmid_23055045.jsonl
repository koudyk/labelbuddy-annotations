Meanwhile, each DICCCOL landmark is localized in an individual brain's unique morphological profile, and therefore the DICCCOL system offers a universal and individualized brain reference and localization framework. However, in current 358 diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived DICCCOLs, only 95 of them have been functionally annotated via task-based or resting-state fMRI datasets and the functional roles of other DICCCOLs are unknown yet. This work aims to take the advantage of existing literature fMRI studies (1110 publications) reported and aggregated in the BrainMap database to examine the possible functional roles of 358 DICCCOLs via meta-analysis. Our experimental results demonstrate that a majority of 358 DICCCOLs can be functionally annotated by the BrainMap database, and many DICCCOLs have rich and diverse functional roles in multiple behavior domains. This study provides novel insights into the functional regularity and diversity of 358 DICCCOLs, and offers a starting point for future elucidation of fine-grained functional roles of cortical landmarks.
