The default mode network (DMN) as a mental process might influence brand equity related consumers' decision-making, as reported in the marketing literature. While studies on the overlapping regions between the DMN and value-based decision-making related brain regions have been reported in neuroscience literature, relationships between the DMN and a neural mechanism of brand equity have not been clarified. The aim of our study is to identify neural substrates of brand equity and examine brand equity-related mental processes by comparing them to the DMN. To determine the neural substrates of brand equity, we first carried out the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis. We examined 26 studies using branded objects as experimental stimuli for the ALE. Next, we set the output regions from ALE as the region of interest for meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM). Further, we compared the brand equity-related brain network (BE-RBN) revealed by the MACM with the DMN. We confirmed that the BE-RBN brain regions overlap with the medial temporal lobule (MTL) sub-system, a module composed of the DMN but excluding the retrosplenial cortex. Further, we discovered that several brain regions apart from the DMN are also distinctive BE-RBN brain regions (i.e., the insula, the inferior frontal gyrus, amygdala, ventral striatum, parietal region). We decoded the BE-RBN brain regions using the BrandMap module. The decoded results revealed that the brand equity-related mental processes are complex constructs integrated via multiple mental processes such as self-referential, reward, emotional, memory, and sensorimotor processing. Our study demonstrated that the DMN alone is insufficient to engage in brand equity-related mental processes. Therefore, marketers are required to make strategic plans to integrate the five consumer's multiple mental processes while building brand equity. \n  \nConsumer neuroscience, Neuromarketing, DMN, Consumer decision making, ALE, Brand management, fMRI. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nBranded products and services have several advantages over unbranded ones. Consumers are willing to buy branded products at higher prices ( ). They often buy branded products without deliberative thoughts ( ) and have unconsciously favorable perceptions of them ( ). These behaviors tend to be habituated as long as they are satisfied with the products ( ). Thus, most firms manage to add value to general products and services through branding, as this is an important source of financial profit for them ( ). \n\nWhat are the differences between branded and unbranded products? In marketing, these differences are attributed to \u201cbrand equity.\u201d Brand equity can be understood as the strength of influence of a brand name as perceived by customers and the unique value premium that a company makes. Brands enjoying strong brand equity have a competitive edge when compared to their competitors and are therefore placed in an advantageous market position. Brand equity likely leads to higher consumer preferences, purchase intentions, and choice probabilities ( ). Interbrand, which is a representative brand consulting firm, evaluated brand equity among dozens of brands and reported that Apple was considered the world's most valuable brand in 2020 ( ). Apple produces a wide range of product categories and has dominant positions in these markets. Apple's success reveals that brand equity has been a crucial concept in marketing strategies for many decades. \n\nThe method of building brand equity has been theoretically and practically researched for three decades.   organized the brand equity elements into five factors: brand associations, brand name awareness, brand loyalty, perceived brand quality, and other proprietary brand assets such as patents, trademarks, and channel relationships.   defined brand equity as the \u201cdifferential effect of brand knowledge on consumer response to the marketing of the brand.\u201d   referred to brand equity as \u201ca set of mental associations and relationships built up over time among customers or distributors.\u201d Thus, brand equity is an intangible asset residing in consumer's minds unlike tangibles, such as factories and office buildings. \n\nOver the past two decades, neuroscience approaches have been employed in marketing. Many consumer-neuroscience studies have provided important findings about brain regions related to consumers\u2019 decision making toward branded objects. However, these brain regions seem to be distributed in a wide variety of areas and are poorly convergent.   reported that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hippocampus are the brain regions related to strong brand equity when comparing brands with strong and weak equity. In studies on brand personality, which is a critical concept in brand associations,   reported that the MPFC is indeed associated with brand personality. These studies indicated that memory processing plays a crucial role in brand equity-based decision making.   demonstrated that it was not the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) but the inferior frontal gyrus that is related to brand personality judgment and argued that the information processed between a person and brand personality is distinct. They focused on the influences of self-referential processing on brands with brand equity. Meanwhile, according to  , the activation of the ventral striatum (VS) was observed when investigating the brain regions related to favorable brands.   showed that the globus pallidus is related to the preference for a brand with strong equity. They emphasized the involvement of reward processing in brand equity-related mental processes.   showed the amygdala was associated with separation distress in regard to beloved brands. The amygdala is involved in emotional processing ( ;  ). This is the study focused on the emotional processing aspect of brand equity-related mental processes. Thus, although the mental processes corresponding to specified brain regions were examined in previous consumer neuroscience studies, few studies have assessed brand equity-related mental processes from the perspective of functional connectivity in the brain. \n\nMoreover, brand equity-related mental processes, which may derive from the default mode network (DMN), are reported in the marketing literature. Numerous studies reported that the DMN is engaged in inward mental processes, such as recalling the past, wandering mental states, imagining the future, remembering autobiographical memory, self-related functions, scene construction, spontaneous thought, automated responses, decision-making based on system 1, and social cognition ( ;  ;  ). For example, self-related functions are also one of the most important attributes of brand equity related mental processes. A self-expressive benefit is the most crucial value proposition derived from brand equity and is the most representative self-related concept on brand equity ( ). Spontaneous brand recall is an important metric for marketing strategies because it contributes significantly to financial performance ( ). Spontaneous brand recall might be associated with spontaneous thought, a mental process derived from the DMN.   noted the social cognitive aspects of brand equity. Consumers\u2019 decision-making processes including the brand equity-based decision making are one of the behaviors derived from subjective value-based decision making. Several brain regions related to subjective value-based decision making, such as the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), MPFC, VS, medial temporal lobe (MTL), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), have been revealed by neuro imaging meta-analysis studies ( ;  ;  ).   noted resemblances between the DMN and value-based decision making with regard to these activated brain regions.   demonstrated that most of the brain regions related to subjective value-based decision making overlapped with most of the brain regions comprising the DMN. Despite these resemblances between mental processes derived from two distinct sources, such as the DMN and brand equity, no studies have been conducted to assess the overlap of the DMN and brand equity-related regions of the brain. \n\nTherefore, the aim of the present study is to reveal the distinct brain regions related to brand equity and to provide characteristics for brand equity-related mental processes in consumers\u2019 decision making by comparing brain regions involved in both the brain equity-related network (BE-RBN) and the DMN through performing a quantitative meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies. \n\n\n## Materials & methods \n  \nFirst, to compare the brand equity-related brain regions with the DMN-related brain regions, we collected related foci data. Each activation likelihood estimation (ALE) map was created using an ALE method based on each focus. Second, meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) was conducted by setting each cluster of the brand equity-related brain regions, which were produced by an ALE method, as a region of interest (ROI).   pointed out that brain regions identified by MACM are almost equal to brain regions consisting of resting state networks. This means that brain regions identified by the MACM might represent brain regions comprising the BE-RBN. Last, we conducted a conjunction and contrast analysis between the BE-RBN and DMN to reveal overlap and each distinct brain region in both brain networks. We attempted to identify each characteristic mental process derived from these distinct brain regions in both brain networks. Moreover, we assessed publication biases on the ALE results about the brand equity-related brain regions using Fail-Safe N (FSN) analysis. \n\n### Data collection and an ALE method \n  \nFirst, a systematic literature search was performed to select neuro imaging studies on consumers' decision making on branded products and services. The search was conducted using the PubMed database ( ). We included published studies between January 2000 and March 2021 from only peer-reviewed English language journals. We searched for studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with the specific terms \u201cbrand,\u201d \u201cconsumer,\u201d \u201cfMRI,\u201d \u201cneural,\u201d \u201cchoice,\u201d \u201cpurchase,\u201d \u201cdecision-making,\u201d and \u201cpreference.\u201d This search processes yielded 10 for \u201cbrand, fMRI, neural, and choice\u201d; 0 for \u201cbrand, fMRI, neural, and purchase\u201d; 11 for \u201cbrand, fMRI, neural, and decision-making\u201d; 12 for \u201cbrand, fMRI, neural, and preference\u201d; 38 for \u201cconsumer, fMRI, neural, and choice\u201d; 12 for \u201cconsumer, fMRI, neural, and purchase\u201d; 48 for \u201cconsumer, fMRI, neural, and decision-making\u201d; and 26 for \u201cconsumer, fMRI, neural, and preference.\u201d We then added the studies listed in Plassmann's ( ) literature lists on branding. Studies were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) studies that conducted fMRI scans of healthy participants, (2) studies that were conducted in a consumption context, (3) studies where branded objects were used as experimental stimuli, for example, products, logo, advertising with brand logos, and (4) those that reported activations as three-dimensional coordinates in the stereotactic space of Talairach or the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). Moreover, in this study, we included studies for this meta-analysis, regardless of types of stimulus materials for experiments, such as foods, consumer package goods, and durable goods. We excluded studies that did not meet these criteria. However, there were a few exceptions to the inclusion and exclusion. Two studies ( ;  ) did not directly use branded objects as experimental stimuli. However, they were ultimately included in quantitative synthesis because these stimuli were regarded as objects similar to branded ones. These two studies were also included in Plassmann's lists ( ). Additionally, we excluded  , despite using products with logos as experimental stimuli. We considered the attractiveness of their stimuli equal to that of unbranded objects because they controlled for attractiveness between branded and unbranded products. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram ( ) provide details of the screening process. Twenty-six studies were included in the present meta-analysis (Supplementary Table\u00a0S1).   \nPrisma flow diagram. \n  Figure\u00a01   \n\nSecond, for the DMN, foci were collected by searching relevant studies via Sleuth version 3.0.4 ( ). The search criteria were set according to   as follows: (1) Context in Experiments is \u201cNormal Mapping\u201d; (2) Activation in Experiments is \u201cDeactivation\u201d; and (3) Control in Experiments is \u201cLow level\u201d. The matching results yielded 93 papers that included 185 experiments, 1,631 foci, and 1,510 subjects. \n\nThe entire activation foci in the Talairach space were converted to the MNI space via a transformation algorithm ( ). Thus, these foci, selected across a wide variety of experiment conditions such as stimuli and task, were used in this study. \n\nThe ALE method ( ) was adopted for the following reasons. First, it is the most popular quantitative meta-analysis method ( ). Second, the BrainMap platform ( ) contains all the necessary tools for an ALE analysis ( ;  ). The GingerALE software calculates an ALE algorism based on the reported foci. Sleuth software is a tool for curating studies to match set conditions, such as experimental tasks, locations, and subjects. Mango software ( ), an associated software of the BrainMap platform, is a visualization tool for the resulting ALE maps and various NIfTI files and implements a decoding analysis tool based on the BrainMap database. In addition to these tools, the BrainMap platform is equipped with a plethora of other functions for neuro imaging meta-analysis. Finally, given that significant brain imaging meta-analysis studies regarding subjective value-based decision-making have been conducted using ALE ( ;  ;  ;  ), adopting an ALE method to assess our results may prove beneficial when comparing findings from these previous studies. It is a coordinate-based quantitative meta-analysis method, and its procedures are as follows. First, the modeled activation map was created by applying three-dimensional Gaussian probability density function to each individual focus. Similar procedures were conducted on all foci of selected studies. With increased convergence of reported foci, across studies, there has been a gradual minimization in the variance of Gaussian probability distribution. This means that the contingency of reported foci in each individual study is expected to be eliminated. Second, an ALE map was obtained by calculating the union of these modeled activation maps. Finally, to create a more accurate ALE map, it was compared with the randomness map created by null distribution. Concretely, the thresholded ALE map was obtained by conducting a permutation test for assessing differentiations between these maps at each voxel ( ;  ). The ALE method was conducted using the GingerALE version 3.02 tool ( ). The thresholding analyses were performed using a cluster-level correction for multiple comparisons at p = 0.05, with a cluster-forming threshold of p = 0.001. The permutation size was set to 1000. In the present study, coordinates were reported in the MNI space. The complete images with brain activations were output as NIfTI files and overlaid onto a canonical anatomical T1 brain template in MNI space using the Mango software (version 4.1;  ). \n\n\n### MACM \n  \nMACM is a method to identify co-activation brain regions related to a set ROI by curating the studies in the BrainMap database ( ;  ). The BrainMap has two kinds of databases: a functional database and a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) database. This study used a functional database, which contains 3,406 papers, 111 paradigm classes, 76,016 subjects, and 131,598 experiments. To calculate statistically significant co-activated brain regions with the set ROI, mathematical methods are executed based on curated foci. We adopted an ALE method ( ), and used the GingerALE version 3.02 tool ( ) to perform the calculation. The thresholding analyses were performed using a cluster-level correction for multiple comparisons at p = 0.05, with a cluster-forming threshold of p = 0.001. The permutation size was set to 1,000. \n\n\n### Conjunction and contrast analysis \n  \nThe conjunction and contrast analysis between the BE-RBN and the DMN were conducted using the GingerALE version 3.02 tool ( ). Different brain regions from these two networks were compared to brain regions generated from a null distribution according to statistically appropriate criteria. Thus, this analysis identified statistically significant overlap and each distinct brain region between the BE-RBN and the DMN. For this analysis, the thresholding criteria were set as follows: P-value = p < 0.05, number of permutations = 1,000, and minimum cluster size = 100 mm . \n\n\n### Decoding analysis \n  \nWe decoded both shared and each distinct brain region, BE-RBN and DMN, using the behavioral analysis plugin, a brain image analysis application provided by the BrainMap platform ( ). This plugin tool is implemented in Mango software (version 4.1;  ). This plugin tool enables the analysis of behaviors and cognitive functions regarding the set ROI. This tool was developed based on the BrainMap database. Foci corresponding with five behavioral domains (\u201cAction\u201d, \u201cCognition\u201d, \u201cEmotion\u201d, \u201cInteroception\u201d, and \u201cPerception\u201d) are organized in the BrainMap database. Moreover, these behavioral domains are classified into sixty sub-domains. For example, the Action domain has eight sub-domains such as \u201cExecution (Speech)\u201d, \u201cExecution (Unspecified)\u201d, \u201cImagination\u201d, \u201cInhibition\u201d, \u201cMotor Learning\u201d, \u201cObservation\u201d, \u201cPreparation\u201d, and \u201cRest\u201d. Thus, the sub-domain items are detailed profiles of behavioral domains. The detailed items of the sub-domains are listed on the BrainMap home page ( ). Given that each activated focus has a unique sub-domain tag, characteristic items of sub-domains corresponding with the set specific ROI can be calculated by significance testing. This is a method of comparing observed probabilities of sub-domain items within the set specific ROI with probabilities generated from the null distribution. Therefore, statistically significant behavioral and cognitive profiles within the ROI can be calculated. An item is considered significant if its z-score is above 3.0. This criterion was determined based on a bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (p \u2264 0.05). Thus, because the correspondences between sub-domains and brain regions were statistically validated, the usage of the plugin can be expected to avoid a reverse inference problem ( ). Given that the plugin is provided using the Talairach template, the ROI created on the MNI template is needed to transform the MNI space to Talairach space. \n\n\n### Fail-Safe N for the results of ALE on brand equity related brain regions \n  \nAlthough the coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) such as ALE have rigorous methods, publication biases are important concerns. To assess this problem, we validated the publication biases of our ALE results for brand equity related brain regions by conducting FSN analysis. FSN refers to the maximum number of studies that alter results obtained by a meta-analysis. Thus, the larger the number of FSN, the more robust the results obtained by meta-analysis. According to  , there is an estimation for normal mapping in that a confidence interval with 95% for the number of studies that report no local maxima varies from 5 to 30 per 100 published studies. Thus, given that 94 experiments are contained in our study, unpublished experiments were estimated at 28 and the minimum FSN was also set as 28. We calculated the FSN in each cluster in our ALE results based on the procedure described by  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### ALE \n  \nIn terms of activation foci related to brand equity, the meta-analysis identified significant convergence in five clusters ( ;  -(a)(b) (c)). These clusters were located in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC, BA32, ventral MPFC [VMPFC]), the medial frontal gyrus (MFG, BA10), the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG, the entorhinal cortex <BA28>, hippocampus), the caudate head (the anterior part of ventral striatum), the posterior cingulate cortex <PCC> (the retrosplenial cortex <RSC>; BA29, BA30), and the lingual gyrus. These five clusters were used as ROIs for the MACM ( (d)).   \nRegional foci of brain activation by the ALE (Brand equity related brain regions). \n  Table\u00a01       \nResults of activation likelihood estimation values for brand equity (cluster-level P\u2009<\u20090.05, cluster-forming threshold at voxel level: P\u2009<\u20090.001).

Brain regions with the highest ALE value within each cluster were as follows: posterior cingulate cortex (PCC, BA23, Cluster1), rACC (BA32, VMPFC, Cluster2), inferior parietal lobule (IPL, BA40, Cluster3), middle temporal gyrus (MTG, BA39, Cluster4), PHG (amygdala, Cluster5), middle frontal gyrus (MFG, BA8, Cluster6), middle temporal gyrus (MTG, BA39, Cluster7), PHG (hippocampus, Cluster8), and middle frontal gyrus (MFG, BA8, Cluster9).   \nRegional foci of brain activation by the ALE (DMN related brain regions). \n  Table\u00a02       \nActivated brain regions of both the default mode network and the brand equity related brain network.

We created the five ROIs according to the five clusters of brand equity-related brain regions using Mango software. Foci relevant to each ROI were curated via the BrainMap database using the Sleuth software. The search criteria were as follows: (1) Context in Experiments is \u201cNormal Mapping\u201d; (2) Activation in Experiments is \u201cDeactivation\u201d; (3) Control in Experiments is \u201cLow level\u201d; and (4) MNI image in Location is \u201ceach ROI corresponding to each cluster\u201d that we created. The matching results in cluster1 yielded 19 papers that included 23 experiments, 448 foci, and 365 subjects. The matching results in cluster2 yielded 18 papers that included 22 experiments, 353 foci, and 323 subjects. The matching results in cluster3 yielded 14 papers that included 14 experiments, 325 foci, and 254 subjects. The matching results in cluster4 yielded 2 papers that included 2 experiments, 25 foci, and 59 subjects. The matching results in cluster5 yielded 8 papers that included 8 experiments, 195 foci, and 116 subjects. The MACM input data were constructed by aggregating these foci. After two duplicated foci were eliminated, 1,297 foci were adopted as the MACM input data. The MACM results are shown in   and  (b).   \nRegional foci of brain activation by the MACM (Brand equity-related brain network). \n  Table\u00a03     \n\nSignificant activated brain regions were divided into 13 clusters. Brain regions with the highest ALE value within each cluster are as follows: caudate (caudate body, Cluster1), claustrum (Cluster2), superior frontal gyrus (SFG, dorsal medial prefrontal cortex <DMPFC>, BA6, Cluster3), PHG (amygdala, Cluster4), MFG (MPFC, BA9, Cluster5), precentral gyrus (PreCG, BA4, Cluster6), superior temporal gyrus (STG, Cluster7), precentral gyrus (PreCG, BA6, Cluster7), PHG (amygdala, Cluster8), superior temporal gyrus (STG, BA22, Cluster9), superior temporal gyrus (STG, BA22, Cluster10), rACC (VMPFC, Cluster11), superior temporal gyrus (STG, BA22, Cluster11), and superior temporal gyrus (STG, BA22, Cluster12). Interestingly, even though the posterior regions were set as the ROIs, these regions disappeared. However, when setting loose thresholding criteria (uncorrected p < 0.01), these regions appeared. There is a concern about publication bias in these regions because of the FSN analysis results. Thus, the ALE map created by the MACM can be considered robust because brain regions derived from clusters with publication biases were eliminated. The result is partially consistent with results of previous subjective value-based decision-making studies even though the activations of the PCC were observed in a few of them ( ;  ;  ;  ). This means that connections between the posterior region and other brain regions might be weak in the BE-RBN in comparison with a few subjective value-based decision making. The activations of the PCC seem to depend on types of reward modalities and decision-making modes ( ;  ;  ;  ). Therefore, along with an activated position of the VMPFC, investigating the activation of the PCC is a useful cue for assessing reward modalities of brand equity. \n\n\n### Conjunction and contrast analysis \n  \n#### Conjunction analysis \n  \nThe ALE map produced by conjunction analysis revealed five clusters in overlapping brain regions across both the BE-RBN and DMN ( ;  (a)): the rACC (cluster 1), MPFC (cluster 2), PHG (cluster 3, 4), and caudate (caudate head, VS; cluster 5). In particular, brain regions within the PHG were activated across cluster3 and cluster4. These regions were composed of the amygdala and entorhinal cortex (BA28, BA34). Therefore, the anterior part of the medial prefrontal region, the medial temporal region, and the ventral striatum were revealed as significantly characteristic brain regions shared between the BE-RBN and DMN. This result is almost the same as that found by  , excluding the PCC.   \nThe results of conjunction analysis (BE-RBN & DMN). \n  Table\u00a04       \nResults of conjunction and contrast analysis.

The brain regions revealed in each cluster are as follows: claustrum (Cluster1), insula (Cluster2), SFG (DMPFC, BA6, Cluster3), lentiform nucleus (medial globus pallidus <MGP>, Cluster4), MFG (MFPC, BA9, Cluster5), precentral gyrus (PreCG, BA4, Cluster6), precentral gyrus (PreCG, BA6, Cluster7), precentral gyrus (PreCG, BA6, Cluster8), lentiform nucleus (lateral globus pallidus <LGP>, Cluster9), superior temporal gyrus (STG, BA22, Cluster10), superior temporal gyrus (STG, BA22, Cluster11), postcentral gyrus (PoCG, BA40, Cluster12), and rACC (BA32, VMPFC, Cluster13). Cluster1 broadly covers brain regions including the insula, striatum, and lateral cortical regions such as the STG, inferior frontal gyrus, and PreCG. Both cluster4 and cluster8 cover the VS, the bilateral PHG, including the amygdala and entorhinal cortex (BA28, BA34). Although the MPFC corresponds to cluster3, cluster5, and cluster13, the positions of these clusters are different. Cluster3 is placed at the dorsal MPFC, while both cluster5 and cluster13 are placed at the ventral MPFC. Clusters 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12 broadly cover the lateral parts of the cortical regions, excluding the posterior parts. Interestingly, the insula is included in clusters 1, 2, 9, and 10. The anterior insula corresponds to clusters 1 and 2, while the posterior insula corresponds to clusters 9 and 10. Moreover, although the PHG and the VS were observed in overlapping regions between the BE-RBN and DMN, these regions were also detected in this contrast analysis. This means that these regions might have more intensive and varied commitments to functions of the BE-RBN than the DMN. Although   demonstrated that the MPFC was characteristically activated in the more anterior part of the subjective value network than in the DMN, this study showed that the activated MPFC was observed in the posterior parts in comparison with the regions observed in the DMN.   \nThe result of the contrast analysis (BE-RBN > DMN). \n  Table\u00a05     \n\nFor the DMN, distinct brain regions were divided into eight clusters ( ;  (c)). The brain regions revealed in each cluster are as follows: middle cingulate cortex (MCC, BA31, cluster 1), middle temporal gyrus (MTG, BA39, cluster 2), SFG (BA8, cluster 3), medial frontal gyrus (MFG, MPFC, cluster 4), medial frontal gyrus (MFG, MPFC, BA10, cluster 5), subcallosal gyrus (MFG, MPFC, BA25, cluster 6), medial frontal gyrus (MFG, MPFC, BA11, cluster 7), and middle temporal gyrus (MTG, BA39, cluster 8). Cluster1 comprised brain regions covering the medial to lateral areas of the posterior cortical region. Most of the brain regions of the PCC were included in cluster1. The MPFC corresponded to clusters 4, 5, 6, and 7. In clusters 4 and 5, the anterior parts of the MPFC were activated. In clusters 5 and 6, subgenual parts of the MPFC were activated. Thus, for the DMN, characteristically activated brain regions were broadly distributed in the MPFC and PCC. These regions have been known as the core modules composing the DMN core network ( ). The MPFC is the module of the anterior DMN, while the PCC is the module of the posterior DMN.   \nThe result of the contrast analysis (BE-RBN < DMN). \n  Table\u00a06     \n\n\n\n### Decoding analysis \n  \nTo decode the revealed distinctive and shared brain regions between the BE-RBN and the DMN using the behavioral analysis plugin tool, we created the ROIs based on the Talairach coordinate template using Mango software. The Talairach template was created by modifying the MNI template with the transform function in Mango software. All ROIs were created according to brain region clusters revealed by the conjunction and contrast analysis, and spherical ROIs were constructed. We set each radius of these ROIs to match the actual clusters\u2019 volume size. For example, the volume of cluster 1 in the result of conjunction analysis was 1752 mm , and the radius was set as 7.478mm. The radius was set similarly for other clusters as well.

Significant domains and sub-domains in behavior and cognitive function were observed in only two clusters (cluster 1 and 3). In cluster 1, \u201cEmotion, Positive (Reward/Gain)\u201d and \u201cCognition, Reasoning\u201d were significant. In cluster3, \u201cCognition, Memory (Explicit)\u201d and \u201cPerception, Vision (Unspecified)\u201d were significant.   \nThe results of the decoding analysis. \n  Table\u00a07     \n\nIn significantly activated brain regions in the BE-RBN (BE-RBN > DMN), significantly characteristic behavior and cognitive function taxonomy were observed in nine clusters (clusters 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11). Detailed results are shown in  . Multiple domains (four domains or more were included) were listed in clusters 1, 2, 3, and 8. The \u201cEmotional\u201d domain was dominant in cluster 4, while the \u201cCognitive\u201d domain occupied cluster 6. The \u201cPerception\u201d domain was included in all clusters where significant sub-domains were observed. Regarding the sub-domains, the \u201cPositive (Reward/Gain)\u201d was listed in all clusters that included the \u201cEmotional\u201d domain. On the other hand, the \u201cLanguage\u201d related sub-domain was listed in all clusters that included the \u201cCognitive\u201d domain. In particular, \u201cLanguage (Speech)\u201d covered all clusters that included the \u201cCognitive\u201d domain. \u201cLanguage (Semantic)\u201d was included in four clusters (clusters 1, 2, 3, and 6). In the \u201cCognitive\u201d domain, other characteristic sub-domains were \u201cAttention\u201d, \u201cMemory (Explicit)\u201d, and \u201cReasoning\u201d. \u201cAttention\u201d was included in five clusters (clusters 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8), and both \u201cMemory (Explicit)\u201d and \u201cReasoning\u201d were included in four clusters (clusters 1, 2, 3, and 8). Interestingly, although the \u201cInteroception\u201d domain has 11 sub-domains, only two sub-domains (\u201cSexuality\u201d and \u201cThermoregulation\u201d) were significant. In particular, \u201cSexuality\u201d was listed in all clusters that included the \u201cInteroception\u201d domain (clusters 1, 2, 4, and 8). Regarding the sub-domains of \u201cPerception\u201d, any of those related to the five senses (\u201cAudition\u201d, \u201cGustation\u201d, \u201cOlfaction\u201d, \u201cSomesthesis\u201d, and \u201cVision\u201d) were listed in each cluster that included significant sub-domains. Regarding the sub-domains of \u201cAction\u201d, four sub-domains (\u201cExecution [Speech]\u201d, \u201cExecution [Unspecified]\u201d, \u201cImagination\u201d and \u201cInhibition\u201d) were significant. \u201cExecution (Speech)\u201d was listed in all clusters that included the \u201cAction\u201d domain (clusters 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 10). \n\nIn significantly activated brain regions in the DMN (BE-RBN < DMN), significant sub-domains were observed only in cluster 1: \u201cCognition, Social cognition\u201d and \u201cCognition, Memory (Explicit)\u201d. \n\n\n### FSN analysis \n  \nThe cluster-wise data on FSN is shown in Supplementary Table\u00a0S2. The number of FSN in clusters 1\u20133 highly exceeded the minimum FSN. Especially regarding clusters 1 and 2, the FSN analysis was stopped at the maximum FSN because the cluster was significant at even the maximum FSN. The FSN analysis in these clusters proved that the ALE results on brand related brain regions were robust against potential publication bias. However, the \u201cfile drawer problem\u201d was confirmed in cluster 4 and 5 because the number of FSN in these clusters were smaller than the minimum FSN. Hence, robustness of the ALE results in these clusters is considered to be low. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nBroad, overlapping regions were observed in the MPFC. Especially, as shown in the decoding analysis, the VMPFC plays a crucial role in computing and integrating subjectively experienced reward values derived from different kinds of reward stimuli ( ), including ratings of pleasantness ( ), tracking of the value of financial payoffs ( ), and emotional processes ( ). The amygdala is associated with emotional processing ( ;  ). However, the \u201cEmotional\u201d domain was not significant in the decoding analysis. The VS is associated with reward processing. The VS encodes expected reward values and negative values, such as punishments ( ). Its anterior parts are associated with positive rewards such as euphoria ( ). The VS also plays a key role in reward-related approaches and avoidance behaviors ( ).   reported that the VS is the core region that represents the values of utilitarian and hedonistic goods. A large number of studies has shown correlations between the VS and rewards. Activities in this area are associated with the magnitude of cumulative rewards ( ), anticipation of reward ( ), and social rewards such as evaluation of faces ( ), reputation, and social hierarchy ( ). Thus, the VS is thought to compute reward values, which are prediction errors between expected rewards and outcomes ( ). Moreover, the VMPFC and the VS were crucial modules of the neural common currency (NCC) network ( ;  ). These brain areas are dopaminergic midbrain regions and are known as the core regions of the NCC hypothesis. In the NCC hypothesis, subjective values are thought to be encoded in the same brain regions by a single scale, regardless of reward type. Many empirical studies have proven this hypothesis ( ). Activities in these areas are associated with various types of subjective reward magnitude ( ), the subjective valuations of gains and losses in behavioral loss aversion ( ), discount function, subjective values of delayed monetary rewards ( ), and outcome values of rewards ( ). Given that the decoded results showed that \u201cPositive (Reward/Gain)\u201d was significant in these regions, it can be considered that these regions are also associated with reward processing. Although, both the VS and amygdala are considered crucial modules of reward networks ( ;  ), \u201cPositive (Reward/Gain)\u201d was not significant in clusters 4 and 5. The VMPFC and entorhinal cortex are both core components of the medial temporal lobule (MTL) subsystem in the DMN. The MTL subsystem is involved in episodic and autobiographical memory ( ). The decoded result shows that \u201cCognition, Memory (Explicit)\u201d was significant in cluster 3. Thus, the overlapping brain regions can be considered to be functions of self-referential, reward, memory processing. \n\nAlthough the PHG (the amygdala and entorhinal cortex <BA28, BA34>) overlapped with the BE-RBN and DMN, broadly strong activations in these regions were also observed in the brain regions of \u201cthe BE-RBN > the DMN\u201d. Interactions between the amygdala and entorhinal cortex in the PHG were engaged in the formation of emotional episodic memory ( ;  ), emotional autobiographical memory ( ) and associative memory related to episodic memories ( ). These considerations are consistent with the decoded results. Regarding these regions that correspond with cluster 4 and 8 (BE-RBN > DMN) in the decoding analysis, both many sub-domains of the \u201cEmotional\u201d and \u201cMemory (Explicit)\u201d sub-domains were significant in cluster 8. Additionally, in these clusters, \u201cPerception\u201d (sub-domain; \u201cVision\u201d and \u201cOlfaction\u201d) was also significant. The PHG is involved in associative memories related to visuospatial and odor information ( ;  ;  ).   reported that autobiographical memories related to odor information was more vividly recalled than other sensory information ( ). \n\nIn contrast, the contrast analysis (BE-RBN > DMN) result showed that the insula covered four clusters (clusters 1, 2, 9, and 10). This indicates that the insula can be considered a distinct brand equity-related brain region. The insula is engaged in various emotional and cognitive mental processes derived from self-generated interoceptive feelings ( ;  ;  ). Since the anterior insula is the center of the salience network, it has connections with the amygdala and VS ( ;  ;  ). \n\nThe interconnections among these brain regions are associated with behaviors driven by impulsive feelings, such as addiction, sexual emotion, and drug abuse ( ;  ). Actually, the \u201cSexuality\u201d sub-domain in the \u201cInteroception\u201d domain was significant in clusters that demonstrated these connections (i.e., clusters 1, 2, 4 and 8 [BE-RBN > DMN]). As shown in the decoded result that \u201cPositive (Reward/Gain)\u201d was significant in clusters 1 and 2, activations in the anterior insula were observed in the reward and value-based decision-making contexts ( ;  ;  ;  ).   reported that the anterior insula is engaged in risk learning in risky decision making ( ). In addition, the posterior insula has connections with the sensorimotor cortex and the parietal cortex (i.e., the precentral gyrus and the postcentral gyrus;  ,  ;  ). These regions play a crucial role in sensorimotor processing ( ). Similar to the anterior insula, the posterior insula is also involved in visceral processing such as sexual emotion ( ). These considerations were partly proven in the decoding analysis. The \u201cperception\u201d domain was significant in clusters that demonstrated an interconnection among the posterior insula, sensorimotor cortex, and parietal cortex (i.e., clusters 6, 7, 9, and 10). However, the \u201cSexuality\u201d sub-domain in the \u201cInteroception\u201d domain was not significant in these clusters. Additionally, the results for clusters 1, 2, and 3 showed that semantic memory-related sub-domains such as \u201cLanguage (Semantic)\u201d and \u201cCognition, Memory (Explicit)\u201d were significant. The IFG (clusters 1,2) and SFG (DMPFC, cluster 3) included in these clusters are both associated with semantic memory ( ), implying its influence on brand equity-related mental processes. Connections of the DMPFC, IFG, and PHG are involved in semantic associative memory ( ). This interpretation is consistent with the findings of previous consumer neuroscience studies ( ;  ;  ). Interconnections within the DMPFC, the IFG and the PHG are associated with familiarity, along with various sensory modalities such as visual and music ( ;  ,  ). Taking into consideration the discussion on episodic and autobiographical memory as described above, memory processing plays a crucial role in brand equity-related mental processes. In particular, the comprehensive associative memory system, which includes semantic, episodic and autobiographical memories, may be intensively involved in brand association facet, which is a component of brand equity. Brand associations is a construct of combining brand name with brand knowledge, including multiple modalities derived from marketing communications and other experiences between brands and consumers ( ;  ). Constructing a comprehensive associative memory system might generate a sense of familiarity toward brands. Therefore, brand association can be considered as a construct centrally functioned by the PHG. Moreover, given that activations of the PHG, which is located primarily in the entorhinal cortex <BA28, BA34>, were not reported in previous subjective value-based decision-making studies ( ;  ;  ;  ), the associative memory system driven by the PHG can be presumed to be a distinct, characteristic mental process among various value-based decision-making processes. When combined, brain regions in \u201cBE-RBN > DMN\u201d are considered to play a role in self-referential, reward, emotional, memory and sensorimotor processing. \n\nIn contrast, the contrast analysis (BE-RBN < DMN) revealed that the anterior areas of both the MPFC (aMPFC) and PCC are the main distinctive brain regions in the DMN. The aMPFC and PCC are both crucial core nodes in the various types of DMN subsystem studies ( ;  ). The aMPFC is the core node of the anterior DMN ( ). The PCC is the core node of the posterior DMN ( ). The aMPFC is involved in the shifting of attention to future directions, the imaging of future results ( ), and imaging future outcomes ( ). The increased activations in the PCC were observed when simulating the future and when reflecting on the future self ( ;  ). This region is also involved in social cognitions such as simulating others' mental state and theory of mind ( ;  ). In addition, the retrosplenial regions of the PCC have connections with the MTL, the region associated with episodic and autobiographical memory ( ;  ). Although these mental processes were not significant regarding the aMPFC, both the \u201cSocial cognition\u201d and \u201cMemory (Explicit)\u201d sub-domains were significant in the PCC. Compared with the BE-RBN, given that the PCC might be the strongly distinctive brain region, social cognition-related mental processes can be considered as characteristic in the DMN. While activations of the PCC were observed in other value-based decision-making studies ( ;  ;  ;  ), no activations were observed in the BE-RBN.   Thus, the brand equity related mental processes are presumed to be a construct with weak social cognitive aspects, although the \u201cSocial Cognition\u201d sub-domain was significant in cluster 3 of the contrast analysis (BERBN > DMN).   From the view of reward modalities, although activations of the PCC were observed in monetary rewards, little activations of the PCC were shown in primary (food, erotic) and aesthetic rewards ( ;  ;  ). Moreover, a few studies pointed out that abstract rewards, such as money, are encoded in the more anterior parts of the VMPFC ( ;  ). Conversely, primary rewards, which include foods and erotic stimuli, are encoded in the more posterior parts of the VMPFC ( ;  ). According to  , activations of the posterior part of the VMPFC were observed in aesthetic processing ( ). The VMPFC's activated areas in the BE-RBN were located in its posterior parts. As a result of activated position of the VMPFC and deactivations of the PCC, a brand with brand equity can be considered a less abstract reward akin to primary and aesthetic rewards. \n\nTherefore, while we revealed that the BE-RBN overlaps with the MPFC and the MTL sub-system, excluding the PCC retrosplenial regions, we also identified several distinctive brain regions of the BE-RBN apart from the DMN, such as the IFG, insula, VS and parietal regions. This result indicates that the function of the DMN alone might be insufficient to engage in brand equity-related mental processes. Moreover, the decoded results demonstrate that these brain regions are associated with self-referential processing, reward processing, emotional processing, memory processing and sensorimotor processing. Thus, brand equity-related mental processes can be considered as complex constructs composed of these multiple mental processes. Thus, although each mental process has been observed in previous consumer neuroscience studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), brand equity-related mental processes can be considered complex constructs in which these multiple mental processes are integrated. In other words, they can be interpreted as subjective and rewards processing, involving an impulsive emotional associative memory system with multiple sensory modalities inputted. These findings imply that the DMN-like mental processes, such as spontaneous brand recall and self-expressive benefit reported in the marketing literature, can be a construct underlined by not only the DMN, but also other brain networks.   The influence of social cognitive processing on the brand equity-related mental processes is considered to be marginal.   For instance, self-expressive benefit allows brands to realize symbols of a person's self-concept ( ). A consumer wants to be perceived as a creative person by using Apple, or as a sophisticated and elegant person by using Lancome, regardless of the consumer's current status. When an individual watches advertising, sees a logo while walking in the street, or reads news on an SNS, their emotions about a brand would accumulate. Thus, consumers' motivation to purchase brands is to realize their aspirations ( ). This accumulated desire to fulfill self-oriented objectives, along with their aspirations, can be attributed to subjective and reward processing with strong emotional associative memories. \n\nEven though our study has its strengths and we showed that our ALE results, which were used as ROIs for the MACM, were robust by using FSN analysis, it also has a few limitations. First, although we revealed brain regions related to brand equity by aggregating studies using branded objects as stimuli, we did not consider studies using non-branded objects as stimuli. To specify characteristic brain regions in association with brand equity, it would be more desirable for us to compare brand regions related to brand equity with those related to non-branded objects. In our next study, we will perform this comparison. Moreover, we need to assess differentiations between branded objects and non-branded objects in terms of reward modalities. It is especially important to investigate variations on VMPFC positions between them. Regarding this issue, to more precisely identify distinct mental processes of brand equity-related value-based decision making, we need to compare these consumer contextual reward modalities with general reward modalities such as monetary, primary, and aesthetic modalities with rigorous methods. In addition, we noted that memory processing may be a characteristic mental process related to brand equity-related decision-making. However, to precisely identify its characteristic mental processes, BE-RBN needs to be directly compared to the other value-based decision-making brain networks. Second, we conducted an analysis using cross-sectional selected studies that covered various kinds of tasks, stimulus types, and product categories. While this approach has the advantage of being able to take universal outcomes, weak explanatory regions might emerge. For example, there might be differences in brain activated regions in brand equity between brands selling durable versus fast-moving consumer goods. Similarly, even if stimuli might be in the same product category, there may be different brain activated patterns depending on respondents\u2019 profiles, such as age, gender, and personality. Additionally, as a minor point, although spherical ROIs set for decoding analysis were created to match the size of the actual clusters revealed by the ALE analysis, there are some errors in comparison to the size of the actual clusters. For this reason, the decoded results in some clusters might be of low precision. Our study is of great significance for brand equity studies. However, further research is needed. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe revealed that the BE-RBN is a neural mechanism mainly underlined by interactions among the DMPFC, VMPFC, IFG, insula, PHG, VS, and parietal regions. Given that each brain region is a component of a few brain networks (i.e., the DMN, the salience network, the NCC network and sensorimotor network), the BE-RBN can be considered as a neural mechanism interplayed by multiple brain networks. This implies that the DMN limitedly influences the brand equity-related mental processes. From the decoded results, we identified that the mental processes of brand equity are a complex construct that integrates multiple mental processing (i.e., self-referential, reward, emotion, memory, sensorimotor). Our study shows that a brand is not just a reward. For a brand in food category, it could be difficult to build brand equity by only providing good taste. To build brand equity, it might be insufficient to only communicate self-relevant content to consumers through digital media using a machine learning algorithm. Marketers need to conduct initiatives to stimulate consumers' senses and provide experiences to consumers from omnidirectional contact points. These stimuli and experiences must be comfortable, beneficial, and made from the activation of consumers' self-relevant memories. Therefore, marketers need to execute initiatives to integrate consumers' mental processes related while building brand equity. In addition, our results provide guidelines for measuring brand equity. Consequently, marketers need to set multiple variables covering the five mental processes of the consumer (i.e., self-referential, reward, emotion, memory, and sensorimotor) if they would like to comprehensively detect consumers\u2019 perceptions regarding brand equity. Our findings may contribute to more accurate brand equity studies. \n\n\n## Declarations \n  \n### Author contribution statement \n  \nShinya Watanuki: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper. \n\nHiroyuki Akama: Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data. \n\n\n### Funding statement \n  \nDr. SHINYA Watanuki was supported by   [JP20K13633]. \n\n\n### Data availability statement \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author. \n\n\n### Declaration of interest's statement \n  \nThe authors declare no conflict of interest. \n\n\n### Additional information \n  \nNo additional information is available for this paper. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9207674, "text_md5": "ab04e9166180b815372b20259e3ed3b7", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 36], "journal": [37, 44], "publication_year": [46, 50], "title": [61, 165], "keywords": [179, 271], "abstract": [284, 2445], "body": [2454, 53534]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 35734557, "doi": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09702", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9207674", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9207674"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9207674\">9207674</a>", "list_title": "PMC9207674  Neural substrates of brand equity: applying a quantitative meta-analytical method for neuroimage studies"}
