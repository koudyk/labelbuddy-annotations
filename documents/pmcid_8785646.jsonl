It has been well documented that PTSD is associated with multiple functional disruptions in the brain that appear to underscore unique symptom presentations of the disorder (Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ). Real\u2010time fMRI neurofeedback (rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB) allows for such neural disruptions to be noninvasively regulated; as such rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB has been implemented in a broad range of prevalent psychiatric conditions (Linden et\u00a0al.,  ; Kirsch et\u00a0al.,  ; Li et\u00a0al.,  ; Schoenberg and David,  ; Paret et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Young et\u00a0al.,  ; Mehler et\u00a0al.,  ), including PTSD (Gerin et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Zotev et\u00a0al.,  ; Zweerings et\u00a0al.,  ; Chiba et\u00a0al.,  ; Misaki et\u00a0al.,  ; Weaver et\u00a0al.,  ). Neurobiologically informed treatment interventions are particularly in demand for PTSD as suboptimal response rates to psychotherapy and pharmacological interventions have been reported (Bradley et\u00a0al.,  ; Stein et\u00a0al.,  ; Ravindran and Stein,  ; Haagen et\u00a0al.,  ; Krystal et\u00a0al.,  ), where dropout rates remain high, particularly during trauma\u2010focused interventions (Bisson et\u00a0al.,  ; Goetter et\u00a0al.,  ; Kehle\u2010Forbes et\u00a0al.,  ; Lewis et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nIn response to this demand, emerging scientific evidence suggests that directly regulating specific brain areas associated with PTSD symptomatology may be a viable treatment option for those affected by this illness (Reiter et\u00a0al.,  ; Van der Kolk et\u00a0al.,  ; Panisch & Hai,  ; Chiba et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Rogel et\u00a0al.,  ). It has been hypothesized that normalizing the neural circuitry within large scale intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) is an essential treatment avenue for reducing PTSD symptoms (Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ; Koek et\u00a0al.,  ; Szeszko & Yehuda,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Sheynin et\u00a0al.,  ). Default mode network (DMN) functional disruptions among individuals with PTSD are thought to be related to traumatic/negative autobiographical memories, distorted and dysregulated self\u2010referential processing, and alterations in social cognition (Bluhm et\u00a0al.,  ; Daniels et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ; Tursich et\u00a0al.,  ; Akiki et\u00a0al.,  ; Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ; Hinojosa et\u00a0al.,  ; Frewen et\u00a0al.,  ; Terpou et\u00a0al.,  ). Indeed, to suffer from PTSD can be described as living with a disrupted self\u2010narrative (Gerge,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ), where among individuals with PTSD, especially with early childhood maltreatment, there typically exists a highly rudimentary or shattered sense\u2010of\u2010self (Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nThe posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is the major hub of the posterior default mode network (DMN) (Greicius et\u00a0al.,  ; Buckner et\u00a0al.,  ; Spreng et\u00a0al.,  ; Qin and Northoff,  ; Akiki et\u00a0al.,  ). The PCC and the DMN are highly associated with PTSD symptoms, and display disrupted functional connectivity both at rest (Bluhm et\u00a0al.,  ; Sripada et\u00a0al.,  ; Chen & Etkin,  ; Tursich et\u00a0al.,  ; Yehuda et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ; Koch et\u00a0al.,  ; Akiki et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Barredo et\u00a0al.,  ; Hinojosa et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ) and during executive functioning tasks in PTSD (Daniels\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Melara et\u00a0al.,  ). During rest, it has been shown previously using graph theoretical analyses that connectivity within the posterior community of the DMN involving the PCC and precuneus may be increased, relative to decreased connectivity within the anterior community of the DMN involving the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (Shang et\u00a0al.,  ; Kennis et\u00a0al.,  ; Akiki et\u00a0al.,  ; Holmes et\u00a0al.,  ). Additionally, studies exploring seed\u2010based functional connectivity patterns within the DMN at rest have revealed decreased coupling between the PCC, vmPFC, and other DMN structures, which together have been associated with PTSD symptoms (Bluhm et\u00a0al.,  ; Qin et\u00a0al.,  ; Sripada et\u00a0al.,  ; Koch et\u00a0al.,  ; Miller et\u00a0al.,  ; DiGangi et\u00a0al.,  ). During working memory tasks that require executive functioning, enhanced connectivity of the PCC with other DMN areas has also been reported among individuals with PTSD as compared to increased central executive network (CEN) and salience network (SN) connectivity among healthy individuals (Daniels et\u00a0al.,  ). With respect to executive functioning tasks in PTSD, suboptimal downregulation of DMN regions may underscore difficulties in disengaging from internally focused self\u2010referential processing in order to attend to external cognitive demands (Aupperle et\u00a0al.,  ). Notably, the DMN also exhibits altered activation patterns during threatful\u2010 and trauma\u2010related conditions in PTSD. Indeed, a recent meta\u2010analysis has shown that both reexperiencing and retrieval of trauma\u2010related autobiographical memories are associated with enhanced activation within the PCC and other DMN regions among individuals with PTSD as compared to healthy controls (Thome et\u00a0al.,  ). Meta\u2010analytic results reported elsewhere also suggest that traumatic imagery tasks uniquely induce activation in the PCC, with coactivation of the precuneus, relative to healthy controls (Ramage et\u00a0al.,  ). Similarly, the presentation of trauma\u2010versus\u2010neutral words has been shown to increase activation in the PCC, the mPFC, the midbrain, and the bed\u2010nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), with concomitant decreases in activation within dlPFC emotion regulation areas in PTSD as compared to healthy controls (Awasthi et\u00a0al.,  ). This is supported by years of experimental work in the field linking these neural correlates with PTSD symptoms during both script\u2010driven imagery and the recall of trauma\u2010related autobiographical memories in PTSD (Hopper et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ; Frewen et\u00a0al.,  ; Mickleborough et\u00a0al.,  ; Ramage et\u00a0al.,  ; Liberzon & Abelson,  ; Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ; Thome et\u00a0al.,  ). As such, during trauma\u2010related stimulus exposure, it has been suggested that enhanced DMN recruitment in PTSD may coincide with self\u2010related processes that are seemingly fused with experiences of trauma, indeed reflecting the self\u2010coupled nature of the disorder (Terpou et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ). Furthermore, the PCC has been shown to be hyperactive in PTSD during emotion\u2010processing tasks in comparison to healthy individuals, where critically, longitudinal improvements in PTSD symptoms in response to trauma\u2010focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have been found to be associated with decreased PCC activation in youth with PTSD (Garrett et\u00a0al.,  ). Taken together, regulating the PCC and the DMN may represent a critical avenue to explore with respect to neurobiologically informed treatment interventions for PTSD (Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ; Akiki et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nIn support of this, previous studies in PTSD using electroencephalography neurofeedback (EEG\u2010NFB), including a randomized controlled trial by our group (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ), have examined the regulation of brain oscillations tied to the PCC and DMN (Kluetsch et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). Notably, one session of EEG\u2010NFB has been shown to lead to acute decreases in arousal symptoms among individuals with PTSD, which has been associated with a normalization of both DMN and amygdala resting\u2010state functional connectivity (Kluetsch et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). In these aforementioned EEG\u2010NFB studies, the target of NFB was the desynchronization of alpha rhythms over the PCC. Alpha oscillations are correlated with DMN activation (Mantini et\u00a0al.,  ; Jann et\u00a0al.,  ; Clancy et\u00a0al.,  ), where alpha\u2010rhythm reductions are commonly observed during the resting\u2010state in PTSD over the main hubs of the DMN (PCC and mPFC) (Clancy et\u00a0al.,  ), hypothesized to be related to chronic hyperarousal (Ros et\u00a0al.,  ; Liberzon & Abelson,  ; Abdallah et\u00a0al.,  ; Clancy et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Sitaram et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). Additionally, during a 20\u2010week randomized controlled trial of alpha\u2010desynchronizing EEG\u2010NFB in PTSD (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ), individuals in the experimental group demonstrated significantly reduced PTSD severity scores post\u2010NFB and at the 3\u2010month follow\u2010up, which was associated with a shift towards normalization of DMN resting\u2010state functional connectivity. Specifically, PTSD patients in the experimental group were found to display decreased PCC connectivity with the anterior DMN after NFB treatment (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). It was hypothesized that this may reflect normalized connectivity within over utilized posterior DMN communities consisting of the PCC and precuneus (Akiki et\u00a0al.,  ; Holmes et\u00a0al.,  ) after NFB treatment (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). Notably, PTSD remission rates as well as decreases in PTSD severity scores in the experimental group were comparable to that of current gold\u2010standard treatments for PTSD (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). Collectively, preliminary results from our previous alpha\u2010desynchronizing EEG\u2010NFB studies suggest that feedback signals tied to the DMN, and more specifically the PCC, may represent a viable target for NFB treatment in PTSD. Critically, in comparison to EEG\u2010NFB, rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB allows for increased spatial specificity with respect to precisely targeting areas in the brain and provides increased spatial resolution for examining mechanistic evidence associated with regulation. \n\nRecently, the application of rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB in PTSD has expanded greatly, where previous studies have largely focused on the regulation of the amygdala (Gerin et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Misaki et\u00a0al.,  ,  ,  ; Zotev et\u00a0al.,  ; Chiba et\u00a0al.,  ), a limbic region associated with emotion reactivity and highly implicated in PTSD symptoms (Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ). Nicholson et\u00a0al. ( ) found that downregulating the amygdala in PTSD during trauma triggers increased activity and connectivity of the dlPFC and vlPFC involved in emotion regulation and executive functioning, findings supported by other rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB groups (Misaki et\u00a0al.,  ; Zotev et\u00a0al.,  ). With regard to ICNs, Nicholson et\u00a0al. (2018) also found that downregulating the amygdala with rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB led to increased recruitment of the CEN and stabilized DMN recruitment over NFB training. This represents a critical finding as individuals with PTSD have been shown to maladaptively recruit the DMN instead of the CEN during tasks that require cognitive control (Daniels et\u00a0al.,  ). Of importance, Zotev et\u00a0al. (2018) also showed in a randomized controlled study that amygdala regulation using rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB leads to significantly reduced PTSD severity scores, including significant reductions on avoidance, hyperarousal, and depressive symptoms. Extending the amygdala rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB literature, machine learning classifiers have also been utilized to improve performance on emotional conflict tasks by differentially selecting for brain states associated with targets as compared to trauma distractors (Weaver et\u00a0al.,  ). Additionally, upregulating anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity has also been utilized in PTSD as a means to improve implicit emotion regulation capacities (Zweerings et\u00a0al.,  ). Taken together, these results suggest that regulating specific brain areas tied to the manifestation of PTSD symptoms (e.g., the PCC of the DMN) may result in clinically meaningful changes, where additional studies are urgently needed to explore novel neurofeedback targets in PTSD. \n\n### Current study \n  \nHere, we utilized rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB to train PCC downregulation during emotion induction paradigms (presentation of trauma\u2010related/distressing words) among individuals with PTSD and healthy controls. The rationale of the current study to downregulate the PCC was threefold: (1) the PCC is highly associated with PTSD symptomatology which together with other DMN areas, displays hyperactivity when trauma memories become activated (Frewen et\u00a0al.,  ; Thome et\u00a0al.,  ); (2) regulating neural signals related to the PCC/DMN using EEG\u2010NFB has shown promising preliminary evidence in a randomized controlled trial (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ); and (3) the feasibility of downregulating amygdala activation using rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB in patients with PTSD has been demonstrated, which resulted in a shift toward normalization of DMN connectivity and reduced PTSD severity scores (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Zotev et\u00a0al.,  ). Given the dynamic interplay between intrinsic brain networks (Menon,  ), we hypothesized that PCC downregulation would lead to concomitant alterations in activation among regions within the DMN (e.g., mPFC), SN, and CEN (e.g., dlPFC involved in emotion regulation). We further predicted that NFB training would lead to decreased state PTSD/emotional symptoms. Moreover, given the well\u2010documented differences between PTSD and healthy controls with respect to DMN recruitment during both emotion induction paradigms and executive functioning tasks, we hypothesized unique neural mechanisms associated with regulation (i.e., psychopathological specificity) and predicted that machine learning models would be able to accurately classify PTSD versus healthy controls during NFB training. \n\n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nOur neuroimaging sample consisted of   n  \u00a0= 30 individuals [  n  \u00a0= 15 patients with a primary diagnosis of PTSD and   n  \u00a0= 15 healthy participants (see Table\u00a0  for demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample)]. The sample size of this preliminary investigation was based on study feasibility during the time of recruitment. One participant in the PTSD group was excluded from the analyses since they reported having fallen asleep in the scanner during the transfer run, thus leaving the final sample size   n  \u00a0= 14 in the PTSD group and   n  \u00a0= 15 in the healthy control group. No individual had previously received NFB, and there was no sample overlap with our previous NFB investigations (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). There were nonsignificant differences with respect to biological sex between the PTSD and healthy control groups. However, the mean age of participants in the PTSD group was significantly higher as compared to the healthy control group. Importantly, when age was included as a covariate within the analyses described below, our neural activation results were not significantly affected. Participants were recruited from 2017 to 2019 through referrals from family physicians, mental health professionals, psychology/psychiatric clinics, community programs for traumatic stress, and posters/advertisements within the London, Ontario community. \n  \nDemographic and clinical information \n    \nThe inclusion criteria for PTSD participants included a primary diagnosis of PTSD as determined using the Clinician\u2010Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS\u20105) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM\u20105 (SCID) (First et\u00a0al.,  ; Weathers et\u00a0al.,  ). Patients with PTSD currently receiving psychotropic medication were on a stable dose for 1 month prior to their participation in the NFB study. Exclusion criteria for PTSD patients included alcohol or substance use disorder not in sustained full remission within the last 3 months prior to scanning and a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar or psychotic disorders. PTSD patients were also excluded from the study if they had prominent current suicidal ideation within the past 3 months or self\u2010injurious behaviours in the last 3 months requiring medical attention. Exclusion criteria for the healthy control group included lifetime psychiatric illness and current use of any psychotropic medications. Exclusion criteria for all participants included past or current biofeedback treatment, noncompliance with 3 Tesla fMRI safety standards, significant untreated medical illness, pregnancy, a history of neurological or pervasive developmental disorders, and previous head injury with loss of consciousness. Please see the supplementary materials section (Table  ) for a detailed report on the history of trauma exposure in each group. \n\nParticipants completed a battery of assessments before the NFB experiment, which consisted of the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck et\u00a0al.,  ), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (Bernstein et\u00a0al.,  ), and the Multiscale Dissociation Inventory (MDI) (Briere,  ). In addition, in order to assess state changes in emotion\u2010related symptoms during NFB, participants completed the Response to Script Driven Imagery (RSDI) Scale (Hopper et\u00a0al.,  ) after each of the 4 fMRI runs, which consisted of the following symptom subscales: reliving, distress, physical reactions, dissociation, and numbing. All scanning took place at the Lawson Health Research Institute in London, Ontario, Canada. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at Western University, Canada, where participants gave written and informed consent and received financial compensation for participating in the study. \n\n\n### Neurofeedback paradigm \n  \nWe implemented an experimental protocol and paradigm that was identical to our previous NFB investigations (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ); however, we trained individuals to downregulate the PCC as opposed to the amygdala (Figure\u00a0 ). Participants were instructed that they would be   \u201cregulating an area of the brain related to emotional experience  ,\u201d that is, to decrease activation within the PCC. In order to elicit unbiased and personalized regulatory strategies, specific instruction on how to regulate the brain region\u2010of\u2010interest was not provided (Paret et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Zaehringer et\u00a0al.,  ). During training trials, feedback of PCC activation was displayed to participants in the form of two identical thermometers on the left and right side of a screen projected inside the scanner. The bars on the thermometer increased/decreased as BOLD signal in the PCC target fluctuated, where an orange line on the thermometer indicated baseline PCC activation (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nSchematic of the real\u2010time fMRI neurofeedback set\u2010up. Brain activity in the neurofeedback target region (posterior cingulate cortex) was processed in real\u2010time and presented to participants in the fMRI scanner as thermometers that increased or decreased as activation fluctuated. Participants completed three neurofeedback training runs and a transfer run without neurofeedback signal. Figure created with BioRender.com. \n  \nOur neurofeedback protocol consisted of three conditions: (i)   regulate  , (ii)   view  , and (iii)   neutral  . During the   regulate   condition (Figure\u00a0 ), individuals were asked to decrease activity in the brain target (decrease the bars on the thermometer corresponding to PCC activation) while viewing either personalized trauma\u2010related words for the PTSD group or a matched stressful word for the healthy control group (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). During the   view   condition, individuals were asked to respond naturally to their personalized trauma/stressful words while not attempting to regulate the target brain area.   Neutral   trials consisted of asking individuals to respond naturally to personalized neutral words for both groups. Personalized trauma/stressful words (  n  \u00a0= 10) and neutral words (  n  \u00a0= 10) were selected by participants with a trauma\u2010informed clinician and matched on subjective units of distress to control for between subject/group variability. The personalized trauma words selected by participants with PTSD were related to individual experiences of trauma. Furthermore, personalized stressful words selected by healthy controls were related to the individual's most stressful life event. Stimuli were presented with Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Berkeley, CA). Participants were first provided with written instructions, followed by a single example trial within the scanner. Our experimental design then consisted of three consecutive neurofeedback training runs, which was followed by one transfer run in which individuals were presented with the same three conditions but without neurofeedback from the thermometer. Instructions were presented for 2 s before each condition; individual conditions lasted for 24 s and were followed by a 10 s implicit resting state where participants viewed a fixation cross (Figure\u00a0 ). An experimental run lasted about 9 min and consisted of 15 trials (5 of each condition, counterbalanced and separated by an intertrial fixation cross) (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). \n  \nNeurofeedback experimental procedure for the regulate condition. The same timing was utilized for (i) view conditions in which participants viewed trauma\u2010related/distressing words while not attempting to regulate and (ii) for neutral conditions in which participants viewed neutral words and did not attempt to regulate. A trial started with a 2 s instruction slide indicating trial type (i.e., regulate, view, neutral). In the following block, participants saw either a trauma\u2010related/distressing word or a neutral word with a thermometer at both sides. The thermometer displayed the change in brain activation and was updated every 2 s. \n  \nOne bar on the thermometer display corresponded to 0.2% signal change in the PCC, consisting of an upper activation range with a maximum of 2.8% signal change and a lower activation range with a maximum of 1.2% signal change (Paret et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). Participants were instructed to visually focus on the word during its entire presentation and to view the two thermometers in their peripheral vision. Emotion\u2010induction effects of personalized stimuli were confirmed both on the subjective experience level via inspection of RSDI scores and on the neurobiological level by contrasting   view   as compared to   neutral   conditions (see results section below). Participants were also informed of the temporal delay that would occur during neurofeedback, corresponding to both the BOLD signal delay and real\u2010time processing of this neural activation. Finally, when a neurofeedback run was completed, individuals were asked to rate their perceived ability to regulate the target brain area. Specifically, we asked participants to rate the extent to which they were able to gain control over the neurofeedback signal, which ranged from 0 (not at all) to 6 (a great deal). \n\n\n### Real\u2010time signal processing for neurofeedback \n  \nAnatomical scans were first imported into BrainVoyager (Brain Innovations, Maastrict, the Netherlands), skull\u2010stripped, and then transformed into Talairach space. Normalization parameters were then loaded into TurboBrainVoyager (TBV) (Brain Innovations, Maastricht, the Netherlands). Motion correction features and spatial smoothing using a 4\u2010mm full\u2010width\u2010half\u2010maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel were implemented in TBV, and the initial 2 volumes of the functional scans were discarded before real\u2010time processing. We defined the target PCC using a 6 mm sphere over the following coordinate (MNI: 0 \u201050 20) (Bluhm et\u00a0al.,  ). We used the \u201cbest voxel selection\u201d tool in TBV to calculate the BOLD signal amplitude in the PCC. This tool identifies the 33% most active voxels for the   view   >   neutral   contrast. Further details on dynamic ROI definitions can be found in our previous publications (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). The first two trials of each neurofeedback run consisted of   view   and   neutral   conditions thereby allowing for initial selection of PCC voxels based on the   view   >   neutral   contrast, which was dynamically updated as voxels selection was refined along the course of training. For each trial, the mean of the last 4 data points before stimuli onset (during the implicit resting state) were selected as a baseline and indicated to participants as an orange line on the thermometer display. The signal was smoothed by calculating the mean of the current and the preceding 3 data points (Paret et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\n\n### fMRI image acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nNeuroimaging was conducted using a 3 Tesla MRI Scanner at the Lawson Health Research Institute (Siemens Biograph mMR, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32\u2010channel head coil, where during scanning participants\u2019 heads were stabilized. Functional whole brain images of the BOLD contrast were acquired with a gradient echo T2*\u2010weighted echo\u2010planar\u2010imaging sequence (TE\u00a0= 30 ms, TR\u00a0= 2 s, FOV\u00a0= 192\u00a0\u00d7 192 mm, flip angle\u00a0= 80\u00b0, inplane resolution\u00a0= 3\u00a0\u00d7 3 mm). One volume comprised 36 ascending interleaved slices tilted \u221220\u00b0 from AC\u2010PC orientation with a thickness of 3 mm and slice gap of 1 mm. The experimental runs comprised 284 volumes each, where T1\u2010weighted anatomical images were acquired with a Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo sequence (TE\u00a0= 3.03 ms, TR\u00a0= 2.3 s, 192 slices and FOV\u00a0= 256\u00a0\u00d7 256 mm). \n\nPreprocessing of the functional images was performed with SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) within MATLAB R2020a. Our standard preprocessing routine included discarding 4 initial volumes, slice time correction to the middle slice, reorientation to the AC\u2010PC axis, spatial alignment to the mean image using a rigid body transformation, reslicing, and coregistration of the functional mean image to the subject's anatomical image. The coregistered images were segmented using the \u201cNew Segment\u201d method implemented in SPM12. The functional images were normalized to MNI space (Montr\u00e9al Neurological Institute) and were smoothed with a FWHM Gaussian kernel of 6 mm. Additional correction for motion was implemented using the ART software package (Gabrieli Lab, McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Cambridge, MA), which computes regressors that account for outlier volumes. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \n#### First\u2010level analysis \n  \nWe defined separate sessions for each neurofeedback training run and the transfer run, where all events (initial rest, instructions, fixation, and conditions) were modeled as blocks of brain activation and convolved with the hemodynamic response function. In the first level, functional data were also high\u2010pass filtered and serial correlations were accounted for using an autoregressive model. Additionally, ART software regressors were included as nuisance variables to account for any additional movement and outlier artifacts. The three experimental conditions (  regulate, view, and neutral  ) were modeled separately on the first level. \n\n\n#### Second\u2010level analyses \n  \nWe first conducted a split\u2010plot full factorial 2 (group) by 3 (condition) by 3 (NFB training run) ANOVA within SPM12 to investigate changes in whole\u2010brain activation, inputting separate condition specific contrast images generated in the first level. As we were specifically interested in differential activation during the   regulate   and   view   conditions (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ;  ), we examined follow\u2010up comparisons focusing on between condition effects within group, as well as between groups comparing the PTSD and healthy control groups. We then examined the transfer run separately, where we conducted a 2 (group) by 3 (condition) ANOVA and subsequently examined aforementioned direct follow\u2010up comparisons. All analyses were whole\u2010brain corrected for multiple comparisons using a clusterwise false discovery rate (FDR) threshold at   p   < .05,   k  \u00a0= 10, with an initial clustering defining threshold in SPM at   p   < .001,   k  \u00a0= 10 (Eklund et\u00a0al.,  ; Roiser et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nFinally, we conducted linear regression analyses across all subjects, examining potential correlations between trait\u2010based symptoms and whole\u2010brain activation during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions over NFB training runs. Here, we examined PTSD symptom severity scores (CAPS\u20105 total), difficulty in emotion regulation scores (DERS total), and depressive symptoms (BDI total). \n\n\n#### Neurofeedback PCC downregulation analysis \n  \nIn order to evaluate PCC downregulation (neurofeedback success), we extracted the event\u2010related BOLD response (peristimulus time histogram) from the PCC target area during the   regulate   and the   view   conditions using rfxplot software (Gl\u00e4scher,  ), using the same sphere definition that was used to generate feedback for participants in the fMRI scanner. Here, we extracted the event\u2010related BOLD response from individual peaks within the search volume, and these values were\u00a0then passed to SPSS (v.26) for statistical analyses. Within rfxplot software, event\u2010related BOLD responses display the average height of the BOLD responses within a defined volume and time window (Gl\u00e4scher,  ). Rfxplot shows the actual data and does not rely on first\u2010 or second\u2010level models. Event\u2010related BOLD responses are estimated by a condition\u2010specific Finite Impulse Response (FIR) model (Gl\u00e4scher,  ). Here, the condition duration in which the BOLD response is expected to fluctuate is parcellated into temporal bins (TR\u00a0= 2 s) starting at the onset of all trials belonging to a particular condition. The parameter estimate for each bin of the FIR model is identical to the mean BOLD response in that bin, thus creating an event\u2010related BOLD time course for each subject. For the final display (Figure\u00a0 ), rfxplot averages subject\u2010specific event\u2010related BOLD responses based on group. \n  \n(a) Event\u2010related BOLD response in the NFB target area (PCC), during the three training runs in the PTSD and healthy control groups. The red lines indicate PCC activation during the   regulate   condition, where the goal was to decrease activation while viewing trauma/stressful words. The green lines indicate PCC activation during the   view   condition, where participants were not attempting to decrease activation while viewing trauma/stressful words. Here, PCC activation was significantly lower during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions for NFB training runs 1\u20133, for both the PTSD and healthy control groups. (b) Event\u2010related BOLD response in the target area (PCC) during the transfer run when neurofeedback was not provided. Taken together, this demonstrates that both groups were able to gain control over downregulating their PCC with similar success. The   x  \u2010axis of the graphs indicate time over the 24 s conditions; the   y  \u2010axis indicates the event\u2010related BOLD response (peristimulus time histogram) in the target area. Shaded areas of red and green indicate standard error of the mean. Abbreviations: PCC\u00a0= posterior cingulate cortex, NFB\u00a0= neurofeedback. \n  \nFor the PTSD and healthy control groups separately, we computed repeated measures 2 (condition) by 4 (NFB run) ANOVAs. Subsequently, we then conducted a priori defined paired sample   t  \u2010tests, comparing the average BOLD response within the NFB target area between conditions for each NFB run within groups. We also conducted independent samples   t  \u2010tests comparing the average BOLD response within the NFB target area during a single NFB run for a given condition between groups. Lastly, we conducted repeated measures one\u2010way ANOVAs for the regulate condition for each group in order to examine potential learning effects across NFB training. \n\n\n#### State changes in emotional experience over neurofeedback \n  \nWe examined state changes in subjective response to traumatic/stressful stimuli over the NFB training experiment, as measured by RSDI subscales. As collected data were not normally distributed, we computed nonparametric Friedman's repeated measures ANOVAs for each group for each RSDI subscale. Here, we Bonferroni corrected our statistical threshold (  p   < .05/5\u00a0= .01) for nonparametric ANOVAs. Paired comparisons between time points were conducted using nonparametric tests for related samples (Wilcoxon signed\u2010ranks test). We then compared state symptoms across NFB runs between groups with Mann\u2013Whitney U tests. \n\n\n#### Machine learning classification analysis \n  \nWe examined the accuracy of machine learning algorithms in classifying PTSD patients as compared to healthy individuals based on whole brain activation during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions across NFB training runs. Here, we implemented L1\u2010Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) Classification algorithms within PRoNTo toolbox ( ) (Schrouff et\u00a0al.,  ) running under Matlab2020a (Mathworks, 2020). This approach has two potential benefits: (1) it can lead to improved overall generalization performance and (2) it can identify a sparse subset of relevant brain regions for the predictive model. Predictors consisted of contrast images corresponding to the   view   as compared to the   regulate   condition, where each NFB training run was inputted as a separate modality during design specification. A feature set was then prepared; NFB runs were concatenated and separate kernels were built for each modality and for each anatomical region defined by the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL, Tzourio\u2010 Mazoyer et\u00a0al., 2002) atlas. Here, an L1\u2010MKL Classifier (Schrouff et\u00a0al.,  ) was used to test if neural activation during   view   as compared to   regulate   could accurately predict group membership classification of PTSD versus healthy control. Critically, PRoNTo software implements kernel methods as a result of the high dimensionality of pattern vectors in neuroimaging data relative to the number of subjects (for more information see Schrouff et\u00a0al.,  ). We used a leave\u2010one\u2010subject\u2010out (LOSO) cross\u2010validation procedure to estimate the generalizability of our classifiers, where features were mean\u2010centered and normalized. Statistical significance of classification accuracy measures was determined via permutation testing (20,000 permutations). We then used anatomical/functional information from the AAL atlas to learn the contribution of each brain region to decision function of the machine, a function afforded by the grouping structure and the implementation of a spare version of Multiple Kernel Learning within PRoNTo toolbox (Schrouff et\u00a0al.  ). \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### PCC downregulation with neurofeedback \n  \nWe found that both patients with PTSD and healthy individuals were able to significantly downregulate their PCC during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions (Figure  ). \n\nIn summary, the average event\u2010related BOLD response within the PCC (NFB target area) was significantly lower during the   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions for all three NFB training runs (see Figure\u00a0 ), as well as for the transfer run (see Figure\u00a0 ) in both the PTSD and healthy control group, where activation during   regulate   did not differ significantly when comparing NFB runs directly. \n\nSpecifically, our 2 (condition) by 4 (NFB run) repeated measures ANOVAs yielded significant main effects of condition for analyses conducted within the PTSD group (  F  (1, 13)\u00a0= 37.6,   p   < .0001, \u03b7 \u00a0= .743) and within the control group (  F  (1, 14)\u00a0= 33.67,   p   < .0001, \u03b7 \u00a0= .706). We found nonsignificant main effects of NFB run and nonsignificant interactions for both groups. Next, follow\u2010up paired sample   t  \u2010tests demonstrated that the average event\u2010related BOLD response during the   regulate   condition was significantly lower than the   view   condition for all NFB training runs and the transfer run, for both the PTSD group (NFB run 1:   t  (13)\u00a0= \u22123.50,   p  \u00a0= .004; NFB run 2:   t  (13)\u00a0= \u22123.00,   p  \u00a0= .011; NFB run 3:   t  (13)\u00a0= \u22123.71,   p  \u00a0= .003; transfer run:   t  (13)\u00a0= \u22123.50,   p  \u00a0= .004) and the healthy control group (NFB run 1:   t  (14)\u00a0= \u22123.63,   p  \u00a0= .003; NFB run 2:   t  (14)\u00a0= \u22125.43,   p   < .0001; NFB run 3:   t  (14)\u00a0= \u22125.77,   p   < .0001; transfer run:   t  (14)\u00a0= \u22123.21,   p  \u00a0= .006). Interestingly, when comparing each condition during a respective NFB run and during the transfer run between groups, we found nonsignificant differences in the average event\u2010related BOLD response during the   regulate   and   view   conditions between PTSD and healthy control groups. When conducting the same analysis but investigating the difference in BOLD response between the   regulate   and   view   conditions between PTSD and healthy control groups, we also found nonsignificant differences between groups. Indeed, this implies that both experimental groups were able to gain control over downregulating their PCC with similar success. However, as demonstrated below, the neural mechanisms by which the regulation was achieved is starkly different. Finally, when examining repeated measures one\u2010way ANOVAS for   regulate   trials over the NFB runs, we report nonsignificant main effects of run for both the PTSD and healthy control groups. Please see the supplementary materials section (Figure  ) for plots of the event\u2010related BOLD response within the PCC NFB target region during all conditions (  neutral  ,   view  , and   regulate  ). \n\nWhen evaluating perceived ability to regulate the neurofeedback signal, our 2 (group) by 4 (run) split\u2010plot repeated measured ANOVA revealed a nonsignificant group by run interaction, where the PTSD and healthy control groups did not differ significantly when comparing each run directly (PTSD:   M  \u00a0= 2.5,   SD   \u00b11.42; healthy control group:   M  \u00a0= 2.83,   SD   \u00b11.21; perceived ability to regulate scale 0\u00a0= not at all, 6\u00a0= a great deal). Additionally, within\u2010group comparisons of subjective ratings on ability to regulate the neurofeedback signal at run 1 versus run 4 were found to be nonsignificant. \n\n\n### Differential mechanisms of PCC downregulation: Neural activation analysis \n  \nOur split\u2010plot ANOVA revealed a significant group by condition by NFB run interaction within the right dlPFC (see Table\u00a0 ). This fortified the examination of our subsequent a priori planned comparisons. Here, we focused on investigation around the difference between the   regulate   and   view   conditions. Importantly, however, when examining neural activation during   view   as compared to   neutral   conditions across all participants, we found significant activation within the PCC/precuneus (NFB target area), the left anterior insula, the bilateral cerebellum (lobule VI and Crus I/II), the left dmPFC, and the left angular gyrus (see supplemental material Table  ). These findings confirm increased neural activation within the NFB target region (PCC) as a result of the emotion induction paradigm and provide construct validity to the current investigation in both the PTSD and healthy control groups. \n  \n2 (Group)\u00a0\u00d7 3 (condition)\u00a0\u00d7 3 (NFB Run) split plot ANOVA \n    \nWhen examining NFB training runs within groups, during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions, the PTSD group showed expected decreases in the PCC/precuneus target area, as well as concomitant decreases in the bilateral dmPFC, the left postcentral gyrus, the right temporal pole, the mid\u2010cingulate cortex, the left amygdala/hippocampus, and the right superior temporal gyrus (see Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). When analyzing NFB training runs during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions, the healthy control group also showed expected decreases in the PCC/precuneus target area, in addition to concomitant decreases in the bilateral postcentral gyrus, the right middle temporal gyrus, and the left superior temporal gyrus (see Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). Additionally, the healthy control group exhibited increased activation during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions within the right dlPFC. Interestingly, direct group comparisons revealed that the healthy control group displayed increased right dlPFC activation relative to the PTSD group during   regulate   conditions as compared to   view   conditions (see Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nNeurofeedback training direct comparisons \n      \nNeural dynamics during NFB training of PCC downregulation.

Abbreviations: PCC\u00a0= posterior cingulate cortex, dmPFC\u00a0= dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. \n    \n(a) Neural dynamics during NFB training of PCC downregulation. Brain areas that show concomitant decreases (blue) and increases (red) in activity during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions across NFB training runs in the healthy control group. (b) Direct group comparisons revealed that the healthy control group displayed increased right dlPFC activation relative to the PTSD group, during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions over NFB training. (c) Illustration of brain areas that show concomitant decreases (blue) in activity during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions during the transfer run without neurofeedback in the healthy control group. Results evaluated at the FDR\u2010cluster corrected level for multiple comparisons (  p   < .05,   k  \u00a0= 10). Abbreviations: NFB\u00a0= neurofeedback, PCC\u00a0= posterior cingulate cortex, dlPFC\u00a0= dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. \n  \nWhen examining neural activation during the transfer run within group, during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions, the healthy control group displayed decreased precuneus/PCC and right postcentral gyrus activation (see Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). During the transfer run, we found nonsignificant differences between the   regulate   and   view   conditions within the PTSD group and when comparing these conditions in the transfer run between the PTSD and healthy control groups at a conservative FDR\u2010corrected threshold. Notably, when age was included as covariate, the aformentioned neural activation results were not significantly affected. \n  \nTransfer run direct comparisons \n    \n\n### Clinical correlations with neural activation \n  \nWhen evaluating associations between neural activation and clinical measures with linear regression analyses, we found that PTSD severity scores (CAPS total) positively correlated with left anterior insula and right cerebellum (lobule VI/Crus I) activation during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions (see Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). In other words, the higher the PTSD symptoms, the more the left anterior insula and the right cerebellum (lobule VI/Crus I) was activated during the viewing of trauma/stressful words as compared to regulating the PCC while viewing these words. Additionally, PTSD severity scores (CAPS total) negatively correlated to activation in the right dlPFC during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions. Hence, the more the dlPFC was activated during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions, the less severe the PTSD symptoms. Considering significant correlations observed with CAPS\u2010total scores, we then conducted follow\u2010up post hoc linear regression analyses with scores related to the severity of intrusion symptoms (CAPS\u20105 cluster B), severity of negative alterations in cognitions and mood (CAPS\u20105 cluster D), and severity of arousal and reactivity symptoms (CAPS\u20105 cluster E). Here, similar positive correlations were found with the bilateral anterior insula and the right cerebellum (lobule VI/Crus I) during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions, as well as negative correlations with right dlPFC activation during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions. \n  \nNeurofeedback training multiple regression analysis \n      \nThe upper portion of the figure shows correlations between PTSD severity scores (CAPS total) and brain activation during NFB training. The lower portion of the figure illustrates correlations between difficulties in emotion regulation (DERS total) and brain activation during NFB training. Red clusters indicate positive correlations during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions. Blue clusters indicate negative correlations during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions. During NFB training, the more severe the PTSD symptoms, the more the left anterior insula and the right cerebellum (lobule VI/Crus I) was activated during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions. Additionally, the more the dlPFC was activated during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions over NFB training, the less severe the PTSD symptoms. Furthermore, the more difficult it was for participants to regulate their emotions, the more the anterior insula was activated during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions. Finally, the more dlPFC activation during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions over NFB training, the less difficulties participants had with emotion regulation. Results evaluated at the FDR\u2010cluster corrected level for multiple comparisons (  p   < .05,   k  \u00a0= 10). NFB\u00a0= neurofeedback, dlPFC\u00a0= dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. \n  \nAdditionally, we found a positive correlation between difficulty in emotion regulation scores (DERS total) and the right anterior insula during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions (see Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). In other words, the more difficult it was for participants to regulate their emotions, the more the anterior insula was activated during the viewing of trauma/stressful words as compared to regulating the PCC while viewing these words. Furthermore, difficulty in emotion regulation was negatively correlated to right dlPFC activation during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions. Indeed, the more dlPFC activation during   regulate  , the less difficulties participants had in emotion regulation. \n\n\n### State changes in emotional experience over neurofeedback \n  \nIn summary, when examining state changes in emotional experience over NFB training in response to trauma/stressful stimuli presentation, we found that the PTSD and healthy control groups demonstrated significant reductions in reliving symptoms, where additionally, the PTSD group demonstrated significant reductions on distress symptoms as measured by the RSDI Scale (see Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nWhen examining state changes in emotional experience over NFB training in response to trauma/stressful stimuli presentation, we found that the PTSD and healthy control groups demonstrated significant reductions on reliving symptoms, where additionally, the PTSD group demonstrated significant reductions on distress symptoms as measured by the RSDI Scale. Abbreviations: NFB\u00a0= neurofeedback, RSDI\u00a0= Response to Script Driven Imagery Scale. \n  \nSpecifically, the PTSD group showed a significant main effect of run for the nonparametric ANOVA examining symptoms of reliving (  \u03c7  (3)\u00a0= 11.49,\u00a0  p  \u00a0= .009). Follow\u2010up Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank tests revealed that NFB run 3 had lower scores of reliving than NFB run 1 (  p  \u00a0= .016). Similarly, the control group demonstrated a significant main effect of run examining symptoms of reliving (  \u03c7  (3)\u00a0= 18.24,   p   < .0001). Follow\u2010up tests revealed that NFB runs 3 (  p =   .008) and 4 (  p =   .010) had significantly lower scores of reliving than NFB run 1. Finally, the PTSD group also displayed a significant main effect of run for symptoms of distress (  \u03c7  (3)\u00a0= 13.79,\u00a0  p =   .003). Follow\u2010up tests showed that distress symptoms during NFB run 3 (  p =   .010) and 4 (  p =   .013) were significantly lower than NFB run 1. Symptoms of physical reactions, dissociation and numbing did not significantly decrease over NFB runs. Furthermore, as expected, when comparing state symptoms across NFB runs between groups with Mann\u2013Whitney U tests, the PTSD group always demonstrated higher levels of symptoms as compared to the healthy control group, even for symptoms of distress and reliving which decreased significantly over NFB runs for the PTSD group. \n\n\n### Machine learning classification analysis \n  \nSupporting differential mechanisms associated with PCC downregulation in PTSD versus healthy individuals (i.e., psychopathological specificity), machine learning algorithms were able to classify participants based on NFB brain activation during the   view   as compared to   regulate   condition during training runs with 80% accuracy (ROC\u00a0= 0.85,   p  \u00a0< .001 permutation testing). The class predictive value was 83.33% for the PTSD group and 76.47% for the healthy control group. Additionally, the class accuracy was 71.43% for the PTSD group and 86.67% for the healthy control group. The highest\u2010ranking ROIs used by the decision function of the machine were bilateral the dlPFC, the bilateral dmPFC, the bilateral vmPFC, and the PCC, which provides converging evidence of our univariate between group results. Here, the MKL models were indeed quite sparse, with nine regions having a nonnull contribution across folds. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn summary, we found that both the PTSD and healthy control groups were able to downregulate their PCC with similar success in terms of average event\u2010related BOLD response within the NFB target area, which remained stable over NFB training and into the post\u2010training transfer run. With regard to state changes in emotional experience over NFB training, both the PTSD and healthy control groups demonstrated reduced reliving symptoms in response to trauma/stressful stimuli. Additionally, the PTSD group demonstrated significantly reduced distress symptoms over NFB training and into the post\u2010training transfer run. Interestingly, PCC NFB training was concomitantly associated with unique within\u2010group downregulation of activity (  regulate < view  ) within the dorsomedial PFC, postcentral gyrus, amygdala/hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and temporal pole/gyri. Interestingly, downregulating the PCC during NFB training was associated with greater activation (  regulate > view)   in the right dlPFC among healthy individuals as compared to those with PTSD. In support of this, increased activation in the right dlPFC during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions was negatively correlated to PTSD symptom severity scores and difficulties in emotion regulation. Furthermore, stronger activation in the anterior insula and cerebellum (lobule VI/crus I) during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions was positively associated with PTSD symptoms. \n\nSupporting differential mechanisms associated with PCC downregulation in PTSD versus healthy individuals, machine learning models were able to classify participants based on brain activation during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions   during NFB training runs   with 80% accuracy. Here, the highest\u2010ranking ROIs used by the decision function of the machine were the bilateral dlPFC, the bilateral dmPFC, the bilateral vmPFC, and the PCC, which provides converging evidence of our univariate between group results. \n\n### PCC neurofeedback decreased reliving and distress symptoms \n  \nWithin both the PTSD and healthy control groups, the BOLD response within the PCC search volume (NFB target area) was found to be significantly lower during the   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions for all three NFB training runs and the transfer run, where PCC activation during   regulate   did not differ significantly when comparing NFB runs. Direct comparisons of regulation success did not yield significant between group differences, suggesting that PTSD and healthy individuals can similarly gain control over this brain region via rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB. Further demonstrating the strength of the current results, at the whole\u2010brain FDR\u2010corrected level, both groups showed decreased activation within clusters spanning the PCC/precuneus during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions over NFB\u2010training. Interestingly, these whole\u2010brain results extended to the transfer run only for the healthy control group, where additional training sessions/statistical power may be required to observe this transfer run effect in the PTSD group at our conservative statistical threshold (FDR   p   <.05). The PCC and precuneus are major hubs of the DMN, where DMN functional disruptions in PTSD are associated with traumatic/negative autobiographical memories, distorted and dysregulated self\u2010referential processing, and alterations in social cognition (Bluhm et\u00a0al.,  ; Daniels et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Tursich et\u00a0al.,  ; Akiki et\u00a0al.,  ; Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ; Hinojosa et\u00a0al.,  ; Frewen et\u00a0al.,  ; Terpou et\u00a0al.,  ). Indeed, traumatic imagery tasks in PTSD have been found to induce hyperactivation in the PCC (Awasthi et\u00a0al.,  ) and in the precuneus (Ramage et\u00a0al.,  ), where it has been suggested that suboptimal downregulation of the PCC and DMN may underscore difficulties in disengaging from internally focused self\u2010referential processing (Aupperle et\u00a0al.,  ). A recent meta\u2010analysis has also found that both reexperiencing and retrieval of trauma\u2010related autobiographical memories are associated with enhanced activation within the PCC and other DMN regions among individuals with PTSD (Thome et\u00a0al.,  ). In line with these findings, we found increased PCC activation during   view   as compared to   neutral   conditions in the current study. Notably, NFB training of PCC downregulation resulted in concomitant decreases in reliving symptoms among those with PTSD and healthy individuals, with additional decreases in distress symptoms in the PTSD group. As expected, between\u2010group comparisons revealed that reliving and distress symptoms were higher in the PTSD group as compared to the healthy control group. In support of associations between PCC downregulation and reductions in symptoms, longitudinal improvements in PTSD symptoms in response to trauma\u2010focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have been found to be associated with decreased PCC activation in youth with PTSD during emotion\u2010processing tasks (Garrett et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nConsistent with the current results, one session of alpha rhythm EEG\u2010NFB has been shown previously to lead to acute decreases in arousal symptoms among PTSD patients and normalize both DMN and amygdala resting\u2010state functional connectivity patterns (Kluetsch et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). Additionally, during a 20\u2010week randomized controlled trial of alpha\u2010based EEG\u2010NFB in PTSD (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ), individuals in the experimental group demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions on PTSD severity scores post\u2010NFB and at 3\u2010month follow\u2010up, which were associated with a shift towards normalization of DMN resting\u2010state functional connectivity. \n\n\n### NFB\u2010induced whole\u2010brain regulation and correlations with symptoms \n  \nWhen examining whole\u2010brain BOLD response during PCC NFB training runs, with respect to   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions, the   PTSD group   showed decreased activity in the bilateral dmPFC, the mid\u2010cingulate cortex, and the left amygdala/hippocampus. Previously, the presentation of trauma\u2010versus\u2010neutral words has been shown to be related to increased activation within the DMN (the PCC and mPFC) and the SN (the PAG and BNST), as compared to decreased activation in the CEN involved in emotion regulation (the dlPFC) when comparing PTSD and healthy controls (Awasthi et\u00a0al.,  ). In the same study, PTSD symptom severity was positively correlated with neural activation during trauma\u2010versus\u2010neutral words within the DMN (the PCC and hippocampus) and the SN (the amygdala and BNST) and negatively correlated with CEN activation (the dlPFC). This is supported by previous research examining PTSD brain correlates during both script\u2010driven imagery and the recall of trauma\u2010related autobiographical memories in PTSD (Hopper et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ; Frewen et\u00a0al.,  ; Mickleborough et\u00a0al.,  ; Ramage et\u00a0al.,  ; Liberzon and Abelson,  ; Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ; Thome et\u00a0al.,  ). Interestingly, in the current study, we found evidence to suggest that downregulating the PCC during trauma word presentation resulted in a normalization of this PTSD neural signature, with decreased activation in aforementioned DMN regions involved in self\u2010related and autobiographical memory processing (bilateral dmPFC and hippocampus) as well as in SN areas involved in emotional arousal, emotion evaluation, salience monitoring and innate fight\u2010or\u2010flight defensive responses (amygdala and mid\u2010cingulate cortex) (Liddell et\u00a0al.,  ; Etkin et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  , 2017; Fitzgerald et\u00a0al.,  ; Hinojosa et\u00a0al.,  ). Activation in the dmPFC occurs during self\u2010related emotion processing and exposure to negative content, and additionally, is involved in evaluating self\u2010related emotional experience (Fitzgerald et\u00a0al.,  ). Moreover, the dmPFC has been shown generally to subserve functions related to the appraisal and expression of fear and anxiety (Etkin et\u00a0al.,  ). Recent meta\u2010analyses have also reported that the mid\u2010cingulate cortex is hyperactive in PTSD, with both correlations to PTSD severity and trauma exposure (Hayes et\u00a0al.,  ; Patel et\u00a0al.,  ; Hinojosa et\u00a0al.,  ). Furthermore, several studies have found evidence of enhanced hippocampal engagement during exposure to trauma\u2010specific images, as well as increased activation during reexperiencing and retrieval of trauma\u2010related autobiographical memories (Hou et\u00a0al.,  ; Nilsen et\u00a0al.,  ; Fitzgerald et\u00a0al.,  ; Thome et\u00a0al.,  ). With respect to the amygdala, due to its hyperactivity in close association with symptoms of PTSD and hyperarousal (Hayes et\u00a0al.,  ; Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ; Fitzgerald et\u00a0al.,  ; Henigsberg et\u00a0al.,  ) and its involvement with the innate alarm system in the salient detection of threat (Liddell et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ), this limbic region has been a frequent target of previous rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB studies in PTSD (Gerin et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Misaki et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Zotev et\u00a0al.,  ; Chiba et\u00a0al.,  ). Indeed, it has been shown recently that high treatment response among PTSD patients is characterized by less amygdala\u2010PCC connectivity at rest (Sheynin et\u00a0al.,  ). Taken together, results from the current study suggest that regulating the PCC not only results in gaining control over other DMN structures (dmPFC, hippocampus) but also results in the downregulation of SN structures (amygdala, mid\u2010cingulate) that have been shown previously to be hyperactive and tied to PTSD symptoms during trauma\u2010provocation. \n\nBetween\u2010group comparisons revealed increased right dlPFC activation in the healthy control group relative to the PTSD group during   regulate   conditions as compared to   view   conditions. In support of this, increased activation in the right dlPFC during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions was negatively correlated to global PTSD symptom severity scores (as well as intrusion, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and arousal symptom clusters) and difficulties in emotion regulation. In other words, the more dlPFC activation during   regulate   conditions, the less PTSD symptoms and less difficulties in emotion regulation. As mentioned previously, recent studies have shown decreased dlPFC activation in PTSD during the presentation of trauma\u2010versus\u2010neutral words as compared to healthy controls (Awasthi et\u00a0al.,  ), where hypoactivation within this region has been commonly associated with PTSD symptoms (Pitman et\u00a0al.,  ; Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ; Fitzgerald et\u00a0al.,  ; Holmes et\u00a0al.,  ). Critically, we have shown previously that amygdala downregulation training with rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB leads to both increased dlPFC activation and increased recruitment of the CEN during emotion induction paradigms (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). Zotev et\u00a0al. (2018) showed that 3\u2010sessions of amygdala training with rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB lead to reductions in PTSD severity that correlated with enhanced functional connectivity between the amygdala and dlPFC. In the same data set, a connectome\u2010wide investigation revealed that increased resting\u2010state connectivity between the left dlPFC and the precuneus was correlated with PTSD symptom reductions in hyperarousal after the three NFB training sessions (Misaki et\u00a0al.,  ). Indeed, future studies are warranted to investigate if multiple sessions of PCC downregulation with rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB would also result in increased dlPFC recruitment among individuals with PTSD and if this neural response mediates PTSD symptoms. \n\nIn addition to dlPFC activation being negatively correlated with PTSD symptoms, our results also revealed that activation in the anterior insula during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions was positively associated with global PTSD symptom severity scores (as well as negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and arousal symptom clusters) and difficulties in emotion regulation. Previously, the anterior insula has been shown to be hyperactive in PTSD with positive correlations to symptoms of reexperiencing; in addition, this area also displays aberrant functional connectivity patterns during the resting\u2010state in PTSD (Hopper et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ; Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ; Harricharan et\u00a0al.,  ). It has been suggested that increased anterior insula activity may coincide with enhanced salience processing of environmental cues and PTSD symptoms of hypervigilance, hyperarousal, and reexperiencing (Hopper et\u00a0al.,  ; Patel et\u00a0al.,  ; Koch et\u00a0al.,  ; Akiki et\u00a0al.,  ). Our recent randomized clinical trial of alpha rhythm EEG\u2010NFB over 20 weeks also revealed decreased anterior insula connectivity with the salience network after NFB intervention (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). In support of these findings, a recent review also suggests that treatment response in PTSD is associated with lower functional activity and connectivity within the anterior insula (Szeszko & Yehuda,  ). Furthermore, activation in the right cerebellum (lobule VI/crus I) during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions was positively correlated to global PTSD symptom severity scores (as well as intrusion, and negative alterations in cognitions and mood symptom clusters). Indeed, lobule VI/crus I regions of the posterior cerebellum are dedicated to cognitive and executive functions, working memory, visuospatial functions, and limbic system processing (Stoodley and Schmahmann,  ) and have been shown previously to be associated with PTSD symptomatology (Rabellino et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nCommon to both groups was the downregulation of various regions in the postcentral gyri, the temporal gyri, and the temporal pole during   regulate   conditions as compared to   view   conditions. The postcentral gyrus represents the primary somatosensory cortex and plays a crucial role in somatosensory representations linked to the perception of emotional and sensory experience (Kragel & LaBar,  ; Cao et\u00a0al.,  ). This is in line with a body of literature that suggests that emotions are represented in the somatosensory system as categorically distinct somatotopic maps associated with unique bodily sensations (Nummenmaa et\u00a0al.,  ). Critically, the postcentral gyrus, along with the superior, mid, and inferior temporal gyri, has been shown to be implicated in the innate alarm system involved in the ultrafast salient detection of danger (Liddell et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ). In relation, the temporal pole is a paralimbic region that is highly interconnected with the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex and is involved in both sensory and limbic processing underlying emotional states (i.e., affective processing) (Olson et\u00a0al.,  ). Previously, we have shown that the temporal pole is hyperconnected to the salience network at rest among PTSD patients as compared to healthy individuals (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ), where the temporal pole has also been shown to be activated during trauma\u2010related autobiographical memory recall and correlated to PTSD symptoms of reexperiencing (Frewen et\u00a0al.,  ; Thome et\u00a0al.,  ). Interestingly, the temporoparietal junction, which includes the posterior superior temporal gyrus, is critical for multisensory integration, bodily self\u2010consciousness, and embodiment (Arzy et\u00a0al.,  ; Blanke,  ; Igelstr\u00f6m et\u00a0al.,  ). Additionally, the superior, inferior, and mid\u2010temporal gyri have been shown to display increased activation in response to trauma\u2010related stimuli and have been correlated to PTSD symptoms of avoidance and dissociation (Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ; Hopper et\u00a0al.,  ; Nilsen et\u00a0al.,  ). Indeed, it has been shown recently that PCC and middle temporal gyrus connectivity negatively correlate with PTSD severity and reexperiencing (Sheynin et\u00a0al.,  ). Although speculative, results from the current study suggest that while downregulating the PCC with NFB during the presentation of trauma stimuli, individuals are also gaining control over the sensory\u2010experience of their trauma\u2010related emotions that are mapped within the somatosensory system. Furthermore, our results also suggest that PCC downregulation results in concomitantly gaining control over temporal lobe regions highly associated with PTSD symptoms, in addition to embodiment, and sensory/limbic processing of emotional states. \n\nFinally, during the transfer run, we found nonsignificant whole\u2010brain activation differences between   regulate   and   view   conditions within the PTSD group and when comparing these conditions between the PTSD and healthy control groups. Nevertheless, within the transfer run, the healthy control group displayed decreased precuneus/PCC and right postcentral gyrus activation during the transfer run for the   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions. This may represent more sustained downregulation effects and optimized NFB learning among healthy controls, as these areas are also shown to be downregulated during the NFB training. Future studies are warranted to investigate if multiple sessions of PCC downregulation with rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB would also result in these sustained transfer run effects within the PTSD group. \n\n\n### Future directions and limitations \n  \nMoving forward, future investigations should examine the combined effects of multiple sessions of NFB\u2010training with respect to PCC downregulation, as well as collect follow\u2010up measures in order to examine sustained effects of this intervention. Functional and effective connectivity analyses of the PCC are also warranted. Furthermore, future studies should examine unique responses to treatment among heterogeneous presentations of PTSD, including the dissociative subtype and complex PTSD diagnoses. In the current study, the influence of past psychotherapy and psychotropic medication on neurofeedback training success was not evaluated. Future studies are needed to examine both the interactive effect of neurofeedback and psychotherapy/psychotropic medication, as well as the use of neurofeedback as an adjunctive treatment for PTSD. Lastly, ideally powered randomized controlled trials with comparisons to sham\u2010NFB and mental rehearsal conditions are also required (Sorger et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nIn summary, we found that both the PTSD and healthy control groups were able to downregulate the PCC with similar success over NFB training and in the transfer run. Indeed, both the PTSD and healthy control groups demonstrated reduced reliving symptoms in response to trauma/stressful stimuli, where the PTSD group additionally demonstrated significantly reduced distress symptoms over NFB training. Here, PCC downregulation was associated with unique within\u2010group   decreases   in activation within the dmPFC, postcentral gyrus, amygdala/hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and temporal pole/middle and superior temporal gyri. By contrast, downregulation was associated with   increased   activation in the right dlPFC among healthy controls as compared to PTSD. During PCC downregulation, right dlPFC activation was negatively correlated to PTSD symptom severity scores and difficulties in emotion regulation. Moreover, anterior insula and cerebellum (lobule VI/crus I) activation was positively correlated to PTSD symptoms. Finally, machine learning algorithms were able to classify participants based on brain activation during NFB training with 80% accuracy. Importantly, this is the first study to investigate PCC downregulation with real\u2010time fMRI NFB in PTSD. Taken together, our results reveal acute decreases in symptoms during PCC NFB training and provide converging evidence for alpha EEG\u2010NFB targeting brain networks linked to the PCC. Future clinical trials of rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB investigating PCC downregulation in PTSD are warranted to leverage the effects of multiple training sessions. \n\n\n\n### PEER REVIEW \n  \nThe peer review history for this article is available at  \n\n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8785646, "text_md5": "826d5b52dd6776c569b64e35487dd047", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 230], "journal": [231, 242], "publication_year": [244, 248], "title": [259, 441], "keywords": [455, 532], "abstract": [545, 2826], "body": [2835, 70914]}, "part": 1, "chapter": 6, "page": 5, "pmid": 34921746, "doi": "10.1002/brb3.2441"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8785646>8785646</a> \u2014 Part 1 Chapter 6 Page 5", "list_title": "1.6.5  Differential mechanisms of posterior cingulate cortex downregulation and symptom decreases in posttraumatic stress disorder and healthy individuals using real\u2010time fMRI neurofeedback"}
