This paper describes a novel approach for combining published neuroimaging results from multiple studies, designed to maximize the quantification of interstudy concordance while minimizing the subjective aspects of meta-analysis.

Regions of significant concordance were identified in bilateral motor and superior temporal cortices, pre-SMA, left fusiform gyrus, and the cerebellum. These meta-analytic results were validated by comparison with new fMRI data on aloud word reading in normal adult subjects. Excellent correspondence between the two statistical maps was observed, with fMRI maxima lying close to all meta-analysis peaks and statistical values at the peaks identified by the two techniques correlating strongly. This close correspondence between PET meta-analysis and fMRI results also demonstrates the validity of using fMRI for the study of language tasks involving overt speech responses. Advantages of this automated meta-analysis technique include quantification of the level of concordance at all brain locations and the provision for use of a threshold for statistical significance of concordance.
