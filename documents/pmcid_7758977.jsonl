Human fMRI studies investigating diet effects on neural processing of food cues could aid in understanding altered brain activation in conditions of under\u2010 and overnutrition. In this preliminary study, we examined brain activity changes in response to 10\u00a0days of high\u2010calorie\u2010diet (HCD), followed by\u00a010\u00a0days of fasting, hypothesizing that HCD would decrease activation in homeostatic and reward regions, while fasting would increase activation in homeostatic/reward regions and decrease activation of self\u2010control regions. Seven adults completed fMRI scanning during a food\u2010cue paradigm (high\u2010 and low\u2010calorie food images and nonfood objects), pre\u2010 and post\u201010\u2010day HCD. Six adults completed fMRI scanning pre\u2010 and post\u201010\u2010day fasting. BOLD\u00a0response changes for contrasts of interest\u00a0pre\u2010 versus post\u2010intervention in regions of interest were examined (peak\u2010level significance set at p(FWE)<0.05). BMI increased by 6.8% and decreased by 8.1% following HCD and fasting, respectively. Following HCD, BOLD response in the hypothalamus (homeostatic control), was attenuated at trend level in response to high\u2010 versus low\u2010calorie foods. Following fasting, BOLD response to food versus objects in inhibitory\u2010control areas (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) was reduced, whereas the activation of homeostatic (hypothalamus), gustatory, and reward brain areas (anterior insula and orbitofrontal cortex) increased. Overfeeding and fasting for 10\u00a0days modulate brain activity in response to food stimuli, suggesting that in healthy adults, changes in energy balance affect saliency and reward value of food cues. Future studies are required to understand this interaction in states of unhealthy weight. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nThe regulation of appetite and food intake is a complex process governed by neural and endocrine signaling in response to energy balance, motivational drive, interoceptive cues, as well as cognitive and attentional processing of external sensory cues. Human neuroimaging studies demonstrate that in healthy individuals, states of hunger and satiety can modulate and bias the neural processing of visual food cues of different caloric value. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the brain response to high\u2010 versus low\u2010calorie visual food images after an overnight fast, healthy participants demonstrated hyperactivation of the hypothalamus, the primary homeostatic control region, as well as brain areas involved in visual processing (inferior temporal visual cortex), attention and motor control (posterior parietal cortex and premotor cortex, and memory (hippocampus) (Cornier et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Additionally, activation in reward\u2010 and interoception\u2010related brain areas such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the insular cortex is increased in response to palatable food images following a short\u2010term (3\u00a0hr) fast (Frank et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) as well as an overnight fast (Fuhrer et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Goldstone et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) with positive correlations between the duration of caloric deprivation (1 to 16\u00a0hr) and degree of neural activation in the OFC, as well as brain areas of attention (anterior cingulate cortex), motivation (putamen), and motor control (precentral gyrus) (Stice et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nIn comparison, satiation produces a robust decrease in food\u2010cue elicited brain activity in reward\u2010related areas (amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and anterior fusiform gyrus) (LaBar et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) as well as increased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), an area primarily involved in decision making and exerting inhibitory\u2010control over hedonic drives (Thomas et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Interestingly, when overfed by 30% above caloric need for 2\u00a0days and then evaluated after an overnight fast, healthy\u2010weight individuals demonstrated attenuated hypothalamic activation to high\u2010calorie visual food images compared with robust activation seen after 2\u00a0days of controlled eucaloric diet (Cornier et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), suggesting that interoceptive signals reflecting physiological needs appropriately bias the cognitive perception of visual food images (Burgess et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nWhile there is ample evidence that healthy\u2010weight individuals exhibit changes in brain activation in response to visual food images following an overnight fast and postprandially, well\u2010controlled studies examining fMRI brain activation in response to prolonged (>2\u00a0days) fasting and high\u2010calorie diet interventions resulting in measurable, acute weight changes in humans are lacking. Such studies could improve our understanding of the adaptive neuronal mechanisms in response to more prolonged caloric restriction and overfeeding resulting in weight changes, and thus create the foundations to better understand the neuronal perturbations that occur at extremes of eating behavior, for example, chronic starvation and hyperphagia. \n\nThe aim of the present pilot study was to examine changes in fMRI activation in response to 10\u00a0days of overfeeding intended to result in 7%\u201310% weight gain, followed by 10\u00a0days of complete caloric deprivation, separated by a 2\u2010week interval of unsupervised diet. We hypothesized that in healthy men and women, excessive caloric consumption leading to acute weight gain would result in diminished fMRI activation of homeostatic and reward regions important for food processing specifically in response to high\u2010calorie food images, whereas complete caloric deprivation resulting in acute weight loss would lead to increased activation of homeostasis and reward areas and decreased activation of inhibitory control brain regions in response to images of food varying in caloric content. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nHealthy, adult participants were recruited as part of a multidisciplinary study designed to examine the effects of acute weight changes on skeletal and marrow adipose tissue remodeling. All subjects included in the current fMRI study performed both diet interventions\u2014overfeeding and fasting, in the same order (for details, see Procedure). Seven subjects (2 men, 5 women; mean age\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0  SEM  : 31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0years; mean BMI\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0  SEM  : 26.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0kg/m ) completed fMRI scanning pre\u2010 and post\u201010\u2010day HCD. Six subjects (1 man; 5 women; mean age: 29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9\u00a0years; mean BMI: 26.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0kg/m ) completed fMRI scanning pre\u2010 and post\u201010\u2010day fast. Overall, three participants performed all four scans (prior and following each diet intervention). Subjects were recruited through online advertisements. Inclusion criteria included 101%\u2013120% of ideal body weight (to avoid a potential negative impact due to the fasting intervention) and regular menses for women (cycling every 21\u201335\u00a0days). Exclusion criteria included a history of chronic illness, untreated thyroid dysfunction, history of an eating disorder, active substance abuse, abnormal transaminase levels (AST/ALT), hypokalemia (potassium\u00a0<\u00a03.5\u00a0mEq/L), pregnancy, breastfeeding, and MRI contraindications. Due to the main study aim to investigate bone health, participants taking medications known to affect bone metabolism (e.g., systemic steroids and immunosuppressants) were excluded from the study. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nThis study was approved by the Partners HealthCare Institutional Review Board and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was preregistered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02482519). All subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation, obtained by a licensed physician investigator or nurse practitioner. Subjects were admitted to the Translational and Clinical Research Center (TCRC) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for an outpatient screening visit including a medical history, physical exam, and blood work to determine eligibility. Eligible subjects were admitted to the TCRC for the main study visits which occurred over the course of 35\u00a0days. The main study included an initial 10\u2010day inpatient HCD weight\u2010gain period (days 1\u201311), followed by a 13\u201318\u00a0day outpatient unsupervised diet (\u201cwash\u2010out,\u201d days 11\u201324), followed by a 10\u2010day inpatient fast (days 25\u201335). During the HCD intervention, subjects were fed a high fat/high carbohydrate diet individually tailored to result in a 7%\u201310% weight gain, planned and supervised by an experienced bionutritionist at the TCRC. The amount of daily calories ordered for each participant was established by calculating the Basal Metabolic Rate (using the Mifflin St Jeor equation) and adding 20% on top of the final result to achieve a positive energy balance (Frankenfield et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). During the overfeeding intervention, the study nutritionist examined the daily percent change in body weight and evaluated meal completion to assess the need for diet modifications. When participants were able to fully complete their meal but did not gain enough weight, food items were altered to increase the daily caloric consumption. When participants were struggling to complete their meal, a high\u2010calorie milkshake was added in addition to their meal. After a wash\u2010out period, subjects were readmitted to the TCRC for a 10\u2010day fast, using a validated protocol (Fazeli et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). During fasting, subjects were given water ad libitum, 20\u00a0meq of oral potassium chloride daily to prevent hypokalemia, and a multivitamin. During the inpatient portions of the study, subjects were free to move around the TCRC or remain in their room where they had a TV. Participants remained inpatient for 24hr following the fasting intervention to gradually increase caloric intake under medical supervision. All subjects were blinded to their weights during the entire study. \n\n\n### Functional MRI Paradigm \n  \nBrain fMRI was performed after an overnight fast on the first and last day of both diet interventions. A urine HCG test was completed in females prior to scanning. fMRI scanning was performed during a well\u2010established food motivation paradigm (Holsen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) programmed through Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems). Briefly, at each visit, subjects viewed 100 high\u2010calorie food stimuli, 100 low\u2010calorie food stimuli, 100 non\u2010food\u2010related household objects, and 100 fixation stimuli (blurred images) in a block design, with each stimulus presented for 3\u00a0s. Subjects were instructed to press a button when pictures changed to ensure attention. A total of five 4\u2010min runs with five images in each block and 16 blocks in each run were completed at each visit. At each of the pre and postintervention visits, subjects viewed images from one of two parallel versions of the task (each with 400 unique images from the conditions above), with order randomized across subjects. \n\n\n### MRI Acquisition Parameters \n  \nMRI data were acquired using a Siemens 3T Trio scanner (Siemens) at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. A gradient\u2010echo EPI pulse sequence was used (33 contiguous oblique\u2010axial slices, 4\u2010mm thick, TR/TE\u00a0=\u00a02000/30\u00a0ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0, FOV\u00a0=\u00a0200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0200\u00a0mm, 120 total images per run). A sagittal 3D SPGR (T1\u2010weighted) sequence was acquired (TR/TE\u00a0=\u00a02350/3.39\u00a0ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a07\u00b0, FOV\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256\u00a0mm, effective slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a01.33\u00a0mm with 128 slices) for co\u2010registration between structural and functional datasets. Head movements were restricted with foam cushions. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nfMRI data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging). Volumes were realigned and unwarped with phase correction provided from the fieldmap, normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute MNI152 brain template, re\u2010sampled to 3\u00a0mm isotropic, and smoothed with a 6\u00a0mm Gaussian kernel. Outliers in the global mean image time series (threshold: 3.5   SD  ) and movement (threshold: 0.8\u00a0mm, scan\u2010to\u2010scan movement) were detected using ART ( ) and entered as nuisance regressors in the single\u2010subject level GLM. Masks excluding voxels outside the brain were applied to ensure that voxels in regions with signal dropout were not arbitrarily excluded. For the block design, each stimulus type was modeled using a boxcar function convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Contrasts of interest (food\u00a0>\u00a0objects; high\u2010calorie food\u00a0>\u00a0low\u2010calorie food) from the first\u2010level analysis were tested using linear contrasts and SPM t\u2010maps, then submitted to second\u2010level random\u2010effects group analysis. The contrast of high\u2010calorie food\u00a0>\u00a0low\u2010calorie food was chosen as the contrast of interest for the pre\u2010 versus post\u2010HCD analysis based on the prediction that this contrast would be uniquely sensitive to changes induced by the high\u2010calorie diet foods consumed during the HCD intervention. Conversely, the food\u00a0>\u00a0objects contrast was selected for the pre\u2010 versus post\u2010fasting analysis based on the expectation that this more general contrast would be specifically sensitive to changes induced by lack of intake of any food during the fasting intervention. Effects of interest at the group level were examined using paired   t  \u2010tests (pre\u2010 vs. post\u2010HCD; pre\u2010 vs. post\u2010fast). For transparency, post hoc complementary analyses were completed to examine changes in response to food\u00a0>\u00a0objects contrast for the pre\u2010 to post\u2010HCD intervention, and changes in response to high\u2010calorie food\u00a0>\u00a0low\u2010calorie food contrast for the pre\u2010 to post\u2010fasting intervention. For each set of analyses, region of interest (ROI) analyses were performed using small volume correction which corrects for the number of voxels within an anatomical ROI. Multiple comparisons were controlled using a combination of cluster extent (k\u00a0\u2265\u00a05 in hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens; k\u00a0\u2265\u00a020 in other ROIs) and   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05 FWE\u2010corrected thresholds. ROI were selected a priori and included the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, OFC, amygdala, insula, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Anatomical borders of the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, OFC, amygdala, and insula were defined using a manually segmented MNI brain [based on methods established by the Center for Morphometric Analysis at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School (Makris et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ,  ). Anatomical borders of the DLPFC were derived from Middle Frontal Gyrus region as defined by the AAL atlas (Tzourio\u2010Mazoyer et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Average parameter estimates within each ROI for each participant were extracted from clusters within each ROI meeting statistical thresholds using the Region of Interest Extraction Toolbox (REX) and exported to SPSS (v19, Chicago, IL) for graphical depiction. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nMean BMI increased by 6.8%\u00b10.7 following HCD, was almost fully restored at the end of the wash\u2010out period and decreased by 8.1%\u00b10.6 following the fasting intervention (see Table\u00a0 ). Following HCD intervention, hypothalamic BOLD response was attenuated at a trend level in response to high\u2010 versus low\u2010calorie food images (Table\u00a0 ; Figure\u00a0 ). There were no regions in which BOLD response to all food images   (high\u2010calorie\u00a0+\u00a0low\u2010calorie)   versus objects changed significantly following HCD intervention. \n  \nMeans and ranges of BMIs before and after each diet intervention \n      \nChange in BOLD response to food stimuli following 10\u2010day HCD and 10\u2010day fast \n      \nChange in Neural Response to High\u2010 versus Low\u2010calorie Food before and after HCD.

Bar graph on the right of the figure visually presents the mean BOLD response to the High\u2010calorie\u00a0>\u00a0Low\u2010calorie food contrast within the cluster (  k  \u00a0=\u00a05) meeting statistical thresholds (defined in the Methods; see Table\u00a0  for MNI coordinates) for the Pre\u2010HCD (gray bar) versus Post\u2010HCD (white bar) comparison \n  \nFollowing the 10\u2010day fast, BOLD response in the DLPFC was reduced in response to food images compared with objects (Table\u00a0 ; Figure\u00a0 ). Conversely, following the fasting intervention, BOLD response to food versus objects increased significantly in the OFC and insula and at a trend level in the hypothalamus (Table\u00a0 ; Figure\u00a0 b\u2010d). The 10\u2010day fast did not induce significant BOLD changes in a priori ROIs in response to high\u2010 versus low\u2010calorie food images. \n  \nChange in Neural Response to Food versus Objects before and after Fasting.

Specifically, following an overfeeding intervention associated with a mean BMI increase of 6.8%, subjects exhibited trend\u2010level attenuated hypothalamic activation, reflecting homeostatic control, in response to high\u2010 versus low\u2010calorie foods. Conversely, 10\u00a0days of fasting induced a mean BMI decrease of 8.1%, reduced activation in response to food images versus objects in inhibitory control areas (DLPFC), and increased activation in homeostatic (hypothalamus), interoception (anterior insula), and reward valuation (orbitofrontal cortex) brain regions. There is strong evidence that in healthy individuals, fMRI activation in food motivation brain areas is altered in states of short\u2010term hunger and satiety (Cornier et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Frank et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Goldstone et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; LaBar et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). However, the majority of these studies examined the effects of an overnight fast or a meal on the brain response to food cues and were not associated with a change in weight status. Our novel study design allowed an evaluation of the neurobiological response to visual food images following a relatively prolonged diet intervention resulting in significant acute weight changes, thus more closely mimicking extremes of disordered eating leading to unhealthy weight and associated co\u2010morbidities. \n\nIn our study, following 10\u00a0days of overfeeding, subjects demonstrated trend\u2010level attenuated hypothalamic activation in response to high\u2010calorie versus low\u2010calorie food images. The hypothalamus is critically involved in integrating internal homeostatic signals with external cues and input from high\u2010order brain regions important for emotional, cognitive, and reward processing and it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity (Roth et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Thaler et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). More specifically, rodent studies show that caloric excess triggers an inflammatory hypothalamic response altering the intricate neuroendocrine hypothalamic network regulating appetite and energy balance (Razolli et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Hypothalamic inflammation is associated with the proliferation of glial cells which can be detected in human structural MRI studies. Signs of hypothalamic gliosis and inflammation can be seen in adults and even children with obesity and are positively associated with adiposity (Schur et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Sewaybricker et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). fMRI studies provide further insight into the hypothalamic perturbations associated with obesity. While healthy\u2010weight individuals demonstrate dose\u2010dependent reductions in hypothalamic fMRI signal following glucose ingestion (Smeets et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) and in response to high\u2010calorie food images following overfeeding for 2\u00a0days (Cornier et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), individuals with overweight/obesity do not show the same hypothalamic response (Cornier et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Matsuda et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Our finding of trend\u2010level attenuated hypothalamic activation in response to high\u2010 versus low\u2010calorie food images following 10\u00a0days of caloric excess, suggests that differential hypothalamic responsivity to external food cues representing divergent rewarding value is maintained following 10\u00a0days of overfeeding associated with weight gain. These findings are of interest since rodent studies show that 3\u00a0days of high\u2010fat diet are sufficient to induce proinflammatory hypothalamic response associated with altered mitochondrial function and synaptic plasticity as well as impaired functional and molecular activation of insulin\u2010signaling pathways (Jais & Bruning,\u00a0 ; McLean et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; De Souza et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe prolonged fasting intervention implemented in our study provides a model through which to understand restrictive eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa (AN), a condition associated with severe, chronic starvation. AN is associated with dysfunction of appetite\u2010regulating brain areas (Lloyd & Steinglass,\u00a0 ), including hypoactivation of these areas (e.g., insula, OFC, and hypothalamus) in response to high\u2010calorie foods after a 12\u2010hr overnight fast (Holsen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) and hyperactivation of the DLPFC in response to high\u2010calorie food images (Brooks et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Altered reward and interoceptive processing of hedonic food cues (e.g., palatable food images and tastes of sucrose) as seen in fMRI studies and following a 12\u201316\u00a0hr fast also exists in women who remitted from AN, thus eliminating a confounding factor of malnutrition on food motivation neurocircuitry response and supporting pathological inherent mechanisms facilitating extended periods of food avoidance (Holsen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Kaye et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Our subjects demonstrated clear hyperactivation of homeostatic and food motivation brain areas as well as hypoactivation of the DLPFC following 10\u2010day fasting, which we speculate could provide a neural signature of the state of acute starvation in otherwise healthy adults. Since most fMRI studies designed to learn about differences in food\u2010cue processing between AN patients and healthy controls were conducted following a short\u2010term fast, our study adds to the literature by providing greater resemblance to the prolonged starvation associated with weight loss seen in AN. Additional studies are needed to further delineate the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of chronic starvation observed in AN. Our study design may also provide important information regarding neurobiological features of food processing in atypical anorexia nervosa (AAN), a relatively new diagnosis introduced in the DSM\u20105 (APA,\u00a0 ). Patients with AAN have similar features to patients with AN (e.g., significant food restriction and intense fear of weight gain), however, they are not underweight; rather, they have BMIs in the normal to overweight/obesity range (Matthews et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Moskowitz & Weiselberg,\u00a0 ). fMRI studies examining food cues processing in patients with AAN are lacking. Future studies comparing fMRI responses to food cues in patients with AAN compared to BMI\u2010matched controls could provide important knowledge regarding perturbation in the neurocircuitry of eating behavior in AAN. Finally, it is also important to note that prolonged fasting (greater than ~14\u00a0hr), is associated with significant cellular, metabolic and endocrine adaptions that could potentially affect appetite and subsequently fMRI activation in response to visual food stimuli. Prolonged fasting is associated with a \u201cmetabolic switch,\u201d transitioning from using glucose and carbohydrates as fuel sources for both body and brain to fatty acids and ketones (Mattson et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). It is also associated with marked changes in appetite\u2010regulating hormones such as leptin, insulin, ghrelin, and cortisol (Freire & Alvarez\u2010Leite,\u00a0 ; Rajpal & Ismail\u2010Beigi,\u00a0 ; Steinhauser et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Future studies comprehensively evaluating both neural activation to food stimuli together with neuroendocrine adaptation to prolonged fasting will be important to conduct. \n\nOur findings are limited by the small sample size, although the significant effects observed following the diet interventions suggest adequate power for the statistical analysis approach implemented in this pilot study. Additionally, to avoid the potential harmful consequences of the fasting intervention, participants recruited to this study were on average slightly overweight (101%\u2013120% of ideal body weight). Since chronic obesity is associated with altered fMRI brain activation in response to high\u2010calorie food images (Devoto et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), the mild excess weight of the participants could have affected the results seen in our investigation. Another limitation relates to the known gender differences in visual processing of food images in hunger and satiety (Chao et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) that we could not capture in our small sample. It is also important to note that three of the total number of subjects who participated in this study performed both fMRI evaluations (pre\u2010 and post\u2010overfeeding and fasting), and we cannot exclude a confounding effect of the familiarity with the visual stimuli presented during the fMRI task. Finally, the brain activation observed following fasting in this study could have been impacted by the prior high\u2010calorie diet intervention which all subjects received due to the study design. Future similar studies could include a randomized, crossover study design to minimize the potential confounding effect of participating in the two diet interventions in the same order (overfeeding followed by fasting). \n\nIn summary, our preliminary, novel findings demonstrate that 10\u00a0days of extreme diet intervention modulate brain activation in regions related to homeostasis, reward, interoception, and inhibitory control in a nutritional status\u2010dependent manner. A comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of the neurophysiology underlying states of hunger and satiety in healthy individuals could support research of disordered eating. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nNone. \n\n\n## DISCLOSURE \n  \nDr. Lawson has served on the scientific advisory board and has a financial interest in OXT Therapeutics, a company developing an intranasal oxytocin and long\u2010acting analogs of oxytocin to treat obesity and metabolic disease.
