However, prolonged motivational salience of the deceased partner may be a complicating factor, particularly when coupled with perseverative thinking about the loss. We investigated how prolonged grief symptoms might relate to resting state functional brain network connectivity in a sample of older adults (  n  \u00a0=\u00a038) who experienced the death of a partner 6\u201336\u2009months prior, and whether intranasal oxytocin (as a neuropeptide involved in pair\u2010bonding) had differential effects in participants with higher prolonged grief symptoms. Higher scores on the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) were associated with lower anticorrelation (i.e., higher functional connectivity) between the default  \u2013 cingulo\u2010opercular  network pair. Intranasal oxytocin increased functional connectivity in the same default  \u2013 cingulo\u2010opercular  circuit but ICG scores did not moderate effects of oxytocin, contrary to our prediction. Higher ICG scores were associated with longer dwell time in a dynamic functional connectivity state featuring positive correlations among default, frontoparietal, and cingulo\u2010opercular networks, across both placebo and oxytocin sessions. Dwell time was not significantly affected by oxytocin, and higher prolonged grief symptoms were not associated with more variability in dynamic functional connectivity states over the scan. Results offer preliminary evidence that prolonged grief symptoms in older adults are associated with patterns of static and time\u2010varying functional network connectivity and may specifically involve a default network\u2010salience\u2010related circuit that is sensitive to oxytocin. \n  \nIn older adults who experienced the death of a partner, higher prolonged grief symptoms were associated with less anticorrelation between retrosplenial default network and cingulo\u2010opercular networks during resting state, and more dwell time in a dynamic functional connectivity state involving positive correlations between large\u2010scale brain networks typically anticorrelated at rest. Intranasal oxytocin administration increased functional connectivity in the same retrosplenial default network \u2010 cingulo\u2010opercular network circuit that was associated with higher prolonged grief symptoms, but oxytocin did not have differential effects in higher vs. lower prolonged grief symptom participants   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nThe death of a partner requires us to adapt to a fundamentally changed world (O'Connor & Seeley,\u00a0 ). Grief resolves over time for most people, but some continue to experience intense, impairing grieving without apparent resolution in sight (Prigerson et al.,  ). The condition of severe, chronic grieving (previously: \u201ccomplicated grief\u201d) is currently known as \u201cprolonged grief\u201d or \u201cprolonged grief disorder.\u201d Effective coping draws on the capacity to flexibly shift focus between loss\u2010 and restoration\u2010related stressors (Stroebe & Schut,\u00a0 ; Stroebe et al.,\u00a0 ). However, the time scale at which this oscillation should take place (and the measurement thereof), remains to be satisfactorily established (Stroebe et al.,\u00a0 ). Potentially, we could gain insight into how the bereavement adaptation process goes awry by examining the organization and functioning of large\u2010scale brain networks. \n\nPerseverative, self\u2010referential thoughts interfere with grief adaptation, and contribute to distress (e.g., Eisma et al.,\u00a0 ; Maccallum & Bryant,\u00a0 ; Robinaugh & McNally,\u00a0 ). One specific complicating process occurs when bereaved people rely on avoidance to manage emotional pain; with the unfortunate outcome that avoidance reinforces monitoring for, and thus salience of, deceased\u2010related cues (Robinaugh et al.,\u00a0 ; Schneck et al.,\u00a0 ,  ). \n\nA second important complicating factor in grief is thought to be prolonged, frustrative proximity\u2010seeking (Kakarala et al.,\u00a0 ; LeRoy et al.,\u00a0 ). Intense yearning for reunion is mediated by oxytocin (Hurlemann & Scheele,\u00a0 ; Pohl et al.,\u00a0 ; Schiele et al.,\u00a0 ), which regulates attachment formation and maintenance (e.g., Bosch & Young,\u00a0 ) and heightens attention to both aversive and appetitive social stimuli (Bartz et al.,\u00a0 ,  ; Eckstein et al.,\u00a0 ; Shamay\u2010Tsoory & Abu\u2010Akel,\u00a0 ). Exogenous oxytocin altered resting state functional connectivity among networks that regulate internal versus external focus (e.g., salience, attention, and default networks), and broadly increased cortical\u2013subcortical functional connectivity (Seeley et al.,  ), with a recent study highlighting greater dynamic effective connectivity   within   salience network regions and   from   precuneus and posterior cingulate (i.e., default network) to salience network regions in their oxytocin\u2010treated group (Jiang et al.,\u00a0 ). Oxytocin's ability to elicit this kind of temporary \u201cfunctional rewiring\u201d likely underlies its effects on self\u2010referential cognition (Liu et al.,\u00a0 ,  ). \n\nThere is growing evidence for differences in large\u2010scale network function associated with grief severity and prolonged grief, in line with evidence from other affective disorders that similarly feature symptoms like emotional distress and perseverative thinking (Kaiser et al.,\u00a0 ). Interindividual differences in default network and frontotemporoparietal connectivity are associated with avoidance coping, selective attention to loss cues, and intrusion monitoring in grief (Liu et al.,\u00a0 ; Schneck et al.,\u00a0 ,  ). Earlier cross\u2010sectional fMRI studies demonstrated correlations between yearning and BOLD activation in salience and reward circuit regions, including anterior cingulate and nucleus accumbens (McConnell et al.,\u00a0 ; O'Connor et al.,  ). In a recent longitudinal study, bereaved adults who displayed greater amygdala functional connectivity with salience and executive control networks experienced worsening grief symptoms over time. Cross\u2010sectionally, higher prolonged grief symptoms were associated with greater amygdala functional connectivity with posterior default network regions (Chen et al.,  ). Further, treatment\u2010seeking bereaved adults who received 8\u2009weeks of mindfulness\u2010based cognitive therapy showed decreased resting state functional connectivity between salience, default, and executive control networks (Huang et al.,  ). Thus, the present study sought to investigate whether oxytocin and self\u2010referential cognition have interactive effects on prolonged grief symptoms, potentially via effects on functional network connectivity during unconstrained thought. \n\nWe developed hypotheses informed by Christoff et al. ( ) dynamic framework for spontaneous thought, which proposes a role for flexible network coupling in shaping thoughts' focus and timecourse via both \u201cautomatic\u201d (or involuntary) and \u201cdeliberate\u201d (or intentional) constraints. Importantly, automatic constraints can be internal (e.g., a strong emotion; self\u2010relevance), not only external stimuli. Prolonged grief perhaps involves more automatic constraints over thought   content  : the continued salience of mental representations of the deceased and/or their death could underlie the prolonged emotional pain, intense yearning, and/or the intrusive nature of thoughts about the loss that characterize prolonged grief (Robinaugh et al.,\u00a0 ). Thoughts in prolonged grief might also be   less variable over time  , given that grief\u2010related rumination likely involves core midline default network regions that have been implicated in other forms of maladaptive self\u2010referential thought (e.g., Fonzo & Etkin,\u00a0 ; Zhou et al.,\u00a0 ) and other disorders characterized by high levels of perseveration and distress show reduced dFNC variability (e.g., Demirta\u015f et al.,\u00a0 ; Kaiser et al.,\u00a0 ). Operantly defined, higher levels of prolonged grief symptoms might be reflected in greater affective (automatic) constraints over thought content, and less variability, as evidenced by (1) positive correlation between salience network and midline default network time courses (Menon,\u00a0 ) and (2) fewer transitions between different dFNC \u201cstates\u201d (transient, yet recurrent functional network configurations, and/or longer dwell time in one dFNC state. Given the role of cognitive control in deliberately guiding ones' focus, we also hypothesized that individuals with prolonged grief might show weaker functional connectivity of the frontoparietal network with salience and default networks. While static or time\u2010averaged, functional network connectivity could test the first hypothesis, the latter requires capturing temporal variability that might provide additional insight to the time\u2010invariant observations via dynamic functional connectivity methods (Kucyi et al.,\u00a0 ; Lurie et al.,  ). \n\nThe current study leveraged existing data from a parent study, in which older adults with varying levels of prolonged grief symptoms participated in two fMRI sessions each as part of a within\u2010subjects crossover design that included oxytocin as a mechanistic probe (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04505904). At one session, they received intranasal oxytocin and at the other, a placebo. Our first aim (data from placebo sessions only) was to identify whether static (FNC) and/or dynamic (dFNC) resting state functional network connectivity was associated with prolonged grief symptoms. We hypothesized that (1A) participants with higher levels of prolonged grief symptoms would show fewer dFNC state transitions over time, and (1B) participants with higher levels of prolonged grief symptoms would show higher overall functional connectivity between default and salience networks, lesser functional connectivity with the frontoparietal network, and longer dwell time in a state featuring positive FNC between salience and default networks. Our second aim (data from both sessions) was to investigate intranasal oxytocin's effect on FNC and dFNC in an older, bereaved sample, and to evaluate prolonged grief symptoms as a potential moderator of these effects. We hypothesized that (2A) oxytocin (vs. placebo) would increase salience network functional connectivity with the other large\u2010scale networks (default and frontoparietal) hypothesized to be related to prolonged grief symptoms, and (2B) oxytocin will have greater influence on FNC and/or dFNC for participants with higher levels of prolonged grief symptoms. \n\n\n## METHOD \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were 40 community\u2010dwelling older adults recruited from the southern Arizona area. All were between 55 and 80\u2009years of age (M\u00a0=\u00a069.22\u2009years, SD\u00a0=\u00a06.49, and range\u00a0=\u00a057\u201379) and had experienced the death of a spouse or long\u2010term romantic partner 6\u201336\u2009months prior to participation (M\u00a0=\u00a015.40\u2009months and SD\u00a0=\u00a08.17). Stratified sampling ensured that a full range of ICG scores was represented (M\u00a0=\u00a023.35, SD\u00a0=\u00a012.47, and range\u00a0=\u00a04\u201351). All female participants were postmenopausal. \n\n\n### Design and procedures \n  \nAll aspects of the study were approved by the University of Arizona's Institutional Review Board Human Subjects Protection Program. Participants who passed a phone screening interview gave written informed consent and were compensated $200 for completing the study. Enrolled participants also provided personal photos of their spouse and a living loved one for use in a behavioral task for the parent study. \n\nParticipants underwent two scan sessions, a week apart. At each session, they received a double\u2010blinded nasal spray (oxytocin/placebo) and completed a brief measure of their current emotional state. After nasal spray administration followed by a 30\u2010min wait (to allow for oxytocin serum rise\u2010time), structural and functional MRI were performed with total scan time of ~35\u2009min. The resting state sequence was always last, preceded by the structural image acquisition and a behavioral task (Arizmendi et al.,\u00a0 ) in which participants viewed photos of their deceased partner, a living loved one, and generic death\u2010related scenes (e.g., hospital room, casket, and gravestone). Resting state began around 68\u2009min after nasal spray administration. The latency did not significantly differ between oxytocin and placebo sessions (see Supporting Information\u00a0 ). For the resting state scan, participants were instructed to stay awake while a fixation cross was presented on the screen, and \u201clet [their] thoughts come and go as they normally do, but please do not engage in any specific mental activity, such as counting or meditating\u201d to prevent sleep and movement, and encourage participants to allow their mind to wander as it typically would during times of unconstrained thought (Benjamin et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Materials and measures \n  \n#### Measures \n  \nEnrolled participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory\u2010II (BDI\u2010II) (Beck et al.,\u00a0 ) and the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG; Prigerson et al.,\u00a0 ) from their home computer via Qualtrics before they could attend the first fMRI session. Participants who did not have an email address or preferred not to complete the measures on a computer were mailed paper copies and a prepaid business envelope. They had to return the completed surveys to the lab before they could participate in their first fMRI session. Each participant completed the ICG and BDI\u2010II only once. The ICG is a 19\u2010item measure of prolonged grief symptoms distinct from depression or anxiety which showed high internal consistency in our sample (Cronbach's alpha\u00a0=\u00a00.93). At the beginning of each scan session (before nasal spray administration), participants completed the state version of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson et al.,  ), which measures momentary affect along two subscales (positive affect; PANAS\u2010PA, and negative affect; PANAS\u2010NA). \n\n\n#### Intranasal spray \n  \nAt each visit, participants received a double\u2010blinded nasal spray containing either intranasal oxytocin or placebo. A single dose (24\u2009IU; MacDonald et al.,\u00a0 ) of synthetic oxytocin (Syntocinon, Novartis, Switzerland) or the placebo (Novartis, Switzerland: all nonactive ingredients of Syntocinon) was self\u2010administered via six 4\u2010IU puffs into each nostril, alternating nostrils between each puff. All participants received both oxytocin and placebo sprays. At the second fMRI session, they received whichever of the nasal sprays was not given at their first session (i.e., if they were assigned to get oxytocin at Session 1, they would get the placebo at Session 2\u2014or vice versa). \n\n\n#### Randomization \n  \nAfter a participant was enrolled, a research assistant in the lab (who was not involved in the study in any other capacity) used a random number generator to determine the order in which the new participant would be administered the nasal sprays. Nasal spray vials were labeled \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d and the research assistant was the only one who knew the vials' true identity until data collection for the parent study was finished. \n\n\n####  MRI   acquisition parameters \n  \nImaging data were acquired on a Siemens Magnetom Skyra 3\u00a0T MRI scanner with 32\u2010channel head coil (Syngo MR E11 software, field strength 2.89) at Banner University Medical Center in Tucson, AZ. A seven\u2010minute structural T1\u2010weighted MPRAGE sequence preceded the functional scans (TR\u00a0=\u00a02300\u2009ms, TE\u00a0=\u00a02.3\u00a0ms, TI\u00a0=\u00a0900\u2009ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a08\u00b0, matrix size\u00a0=\u00a0256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, 0.9\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009mm voxels, 192 slices). Resting state fMRI data were collected during a 6\u2010min, single\u2010echo EPI sequence with 180 contiguous whole\u2010brain functional volumes (TR\u00a0=\u00a02000\u2009ms, TE\u00a0=\u00a030\u2009ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0, matrix\u00a0=\u00a092\u2009\u00d7\u200980, 2.6\u2009\u00d7\u20092.6\u2009\u00d7\u20093.5\u2009mm voxels, 29 slices). \n\n\n\n###  MRI   data preprocessing \n  \nTwo of the 40 participants were excluded from further analysis due to excessive movement and/or incomplete brain coverage. Preprocessing used fMRIPrep 1.1.8 (Esteban et al.,\u00a0 ,  ; RRID:SCR_016216), which is based on Nipype 1.1.3 (Gorgolewski et al.,\u00a0 ,  ; RRID:SCR_002502). fMRI data underwent nonaggressive denoising via ICA\u2010AROMA during preprocessing. A detailed description of the preprocessing pipeline and procedures is provided in Supporting Information . \n\n\n###  MRI   data postprocessing: Group   ICA  \n  \n#### Group   ICA  \n  \nWe used the Group ICA of fMRI Toolbox (GIFT) 4.0b (Rachakonda et al.,\u00a0 ) to decompose the imaging data into components representing \u201cfunctional networks\u201d via group spatial ICA (GICA). GICA back\u2010reconstructs individual subject spatial maps and time courses from the group\u2010level data reduction and ICA estimates and is shown to be more robust than GICA2 or GICA3 for low model order data (Rachakonda et al.,\u00a0 ). Data reduction incorporated both experimental sessions, with \u201csession\u201d as a repeated (oxytocin or placebo) so that ICs at each session could be directly compared. \n\nICA was run iteratively 10 times using both random initial values and bootstrapping using ICASSO in GIFT (Himberg & Hyv\u00e4rinen,\u00a0 ). Spatial maps and time courses for each session and subject were then back\u2010reconstructed, or estimated, using GICA (Calhoun et al.,\u00a0 ), and scaled to Z\u2010scores. A covariance matrix representing static FNC was estimated from Pearson correlation coefficients obtained by averaging the time course correlation between every IC pair (Figure\u00a0 ). Additional details of data reduction, postprocessing and component labeling approach are included in Supporting Information (p.  ). \n\nIndependent components (ICs) at the group level were selected in a two\u2010step process. First, ICs were classified as artifact, mixed/undetermined, or probable resting state network based on their spatial distribution, power spectra, and ICASSO stability estimates (Allen et al.,\u00a0 ; see also Supporting Information p.   for details). Nineteen of the 30 ICs were classified as resting state networks (Table\u00a0 ; Figure\u00a0 ). Of the 19 ICs, we identified six components corresponding to the three large\u2010scale networks of interest in the current study (default, salience, and frontoparietal; Figure\u00a0 ): default  (IC10), default  (IC27), cingulo\u2010opercular network (IC12, IC26), and frontoparietal network (IC6, IC17). Note that, we decided to re\u2010label the network for ICs involving anterior insula and dorsal ACC, based on anatomical distribution (i.e.,   cingulo\u2010opercular network  ) to avoid assumptions about their function in responding to salient stimuli (as no stimuli were presented during resting state). Second, we examined the individual component maps at each session for the six components. Two more ICs were subsequently excluded. Although the spatial maps for IC12 and IC17 initially appeared to be adequate, a closer examination revealed signal from nonbrain sources: very low fALFF illustrated by a second peak in the high frequency range, which typically indicates noise from other sources (IC12) and the spatial map for the oxytocin session showing eyeball\u2010related movement (IC17). ICs 10 (default ), 27 (default ), 26 (cingulo\u2010opercular ), and 6 (right frontoparietal), were retained based on their signal quality and relevance to the current study aims. \n  \nSpatial maps of ICs comprising selected resting state networks from the group ICA, thresholded at   Z  \u00a0=\u00a02 and displayed on a standard T1 template image. ICs 10 (default ), 27 (default ), 26 (cingulo\u2010opercular ), and 6 (right frontoparietal), were selected for FNC analyses based on their signal quality and relevance to the current study aims \n  \n\n\n###  MRI   data postprocessing: Dynamic functional network connectivity (  dFNC  ) \n  \ndFNC \u201cstates\u201d represent transient yet recurrent functional network configurations from which additional temporal metrics can be derived. The following postprocessing steps were conducted via the dFNC Toolbox (dFNC v1.0a; Allen et al.,\u00a0 ) as implemented in GIFT (Rachakonda et al.,\u00a0 ). A detailed description and validation of the dFNC approach used here is available in Allen et al. ( ). Data from both sessions were analyzed together so that we could compare the same states under oxytocin versus placebo. States were estimated from subject\u2010specific ICA timecourses, using a tapered sliding window of 22 TRs convolved with a Gaussian \ud835\udf0e =\u20093 TRs slid in steps of 1 TR (155 windows per session). The choice of window length was based on the approach described in Allen et al. ( ), in which a tapered 44\u2010second window achieved the best compromise in resolving dynamics versus providing the best estimate of the covariance matrix. Time windows with local maxima in functional connectivity variance (\u201csubject exemplars\u201d) were chosen by subsampling windows/pairs for each subject.   k  \u2010means clustering was applied to individual subject matrices representing changes in correlation as a function of time. The clustering analysis yielded four cluster centroids (covariance patterns), or dynamic \u201cstates,\u201d with the number of clusters chosen based on the elbow criterion for different   k   values. A representative dFNC matrix for each state was calculated on each subject by averaging dFNC matrices of that state. Figure\u00a0  shows centroids for the four dFNC states derived using   k  \u2010means clustering. Participants transitioned between states on average about eight times (SD\u00a0=\u00a03.4) over the course of the 6\u2010min resting state scan. State 1 was the most frequently visited state, with 4955 (42%) centroid occurrences across the sample. State 1 was characterized by weaker covariance among ICs, which tended not to vary much over time except for the cingulo\u2010opercular  \u2010 frontoparietal  pair. In State 2 (17%, or 2025 centroid occurrences), participants showed widespread positive timecourse correlation among all four network components, with covariance between default  and cingulo\u2010opercular  being relatively more stable across time. State 3 (22%, or 2557 centroid occurrences) featured default  anticorrelation with cingulo\u2010opercular  and frontoparietal  components, which were positively correlated with each other. State 4 (19%, or 2243 centroid occurrences) differed from State 3 in that default  remained anticorrelated with frontoparietal  but was positively correlated with cingulo\u2010opercular , and cingulo\u2010opercular  was negatively correlated with frontoparietal . \n  \n K  \u2010means clustering applied to windowed covariance matrices (averaged over sessions) yielded four discrete \u201cstates,\u201d or patterns of functional network configuration. Colors indicate correlation strength and direction. Black outline indicates significantly more variation in the pair's covariance compared to the centroid median (i.e., one\u2010sample   t  \u2010test), pFDR\u00a0=\u00a0.05. State 1 shows weaker and less variable covariance among ICs. State 2 shows widespread positive correlations among all four network components, with covariance between default  and cingulo\u2010opercular  being relatively more stable across time. State 3 shows default  anticorrelation with both cingulo\u2010opercular  and frontoparietal  components, which were positively correlated with each other. State 4 differed from State 3 in that default  remained anticorrelated with frontoparietal  but was positively correlated with cingulo\u2010opercular , and cingulo\u2010opercular  was negatively correlated with frontoparietal  in State 4 \n  \n####  dFNC   metrics \n  \nMetrics of interest for this study were   dwell time  , or the average duration that an individual stays in a given state before transitioning to a different state, and   total number of transitions   (  n transitions  ), or the number of times an individual moves in and out of different states across the duration of the scan. We calculated these variables for each participant/session based on the results of the   k  \u2010means clustering. \n\n\n\n### Statistical analyses: Approach \n  \nAll analyses described in this section were conducted in R version 1.4.1717 (R Core Team,  ). Because this was an initial pilot study, we did not correct for multiple comparisons based on the number of statistical tests. However, we sought to minimize the number of comparisons where possible (e.g., through the feature selection approach described below). \n\n####  FNC   variables \n  \nWe selected a subset of model\u2010related network pairs from the static FNC output. Pairs involving IC17 (frontoparietal ) were not included as the spatial map for that component showed residual eye movement\u2010related artifact. In addition, our theoretical model based on Christoff et al. ( ) had no specific prediction about the relationship between default  and frontoparietal networks, so this pair was not included in any analyses. This left eight network pairs: (1) default  \u2013 default , (2) default  \u2013 cingulo\u2010opercular , (3) default  \u2013 cingulo\u2010opercular , (4) default  \u2013 cingulo\u2010opercular , (5) default  \u2013 cingulo\u2010opercular , (6) frontoparietal  \u2013 default , (7) frontoparietal  \u2013 cingulo\u2010opercular , (8) frontoparietal  \u2013 cingulo\u2010opercular . Additionally, we had five dFNC variables: dwell time in States 1\u20134, and   n   transitions. \n\n\n#### Covariates \n  \nAge and sex can influence functional connectivity (e.g., Damoiseaux,  ) and intranasal oxytocin response (e.g., Ebner et al.,\u00a0 ; Jiang et al.,\u00a0 ). BDI\u2010II total scores were included as a third covariate, as people with more prolonged grief symptoms tended to endorse more symptoms on the depression measure. Finally, we included pre\u2010scan state positive and negative affect (PANAS\u2010NA, PANAS\u2010PA), mean framewise displacement in each session, and psychoactive medication use as other variables that could be related both to ICG score and FNC. \n\n\n#### Feature selection \n  \nPrior to testing our hypotheses, we used a data\u2010driven method to select variables for inclusion in the subsequent analyses (described in the Results section). Specifically, we leveraged elastic net regression (Zou & Hastie,\u00a0 ) to identify variables that were robustly related to ICG score, given many candidate FNC variables (  n  \u00a0=\u00a013) and covariates (=7). In standard multiple regression, OLS parameter estimates are highly variable and thus less reliable in models with too many or correlated variables and smaller   n  , as in our data. Regularized regression approaches such as LASSO (L1 regularization) and ridge (L2 regularization) reduce this variance but at the cost of increasing bias in the coefficient estimates. Elastic net regression is a third form of regularization that seeks to find the optimal tradeoff between bias and variance, which should reduce overfitting and increase out\u2010of\u2010sample predictive accuracy even for smaller data sets. Elastic net regression is useful for data\u2010driven feature selection as it shrinks coefficients to zero for variables that are not robustly related to the outcome variable. \n\nWe used the glmnet package in R (Friedman et al.,\u00a0 ) to run a 10\u2010fold cross\u2010validated elastic net with grid search across values of alpha values in .002 increments (0\u00a0=\u00a0ridge and LASSO\u00a0=\u00a01) and lambda values to identify parameters of the minimum\u2010MSE model using the placebo\u2010session data. The model with smallest MSE included nonzero coefficients for six of the 20 independent variables: (1) BDI\u2010II, (2) state negative affect, (3) sex, (4, 5) two static FNC variables (default  \u2013 cingulo\u2010opercular  FNC, default  \u2013 cingulo\u2010opercular  FNC), and (6) one dFNC variable (mean dwell time in State 2),   r  \u00a0=\u00a00.70, indicating that those variables were robustly related to ICG scores. Note that, the regularized regression approach used here does not generate conventional statistics for NHST (e.g.,   p   values); the subsequent analyses provide NHST statistics characterizing the relationship between ICG scores and the \u201csparse model\u201d variables. \n\n\n#### Static   FNC  \n  \nFor our first aim (  is FNC associated with prolonged grief severity  ?), we used multiple linear regression predicting ICG score from the two static FNC variables (default  \u2013 cingulo\u2010opercular , default  \u2013 cingulo\u2010opercular ) and three covariates (BDI\u2010II, state negative affect, sex) to test whether higher prolonged grief symptoms were associated with FNC between default and cingulo\u2010opercular networks. Because the frontoparietal  \u2013 cingulo\u2010opercular  FNC variable was   not   retained during feature selection, we did not conduct further analyses examining FNC in this pair. \n\nFor our second aim (  does intranasal oxytocin moderate the relationship between FNC and prolonged grief symptoms  ?), we used linear mixed effects models with restricted maximum likelihood, which involved session (oxytocin/placebo) and ICG score as fixed effects, random effect of participant, correlation coefficient between a given network pair as outcome, and the same three covariates. We ran two models, examining cingulo\u2010opercular  FNC with default  and default . For each component pair, Model 1 included only fixed effects of ICG score and Session (placebo/oxytocin) with random effect of participant. Model 2 added BDI\u2010II score, state negative affect, and sex as additional fixed effects. \n\n\n#### Dynamic   FNC  \n  \nWe used similar multiple regression and linear mixed effects models as described above but with dwell time in State 2 as the outcome for the mixed effects model, rather than static FNC. \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Participant characteristics \n  \nThe sample (  n  \u00a0=\u00a038; Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ) were primarily female, retired, non\u2010Hispanic White adults, 36 of whom had been in heterosexual partnerships. Most had been in multi\u2010decade relationships and participated more than 1 year after their partner's death. Males were overrepresented in the sample high\u2010prolonged grief symptoms group (i.e., ICG \u226525;   n  \u00a0=\u00a015) relative to those with low prolonged grief symptoms (ICG <25;   n  \u00a0=\u00a023), but other characteristics (e.g., age, relationship duration, time since death, race, ethnicity, and presence of psychoactive medication use) were similar. \n  \nParticipant characteristics \n    \n\n### Static   FNC   results \n  \n#### Associations between   FNC   and prolonged grief symptoms \n  \nFunctional connectivity between DN  and cingulo\u2010opercular  components (as an independent variable) was statistically significantly associated with ICG scores (dependent variable) in the placebo session data,   b  \u00a0=\u00a010.85, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[0.67, 21.02], SE\u00a0=\u00a05,   t  \u00a0=\u00a02.17,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.037, as were two covariates: male sex,   b  \u00a0=\u00a08.27, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[2.91, 13.62], SE\u00a0=\u00a02.63,   t  \u00a0=\u00a03.14,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.004, and BDI\u2010II score,   b  \u00a0=\u00a01.03, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[0.59, 1.47], SE\u00a0=\u00a00.22,   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.78,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001. The independent variable for DN  \u2010cingulo\u2010opercular  functional connectivity was not statistically significant in the model,   b  \u00a0=\u00a06.61, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[\u22120.69, 13.92], SE\u00a0=\u00a03.59,   t  \u00a0=\u00a01.84,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.074, nor was the covariate for state negative affect,   b  \u00a0=\u00a00.43, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[\u22120.56, 1.41], SE\u00a0=\u00a00.48,   t  \u00a0=\u00a00.88,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.385). The overall model with covariates explained approximately two\u2010thirds of the variance in ICG scores (F(5,32)\u00a0=\u00a017.10, adjusted   R  \u00a0=\u00a00.69,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0<.001. \n\n\n#### Effects of intranasal oxytocin and prolonged grief symptoms on   FNC  \n  \nWhen we tested joint effects of intranasal oxytocin and prolonged grief symptoms (independent variables) on FNC (dependent variable), default  \u2013 cingulo\u2010opercular  was the only component pair with a significant difference between the oxytocin and placebo sessions. Specifically, their FNC was higher in the oxytocin session (Table\u00a0 ; Figure\u00a0 ). The effect of oxytocin remained after including BDI\u2010II score, sex, and state negative affect as covariates in the model. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no ICG score x Session interaction. Oxytocin had no apparent effect, alone or interaction, on FNC between default  \u2013 cingulo\u2010opercular  components (Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n### Dynamic   FNC   results \n  \n#### Associations between   dFNC   and prolonged grief symptoms \n  \nDwell time in State 2 (independent variable) was positively associated with ICG scores (dependent variable) in the placebo session data,   b  \u00a0=\u00a00.2, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[0, 0.41], SE\u00a0=\u00a00.1,   t  \u00a0=\u00a02.05,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.049 \u2013 along with the covariates male sex,   b  \u00a0=\u00a06.56, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[0.64, 12.48], SE\u00a0=\u00a02.91,   t  \u00a0=\u00a02.25,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.031, and BDI\u2010II score,   b  \u00a0=\u00a00.94, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[0.5, 1.38], SE\u00a0=\u00a00.22,   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.33,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001. State negative affect was not statistically significant when included as a covariate,   b  \u00a0=\u00a00.62, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[\u22120.4, 1.64], SE\u00a0=\u00a00.5,   t  \u00a0=\u00a01.24,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.225. The overall model with covariates explained about two\u2010thirds of the variance,   F  (4,33)\u00a0=\u00a018.12, adjusted   R  \u00a0=\u00a00.65, and   p  \u2009<\u2009.001. \n\n\n#### Effects of intranasal oxytocin and prolonged grief symptoms on   dFNC  \n  \nWhen we tested joint effects of intranasal oxytocin and prolonged grief symptoms (independent variables) on dFNC State 2 (dependent variable), we identified that intranasal oxytocin did not significantly impact dwell time in State 2 (Figure\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ). The association between higher ICG scores and longer State 2 dwell time remained statistically significant in the combined oxytocin+placebo session data, but contrary to our hypothesis, there was no ICG score \u00d7 Session interaction. \n  \nMean dwell time in each dynamic functional connectivity state, by group and session. Participants with high prolonged grief symptoms (ICG score\u2009\u2265\u200925) group spent more time in State 2 than those with low prolonged grief symptoms (ICG score\u2009<\u200925), across both oxytocin + placebo sessions \n  \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \n### Summary and implications \n  \nThe present study aimed to identify effects of prolonged grief symptoms and intranasal oxytocin on large\u2010scale brain network connectivity during resting state, using a data\u2010driven approach for network detection. We identified a network pair (default  and cingulo\u2010opercular ) in which higher resting state functional connectivity in the placebo session was associated with fewer prolonged grief symptoms. Intranasal oxytocin increased functional connectivity in the same similar circuit (default  and cingulo\u2010opercular ), though the effect of oxytocin was not moderated by prolonged grief symptoms (contrary to our hypothesis). \n\nThe default  and cingulo\u2010opercular  components both involve structures in which OXTR mRNA is highly expressed (Quintana et al.,  ). Similar to our findings, an earlier gICA study found that intranasal oxytocin increased resting state functional connectivity between networks identified as \u201csalience network \u201d and \u201cventral posterior default network\u201d in healthy adults (Xin et al.,\u00a0 ), with the unthresholded spatial map for their ventral posterior default network closely resembling the component labeled as \u201cdefault \u201d in our study. Although our theoretical model focused on the salience network, we ultimately labeled the putatively salience\u2010related components in terms of their anatomy (i.e., as part of the cingulo\u2010opercular network) rather than presumed function. The labels \u201csalience network\u201d and \u201ccingulo\u2010opercular network\u201d are often used interchangeably, and both appear to be largely anchored in the dorsal ACC and anterior insula. However, they may in fact represent distinct, though closely located networks that serve different functions. The salience network connectivity is involved in bottom\u2010up stimulus capture, whereas the cingulo\u2010opercular network is involved in attentional switching and maintenance to facilitate cognitive control via frontoparietal network connectivity (Power et al.,  ). The distinction between the two networks is an important one for prolonged grief, as Power et al. ( ) description of cingulo\u2010opercular network function seems more relevant than bottom\u2010up stimulus processing in exploring how bereaved people regulate the focus of their thoughts. The spatial maps labeled in the present study as \u201cdefault\u201d and \u201ccingulo\u2010opercular\u201d also resemble meta\u2010analytic correlates of transdiagnostic perseverative thought, with dACC and precuneus activation differentiating clinical and healthy control groups (Makovac et al.  ), though we note that our findings implicate the medial temporal default network subsystem rather than the mPFC/precuneus/posterior cingulate core default network. Together, these findings may further support (1) prolonged grief as a syndrome in which prolonged salience of the deceased/their death and unconstrained thought (perhaps involving autobiographical memories) are mutually reinforcing, and (2) a possible role for oxytocin in brain regions linked to prolonged grief symptoms (Arizmendi et al.,\u00a0 ; Kakarala et al.,\u00a0 ). However, we note that our prediction that prolonged grief symptoms would be associated with   less   variability in dFNC as measured by lower   n   transitions was not supported by these data. Also contrary to our hypothesis, intranasal oxytocin did not have a differential effect on participants with higher prolonged grief symptoms during resting state. The relationship requires further probing given that oxytocin did have differential effects on behavior in the same sample (Arizmendi et al.,\u00a0 ): oxytocin slowed overall response times in high\u2010 (but not low\u2010) prolonged grief symptom groups. \n\nThere was no apparent effect of intranasal oxytocin on dynamic functional connectivity, matching recent findings from younger healthy samples in which oxytocin did not modulate dwell time or number of transitions (Jiang et al.,\u00a0 ). However, consistent with our hypothesis that people with higher prolonged grief symptoms would experience greater automatic (i.e., emotional) constraints over their thoughts during resting state, we found that participants with higher levels of prolonged grief symptoms displayed longer dwell time in a dynamic state characterized by both intra\u2010 and inter\u2010default network coupling (State 2). Longer dwell time in State 2 might reflect the tendency for people with prolonged grief to get \u201cstuck\u201d in grief\u2010related thoughts\u2014particularly after confronting reminders of the deceased, which they did in the task preceding resting state scanning in our study. For example, emotional content was reflected in a dFNC pattern featuring extensive network interconnectivity during unconstrained thought (Wang et al.,\u00a0 ), and negative emotional content in the preceding task led to greater default network coactivation (Gaviria et al.,\u00a0 ). Reduced anticorrelation between salience and default networks may reflect off\u2010task intrusions (Kucyi et al.,\u00a0 ). Higher default network connectivity has also been linked to more vivid memory (Turnbull et al.,  ), and autobiographical memory retrieval is associated with increased correlation between default network and distributed nondefault network regions (Warren et al.,\u00a0 ), which fits with the DN  and cingulo\u2010opercular  FNC seen in our study. Deceased\u2010related mental representations interfere with ongoing attention (Freed et al.,\u00a0 ; Schneck et al.,\u00a0 ), though may be adaptive if processing does not rise to the level of conscious awareness and the thoughts are not experienced as intrusive (Schneck et al.,\u00a0 ). In contrast, prolonged grief involves aspects of both automatic (intrusions) and deliberate constraints on thought (cognitive avoidance via rumination or suppression). Although we did not find any association between prolonged grief symptoms and static FNC in the right frontoparietal network component, its internetwork connectivity in the dFNC State 2 might reflect efforts in bereaved people to monitor and guide mental activity. Indeed, this network component resembles a cognitive control\u2010related subnetwork involved in regulating internal thoughts and emotions (vs. regulating external attention) through interactions with the default network (Dixon et al.  ). \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nOur results should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, many of our findings are modest and exploratory (despite clear theory\u2010driven hypotheses) and we did not correct for the total number of statistical tests. Data presented here are cross\u2010sectional, so we cannot identify whether differences in static and dynamic functional connectivity represents a trait vulnerability or reflect the instantiation of processes involved in poorer adaptation\u2014a consequence or correlate, rather than a determinant of risk for prolonged grief. In terms of design limitations, the sample of White older adults was not representative of the population\u2010level demographics of United States widows (Granek and Peleg\u2010Sagy,  ), the parent study did not include ongoing thought assessment during resting state, which would strengthen the interpretation of the function of identified networks, and the placement of resting state after a behavioral task that included photos of the deceased could have influenced the resting state activity (though whether that influence would be desirable or undesirable is debatable). \n\nThere are also several important methodological caveats to consider, given outstanding questions and controversies in the field around methodological, statistical, and biological considerations in studying intranasal oxytocin effects, and/or time\u2010varying functional connectivity as it relates to the brain as a dynamic system (Lurie et al.,  ). Although 24\u2009IU is one of the more common supraphysiologic oxytocin doses used for human research, there is mixed evidence for which dose elicits the strongest effects (e.g., 8\u2009IU vs. 24\u2009IU) and how the uptake of intranasal oxytocin could be affected by individual differences in nasal cavity physiology and thus efficacy of administration (Quintana et al., 2021). There is also mixed evidence for how long the acute effects of neural and behavioral effects of intranasal oxytocin last. One study of resting state cerebral blood flow changes in response to intranasal oxytocin versus placebo identified a pharmacodynamic peak at the 39\u201351\u2009min period; however, the effect of oxytocin was sustained across the full 78\u2010min duration of the study (Paloyelis et al.,  ). Participants in this study began the resting state scan at 68\u2009min on average, and it is possible that the null effects on dFNC in the present study were a consequence of the later timing or using an improper dosage. \n\nDynamic (time\u2010varying) functional connectivity measures may suffer from undesirably low test\u2013retest reliability (Choe et al. 2017; Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ), which is particularly relevant in the context of our repeated\u2010measures study design. However, cortical networks, particular default and frontoparietal, do seem to be more reliable than subcortical networks (Noble et al.,  ). Both structural and functional brain connectivity measures have been critiqued for sensitivity to motion and physiological artifacts so to mitigate potential for spurious correlations, we used ICA\u2010AROMA (Pruim, Mennes, Rooij, et al.  ; Pruim, Mennes, Buitelaar, et al.  ), which performs better than standard motion parameter regression with less data loss than volume censoring (Parkes et al.,  ). Dynamic functional connectivity estimation may be influenced by parameters such as sliding window length and cut\u2010off frequency (Leonardi & Van De Ville,  ). This issue is complicated by the fact that we do not know the ground truth for issues like \u201cHow long does a thought last?\u201d (and thus, what is the most accurate window length?) Longer window lengths may obscure briefer changes, and vice versa. For our data, potential sliding window lengths lay between 100 and 6.67\u2009s (based on the lowest and highest frequencies of interest at 0.01\u20130.15\u2009Hz), but window lengths of 30\u2009s and above may be optimal for the tapered sliding window approach used here (Xie et al.,\u00a0 ), though our 44\u2010s window could miss any very slow dynamics (i.e., between 0.01 and 023\u2009Hz). We chose the 22\u2010TR window (44\u2009s) following Allen et al. ( ) observation that 44\u2009s achieved a good tradeoff between the ability to resolve dynamics and covariance matrix estimation quality. Finally, varying the value of   k   in the   k  \u2010means clustering approach might have yielded different results. Here, we selected   k   using a mathematical criterion (given our lack of principled empirical predictions for how many states \u201cshould\u201d be expected), which Allen et al. ( ) showed to provide results consistent with those across a wide range of   k  . However, testing whether results replicated across a range of parameter values would have inspired greater confidence in our findings. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nThis study illustrates differences in static and dynamic resting state functional connectivity measures in bereaved older adults representing a wide range of prolonged grief symptoms. Higher prolonged grief symptoms were associated with increased inter\u2010network functional connectivity, particularly between retrosplenial default and cingulo\u2010opercular network regions. The same retrosplenial default cingulo\u2010opercular was sensitive to intranasal oxytocin manipulation. Though modest, our data support the idea that both brain network connectivity and the neuropeptide oxytocin may play roles in prolonged grief. The observed effect of oxytocin on default network \u2013 cingulo\u2010opercular network static functional connectivity in our bereaved sample is intriguing given theoretical conceptualizations of reward in prolonged grief disorder (Kakarala et al.,\u00a0 ). However, it is important to emphasize that intranasal oxytocin was used here as a mechanistic probe: this study is not equipped to study the therapeutic value of intranasal oxytocin, nor does it establish a rationale for using intranasal oxytocin to treat prolonged grief symptoms. Future studies should seek to establish whether the functional connectivity differences observed here replicate in younger bereaved adults, whether they are present pre\u2010morbidly or only following loss, and if they reflect specific mental processes (e.g., differences in thought form or content) in people experiencing prolonged grief. Given that grief adaptation is a process that unfolds over time (across both long\u2010 and short\u2010term scales), dynamic functional connectivity remains an intriguing tool but would be most informative in the context of careful study design that can capture ongoing changes in subjective experience. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nMary\u2010Frances O'Connor conceptualized, designed the parent study, obtained grant funding, and data collection.
