We compared the distribution of the ASD and TD groups' volumes in CAPs as well as their voxel\u2010wise means. For simplification purposes, we conducted a group independent component analysis to extract 14 major RSNs. The RSNs' average   z  \u2010scores enabled us to meaningfully regroup the RSNs and estimate the percentage of voxels within each RSN for which there was a significant group difference. These results were jointly interpreted to find global group\u2010specific patterns. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe found similar brain state proportions in 58 CAPs (clustering interval from 2 to 30). However, in many CAPs, the voxel\u2010wise means differed significantly within a matrix of 14 RSNs. The rest\u2010activated default mode\u2010positive and default mode\u2010negative brain state properties vary considerably in both groups over time. This division was seen clearly when the volumes were partitioned into two CAPs and then further examined along the HC dendrogram of the diversifying brain CAPs. The ASD group network activations followed a more heterogeneous distribution and some networks maintained higher baselines; throughout the brain deactivation state, the ASD participants had reduced deactivation in 12/14 networks. During default mode\u2010negative CAPs, the ASD group showed simultaneous visual network and either dorsal attention or default mode network overactivation. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nNonsequential volume gathering into CAPs and the comparison of voxel\u2010wise signal changes provide a complementary perspective to connectivity and an alternative to sliding window analysis. \n\n  \nCo\u2010activation patterns (CAPs) of resting state brain activity varyingly contain both default mode network (DMN)\u2010positive and default mode network\u2010negative brain state properties. With hierarchical clustering, they can be divided into shorter substates. When applied in autism spectrum disorder, this method showed simultaneous visual network and either dorsal attention or DMN overactivation during DMN\u2010negative CAPs. Nonsequential volume gathering into CAPs provides an alternative to sliding window analysis.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nAccording to the latest draft of WHO's International Classification of Diseases, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is usually a pervasive but contextually varying feature of an individual's functioning observed in all settings: for example, personal, family, social, educational, and occupational interactions. ASD is characterized by persistent deficits in one's ability to initiate and sustain reciprocal social interaction and social communication, as well as by a range of restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behavior and interests (World Health Organization,\u00a0 ). Subjects with ASD prefer to focus on only a restricted number of repeating and controllable sensory information instead of the subtle and irregular cues of multisensory information needed in social communication. The etiology and expression of ASD are highly diverse, and the recent changes in the diagnostic criteria from categorical to dimensional reflect this growing understanding (Betancur,\u00a0 ; Lord & Jones,\u00a0 ; Mattila et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Park et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Varghese et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Waye & Cheng,\u00a0 ). \n\nResting state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examines spontaneous brain function by using blood oxygen level\u2010dependent (BOLD) contrast in the absence of a task. Traditionally, RS\u2010fMRI analysis has relied on a temporally stationary functional connectivity (FC) measure, in which the correlations between the voxel time series of brain regions are examined as unchanging over time. Previously, ASD has been affiliated with altered RS intrinsic FC, and the literature supports a diffuse pattern of both, rather than only under\u2010 or overconnectivity. Even a recent, thorough review of RS FC in ASD with nearly 70 analysis citations found it challenging to draw direct conclusions about the nature of FC in ASD (Hull et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Since the seminal work of Chang and Glover ( ), the last decade has seen a growing trend and a deliberate effort to characterize dynamic changes in brain connectivity as a function of time, dynamic FC (dFC) or time\u2010varying FC (TVFC). The most widely used temporal sliding window approaches to between\u2010voxel correlations have demonstrated that FC in the brain has time\u2010varying properties (Allen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Chang & Glover,\u00a0 ; Hutchison et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Kiviniemi et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Lurie et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Preti et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). It has been suggested that greater intraindividual dynamic variance is a potential biomarker of not only ASD but also mental disorders such as schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and that it may underlie confusing static FC measures (Chen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Falahpour et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Zhang et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). It is also important to recognize that the same static FC pattern could result from many different combinations or sequences of shorter spatiotemporal patterns of underlying TVFC (Lurie et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nOf the existing TVFC methods, the co\u2010activation pattern (CAP) approach deviates from conventional time\u2010domain approaches by regarding single fMRI volumes at individual time points, instead of fMRI time courses, as the basic units of analysis (Liu et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Hindriks et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ) suggest that CAPs could be the building blocks of spontaneous BOLD activity and that dFC is a reflection of these. As Tagliazucchi et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ) state: \"Instead of asking whether two voxels are engaged in synchronized fluctuations over a relatively long period of time, the question is shifted to whether two voxels become jointly activated (i.e., present high activity above their baseline levels) and what are the timings and properties of these co\u2010activations.\" The beginning of the development of CAP analysis can be traced to when Tagliazucchi et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ) established their point process analysis and observed that the timing of high\u2010activity events in BOLD signals allows the reconstruction of major RS networks (RSNs). Soon after, Liu and Duyn ( ) applied K\u2010means clustering to arrange single fMRI volumes into groups and averaged this data group\u2010wise to produce distinct spatial CAPs. Related studies have been conducted by other groups using CAP (Bolton et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Chen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Di Perri et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Zhuang et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; recent CAP review by Liu et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) or other terms such as coincident threshold crossings (Hudetz et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) and modes (Li et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nConstellations of different intrinsic connectivity network (ICN) patterns have previously been referred to as brain states (Allen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Although in our study, CAPs are not calculated as time\u2010varying FC matrix representations as illustrated by Allen et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ), they can be seen as representing the same brain states, as a timeline of various spatiotemporal clusters of (de)activation patterns of independent RSNs (Preti et\u00a0al.\u00a0 ). These brain states are visualized as a mean image of multiple volumes (Figure  ) in which RSNs (Figure  ) are in sufficiently similar phases of activation as determined by a clustering algorithm. If the number of states or CAPs depicting the same data is increased, the amount of time for which one CAP is represented grows proportionately shorter. In CAP analysis, the gathered volumes do not have to be sequential, and voxel signal levels per se can be evaluated. These two issues present the major differences from most sliding window TVFC analyses (Liu et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Lurie et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Preti et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). \n  \nHierarchical clustering result dendrogram. Top, hierarchical clustering (cosine distance, Ward's method) result dendrogram of 11,930 resting state (RS) fMRI volumes of 55 adolescent participants. The   x  \u2010axis shows the study\u2010specific distances between the clusters as height h. When h\u00a0=\u00a00, each volume forms its own cluster, and h\u22483.48 (dashed blue line on the right) corresponds to splitting the volumes into 30 clusters. Due to image resolution limitations, the volumes were merged as the thickened black column on the   y  \u2010axis. The lower part of the figure highlights the cluster levels from 02 to 30 as a cladogram, which shows the relations between the CAPs. The first number indicates the total cluster count at that level. The second number was determined by the clustering algorithm that showed the cluster's ordinal number for only that hierarchical level. For the sake of visualization, in the cladogram, the branch lengths have been scaled equal, as opposed to a dendrogram. Each CAP's   z  \u2010statistic map slice is shown from the same level of anterior and dorsal nodes of the default mode network (DMN). The lower DMN\u2010negative or \"task\u2010positive\" branches of the cladogram comprise 4,658 volumes (39%), and the upper DMN\u2010positive branches 7,272 volumes (61% of the whole data) of the RS\u2010fMRI data. Further CAP volume distributions (Figures\u00a0 a\u2010b) are detailed in Appendix\u00a0 . The   z  \u2010statistic color keys range from \u221220 to \u22123.5 and from 3.5 to 20 \n    \nStudy\u2010specific cores of 14 resting state networks (FSL MELODIC group ICA components). The components are ordered column\u2010wise according to the explained variance. Overlapping areas were removed by assigning each voxel to only one IC, where it had the highest absolute   z  \u2010statistic over the other ICs. The component areas were only used as voxel\u2010wise masks and a simple atlas to label brain areas when interpreting CAP results. Images of the combined 14 components and study mask are also displayed. The   z  \u2010statistic color key ranges from 0 (black) to 14 (white) \n  \nFrom the CAP methods, the following can be distinguished 1) seed\u2010based methods (e.g., Amico et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Chen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Di Perri et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Liu & Duyn,\u00a0 ), in which the volumes for analysis are selected via predefined seed voxel or region thresholds and in which interactions with the rest of the brain are probed, and 2) seed\u2010free analyses, such as ours, in which the clustering algorithm is applied to all volumes in an entirely data\u2010driven way (e.g., Bolton et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Liu et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ,  ). Another relevant distinction between studies is that most earlier studies have focused on temporal properties or CAP metrics, such as the occurrence rate, dwell time, and transition probability (e.g., Bolton et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Chen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), whereas the most salient findings in our study concentrate on the spatial differences across the groups (also see Amico et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Di Perri et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nIn CAP analysis, BOLD fMRI volumes are described by their voxels' signal amplitudes, and their relation to other volumes can be defined via a suitable function, such as the Pearson correlation coefficient (Chen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Di Perri et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Li et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Liu & Duyn,\u00a0 ; Yao et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) or cosine distance (Karahano\u011flu & Van De Ville,  ). fMRI studies have utilized hierarchical clustering methods with a voxel\u2010wise approach (Liu et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Thirion et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Wang & Li,\u00a0 ; Wang et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) and with FC analysis (Kam et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Agglomerative algorithms are deterministic and do not require a predetermined number of clusters (as opposed to k\u2010means clustering). To decide which data objects (here fMRI volumes) are combined during hierarchical clustering, we chose Ward's method. This belongs to minimum variance methods and uses one variant of the Lance\u2013Williams dissimilarity update formula, sharing the total error sum of squares criterion with k\u2010means clustering (Murtagh & Legendre,\u00a0 ). \n\nAs individual CAPs reflect the continuous flow of time\u2010varying information within functional brain networks (Liu et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), we wanted to study whether the effects of restricted, narrow focusing of attention to limited information sources typical to ASD can be detected in the clustering of CAP information. To determine possible CAP differences between adolescents with ASD and typically developing (TD) controls, we compared the distribution of the ASD and TD groups' volumes in CAPs as well as their voxel\u2010wise means. This enabled us to determine the specific differences between the (de)activation patterns of the two groups. The number of CAPs in earlier studies ranges from 4 (Li et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) to 30 (Liu et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), and we addressed this range accordingly. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Dataset \n  \nThe study population, detailed diagnostic criteria, and all the data were the same as those used by Paakki et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ). As fMRI preprocessing methods have advanced, in the present study, we utilized them as described below. \n\nThe study population consisted of 55 adolescents, of which 28 had ASD (with normal IQ, age 14.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.62\u00a0years, 20 males, 8 females, three left\u2010handed) according to ICD\u201010 research criteria (World Health Organization,\u00a0 ) and 27 were TD\u2010matched controls (age 14.49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.51\u00a0years, 18 males, 9 females, two left\u2010handed). The MR data were collected using a GE 1.5\u00a0T Signa HDX scanner with an eight\u2010channel parallel imaging head coil. Before the scan, the participants were asked to lie still, remain relaxed and awake, and look at a white cross in the middle of a dark\u2010gray screen. The 7.5\u00a0min RS BOLD fMRI scanning consisted of 253 whole brain volumes. The parameters of the gradient\u2010recalled echo\u2010planar imaging (GRE EPI) were as follows: TR 1.8\u00a0s, TE 40\u00a0ms, flip angle 90\u00b0, FOV 256\u00a0mm, 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064 in\u2010plane matrix, 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0mm voxel size, and 28 oblique axial slices with a 0.4\u00a0mm gap and interleaved acquisition order. We acquired the structural data using a T1\u2010weighted 3D FSPGR sequence with 1\u00a0mm oblique axial slices, FOV 24.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a024.0\u00a0cm with a 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256 matrix. \n\nAll participants and their parents gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of the Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Preprocessing of RS\u2010fMRI signals \n  \nFor anatomical data, we used FSL\u2010VBM FNIRT to register individual T1 structural head volumes and generate a study\u2010specific template (Andersson et al.,  ; Douaud et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Good et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Smith et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). After skull stripping, the FSL's FIRST segmented cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter (WM), and gray matter (GM) (Patenaude et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nFor the functional data, AFNI's (Cox,\u00a0 ; Cox & Hyde,\u00a0 ; Gold et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) \"afni_proc.py\" program produced preprocessing pipeline according to the program's help page examples 9b and 10 ( ) and following the guidelines of Jo et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ). We removed the first three volumes to avoid T1 effects and computed the outlier fractions for each volume. Motion correction was applied, and the skull was stripped. Exploiting the results of our earlier FSL\u2010VBM procedure and the study\u2010specific average template, we applied a nonlinear transformation to functional data. \n\nAfter these steps, we interrupted the AFNI pipeline and ran the independent component (IC) analysis\u2010based automatic removal of motion artifacts (ICA\u2010AROMA) for the functional data. The median number of ICs left after artifact removal was 14.5 in ASD and 13 in the TD group (Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum test   p  \u2010value\u00a0=\u00a0.41). The nonaggressive option was implemented in the participant\u2010wise removal of artifact components (Pruim et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Pruim, Mennes, van Rooij, et al.,  ). \n\nThe AFNI pipeline continued with despiking. The volumes with a displacement of >0.2\u00a0mm or with a normalized signal level of over 1.29 (outlying 10% of expected   SD  ) were labeled for censoring (Aurich et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Nichols,\u00a0 ; Power et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ,  ). On average, 13.2% (min. 0%, max. 45.6%) of the time series were censored. The shortest time left was 4\u00a0min 5\u00a0s, which was still considered adequate (White et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). After censoring, 13,750 volumes were reduced to 11,930: The TD participants had an average of 223 volumes, and the ASD participants 210 volumes left (Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum   p  \u2010value\u00a0=\u00a0.34). \n\nFor full details on preprocessing, Appendix\u00a0 . We did not regress the global signal. We performed spatial smoothing with 8\u00a0mm (~2 voxels) full width at half maximum kernel (Chen & Calhoun,\u00a0 ) and calculated high pass temporal filtering regressors for frequencies of <.005\u00a0Hz. Removal of trends, censoring, temporal filtering, motion, once eroded CSF mask, and local WM (ANATICOR) regressors were combined into a regression matrix with AFNI 3dDeconvolve and projected out of the smoothed data in one step with the AFNI 3dTproject to remove any possible residual noise (Jo et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Group independent component analysis \n  \nWe created uncensored but otherwise similarly preprocessed datasets with FSL MELODIC multisession temporal concatenation analysis and estimated group\u2010level ICs. These were used as masks and a simple atlas to label brain areas when interpreting the CAP results. We adjusted the dimensionality to 14 ICs and chose the low dimensional approach for the sake of pragmatic visual pattern analysis, but still covered major networks in line with earlier studies (Castellazzi et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Smith et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Starck et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Thornburgh et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Yeo et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ,  ). \n\n\n### Hierarchical clustering and extraction of CAPs \n  \nThe preprocessing continued in MATLAB  (MathWorks , 2016; Shen,\u00a0 ). The fMRI signal was temporally normalized voxel\u2010wise for each participant by subtracting the mean and then dividing by the temporal   SD   (Liu et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). The individual datasets were masked using combined GICA components and GM voxels (Figure  ). These volumes and mask were later used with FSL randomise. \n\nThe volumes were reshaped and concatenated, and the resulting data matrix was transferred to the R environment (Bengtsson,\u00a0 ; R Core Team,\u00a0 ). We applied clustering to all the BOLD fMRI volumes acquired from the 55 participants that had survived censoring. As mentioned in the introduction, the volumes are described by their voxels' signal amplitudes, and their relation to other volumes has to be defined via a suitable function. Here, individual volumes were represented as 29,684\u2010dimensional vectors, and a matrix containing the pairwise cosine similarity among all the 11,930 vectors was calculated. \n\nAs we were interested in the spatial similarity of the volumes and the corresponding \"directionality\" of the voxels' signals (above or below average) rather than their absolute amplitude strength, we chose to use the cosine similarity, which is invariant to the scaling of the data. In other words, excluding anticorrelated patterns, we tried to prevent spatially similar patterns in different phases and with different signal amplitudes from going into different clusters. The Pearson correlation coefficient and cosine similarity are related measures, but the Pearson correlation is also invariant to adding any constant to all data elements, which we considered to possibly have a global signal regression (GSR) type of effect on clustering (Manning et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Murtagh & Contreras,\u00a0 ; Singhal,\u00a0 ). \n\nA cosine similarity matrix was converted to a distance matrix, as we performed hierarchical clustering using R fastcluster\u2010package function hclust (method\u00a0=\u00a0\"ward.D2\") (M\u00fcllner,\u00a0 ). The results from 30 to 2 clusters (in total, 58 clusters or CAPs) were evaluated. We aggregated the fMRI volumes assigned to each cluster. The mean image of such a cluster's volumes provided an overall view of the resulting CAP and was then normalized by the standard error (within\u2010cluster and across fMRI volumes) to generate   z  \u2010statistic maps, which quantify the degree of significance to which the CAP map values for each voxel deviate from zero (Liu et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ,  ). \n\n\n### Group comparison   t   tests \n  \nThe 11,930 RS\u2010fMRI volumes concatenated into one file were used as input for FSL's randomise (Anderson & Robinson,\u00a0 ; Winkler et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). The voxel\u2010wise differences between the ASD and TD groups were assessed for each CAP using two\u2010sample unpaired   t   tests (10,000 permutations). The design matrix for each hierarchy level included all the volumes as rows and all the clusters, that is, CAPs existing at that level of the hierarchy, as columns, with separate columns for the TD and ASD participants. We created within\u2010group and between\u2010group contrast files for the CAPs and used participant\u2010wise exchangeability block labels. The resulting threshold\u2010free cluster enhancement (TFCE) uncorrected   p  \u2010value maps were merged, and the false discovery rate (FDR) corrected across all the contrasts using FSL's fdr (q\u00a0=\u00a00.05), which gave a   p  \u2010value threshold of .004, corrected for two\u2010tailed results at   p  \u00a0<.002 (Anderson & Robinson,\u00a0 ; Benjamini & Hochberg,\u00a0 ; Genovese et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). We used MRIcron (Rorden & Brett,\u00a0 ) and R packages ape (Paradis & Schliep,\u00a0 ), dendextend (Galili,\u00a0 ), dendsort (Sakai et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), dplyr (Wickham et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), ggtree (Yu et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), ggplot2 (Wickham,\u00a0 ), gplots (Warnes et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), plyr (Wickham,\u00a0 ), and RColorBrewer (Neuwirth,\u00a0 ) to aid data visualization. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nThe median number of fMRI volumes assigned to each CAP from either the ASD or the TD participants' data was calculated with bootstrapped confidence intervals (95%, 10,000 resamples), which were overlapping (Figure  ). The Mann\u2013Whitney test   p  \u2010value was <.05 in seven CAPs but became nonsignificant after FDR correction. Thus, we found no reliable ASD\u2010 or TD\u2010specific CAPs within the cluster levels used in our study (from 2 to 30). The number of volumes in each CAP (Figures\u00a0 a\u2010b) and the images of each CAP (Figures\u00a0 a\u2010i), and when found, their group activation differences (Figures\u00a0 a\u2010i), are visualized in Appendix\u00a0 . \n  \nThe median number of fMRI volumes per subject in CAPs with confidence intervals and outlier dots. The outliers may reflect individual differences in time spent in default mode\u2010positive or task\u2010positive brain states. As described earlier, participant\u2010wise, censoring excluded on average 13 volumes more from the ASD data than from the TD data \n  \nThe clustering of the whole RS\u2010fMRI data reveals a familiar\u2010looking division into two main cluster groups. At the highest level of the cladogram (Figure  ), the first level of branching, there are only two CAPs, and each fMRI volume belongs to one or the other. The first CAP (02\u201301, 39% of the 11,930 volumes) resembles a task\u2010positive ICN as its fMRI volumes contain below\u2010average values in lateral visual, default mode, language, and frontoparietal cognitive control (FPC) networks, but above\u2010average values in dorsal attention (DAN), medial visual, somatosensory, motor, auditory, salience, and ventral attention (VAN) networks. The second CAP (02\u201302, 61% of the volumes) shows a reversal in the activity patterns with above\u2010average values in default mode network (DMN) and corresponding opposite values in other networks embodying task\u2010negative, or rather default mode\u2010positive ICN features, compared to the first CAP. \n\nBoth DMN\u2010positive and DMN\u2010negative (or task\u2010positive) CAPs divide into subhierarchies and smaller CAPs (Figure  ), which are distinguished from each other by different areal average values (also referred to here as activation when above average and deactivation when below average) in ICA\u2010based RSNs (Figure  ). This is also depicted in the heatmap of Figure  , which illustrates the average   z  \u2010score values of our study\u2010specific RSN parcellations in different CAPs. The hierarchical clustering of both rows and columns of this heatmap groups the different RSNs and CAPs by their features, respectively. This kind of review is modest in terms of spatial accuracy but facilitates pattern recognition in group\u2010level activation differences. The most obvious patterns are reported in the following paragraphs. \n  \nMean voxel\u2010wise   z  \u2010scores by resting state networks (as in Figure  ) for each CAP. On the   x   and   y   axes, the brain areas' grouping was determined by the hierarchical clustering (cosine distance, Ward's method) of only this particular   z  \u2010score matrix. On the   x  \u2010axis, the CAP label colors correspond to the \"DMN\u2010negative/task\u2010positive\" (blue labels, DMN\u2010CAPs) and \"DMN\u2010positive\" (red labels, DMN\u00a0+\u00a0CAPs) grouping of CAPs, with a thin black separating line between them. Network abbreviations: DAN\u00a0=\u00a0dorsal attention; Visual Med, Up Med, Lat\u00a0=\u00a0visual medial, upper medial, lateral; VAN\u2010P/\u2010A\u00a0=\u00a0ventral attention posterior/anterior; DMN\u2010V/\u2010D/\u2010A\u00a0=\u00a0default mode ventral/dorsal/anterior, FPC L/R\u00a0=\u00a0frontoparietal cognitive control left/right. Views: DAN, Visual (3D elevated occipital), Somatosensory, Motor, DMN\u2010A (3D above), Auditory, Salience, VAN, FPC R (3D right lateral), DMN\u2010V, \u2010D (axial slice above), DMN/Language, FPC L (3D left lateral) \n  \nWhen the CAPs in Figure   are transformed into the heatmap of Figure  , one can roughly detect four panels. Firstly, the DMN, language, and FPC networks exhibit mainly negative   z  \u2010scores (interpreted here as network deactivation) during the default mode\u2010negative CAPs (DMN\u2010CAPs) and form the bluish colored lower panel on the left, whereas the DAN and all the sensory, motor, salience, and VAN networks mostly exhibit red colored positive   z  \u2010scores (interpreted here as task\u2010positive network activation) and form the reddish left upper panel of the DMN\u2010CAPs. \n\nBut during the DMN\u2010positive CAPs (DMN\u00a0+\u00a0CAPs) on the right, the DMN, language, and FPC networks largely exhibit positive   z  \u2010scores and form the reddish right lower panel. Fourthly, the right upper panel of the DMN\u00a0+\u00a0CAPs consist for the most part, of blue colored negative   z  \u2010scores, excluding a few CAPs with activation among auditory, visual, salience, and VAN networks. \n\nDue to   z  \u2010score averaging, the nuances of the CAPs are lost in the heatmap, and a few seemingly similar CAPs coexist on both left and right. Notably, some CAPs also show only activation or deactivation over all the RSNs, that is, negative blue or positive red vertical stripes over the whole brain cortex matrix (Figures   and  ). \n  \nCombination of Figures   and  . Largest clusters (highest decile) of TD and ASD group\u2010related CAP activity in resting state networks. (a) The TD group\u2010related activity is marked by the letter \"T\" and (b) the ASD group\u2010related activity by \"A\" over the color\u2010coded average   z  \u2010scores of the same heatmap as those in Figure  \n  \nThe areas in the CAPs in which the TD or ASD group have significantly greater activation than the other group are shown as a percentage of the corresponding RSN volume in Figure  . The highlighted highest deciles of these results are projected on the earlier CAP heatmap (Figure  ). This combination in Figure   enables finding the RSNs in the CAPs that exhibit the largest simultaneous group\u2010related activations. The twenty largest between\u2010group differences in CAPs are listed in Table\u00a0 . Additional descriptive (Figures\u00a0 a\u2010b, Figures\u00a0 a\u2010i) and detailed results Table\u00a0  can be found in Appendix\u00a0  of this article and in Zenodo (Paakki et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), respectively. \n  \nPercentages of brain areas in CAPs in which the (a) TD and (b) ASD groups have significantly greater voxel\u2010wise   z  \u2010score values than the other group. The results are shown at q\u00a0=\u00a0.05 false discovery rate (FDR) corrected. An arbitrary threshold of the highest decile is applied to the cell background coloring (blue rectangles for TD, red for ASD) as a highlighting method, in which cluster areas comprise at least 19% of the corresponding IC areas. The order and origin of the   x  \u2010 and   y  \u2010axis labels are identical to those in Figure  \n    \nTwenty biggest CAP group differences in FSL randomise TFCE clusters (false discovery rate q\u00a0<\u00a00.05 corrected, two\u2010tailed FDR\u2010adjusted   p  \u2010value threshold   p  \u00a0=.002) and percentage of brain areas in each CAP and IC in which the ASD or TD groups had significantly greater values than the other group \n  \nWhen inspecting Figure   through the four\u2010panel approach described earlier, one can see that most of the largest TD group\u2010related activations fall within the task\u2010related networks in the upper left panel during the DMN\u2010CAPs. In contrast, during the DMN\u00a0+\u00a0CAPs, the TD group\u2010related activations are mostly within the DMN and the language and VAN networks. \n\nThe TD group\u2010related FPC activation was left\u2010dominant during the DMN\u2010CAPs and right\u2010dominant during the DMN\u00a0+\u00a0CAPs. The left FPC was activated, while the task\u2010related networks were also activated and seemed to associate with the salience and VAN\u2010A networks in particular, but also with the auditory, somatosensory, and DAN networks. Right FPC activation associated with the DMN and language networks. \n\nThe earlier described four\u2010panel approach generally showed more incoherently highlighted patterns during the ASD group\u2010related activations than the TD group\u2010related activations (Figures   and  ). The ASD group's FPC activations did not demonstrate clear\u2010cut sidedness related to the DMN\u2010negative or DMN\u2010positive CAPs. However, there were some repeating overactivation patterns. The DAN associated with the visual networks. If the visual network was overactive but not concurrent with the DAN, it associated in turn with the DMN. In the TD group, the DAN overactivation was also associated with other task\u2010positive networks in a more balanced way. It also seems that the ASD group did not quite reach as strong deactivations as the TD group (Figure  ). ASD group\u2010related overactivations were found especially in the DAN, visual and auditory networks, and the DMN. In the 06\u201306 CAP, which deactivated all 14 RSNs, the ASD group showed a considerably reduced deactivation pattern in nearly all (12/14) of the RSNs. \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \n### Study results and comparison to earlier studies \n  \nOur study provides complementary information and an alternative perspective to FC analysis by gathering nonsequentially brief instances of similar fMRI brain volumes into larger CAP clusters. This method may be especially beneficial before group comparisons in RS studies, in which no external synchronization is provided by tasks or stimuli. We found the DMN\u00a0+\u00a0CAPs and DMN\u2010CAPs (61% and 39% of the fMRI volumes, respectively) to be spatially similar in both TD and ASD groups as the clustering algorithm gathered volumes to each CAP from both groups without significant group\u2010wise differences in time spent in each CAP. However, the CAPs showed focused alterations of internal activity levels among many RSNs, including the following (Figures   and  ): \n\n1) ASD\u2010related activations during the DMN\u2010CAPs considerably affected the DMN, and during DMN\u00a0+\u00a0CAPs, other RSNs. \n\n2) The ASD group showed visual network overactivation during the DMN\u2010CAPs, which was simultaneous with the overactivation of either the DAN or the DMN. \n\n3) Autism spectrum disorder\u2010related FPC activations were incoherent and showed hemispherical shifts. \n\n4) The auditory, DMN, and language networks were overactivated in the ASD group during the RSN deactivations, which may indicate higher baseline activity in the ASD group. \n\nThe TD group\u2010related alterations can be assessed similarly: In general, the TD group showed greater activation in the task\u2010positive RSNs during the DMN\u2010CAPs and in the positively activated DMN during the DMN\u00a0+\u00a0CAPs, than the ASD group. During the DMN\u2010CAPs, auditory activation reached higher levels in the TD group. In addition, DAN activation was also more evenly related to other sensory (auditory, somatosensory), salience, and VAN networks. FPC overactivation was consistently asymmetric in the TD group: predominantly left\u2010sided during the DMN\u2010CAPs and right\u2010sided during the DMN\u00a0+\u00a0CAPs. \n\nComparing the group\u2010related changes in Figure   shows that the ASD participants demonstrated overactivation of visual medial areas during the DMN\u2010CAPs. Simultaneous overactivation with a visual network was detected among the DAN and/or DMN. This tendency might have been related to increased reliance on posterior brain areas in ASD when mediating visuospatial tasks (Kana et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). In a recent magnetoencephalography study, the ASD group presented early enhanced activity in the occipital region, suggesting that impaired face processing in ASD might be sustained by atypical responses in primary visual areas (Kovarski et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Anecdotal experiences of individuals with ASD report overwhelming sensations of visual details in everyday environments that they cannot pass without becoming absorbed in them. Abnormal simultaneous overactivation of the visual networks with the DAN and the DMNs detected in our study could reflect such propensity. \n\nPeople with ASD experience trouble filtering torrents of information, which hijacks their concentration, and this may explain why prolonged simultaneous multisensory events cause fatigue sooner for people with ASD. On the other hand, it could be speculated that neurotypical people may not be able to concentrate with similar intensity or for equal periods under normal levels of stimuli. It would be interesting to study further whether the neurobiological potential for concentration in ASD could be reflected in task\u2010related DMN activation. Such a study could utilize the gradual\u2010onset continuous performance task (gradCPT). The gradCPT is a sustained attention ability paradigm that has been validated behaviorally and recently with neuroimaging (Fortenbaugh et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). The gradCPT results show that fluctuations in attentional stability are tracked over time in task\u2010positive (e.g., DAN and VAN) and task\u2010negative (e.g., DMN) regions and vary in specific ways before attention lapses or concerning reaction time and performance. The DMN contributions are not unambiguous but also modulated, for example, by motivation (Fortenbaugh et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). We are not aware of ASD\u2010related studies utilizing gradCPT and fMRI. \n\nIn healthy adults, a network graph study found that optimal sustained attention arose from reduced network cross talk and greater within\u2010network communication in task\u2010relevant networks such as salience, cingulo\u2010opercular, dorsal attention, and visual (Zuberer et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). In contrast, optimal attention predicted greater network cross talk and reduced within\u2010network communication in auditory and sensorimotor networks and lower within\u2010network communication in the subcortical and ventral attention networks (Zuberer et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). The relationship between network graphs and brain (de)activations needs clarification. \n\nConcentration or sustained attention and mind\u2010wandering or task\u2010unrelated thoughts are two general mind states alternating with varying frequency and duration during some task. In a study by Scheibner et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ), mindful attention was characterized by less activity in the DMN than mind\u2010wandering, independent of attention type (internal breathing or external sound). The activation difference was greater in the inner attention meditation than in the external attention meditation. While the ability to concentrate or uphold sustained attention is not equal to mindfulness, these concepts are related, and mindfulness\u2010based interventions can increase attention (Trautwein et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). These transient cognitive states may be captured better in dynamical temporal analysis than static methods. Marusak et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ) showed that trait mindfulness in youths related to dynamic but not static RS connectivity. The more mindful youths transitioned more between brain states, spent less time in a particular connectivity state, and showed a state\u2010specific reduction in connectivity between salience and central executive (i.e., frontoparietal cognitive control) networks (Marusak et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). In our study, the strongest salience and FPC mean activations were detected during DMN\u00a0+\u00a0CAPs (Figure  ). We found TD group\u2010related salience and FPC L association during the DMN\u2010CAPs, but during the DMN\u00a0+\u00a0CAPs, similar activity was seen in two ASD\u2010related CAPs only (Figures   and  ). The inferences between FC and CAP analysis are not yet clear. \n\nAs stated earlier, in the ASD group, during the DAN activated task\u2010positive CAPs (24\u201321, 13\u201311, 11\u201301, 10\u201301, 04\u201301, and 02\u201301, Appendix\u00a0 : Figures\u00a0 a\u2010i), there was a repeated association with ASD\u2010related overactivation of the visual medial network (Figure  ). Parallel top\u2010down volitional attention is influenced by the DAN, which has key nodes in the bilateral intraparietal sulcus, superior parietal lobule, and frontal eye fields (Vossel et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Yamasaki et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Research has demonstrated that these dorsal frontoparietal areas can causally modulate visual areas' activity (Vossel et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). One hypothetical explanation for our study results could be that this modulating effect may be more substantial among ASD individuals. However, we detected visual overactivation during many DMN\u2010CAPs, and the CAP method used here cannot infer causality. Yamasaki et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ) reviewed studies using visual evoked potentials, event\u2010related potentials, and the diffusion tensor MRI of visual and attention networks in ASD. They found that (1) enhanced and impaired processing coexists within the lower visual area (V1), (2) local information integration from lower visual areas (V1) is impaired in higher\u2010level visual areas after V4 and V5/MT, and (3) the DAN is impaired, while the VAN is intact in ASD. The VAN contains key nodes in the temporoparietal junction and ventral frontal cortices related to automatically produced and quicker bottom\u2010up attention (Yamasaki et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Despite the results of Yamasaki et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ), some fMRI studies have found ASD\u2010related abnormalities in the VAN as well (Bernas et al.,  ; Farrant & Uddin,\u00a0 ; Fitzgerald et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nMoreover, a study by Feczko et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ) hints that some ASD subgroups have altered visual processing or attention mechanisms or both. In addition to overwhelming sensory experiences, altered connectivity of visual and attention networks may contribute to the impaired social communication in ASD. Early disordered FC involving the visual network may engender later disruptions in higher order behaviors. McKinnon et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ) showed that aberrant functional connectivities between the visual, control, DMN, DAN, and subcortical networks are also associated with certain restricted and repetitive behaviors among children with ASD at 12 and 24\u00a0months of age. Other recent findings regarding abnormal attention mechanisms in ASD have been made in studies by Bi et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ), Fitzgerald et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ), and Gabrielsen et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ). While ASD may offer advantages in various visual\u2010attentional tasks, the predisposition to intense attentional focus may come at the cost of resistance to task disengagement and other behavioral symptoms such as overfocusing and restricted interests (Kaldy et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nIn the TD group, highlighted simultaneous DAN and visual network overactivation were detected only during task\u2010positive CAP 06\u201303 and DMN\u2010positive CAP 03\u201303. The former, unlike the CAPs mentioned in the previous paragraph, exhibits mainly motor and somatosensory activation. In addition to the DAN and visual medial networks, TD group\u2010related overactivation is more comprehensive and detected among the auditory, salience and VAN, and FPC networks. \n\nA recent study showed that tactile and auditory hypersensitivity among children raised the risk of ASD diagnosis 34\u2010 and 22\u2010fold, respectively (Jussila et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Our results suggest higher auditory network baseline activity during deactivations in ASD and that somatosensory activations are less unambiguous. Despite hearing protection, noisy MRI environments may cause more auditory than somatosensory input in a supine patient lying still. \n\nAutism spectrum disorder\u2010related functional brain asymmetry has been detected during RS by, for example, Cardinale et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ) and Subbaraju et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ), who have shown rightward asymmetry shifts of functional networks and atypical hemispherical lateralization, respectively. Diffusion imaging has found inversion or diminishing of typical left\u2010right asymmetry among ASD individuals (Carper et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Conti et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Wei et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). In a similar vein, our study demonstrated ASD group\u2010related FPC activation shifts that were rightward during the DMN\u2010CAPs and leftward during the DMN\u00a0+\u00a0CAPs (Figure  ). \n\nEarlier evidence of reduced functional integration of the DMN, especially weaker coherence of connectivity between the posterior and anterior subsystems (Joshi et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Starck et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), may be mirrored in our study as higher baseline activity during the DMN\u2010CAPs, especially in the dorsal and ventral components of DMN. Still, the inferences between FC and CAP analysis remain unclear. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nResting state studies have found it difficult to show unambiguous brain FC changes in ASD (Hull et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Even though local (e.g., regional homogeneity) and more distant changes of FC have been shown (Hull et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Jao Keehn et al.,  ; Nair et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), legitimate concern has arisen that motion during RS examinations might at least partly explain the detected hypo\u2010 and/or hyperconnectivity (Jo et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Power et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Recent evidence suggests that censoring and ICA\u2010AROMA perform well across most preprocessing quality benchmarks (Parkes et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Whereas earlier dual\u2010regression ICA and FC analysis has revealed only hypoconnectivity within the DMN subnetworks of our study participants with ASD (Starck et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), we found significant differences in many CAPs. When similarly activated brain BOLD fMRI volumes are accumulated into CAPs, between\u2010group comparisons may become more powerful than, for example, sliding window methods, in which each \"window\" of sequential volumes includes more heterogeneous brain activation patterns. When discussing results, one should remember that hierarchical clusters are nested and thus volumes accumulate as we move up the hierarchy into lower\u2010numbered cluster levels. Depending on the different spatial (de)activation signal amplitudes of the clusters (CAPs) combined and the difference in the brain areas' activation behavior between the groups, some of the spatial between\u2010group differences may fade, and others may increase from one hierarchical level to another. \n\nIt should be remembered that hierarchical clustering is an exploratory method and imposes a hierarchical structure regardless of whether such exists in the data (Friedman et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Accordingly, the results should be interpreted cautiously. However, based on both previous research knowledge about alternating rest and task states of brain function and our results, this method can yield meaningful complementary information on the \"natural\" occurrence of CAPs and their relations to each other during RS\u2010fMRI. The coarse division in our data showed that 61% of the volumes had default mode\u2010positive RSN features. RS data certainly also include varying epochs with true task\u2010positive ICN activations, as the MRI environment is noisy and disruptive, especially to young individuals, and we imaged RS with the participants' eyes open. Empirical evidence suggests that eyes\u2010open brain states are better controlled than eyes\u2010closed states, but that eye status affects local connectivity, highlighting overconnectivity in posterior, visual regions and underconnectivity in the cingulate gyrus (Nair et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). We did not compare RS with task data, and the relationship between the CAPs of the rest and task data should be addressed in the future to determine the proportions of DMN\u2010positive and task\u2010positive activity in combined data and the various settings: or to determine whether certain CAPs and their between\u2010group differences persist during tasks and how they are modified. In this context, there is suggestive evidence that functional hierarchies in the pediatric brain are stable and similar during rest and task (Harrewijn et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nAs stated earlier, due to   z  \u2010score averaging, the nuances of CAPs are lost in the heatmap, and a few seemingly similar CAPs coexist on both DMN\u2010negative and DMN\u2010positive sides of the clustering results. The clustering procedure itself is, of course, unaware of this interpretive naming convention and simplification aimed to facilitate the understanding of complex network interactions. In addition to averaging, the weaknesses of the chosen method may predispose to this phenomenon. \n\nThere are several linkage methods in hierarchical clustering. We chose Ward's method as it shares a common principle with k\u2010means, providing a basis for current research and comparison to earlier research. We found a high correlation with the CAPs from Liu et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ) using the fslcc tool (results not shown), though their results were acquired after global mean removal. Using GSR could eliminate artifacts even more efficiently than censoring and ICA\u2010AROMA alone (Byrge & Kennedy,\u00a0 ; Ciric et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Murphy & Fox,\u00a0 ; Power et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Possible anticorrelations in the CAPs might not be as problematic as with FC measures, as signal amplitudes are compared. Our educated guess is that using GSR would reduce the portion of CAPs that exhibit whole brain\u2010wide activation or deactivation. Unfortunately, censoring reduces degrees of freedom and may also remove the signal of interest from the data. For example, Syed et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ) found that although the DMN provided the highest discriminability between the control and ASD groups, the motor network regions with midcingulate cortex and temporal\u2010parietal junction were also discriminatory. Moreover, the choice of clustering distance measure (cosine, Euclidean, Pearson correlation, etc.) may potentially increase or decrease GSR\u2010like effects. \n\nBesides distance and linkage adjustments, combining other statistical procedures such as permutational methods to hierarchical clustering could achieve results closer to the ground truth. Based on our study, however, efforts to refine volume\u2010wise methods are worth pursuing. Hierarchical and k\u2010means are only two common, older clustering methods, and more efficient algorithms that can utilize fMRI\u2010specific data features probably exist. For example, random forest methods could be used in a volume\u2010wise fashion instead of measures from temporally stationary FC (Feczko et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Fern\u00e1ndez\u2010Delgado et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Though FC and ICA RS metrics are not substantially affected by different TRs, faster imaging methods such as MREG with 10\u201320\u00a0Hz temporal resolution show \"neural avalanches,\" which in traditional 0.5\u20131\u00a0Hz fMRI temporal resolutions are only seen as aliased images and could enable the study of higher cluster numbers and shorter CAPs (Huotari et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Rajna et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), though the inherently slow hemodynamic response function may act as a limiting bottleneck (Bolton et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Faster imaging and dynamic lag analysis (Kotila et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Raatikainen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) or causality analysis methods (Bernas et al.,  ; Bielczyk et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Borchers et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Chen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Deshpande & Hu,\u00a0 ; Kaminski et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Li et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) may shed light on interactions between attention, visual, and other brain networks. MREG fMRI coupled with simultaneous EEG analysis (Hiltunen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Li et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Ridley et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) could clarify the relationship between the neural avalanches and the brain's electrical activity in the future. \n\nAs each volume is a time point in the imaging time series and is assigned with cluster membership, this method could map the changes at the individual level. The current study could be extended using a network or Markov chain analysis to determine whether there are repetitive sequences or states in the occurrence of the CAPs (Chen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Liu et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Zhuang et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), as some ASD studies indicate (Malaia et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Zhang et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nEven if independent RSNs seemed to activate normally, CAP analysis might reveal aberrant in\u2010between network interactions and their timing. FC analysis could be supplemented by CAP analysis. It may find CAPs that exhibit the greatest differences between the voxels with aberrant connectivity and may pinpoint the moments at which the differences lie and detect simultaneous patterns in other intrinsic networks and their activity levels. This knowledge may help find new approaches to ASD rehabilitation: for example, using customized stimuli targeting brain network combinations that have been found to have abnormal interactions or appropriate timing in interaction situations. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nThe present study describes one relatively simple method for comparing CAPs between study populations, but because a myriad of network combinations are possible and the signal amplitude in each network varies greatly, developing a method that could satisfyingly capture the whole dynamics of brain networks is still a never\u2010ending challenge. Based on our study experiences, we encourage the development of volume\u2010wise approaches as an option to further characterize the TVFC changes in brain networks. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n\n### PEER REVIEW \n  \nThe peer review history for this article is available at  . \n\n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8213933, "text_md5": "66eaa7e07ed618f436273034079a84ed", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 237], "journal": [238, 249], "publication_year": [251, 255], "title": [266, 376], "keywords": [390, 487], "abstract": [500, 3158], "body": [3167, 49918]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 33998178, "doi": "10.1002/brb3.2174", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213933", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8213933"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213933\">8213933</a>", "list_title": "PMC8213933  Co\u2010activation pattern alterations in autism spectrum disorder\u2013A volume\u2010wise hierarchical clustering fMRI study"}
