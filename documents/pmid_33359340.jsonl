It is worth noting that explicit and implicit fear processing produces different behavioral and neurophysiological outcomes. The present study capitalizes on the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method of meta-analysis to identify: (a) the \"core\" network of fear processing in healthy individuals; (b) common and specific neural activations associated with explicit and implicit processing of fear. Following PRISMA guidelines, a total of 92 fMRI and PET studies were included in the meta-analysis. The overall analysis show that the core fear network comprises the amygdala, pulvinar, and fronto-occipital regions. Both implicit and explicit fear processing activated amygdala, declive, fusiform gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus, suggesting that these two types of fear processing share a common neural substrate. Explicit fear processing elicited more activations at the pulvinar and parahippocampal gyrus, suggesting visual attention/orientation and contextual association play important roles during explicit fear processing. In contrast, implicit fear processing elicited more activations at the cerebellum-amygdala-cortical pathway, indicating an 'alarm' system underlying implicit fear processing. These findings have shed light on the neural mechanism underlying fear processing at different levels of awareness.
