Although there are some reviews of previous neuroimaging studies on appetitive behaviors, the findings on neural activation in response to pictures of high- and low-calorie foods seem inconsistent. This study aims to systematically review, integrate, and meta-analyze neuroimaging evidence of viewing high- and low-calorie foods. There were 25 samples from 24 studies, totalizing 489 normal-weight participants (311 female, 160 male, and 18 of unknown sex). We conducted a systematic review and Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on viewing high-calorie foods (versus non-foods), low-calorie foods (versus non-foods), and high- versus low-calorie foods. In systematic review, several brain regions were shown to be activated when viewing high- or low-calorie foods (versus non-foods) and viewing high- versus low-calorie foods, including the prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, insula, ventral striatum, hippocampus, superior parietal lobe, and fusiform gyrus. However, the ALE meta-analysis showed that the left orbitofrontal cortex, left amygdala, insula, superior parietal lobe, and fusiform gyrus were activated when viewing high-calorie foods (versus non-foods); the left fusiform gyrus was activated when viewing low-calorie foods (versus non-foods); and no cluster was activated when viewing high- versus low-calorie foods. Our research suggests an appetitive brain network that includes visual perception and attentional processing, sensory input integration, subjective reward value encoding, decision-making, and top-down cognitive control. Future studies should control for the effects of methodological and physiological variables when examining the neural correlates of viewing high- and low-calorie foods.
