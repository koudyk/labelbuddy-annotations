All the patients underwent   TSC1   and   TSC2   genetic testing as well as renal phenotypic evaluation. All analyses were performed using the SPSS software, version 19.0, with a cut-off   P   value of 0.05 considered statistically significant. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe identified variants in 93% (161/173) cases, including 16%   TSC1   and 77%   TSC2   variants. Analysis of the relationship between the genotype and renal phenotype, revealed that those with   TSC2   variants were more likely to develop severe renal AML (>\u20094) (  P  \u2009=\u20090.044). In terms of treatment,   TSC2   variants were more likely to undergo nephrectomy/partial nephrectomy (  P  \u2009=\u20090.036) and receive mTOR medication such as everolimus (  P  \u2009<\u20090.001). However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of their response to the everolimus treatment. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nPatients with   TSC2   variants exhibit more severe renal phenotypes, especially those associated with renal angiomyolipomas (AML), and they often require nephrectomy/partial nephrectomy or mTOR medication. Detection of the genotype is helpful in TSC management. \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13023-022-02443-1. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAs an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is characterized by hamartomas in multiple organ systems, with an incidence rate of\u2009~\u20091/6000 to 1/10,000 [ ]. TSC is believed to develop from a pathogenic variant of   TSC1   or, more commonly,   TSC2  . Coding proteins of   TSC1   and   TSC2   can form a functional complex repressing upstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Either   TSC1   or   TSC2   variants can inactivate the TSC1/TSC2 complex, which results in the hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway and promotes cell growth and proliferation, leading to the development of benign tumors or hamartomas in multiple organ systems, including the skin, brain, eyes, heart, and kidneys. Therefore, therapies targeting mTOR have contributed to encouraging results in the treatment of TSC [ ]. \n\nThe   TSC1   gene has 23 exons extending over approximately 55\u00a0kb of the genomic DNA on chromosome 9q34.3. The TSC1 mRNA is transcribed from exons 3 to 23, and its subsequent protein hamartin is translated from the 8.6\u00a0kb mRNA transcript and has an estimated molecular weight of 130\u00a0kDa. On the other hand, the   TSC2   gene has 42 exons extending over approximately 40\u00a0kb of the genomic DNA on chromosome 16p13.3. Its subsequent protein tuberin is translated from the 5.5\u00a0kb mRNA transcript and has an estimated molecular weight of 200\u00a0kDa [ ,  ]. The encoded proteins can form a heterotrimeric complex, termed the TSC protein complex, with TBC1 domain family member 7 (TBC1D7). Importantly,   TSC2   contains a highly conserved GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain that enables the TSC protein complex to inhibit mTOR pathway by RAS homologue enriched in brain (Rheb) [ ]. \n\nThe renal phenotypes of TSC include renal AML, cysts, impaired kidney function and, rarely, renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Specifically, AML, a type of benign tumor, develops in the kidneys in up to 80% of TSC patients [ ]. It contributes to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and intrarenal hemorrhage, thus acting as the most common cause of TSC-related mortality. Furthermore, cysts develop in approximately 30\u201345% of TSC patients and may be associated with acute or chronic kidney failure and resistant hypertension. RCC, affecting 2\u20133% of TSC patients, may be misdiagnosed as fat-poor AML [ ]. These complications substantially worsen the patient survival rate and underscore the necessity for early diagnosis and prompt treatment of TSC. Thus, there is a crucial need for more optimized diagnostic protocols to assist medical practitioners in the early diagnosis of TSC and the evaluation of multiple organs to improve patient outcomes. \n\nThe correlation between TSC and neurological abnormalities has been widely documented [ ,  ], but many TSC patients often seek urological treatment primarily because of the diagnosis of renal AML. In this study, we focused on the correlation between TSC genotypes and renal phenotypes that were not well discussed in large cohort studies performed previously. Intending to guide clinical therapy with precision for TSC patients, we further explored whether different genotypes affect mTOR inhibitor treatment response.\n \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study group \n  \nA cohort of all 173 unrelated patients with a definite diagnosis of TSC who had been treated at Xiangya Hospital Central South University, Peking Union Medical College Hospital and The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from September 2014 to September 2020 was included in this study. The study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and local regulations, and obtained ethical approval. Definite diagnosis was defined as fulfilling 2 major criteria or 1 major criterion and\u2009\u2265\u20092 minor criteria recommended by the 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference [ ]. All patients underwent renal, pulmonary, and brain imaging evaluations as well as renal function tests, and some also underwent pulmonary function tests (n\u2009=\u2009157), cardiotocography (n\u2009=\u2009155), and pathological diagnosis (n\u2009=\u200944). Patients with at least one AML (diameter\u2009\u2265\u200930\u00a0mm) were treated with oral everolimus 10\u00a0mg per day for at least 3\u00a0months. Then they received follow-up radiographic evaluation at 3 and 6\u00a0months. The primary efficacy endpoint was achieving a\u2009\u2265\u200925% reduction in the total volume of target AML compared to baseline in patients with confirmed AML response.\n \n\n\n### Renal phenotypic assessment \n  \nPatients were further categorized based on the renal angiomyolipoma staging criteria described previously [ ]. The AML volumes were calculated based on the results of kidney computed tomography (CT) (n\u2009=\u200992) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n\u2009=\u200981). Moreover, the CKD stage (1\u20135) was determined by determining the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that was calculated based on serum creatinine levels using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) formula. Specifically, patients without renal angiomyolipoma were categorized as stage 0. On the other hand, if the AML stage could not be determined until the end of follow-up, these patients were also categorized as stage 0. Patients receiving hemodialysis were categorized as CKD stage 5 regardless of GFR values. \n\n\n### Mutational analysis \n  \nPeripheral blood (10\u00a0mL) samples were collected from each patient for   TSC1  /  TSC2   gene detection. The mutational analysis was performed by the next-generation sequencing (NGS) at the Beijing Genomics Institute (Shenzhen, P.R. China) or the NHC Key Laboratory of Cancer Proteomics (Hunan Province, P.R. China). And all variants were verified by PCR-SSCP. Finally, they were compared with the LOVD databases ( ;  ) and classified into five categories according to the ACMG guideline [ ]: class 5 (pathogenic), class 4 (likely pathogenic), class 3 (variant of unknown significance), class 2 (likely benign), and class 1 (benign).The possible effect of the newly identified mutations due to amino acid substitutions on protein function was determined using the online tools SIFT and PolyPhen2. Patients with predicted disease-associated mutations in the   TSC1   and   TSC2   genes were labeled accordingly. Patients with no definite findings or only intron mutations that unlikely to be pathogenic were labeled as \u201cno mutation identified\u201d (NMI) (Additional file  ). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nContinuous variables were reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (M\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) and categorical variables were reported as frequency counts and percentages (%). All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software, version 19.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables were compared by Mann\u2013Whitney U test, while categorical variables were compared by Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. All the reported   P   values were 2-sided. A   P   value of\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant, which was bold in the tables. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### The mutation rate of TSC1/TSC2 is 85% \n  \nIn general, the mutation rate of   TSC1  /  TSC2   was 93% among the 173 patients. Specifically, we identified 27 (16%) variants in   TSC1  , 134 (77%) in   TSC2   and 12 (7%) NMI (Fig.\u00a0 A). Moreover, the types of   TSC1   and   TSC2   variants are summarized in Fig.\u00a0 B\u2013C.   TSC1   variants mainly included 65% nonsense and 19% frameshift events, whereas the   TSC2   variants mainly included 33% nonsense, 27% missense and 24% frameshift events. The distributions of different variants within the   TSC1   and   TSC2   genes are shown in Fig.\u00a0 D\u2013E. Furthermore, the most common mutation site in the   TSC1   gene was located in exon 15 (7/27; 26% of total   TSC1   variants), whereas that in the   TSC2   gene was located in exon 30 (15/134; 11% of total   TSC2   variants). Exons 35\u201339 of the   TSC2   gene are responsible for encoding the GTPase activating-protein (GAP) domain, which is essential for tuberin function. We identified 18 variants within these five exons that accounted for almost 13% of all the   TSC2   variants identified. They included all four mutation types (nonsense mutations, missense mutations, frameshift mutations, and large rearrangements). Next, we performed NGS on these patients, as well as analyzed the data using the LOVD database ( ,  ) and related studies. The majority of the variants had been reported previously, most of which were pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, and only 5 variants (1   TSC1   and 4   TSC2  ) were benign or likely benign. In addition, 14 novel variants were found of uncertain significance, including 3   TSC1   variants and 11   TSC2   variants (Table  ). These NMI, intron mutations, variants of uncertain significance, and benign/likely benign variants were excluded from the subsequent analysis. We mainly focused on the correlation between pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants with the renal phenotypes.   \n TSC1   and   TSC2   gene mutation spectrum in Chinese patients.

The age of the patients with   TSC1   variants was not significantly different from that of the patients with   TSC2   variants (  P  \u2009=\u20090.37). Female TSC patients were more likely to carry   TSC1   variants rather than   TSC2   variants, as 17 (17/21, 81%)   TSC1   variants were identified in female patients, whereas only 59 (59/107, 55%)   TSC2   variants were identified in female patients (  P  \u2009=\u20090.031). Moreover, 15 (15/21, 71%)   TSC1   variants and 97 (97/107, 91%)   TSC2   variants were detected as de novo variants, whereas familial inheritance was observed in the remaining variants. Overall, the proportion of de novo variants was significantly higher in   TSC2   variants than in   TSC1   variants (  P  \u2009=\u20090.015). Regarding the symptoms considered for determining the major or minor criteria of TSC, there was no significant difference in the incidence of different phenotypes among different genotype subgroups.   \nClinical characteristics by genotype in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex \n  \n SEN   subependymal nodules,   SEGA   subependymal giant cell astrocytoma,   LAM   lymphagioleiomatosis,   AML   angiomyolipomas \n  \n\n\n### Patients with TSC2 variants are more likely to develop more severe renal complications \n  \nTo determine the correlation between renal phenotypes and genotypes, we compared the renal phenotypes of   TSC1   variants to those of   TSC2   variants (Table  ).we found that patients with   TSC2   variants were more likely to develop more severe versions of renal AML (>\u20094) (  P  \u2009=\u20090.044). Significant differences with regard to the treatment received for renal AML were observed between those groups.   TSC2   variants were more likely to receive nephrectomy/partial nephrectomy (  P  \u2009=\u20090.036). And they preferred to receive mTOR medication such as everolimus (  P  \u2009<\u20090.001). For these patients carrying with pathogenic mutations, a total of 37 patients underwent pathological diagnosis, including 27 AML (1   TSC1   and 26   TSC2  ), 6 epithelioid AML (6   TSC2  ) and 4 RCC (1   TSC1   and 3   TSC2  ). There was no significant difference of endogenous creatinine clearance rate (Ccr) and CKD stage among the different genotype subgroups. Moreover, there were 3 patients with   TSC2   variants who had polycystic kidney disease (PKD). The four patients with AML and RCC were mainly between 40 and 45\u00a0years old. All of them had neurological involvement, and multiple subependymal nodules were found on cranial MRI. Three of them received everolimus treatment but none had a good response.   \nRenal complications by genotype in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex \n  \n AML   angiomyolipomas,   Ccr   endogenous creatinine clearance rate,   CKD   chronic kidney disease,   PKD   polycystic kidney disease \n  \n\n\n### Genotype does not affect the response of AML volume to mTOR medication \n  \nWe investigated the effect of genomic factors on the reduction in AML volume after mTOR treatment (Table  ). A total of 72 patients received everolimus for 3\u00a0months, including 68 patients with   TSC2   variants and 4 patients with   TSC1   variants. A total of 70 patients received everolimus for 6\u00a0months, including 66 patients with   TSC2   variants and 4 patients with   TSC1   variants. Before receiving the medication, the volume of target AML in patients with   TSC2   variants was 70\u2009\u00b1\u200976 cm , whereas that in patients with   TSC1   variants or NMI was 235\u2009\u00b1\u2009538 cm . There was no significant difference in AML volume between the two groups (  P  \u2009=\u20090.54). In general, 76% of patients with   TSC2   variants and 75% of patients with   TSC1   variants responded to the medication at 3\u00a0months (  P  \u2009=\u20090.99), while 85% of patients with   TSC2   variants and 100% of patients with   TSC1   variants responded to the medication at 6\u00a0months (  P  \u2009=\u20090.99). At the 6-month follow-up, one   TSC2   variant stopped receiving everolimu due to adverse event, and another   TSC2   variant withdrew from the cohort for economic reason. There was no significant difference in age, gender and family history between two groups. Moreover, there was no statistical difference in the reduction of AML volume after the everolimus treatment and the response rate between two groups.   \nResponse of angiomyolipoma volume to everolimus by genotype \n  \n AML   angiomyolipomas \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we identified 161 variants in 173 unrelated patients (93%), including 27 (16%) with   TSC1   variants and 134 (77%) with   TSC2   variants, which is higher than that reported in other countries [ \u2013 ]. This is due to the NGS applied in this study. Several intron variants of   TSC1  /  TSC2   have been found in our study. Because they are usually not pathogenic or likely pathogenic, these variants have been excluded from subsequent phenotype related analysis. Moreover, we identified 14 novel   TSC1  /  TSC2   variants, which expands the public database and calls for researchers to investigate its functions. Mosaicism may partially explain the 12 NMI case, which has been found in approximately 1/2 NMI patients [ ]. Further locus heterogeneity in TSC also remains a theoretical possibility. In the present study, we analyzed the mutation spectrum of   TSC1  /  TSC2   genes based on a Chinese TSC cohort with large sample size. Multiple types of variants were detected, including frameshift, nonsense, missense, and large rearrangement mutations. Further stratification analysis showed that nonsense mutations were the predominated mutation type across   TSC1   variants, whereas frameshift and missense mutations were more common in   TSC2   variants, which is consistent with the results of another Chinese cohort study [ ]. Moreover, in this study, we identified that exon 15 is the most frequent mutation site in   TSC1   variants as reported previously [ ]. However, exon 30 was uniquely identified as the most frequent mutation site in   TSC2   variants in our study, which may be a hotspot mutation region in Chinese patients with TSC since previous studies have rarely reported this mutation site. Furthermore, previous studies have found   TSC2   variant sites scattered throughout the gene but more common in exons 35\u201339 [ ]. They encode the GAP domain, which affects mTOR inhibition by the TSC protein complex. Therefore, variants within this region play an important role in the pathogenesis of TSC and correlate with poor clinical outcomes [ ]. We also observed several   TSC2   variants within this region in our study. By performing genomic analysis of TSC patients, the mutation spectrum and distribution profiles of the two essential genes (  TSC1   and   TSC2  ) in the Chinese TSC population have gradually become comprehensive and clear. Intriguingly, 14 novel variants of   TSC1  /  TSC2   genes were confirmed in our study, which can be used as a reliable reference for future genetic testing of TSC patients. \n\nWe further identified a significant correlation between the clinical characteristics and genotypes of patients with TSC. There was no significant difference in age distribution among the two groups in the study. However, it has been suggested that the onset age of renal AML among   TSC2   variants was earlier, which requires further exploration [ ]. The role of gender in TSC-associated pathogenesis has been studied previously in both animal models and human studies but the findings remain controversial. A previous study found that males with TSC have a greater risk of learning disorders and autism than females with TSC [ ]. However, a large sample cohort study in the United States suggested that   TSC1  /  TSC2   variants showed no significant distributive difference between male and female patients [ ]. In our cohort, a contrary conclusion was drawn that males with TSC were more likely to carry   TSC2   variants. Further research by including independent cohorts with larger sample sizes is needed to verify whether sex hormones are involved in the   TSC1  /  TSC2   mutations and TSC pathogenesis. Additionally, we found that 29%   TSC1   variants were familial variants, whereas only 9%   TSC2   variants were inherited from families, which is consistent with the results of the previous studies [ ,  ,  ]. We confirmed the higher frequency of familial   TSC1   variants compared to that of familial   TSC2   variants, which is attributed to the smaller size and simpler structure of the   TSC1   genomic locus, and the rarity of missense mutations, frames shift mutations and large rearrangements at the locus [ ]. A large number of   TSC1   variants was observed in familial cases probably because patients with   TSC1   variants are less likely to be affected by severe neurocognitive impairment and are therefore more likely to have offspring [ ,  ]. \n\nSome researchers have attempted to determine genotype/phenotype correlations with TSC but could not conclusively establish a relationship between these factors [ ,  ]. A robust correlation has been previously established between   TSC2   variants and poor clinical phenotypes including skin, neurological, and renal features [ ,  ]. A previous study failed to found positive results between renal AML and genotypes in Chinese population [ ]. While another Chinese cohort study found that the renal AML volume of   TSC2   variants was significantly larger than that of   TSC1   variants [ ]. More recently, the correlation between mutational sites and renal AML have been evaluated [ ]. It identified some mutational sites, such as   TSC2   mutations in the transcription activation domain 1 coding genes, had higher risk of renal AML. However, only the number of patients with or without renal AML were demonstrated. The specific details about renal AML were not analyzed. Compared with these study, our strength is that this is a multi-center study with relatively large sample size. More importantly, we also focused on treatment options as well as other TSC-associated kidney diseases, such as renal cysts, PKD, etc. in addition to comparisons of renal AML. Specifically, we found that patients with   TSC2   variants were more likely to develop more advanced AML (AML stage\u2009>\u20094). Besides, these   TSC2   variants often received nephrectomy/partial nephrectomy or mTOR medication such as everolimus. This reflects that   TSC2   variants may be associated with more severe renal phenotypes. And the history of nephrectomy/partial nephrectomy may contribute to some of the negative findings. Previous studies have reported that   TSC2   variants were more likely to develop more severe CKD [ ,  ]. Although there were no difference between the two groups in our study, we can see that there was a trend. Overall,   TSC2   variants are more likely to have more severe renal phenotype. Thus, in the clinical setting, patients with   TSC2   variants should receive a more comprehensive renal evaluation and be treated promptly if renal abnormalities are detected. There were 4 patients (4/173, 2%) accompanied with RCC, which is consistent with the incidence reported in previous article [ ]. It has been defined as RCC with fibrous stroma (RCC-FMS) (formerly RCC with leiomyomatous or smooth muscle stroma) by the The Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) [ ]. Among these 4 patients, 3 were treated with everolimus but did not achieved satisfactory outcomes. Therefore, it remains to be explored whether mTOR inhibitors play a role in TSC accompanied with RCC. There were 3 patients with   TSC2   muations suffered PKD in this study, with the mutation type of large rearrangements. Because   TSC2   gene is adjacent to   PKD1   gene, large deletion involving these two genes may lead to   PKD1/TSC2   continuous gene deletion syndrome (CGS). Because we mainly focused on the mutations of   TSC1   and   TSC2  ,   PKD1   mutations were not detected. The latest research suggested CGS screening for patients with PKD and TSC-associated renal neoplasia as well as TSC patients with cystic renal disease [ ]. This is worthy of further study in the follow-up. \n\nGiven that TSC results from the dysregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway, the advent of mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus, an analog of rapamycin, has provided great therapeutic promise in treating TSC [ ]. It has been reported that the most significant reduction in renal AML growth by everolimus usually occurred within the initial 3\u20136\u00a0months of treatment, whereafter the tumor volume stabilized or gradually decreased. Therefore, we mainly followed up their renal AMLs at 3 and 6\u00a0months after everolimus treatment. We previously confirmed that everolimus was well tolerated and showed promising efficacy in Chinese patients with TSC-RAML [ ]. In this study, the overall response rate to everolimus treatment was approximately 86% at 6\u00a0months, which was even higher than the previous report [ ]. This further confirmed the effectiveness of everolimus in the treatment of renal angiomyolipoma. For these non-responders, most of them suffered renal AML with large volume, which is consistent with our previous study [ ]. Further we compared the response of patients with different genotypes to the everolimus treatment. There was no statistical difference in the reduction of AML volume and the response rate between the two groups after receiving the medication. Therefore, studies using larger patient populations should be performed to determine whether the efficacy of everolimus is related to the genotype. \n\nThere were some limitations in this study. First, our study lacks precise and concrete data type since we defined the renal phenotype as the primary outcome, which is a qualitative data type rather than a quantitative one. The relationship between more quantitative renal phenotype and genotype needs to be assessed to help clinicians in comprehensively evaluating TSC patients and further guide precision medicine at the clinical stage. Second, the sample size of our cohort was not large enough, especially the number of patients treated with everolimus. Thus, our results is insufficiently powered to compare the impact of   TSC1   versus   TSC2   genotype on the response of AML volume to mTOR medication. Future studies should include more independent cohorts with larger patient populations to investigate the underlying relationships between genotypes and renal phenotypes as well as treatment response in TSC patients. Moreover, because of technical limitations, we were unable to measure the blood concentration. So we controlled the dose to reduce the bias. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, the overall positive   TSC1  /  TSC2   mutation detection rate in patients with TSC was 85% in our study. Those with   TSC2   variants were associated with more severe renal phenotypes compared with those with   TSC1   variants. Detection of the genotype is helpful in TSC management, which can be helpful for determining risk profiles, and in turn guide medical practitioners to treat TSC patients in a more precise manner with the hope to prevent complications and improve therapeutic outcomes. \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9308181, "text_md5": "10de3fec18447de5067d87165b34b60c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 166], "journal": [167, 186], "publication_year": [188, 192], "title": [203, 310], "keywords": [324, 386], "abstract": [399, 1989], "body": [1998, 26538]}, "part": 1, "chapter": 2, "page": 20, "pmid": 35870981, "doi": "10.1186/s13023-022-02443-1"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9308181>9308181</a> \u2014 Part 1 Chapter 2 Page 20", "list_title": "1.2.20 Renal phenotypes correlate with genotypes in unrelated individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex in China"}
