Here, Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis, following the current best-practice guidelines, was conducted. We searched multiple databases and traced the references up to June 2018. Then, we extracted the reported coordinates reflecting group comparison between ADHD and healthy subjects from 96 eligible studies, containing 1914 unique participants. The analysis of pooled structural and functional, sub-analyses restricted to modality, and in-/decreased contrast did not yield any significant findings. However, further sub-analyses in the task-fMRI experiments (neutral stimuli only) led to aberrant activity in the left pallidum/putamen and decreased activity (male subjects only) in the left inferior frontal gyrus. The overall findings indicate a lack of regional convergence in children/adolescents with ADHD, which might be due to heterogeneous clinical populations, various experimental design, preprocessing, statistical procedures in individual publications. Our results highlight the need for further high-powered investigations, but may also indicate ADHD pathophysiology might rest in network interactions rather than just regional abnormality.
