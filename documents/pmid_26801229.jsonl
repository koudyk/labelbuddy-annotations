Over the last fifteen years, activity patterns underlying a variety of perceptual features and objects have been decoded from the brains of participants in fMRI scans. Through a novel multi-study meta-analysis, we have analyzed and modeled relations between decoding strength in the visual ventral stream, and stimulus and methodological variables that differ across studies. We report findings that suggest: (i) several organizational principles of the ventral stream, including a gradient of pattern granulation and an increasing abstraction of neural representations as one proceeds anteriorly; (ii) how methodological choices affect decoding strength. The data also show that studies with stronger decoding performance tend to be reported in higher-impact journals, by authors with a higher h-index. As well as revealing principles of regional processing, our results and approach can help investigators select from the thousands of design and analysis options in an empirical manner, to optimize future studies of fMRI decoding.
