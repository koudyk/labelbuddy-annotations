Though controversial, Brinley plots can assess between-task differences, the impact of increasing task demand, and the relationship between responses in two groups of subjects. Since a relationship exists between response times and the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal of functional MRI (fMRI), Brinley's plotting method could be applied as a meta-analysis tool in fMRI studies of aging. Here, fledgling \u201cPeiffer plots\u201d are discussed for their potential impact on understanding general cognitive brain activity in aging. Preliminary results suggest that general cognitive slowing may be localized at the sensorimotor transformation in the precentral gyrus. Although this meta-analysis method is naturally used with imaging studies of aging, theoretically it may be applied to other study pairs (e.g., schizophrenic versus normal) or imaging datasets (e.g., PET). \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. INTRODUCTION \n  \nIn the mid 1960s, Brinley \npresented a novel plotting \nmethod to consider the\nrelationship between response times in young and older \nadults across a variety\nof tasks with varying levels of cognitive difficulty \n[ ]. The average response times\nfor both the young and older groups of adults on each task was \nplaced on a\nscatter-plot, and a regression line was then fitted to the \ndata using the\noperation of  . \nIn doing so, a relationship was \nrealized between the\nbehavior in young adults and its ability to predict behavior \non the same task\nin older adults. The power of this method of data analysis is \nthat it can be\nused across task types to pool data from multiple studies. \nHere we harvest the\npowerful aspects of the Brinley analysis method and apply \nthem to functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Meta-analyses of \nfMRI data are\ntypically hindered by differences in the types of tasks \nused across studies.\nThe use of the Brinley method allows for a \nmeta-analysis of fMRI data that\nactually takes advantage of multiple cognitive tasks. \nHowever, the remaining\nchallenge is to carefully interpret the findings. \n\nThe history of Brinley plots is rife with \ndebate and discussion on what the plot is measuring\nand what it means. Feelings in opposing camps can \neven be so strong as to\nelicit T-shirts emblazoned with the No symbol over \nthe word Brinley. Later\nresearchers inferred that aspects of Brinley plots \ncould provide information on\ngeneral cognitive functioning in older adults since \nBrinley's data contained\nboth task switching and nonswitching data subsets \n[ \u2013 ]. For example, if the slope\nfor the fitted line of a group of tasks is 1, then there is \nequal change between tasks for younger and older adults. \nHowever, when the slope of the\nfitted line deviates and is greater than 1, there is \nan increased slowing in\nolder adults associated with more cognitively demanding tasks \n(i.e., a general cognitive slowing deficit is evident in \nolder adults regardless of task [e.g., \n[ ]]). Other researchers have\ndisagreed with this Brinley plot interpretation and suggest \nthat the plot\nreflects a difference in response variability \nbetween the age groups rather\nthan processing speed, per se \n[ ]. \nFinally, current work in how\naging affects processing speed questions the degree \nto which general cognitive\nslowing can be summarized with one linear \nfunction across all types of tasks \n[ ,  ,  ]. \n\nIn addition to describing the behavioral appearance \nof cognitive slowing, research\nhas pursued localizing the phenomenon within the \naging brain. Generalized\ncognitive slowing has been thought to \nresult from pervasive slowing of all\ncognitive brain functions in older adults. \nWith this in mind, some researchers\nhave proposed that the locus of general \ncognitive slowing occurs where sensory\nimpulses transfer to a common site of motor \ngeneration for the response and\nthat this sensorimotor dysregulation intensifies \nwith more difficult tasks [ \u2013 ]. Yordanova and colleagues\nfound evidence to support this hypothesis using event-related \npotentials, which\nare able to evaluate the timing and strength \nof cognitive processing in\nresponse to external stimuli \n[ ]. However, when considering\ntask-specific slowing impact, other researchers point to \nadditional slowing in\nspecific cognitive areas such as working memory, \nvisual search and mental\nrotation [ , \n ], \nwhich may occur in addition to\nor instead of the sensorimotor slowing. \n\nAfter reviewing the body of research literature \non general cognitive slowing in\naging, we adopted the early Brinley method \nfor plotting reaction times and\napplied it to the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) \nsignal from multiple fMRI\nstudies. In doing so, an attempt is made to localize \nbrain areas responsible\nfor the deviant slope in the response time Brinley plot. \nUnlike reaction times,\nthe BOLD signal has a \nlegitimate negative value\n(i.e., deactivations) that occurs when contrasting activity \nduring two different events. For example, \ncertain brain areas are more active during\nbaseline than during any particular task. \nThese areas prominently include\nposterior cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobe \nareas and are known as\nthe default network [ ]. \nIn applying Brinley's\nplotting method on the BOLD signal, we are able to construct \nnovel Peiffer\nplots, a meta-analysis of fMRI data that is not limited to \nsite locations of\nactivation maxima and thus not skewed to evaluate only areas \nidentified as\nstatistically different within a study \n[see discussion in [ ]]. \nTypical meta-analyses of\nfMRI data use location-centered approaches \nwhere the focus of peak activity is\nevaluated [ \u2013 ]. This can underestimate\nbetween-task differences because subthreshold \nactivity differences are\noverlooked [see discussion in [ ]]. \nFurther, differences in task\nparameters and paradigm domain limit the tasks \ncompared in many fMRI\nmeta-analyses to a single type of task \n(e.g., Stroop interference task \n[ , \n ]). \nWith the novel method\nproposed here, a plot can be made across a \nvariety of fMRI studies to evaluate\ntwo different population groups to identify areas \nshowing between-task\ndifferences that may not necessarily be identified as \ndeviant within an\nindividual study comparison. Lastly, in using this method to \ncompare young and\nolder adults, we may be able to show localization of the areas \nthat may in fact\nidentify differences in age-related information \nprocessing that characterize\ngeneral cognitive slowing. \n\n\n## 2. METHODS \n  \nBOLD data and behavioral response times were obtained from 4 simple \ndetection tasks (3 visual and 1 auditory). In order to plot a BOLD signal value \nfor young and older adults in each study, original fMRI data was needed. \nThe fMRI Data Center ( ) contributed a complete dataset from Buckner and colleagues \n(Accession no. 2-2000-1118W) for 2 points in\nthe analysis (young = 14; older adults = 14) \n[ ]. These BOLD signal\nmeasurements related to responses associated with the \npresentation of a single\nor double flashing checkerboard. The other 2 points were \nfrom studies performed\nin our laboratory (young = 20; older adults = 20) \n[ ]. These BOLD signal\nmeasurements were related to block activity during an \nauditory task where\nsubjects needed to respond when they heard a target tone or \nin a visual task\nwhere they responded to the blurring of a flashing checkerboard. \nFor all points\nin the meta-analysis, all fMRI comparisons were between \ntask and baseline\n(i.e., fixation cross) and were preprocessed with global \nsignal correction. Further,\nduring the preprocessing of the data, \nit is spatially normalized to MNI\ntemplate space. Normalized task specific \n\u201ccon\u201d images reflecting the\ntask-related BOLD activity change from baseline \nwere computed with SPM99 for\nall individuals in each dataset. These individual \n\u201ccon\u201d images were then\naveraged within age group for each study resulting in a \ntotal of 8 average BOLD\nactivity maps (2 age groups over 4 tasks). \nThis process emulated the\nconstruction of a traditional Brinley plot which averaged \nthe response times\nfor each task within each age group. \nWithin the BOLD average signal maps, each\nvoxel contains a value representing the age \ngroup's average BOLD activity for\nthat task at that standardized MNI   \ncoordinate. \n\nUsing the 4 average young maps as observed  -values and\nthe corresponding 4 average older adult maps as observed \n -values, a linear\nregression analysis   was calculated \nwithin each voxel that contained\nat least 3   data points (see   for \na representative voxel). Individual 3D maps were computed that contained \nvoxels with individual\nregression parameters of interest (e.g., slope, b-intercept, \nR-square, predicted  -value, etc.). \nSince the null hypothesis H  in question was whether or\nnot there was equivalent change between young and older \nadults across tasks,\nthe slope value for H  was 1. To evaluate \nH  :  , the\nabsolute residual values were calculated at each data point in \nSPM2  . \nThe resulting 8 residual maps (2\nage groups over 4 tasks) were then statistically compared \nusing a t-test in\nSPM. When the n is large enough, theoretically, \nit would be more statistically\ncorrect to analyze the difference between these residuals with \na paired t-test.\nIf the null hypothesis was true, \nthen the absolute residual values would be\nequal and not statistically different from each other \n . \nIf the slope was not equal to 1, then the\nvoxel's t-test would be significant \n .\nMultiple comparisons were controlled for by using FWE of \n  < 0.05 and an\nextent threshold of at least 3 consecutive voxels. \nThe sign (+ or \u2212) and value of\nthe slope could then be assessed to determine how \nthe two groups deviated in \ntheir BOLD signals across the tasks plotted in the analysis \n(e.g., one group activates an area more across tasks then the other group). \n\nAs graciously pointed out by an anonymous reviewer, \nslopes of \u22121 should not be considered as\npart of the null hypothesis, since the direction of \nactivity across tasks for\nthe age groups would actually be opposite \n(i.e., young adults activating across\ntasks while older adults deactivate). \nTherefore, it is also important to\ninvestigate areas where the slope is significantly negative, \nsince the above\n\u201cresidual\u201d analysis would not just eliminate slopes \nof +1 but also slopes which\nwere not significantly different from \u22121. \nAn example of this can be seen in the\nplotted data of   \nin which this particular voxel would not be significant\nin the above \u201cresidual\u201d analysis, but still \nrepresents an interesting result. Significant\nvoxels with a slope of \u22121 can be identified using the \n -value \nof the regression\nused to fit the Peiffer plot \n(i.e.,   < .05 for the slope to be different from\nzero). Three contiguous voxels with a significant regression \n -value \nand a negative slope will be \nconsidered a cluster of interest as well. \n\nTo evaluate a significant voxel's b-intercept, \nthe 95% confidence interval was assessed. If this interval\ncontained zero, the voxel's b-intercept was considered \nnot to deviate from\nzero. Again, b-intercept clusters were considered \nsignificant if they contained\nat lest 3 contiguous voxels with significantly nonzero \nb-intercepts. \n\n\n## 3. RESULTS \n  \nThe traditional Brinley plot using average response times \nacross the 4 tasks included in the fMRI meta-analysis showed the established \ndifferences between young and older adults \n(see  ). \nThe slope of 1.4 supports general\ncognitive slowing within the dataset even though \nrelatively simple response\ntime tasks were used, and although uninterpretable \nfor response time data, the\nnegative b-intercept is also typical. With a slope \ngreater than one, older\nadults had greater differences between \ntasks in response time than younger\nadults. \n\nFor the fMRI meta-analysis, five distinct clusters \nsurvived the stringent correction applied\nfor multiple comparisons. The location of these clusters \nis summarized visually\nin   and details \nare given in Table 1\n. \nClusters of interest to competing\ntheories of general cognitive slowing were \nfound within the left pre- and\npostcentral gyrus areas as well as within the right \nmedial frontal gyrus. All\nclusters identified in the analysis had, on average, \na slope that was\nsignificantly less than one yet significantly greater \nthan negative one (see  ). \nThis slope indicates that between these 4 tasks, younger \nadults had greater BOLD signal change than older adults \nin these brain areas. Notably,\nthere is a lack of difference in between-task BOLD activity \nwithin primary\nsensory areas such as vision between older and younger adults, \neven though several studies have reported older adults \nhaving less activity than younger\nadults in sensory areas \n[ \u2013 ]. \n\nWhen the Peiffer plot was explored for 3 contiguous\nvoxels with significantly negative slopes less than zero, \n19 total clusters were identified. Nine of these \nclusters (47%) were located within the right\nmiddle and superior frontal gyri and included a total of \n68\u2009voxels (see  ). \nAcross these clusters older adults showed BOLD deactivation on \ntasks when younger adults tended to slightly activate and \nolder adults had BOLD activation\nwhen younger adults were deactivating on a task \n(average slope \u22121.89 +/\u2212 0.21).\nThese areas appear to be activating in opposition between \nthe age groups and\nare contiguous to the right middle frontal gyrus area \n(cluster no. 4) identified\nin the \u201cresidual\u201d analysis. \nOther clusters, showing similar activity\ndifferences were seen within left medial frontal gyrus \n(2 clusters; 6\u2009voxels);\nleft inferior parietal lobule (3 clusters; 10\u2009voxels); \ncingulate gyrus (2 clusters; 7\u2009voxels); \nand single clusters within the basal ganglia (5\u2009voxels),\nmidbrain (3\u2009voxels), and the left posterior \nlobe of the cerebellum (7\u2009voxels).\nIt is important to note, however, that these findings, \nunlike those from the \u201cresidual\u201d\nanalysis above, have not been stringently controlled for \nmultiple comparisons\naside from retaining the requirement for 3 contiguous voxels. \n\nTo assess whether these slope findings were dependent \non age and not an epiphenomenon of the\ndatasets, a randomization of the age groups was \nperformed within each dataset.\nIndividuals were randomized in two groups so that the average \nage of both\ngroups was roughly equal (  \u223c  51 years of age). \nWhen the Peiffer plot was\nconstructed for these new groups, no significant clusters were \nidentified where\nthe null hypothesis (H  :  ) \nwas false. Additonally, no significant\nareas were identified where the slope was \u22121. \nThese findings thus support the\nclaim that the results of the original plot \nwere not due to the dataset\ncomposition (i.e., scanner, site, or paradigm) \nbut were dependent on separating\nthe study populations by age. \n\nAssessment of\nthe b-intercept indicated that the lack of significant \nslopes within the\nprimary sensory areas may be due to a baseline shift in activity \nbetween the\nage groups (see  ). \nFor example, within visual cortex, several areas were\nidentified that had negative b-intercepts which \nindicated that across the tasks\nolder adults tended to start from a lower BOLD \nactivity level than young adults\n(if  , then \n  negative BOLD signal). \nThis result is a continual within-task\ndifference, which is also seen in the published literature \n[ \u2013 ]; however, since this reduced\nBOLD signal in older adults is constant across several tasks, \nit does not have\na slope which deviates significantly from 1. \nIn addition, an area within right\nmotor cortex shows a positive b-intercept and thus greater \nactivity in older\nadults relative to younger adults. \nAs graciously pointed out by an anonymous\nreviewer, this result is consistent with the model hypothesis \nof hemispheric asymmetry\nin older adults (HAROLD). \nThe HAROLD model states that there is reduced\nlateralization of brain activity in older adults \nrelative to younger adults,\nwhich results from changes in neural architecture \nand not cognitive strategy \n[ , \n ]. Due to the small number of\ndata points used to construct these plots, \nthe area included within the 95% confidence\ninterval of the b-intercept is relatively large. \nTherefore, these early\nfindings may underestimate the amount of brain activity \nwhich could be\ndescribed as being affected by an age-related \nDC-shift and is thus an\nage-related BOLD signal difference that is independent of task. \n\nFinally, an epiphenomenon of the method was \nrevealed when evaluating the goodness of fit,\nas measured by the R-squared value. \nAreas where the slope was similar to one\nshowed very high R-squared values (>0.8) \nsuggesting a high predictability\nfor older adults' BOLD signal in several \nbrain regions; however, within the\nclusters identified as significantly deviant \nfrom one, R-squared values were\nlower and ranged between 0.1\u20130.46. \n\n\n## 4. DISCUSSION \n  \nHere we report the preliminary use of a \nnovel meta-analysis technique in studies on\naging, which localizes one factor of general \ncognitive slowing to the\nsensorimotor transfer. These findings lend support to \nexisting data from\nevent-related potential work indicating that \nslowing occurs predominately\nduring the time for generation of the response in older \nadults and not when evaluating\nincoming sensory material \n[ , \n ]. Deviant slopes could be\nfound in between-task BOLD activity values where younger \nadults have greater\nBOLD activity change than older adults in the \nsensorimotor transfer area in the\nleft hemisphere. Additionally, right frontal \nareas were identified with slopes\nnear \u22121, indicating that older and younger \nadults were activating these\nattentional areas in opposite directions across the tasks. \nNot surprisingly,\nmore attentionally demanding tasks have shown \nthat older adults have\ndifferential patterns of activation within the \nfrontal cortex in response to the\ntask when compared to younger participants \n[ , \n ]. \n\nAn important caveat exists, however, \nsince datasets within this analysis were obtained from\nrelatively noncognitively demanding tasks. \nIn other words, more brain areas\nmay be involved as loci of general cognitive \nslowing and would emerge as more\ncognitively demanding datasets become available for assessment. \nComparing our\ncurrent datasets to the existing literature on Brinley plots of \nreaction times,\nsimple discrimination tasks show the least amount of response \ntime slowing;\ntherefore, these BOLD signal findings presumably will only \nbecome stronger with\nthe addition of datasets containing more cognitively demanding \nconditions\n(e.g., working memory). In addition, with more tasks requiring \ngreater attentional demand, the negative slope found within right \nfrontal cortex may\nsteepen and be found within the residual analysis which \ncan control for the\nmultiple comparisons inherent within imaging data. \nPower analyses of these\npreliminary results suggest that roughly 9 datasets are needed to \nperform a meta-analysis with a paired t-test to achieve a \npower-level of 80%. \n\nInterestingly, all\nsignificant clusters identified as deviant within the \nmeta-analysis were\nseparate from peak activity differences reported in any of the \nindividual tasks\nused within the datasets. \nIf traditional meta-analysis techniques were used \n[ \u2013 ], none of these areas would\nhave been found. Utilizing this novel meta-analysis technique, \nit is possible\nto assess between-task differences in BOLD activity between \ngroups regardless\nof paradigm design, task parameters, and location of the scan. \nWhile global\nsignal correction was used to normalize \nthe datasets within this study, the\nassessment method could also be performed using \naverage group z-maps that would\nallow datasets from multiple fMRI processing software \npackages to be analyzed\ncollectively. Additionally, this method may yield \ninteresting findings in a\nvariety of study groups where a clear \u201cnormal\u201d \ngroup can be identified and used\non the  -axis \n(e.g., schizophrenics versus normals; \ndyslexics versus normals; AD versus\nnormal older adults). It is important to keep in mind that \nthe use of this\nmethod is to determine between-task differences among \ntwo populations and not\nto differentiate the two groups within any one paradigm \nof the analysis. Thus,\ndifferences in whether or not an area is \nidentified as deviant come from how\nthe BOLD signal responds across a wide array of tasks. \n\nAn existing disadvantage of this meta-analysis technique \nis that it requires access to raw\nfMRI data to obtain subjects' normalized contrast \nweighted BOLD activity maps\n(task - baseline) from multiple tasks. With the\ncontinued increase of complete data sets maintained in \naccessible repositories\nlike the fMRI Data Center, this should\nhopefully become less burdensome in the near future. \n\nOverall as a meta-analysis method in the fMRI field, \nthis plotting addresses several\nlimitations of existing analysis methods. \nSpecifically, it allows the\nassessment of between-task differences regardless of a \ntask's paradigm domain\nor baseline condition. Further, it can identify \nareas of subthreshold effects\nin addition to the suprathreshold \nwithin-task differences that are identified\nby performing a meta-analysis on voxel quadrants \nidentified in individual\nstudies as the local maxima. Lastly, this method \nprovides imaging researchers\nthe ability to localize between-task differences \nin BOLD signal and apply that\nknowledge to existing behavioral evidence not only in aging but \nin other complex conditions \n(e.g., dyslexia, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, etc.)\nas well. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 2233772, "text_md5": "722823d3667bf43d22773b8a72ef9730", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 62], "journal": [63, 83], "publication_year": [85, 89], "title": [100, 206], "keywords": [220, 220], "abstract": [233, 1277], "body": [1286, 21924]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 18274664, "doi": "10.1155/2008/167078", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2233772", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=2233772"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2233772\">2233772</a>", "list_title": "PMC2233772  Resurrecting Brinley Plots for a Novel Use: Meta-Analyses of Functional Brain Imaging Data in Older Adults"}
