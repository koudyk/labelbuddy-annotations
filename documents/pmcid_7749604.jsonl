In addition to a limited number of subjects (<20) tested with different methodologies and stimuli, inconsistent reports of the brain regions involved have been a major factor. Thus, we conducted a meta\u2010analysis of 12 peer\u2010reviewed studies of abnormal brain activation regions in PSA patients at rest using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA meta\u2010analysis was performed based on 24 experiments with 497 total participants in 12 studies to establish the ALE of regional activation in PSA. Through experiments with PSA patients and healthy controls, we found that hypoactivation in PSA converged on the left superior frontal gyrus and the left parietal postcentral gyrus, whereas there was hyperactivation in the right cerebellar anterior lobe, left fusiform gyrus, left superior parietal lobule, and right subgyral hippocampus. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur study verified that dominant and nondominant language networks play roles in the recovery of language function. \n\n  \nAlthough the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of poststroke aphasia (PSA) is greatly concerned, it remains unclear. By coordinate\u2010based (ALE) meta\u2010analysis, we found that the activation of the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and the parietal postcentral gyrus of PSA presented hypoactivation, while there was hyperactivation in the right cerebellar anterior lobe, fusiform gyrus, superior temporal gyrus (STG), superior parietal lobule (SPL), and subgyral hippocampus. It is worth noting that the changed functional status of area in brain is more involved in right lobe. The future studies on rehabilitation should be given more attention to the right area.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nLanguage impairment is one of the clinical manifestations of stroke. The estimated prevalence of poststroke aphasia (PSA) ranges from 21% to 38% (Berthier,\u00a0 ). Patients with PSA suffer not only isolated social emotions (Kauhanen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), depression (Bullier et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), and low quality of life (Wang et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) but also speech impairment. Speech impairment may be improved by using cortical stimulation or pharmacotherapy. However, half of PSA patients recover much or all of their language function. The remainders are left with persistent and disabling impairment of communication (Geranmayeh et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nWith the advent of neuroimaging, many studies have investigated the abnormal regional activity and functional connectivity (FC) of PSA (Guo et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Mayorova et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Sandberg,\u00a0 ; Yang et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Zhu et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). However, the results of these studies are inconsistent because of small samples (<20 patients) and variable analysis methods. For example, Yang et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ) investigated the mechanism underlying PSA with a combination of structural alternations of gray matter volume and intrinsic functional MRI. They found that increased activation of remote interregional functional connection was located between the right IPL/SMG and right precuneus, right angular gyrus, and right superior occipital gyrus. The reduced activity was located at the right caudate gyrus and supplementary motor area and dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus. However, Fridriksson et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ) studied brain activation associated with correct picture naming in 15 patients with aphasia. Their study revealed that the increased activation was preserved in the left hemisphere areas only. In their study, no reduced activity was found. These different findings are possibly due to the different research methods. Furthermore, Yang et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ) examined changes in the local synchronization of spontaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygen level\u2010dependent fluctuations in PSA at rest. They found that decreased intrinsic local synchronization was located in the right lingual gyrus, the left calcarine, the left cuneus, the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and the left medial of SFG in PSA patients. They also found that local synchronization in the left medial SFG was positively correlated with aphasia severity and naming scores on the Chinese Standard Aphasia Battery. In all, the results of neural imaging studies are hard to reach consensus. \n\nTo overcome this problem, we performed an activated likelihood estimation (ALE) meta\u2010analysis to study the convergence of the activated brain regions in PSA patients and HCs using rs\u2010fMRI. The ALE approach can be used to integrate the reported coordinates of activation maxima from published studies to identify regions of significant converging activation (Warren et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). This approach has two advantages: We can take whole pictures of brain activation differences between PSA patients and healthy controls, and we can study relatively larger samples. This study is expected to contribute to further understanding of the pathology of PSA. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Literature search and selection criteria \n  \nIn May 2020, the relevant studies were identified through a systematic online database search for peer\u2010reviewed articles on Web of Science, PubMed, and Elsevier. The searches were conducted with the keywords \u201cstroke\u201d or \u201capoplexy\u201d or \u201ccerebralvascular accident\u201d or \u201ccerebral infarction\u201d or \u201ccerebral haemorrhage\u201d, \u201caphasia\u201d, \u201cresting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201crs\u2010fMRI\u201d. The retrieval formula was (\u201cstroke\u201d [Mesh Terms] OR apoplexy OR cerebralvascular accident OR \u201ccerebral infarction\u201d [Mesh Terms] OR \u201ccerebral haemorrhage\u201d [Mesh Terms]) AND (\u201caphasia\u201d[Mesh Terms]) AND (resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging OR rs\u2010fMRI). \n\nFirst, 568 articles were obtained from the initial screening. Twenty\u2010seven duplicated articles were removed because they were duplicated. Then, 541 potential studies were further assessed according to the following criteria: (a) The study included PSA patients, (b) the study used rs\u2010fMRI, (c) the coordinates in the selected studies were in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) (Collins et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Evans et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) space or Talairach space (Talairach,\u00a0 ), (d) the studies were written in English, (e) the studies were research articles, (f) the reports contain comparisons between the PSA group and health controls, and the PSA patients did not receive an intervention, and (g) quantitative whole\u2010brain analyses were performed. Reports with ROI analyses were excluded. Finally, a total of 12 relevant rs\u2010fMRI studies were included in the final meta\u2010analysis, which included 270 healthy participants and 227 stroke survivors. Table\u00a0  illustrates the socio\u2010demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects included in the selected studies. The retrieval process of each selected study is shown in Figure\u00a0 , and the methodological characteristics are shown in Table\u00a0 . \n  \nSocio\u2010demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects included in the selected studies \n      \nThe literature search and the process of inclusion or exclusion of articles \n    \nAll studies entered into the meta\u2010analysis are listed, including year, first author, stereotactic space, neuroimaging, imaging method, and active contrast conditions \n    \n\n### Activation likelihood estimation meta\u2010analysis \n  \nAn ALE meta\u2010analysis was performed using GingerALE software (Eickhoffet al.,\u00a0 ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ) using the most recent users\u2019 manual ( ). In the ALE meta\u2010analysis of single datasets, we connected the coordinates from the rs\u2010fMRI studies showing \u201cHC\u00a0>\u00a0PSA\u201d and \u201cHC\u00a0<\u00a0PSA.\u201d The ALE map was computed with   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05 FEW cluster\u2010corrected thresholds with 1,000 permutations (Collins et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). According to the manual, this threshold is the most conservative and appropriate level. Resulting ALE maps were visualized by Mango software 4.0.1 (The University of Texas, Austin TX, USA) with the Colin brain template in MNI space ( ). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Brain regions with greater activation among HCs than among PSA patients \n  \nCompared with the HCs, PSA involved lower activation in the left SFG (BA8,   x  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221212,   y  \u00a0=\u00a044,   z\u00a0  =\u00a048) and the left parietal postcentral gyrus (BA3,   x  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221220,   y  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221230,   z\u00a0  =\u00a078) (see Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nResults of ALE analysis of different brain activation regions with HC\u00a0>\u00a0PSA and HC\u00a0<\u00a0PSA during resting\u2010state functional studies \n      \nSignificant results from the meta\u2010analysis of HC\u00a0>\u00a0PSA and HC\u00a0<\u00a0PSA during rs\u2010fMRI brain activation (FWE\u2010corrected\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

L, left; R, right \n  \n\n### Brain regions with lower activation among HCs than among PSA patients \n  \nAs demonstrated in Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 , the direct comparison between HCs and PSA patients revealed that the latter had more activation peaks in the right cerebellar anterior lobe (  x  \u00a0=\u00a012,   y  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221263,   z\u00a0  =\u00a0\u221224), left fusiform gyrus (BA37,   x  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221248,   y  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221264,   z\u00a0  =\u00a0\u221212), left SPL (BA7,   x  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221216,   y  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221248,   z\u00a0  =\u00a066), and right subgyral hippocampus (  x  \u00a0=\u00a032,   y  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221220,   z\u00a0  =\u00a0\u221212). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn the present study, ALE meta\u2010analysis was used to compare brain activation regions involved in PSA relative to HCs in rs\u2010fMRI. The first analysis of coordinates of resting\u2010state activation in PSA patients showed converged hypoactivation in the left SFG and left parietal postcentral gyrus. The second analysis found converged hyperactivation of brain areas including the right cerebella anterior lobe, left fusiform gyrus, left SPL, and right subgyral hippocampus. \n\nThe decreased activation in the left SFG (BA8 and left parietal postcentral gyrus (BA3) has been reported in several functional neuroimaging studies on stroke patients (Kang & Kim,\u00a0 ; Tohgi et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). The SFG was used for spatial analysis of working memory (Boisgueheneuc et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) and was used to process phonological or vocabulary search tasks (Tohgi et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Tonkonogy & Goodglass,\u00a0 ). In our results, the reduced activation of the SFG in PSA was consistent with the patients' speech fluency and lexical dysphonia. The parietal postcentral gyrus has been considered an important region of somatosensory (Corkin et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) and writing abilities (Magrassi et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Furthermore, in terms of FC, G\u00f3mez, Flores, and Ledesma ( ) found a strong correlation between the left parietal postcentral gyrus and the SFG, which suggests that frontoparietal networks in extensive processing of information during language production. \n\nConverged hyperactivation was observed in the left fusiform gyrus (BA37) and subgyral hippocampus. A similar result has been found in previous rs\u2010fMRI studies that observed the activated regions during the changes to 17 PSA brain functions (Yang et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Based on visual picture\u2010naming and auditory\u2010naming tasks to evaluate the cortical structure and dynamics of lexical semantic networks in driving speech production, the authors found that a distinct neuroanatomical substrate in the fusiform gyrus provided access to object semantic information (Forseth et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 )]. Furthermore, the authors found that compared with HCs, PSA patients displayed hyperactivation of the left fusiform gyrus in a resting state, which may be related to the compensatory mechanism of semantic processing. The correlation suggested that the activity in the contralateral parahippocampus may mediate functional recovery of the right homologous language regions (Li\u00e9geois et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Thus, the fusiform gyrus is very important for aphasia language recovery. \n\nConverged hyperactivation during a resting state in SPA was also observed in the cerebellar right anterior lobe and the SPL. A previous rs\u2010fMRI study, which found increased activation of the bilateral cerebellum and ipsilesional superior parietal lobe during measuring the dynamic amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuations (dALFF) in patients with subacute stroke, reported similar results (Chen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). The cerebellum was involved in the articulation, visual space, and executive power (Stoodley & Schmahmann,\u00a0 ), whereas the parietal lobe was associated with writing and cognitive function (Bzdok et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Magrassi et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). A study that measured brain metabolism in PSA showed diffuse hypometabolism in the ipsilateral parietal area and contralateral cerebellum (Kim et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Such results suggested that the cerebellum and parietal activation indicate the patients\u2019 potential for further language improvement. Therefore, the right cerebellar anterior lobe and the SPL were closely related to language recovery in PSA. \n\n\n## LIMITATIONS \n  \nThis study had several limitations. First, this study is a meta\u2010analysis of limited literature and may be affected by potential publication bias of invalid results. Second, ALE analysis cannot clarify the temporal dynamics of language changes in PSA patients. Third, this study included the literature using rs\u2010fMRI and did not include PET research. Therefore, future studies should strive to incorporate PET\u2010reported brain activation coordinates to explore abnormal activation regions in real\u2010world situations closer to aphasia patients. \n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nThe present study employed a meta\u2010analysis approach to map the convergence of abnormally activated brain areas in PSA. Our ALE meta\u2010analysis revealed that compared with HCs, PSA hypoactivation converged in the SFG and parietal postcentral gyrus, whereas hyperactivation occurred in the right cerebellar anterior lobe, fusiform gyrus, SPL, and subgyral hippocampus. Our study verified that dominant and nondominant language networks play roles in the recovery of language function. This study contributes to a better understanding of brain activation in PSA in the resting state. Moreover, our findings play an important role in understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of aphasia, creating rehabilitation strategies and predicting the effect of rehabilitation. \n\n\n## DISCLOSURES \n  \nThere was no conflict of interest to declare. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION \n  \nYing Du took part in the whole process of research and was responsible for literature search and essay writing.
