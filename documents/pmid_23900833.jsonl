The meta-analysis of 75 independent studies included a comparison of auditory and visual oddball effects and task-relevant and task-irrelevant oddball effects. The results were interpreted with reference to the model in which a large-scale dorsal frontoparietal network embodies a mechanism for orienting attention to the environment, whereas a large-scale ventral frontoparietal network supports the detection of salient, environmental changes. The meta-analysis yielded three main sets of findings. First, ventral network regions were strongly associated with oddball effects and largely common to auditory and visual modalities, indicating a supramodal \"alerting\" system. Most ventral network components were more strongly associated with task-relevant than task-irrelevant oddball effects, indicating a dynamic interplay of stimulus saliency and internal goals in stimulus-driven engagement of the network. Second, the bilateral inferior frontal junction, an anterior core of the dorsal network, was strongly associated with oddball effects, suggesting a central role in top-down attentional control. However, other dorsal network regions showed no or only modest association with oddball effects, likely reflecting active engagement during both oddball and standard stimulus processing. Finally, prominent oddball effects outside the two networks included the sensory cortex regions, likely reflecting attentive and preattentive modulation of early sensory activity, and subcortical regions involving the putamen, thalamus, and other areas, likely reflecting subcortical involvement in alerting responses.
