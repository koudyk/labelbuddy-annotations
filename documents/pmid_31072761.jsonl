We searched PubMed for all neuroimaging studies examining cognitive training in schizophrenia published until December 2018. An activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis was conducted on a subset of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies to examine whether any brain regions showed consistent effects across studies.

Although several studies reported increased left prefrontal cortical activation after cognitive training, the lack of statistically significant overlap of brain regions affected by training across studies suggests broad effects of training on brain activation, possibly due to the variety of training programs used.
