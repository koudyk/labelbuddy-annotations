However, less is known about brain regions associated with non-conscious processing of faces, and whether a right-hemispheric dominance persists in line with specific affective responses. We aim to review the neural responses systematically, quantitatively, and qualitatively underlying subliminal face processing. PubMed was searched for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) publications assessing subliminal emotional face stimuli up to March 2022. Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analyses and narrative reviews were conducted on all studies that met ALE requirements. Risk of bias was assessed using the AXIS tool. In a meta-analysis of all 22 eligible studies (merging clinical and non-clinical populations, whole brain and region of interest analyses), bilateral amygdala activation was reported in the left (x = -19.2, y = 1.5, z = -17.1) in 59% of studies, and in the right (x = 24.4, y = -1.7, z = -17.4) in 68% of studies. In a second meta-analysis of non-clinical participants only ( ", "metadata": {"id": 35924231, "text_md5": "72b6fb190280bc0e9a005184baffcb61", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 81], "journal": [82, 96], "publication_year": [98, 102], "title": [113, 243], "keywords": [257, 347], "abstract": [360, 1498], "body": [1507, 1507]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 35924231, "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2022.868366", "pmid_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35924231/", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pubmed&id=35924231"}, "display_title": "pmid: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35924231/\">35924231</a>", "list_title": "PMID35924231  Subliminal Emotional Faces Elicit Predominantly Right-Lateralized Amygdala Activation: A Systematic Meta-Analysis of fMRI Studies."}
