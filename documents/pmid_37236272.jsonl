Evidence that IAS is activated by subliminal trauma-reminders could shed a new light on the factors precipitating and perpetuating PTSD symptomatology. Thus, we systematically reviewed studies investigating neuroimaging correlates of subliminal stimulation in PTSD. Twenty-three studies were selected from the MEDLINE and Scopus\u00ae databases for a qualitative synthesis, 5 of which allowed a further meta-analysis of fMRI data. The intensity of IAS responses to subliminal trauma-related reminders ranged from a minimum in healthy controls to a maximum in the PTSD patients with the most severe (e.g., dissociative) symptoms or the least responsiveness to treatment. Comparisons with other disorders (e.g., phobias) revealed contrasting results. Our findings demonstrate the hyperactivation of areas belonging or related to IAS in response to unconscious threats that should be integrated in diagnostic as well as in therapeutic protocols.
