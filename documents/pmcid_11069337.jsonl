However, the inter\u2010individual variability in functional networks and brain function\u2010structural dissociations pose challenges when relying solely on group\u2010level atlases or anatomical landmarks for surgical guidance. Here, we aimed to develop and validate a personalized functional mapping technique for verbal memory using precision resting\u2010state functional MRI (rs\u2010fMRI) and neurosurgery. A total of 38 patients with refractory epilepsy scheduled for surgical interventions were enrolled and 28 patients were analyzed in the study. Baseline 30\u2010min rs\u2010fMRI scanning, verbal memory and language assessments were collected for each patient before surgery. Personalized verbal memory networks (PVMN) were delineated based on preoperative rs\u2010fMRI data for each patient. The accuracy of PVMN was assessed by comparing post\u2010operative functional impairments and the overlapping extent between PVMN and surgical lesions. A total of 14 out of 28 patients experienced clinically meaningful declines in verbal memory after surgery. The personalized network and the group\u2010level atlas exhibited 100% and 75.0% accuracy in predicting postoperative verbal memory declines, respectively. Moreover, six patients with extra\u2010temporal lesions that overlapped with PVMN showed selective impairments in verbal memory. Furthermore, the lesioned ratio of the personalized network rather than the group\u2010level atlas was significantly correlated with postoperative declines in verbal memory (personalized networks:   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.39,   p  \u2009=\u2009.038; group\u2010level atlas:   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.19,   p  \u2009=\u2009.332). In conclusion, our personalized functional mapping technique, using precision rs\u2010fMRI, offers valuable insights into individual variability in the verbal memory network and holds promise in precision verbal memory network mapping in individuals. \n  \nWe used precision resting\u2010state functional MRI to map personalized verbal memory network (PVMN) for each treatment\u2010resistant epilepsy patient. PVMN, instead of group\u2010level functional atlases, effectively predicted post\u2010operative verbal memory impairments according to its spatial overlap with surgical lesions, indicating the precision PVMN mapping in individuals.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nPresurgical planning plays a critical role in optimizing neurosurgical outcomes, with the aim to remove pathological areas while ensuring the maximum preservation of surrounding critical functional regions. Epilepsy neurosurgeries, such as anterior temporal lobe resections, achieve high remission rates (de Tisi et al.,\u00a0 ), but carry a significant risk of postoperative declines in verbal memory (Binder,\u00a0 ; Sidhu et al.,\u00a0 ), which may greatly impair the quality of life of patients (Bell et al.,\u00a0 ; Langfitt et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nConsiderable efforts have been dedicated to identifying predictive factors for postoperative verbal memory impairment (Binder et al.,\u00a0 ; Busch et al.,\u00a0 ; Sidhu et al.,\u00a0 ), contributing to our understanding of potential postoperative outcomes. In addition to prognostic predictions, determining the optimal extent of surgical resection is crucial for presurgical decision\u2010making. Several retrospective studies have proposed empirical guidelines for clinical practice based on anatomical landmarks (Sone et al.,\u00a0 ; Szaflarski et al.,\u00a0 ). However, due to significant inter\u2010individual variability in the functional organization of higher\u2010order cognition (Li et al.,\u00a0 ; Mueller et al.,\u00a0 ; Ren, Xu, et al.,\u00a0 ), such as verbal memory (Kim et al.,\u00a0 ), and the existence of functional idiosyncrasies that extend beyond anatomical restrictions (Li et al.,\u00a0 ; Nenning et al.,\u00a0 ), the precision delineation of a personalized functional margin for verbal memory becomes critical for optimal presurgical decision\u2010making aimed at preserving verbal memory. Moreover, the personalized mapping may also offer unique contributions to the accurate prediction of functional outcomes. \n\nRecently, increasing attention has been given to the involvement of extra\u2010temporal brain regions in verbal memory processing, alongside the well\u2010established focus on focal surgical lesions within the temporal lobe (Sidhu et al.,\u00a0 ; Sidhu et al.,\u00a0 ). From a brain network perspective, these temporal and extra\u2010temporal regions are likely interconnected, given that the human brain is functionally organized into multiple distributed functional networks (Yeo et al.,\u00a0 ). Consequently, lesions occurring in any brain region within the functional network could lead to corresponding functional impairments (Fox,\u00a0 ). Despite this, the specific characteristics and functional significance of the verbal memory network still remain understudied. \n\nRecent advancements in precision resting\u2010state functional MRI (rs\u2010fMRI) have demonstrated significant potential in facilitating reliable and accurate personalized functional network mapping (Gordon et al.,\u00a0 ; Gordon et al.,\u00a0 ). Rs\u2010fMRI simply requires patients remaining still without engaging in any specific cognitive tasks, is generally better tolerated by patients, particularly those who have impairments in verbal memory. Furthermore, the personalized functional network mapping derived from task\u2010free fMRI data could unveil individual differences in task activations (Gordon et al.,\u00a0 ; Gordon et al.,\u00a0 ; Tavor et al.,\u00a0 ) and has been validated through invasive approaches (Cui et al.,\u00a0 ; Smith et al.,\u00a0 ; Wang et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe objective of this study is to develop and validate a personalized functional network mapping technique for verbal memory using precision rs\u2010fMRI, aiming to provide a complementary tool for presurgical decision\u2010making. To achieve this, we delineated a personalized verbal memory network (PVMN) based on each patient's presurgical rs\u2010fMRI data. Moreover, we assessed the spatial overlap between the surgical lesion and the personalized network to predict the likelihood and extent of functional impairments. This personalized approach may offer valuable insights into preserving verbal memory and serves as an important aid in presurgical planning. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nPatients diagnosed with refectory epilepsy were recruited from The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University (FAH\u2010FMU) between 2019 and 2021. The inclusion criteria for participant selection were as follows: (1) age ranging from 16 to 60\u2009years old; (2) presence of at least one treatment\u2010resistant epileptic focus located within the temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, or the parietal lobe; (3) right\u2010handedness determined using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory; and (4) scheduled for surgical intervention, such as temporal lobe resection or radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF\u2010TC), following completion of multimodal preoperative assessment, which involved scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), cranial MRI, and/or brain positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET\u2010CT). Exclusion criteria included the presence of: (1) space\u2010occupying lesions before the surgeries; (2) contraindications to undergoing MRI examinations; or (3) cognitive impairments impeding the ability to cooperate with neuropsychological cognitive assessments. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of FAH\u2010FMU. All patients or their caregivers were informed of the precautions before enrollment and signed the informed consent. \n\n\n### Neuropsychological assessments \n  \nAll participants included in the study underwent baseline assessments of verbal memory and language prior to their respective surgical procedures. Post\u2010operative assessments were conducted within 1\u20132\u2009weeks following the surgeries. The specific timing of these assessments was determined by physicians and experienced assessors, ensuring that patients' post\u2010operative conditions had sufficiently stabilized to facilitate their participation in neuropsychological evaluations. The choice of a relatively short post\u2010operative interval was deliberate, aimed at achieving a balance between mitigating potential confounding effects stemming from functional reorganization processes that may evolve over time as a consequence of surgical lesions and ensuring the stable recovery conditions of patients after surgery. In addition, pre\u2010 and post\u2010operative evaluations were performed by the same experienced assessors to minimize potential evaluation biases. \n\nVerbal memory function was evaluated using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), which assessed both immediate and delayed recall (Schmidt,\u00a0 ). The score of the AVLT immediate recall (AVLT\u2010immediate) was determined based on the number of correctly recalled words from the 5\u2010time repeated 15\u2010word vocabulary list, with a maximum score of 75. Following a 30\u2010min interval, the list was recalled once more to assess the participants' delayed memory retrieval ability. The score of the AVLT delayed recall (AVLT\u2010delayed) was also calculated based on the number of correctly recalled words, with a maximum score of 15. AVLT\u2010delayed score is particularly critical for evaluating the consolidation and retention aspects of verbal memory (Alpherts et al.,\u00a0 ; Cotton & Ricker,\u00a0 ). This includes remembering important information after a lapse in time, which measures the practical memory challenge that patients may face in daily experiences. Therefore, we focused on the AVLT\u2010delayed score for the main analyses. To address the concern of whether changes in a test score for an individual patient are statistically reliable or merely due to measurement error in clinical settings, we used the reliable change index (RCI) as the cutoff value to determine whether there was a decline in verbal memory or not. A clinically meaningful decline in verbal memory was defined as a decrease of 4 points or more in the AVLT\u2010delayed score after surgery compared to baseline, determined using the RCI (Busch et al.,\u00a0 ; Sawrie et al.,\u00a0 ). To examine whether the observed declines were specific to verbal memory rather than being influenced by language impairment, we also assessed their language abilities served as a control in our study. Language assessment was conducted using the Chinese version of the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), a comprehensive evaluation tool for language impairment (Kertesz & Poole,\u00a0 ). The WAB aphasia quotient (WAB\u2010AQ) was used as a summarized score, ranging from 0 to 100, to assess overall language function. A 5\u2010point change is regarded as a clinically significant change (Godecke et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nDuring the interval from the surgeries to post\u2010operative assessments, no post\u2010operative complications that could affected the cognitive performance occurred in any of the 28 patients. All patients were seizure\u2010free during the interval and their pre\u2010operative seizure frequencies showed no differences between patients with and without AVLT\u2010delayed (two\u2010sample   t  \u2010test,   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.38,   p  \u2009=\u2009.71), thereby minimizing the possibility of cognitive performance being impacted by seizures. Following surgery, we maintained the type and dosage of anti\u2010seizure medications that patients were prescribed prior to the operation. Within one\u2010week post\u2010surgery, all patients were able to adhere to their medication regimen from before the surgery. Furthermore, no medications known to potentially cause cognitive impairment were administered during this period, thus eliminating the possibility of medication changes influencing cognitive scores. \n\n\n###  MRI   data acquisition \n  \nParticipants underwent structural and functional MRI scanning before surgeries. MRI data were collected using a Skyra 3.0T MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 32\u2010channel head coil at the FAH\u2010FMU. High\u2010resolution T1\u2010weighted (T1w) anatomical images were acquired using an MPRAGE 3D T1w sequence (TR\u2009=\u20092300\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u20093.09\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u20099\u00b0, FOV\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 matrix, 192 sagittal slices, and voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm ). Additionally, high\u2010resolution T2w images were acquired using the 3D T2w fluid\u2010attenuated inversion recovery sequence (TR\u2009=\u20095000\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u2009387\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009230\u2009\u00d7\u2009230, 230\u2009\u00d7\u2009230 matrix, 192 sagittal slices, and voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009mm ). Rs\u2010fMRI was acquired with an echo planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence (TR\u2009=\u20093000\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240, 80\u2009\u00d7\u200980 matrix, 50 slices, voxel size\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4\u2009mm ). Participants were required to keep their bodies and heads still, eyes closed, and not to fall asleep during the entire scanning. To ensure a sufficient data amount of rs\u2010fMRI for reliable personalized functional mapping, each rs\u2010fMRI session included three repeated runs (29\u2009min 33\u2009s in total) for each participant. All patients underwent a post\u2010operative MRI session a week after surgeries. The session included T1w and T2w FLAIR scans to identify lesion locations. \n\n\n###  MRI   data preprocessing \n  \nBoth rs\u2010fMRI and structural data were processed using the pBFS Cloud v1.0.7 (Neural Galaxy Inc., Beijng). The preprocessing pipeline was developed according to our previously described pipelines (Ren et al.,\u00a0 ; Ren, Hubbard, et al.,\u00a0 ; Ren, Xu, et al.,\u00a0 ). The fMRI preprocessing pipeline includes (1) slice timing correction, (2) rigid body correction, (3) linear detrending and bandpass filtering (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz), and (4) regression of nuisance variables, including six motion parameters, white\u2010matter signal, ventricular signal, global signal, and their first temporal derivatives. \n\nT1w images were processed using the FreeSurfer version 6.0.0 software package ( ). The intracranial volume was estimated for each patient based on the brain segmentation. Surface mesh representations of individual cerebral cortices were reconstructed from the T1w images and non\u2010linearly aligned to a common spherical coordinate system. For coregistration, the functional and structural images were affinely aligned using boundary\u2010based registration from the FsFast software package ( ). Subsequently, the preprocessed functional images were registered to the FreeSurfer cortical surface template (fsaverage6). A 6\u2010mm full\u2010width half\u2010maximum (FWHM) surface smoothing kernel was then applied to the fMRI data on the cortical surface. Additionally, the preprocessed functional images were spatially normalized to a volumetric template with a 2\u2010mm spatial resolution (the MNI152 template) using volumetric nonlinear registration facilitated by the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs). Following the normalization step, a 6\u2010mm FWHM smoothing kernel was applied to the registered fMRI data within the brain mask. \n\n\n### Lesion segmentation \n  \nA surgical lesion mask was manually delineated on the native structural image for each participant. Specifically, the post\u2010operative T1w and T2w FLAIR were affinely aligned to pre\u2010operative T1w images using the ANTs. Subsequently, an experienced neurosurgeon manually delineated the lesion boundaries slice by slice using the MRIcron v1.0 software ( ). It is important to note that while the majority of patients exhibited limited perilesional edemas, a subset of patients presented with significant edematous regions. These areas can be considered as transient and reversible \u201clesions,\u201d in addition to the surgical lesion, and have the potential to impact cognitive functions. Consequently, to ensure comprehensive lesion mapping, the perilesional edemas were incorporated into the lesion masks. To ensure accuracy and reliability, the lesion masks were then re\u2010evaluated and confirmed by a senior neuroradiologist and a senior neurosurgeon. \n\n\n### Identifying functional network specifically associated with verbal memory \n  \nThe functional architecture of the cerebral cortex is organized into multiple large\u2010scale, parallel functional networks, each dedicated to specific functions and collaborating with other networks to facilitate our daily activities (Braga & Buckner,\u00a0 ; Gordon et al.,\u00a0 ). To identify a specific functional network associated with verbal memory, we conducted a two\u2010fold analysis. Initially, a group\u2010level functional atlas comprising 7 large\u2010scale canonical functional networks was estimated using data from 1000 healthy participants, as described in previous studies (Yeo et al.,\u00a0 ). To identify which network is most closely associated with verbal memory processing, we generated a meta\u2010analysis association map focused on \u201csemantic memory,\u201d incorporating 123 studies, using NeuroSynth (Yarkoni et al.,\u00a0 ) ( ). The map was thresholded at   p  \u2009<\u2009.01, corrected for false discovery rate (Figure\u00a0 ). By directly comparing the map and the overlap with each network, we found that the default mode network (DMN) displays the largest proportion of activated volume. However, considering the functional heterogeneity within the DMN, previous research has demonstrated the existence of at least two parallel subnetworks within the DMN (Braga & Buckner,\u00a0 ; Gordon et al.,\u00a0 ). To enhance the specificity of our defined network for verbal memory, we further subdivided the DMN into two networks. \n\nSpecifically, we utilized data from the same 1000 subjects from the GSP dataset as employed by Yeo and colleagues (Yeo et al.,\u00a0 ). We applied the K\u2010means clustering strategy to the DMN voxels, using the RSFC profile of each voxel to 1175 cortical ROIs as features (for more details in [Yeo et al.,\u00a0 ]), to divide it into 2 subnetworks. The initial seed of the clustering for one cluster was based on the average RSFC profiles across voxels within the region identified by the Neurosynth map (Figure\u00a0 ), while the initial seed for the other cluster was based on the average RSFC profiles across voxels within the DMN, excluding the Neurosynth map region. Following the clustering procedure, we parcellated the DMN into two subnetworks (Figure\u00a0 ). One network, highly correlated with the RSFC map of the Neurosynth map (  r  \u2009=\u20090.92), was named the verbal memory network (VMN), which is more specifically associated with verbal memory functions (Figure\u00a0 ). The other network, less correlated with the map (  r  \u2009=\u20090.57), was named the fronto\u2010temporal network (FTN), reflecting its anatomical locations. Additionally, we observed evident differences in the functional connectivity between the two subnetworks (Figure\u00a0 ), indicating their functional dissociations. Based on the specific VMN and the 8\u2010network group\u2010level functional atlas, we performed the following personalized parcellation. \n\n\n###  PVMN   mapping \n  \nTopographies of personalized functional networks, particularly higher\u2010order cognitive networks, exhibit significant variability among individuals (Mueller et al.,\u00a0 ). Consequently, it is essential to perform PVMN mapping for precise presurgical planning. To achieve this, we applied a personalized functional network mapping technique adapted from our previous reports (Cui et al.,\u00a0 ; Wang et al.,\u00a0 ). Briefly, to initiate the individualization procedure, we projected the group\u2010level 8\u2010network functional atlas onto each individual's cerebral cortex. Guided by the group\u2010level functional atlas, the functional network boundaries for each patient were refined in an iterative manner. First, for each cortical voxel, we calculated the similarity between its timeseries and averaged timeseries across voxels within each functional network. Second, the voxels were assigned to the network with the largest similarity. Functional network boundaries for each patient thus were refreshed and further guided the next iteration. During this iterative process, spatial distributions of inter\u2010individual variability in resting\u2010state functional connectivity (RSFC) and temporal signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio (tSNR) were taken into account as weighting factors in averaging timeseries (Cui et al.,\u00a0 ; Wang et al.,\u00a0 ). Vertices exhibiting greater inter\u2010individual variability were assigned higher weights to ensure adequate incorporation of individual\u2010specific functional information from these regions. Additionally, vertices with higher tSNR were assigned higher weights to promote iterative stability and mitigate the influence of noise. The iterative procedure continued until reaching the 10th iteration, a predefined number of iterations established empirically based on findings from our previous studies (Wang et al.,\u00a0 ), resulting in a surface\u2010based personalized functional parcellation. Subsequently, we mapped the volumetric PVMN for each patient by utilizing their individual\u2010specific RSFC seeded from the surface\u2010based personalized verbal memory network. RSFC was estimated by calculating the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the average timeseries across the voxels within the network and the timeseries of each brain voxel, and was further normalized using the Fisher's   r  \u2010to\u2010  z   transformation. To ensure reliability and control noise, we applied an RSFC threshold of 0.3 to yield a binarized volumetric PVMN. This mapping technique allowed us to reliably delineate PVMN, as it leveraged our knowledge of organizational principles shared by the population while maximizing the utilization of information inherent in each individual's unique data. \n\n\n### Laterality index of the   PVMN  \n  \nThe laterality index (LI) of the PVMN was calculated following the previous study (Liu et al.,\u00a0 ), using the following equation: where   and   represent the number of vertices within the left\u2010 and right\u2010hemisphere PVMN, respectively. A positive LI indicates a left\u2010lateralized map, while a negative LI indicates a right\u2010lateralized one. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nTo compare the pre\u2010 and post\u2010operative cognitive assessments, we performed paired sample   t  \u2010tests in the AVLT\u2010delayed score, AVLT\u2010immediate score, and WAB\u2010AQ. Based on whether their AVLT\u2010delayed score decreased beyond the RCI, participants were divided into a declined and non\u2010declined group. The Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum test was used to compare the differences in all assessment declines between the groups. The Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank test was conducted to examine the verbal memory decline after surgery in the overlapped and non\u2010overlapped groups. Moreover, we performed Fisher's exact test to examine whether decrease in AVLT\u2010delayed score was associated with hippocampal resection and surgical types. \n\nTo establish an appropriate threshold of the overlap between surgical lesion and verbal memory network indicative of post\u2010operative decline, we employed a data\u2010driven approach to determine the hyper\u2010parameter within the classification framework. Specifically, the degree of the overlap between surgical lesion and verbal memory network was estimated by a lesion volume ratio for each patient. The lesion volume ratio of the verbal memory network by calculating the ratio of post\u2010operative lesion volume of the verbal memory network to the total intracranial volume (TIV) estimated by FreeSurfer. This normalization procedure allowed for comparison across varying brain sizes among patients. Subsequently, we implemented a nested leave\u2010one\u2010out cross\u2010validation (LOOCV) process, known for its robustness in hyper\u2010parameter optimization (Cui et al.,\u00a0 ; Li et al.,\u00a0 ). This nested cross\u2010validation comprises an outer loop and an inner loop. Within each outer loop iteration, one sample was designated as the testing set, while the remaining 27 samples underwent an inner loop procedure, wherein they were divided into a training set (26 samples) and a validation set (1 sample) using another LOOCV process. The hyper\u2010parameter \u201coverlap threshold\u201d was optimized by assessing the classification performance of the inner LOOCV, thereby preventing information leakage from the test sample. This optimization procedure was conducted for both the PVMN and the group\u2010level atlas to ensure fair comparison. \n\nFollowing the determination of the overlap threshold, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the classification task in predicting declines in AVLT\u2010delayed scores. Additionally, we computed Pearson's correlation between AVLT\u2010delayed score declines and the ratios of lesion volume within a functional network or normalized lesion volumes. The normalized lesion volumes were calculated by the ratio of the total lesion volume to the TIV. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Patients, behaviors, and lesions \n  \nThirty\u2010eight patients diagnosed with refractory epilepsy were screened. Four patients were excluded due to the presence of preoperative space\u2010occupying lesions, while six patients were additionally excluded due to failures to complete the postoperative follow\u2010up, resulting into a total of 28 patients in the study (20 temporal and 8 extra\u2010temporal lobe epilepsy; see Table\u00a0 ). The preoperative neuropsychological assessments, including AVLT\u2010delayed, AVLT\u2010immediate, and WAB\u2010AQ, were summarized and presented. The surgical procedures involved resection or RF\u2010TC to target the epileptic foci and yielded focal lesions. The surgeries resulted in a significant decline in AVLT\u2010delayed scores (Figure\u00a0 ; pre\u2010operative\u2009=\u200910.07\u2009\u00b1\u20093.85 points; post\u2010operative score\u2009=\u20096.68\u2009\u00b1\u20094.02 points; paired sample   t  \u2010test,   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22124.26, Bonferroni corrected   p  \u2009<\u2009.001), AVLT\u2010immediate scores (pre\u2010operative\u2009=\u200948.14\u2009\u00b1\u200910.67 points; post\u2010operative score\u2009=\u200940.93\u2009\u00b1\u200912.74 points;   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22122.74, Bonferroni corrected   p  \u2009=\u2009.030), and WAB\u2010AQ scores (pre\u2010operative\u2009=\u200996.11\u2009\u00b1\u20093.09; post\u2010operative score\u2009=\u200992.72\u2009\u00b1\u20095.94;   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22123.10, Bonferroni corrected   p  \u2009=\u2009.014). Here we further focused on AVLT\u2010delayed scores in subsequent analyses. Using the RCI cutoff of 4 points, 14 out of 28 patients (50.0%) exhibited clinically meaningful declines in the delayed verbal memory after surgery. Patients undergoing RF\u2010TC exhibited a reduced likelihood of experiencing verbal memory decline compared to those undergoing resection (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u20097.04,   p  \u2009=\u2009.008). This observation may result from differences in lesion sizes, as lesions resulting from resection procedures were significantly larger than those from RF\u2010TC (resection\u2009=\u200932.5\u2009\u00b1\u200934.1\u2009cm , RF\u2010TC\u2009=\u20095.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4\u2009cm , two\u2010sample   t  \u2010test,   t  \u2009=\u20092.76,   p  \u2009=\u2009.01). Consequently, resection lesions were more likely to overlap with the PVMN, thus potentially leading to verbal memory decline. The surgical lesion overlapping map revealed a spatial distribution of lesions locating not only in the temporal lobe but also in the extra\u2010temporal regions (Figure\u00a0 ). Moreover, patients with verbal memory decline predominantly exhibited lesions in the left temporal area, while those without declines mainly had right\u2010temporal lesions (Figure\u00a0 ), in line with prior studies (Saling,\u00a0 ; Sherman et al.,\u00a0 ). \n  \nBaseline demographic and clinical characteristics. \n      \nPatients show impairments in verbal memory and language following temporal lobe surgeries. The bar graphs illustrate the pre\u2010 and post\u2010operative scores for (A) Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) delayed recall, (B) AVLT immediate recall and (C) WAB\u2010AQ. Each dot line indicates the change trajectory of each patient. Both the verbal memory scores (paired sample   t  \u2010test, AVLT\u2010delayed recall:   p  \u2009<\u2009.001; AVLT\u2010immediate recall:   p  \u2009=\u2009.030) and language scores (WAB\u2010AQ:   p  \u2009=\u2009.014) show significant declines after surgeries. Error bars indicate the standard deviations. pre, pre\u2010operative scores; post, post\u2010operative scores; WAB\u2010AQ, Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient. \n    \nThe surgical lesion overlap map. Each participant's surgical lesion mask was manually delineated and overlaid onto a common brain template. The surgical lesion overlap map is shown at the axial view and thresholded at >0, revealing the distribution of surgical lesions across the whole brain. Areas with brighter colors represent regions where a higher number of patients had lesions, indicating common areas affected by surgery. Surgical lesions concentrated at the temporal lobe but also distributed in the frontal and parietal lobes. \n  \n\n###  PVMNs   show individual differences in network topography and lateralization \n  \nThrough comparing the meta\u2010analysis activation map on verbal memory with group\u2010average canonical functional networks, we identified the network most associated with verbal memory processing is the default mode network (DMN; Figure\u00a0 ), known for its association with higher\u2010order language processing and memory functions (Gordon et al.,\u00a0 ; Wirth et al.,\u00a0 ). Due to substantial individual differences in functional network topographies (Li et al.,\u00a0 ; Mueller et al.,\u00a0 ), personalized verbal memory mapping might be more valuable for presurgical planning than relying on the group\u2010level atlas. To this end, we leveraged individual\u2010specific RSFC to map PVMN. The personalized functional networks demonstrated relatively high consistency in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus, while showing notable inter\u2010individual variability in the anterior temporal lobes (Figure\u00a0 ). Moreover, 75% (21/28) and 25% (7/28) of patients show left\u2010 and right\u2010lateralized personalized functional networks, respectively. These left\u2010lateralized patterns are consistent with our and previous clinical observations, suggesting a higher likelihood of deficits following left temporal lobe resection compared to right temporal lobe resection (Saling,\u00a0 ; Sherman et al.,\u00a0 ). This alignment might be attributed to the larger volume of the verbal memory network in the left hemisphere, making it more susceptible to being resected during left\u2010hemisphere surgeries. \n  \nIndividual differences in topographies of personalized verbal memory networks. The network overlapping map represents the overlap of personalized verbal memory networks (PVMNs) across all participants. Brain areas depicted in warm colors (red and yellow) represent regions frequently included in the PVMNs of multiple patients, while regions in darker or cooler tones indicate less overlap. The map reveals less overlapping in the temporal lobe compared to the frontal and parietal lobes. This finding underscores the significance of personalized presurgical planning to preserve verbal memory before temporal lobe surgeries. \n  \n\n###  PVMNs   can accurately predict the post\u2010operative declines \n  \nTo validate the accuracy of personalized verbal memory mapping, we classified patients into two groups based on whether their surgical lesions overlapped with the PVMN (the overlapped group vs. the non\u2010overlapped group). The overlap threshold was determined through the data\u2010driven procedure (see Methods). Consequently, patients with lesion volume ratios of the verbal memory network exceeding 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , equivalent to 0.63\u2009cm , were classified into the overlapped group (see Figure\u00a0 ). Four representative patients from both groups are shown to illustrate the overlaps between PVMNs and their surgical lesions (Figure\u00a0 ). Notably, all patients in the overlapped group displayed clinically meaningful declines in verbal memory (14/14), demonstrating 100% sensitivity. Their verbal memory exhibited a significant decrease in AVLT\u2010delayed score (Figure\u00a0 ; pre\u2010operative\u2009=\u200911.36\u2009\u00b1\u20093.37; post\u2010operative\u2009=\u20094.79\u2009\u00b1\u20093.62; Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank test,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001). In contrast, none of the patients in the non\u2010overlapped group experienced clinically meaningful declines in verbal memory (14/14), resulting in 100% specificity, and no significant difference was observed before and after surgeries (Figure\u00a0 ; pre\u2010operative\u2009=\u20098.79\u2009\u00b1\u20093.98 points; post\u2010operative\u2009=\u20098.57\u2009\u00b1\u20093.57;   p  \u2009=\u2009.78). For comparison, we replicated the prediction analysis using the group\u2010level atlas, resulting into 85.7% (12/14) of sensitivity, 71.4% (10/14) of specificity, and 78.6% (22/28) of overall accuracy (Figure\u00a0  for misclassified cases, and Figure\u00a0 ). Additionally, we performed the analysis utilizing the side of surgery as a predictor, specifically associating left\u2010hemisphere surgeries with post\u2010operative declines. The resulting sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 57.1% (8/14), 71.4% (10/14), and 64.3% (18/28), respectively (Figure\u00a0 ). These results demonstrate that the personalized functional network mapping technique outperforms both the group\u2010level atlas and side of surgery in predicting postoperative verbal memory declines, highlighting the importance of individualized mapping approaches for guiding resection margin in presurgical planning. \n  \nPersonalized verbal memory networks predict verbal memory declines. Participants were divided into two groups based on whether their personalized verbal memory network overlapped with their surgical lesions. (A) Four representative examples from the overlapped group, PA02, PA17, PA20, and PA21, are shown. The left column displays pre\u2010 (upper panel) and post\u2010operative anatomical images (lower panel), depicting radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF\u2010TC) lesions in the right temporal lobe for PA02 and left temporal lobe for PA17, as well as left temporal lobe resections for PA20 and PA21. The center column illustrates the overlapping personalized verbal memory network, depicted in red, and the right column zooms in to provide a detailed view of the lesions and personalized network. The RF\u2010TC lesions are highlighted by orange arrows. (B) Four representative examples from the non\u2010overlapped group, PA04, PA05, PA06, and PA15, are shown. (C) The bar graph presents the pre\u2010 and post\u2010operative Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT)\u2010delay scores in the overlapped group. All patients marked by red dot lines exhibit consistent and significant declines in verbal memory (  p  \u2009<\u2009.001). (D) The bar graph of the non\u2010overlapped group demonstrates no significant declines in verbal memory (  p  \u2009=\u2009.78). Error bars represent standard deviations. pre, pre\u2010operative scores; post, post\u2010operative scores. \n    \nFalse positive and false negative cases according to the group\u2010level verbal memory network. All six patients who were inaccurately predicted based on the group\u2010level verbal memory network (VMN) are shown. (A) Four patients have been identified as false positives according to the group\u2010level atlas. These patients exhibited lesions that spatially overlapped with the group\u2010level default mode network (DMN) but did not demonstrate subsequent declines in postoperative verbal memory. The corresponding changes in their Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT)\u2010delayed score are detailed for each patient. (B) Two patients are false negative samples, having lesions that did not overlap with the group\u2010level VMN; however, this patient experienced clinically significant postoperative declines in verbal memory. \n  \n\n###  PVMNs   accurately localize extra\u2010temporal regions \n  \nWe further examined eight patients with surgical lesions in extra\u2010temporal regions in detail (Figure\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ), with six patients having lesions in the prefrontal cortex and two in the parietal lobe. Results showed that six out of eight patients demonstrated selective impairments in verbal memory. Specifically, these patients exhibited clinically meaningful declines in AVLT\u2010delayed scores following resections, ranging from 4\u2010 to 12\u2010point declines. However, their WAB\u2010AQ scores, which measure overall language impairment, remained relatively stable, with changes ranging from 0\u2010 to 2.8\u2010point decline. Importantly, we observed evident overlaps between the surgical lesions and the PVMN in the six patients, which aligned with the observed selective impairments in verbal memory (Figure\u00a0 ). In contrast, the patients without verbal memory impairment had a non\u2010overlapping PVMN with the surgical lesion (Figure\u00a0 ). This finding underscores the localization accuracy of our personalized functional mapping in extra\u2010temporal regions, further validating the utility and reliability of our approach in potential applications for precisely identifying critical functional regions for verbal memory. \n  \nPatients with lesions in the extra\u2010temporal areas of the personalized functional network show significant verbal memory declines. Eight patients whose surgical lesion located outside of temporal lobe were included in the study. (A) Six out of eight patients with evident overlapping between surgical lesions and the personalized verbal memory networks show clinical meaningful decline in verbal memory, ranging from 4 to 12 points. Meanwhile, their Western Aphasia Battery\u2010Aphasia Quotient (WAB\u2010AQ) exhibit no clinically important difference, with declines from 0 to 2.8 points. (B) Two patients without overlapping between the surgical lesions and the personalized networks show improvement or no change in verbal memory and language. \n  \n\n### Lesion extent of personalized networks can accurately predict the degree of post\u2010operative declines \n  \nMoreover, we sought to determine whether the personalized network could predict the degree of post\u2010operative functional declines according to the lesioned extent of the network. We found a significant correlation between the lesion volume ratio of the PVMN and the extent of post\u2010operative verbal memory declines (Figure\u00a0 ; Pearson's correlation,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.39,   p  \u2009=\u2009.038), indicating that a larger lesion volume ratio of the PVMN is associated with a greater degree of functional declines. However, no significant correlation was found when using the group\u2010level atlas (Figure\u00a0 ;   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.19,   p  \u2009=\u2009.332). This finding further supports the accuracy of the personalized network mapping and highlights the lesion volume ratio of the personalized network rather than the group\u2010level atlas as a valuable predictive factor for prognostics. \n  \nThe lesioned volume ratio of the verbal memory network is associated with verbal memory declines. The scatter plots display the relationship between the lesioned ratio of (A) the personalized verbal memory map and (B) the group\u2010level atlas with the post\u2010operative declines in Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT)\u2010delay scores. The black dots represent all individuals. The solid line represents the linear regression line that best fits the data. A significant negative correlation (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.39,   p  \u2009=\u2009.038) is observed between the lesioned ratio of the personalized network and the post\u2010operative declines in AVLT\u2010delay scores. However, there is no significant correlation (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.19,   p  \u2009=\u2009.332) between the lesioned ratio of the group\u2010level atlas and the post\u2010operative declines in AVLT\u2010delay scores. These results indicate that a larger volume of lesions within the personalized network, rather than the group\u2010level atlas, is associated with more severe impairments in verbal memory after surgery. \n  \n\n### Control analyses \n  \nTo account for potential confounding factors influencing post\u2010operative verbal memory declines, we conducted several control analyses, including the assessments of (1) overall lesion volume, (2) other personalized networks, and (3) the presence of hippocampal lesions. First, we investigated the relationship between post\u2010operative verbal memory declines and normalized lesion volumes adjusted for intracranial volumes (Figure\u00a0 ). The analysis revealed no significant correlation (Pearson's correlation,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.24,   p  \u2009=\u2009.224), suggesting that the presence of lesions within the verbal memory network, rather than lesion volumes per se, plays a more substantial role in explaining the observed verbal memory declines. Second, we explored whether the other seven personalized networks could also account for the verbal memory declines. However, no significant correlation was observed between the lesion volume ratio of these personalized networks and the extent of verbal memory decline (Figure\u00a0 ; all   p  's\u2009>\u2009.05), indicating the functional specificity of the personalized DMN in representing verbal memory function. Finally, we assessed the impact of hippocampal lesions on verbal memory declines. The analysis revealed that 50.0% (5/10) of patients without hippocampal lesions, and 50.0% (9/18) of patients with hippocampal lesions experienced clinically meaningful post\u2010operative decline in verbal memory, suggestive of a limited influence of hippocampal lesions on verbal memory declines in our samples (Fisher's exact test, two tailed,   p  \u2009=\u20091). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nVerbal memory decline is a major postoperative complication following temporal lobe surgeries (Sidhu et al.,\u00a0 ). While the temporal lobe is widely recognized as a core node for verbal memory, extra\u2010temporal areas, including the orbitofrontal cortex, angular gyrus, as well as anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, also play crucial roles in this cognitive function (Savage et al.,\u00a0 ; Sidhu et al.,\u00a0 ; Sidhu et al.,\u00a0 ). These temporal and extra\u2010temporal areas are together organized into a distributed functional network across the whole brain. In the study, we found the distributed functional network is or at least is a part of the DMN. In line with previous studies, the DMN is activated during the verbal memory task performance (Andreasen et al.,\u00a0 ) and its functional and anatomical impairments are associated with verbal memory declines in aging, stroke, and mild cognitive impairment (Huo et al.,\u00a0 ; Park et al.,\u00a0 ; Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ). The distributed functional network in verbal memory processing is further supported by the selective impairments of verbal memory in six cases whose surgical lesions were located outside of the temporal lobe but in the verbal memory network. \n\nHigher\u2010order association networks, such as the language, memory, and executive control networks, show substantial inter\u2010individual functional variability in healthy populations (Mueller et al.,\u00a0 ). The findings of the study reveal a pronounced degree of variability in the verbal memory network, particularly in the temporal lobe, with minimal overlapping probability observed across different patients. This noteworthy variability highlights the critical importance of employing personalized functional margin mapping techniques to better understand and accommodate individual differences. In addition, the personalized functional organization of the human brain is not solely explained by anatomical substrates (Li et al.,\u00a0 ; Nenning et al.,\u00a0 ). Therefore, surgical guidelines based only on anatomical landmarks may not be sufficient to prevent postoperative functional declines. In contrast, our personalized functional mapping technique demonstrates high predictive accuracy, and the lesioned ratios show a modest correlation with post\u2010operative declines in verbal memory. These results indicate that our personalized mapping approach effectively captures the functional margins for each individual and accounts for individual differences in a reliable and precise manner. \n\nIntraoperative functional mapping of eloquent cortices through direct electrical stimulation has become a standard clinical practice for identifying motor and language areas (Chang et al.,\u00a0 ; Ojemann et al.,\u00a0 ; Usui et al.,\u00a0 ). However, mapping memory\u2010related areas poses challenges due to their less clearly locatable nature. Our proposed personalized verbal memory mapping represents a promising approach for evaluating the potential impact of different resection boundaries on verbal memory function, thereby enhancing precision in presurgical planning. Moreover, our methods could be naturally generalized to other patients with epilepsy and brain tumors whose lesions involve verbal memory networks, as our method focuses on functional network rather than specific diseases. The versatility of our method also allows for its application in studying various other functional networks, including language, attention, and executive control networks. As a result, this method holds significant potential for broader applicability in presurgical planning and provides neurosurgeons with valuable tools to make well\u2010informed decisions, minimize surgical risks, and ultimately improve surgical outcomes. \n\nThe current study has several limitations that warrant consideration. First, although we proposed a distributed functional network playing a crucial role in verbal memory processing and achieved a high predictive accuracy, we only included eight cases with extra\u2010temporal lesions, which may limit the generalizability of the claim that extra\u2010temporal areas contribute to verbal memory. Moreover, the relatively high observed prevalence of functional impairments among the subgroup (6/8) may partially resulting from a sampling bias that favored the inclusion of patients with substantial lesion sizes. This bias may have contributed to an increased likelihood of lesion overlap with the functional network. Thus, further validating the frontal and parietal regions of the verbal memory network would be valuable in a larger cohort with more heterogeneous lesion locations. Second, the present study collected post\u2010operative data within 1\u20132\u2009weeks after surgery, with the absence of long\u2010term (>3\u2009months) data, as seen in previous clinical studies. The choice of follow\u2010up timepoint aligns with our primary aim, which is to validate the accuracy of personalized functional mapping using surgical lesions rather than to identify predictors for post\u2010operative prognostics, particularly in cases of functional impairments that are difficult to compensate for. Our primary aim prioritizes the immediate impact of surgical lesions and intentionally minimizes the impact of post\u2010operative functional reorganization and compensatory processes. These processes often undergo rapid development within the initial 6\u2009months post\u2010surgery, as well documented in studies related to post\u2010stroke functional rehabilitation (Boes et al.,\u00a0 ; Elger et al.,\u00a0 ). However, we acknowledge the significant value of long\u2010term follow\u2010up data, which can substantially enrich our understanding of functional reorganization processes. Such long\u2010term data will be particularly important for distinguishing brain areas at different risk degrees and further enhancing surgical planning, which are critical clinical considerations for post\u2010operative quality of life. Future research in this direction holds promise for advancing our insights into post\u2010operative outcomes and functional recovery. Third, the assessment of verbal memory relied solely on the AVLT, which primarily measures verbal item memory. Another commonly used assessment in the field is verbal associative memory (Busch et al.,\u00a0 ; Kim et al.,\u00a0 ), which also predominantly activates the left hemisphere. However, these two tasks may recruit different neural substrates (Eichenbaum et al.,\u00a0 ). For instance, the hippocampus appears to be more engaged during associative memory tasks (Binder,\u00a0 ; Kim et al.,\u00a0 ). This could potentially explain the lack of impairment in verbal item memory due to hippocampal damage. \n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nHere, we mapped a PVMN for each patient before surgery. The accuracy of the personalized network mapping was validated through neurosurgeries, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity and outperforming the group\u2010level atlas. Moreover, our findings showed that extent of lesion involvement within the personalized network serves as an accurate predictor for post\u2010operative declines in verbal memory. Overall, the delineation of a PVMN holds promise as a valuable tool in presurgical planning and prognostic prediction, contributing to the preservation of critical functional abilities. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT \n  \nH.
