We performed this meta-analysis to identify the likely cause of neurodevelopmental delay in CHD patients. We carried out a literature search without language restriction in December 2013, retrieving records from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and the World Health Organization trials center, to identify studies applying functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evaluation of brain function before surgery and, in some cases, after surgery (both immediate term and short term postoperatively). The preoperative and postoperative fMRI results were extracted, and meta-analysis was performed using Revman 5.1.1 and STATA 11.0, according to the guidelines from the Cochrane review and MOOSE groups. The electronic search yielded 937 citations. Full text was retrieved for 15 articles and eight articles (nine studies) were eligible for inclusion: six studies (n\u2009=\u2009312 cases) with fMRI analysis before surgery and three (n\u2009=\u200936 cases) with complete perioperative fMRI analysis. The overall average diffusivity of CHD cases was significantly higher than that of controls, with a summarized standard (std) mean difference of 1.39 (95% CI, 0.70-2.08), and the fractional anisotropy was lower in CHD cases, with a summarized mean difference of -1.43 (95% CI, -1.95 to -0.91). N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/choline (Cho) for the whole brain was significantly lower in CHD cases compared with healthy ones, while lactate/Cho was significantly higher in CHD cases. Immediate term postoperatively, significant changes in NAA/creatine and NAA/Cho, relative to preoperative values, were found. However, the difference did not persist at the short-term follow-up. This meta-analysis suggests that the delay in neurological development in newborns with CHD is due mainly to prenatal injury, and cardiac surgery might lead to mild brain injuries postoperatively, but fMRI shows recovery within a short period.
