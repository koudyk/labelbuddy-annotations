At the high end are formal psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, and at the low-end are individuals who experience occasional psychotic symptoms, but are otherwise healthy (non-clinical psychosis, NCP). Schizophrenia has been shown to be marked by altered patterns of connectivity between brain regions, but it is not known if such dysconnectivity exists in NCP. In the current study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare resting-state functional connectivity in NCP individuals (n\u00a0=\u00a025) and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a027) for four brain networks of interest (fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular, default mode, and cerebellar networks). NCP individuals showed reduced connectivity compared to controls between regions of the default mode network and frontal regions, and between regions in all of the networks and the thalamus. NCP individuals showed greater connectivity compared to controls within regions of frontal control networks. Further, positive symptom scores in NCP individuals were positively correlated with connectivity between the cingulo-opercular network and the visual cortex, and were negatively correlated with connectivity between the cerebellar network and the posterior parietal cortex and dorsal premotor cortex. Connectivity was not correlated with positive symptom scores in controls. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that a spectrum of abnormal connectivity underlies the psychosis continuum, and that individuals with sub-clinical psychotic experiences represent a key population for understanding pathogenic processes.           BODY            1.\u2003Introduction    The suggestion that psychosis occurs along a continuum is becoming more and more accepted (  ). At one end of this spectrum are individuals who have rare psychotic-like experiences (i.e., suspiciousness, thought insertion/broadcasting, ideas of reference, grandiosity, perceptual abnormalities) in the absence of any formal psychotic illness (non-clinical psychosis;  ). At the opposite end are the formal psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Representing 5\u20138% of the general populations, individuals endorsing non-clinical psychosis (NCP) are more likely to develop comorbid disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression), and are at a substantially heightened risk for psychotic disorders later in life (  ), suggesting a critical need to understand vulnerability in this group. An advantage of studying this group is the lack of confounding factors such as chronic medication seen in formal psychosis. However, it is unclear what neurological characteristics are present in individuals with NCP. Identifying whether this group displays putative biomarkers of formal psychosis (e.g., structural/functional abnormalities) is important for advancing our understanding of this important high risk group, and possibly to furthering our understanding of the etiology of psychosis.    A relatively large number of studies have investigated disruptions in brain connectivity in psychosis. This is due in part to evidence suggesting that schizophrenia is associated with disruptions in connectivity between prefrontal and temporal cortices (  ). A recent review of connectivity studies across the psychosis spectrum presents an inconsistent picture in terms of hypo- and hyper-connectivity, but suggests a trend towards decreased cortical connectivity with the frontal lobes (  ). Resting state functional connectivity (i.e., correlations in activation of different regions assessed in a scan during rest) provides a means to assess altered connectivity between psychotic and healthy groups without the need to rely on any cognitive task. Altered resting-state connectivity with the frontal lobes has been shown across the psychosis spectrum, from individuals with a genetic risk (  ), clinical high risk or prodromal state (  ), first-episode schizophrenia (  ), to individuals with chronic schizophrenia (  ).    A recent study has suggested that altered connectivity between the frontal lobes and the cerebellum may be critical in understanding psychosis (  ). Using machine learning algorithms to discriminate between schizophrenia patients and controls based on resting state data, these authors found the highest discriminative power for connectivity between frontal and cerebellar regions. Connectivity strength between the frontal cortex and the cerebellum in schizophrenia has also been shown to be positively correlated with cognitive scores (i.e., greater connectivity\u00a0=\u00a0better performance) and negatively correlated with symptoms (i.e., weaker connectivity\u00a0=\u00a0worse symptoms) (  ). Therefore, it is important to investigate whether NCP individuals show similar disruptions in frontal\u2013cerebellar connectivity.    In addition to frontal lobe dysconnection, there has been a good deal of interest in investigating altered connectivity with the default mode network. Although several related subsystems have been proposed, most conceptions suggest that the default mode network consists of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and temporo-parietal cortex. It has been shown to be anti-correlated with frontal-lobe driven control networks (  ), and is thought to be involved in the processing of internal cognition and states, such as memory, emotional states, and self-referential thought (  ). Alterations in default mode network connectivity in schizophrenia may underlie trouble with disconnecting from attention to internal states (  ). However, findings of altered connectivity in psychosis with the default mode network are much more mixed than findings concerning the frontal lobes. While most studies have found decreased default mode network connectivity in psychosis (  ) others have found increased connectivity (  ), or no differences between patients and controls (  ). As anti-psychotic medications are thought to impact resting-state connectivity (  ), the NCP group represents a suitable population for assessing resting-state connectivity disruptions due to psychotic symptoms.    While no broad, systematic assessments of resting-state connectivity in NCP individuals have been published to date, there have been a handful of more focused assessments of connectivity of psychotic-like experiences. In non-psychotic individuals experiencing auditory hallucinations, altered connectivity with the superior temporal cortex (involved in auditory processing) and regions of the default mode network has been observed (  ). Relatedly, Brent and colleagues assessed task-related activation and functional connectivity of the default mode network during a social rejection paradigm in healthy individuals selected from the general population, with no pre-screening for elevated psychotic-like experiences as was done in the current study (  ). They found that delusional thinking was negatively correlated with connectivity between two default mode network regions (lateral temporal cortex and vmPFC), yet positively correlated with connectivity between other default mode network regions (lateral temporal cortex and dorsal medial PFC, and lateral temporal cortex and inferior temporal cortex). Thus, even in healthy controls with no psychotic experiences, the default mode network appears to underlie delusional-type thinking. This pattern of results fits with findings of hypo- and hyper-connectivity with the default mode network in psychotic disorders, discussed above. Our goal was to provide a broader investigation of the networks that are affected in NCP compared to healthy controls.    In the current study, we assessed resting-state connectivity in two frontal lobe cognitive control networks as well as the default mode network and the cerebellum. Previous work has identified two resting-state cognitive control networks, the frontoparietal control network consisting of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and the cingulo-opercular network consisting of the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC), the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and the anterior insula (  ). These two networks are thought to have differential contributions to cognitive control, with the fronto-parietal network exerting transient control and the cingulo-opercular network exerting sustained control. While there is an abundance of data to suggest disrupted fronto-parietal connectivity in psychosis (for a review see  ), to date only one study has examined disruption to cingulo-opercular connectivity (  ). Given the degree of disruption in cognitive control observed in schizophrenia (  ) we were interested in whether control networks were disrupted in a population who share a psychosis diathesis, but not the severe symptoms, cognitive deficits, or 3rd variable confounds (  ). We further predicted that NCP individuals would show disrupted connectivity between frontal regions and regions of the default mode and cerebellar networks. Further, we examined whether severity of psychotic-like experiences in NCP individuals was correlated with connectivity of these networks.      2.\u2003Method     2.1. Participants    All participants were recruited through the Adolescent Development and Preventive Treatment (ADAPT) program at the University of Colorado Boulder, and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved all procedures. To identify participants for NCP group, the undergraduate research pool (n\u00a0=\u00a01285) were screened using the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE) (  ) positive symptom inventory. The option to participate in the study was made available to those scoring in the top 15th percentile on the CAPE positive domain (\u2265 a score of 15 on the CAPE frequency scale). In addition, the study was not made available to those reporting contraindication for imaging during the screening (e.g., metal in the mouth/body, pregnancy/lactation). The research pool is a volunteer research database in which undergraduate students taking an introduction to psychology course participate in research studies for course credit. Several studies recruit from this subject pool. Therefore, in order to limit potential sampling bias (i.e., individuals knowingly selecting studies for which they are most suited or interested in), available studies are listed as numbers without descriptions. Upon arrival to ADAPT, study details were provided and written informed consent was obtained. From the possible 81 invited, a total of 25 randomly selected to participate in this study and upon arrival to ADAPT, no one declined to participate after learning the details of the study. However, data from 2 participants were excluded due to incidental radiological findings.    Healthy control participants (n\u00a0=\u00a027) were recruited through flyers and newspaper announcements (advertised as a study of neuroimaging and healthy development for volunteers with no family history of psychosis and no psychiatric symptoms) and selected on the basis of demographic characteristics comparable to the NCP group in age, sex, and parental educational level (a proxy for social class). To maximize the potential to recruit a normative sample (and not an extreme low NCP group, a limitation acknowledged in previous studies) (  ), screening with the CAPE positive domain was not an inclusion/exclusion criteria for the healthy control group.      2.2. Clinical measures    The CAPE is self-report questionnaire that measures the distress from psychotic-like experiences on a four-item Likert scale including \u201cnot distressed\u201d, \u201ca bit distressed\u201d, \u201cquite distressed\u201d, and \u201cvery distressed\u201d. The CAPE is one of the most widely used, reliable, and well validated instruments for examining NCP (  ). The B module of Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID) (  ) was administered to participants in both groups to ensure that participants with elevated psychosis would not be included, as this could potentially confound results (no participants were excluded based on this criterion). Previous studies show that the SCID yields valid and reliable diagnosis for a wide age range including adolescents and young adults (  ). Advanced psychology doctoral students and clinical psychologists conducted the SCID interviews and reliability exceeded   \u03ba   .\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.80.      2.3. fMRI scanning protocol    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was acquired on each subject using a Siemens 3-Tesla Magnetom TIM Trio MRI scanner (Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) with a 12-channel head coil. Structural images were acquired with a T1-weighted 3D magnetization prepared rapid gradient multi-echo sequence (MPRAGE; sagittal plane; repetition time [TR]\u00a0=\u00a02530\u00a0ms; echo times [TE]\u00a0=\u00a01.64\u00a0ms, 3.5\u00a0ms, 5.36\u00a0ms, 7.22\u00a0ms, 9.08\u00a0ms; GRAPPA parallel imaging factor of 2; 1\u00a0mm3isomorphic voxels, 192 interleaved slices; FOV\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0mm; flip angle\u00a0=\u00a07\u00b0; time\u00a0=\u00a06:03\u00a0min), and functional resting state blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) images were acquired with a T2*-weighted echo-planar functional protocol (number of volumes\u00a0=\u00a0165; TR\u00a0=\u00a02000\u00a0ms; TE\u00a0=\u00a029\u00a0ms; matrix size\u00a0=\u00a064\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064\u00a0\u00d7\u00a033; FA\u00a0=\u00a075\u00b0; 3.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.5\u00a0mm voxels; 33 slices; FOV\u00a0=\u00a0240\u00a0mm; time\u00a0=\u00a05:34). During the resting state scan, participants were instructed to relax and close their eyes. A turbo spin echo proton density (PD)/T2-weighted acquisition (TSE; axial oblique aligned with anterior commissure-posterior commissure line (AC\u2013PC line); TR\u00a0=\u00a03720\u00a0ms; TE\u00a0=\u00a089\u00a0ms; GRAPPA parallel imaging factor of 2; FOV\u00a0=\u00a0240\u00a0mm; flip angle: 120\u00b0; .9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0.9\u00a0mm voxels; 77 interleaved 1.5\u00a0mm slices; time\u00a0=\u00a05:14\u00a0min) was acquired to check for incidental pathology. The resting state scan was kept relatively short in order to minimize anxiety and the possibility of within-scan movement, and this duration has been shown to yield equivalent power as longer scans (  ). The entire imaging protocol, including additional structural scans, was about 45\u00a0min.      2.4. fMRI data analysis    Data were preprocessed in FSL (v. 5;  ) which involved motion correction, brain extraction, high-pass filtering (100\u00a0s) and spatial smoothing (6\u00a0mm FWHM). Functional images were aligned to the MNI 2-mm brain template with a two-step procedure. First, the resting state scan was aligned to the high-resolution MPRAGE using a linear boundary-based registration (BBR) method, which relies on white matter boundaries (  ). Second, the MPRAGE was nonlinearly aligned to the template (  ), and the two registrations were then combined in order to align the function resting state scan to the template.    Recent papers have demonstrated the importance of properly correcting for motion by not only regressing out motion parameters, but also regressing out or eliminating specific frames with motion outliers (  ). To accomplish this, we used the Artifact Rejection Toolbox (ART;  ) to create confound regressors for motion parameters (3 translation and 3 rotation parameters), and additional confound regressors for specific image frames with outliers based on brain activation and head movement. In order to identify outliers in brain activation, the mean global brain activity (i.e., the mean signal across all voxels) was calculated as a function of time, and was then Z-normalized. Outliers were defined as any frames where the global mean signal exceeded 3 SD. Similarly, frame-wise measures of motion (composite measure of total motion across translation and rotation) were used to identify any motion outliers (i.e., motion spikes). Motion outliers were defined as any frame where the motion exceeded 1\u00a0mm. From the motion translation parameters we also calculated mean displacement, and used this measure as well as the number of motion and mean signal outliers in order to compare the degree of head movement between the groups (reported below in Results: Descriptive Statistics).    Functional connectivity was performed in the   conn   toolbox v. 1.3o (  ). Further preprocessing included a band-pass filter (0.008 to 0.09\u00a0Hz), detrending, and despiking. Seed regions-of-interest (ROI's) were defined by coordinates reported by Dosenbach and colleagues (  ). ROI coordinates are shown in  . ROIs were selected to comprise 1) the default mode network [posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and ventral medial prefrontal cortex vmPFC)], 2) the fronto-parietal network [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL)], 3) the cingulo-opercular network [anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC), anterior insula (AI), and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex(dACC)], and 4) the cerebellar network (lateral and inferior cerebellum, roughly corresponding to Crus I/II and Lobule VI). These regions were similar to those used by  . ROI masks were created by defining a 5\u00a0mm radius sphere at each coordinate. The mean time-series from each ROI was used as a predictor regressor. Anatomical images were segmented into gray matter, white matter, and CSF with SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK;  ) in order to create masks for signal extraction. The Conn toolbox uses principal component analysis (PCA) to extract 5 temporal components from the segmented CSF and white matter which were entered as confound regressors in the subject-level GLM. This approach corrects for confounds of motion and physiological noise without regressing out global signal, which has been shown to introduce spurious anticorrelations (  ). As mentioned above, the GLM also included confound regressors for subject motion (6 regressors) and frame-wise outliers (one regressor per outlier) identified in the ART toolbox. At the group-level, age and gender were included as confound regressors.    We conducted two types of between group analyses as well as between- and within-group correlation analyses with positive symptoms. For each of these analyses, the   conn   toolbox used a GLM approach with connectivity measures calculated as bivariate correlations. This yields group-level \u03b2's that are Fisher-transformed correlation coefficient values (i.e., atanh(   r   )). All comparisons were defined as combinations of within- and between-subjects   T   -contrasts. For the between group analyses we performed an ROI-to-ROI analysis to examine connectivity within and between the networks of interest, and a network to rest-of-brain connectivity analysis (i.e., \u2018Seed-to-voxel\u2019). The former involved constructing a 16\u00a0\u00d7\u00a016 connectivity matrix that included all of the ROIs; essentially, the   conn   toolbox uses within-subjects contrasts to model the connectivity between each pair of ROIs. The results were corrected to a false-discovery rate (FDR) of   p   \u00a0<\u00a0.05, corrected for the number of seeds in the analysis.    Both the \u2018Seed-to-voxel\u2019 analysis and the correlations with positive symptoms involved assessing the connectivity between each network and every other voxel in the brain in four separate analyses that averaged the connectivity values of each of the ROI's within a given network (e.g., a within-subjects contrast of [.25 .25 .25 .25] was defined for the 4 ROI's in the cerebellar network). For the correlation analyses, we assessed the correlation of the group-level \u03b2's for each network and the positive symptom scores. We compared these correlations between groups as an interaction of group and positive symptom correlation with network connectivity (i.e., a between-subjects contrast of [0 0 1\u20131] was defined for the factors of control group mean, NCP group mean, control symptom scores, and NCP symptom scores), and further assessed the direction and strength of the correlations within each group. Data in tables and statistical maps were first corrected at the voxel-level to   p   uncorr\u00a0<\u00a0.001 and then corrected at the cluster-level to a false-discovery rate (FDR) of   p   \u00a0<\u00a0.01 (  ); this adjusted for running separate analyses for each of the four networks. Figures of statistical maps were created using Caret software version 5.65 (  ;  ) on the Conte69 atlas (  ) and the Colin cerebellum atlas (  ).       3.\u2003Results     3.1. Descriptive statistics    There were no differences between controls and NCP participants with respect to age (   t   (48)\u00a0=\u00a01.0,   n.s.   ; controls:   M   \u00a0=\u00a018.8,   SD   \u00a0=\u00a01.6; NCP:   M   \u00a0=\u00a018.5,   SD   \u00a0=\u00a00.5), gender makeup (   \u03c7   2\u00a0=\u00a00.023,   n.s.   ; controls: 11 males; NCP: 9 males), or parental education (   t   (46)\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.31,   n.s.   ; controls:   M   \u00a0=\u00a015.4,   SD   \u00a0=\u00a02.9; NCP:   M   \u00a0=\u00a015.6,   SD   \u00a0=\u00a02.0). Reflective of the sampling strategy, the NCP group showed higher CAPE distress scores than controls for positive symptoms (   t   (48)\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a03.8,   p   \u00a0<\u00a0.001; controls:   M   \u00a0=\u00a05.5,   SD   \u00a0=\u00a05.5; NCP:   M   \u00a0=\u00a012.4,   SD   \u00a0=\u00a07.5). For the NCP group, examples of the most endorsed items rated as \u201coften or nearly always\u201d include: \u201cDo you ever feel as if some people are not what they seem to be\u201d (52%); \u201cDo you ever feel as if you are destined to be someone very important\u201d (44%); \u201cDo you ever feel that you are a very special or unusual person?\u201d (44%); \u201cDo you ever feel as if electrical devices such as computers can influence the way you think?\u201d(20%); \u201cDo you ever feel as if you are destined to be someone very important?\u201d (35%); \u201cDo you ever think that people can communicate telepathically?\u201d (12%); \u201cDo you ever feel that people look at you oddly because of your appearance\u201d (12%); \u201cDo you ever feel as if you are under the control of some force or power other than yourself\u201d (12%); and \u201cHave your thoughts ever been so vivid that you were worried other people would hear them?\u201d (8%).    Between group studies of resting state connectivity can be susceptible to spurious findings if the groups differ in their amount of head motion (  ). Therefore, we calculated the mean displacement for each subject (calculated over x, y, and z translation parameters), as well as the number of motion and mean signal outliers. The two groups did not differ in terms of either their mean displacement (   t   (48)\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.14,   n.s.   ; controls:   M   \u00a0=\u00a00.27\u00a0mm; NCP:   M   \u00a0=\u00a00.28\u00a0mm) or the number of outliers (   t   (48)\u00a0=\u00a00.03,   n.s.   ; controls:   M   \u00a0=\u00a05.0; NCP:   M   \u00a0=\u00a05.0).      3.2. Between group analysis    Results from the between group ROI-to-ROI analysis are shown in  . From the right IPL, NCP individuals showed stronger connectivity compared to controls with the right DLPFC (   t   (46)\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a03.0,   p   \u00a0<\u00a0.05), left aPFC (   t   (46)\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a03.3,   p   \u00a0<\u00a0.05), and right aPFC (   t   (46)\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.7,   p   \u00a0<\u00a0.05). From the left aPFC, NCP individuals showed stronger connectivity compared to controls with the right AI (   t   (46)\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.8,   p   \u00a0<\u00a0.05) and right IPL (   t   (46)\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a03.3,   p   \u00a0<\u00a0.05), and weaker connectivity compared to controls with the vmPFC (   t   (46)\u00a0=\u00a02.9,   p   \u00a0<\u00a0.05). Finally, NCP individuals showed weaker connectivity compared to controls between the dACC and the left and right PCC (   t   (46)\u00a0=\u00a04.2,   p   \u00a0<\u00a0.05 and   t   (46)\u00a0=\u00a03.6,   p   \u00a0<\u00a0.05, respectively). To summarize these findings, controls showed stronger connectivity between control network regions and regions of the default mode network, while NCP individuals showed stronger connectivity within control network regions.    We then examined connectivity between the four networks of interest (i.e., the average connectivity of constituent ROI's) and the rest of the brain, as shown in  . Controls showed stronger connectivity compared to NCP individuals between the fronto-parietal network ROI's and the thalamus, pallidum, and lingual gyrus (see  ). Conversely, NCP individuals showed stronger connectivity compared to controls between the fronto-parietal network ROI's and the right aPFC and right IPL. This supports the results of the ROI-to-ROI analysis which found that NCP individuals (vs. controls) showed greater connectivity than controls between control regions. Further, controls showed stronger connectivity compared to NCP individuals between the cingulo-opercular network and the thalamus, basal ganglia, bilateral hippocampus, cerebellar Lobules IV/V, cerebellar vermis, right lateral occipital cortex, and right visual cortex (cuneus and lingual gyrus) (see  ); between the default mode network ROI's and the ventral premotor cortex, thalamus, lingual/fusiform gyrus, and the supplementary motor area/dACC (see  ); and between the cerebellar network ROI's and the dACC, thalamus, insula, pons, and other cerebellar lobules (see  ).      3.3. NCP symptom correlations    We then examined the association between positive symptom scores (increasing scores associated with worse symptomatology) with connectivity strength between each of the four networks and the rest of the brain. This involved running separate voxel-wise analyses for each of the four networks (connectivity was averaged across the constituent ROI's). We examined between group differences in symptom-connectivity correlations, and then separate correlation analyses for each group. The between group analysis is essentially a test for a difference in slope between the groups. As shown in  A and  , there were significant effects for the cerebellar network and the cingulo-opercular network. Controls showed a more positive slope than NCP individuals for the correlation between positive symptom scores and connectivity between the cerebellar network and the right dorsal premotor cortex and between the cingulo-opercular network and the left and right visual cortex. NCP individuals showed a more positive slope than controls for the correlation between positive symptoms and connectivity between the cerebellar network and the right anterior insula. Positive symptom scores in controls did not correlate with connectivity strength of any of the four networks. As shown in  B and  , NCP individuals showed a positive correlation between positive symptom scores and connectivity between the cingulo-opercular network and the left and right visual cortex. This suggests that NCP individuals who had worse symptoms showed greater connectivity between regions of the cingulo-opercular network and the visual cortices. As shown in  B and  , symptom scores in NCP individuals were negatively correlated with connectivity between the cerebellar network regions and the right IPL and left and right dorsal premotor cortex; suggesting that NCP individuals who had less severe symptoms showed greater connectivity between these regions.       4.\u2003Discussion    In the current study, we examined resting state connectivity of the fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular, default mode, and cerebellar networks in individuals with non-clinical psychosis and age-matched healthy controls. Further, we examined correlations between resting-state connectivity and psychosis-like symptoms within and between NCP and control participants. Disrupted connectivity was observed in NCP individuals between ROI's from all four networks. Psychosis-like symptoms in NCP individuals were associated with disrupted connectivity with regions of the cingulo-opercular network and the cerebellar network.    Disruptions in frontal lobe connectivity have long characterized psychosis (  ). In line with this account, we found disrupted connectivity with regions of the fronto-parietal network and the cingulo-opercular network. Examining connections within and between these networks, we found that NCP individuals showed   greater   connectivity compared to controls between the IPL and aPFC. This is opposite to  who found   reduced   connectivity between the IPL and the cingulo-opercular network for schizophrenia patients and their unaffected siblings compared to controls and their siblings. However, in line with Repovs and colleagues, we did find   reduced   connectivity for NCP individuals compared to controls between cingulo-opercular regions (aPFC and dACC) and default mode regions, and between the dACC and cerebellar regions. As frontal regions are typically anti-correlated with default mode regions (  ), reductions in the connectivity between these regions may reflect a pathological abnormality in NCP individuals (  ).    Disruptions in IPL connectivity appeared across the ROI-to-ROI analysis, the seed to whole-brain analysis, as well as the positive symptom score correlation. IPL connectivity with several frontal control regions were observed to be stronger in NCP individuals compared to controls, and connectivity between the IPL and the cerebellum was negatively correlated with positive symptoms in NCP individuals, though this finding did not show a group difference. The right parietal cortex, and the IPL in particular, has strong connections with the prefrontal cortex via a major white matter tract, the superior longitudinal fasciculus (  ), underlying the importance of the IPL in supporting cognitive control. The IPL, like the prefrontal cortex, is a major brain region for sensory integration (  ), which has long been known to be disrupted in psychosis (  ). Furthermore, the IPL appears to be strongly affected in psychosis, with deficits in volume, structural connectivity, and functional activation (see  for a review). Without cognitive assessments, however, it is unclear whether the hyper-connectivity observed for NCP individuals represents a pathologically overactive system. Future studies should compare cognitive performance in NCP individuals and controls.    To our knowledge, the only other study to examine connectivity with the cingulo-opercular network in the psychosis spectrum was  . They found reduced connectivity across schizophrenia patients and their siblings between the cingulo-opercular network and the fronto-parietal network, and well as between the cingulo-opercular network and cerebellar regions. We replicated the finding of reduced connectivity between the cingulo-opercular network and cerebellum for NCP individuals, and also found reductions between the cingulo-opercular network and the thalamus, basal ganglia, bilateral hippocampus, and visual areas. Repovs and colleagues included the thalamus as part of the cingulo-opercular network, however, they found no differences in connectivity between the thalamus and other areas of the cingulo-opercular network. Similar to the fronto-parietal network, we also found increased connectivity between the cingulo-opercular network and the right parietal cortex. The dACC and aPFC are both thought to play important roles in attention (  ), so altered connectivity between the subregions of the cingulo-opercular network and the right parietal cortex is an important finding and establishes a target for future research.    When investigating altered default mode network connectivity, most studies have examined differences in within-network connectivity between patients and controls, or anti-correlations between the default mode network and task-positive networks. While we found no group differences for connectivity between default mode network regions, we found reduced connectivity for NCP individuals between the default mode and cingulo-opercular networks, and between the default mode network and premotor cortex, thalamus/basal ganglia, and lingual gyrus. The former finding is in line with  who found reduced anti-correlations in ultra-high risk individuals between the PCC and task-related areas including the DLPFC, as well as with  , who reported reduced connectivity between the default mode and cingulo-opercular networks for schizophrenia patients and their unaffected siblings. Similar findings have been obtained by others (  ).    A number of studies have examined how functional connectivity measures correlate with symptomatology in schizophrenia. The majority of these findings have demonstrated that positive symptoms are associated with disrupted connectivity with the default mode network.  found that increased positive symptoms were associated with decreased connectivity with the PCC and temporal cortex. Similarly,  found that connectivity of the default mode network was negatively correlated with positive symptoms. In non-psychotic individuals, auditory hallucinations have been associated with altered connectivity between the default mode network and auditory regions (  ). In healthy controls, delusional-type thinking has been negatively associated with connectivity within the default mode network (  ).    While we found no association between default mode network connectivity and positive symptoms, we did find that positive symptoms in NCP individuals were associated with increased connectivity between the cingulo-opercular network and visual cortex, and with decreased connectivity between the cerebellar network and IPL and dorsal premotor cortex. The group comparison of positive symptom correlations demonstrated that, with the exception of connectivity between the cerebellar regions and the IPL, these correlations were only present in NCP individuals and not in controls. The lack of any significant correlation between connectivity and symptoms in controls differs with the findings of  . Brent and colleagues examined a similar healthy control sample to our control subjects, and found that delusional-like thinking was correlated with decreased connectivity with the default mode network. However, Brent and colleagues focused on the lateral temporal cortex due to its involvement in their social reflection task of interest, while we did not include this region as a default mode network ROI.    While the CAPE assessed whether NCP individuals experienced perceptual abnormalities, such as seeing unusual or non-existent shadows, that might relate to altered connectivity with the visual cortex, we did not employ detailed questionnaires about perceptual hallucinations. Future research should examine the link between various perceptual abnormalities (e.g., visual vs. auditory) in order to understand how such experiences might be driven by altered connectivity with sensory cortices. This may help to explain the different findings of the current study and studies of NCP individuals selected for the presence of auditory hallucinations (  ). The negative correlation between positive symptoms and cerebellar connectivity is in line with the influential \u2018cognitive dysmetria\u2019 hypothesis which states that disruptions of cerebellar functioning may drive many of the symptoms of schizophrenia (  ). This finding demonstrates that altered connectivity between control networks and the cerebellum may be an important biomarker, even at the low end of the psychosis spectrum.    It is striking that despite being from the general population and not exhibiting clinically significant social dysfunction as college students, NCP individuals showed widespread altered connectivity relative to controls. While most of these differences were reductions of connectivity in NCP individuals and were in line with previous studies of schizophrenia, several frontal control regions showed increased connectivity with right parietal lobule. Given the importance of fronto-parietal connections in cognitive control, future studies should investigate the functioning of cognitive control in individuals with non-clinical psychosis. Even with sub-clinical symptom levels, NCP individuals showed correlations between functional connectivity and distress levels from positive symptoms, while these correlations were not present in healthy controls. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that individuals with sub-clinical psychotic experiences represent a key population for studying the psychosis spectrum, without confounding factors such as chronic medication effects and clinically significant cognitive deficits.    It should be noted that many previous functional connectivity studies of the psychosis spectrum have regressed out the global mean signal (e.g.,  ). Including the global mean signal as a regressor has recently been shown to possibly introduce spurious anti-correlations (  ). We did not include the global mean as a nuisance regressor, thus, it is possible that differences between our findings and previous findings may be due to methodological differences. However, there was a high degree of consistency between our findings and findings from schizophrenia studies. Another difference between our study and previous studies is the use of motion scrubbing, or regressing out or otherwise removing motion outliers from the analysis. Head motion has been shown to decrease the strength of long-range connections (  ), which may account for some of the observed discrepant findings. As these methodological issues (global mean signal, motion scrubbing) have only recently come to light, it remains to be seen which findings are consistent when employing (versus not) these advanced analytic techniques.    Psychosis is thought to occur along a continuum with schizophrenia at one end and non-clinical psychosis at the low end (  ). In line with this hypothesis, studying non-clinical and pre-clinical (i.e., prodromal period) psychosis allows for the investigation of neural mechanisms underlying psychosis in the absence of confounding issues such as side-effects related to chronic medication. The current findings suggest that disruptions in connectivity between cingulo-opercular network regions and default mode and cerebellar regions. These findings were supported by between group comparisons as well as correlational analyses with positive symptom scores. However, the stronger connectivity between control regions (e.g., between IPL and DLPFC) for NCP versus control participants speaks against the psychosis continuum, as connectivity between such control regions has been shown to be reduced in schizophrenia patients and their unaffected siblings compared to controls (  ). One possibility is that the increased frontal connectivity in NCP individuals represents a protective factor or resilience for psychosis. Indeed, connectivity strength of the IPL and premotor cortex with cerebellar regions was negatively correlated with symptom scores. However, there were no correlations between frontal region connectivity and symptom scores.    Although the present study includes several improvements on our previous investigations in individuals reporting NCPs (i.e., sampling for a healthy control group exhibiting a range of PLEs instead of an \u201cextreme\u201d low NCP group, including the B module of the SCID and employing a gold standard NCP assessment) and employs conservative movement parameters, there are some limitations as well. The findings should be viewed as preliminary due to the relatively small sample size and utilization of an undergraduate population, which may limit generalizability. It is important to note that the NCP construct is complex, and affected by numerous other interacting factors including environmental influences such as social disadvantage (  ) and cannabis use (  ). Future higher-powered studies should evaluate the effects of substance use, examine for any differences in those who experience distress related to the reported symptoms, and examine the middle percentiles on the CAPE. Longitudinal imaging studies examining both functional correlates (utilizing anticorrelations) and a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests found to be affected in formal psychosis (e.g., Research Domain Criteria recommended constructs) will help to progress our understanding of how the lower side of the psychosis continuum ultimately relates to formal psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia.", "utf8_text_md5_checksum": "21d04a33bbc81d57f9bfd1dc1e16c407"}
