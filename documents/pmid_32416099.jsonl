Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have probed the neural basis of this emotional enhancement effect on encoding processes, while relatively fewer studies have examined retrieval. Neuroimaging meta-analysis methods can summarize the brain regions associated with emotional episodic memory that are consistently activated across multiple studies. A previous ALE (Activation Likelihood Estimation) meta-analysis identified consistent activations associated with successful encoding of episodic emotional memory in the amygdala, hippocampus, and in multiple neocortical regions (Murty et al., 2010). However, since that study, meta-analysis methods have improved, and many new relevant neuroimaging studies have been published. Moreover, although qualitative reviews have summarized brain activations related to the successful retrieval of emotional episodic memory, no corresponding quantitative meta-analyses have yet been reported. Here we conducted neuroimaging meta-analyses of successful emotional memory encoding and rretrieval using Seed-based d Mapping (SDM). Relevant neuroimaging studies reporting whole-brain fMRI correlates of successful encoding and retrieval of emotional episodic memory were selected for analysis. For successful emotional memory encoding, SDM activations were found bilaterally in the medial temporal lobe (amygdala, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), bilaterally in visual processing regions (middle temporal, gyrus, fusiform gyrus and occipital cortex) and bilaterally in the temporal pole, orbitofrontal cortex, insula, putamen, and the inferior and middle temporal gyri. In contrast to the prior meta-analysis, SDM activations were not observed in the inferior frontal gyrus or in parietal regions. For successful emotional episodic memory retrieval, SDM activations were observed in the medial temporal lobe (bilateral amygdala, left hippocampus, and left entorhinal cortex and perirhinal cortex), visual processing regions (bilateral occipital cortex and right middle temporal gyrus), prefrontal cortex (bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral precentral gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, right frontal pole) and other regions in the left hemisphere including the temporal pole, insula, putamen, angular gyrus, and parietal opercular cortex. Considerable overlap was observed between the encoding and retrieval meta-analysis maps in the medial temporal lobe (bilateral amygdala, left hippocampus, entorhinal, and perirhinal cortex), visual processing regions (bilateral occipital cortex, right middle temporal gyrus), and other regions including the left orbitofrontal cortex, left insula, left putamen, left pallidum, and left temporal pole. The current findings add to current understanding of the role of the amygdala, hippocampus, and neocortical regions in the successful encoding and retrieval of emotional episodic memory, clarify and provide an important summary of the current literature in this area, and have implications for current theories of emotional episodic memory encoding and retrieval.
