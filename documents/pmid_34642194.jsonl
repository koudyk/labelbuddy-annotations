Several clinical trials in the past decade failed to find solutions, and there remains a lack of an effective treatment. The evidence suggests that early intervention for neurodegeneration would likely be effective in preventing cognitive decline. Cognitive decline in AD occurs continuously over a long period; however, there remains a lack of simple, rapid and accurate approach for diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive decline due to underlying Alzheimer's pathology. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) determines the functional activities of the human brain non-invasively. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) are rs-fMRI indicators with high repeatability. They have been studied as early diagnostic imaging markers for other diseases and may be promising markers also for AD. The following electronic literature databases will be searched from inception to December 2021: Medline-Ovid, Medline-PubMed, EMBase-Ovid, Cochrane Central and ClinicalTrials.gov. Two independent reviewers will select studies with eligible criteria, extract data and assess the quality of the original studies with our quality assessment tool individually. Missing data will be requested by sending emails to the corresponding authors. Brain regions will be presented for ALFF/fALFF and ReHo by performing activation likelihood estimation with the Seed-based  This study does not require formal ethical approval. The findings will be submitted to a peer-review journal.
