To explore this issue, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis of regional homogeneity studies to identify significant changes of local connectivity. Our analyses revealed local functional under-connectivity patterns in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex and superior frontal gyrus (key components of the default mode network) and in the bilateral paracentral lobule (a part of the sensorimotor network). We also performed a functional association analysis of the identified areas, whose dysfunction is clinically consistent with the well-known deficits affecting individuals with ASD. Importantly, we did not find relevant clusters of local hyper-connectivity, which is contrary to the hypothesis that ASD may be characterized by generalized local over-connectivity. If confirmed, our result will provide a valuable insight into the understanding of the complex ASD pathophysiology.
