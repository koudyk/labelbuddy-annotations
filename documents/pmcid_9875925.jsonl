We aimed to identify network connectivity that may alter the negative effect of A\u03b2 on cognition. Following assessment of memory performance, resting\u2010state fMRI, and mean cortical PET\u2010A\u03b2, a total of 364 older adults (286 with clinical dementia rating [CDR\u20100], 59 with CDR\u20100.5 and 19 with CDR\u20101, mean age: 74.0\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4\u2009years) from the OASIS\u20103 sample were included in the analysis. Across all participants, a partial least squares regression showed that lower connectivity between posterior medial default mode and frontoparietal networks, higher within\u2010default mode, and higher visual\u2013motor connectivity predict better episodic memory. These connectivities partially mediate the effect of A\u03b2 on episodic memory. These results suggest that connectivity strength between the precuneus cortex and the superior frontal gyri may alter the negative effect of A\u03b2 on episodic memory. In contrast, education was associated with different functional connectivity patterns. In conclusion, functional characteristics of specific brain networks may help identify amyloid\u2010positive individuals with a higher likelihood of memory decline, with implications for AD clinical trials. \n  \nZhukovsky et al. show that connectivity of the posterior medial default mode network with frontoparietal areas mediates the relationship between amyloid\u2010beta levels and episodic memory. In contrast, education was associated with different functional connectivity patterns.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nLate\u2010onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests with loss of episodic memory (Weston et al.,\u00a0 ; Zimmermann & Butler,\u00a0 ). A defining feature of AD is the \u201cpreclinical\u201d phase before the manifestation of clinically significant amnesia, when individuals have elevated cortical amyloid (Dubois et al.,\u00a0 ; Sperling et al.,\u00a0 ). The neurotoxic accumulation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) appears in preclinical AD (Jack Jr et al.,\u00a0 ), and later sparks the emergence of other pathologies, such as hyperphosphorylated tau (Jack et al.,\u00a0 ). Although A\u03b2 is the main target of most treatment trials (Donohue et al.,\u00a0 ; Papp et al.,\u00a0 ; Sevigny et al.,\u00a0 ; Sperling et al.,\u00a0 ), many A\u03b2 positive individuals do not develop AD or episodic memory impairment (Iacono et al.,\u00a0 ; Roberts et al.,\u00a0 ). In other words, not every individual with preclinical AD pathology develops symptomatic AD in late life. Brain function may be one of the factors that distinguish A\u03b2 positive individuals who develop amnestic symptoms, from those who remain cognitively normal. \n\nLarge\u2010scale brain systems or intrinsic connectivity networks support diverse cognitive abilities, including episodic memory (Burianova & Grady,\u00a0 ; Nyberg et al.,\u00a0 ; Rugg & Vilberg,\u00a0 ). In AD, increased connectivity between frontal brain areas and the posterior subsystem of the default mode network (DMN) may precede the onset of cognitive symptoms (Jones et al.,\u00a0 ). However, it is unclear whether this change in connectivity facilitates A\u03b2 spread (Palmqvist et al.,\u00a0 ) or acts as a compensatory change aiming to preserve cognition (resilience hypothesis). In healthy adults, functional connectivity (FC) within the DMN is associated with lower brain age (younger than the actual age), indicative of brain reserve (Ewers,\u00a0 ). Moreover, frontal regions that are part of cognitive control and salience networks play a role in brain reserve, despite having high A\u03b2 deposition (Jack et al.,\u00a0 ; Zhou et al.,\u00a0 ). In older adults, connectivity hubs within the frontoparietal network (FPN) appear to ameliorate the association between vascular brain lesions and cognitive function (Benson et al.,\u00a0 ). Thus, connectivity strength, within and between the DMN and FPN, may be an important biological substrate of resilience and susceptibility in preclinical AD (Ewers et al.,\u00a0 ). However, given the weak brain\u2013behavior associations, replication in additional cohorts with elevated amyloid is desirable. \n\nNetwork connectivity in preclinical AD may also be shaped by social factors, such as education. For example, greater number of years of education predicts better volumetric integrity of the posterior medial DMN (Coughlan et al.,\u00a0 ), which is closely linked with overall functional integrity, and appears to delay the onset of cognitive decline (Franzmeier et al.,\u00a0 ; Mungas et al.,\u00a0 ; Staekenborg et al.,\u00a0 ; Wilson et al.,\u00a0 ). The longitudinal trajectory of an individual's brain network organization is associated with educational attainment (Chan et al.,\u00a0 ). This suggests that education may mitigate the effect of AD pathology on the brain. Further, education may serve to delay the onset of AD symptoms (Clouston et al.,\u00a0 ). However, the education effect may act on network subsystems that are independent of cognitive networks affected by A\u03b2. \n\nHere, we investigated pairwise FC between 21 independent components (ICs) of major brain networks. This fine\u2010grained parcellation of networks allows us to examine subsystems within the brain's large\u2010scale network. FC was estimated in cognitively normal (CDR\u20100) adults and adults with subtle cognitive impairment (CDR 0.5) who had varying levels of A\u03b2. Our previous work showed that both the precuneus and superior frontal gyrus are structural features of brain reserve (Coughlan et al.,\u00a0 ). Therefore, we hypothesized that posterior medial DMN to superior frontal FPN connectivity would be associated with episodic memory (following multiple comparison correction of all other 60 network connections) and would mediate the effect of A\u03b2 on episodic memory. We also tested whether educational attainment was associated with the same network subsystems that mediate the association between A\u03b2 and episodic memory. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Data \n  \nData used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database ( ; accessed: April 4, 2020), collected by the Washington University Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center over the course of 15\u2009years. Beyond OASIS inclusion criteria, the current study required the availability of 3\u00a0T resting\u2010state fMRI, PET scans for A\u03b2, and episodic memory assessments. All participants gave informed consent, and ethical approval was obtained by the institutional review board of Washington University School of Medicine. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were selected from the OASIS\u20103 cohort of 1098 subjects. Participants were excluded if they had an active psychiatric or neurological diagnosis, including epilepsy, alcoholism, or head trauma, and/or had a current diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, or Frontotemporal dementia and other active neurological disorders. History of a single stroke or transient ischemic attack was not an exclusion criterion unless it was related to symptomatic onset of cognitive impairment. Following exclusions, 420 participants with quality\u2010controlled fMRI data and amyloid\u2010\u03b2 data remained (Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nOverview of sample demographics used in the PLS analyses \n    \n\n### A\u03b2   PET   and   fMRI   acquisition \n  \nA\u03b2 values were acquired via PET scanning with the use of one of two tracers: Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) or (18F) AV\u201045 florbetapir. Values are reported as standard\u2010uptake\u2010value\u2010ratio (SUVR), and partial volume correction was applied via the regional spread function (RSF) in the PET Unified Pipeline (PUP) (Su et al.,\u00a0 ), using the Desikan\u2013Kiliany atlas (Desikan et al.,\u00a0 ;  ). The majority of participants' amyloid scans used PIB (  n  \u00a0=\u00a0354), as only 66 participants had an AV\u201045 scan. To correct the effects of tracer, we used the residuals of a linear model with mean cortical A\u03b2 levels and tracer. Cerebellum was used as the reference region. Cutoffs were defined based on OASIS\u20103 guidelines (LaMontagne et al.,\u00a0 ). More details on data acquisition, timing, and processing are available in LaMontagne et al. ( ). Siemens 3\u00a0T scanners were used to obtain blood oxygenation level\u2010dependent (BOLD) signaling data. Data were preprocessed using the Freesurfer image analysis suite as described in LaMontagne et al.,\u00a0  and downloaded from XNAT central. The most common parameter combination of the resting\u2010state fMRI data was: voxel size\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u20094\u00a0\u00d7\u20094\u2009mm , TE\u00a0=\u00a00.027\u2009s, TR\u00a0=\u00a02.2\u00a0s, and scan duration\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0min. In our baseline analyses, only one participant had an fMRI sequence with TR\u00a0=\u00a02.5\u00a0s and one fMRI sequence comprised 163 instead of 164 volumes. In the follow\u2010up analyses, only one fMRI sequence comprised 163 instead of 164 volumes and 30 sequences had a TR\u00a0=\u00a02.5\u00a0s. \n\n\n###  fMRI   processing \n  \nWe used the FSL processing pipeline (Alfaro\u2010Almagro et al.,\u00a0 ). Specifically, we downloaded fMRI data in BIDS format from OASIS and applied FSL FEAT (v3.15) for fMRI preprocessing (removing the first three volumes, linear detrending of 100\u2009s, and smoothing with a kernel of 5\u2009mm). We then used MELODIC (Beckmann and Smith, FMRIB Technical Report TR02CB1) to estimate subject\u2010level ICs and applied in\u2010house developed software, Alternative Labeling Tool, ALT (Zhukovsky, Coughlan, et al.,\u00a0 ), to label these components as signal or noise. ALT reduces motion artifacts and performs similarly to hand classification. We regressed out the noise components (with    fsl_regfilt   ), thus obtaining denoised data. All the above preprocessing occurred in subject space. We used Freesurfer structural image segmentations (downloaded from OASIS3) to leverage the high\u2010quality, nonlinear registration to MNI152 space. Freesurfer   reg\u2010feat2anat   command was used to complete the registrations. We mapped each participant's denoised data to the MNI152 space and assessed the registration quality using   slicesidir  . Participants with mean relative RMS of more than 0.3 were excluded from the analyses to ensure high data quality (Parkes et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Network connectivity estimation \n  \nIn constructing functional connectomes, a data\u2010driven parcellation was obtained from a group\u2010level ICA in 4000 healthy older participants from the UK Biobank. The original ICA analysis was set at 25 ICs, four of which were considered noise. The 21 signal ICs yielded 210 (i.e., ([21*21]\u2009\u2212\u200921)/2) unique pairwise connections, each of which was examined separately. ICs are discrete constellations of fMRI voxels that represent resting\u2010state subnets whose activity is independent from each other. Timeseries data was extracted for the 21 components using   fslmeants  . We used   FSLNets   ( ) to generate connectivity matrices using ridge\u2010regularized partial connectivity that were subsequently analyzed. We previously mapped these 21 ICs onto the Yeo 7\u2010network parcellation (Yeo et al.,\u00a0 ) in MNI152 space (Zhukovsky, Wainberg, et al.,\u00a0 ), to contextualize the spatial locations of the ICs within the brain's largest networks (Visual, Somatomotor, Dorsal/Ventral Attention, Limbic, Frontoparietal, and DMNs). We favored a data\u2010driven parcellation as it captures large\u2010scale aspects of brain networks and allows us to directly compare our results to findings from a large\u2010scale UK Biobank data set. \n\n\n### Cognitive status and episodic memory \n  \nCognitive status and neuropsychological assessment included The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, a Dementia Staging Instrument, which was used to characterize participants with normal cognition (CDR\u20100) or subtle cognitive impairment (CDR\u20100.5). This is a commonly used clinical outcome measure in clinical trials (Morris,\u00a0 ; Sevigny et al.,\u00a0 ). The Mini\u2010Mental State Examination (MMSE) indicated participants' global cognitive function in the domains of orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language (Arevalo\u2010Rodriguez et al.,\u00a0 ). Immediate and delayed recall of episodic information were tested using the recall of story passages from the Logical Memory II subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS; story units recall version) (Elwood,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \n#### Relations between global A\u03b2, connectivity networks, and delayed episodic memory \n  \nPartial least squares (PLS) regression (Chong & Jun,\u00a0 ; De Jong,\u00a0 ) was used to assess the relation between FC and episodic memory. For models featuring memory as the outcome, and for the multivariate brain\u2013memory relationships, only the MRI scan within a year of the cognitive assessment was included, leading to a moderate reduction in the sample size (  n  \u00a0=\u00a0364). We regressed out age, sex, and mean relative RMS from the FC data, while regressing out age, sex, and the absolute time differences between the fMRI scan and memory assessment from episodic memory data. As a result, the predictor matrix X included 210 partial pairwise connectivities (364\u2009\u00d7\u2009210), while the outcome matrix Y included delayed memory recall scores (number of logical units remembered from a story; 364\u2009\u00d7\u20091). Following previous PLS applications (Morgan et al.,\u00a0 ; Zhukovsky, Wainberg, et al.,\u00a0 ), we used permutation testing (  n  \u00a0=\u00a05000) to assess whether PLS latent variables explained a significant amount of variance in memory. During each permutation, memory scores were shuffled randomly and the PLS was repeated, whereby we recorded the amount of variance in the permuted outcome explained by the PLS model. For significance testing, we calculated   p   values as the proportion of permutations on which the percentage of variance explained in the memory outcome was greater than in the PLS with nonpermuted data. If, in more than 5% of permutations, the \u201crandom\u201d PLS explained more variance in the outcome than in the nonpermuted model, then the model was deemed nonsignificant. We used bootstrapping (  n  \u00a0=\u00a05000) to generate Z\u2010regression weights for each of the predictors, indicating which network connectivity predictors robustly contributed to the latent PLS variable. A threshold of |Z|\u2009>\u20093 was used to determine the predictors that were robustly associated with episodic memory performance. \n\nFinally, we then created two mediation models to test whether FC mediates the relationship between A\u03b2 and memory. While the mediator in the first model was the latent variable from the PLS summarizing 19 connectivities, the mediator in the second model was the connectivity between the posteromedial DMN\u201020 and FPN\u20106. Significance was assessed using 5000 bias\u2010corrected bootstrap estimates of their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). \n\n\n#### Effects of education \n  \nWe assessed the relationship between years of education and within\u2010 and between\u2010network connectivity (  n  \u00a0=\u00a0420), controlling for A\u03b2 levels and CDR status. The general linear models testing for the main effects of education are summarized below: Outliers (>3 standard deviations from the mean) were removed (Anderson et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n### Repeating   PLS   and mediation analyses in a partially overlapping sample with data collection at different time points \n  \nMemory performance, resting\u2010state fMRI, and PET\u2010A\u03b2 scans were collected as part of different visits in OASIS3. For the main analysis, we used only baseline data, with data matching keeping the MRI scan within a year of the A\u03b2 scan for linear models with FC as the outcome. \n\nTo extend our findings, we used a different data alignment approach, conducting the cross\u2010sectional PLS and mediation analyses in an OASIS sample that partially overlapped with the original sample (  n  \u00a0=\u00a0361). In this analysis, we used all available time points to find the assessments that were as close together as possible (Supporting Information). fMRI scan times were matched as close as possible to the time of the PET scan. While 90% of the participants in this sample (Figure\u00a0 ) were also part of the main analysis of the baseline sample, this additional cross\u2010sectional analysis included different time points. As a result, only 47% of scans overlapped between the main analysis and the additional analysis. The sample used in this additional analysis was on average 1\u2009year older than the baseline sample (75.2 vs. 74.0\u2009years of age). As before, the PLS predictor matrix X (361\u2009\u00d7\u2009210) included 210 connectivities, and the outcome matrix included delayed memory recall (361\u2009\u00d7\u20091). Finally, we used the beta\u2010weights obtained in our main PLS to predict memory performance from FC data obtained primarily in the same participants with unique time points (  n  \u00a0=\u00a0191). We use a correlation between observed and predicted memory scores to assess \u201cout\u2010of\u2010sample\u201d performance of our PLS model. \n\nWe next attempted to extend the mediation findings using this partially overlapping sample. The mediator in the first model was the latent variable from the PLS summarizing 19 connectivities, the mediator in the second model was the connectivity between the posteromedial DMN\u201020 and FPN\u20106. \n\n\n### Data availability statement \n  \nData used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the OASIS\u20103 database ( ) and are freely available after registration. All code is made available on the following GitHub account ( ). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nAn overview of sample demographics is shown in Table\u00a0 . The OASIS\u20103 sample was predominantly Caucasian (60 African\u2010Americans, 3 Asians, 357 Caucasians, 418 Non\u2010Hispanic, and 2 Hispanic participants). As expected, the CDR\u20101 and CDR\u20100.5 groups were older than the CDR\u20100 group. We also found significant main effects of CDR on the MMSE. Relative RMS displacement of the fMRI images was relatively low, with <10% of participants being excluded since they showed mean RMS\u2009>\u20090.3. Mean framewise displacement (FD) measured after fMRI preprocessing was minimal across all groups, with no significant differences between CDR groups. \n\n\n### FC associated with delayed episodic memory recall \n  \nWe tested whether network connectivity was related to memory. Our PLS model featuring three latent variables explained 45.63% of the variance in delayed memory recall (P \u00a0=\u20090.032, Figure\u00a0 ). We focus on the PLS1 variable, which explained 18% of the variance in memory recall (Figure\u00a0 ). Ten connectivities with normalized PLS1 weights   Z  \u00a0<\u2009\u22123 (highlighted in blue Figure\u00a0 ), and 9 connectivities with   Z  \u00a0>\u20093 (highlighted in red in Figure\u00a0 ) were identified. Importantly, lower connectivity between the posterior medial DMN and lateral frontal proportion of the FPN (IC\u201020 with IC\u20106 or IC\u20101 with IC\u201016), was associated with better delayed recall of episodic information. On the other hand, higher visuo\u2010motor and within\u2010DMN connectivity were associated with better delayed recall. In Figure\u00a0 , connectivities highlighted in blue loaded positively on PLS1, with higher connectivity resulting in higher PLS1 scores, and worse memory. Conversely, connectivities highlighted in red loaded negatively on PLS1, with higher connectivity resulting in lower PLS scores and better memory. Participants with CDRs of 0.5 and 1 showed worse memory performance (see Table\u00a0 ) and lower FC brain scores on PLS1 (  F  \u00a0=\u200915.3,   p  \u00a0=\u00a04e\u22127) than those with CDR\u20100. \n  \nBrain\u2013cognition relationship between partial functional connectivity (FC) and delayed memory recall. The loadings of these components on PLS1 and their respective association with memory are shown in (a). These relationships are tested in a multivariate partial least squares (PLS) regression, which generates a latent variable PLS1 (a), whose scores were found to predict worse memory recall (  R  \u00a0=\u20090.426,   p  \u00a0<\u2009.001). PLS1 scores were significantly lower in participants with CDR\u20101 and CDR\u20100.5 compared to CDR\u20100 (  F  \u00a0=\u200915.3,   p  \u00a0=\u00a04e\u22127). PLS1 weights with |Z|\u2009>\u20093 weights are shown in (b). Higher connectivity of the frontoparietal and default mode independent components (ICs) predicted worse memory recall (e.g., DMN\u201020 to FPN\u20106 and FP/DMN\u201021 to FPN\u20105, and FPN\u20106 to DMN\u20109). Higher visuo\u2010motor and visuo\u2010DMN connectivity were associated with better memory recall. Correlations of key connectivities, A\u03b2, and memory are shown in (c). 95% confidence intervals are shown; more information on the individual FC weights can be found in the Supporting Information. Brain images in (b) show the spatial maps of each IC. A\u03b2, mean cortical A\u03b2 SUVR\u2010resting state functional levels; WMS, Wechsler memory scales. \n  \n\n### Posterior medial   DMN   connectivity with the frontal   FPN   mediates the association between global A\u03b2 and episodic memory \n  \nFinally, we tested whether the partial connectivities identified by PLS mediated the relationship between A\u03b2 and delayed recall of episodic information. Two mediation analyses confirmed first, a significant indirect effect of the latent FC variable, reflecting the connectivity pattern seen in Figure\u00a0 . and second, a significant indirect effect of connectivity between posterior medial DMN (IC\u201020) and lateral frontal FPN (IC\u20106) on the relationship between A\u03b2 and memory (\u22120.02, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.04 to 0.0004; bootstrapped   p  \u00a0<\u2009.05) (Supporting Information for direct effect). \n  \nMediation analyses of the main sample showed a significant indirect effect of the latent PLS1 variable summarizing functional connectivities (FCs) on relationship between A\u03b2 and memory. While we found strong direct effects of amyloid on memory (a), our mediation model showed that higher A\u03b2 levels were associated with lower PLS1 scores (b) and higher DMN\u201020 to FPN\u20106 connectivity (c), which were linked to worse memory recall. \n  \n\n### Additional analyses in an overlapping sample at unique timepoints \n  \nIn the overlapping sample, with a majority of unique time points not included in the original analysis, we found many of the same relationships as shown in Figure\u00a0 . A PLS model featuring four latent variables explained a significant amount of variance in memory (  p  \u00a0=\u2009.038, Figure\u00a0 ). PLS1 explained 20.2% of the variance in memory recall (Figure\u00a0 ). PLS1 implicated many of the connectivities identified in the main analysis, such as DMN\u201020 to FPN\u20106 and DMN\u201020 to DMN\u20107 (Figure\u00a0 ). Our mediation analysis also returned consistent results, showing a significant indirect effect of the latent FC variable and of connectivity between posterior medial DMN (IC\u201020) and lateral frontal FPN (IC\u20106) on the relationship between A\u03b2 and memory (bootstrapped   p  \u00a0<\u20090.05, Table\u00a0 ). \n\nWe were able to achieve moderate out\u2010of\u2010sample performance using the PLS model trained on the main sample to predict memory recall in the sample including unique time points, with predicted versus observed Pearson's correlation of   r  \u00a0=\u2009.17,   p  \u00a0=\u2009.018 (Figure\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Effects of educational attainment on function connectivity \n  \nNext, we tested whether the connectivities associated with education overlap with the connectivities that emerged in our previous analysis. Controlling for global A\u03b2, CDR, age, and sex, weaker connectivity between the IC\u201020 and IC\u201011, and increased connectivity between IC\u201016 and IC\u201014 were associated with more education (Figure\u00a0 ). Most pairwise connectivities associated with education (Figure\u00a0 ) did not overlap with connectivities identified in our PLS analysis (Figure\u00a0 ), although connectivity between components of the default mode, motor, and visual networks were involved in both. \n  \nFunctional connectivity (FC) correlates the education. Education was positively and negatively associated with FC of DMN to motor components, as shown by example associations in (a;   n  \u00a0=\u00a0484). Blue dots represent CDR\u20100 and red dots represent CDR\u20100.5 and CDR\u20101 participants. All significant (permutation   p  \u00a0<\u2009.05) associations between education and FC are shown in (b). Positive associations between education and FC are shown in orange/yellow while negative associations are shown in blue. \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn older adults who are on the AD trajectory, we examined large\u2010scale brain networks that influence the association between elevated A\u03b2 burden and episodic memory. Consistent with the hypothesis that connectivity between the default mode and FPN mediates this A\u03b2\u2010memory association, our structural equation model analyses showed that posterior medial DMN\u2010FPN connectivity partially mediates the A\u03b2\u2010memory association. Education was associated with connectivities including DMN and motor components, after accounting for A\u03b2 and CDR status. Interestingly, education was not associated with A\u03b2 levels. Taken together, these findings suggest educational attainment does not act on network subsystems that mediate the association between preclinical A\u03b2 burden and episodic memory. \n\nThe posterior DMN and the FPN emerged as the key predictors of episodic memory. The PLS analyses confirmed connectivity between these network subsystems mediates the association between A\u03b2 and memory impairment. This finding is consistent with previous reports that higher connectivity of the precuneus with superior frontal regions is associated with poorer cognition (Bagarinao et al.,\u00a0 ). Neuroimaging studies also show that FC of hubs in the FPN and DMN (Ewers,\u00a0 ; Hedden et al.,\u00a0 ; Zhou et al.,\u00a0 ) are associated with AD. Indeed, the posterior DMN regions (including the posterior cingulate and precuneus cortices) in particular have been shown to underpin spatial disorientation and amnesia in the earliest stages of AD (Coughlan et al.,\u00a0 ,  ). \n\nWhile these findings provide valuable insight into brain regions contributing to disease susceptibility, the role of these regions in preserving cognition has been under\u2010explored, particularly when considering how life experience, such as education, may act on connectivities associated with resilience. In our analyses, higher connectivity between the posterior DMN (precuneus cortex, posterior cingulate cortex) and FPN (including superior frontal gyrus) emerged as a key signature of susceptibility to A\u03b2 burden, leading to memory impairment. Our prior work also shows that these brain areas play a key role in structural brain reserve among genetically vulnerable adults, and the structural integrity of these regions is significantly associated with episodic memory (Coughlan et al.,\u00a0 ). Combined with our earlier work, the current findings thus add support to the theory that these select brain regions may mitigate the risk of memory impairment conferred by the A\u03b2. \n\nNevertheless, an important question concerning the interpretation of the increased DMN\u2010FPN connectivity remains: is the increase in DMN\u2010FPN connectivity a sign of a resilience mechanism (Spreng & Turner,\u00a0 ), or connectivity \u201coverload\u201d that is later associated with spread of A\u03b2 (Jones et al.,\u00a0 ). Increased FC between lateral prefrontal FPN regions (implicated in cognitive control) and DMN regions (implicated in self\u2010referential and memory processes) is at the core of the default\u2010executive coupling hypothesis of aging (Spreng & Turner,\u00a0 ; Uddin,\u00a0 ). Task\u2010based fMRI evidence suggests that in healthy aging, lateral FPN regions become less efficient, and compensate for age\u2010related decline in executive function by enhancing their connectivity with anterior and posterior DMN (Adnan et al.,\u00a0 ; Spreng & Turner,\u00a0 ). However, high connectivity between the posterior DMN and frontal hub regions also predicts A\u03b2 accumulation (Jones et al.,\u00a0 ), and the connectivity pattern is later reduced in MCI (Lee et al.,\u00a0 ). Increased FC may be a general compensatory mechanism in aging; however, increased connectivity in those who also have A\u03b2 accumulation may increase the spread of A\u03b2. Higher connectivity with the DMN\u2010FPN suggests that individuals may have a higher probability of showing detectable memory impairment. Treatment targets that reduce hyperconnectivity in the posterior DMN\u2010FPN circuit could potentially alter the course of A\u03b2 deposition and cognitive decline. \n\nIn addition to DMN\u2010FPN connectivity, our PLS analysis also implicated visual and motor networks as correlates of episodic memory. Specifically, hypoconnectivity between the visual and motor network components predicted worse memory outcomes in response to higher A\u03b2. Although less evidence on the role of visual\u2013visual and visual\u2013motor connectivity in preclinical AD is available compared to the DMN\u2010FPN connectivity discussed above, activation likelihood estimation meta\u2010analysis results found diminished primary visual cortex connectivity in MCI and AD (Badhwar et al.,\u00a0 ). Moreover, a large cohort study of healthy older adults found that resting\u2010state correlates of visuospatial memory included parietal\u2013motor networks (Suri et al.,\u00a0 ). Older adults show task\u2010based activation of visual areas during memory encoding and recall (Simon\u2010Vermot et al.,\u00a0 ), while younger adults show task\u2010based visual activation during episodic memory retrieval (Bone & Buchsbaum,\u00a0 ), especially when the stimuli are presented in the visual domain (Bonnici et al.,\u00a0 ). Our findings that unique patterns of both hyper and hypoconnectivity connectivity influence memory impairment in response to A\u03b2 are thus consistent with a role for visuo\u2010motor connectivity in memory recall. However, future studies are needed to understand the role played by visual\u2013motor network connectivity and to test whether these circuits have therapeutic potential. \n\nLifestyle factors subserve network function and include education (Staekenborg et al.,\u00a0 ), verbal intelligence (Boyle et al.,\u00a0 ), physical activity, and sleep (Willetts et al.,\u00a0 ). Interestingly, the network connectivity patterns that mediated the relationship between A\u03b2 and episodic memory were not the same as those associated with education. This suggests that the neural reserve conferred by education does not involve the same network subsystems that are vulnerable to A\u03b2 (i.e., preclinical disease). \n\nOur study has limitations. In healthy participants, previous studies have shown that robust and reproducible brain cognition relationships require thousands of individuals (Marek et al.,\u00a0 ) and a high sample\u2010per\u2010feature ratio (Helmer et al.,\u00a0 ). The effect size of our brain\u2013behavior association is moderate, with multivariate correlations of ~0.42 and univariate correlations of 0.1\u20130.2. These effect sizes are larger than recent large\u2010scale brain\u2010wide association studies in healthy participants (Helmer et al.,\u00a0 ; Marek et al.,\u00a0 ). In the OASIS\u20103 sample, participants showed a wide range of memory performance, some showing early signs of cognitive impairment measured using the CDR. It is possible that such impairments may contribute to larger effects of brain\u2010cognition associations than in more normative population datasets such as UK Biobank or the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. We argue that the comparatively smaller sample size in our analyses can still yield reproducible findings due to potentially larger effects in clinical populations (Gratton et al.,\u00a0 ). Although longitudinal designs optimally address the features underlying the concept of cognitive resilience, rich information can be gained from cross\u2010sectional studies because they provide insight into neurobiological mechanisms and developing research approaches. Further, it is important to consider that age influences the functional organization of the human brain (Setton et al.,\u00a0 ). As both UK Biobank and OASIS\u20103 data sets include older adults, our group ICA generated a similar pattern of findings, however. Moreover, it is important to establish whether DMN\u2010FPN connectivity mediates the relationship between A\u03b2 and other cognitive processes, such as executive function or information processing. \n\nIn conclusion, our results support existing evidence that functional brain properties partially mediate the association between amyloid\u2010\u03b2 and episodic memory. We show that connectivity of the posterior DMN (predominately the precuneus cortex) with the FPN (predominately superior frontal gyri) mediates this association\u2014a finding which is supported by previous work (Cassady et al.,\u00a0 ; Hedden et al.,\u00a0 ). This has clear implications for clinical trials that aim to enroll individuals with elevated amyloid, who have the highest likelihood of suffering cognitive decline during the trial. Future research should examine if connectivity of this circuit may facilitate interventions (Koch et al.,\u00a0 ) and provide a biomarker for outcomes in cognitive remediation trials (Rajji et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9875925, "text_md5": "a57728a3fd83e1c69ea7448d594e55db", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 104], "journal": [105, 119], "publication_year": [121, 125], "title": [136, 267], "keywords": [281, 281], "abstract": [294, 1856], "body": [1865, 32535]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 36420978, "doi": "10.1002/hbm.26148", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9875925", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9875925"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9875925\">9875925</a>", "list_title": "PMC9875925  Connectivity between default mode and frontoparietal networks mediates the association between global amyloid\u2010\u03b2 and episodic memory"}
