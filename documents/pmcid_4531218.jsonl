We aimed to provide evidence for a multi-componential neural system for creativity. We applied a general activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to 45 fMRI studies. Three individual ALE analyses were performed to assess creativity in different cognitive domains (Musical, Verbal, and Visuo-spatial). The general ALE revealed that creativity relies on clusters of activations in the bilateral occipital, parietal, frontal, and temporal lobes. The individual ALE revealed different maximal activation in different domains. Musical creativity yields activations in the bilateral medial frontal gyrus, in the left cingulate gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule and in the right postcentral and fusiform gyri. Verbal creativity yields activations mainly located in the left hemisphere, in the prefrontal cortex, middle and superior temporal gyri, inferior parietal lobule, postcentral and supramarginal gyri, middle occipital gyrus, and insula. The right inferior frontal gyrus and the lingual gyrus were also activated. Visuo-spatial creativity activates the right middle and inferior frontal gyri, the bilateral thalamus and the left precentral gyrus. This evidence suggests that creativity relies on multi-componential neural networks and that different creativity domains depend on different brain regions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe ability to form novel ideas is crucial for human civilization, progress, and innovation. Creativity has been defined as \u201cthe introduction of something innovatively new and positive for society that goes beyond the familiar and accepted\u201d ( , p. 1) and concerns many domains of human activities ( ), such as science, technology, economy, and arts. However, creativity concerns not only exceptional realizations, such as scientific discoveries or the production of artworks, but also everyday activities, such as finding new solutions and thinking away from ordinary ideas. Furthermore, creativity includes the appropriateness ( ;  ) of the new ideas and solutions. The product of creativity must, in fact, involve an actual use in a specific context, rather than a hypothetical use. \n\nEvolution has strongly fostered creativity. Bio-social pressures toward creativity are thought to have shaped the evolution of the human brain ( ). Previous neuroimaging studies failed to find a clear neuroanatomical localization of creative processes (for a review, see  ;  ): creativity does not appear to critically rely on any single brain area and it is not especially associated with the right or left brain hemispheres ( ). The failure to find any clear neuroanatomical localization is likely due to the fact that creativity is a multifaceted process, which is supported by high-level mental operations, both independent (for example, abstraction;  ) and dependent (for example, domain-specific operations) on the specific domains of knowledge.   found that verbal creativity is mostly domain-specific, but can also be affected by processes in the visual domain, whereas visual creativity is domain- and task-specific. Various different approaches and tasks have been used to explore creativity. Some rely on the ability to find one correct solution to closed problems, such as insight problem solving, others rely on the ability to find new, appropriate, and different answers to open-ended problems, such as divergent thinking, creative cognition, and artistic creativity. \n\nThe divergent thinking approach was introduced by  ,  ). The Alternative Uses Task (AUT), which requires individuals to generate as many different alternative uses of a specific object (e.g., a brick) as possible, was initially used to assess divergent thinking in terms of ideational fluency (the number of ideas), flexibility (the number of categories that encompass ideas), originality (infrequency of ideas), and elaboration (the number of details added to basic ideas). In the wake of  ,  ) work,   developed the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT), which was aimed at measuring divergent thinking in verbal and visual forms. Recently, the idea that divergent thinking is an indicator of creative potential without guaranteeing actual creative achievement has emerged ( ). In addition, divergent thinking is supported by convergent thinking for the evaluation of the novelty of ideas ( ). \n\nThe creative cognition approach is mainly based on the \u2018Geneplore\u2019 model ( ;  ) that focuses on mental operations involved in visual creativity. This approach assumes that generative (e.g., memory retrieval, mental synthesis) and exploratory (e.g., conceptual interpretation, functional inference) processes support creativity. Specifically, generative processes support the construction of visual pre-inventive ideas, whereas exploratory processes examine and interpret the pre-inventive ideas. The Geneplore model was operationalized by means of the creative synthesis task ( ,  ), which allows individuals to imagine and manipulate visual elements (e.g., square, wire, and bracket), in order to create an object belonging to a specific category. Independent judges are then asked to score the inventions on the basis of different criteria, such as originality and practicality, according to the Consensual Assessment Technique developed by  . Investigations based on this Model have highlighted, among other things, that mental imagery \u2013 a complex cognitive process arising when perceptual information is accessed from the memory, giving rise to the experience of \u201cseeing with the mind\u2019s eye\u201d ( ;  ) \u2013 seems to have a pivotal role in directing creative processes. This is confirmed by several scientific studies (e.g.,  ;  ). \n\nArtistic creativity has been described in terms of an altered state of mind, beyond conscious awareness ( ). This makes it more difficult to investigate artistic creativity and its cognitive and neural underpinnings. In these last years, the neural processes underlying free generation and selection of possible alternatives have been investigated by using simpler model behaviors, which resemble valid examples of creativity in musical ( ) and visual domains ( ). \n\nDespite the variety of creativity domains, and of the approaches and tasks used, many pivotal processes supporting creativity can be identified. First, executive functions, such as planning, working memory, attention, and semantic memory retrieval are required. These processes facilitate both the selection ( ) and evaluation of the utility of novel ideas ( ). Accordingly, the prefrontal cortex recruitment (e.g., the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex \u2013 DLPFC) has been widely shown as being involved in verbal divergent thinking based on ideational fluency (e.g.,  ;  ), story generation ( ;  ), metaphor production ( ), creative objects production ( ;  ), visual art ( ;  ), and musical improvisation (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). Second, creativity also relies on an associative mode of processing ( ), which is supported by the default mode network (e.g., the medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, temporoparietal junction, part of the medial temporal lobe and the inferior parietal cortex \u2013  ). Interestingly, the default mode network is activated during different creativity performances (e.g.,  ;  ). Third, memory processes also support creativity. The medial temporal lobe (hippocampal and parahippocampal regions) is recruited during verbal divergent thinking ( ), creative writing ( ), metaphor production ( ), visual creativity ( ), and visual art ( ). According to   the connections between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the temporal, occipital and parietal cortices, sites of long-term memory storage (e.g.,  ), are essential for creativity. Furthermore, brain areas generally involved in mental imagery, such as the middle occipital gyrus and parietal lobes ( ;  ;  ), can be recruited during creativity, suggesting a top\u2013down control on the construction of the images, even if visual information is not directly manipulated. \n\nHere we aimed to find the neural correlates of creativity in general and those more strictly correlated with the cognitive domain. In the present study creativity is operationally defined as the ability to find new, appropriate, and different answers to open-ended problems, focusing on the idea that a valid assessment of creativity requires tasks that are sufficiently open-ended to encourage divergent production ( ). We applied a general activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of fMRI experiments on creativity based on open-ended mental problems, to find converging evidence for a neural network for creativity in the human brain. Furthermore, three individual ALE analyses were performed to assess whether creativity in different domains (i.e., Musical, Verbal, and Visuo-spatial) involves different brain areas. The decision to explore Musical, Verbal, and Visuo-spatial creativity was made because these were the only domains in which the number of experiments and critical contrasts was sufficient for statistical testing. \n\nFollowing  , p. 822) idea of functionally subdividing different types of creativity \u201cto make creativity tractable in the brain,\u201d we hypothesized that, beyond a common pattern of brain activations generally underpining idea generation in the attempt to solve open-ended problems, different brain regions underpin different domains of creativity and that a multi-componential neural system underpins creative thinking in humans. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Inclusion Criteria for Papers \n  \nA systematic method was adopted to review the literature. The search was carried out with the aid of PubMed, using the following string: \u201ccreativity and fMRI.\u201d A total of 56 studies were found. \n\nOur   a priori   inclusion criteria for papers were: (1) Inclusion of whole-brain analysis performed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); thus, we excluded positron emission tomography (PET) studies, electrophysiology studies and papers that reported only results from ROI analysis. (2) Provision of coordinates of activation foci, both in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and the Talairach reference space. (3) All participants in the studies had to be young and healthy. (4) Only studies focusing on open-ended mental problems were included in the meta-analysis; thus we excluded studies exploring neural correlates of idea generation based on closed-ended problems, such as problems based on the combination of remote semantic associations, which generally underpin insight (a stage of the creative process) rather than creativity   per se  . This decision was made following the idea that the \u201crigorous investigation of creativity requires tasks that are suitable for quantified psychometrics but also sufficiently open-ended to be construct-valid assays of creativity (i.e., they must allow freedom for divergent production)\u201d ( , p. 924). (5) Only group studies involving a sample size of at least five participants were included. (6) There could be no pharmacological manipulation. (7) Only activation foci were considered. Thus, studies reporting only deactivation foci were excluded from our meta-analysis. (8) Only peer-reviewed original articles were included. Using these criteria we selected 24 articles. The studies are summarized in   Table   , where the subdivision according to domains (Musical, Verbal, and Visuo-spatial) is also shown (see below). \n  \nList of papers included in the meta-analysis for each domain. \n    \n\n### Activation Likelihood Estimation \n  \nThe coordinates from studies identified in 24 published papers were used for ALE, which models the uncertainty in the localization of activation foci using Gaussian probability density distributions ( ). In other words, ALE assesses the overlap between foci by modeling the probability distributions centered at the coordinates of each one ( ). This is calculated at each voxel and results in a thresholded ALE map. The probabilities of all activation foci in a given experiment were combined for each voxel, yielding a modeled activation map ( ). ALE scores quantified the convergence across experiments at each particular location in the brain. ALE scores were compared against an empirical null distribution reflecting a random spatial association between the model activation maps ( ). \n\nWe performed a general ALE meta-analysis on the foci derived from the selected studies (  Table   ). The coordinates of the foci were taken from the original papers. A total of 492 foci were reported in 45 experiments involving 1007 participants. \n\nWe also performed three separate ALE analyses to assess the neural correlates of creativity in different cognitive domains (i.e., Musical, Verbal, and Visuo-spatial). The experimenters (Maddalena Boccia, Laura Piccardi, Liana Palermo, Raffaella Nori, and Massimiliano Palmiero) independently classified the studies. Studies including different cognitive domains were excluded from these analyses: the data from these studies were included in the general analysis but not in the further analyses. Separate ALE analyses were performed on (1) 13 studies assessing musical creativity (219 participants, 197 activation foci), (2) 24 studies assessing verbal creativity (575 participants, 207 activation foci), and (3) six studies assessing visuo-spatial creativity (164 participants, 52 activation foci). \n\nThe ALE meta-analysis was performed using GingerALE  2.3.1 with MNI coordinates (Talairach coordinates were automatically converted into MNI coordinates by GingerALE), according to   procedure. The Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM) value was automatically computed, as this parameter is empirically determined ( ). The thresholded ALE map was corrected for multiple comparisons using False Discovery Rate (FDR), at a 0.05 level of significance. Moreover, a minimum cluster size of 200 mm  was chosen. The ALE results were registered on an MNI-normalized template using MRICRO. Hereafter the link to access MRICRO \n\n\n### Tasks and Contrasts Taken into Account \n  \nRegarding the musical domain, participants were instructed to improvise music of various kinds (Classical, Jazz, etc.) on simple piano keyboards designed for usage in the scanner. In particular, music improvisation performed by modification of a melodic template was contrasted with the memorized improvisation previously made ( ); music improvisation using notes within the C major scale with over-learned tracks ( ); lyric improvisation using an 8-bar instrumental track at 85 beats per minute with the memorized lyrics ( ); melody improvisation and pseudo-random key presses production with sight reading of a musical score ( ); rhythmic (note choice constrained) and melody (note choice free) improvisation with or without metronome click synchronization with the reproduction of simple pre-learned 5-note patterns ( ); rhythm improvisation (based on a rhythm listened to) with the reproduction of the rhythm heard ( ); music improvisation (tonal, atonal, happy, and fearful) with the rest condition ( ). \n\nRegarding the verbal domain, the ability to find alternative uses for an object, such as \u2018a brick\u2019 (AUT), was contrasted with fluency objects for location (indicating different objects in a specific place, such as an office), using the AU vs. 2-back memory ( ) as inclusive mask; the AUT with the fluency object for location and both these tasks with 1- and 2-back memory tasks in males vs. females and vice versa ( ). Furthermore, new ideas (unknown) provided by the AUT were contrasted with old ideas (recruited from the memory), and both new/old ideas vs. zero ( ), whereas common or uncommon uses of objects were contrasted with a perceptual baseline task ( ). The AUT was also contrasted with the object characteristic task (find typical characteristics of objects), the Incubation-AUT (reflect on ideas and elaborate them) with the standard AUT and vice versa, the Stimulation-AUT (the stimulus word was presented with three other people\u2019s ideas) with the standard AUT ( ); the Stimulation-AUT (original/common ideas of other people) with the control condition (the stimulus word was presented with two pseudowords) and the Stimulation-AUT (original) with Stimulation-AUT (common), ( ). In addition, the generation of metaphor was contrasted with the production of literal responses (synonyms of adjectives;  ); the unusual or creative generation of verbs in response to specific nouns with the generation of verbs that first came to mind ( ) or with uncreative verbs ( ); the generation of creative stories from three words with uncreative stories and the generation of stories from unrelated words with stories from related words in the set ( ); the creative writing was contrasted with the copying of a given text ( ); the generation of inventive conceptions (biological functional feature associations) with ordinary conceptions (non-biological functional feature associations) and with baseline ( ). \n\nRegarding the visuo-spatial domain, the generation of unique responses to Rorschach\u2019s test was contrasted with the generation of frequent responses ( ); the creative synthesis task (combination of three shapes, such as a circle, an \u20188\u2019 and a \u2018C, to form a creative object) with the reconstruction of a shape by combining three distinct stimuli in which the original shape was trisected ( ); the generation of ideas while designing book cover illustrations with the evaluation of ideas generated ( ); the generation of creative pictures based on given visual clues with the generation of uncreative figures not necessarily unique ( ). Finally,   explored the neural correlates of designing of a new pen in experts and novices. \n\n\n### Results \n  \n#### Neural Correlates of Creativity \n  \nThe general ALE meta-analysis showed clusters of activations ranging from the occipital to the frontal lobe (  Table   ), in both the left and the right hemispheres (  Figure   ). Specifically, we found consistent activations in the bilateral inferior, middle and medial frontal gyri as well as in the bilateral middle occipital gyrus. In the left hemisphere we found consistent activations in the precentral gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, supramarginal gyrus, insula, cingulate gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus.

First of all, we performed a general ALE analysis to give a general picture of the brain networks involved in creativity. Then three separate ALE analyses were performed in order to assess the neural correlates of creativity in Musical, Verbal, and Visuo-spatial domains. We found a wide network of areas, ranging from the occipital to the frontal lobe, in both left and right hemispheres. A functional specialization was found within this network for different types of creativity, confirming  , p. 822) idea that distinguishing different types of creativity is valuable \u201cto make creativity tractable in the brain.\u201d This is also in line with the hypothesis of the existence of a functional multi-componential system in the human brain for creative thinking. Even if previous quantitative meta-analyses on creativity have been made ( ), to our knowledge this is the first meta-analysis clearly disentangling the brain regions underpinning musical, verbal, and visuo-spatial creativity, based on the generation of creative solutions to open-ended problems. \n\nSpecifically, the recruitment of executive functions is crucial for creativity. The activations found in the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), as well as in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri and middle frontal gyri (DLPFC), may be strictly connected to \u201cmore executive\u201d aspects of creativity, since these areas are activated during conditions of high cognitive control ( ). In particular, activation of the DLPFC is correlated with effortful problem-solving, monitoring, and focused attention ( ). DLPFC also plays a key role in the selection process ( ), being linked to extra working memory load due to keeping in mind different alternatives ( ) and comparing many different stimuli. Thus, although these processes were not directed tested, it is not surprising that the DLPFC was found to be consistently activated during Musical (right hemisphere), Verbal (left hemisphere), and Visuo-spatial (right hemisphere) creativity, which generally require effortful problem solving, focused attention, selection process and working memory. \n\nConcerning specific-domain activations, we found that verbal creativity consistently activated the left inferior frontal gyrus. Since verbal creativity has been reported to require the ability to integrate distant semantic concepts or ideas in a new fashion ( ;  ;  ), by means of semantic retrieval and selection of stored knowledge ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), these processes may well have entailed the activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus. On the other hand, attentional processes ( ) and successful response inhibition (e.g.,  ) may entail activations of the right inferior frontal gyrus. However, these activations were found both during verbal and visuo-spatial creativity, but not during musical improvisation, which seems to rely more upon response inhibition. Thus, although one might claim that the inhibition of competitive responses during the creative act is supported by the right inferior frontal gyrus, the functional role of this area while performing on musical, verbal or visuo-spatial creativity tasks needs to be more fully addressed. \n\nThe high cognitive control during musical and verbal creativity also induced activations of the left inferior parietal lobule. Hemispheric specialization has been proposed for this area. Specifically, verbal attention ( ), and language-related processes with a focus on semantic and phonological issues ( ) were found to recruit the left inferior parietal lobule, which also belongs to the default mode network ( ). Furthermore, although the activations of the left inferior parietal lobule, supramarginal gyrus and insula shown by the general ALE analysis might also indicate multimodal sensory processing and the representation of subjective experience during spontaneous creativity ( ), further study is necessary to better clarify this issue. \n\nInterestingly, musical and visuo-spatial creativity activate regions involved in motor planning, such as the right supplementary and the left premotor cortices, probably indicating that a motor and temporal planning is crucial for creative musical improvisation ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), as well as in the visuo-spatial rotation of objects ( ) during visuo-spatial creativity. \n\nThe posterior activations found in the temporal (left middle temporal gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus) and occipital (bilateral middle occipital gyrus) lobes across different creativity domains deserve consideration. According to  , the posterior cortices are essential for creativity, being the sites of long-term memory storage (e.g.,  ) and being connected to the prefrontal cortex. Therefore, given that creativity relies on an associative mode of processing, heightening focused attention to stored knowledge that facilitates efficient retrieval and recombination of existing information ( ), the activation of the posterior cortices may be the neural correlates of such processes. Moreover, given that these areas have a pivotal role in generating mental images ( ), these results could also support the relationship between creative processes and mental imagery. Specifically, according to the Perceptual Anticipation Theory, mental images arise when an individual \u201canticipates perceiving an object or scene so strongly that a depictive representation of the stimulus is generated in early visual cortex\u201d ( ; p. 724). Thus, it may be that information stored in the long-term memory is selectively retrieved and used to form mental images, which subtend the generation of creative ideas. Other brain areas are then needed to explore and finalize ideas in different cognitive domains. In this direction, musical creativity showed the activation of the right fusiform gyrus and parietal postcentral gyrus, whereas verbal creativity showed the recruitment of the left middle and superior temporal gyri, right lingual gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, and left parietal postcentral gyrus. \n\nFinally, the right posterior cerebellum was recruited in both verbal and musical creativity, indicating searching processes for appropriate responses ( ). Such a result suggests that the cerebellum may have an important role in creativity. Indeed, by permitting previously executed movements, which have been proved to be advantageous, the cerebellum allows individual motor sequences to be consolidated into more complex patterns underlying the generation of novel creative outcomes ( ). However, due to the lack of systematic studies on this issue, the specific role of the cerebellum in creativity is still unclear. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe results of the present meta-analysis of fMRI studies of creatvity based on open-ended problems in musical, verbal, and visuo-spatial domains suggest that different domains of creativity roughly correspond to a higher activation in functionally specialized brain areas. In general, frontal areas seem to be crucial for idea generation, although there are slight differences across creativity domains. Activation of the DLPFC was found in all creativity domains under investigation, whereas the inferior frontal gyrus was recruited consistently in verbal creativity and weakly in visuo-spatial creativity. This finding suggests that creativity relies on the activation of the prefrontal cortex, which likely works as an executive engine, managing attentional recourses, retrieving, and selecting appropriate information. Future studies should take into account the \u2018gateway hypothesis\u2019 ( ), which highlights the role of the rostral prefrontal cortex on attending behavior that enhances the ability to notice change in the environment (stimulus-oriented cognition) as well as on self-generated or maintained representations (stimulus-independent cognition). Focusing on this latter ability, the lateral rostral prefrontal cortex would work as a \u2018gateway\u2019 between the process of selection of actions or thought operations and the stimulus-independent attending system, ensuring that activation of representations is less affected by sensory input. This is exactly the case of creativity, which is mainly based on stimulus-independent processes, retrieval of information from the memory and selection of the most appropriate responses to satisfy specific criteria, such as originality and appropriateness. Unfortunately the gateway hypothesis has never been directly tested by means of a paradigm investigating creativity. \n\nInterestingly, part of the default network (the left inferior parietal lobule) and different temporal, parietal, and occipital areas were found to be recruited while performing on musical and verbal creativity, but not when performing on visual creativity. Also the right posterior cerebellum was activated during both musical and verbal creative processes. Thus, the present meta-analysis would seem to indicate that musical and verbal creativity share common areas that involve attentional, searching, and associative modes of processing of stored knowledge from the posterior cortices, and temporarily represent information in the working memory buffer with the aid of prefrontal areas. On the contrary, visuo-spatial creativity would appear to rely consistently on the perception and manipulation of visual stimuli, such as the rotation of shapes; in this direction, visuo-spatial creativity strongly yielded activations in the bilateral thalamus and premotor cortices, the former being involved in relaying sensory information, the latter in finalizing in a top\u2013down fashion the goal-directed planning of novel ideas. However, it is surprising that visuo-spatial creativity did not produce the activation of any temporal, parietal, and above all occipital regions, considering that the recruitment of these areas was reported in various studies of visual creativity (e.g.,  ). Probably, given the scarcity of the number of experiments (6\u2013164 participants, 52 activation foci) belonging to the visuo-spatial domain, the ALE analysis did not highlight these results, thus making the findings somewhat less reliable. \n\nTherefore, generally speaking, creativity seems to emerge when the prefrontal cortex, posterior temporal, and parietal areas are recruited. This is also confirmed by studies with dementia patients (for a review, see  ), who show a decline in divergent thinking and artistic creativity when these areas are damaged. On the other hand, it is possible that, since all the studies we included in the ALE meta-analysis checked for early visuo-spatial features by using well-designed control conditions, the ALE statistics only showed brain areas more related to general visuo-spatial creative processes, such as premotor regions supporting mental rotation of stimuli, rather than to visual properties   per se  . This is also true in the case of musical creativity, in which we found no activation of the auditory cortex. It should be stressed, though, that all the included studies compared activations during a creative condition (usually assessed by means of musical improvisation) with those during a control condition (usually assessed by means of the reproduction of conventional pieces). The failure to find any activation of the auditory cortex is likely due to the fact that this area is generally involved in musical and auditory processes but it is not directly entailed in musical creativity. \n\nRegarding the lateralization issue, the unbalanced number of studies across the domains could account for the activations mainly of the left hemisphere in the general ALE analysis. However, looking at the separate ALE analyses, musical and verbal creativity showed predominant activations in the left hemisphere, whereas visuo-spatial creativity in the right hemisphere, but a clear laterality effect was not found. This suggests that inter-hemispheric interaction is required in all domains of creative processes ( ) and supports the idea that creative processes are subtended by different brain areas and functional specialized brain regions rather than by a specific brain area. \n\nFinally, on the basis of the findings outlined above, creativity appears to be a multifaceted process, involving different mental functions, and studied using different approaches and tasks. Although the number of experiments and critical contrasts in each category separately is, at present, insufficient for statistical testing, in the future, in order to reach more reliable conclusions, neural correlates of creativity should be studied considering the interaction among the domains, approaches and tasks used. A higher number of studies will also allow for a contrast analysis and a conjunction analysis among different creativity domains, now impossible due to the paucity of the studies. Different creativity domains should also be explored, such as dance and scientific innovation. Of course this meta-analysis was not aimed at determining the specific executive, default and memory processes supported by cerebral regions during creativity. Further studies should therefore explore whether and how idea generation and evaluation emerge in different creativity domains. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4531218, "text_md5": "f99f7b5fcc3b413bf2808e7930553d95", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 103], "journal": [104, 117], "publication_year": [119, 123], "title": [134, 254], "keywords": [268, 419], "abstract": [432, 1892], "body": [1901, 34822]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 26322002, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01195", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4531218", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4531218"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4531218\">4531218</a>", "list_title": "PMC4531218  Where do bright ideas occur in our brain?
