We implemented FreeSurfer to obtain cortical thickness estimates to contrast patterns of cortical thinning across groups and their clinical correlates. \n\n\n## Results: \n  \nIn Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, a largely similar pattern of regional cortical thinning was observed relative to controls apart from a more severe loss within the entorhinal and parahippocampal structures in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In Parkinson disease dementia, regional cortical thickness was indistinguishable from controls and dementia with Lewy bodies, suggesting an \u2018intermediate\u2019 pattern of regional cortical change. In terms of global cortical thickness, group profiles were controls\u2009>\u2009Parkinson disease dementia\u2009>\u2009dementia with Lewy bodies\u2009>\u2009Alzheimer\u2019s disease (F \u2009\u2a7d\u2009123.2,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), where percentage wise, the average difference compared to controls were \u22121.8%, \u22125.5% and \u22126.4%, respectively. In these samples, cortical thinning was also associated with cognitive decline in dementia with Lewy bodies but not in Parkinson disease dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n\n\n## Conclusion: \n  \nIn a large and well-characterised cohort of people with dementia, regional cortical thinning in dementia with Lewy bodies was broadly similar to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. There was preservation of the medial temporal lobe structures in dementia with Lewy bodies compared with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, supporting its inclusion as a supportive biomarker in the revised clinical criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies. However, there was less global cortical thinning in Parkinson disease dementia, with no significant regional difference between Parkinson disease dementia and controls. These findings highlight the overlap across the Alzheimer\u2019s disease/Parkinson disease dementia spectrum and the potential for differing mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and cognition in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) are common forms of dementia in older age, while in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), development of dementia (Parkinson disease dementia [PDD]) occurs in up to 80% of people aged 15\u201320\u2009years after PD diagnosis. Although the neuropsychiatric and cognitive presentation in PDD is broadly similar to DLB ( ), there are differences including timing of the cognitive, neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms as well as treatment responses and underlying neuropathology ( ). \n\nStructural imaging changes are well characterised in AD with temporoparietal atrophy shown to be a relatively specific disease biomarker ( ). In Lewy body disease, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have reported greater cortical atrophy in DLB than in PDD ( ;  ), while relative preservation of the medial temporal lobes compared to AD is a consistent finding across both conditions ( ;  ;  ), and significant medial temporal atrophy may indicate concomitant AD-related pathological change ( ). Studies reporting measures of cortical thickness (CTh) in DLB have shown changes in parietal, occipital, temporal and frontal cortices but to a lesser extent than in AD ( ). Cortical thinning has also been shown to be associated with cognitive impairment and dementia in PD ( ;  ;  ), with cortical changes becoming more widespread as the disease progresses. \n\nOur aim was to determine patterns of cortical thinning in a large and well-characterised cohort of older people with AD, DLB and PDD. Atrophic changes in DLB may lie somewhere between AD and PDD, possibly reflecting increased AD co-pathology, but no study has made direct comparisons between all the three dementia groups. We, therefore, utilised FreeSurfer to estimate CTh from structural MRI data to contrast patterns across these groups. We also investigated the clinical correlates of CTh in order to probe the clinical significance of the neurodegenerative process in these conditions. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe investigation consisted of 245 individuals gathered from four independent study samples: 76 probable AD ( ), 65 probable DLB ( ), 29 PDD ( ) and 76 older controls. Sample characteristics were the following: study 1 (13 controls, 30 AD, 21 DLB and 16 PDD), study 2 (31 controls, 32 AD and 31 DLB), study 3 (17 controls, 13 AD and 13 DLB) and study 4 (15 controls and 13 PDD). People with probable AD, DLB and PDD were recruited from a community-dwelling population of patients referred to local old age psychiatry, geriatric or neurology services. Older cognitively normal control participants were recruited from patient spouses, friends and volunteers. Approval was sought from the Newcastle, North Tyneside and Northumberland research ethics committees. All participants and/or nearest relatives gave written informed consent. All participants had clinical, cognitive, neurological and neuropsychiatric assessments. Cognitive function was evaluated with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) ( ) and Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG) ( ) tests, while motor parkinsonism was assessed using the unified Parkinson\u2019s disease rating scale (UPDRS-III) ( ). For AD, DLB and PDD participants, neuropsychiatric features and cognitive fluctuations were measured with the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) ( ) and the clinician assessment of fluctuations (CAF) scale ( ). \n\nStudy exclusion criteria across samples included contraindications for MRI, history of alcohol or substance misuse, severe neurological or psychiatric illness, focal brain lesions or presence of other severe or medical illness. \n\n\n### MRI \n  \nWithin 2\u2009months of their respective study assessments, all subjects underwent T1-weighted MRI on a 3-T MRI system (8-channel head coil, Intera Achieva scanner; Philips Medical Systems, Eindhoven, The Netherlands), although there were slight variations in the three-dimensional (3D) MPRAGE sequence across samples.

Study 3: sagittal acquisition, matrix 240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009150, TR\u2009=\u20099.6\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u20094.6\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u20098\u00b0, SENSE factor\u2009=\u20092, voxel output 0.94\u2009\u00d7\u20090.94\u2009\u00d7\u20091.2\u2009mm . Study 4: sagittal acquisition, matrix 240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009180, TR\u2009=\u20098.3\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u20094.6\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u20098\u00b0, SENSE factor\u2009=\u20092, voxel output 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009mm . Image volumes were then orientated such that the axial plane was standardised to align with the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line. \n\n\n### Cortical thickness \n  \nCTh estimates were derived for each participant from cortical surface reconstructions of the T1 images using FreeSurfer (version 5.1), the methodological details of which have been described ( ;  ;  ). In short, the analysis pipeline included non-uniform intensity correction, Talairach transformation, removal of non-brain tissue, segmentation of the white matter (WM) and deep grey matter (GM) structures, triangular tessellation of the WM\u2013GM boundary and then surface warping by tracking intensity gradients to optimally identify the WM\u2013GM and GM\u2013CSF (cerebrospinal fluid)/pial borders ( ;  ). Once cortical models were produced, surface inflation, spherical atlas registration and parcellation of the cerebral cortex into gyral and sulcal structures were performed, ( ) thereby generating a series of surface data. Representations of CTh were then calculated as the closest distance from the WM\u2013GM to pial boundaries at each vertex on the tessellated surface ( ). Examination at each step of image processing was performed to confirm the accuracies of segmentation, WM/pial surfaces and tissue classifications. Images with errors that could not be corrected were excluded. Images were then aligned to a common surface space (MNI 305) and smoothed with a 20-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) surface\u2013based Gaussian kernel. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nDemographic and behavioural variables were tested for normality and variance homogeneity using Shapiro\u2013Wilk and Levene\u2019s tests, respectively. Where applicable, the data were examined using parametric (analysis of variance [ANOVA] F, Welch\u2019s ANOVA W) and non-parametric (Kruskal\u2013Wallis H, \u03c7 ) tests and interpreted as significant if   p  \u2009\u2a7d\u20090.05. Analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS v.23.0.0.3. \n\nGroup effects and behavioural correlates on CTh were assessed vertex wise using the general linear model (GLM). CTh was modelled as a function of each group controlling for the effects of age, gender and MRI sequence (analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]), CTh\u2009=\u2009\u03b2 .Con\u2009+\u2009\u03b2 .AD\u2009+\u2009\u03b2 .DLB\u2009+\u2009\u03b2 .PDD\u2009+\u2009\u03b2 .age\u2009+\u2009\u03b2 .gender\u2009+\u2009\u03b2 .MRI_sequence\u2009+\u2009\u03bc\u2009+\u2009\u03b5 (where \u03bc is a constant and \u03b5 is error). An   F   contrast was derived to test whether any differences in mean CTh at each vertex existed between the four groups. The resultant surface map, converted to a binary brain mask, defined the surface subspace from which subsequent post hoc analyses were performed to establish which groups differed from each other. In particular, CTh was then modelled within the surface subspace as a function of two groups along with the nuisance covariates, where   T   contrasts generated specific pairwise comparisons (two-tailed   t   tests): Con vs AD, Con vs DLB, Con vs PDD, AD vs DLB, AD vs PDD and DLB vs PDD. Effects of measures (MMSE, CAMCOG , CAMCOG , NPI , NPI  and CAF ) on CTh were also investigated separately in AD, DLB and PDD. CTh was modelled as a function of covariate of interest, and where appropriate, controlling for effects of age, gender and MRI sequence. These contrasts tested whether the clinical variables significantly correlated with CTh in these conditions. For all analyses, a false discovery rate (FDR) ( ) probability threshold was applied (  P  \u2009\u2a7d\u20090.05), controlling the expected proportion of type I errors among the suprathreshold vertices due to multiple testing across the surfaces. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographics and behavioural characteristics \n  \n depicts the study characteristics. Age was broadly similar across groups; however, PDD patients were slightly younger than DLB patients. The male-to-female ratio was much greater in PDD than in AD, DLB and control participants. Global cognition (MMSE, CAMCOG ) and executive function were similar across AD, DLB and PDD, whereas memory (CAMCOG ), although comparable between DLB and PDD, was, as expected, more impaired in AD. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, hallucinations and cognitive fluctuations were more severe in DLB and PDD than in AD, while UPDRS-III scores, again as expected, were significantly higher in DLB and PDD relative to AD and controls. \n  \nDemographic and group characteristics. \n      \n\n### Cortical thickness \n  \n illustrates the ANCOVA analysis (  n  \u2009=\u2009245), and   summarises the cluster data. Across groups, most of the cerebral cortex showed significant changes in CTh apart from areas of the inferior frontal, pre-post central gyri, paracentral, anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal and medial occipital lobes, where regional CTh was similar. The greatest differences were in the entorhinal cortices.   present the pairwise post hoc results.

As expected, the most affected areas were the entorhinal cortices, parahippocampal gyri, posterior cingulate, lateral temporal and inferior parietal lobules.   details the significant clusters. Controls vs DLB: Cortical thinning was similarly widespread, i.e. in temporal, parietal and frontal lobes ( ). As in AD, areas of greatest change were in the posterior cingulate, lateral temporal and inferior parietal lobules. Entorhinal and parahippocampal changes were also apparent but to a lesser extent than AD.   summarises the cluster data. Controls vs PDD, DLB vs PDD: In PDD, CTh did not differ from healthy controls or participants with DLB ( ). DLB vs AD: Areas of significant thinning were confined only to the bilateral entorhinal cortex and left parahippocampal gyrus in AD compared to DLB. PDD vs AD: CTh was reduced in AD relative to PDD in temporal, frontal and parietal regions ( ). The most affected structures were the entorhinal cortices ( ). \n  \nRegional vertex-wise analyses of cortical thickness (CTh) in controls, AD, DLB and PDD. (a) ANCOVA analysis across groups.

For gCTh, dementia groups were lower than controls (  p  \u2009\u2a7d\u20090.006); PDD was greater than both DLB and AD (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001) but similar between DLB and AD. Percentage wise, the average (left and right hemispheres combined) reduction in gCTh relative to controls was \u22126.4%, \u22125.5% and \u22121.8% for AD, DLB and PDD, respectively. \n\n and   summarise the correlation results in AD, DLB and PDD. Significant effects on CTh were found for CAMCOG  and CAMCOG  in DLB. Lower CAMCOG  scores were associated with a pattern of decreased thickness in the bilateral medial frontal, middle temporal, inferior frontal and inferior parietal as well as right insula, right posterior cingulate, right fusiform and right medial orbitofrontal structures. Lower CAMCOG  scores were associated with a pattern of decreased thickness in the bilateral medial temporal/temporal poles, left inferior parietal, right cingulate, right superior temporal and right superior/orbito frontal regions. Interestingly, there were no significant relationships between CTh and any of the behavioural measures in AD or PDD. \n  \nVertex-wise analyses of cortical thickness (CTh) as a function of CAMCOG  and CAMCOG  in DLB.

A largely similar pattern of regional cortical thinning was apparent between AD and DLB relative to controls apart from a more severe loss within the entorhinal and parahippocampal structures in AD. In PDD, regional CTh was indistinguishable from controls and DLB, implying either a heterogeneous disease group or one with a degree of \u2018intermediate\u2019 cortical change. By averaging the regional values across the cortical surfaces, we derived measures of gCTh in these groups, where DLB, PDD and AD showed significantly lower gCTh than controls; however, PDD was also greater than DLB and AD, suggesting an \u2018intermediary\u2019 level of global cortical change in PDD. In percentage terms, the average reduction in gCTh compared to controls was \u22121.8%, \u22125.5% and \u22126.4% for PDD, DLB and AD, respectively. Cortical thinning was also associated with cognitive decline in DLB but not in PDD or AD. \n\nIn AD, there was a widespread pattern of change in CTh with the lateral temporoparietal and medial temporal areas particularly affected. Cortical thinning in AD has been extensively studied, and our results are consistent with those of previous reports ( ;  ). Relative to controls, a similar picture was associated with DLB, with evidence of some medial temporal thinning but to a lesser extent than AD. When AD and DLB are contrasted, the results suggest a largely shared pattern with the exception of the entorhinal and parahippocampal structures which are more affected in AD. It, therefore, seems that for established AD and DLB with similar levels of global cognition, DLB resembles an AD-like pattern but slightly upstream in terms of cortical thinning. An investigation of prodromal patients found CTh changes relative to controls in AD but not DLB ( ), while longitudinal studies in DLB have shown significantly lower rates of global atrophy compared to AD ( ), with higher rates of atrophy associated with increased concurrent levels of AD co-pathology (\u03b2-amyloid) ( ), which appears to support this view. \n\nCortical degeneration in DLB is heterogeneous and not entirely understood, although a contributory factor may be the presence of coexisting AD-related pathology (\u03b2-amyloid, tau). Positive emission tomography (PET) imaging has shown that around 50\u201360% of people with DLB have significant amyloid deposition ( ), with a high burden predicting a greater rate of cortical atrophy ( ). More recently, tau deposition has been reported in parietal structures in DLB utilising the tau PET tracer  F-AV-1451 ( ;  ). Amyloid-positive DLB cases had marked increases in cortical tau ( F-AV-1451 uptake) ( ), and similarly, others found increased temporoparietal and occipital tau binding correlated with global Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) in DLB ( ). It seems that in DLB, people with a higher amyloid burden have additional cortical tau pathology which may then accelerate or contribute to the neurodegenerative process in DLB. Longitudinal studies utilising molecular imaging techniques (tau and amyloid) may offer insight into the evolutionary interaction of these pathologies and their effects on the clinical features, cortical atrophy and outcomes. \n\nThe pattern of regional cortical thinning associated with PDD was indistinguishable from healthy controls and patients with DLB, indicating either a heterogeneous group or one with \u2018intermediate\u2019 levels of cortical degeneration. In vivo Alzheimer proteinopathies are less common in PDD than in DLB, where studies have shown higher cortical amyloid deposition ( ) and more transitional tau retention in the former (DLB\u2009>\u2009PDD\u2009>\u2009controls) ( ). Pathologically, studies have also reported higher cortical \u03b2-amyloid and tau loads in DLB compared to PDD, which contribute to cortical neurodegeneration ( ). Therefore, less cortical thinning in PDD than in DLB is consistent with this notion. However, significant cortical thinning has been previously reported in people with mild cognitive impairment and dementia in PD relative to controls, in contrast to our results ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Results of structural MRI change have been variable across studies utilising voxelwise, region of interest and CTh measures in PDD. Some report very little change, while others have reported widespread cortical deficits. This may be partly due to the differences in analysis methods. Some reported either uncorrected or Monte Carlo cluster-wise statistics. Cluster-wise approaches provide lower spatial sensitivity and infer a signal somewhere within a cluster. For liberal cluster thresholds, large clusters are often generated where it is then difficult to locate regions representing the true effects, and consequently, the degree of reported change may be overstated. One study that reported vertex-wise FDR-corrected results showed cortical thinning in the frontal, temporal and posterior parietal cortices in PDD (  n  \u2009=\u200915) ( ). Notably, average gCTh in PDD was similar in both studies, CTh (present study) 2.40\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07 and CTh (Zarei et al.) 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05, and was greater than that in DLB, CTh (present study) 2.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05. Variation in results may be partly due to global cognition (MMSE \u2009=\u200921.2, MMSE \u2009=\u200918.3), differences in cohort size and comparison group but also highlights disease heterogeneity in PDD. Longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are needed to accurately assess heterogeneity in PDD. \n\nCortical thinning was associated with cognitive decline in DLB. Memory (CAMCOG ) related to a CTh pattern involving predominantly the temporal lobes and right frontal regions, whereas for global cognition (CAMCOG ), there was also a correlation with parietal and medial frontal areas. We did not detect significant effects between CTh and any of the behavioural measures in either AD or PDD. For AD, the lack of association may be due to floor effects as cortical degeneration occurs much earlier in the disease course. Cholinergic dysfunction is strongly associated with cognitive deficits, fluctuating cognition and visual hallucinations in PDD ( ) and may suggest that strategic loss of key corticopetal afferents from the basal forebrain rather than broad-scale cortical neuronal loss underpins cognitive impairment in this group. Despite similar levels of global cognition, the variation in the pattern and extent of cortical thinning suggests differing mechanisms underlying cognitive decline among AD, DLB and PDD. \n\nStrengths of the study include the following: a large group of probable AD, DLB and PDD patients who were matched for global cognition (MMSE and CAMCOG) and the reporting of FDR-corrected results. While combining datasets has the important advantage of statistical power, one of the disadvantages is in differing assessment procedures. This included the lack of common measures of everyday function and assessment of duration of illness. Duration of illness can be difficult to accurately assess in dementia and, especially, in DLB and PDD where diagnostic delays are common ( ). Other study limitations include the following: diagnoses were clinical rather than neuropathological and there were no measure of tau or amyloid. The effect of using slightly different MRI sequences across the study cohorts did not appear to significantly affect the vertex-wise analyses and, therefore, results but was included as a nuisance covariate for completeness. Further, CTh data from study 2 have been published ( ), while the data from studies 1, 3 and 4 have not. Future work could investigate the patterns of cortical thinning in DLB and PDD, stratified according to high/low amyloid and tau, in order to study the AD pathological burden and their effects on cortical degeneration in Lewy body disease. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur findings suggest a specific profile of cortical thinning across healthy controls, PDD, DLB and AD. The pattern of structural change in DLB was similar to that in AD, to a slightly lesser extent, while PDD appeared to demonstrate an \u2018intermediate\u2019 degree of regional and global cortical thinning. In these samples, effects of CTh on cognition were confined to DLB that may support the notion of differing processes underlying cognition across Lewy body diseases. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7285984, "text_md5": "25976b397ca5f4b60b9ec999a05289f8", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 97], "journal": [98, 119], "publication_year": [121, 125], "title": [136, 213], "keywords": [227, 346], "abstract": [359, 2749], "body": [2758, 23555]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 31696728, "doi": "10.1177/0004867419885165", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7285984", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7285984"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7285984\">7285984</a>", "list_title": "PMC7285984  Cortical thinning in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia"}
