In this process, reward can serve as a reinforcer that shapes internal prediction models, enabling context-appropriate behavior. While the involvement of the cerebellum in reward processing has been established in animals, there is no detailed account of which cerebellar regions are involved in reward anticipation and outcome processing in humans. To this end, an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies was performed to investigate cerebellar functional activity patterns associated with reward anticipation and outcome processing in healthy adults. Results showed that reward anticipation (k\u00a0=\u00a031) was associated with regional activity in the bilateral anterior lobe, bilateral lobule VI, left Crus I and the posterior vermis, while reward outcome (k\u00a0=\u00a016) was associated with regional activity in the declive and left lobule VI. These findings demonstrate distinct involvement of the cerebellum in reward anticipation and outcome processing as part of a predictive coding routine.
