We aimed to determine, via meta-analysis, agreement between the two tests and identify predictors of disagreement. We performed a systematic search for studies comparing WT and fMRI for memory lateralization with individual-patient data. If results were provided as laterality indexes instead of hemispheric lateralization, the cutoff point for memory lateralization was set to the usual \u00b12 for WT and \u00b10.20 for fMRI. We also evaluated results at our Epilepsy Center. Seven published series plus our own were included, comprising 124 patients. Wada test was performed by recognizing objects in half of the studies, and scenes, drawings, and words in the rest. All used scenes or pictures encoding for fMRI. Wada test-fMRI agreement across the studies ranged from 21.1 to 100%, averaging 46.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 37.6-56.0%). When cases with bilateral memory in either test were excluded, agreement reached 78.7% (95% CI: 67.6-89.8%), and concordance with contralateral TLE foci 86.4% for the WT and 83.0% for fMRI. Higher agreement was associated with using multiple items during WT (p\u202f=\u202f0.001) and higher disagreement with presence of a lesion on MRI (p\u202f=\u202f0.024). Binary logistic regression confirmed use of multiple items on WT as the strongest predictor of agreement (odds ratio [OR]: 6.95, 95% CI: 1.84-26.22; p\u202f=\u202f0.004) and a bilateral result on the WT or fMRI of disagreement (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.07-0.89 and OR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03-0.45; p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Concordance between WT and fMRI for memory lateralization is low in patients with TLE and bilateral memoryl memory distribution or a structural etiology, and it improves with encoding of a varied set of items. Both tests can help to lateralize the TLE foci.
