Patients with TS can differ markedly in the frequency, severity, and bodily distribution of tics. Moreover, there are high comorbidity rates with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety disorders, and depression. This complex clinical profile may account for apparent variability of findings across neuroimaging studies that connect neural function to cognitive and motor behavior in TS. \n\nHere we crystalized information from neuroimaging regarding the functional circuitry of TS, and furthermore, tested specifically for neural determinants of tic severity, by applying activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses to neuroimaging (activation) studies of TS. Fourteen task-based studies (13 fMRI and one H2O-PET) met rigorous inclusion criteria. These studies, encompassing 25 experiments and 651 participants, tested for differences between TS participants and healthy controls across cognitive, motor, perceptual and somatosensory domains. \n\nRelative to controls, TS participants showed distributed differences in the activation of prefrontal (inferior, middle, and superior frontal gyri), anterior cingulate, and motor preparation cortices (lateral premotor cortex and supplementary motor area; SMA). Differences also extended into sensory (somatosensory cortex and the lingual gyrus; V4); and temporo-parietal association cortices (posterior superior temporal sulcus, supramarginal gyrus, and retrosplenial cortex). \n\nWithin TS participants, tic severity (reported using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale; YGTSS) selectively correlated with engagement of SMA, precentral gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus across tasks. \n\nThe dispersed involvement of multiple cortical regions with differences in functional reactivity may account for heterogeneity in the symptomatic expression of TS and its comorbidities.

Tics are rapid, recurrent actions or vocalisations that may range in complexity from simple brief acts such as eye blinks or coughs, to elaborate action sequences. Tics are highly variable in their presentation among individuals, with substantial differences in the frequency, complexity, and bodily location of tics. \n\nTics show a number of distinctive features. They often exhibit a classical \u2018waxing and waning\u2019 in severity and presentation over time ( ,  ,  ), and are typically exacerbated by anxiety, stress, and fatigue ( ). Although tics are commonly assumed to be compulsive and \u2018unwilled\u2019, they can be more accurately described as \u2018unvoluntary\u2019, in that an involuntary urge to move can be relieved by a volitional decision to release the tic ( ,  ). These \u2018premonitory\u2019 urges often (though not always) precede tics and occur in up to 90% of adolescents with TS ( ). Such premonitory experiences often take the form of uncomfortable sensory symptoms, and are not only subjectively perceived by patients as a key precursor event in tic expression, but are furthermore associated with greater tic severity, greater functional impairment, and poorer quality of life ( ,  ). \n\nTS is a neurodevelopmental disorder, with onset of tics in childhood or adolescence. However, the lifespan trajectory is highly variable: >\u00a050% of people with TS may experience a substantial decline in tic severity by early adulthood; some may undergo complete remission; and some continue to experience tics into adulthood, sometimes accompanied by an increase in tic severity ( ,  ). \n\nThe heterogeneous presentation of TS is reflected not only in the individual expression of tics, but also in the expression of common comorbidities ( ). Perhaps only 10% of TS patients have \u2018pure\u2019 TS (i.e. tics only) ( ). The majority of TS individuals present with comorbidities, i.e. as \u2018TS\u00a0+\u2019. The two most frequent comorbid conditions are obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), each showing comorbidity rates of 30%\u201350% ( ). Arguably tic disorders, OCD, and ADHD share core behavioral and psychological features. Correspondingly, within the brain, there is overlap in putative neuroanatomical substrates, implicating fronto-striatal network dysfunction ( ). However, distinct phenotypes are likely to arise from particular developmental profiles in (epi-) genetic architecture ( ) that determine divergent clinical expression ( ). Affective symptomatology, including depression and anxiety, is also more common among patients with TS than in the general population ( ,  ). \n\nTS is linked to aberrant functioning of several neurotransmitters, including dopaminergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic systems ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Prescribed pharmacotherapies most commonly target dopaminergic transmission, but are not effective in all individuals at reducing tics ( ), further highlighting the heterogeneity of the condition. \n\nTheoretical and empirical knowledge suggests broadly that TS is underpinned by dysfunction within cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) motor networks ( ,  ,  ,  ). These circuits underpin habitual motor behavior including the transition of goal-directed action selection to compulsive action ( ,  ). Furthermore, disorders with clear CSTC dysfunction incorporating overlapping symptoms with TS such as compulsivity in OCD ( ), or opponent symptoms such as bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease ( ), highlight the relevance of basal ganglia interactions for tics. Additional cortical and subcortical systems are also implicated in the general expression of TS, including regions supporting motor planning and preparation, executive function, somatosensation and perception ( ,  ,  ). \n\nAlthough there are multiple reported functional differences of neural activity in TS, many are not explicitly linked to expression of particular symptoms. For example, in a prepulse inhibition (PPI) paradigm, children and adults with TS show widespread alterations in activity across distributed anatomical areas compared to controls, suggesting non-specific changes in somatosensory gating ( ,  ). In studies examining motor inhibition, of particular relevance to tic suppression, TS patients show functional differences in motor control and motor execution regions ( ,  ), yet it is difficult to determine if these reflect disruption or enhancement of inhibitory control, and may be obfuscated by participants with heterogeneous developmental courses and comorbid ADHD ( ). Finally, abnormal neural activation is reported for TS individuals during simple motor tasks ( ,  ), during mentalization (theory of mind) ( ,  ), and during emotional face perception ( ). However, abnormalities are not consistent: for example, in one study, no differences were observed between adolescents with TS and controls during tests spanning cognitive and motor domains ( ). \n\nTaken together, these findings indicate that functional neuroanatomical differences associated with TS are perhaps subtle, yet extend beyond motor circuitry into neural substrates supporting many domains of cognitive function. Specific functional differences may relate to the core symptoms of tics and premonitory sensations ( ), or reflect facets of common comorbidities ( ), distinct developmental trajectories ( ), or even dysfunction impacting multiple neural systems, such as a tendency towards cortical hyperexcitability ( ). Historically, the assimilation of disparate results from functional neuroimaging studies on TS populations is challenging on account of substantial participant heterogeneity in tic experience, lifespan expression, comorbidity rate, and medication usage ( ). One examination of convergent activations specifically related to tic generation, response inhibition, and voluntary motor execution identified the SMA, cingulate cortex, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex ( ). However, beyond these specific phenomenological aspects of TS, the different functional systems in which there are potential differences between TS and control populations are reflected in the different cognitive tasks applied by functional imaging studies, and in the neuroanatomical distribution of identified functional changes that extend beyond canonical CSTC networks ( ,  ). \n\nIn the current study, we use a meta-analytic approach to synthesize the existing neuroimaging literature of task-based fMRI studies in TS populations. We conducted a series of activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses ( ,  ) to improve statistical power compared to a single study, and capitalize upon evidence from studies with different sample characteristics and experimental designs, to elucidate common neurobiological substrates related to TS. \n\nWe first tested for group differences between TS and control participants in neural activation, across cognitive domains. Next, given the mixed comorbidity samples employed in the literature, we determined which patterns of functional neural reactivity specifically relate to tics (as core TS symptoms), by examining association between neural activations and tic severity score, across the various experimental tasks employed. This combined approach provides an overview of the existing task-based neuroimaging data on TS, and further pinpoints specific functional neuroanatomy alterations that are central to TS, beyond comorbidities. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature search \n  \nA literature search on PubMed ( ) was conducted using the following search terms: \u201cTourette\u201d OR \u201cTourette Syndrome\u201d OR \u201cTourette's Syndrome\u201d AND \u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cPET\u201d OR \u201cpositron emission tomography\u201d. Only studies that met the following inclusion criteria were considered for analysis:   \nOriginal data are presented (thus, review papers were excluded), \n  \nTourette Syndrome sample was examined (excluding studies on patients with secondary tics after e.g. traumatic brain injury, stroke, encephalitis, and patients with Tourette-like symptoms called Tourettisms), \n  \nStudy included a control group and reports TS vs control contrast(s), \n  \nMethods include task-related fMRI or H2O-PET (excluding e.g. diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), voxel-based morphometry (VBM), behavioral only, and non-task-related fMRI studies such as resting-state fMRI), \n  \nParticipants were not subjected to treatment therapies as part of the experimental manipulation (e.g. deep brain stimulation (DBS) or drug infusion; exception: behavioral therapy), \n  \nWhole-brain analysis was conducted (excluding studies reporting only region of interest (ROI) analyses), \n  \nPeak activation coordinates are reported, \n  \nStudy was conducted with human participants, \n  \nArticle was originally published in English. \n  \n\n provides a detailed illustration of the literature selection process.   \nFlow chart describing the literature selection process. Number of publications (n) and number of individuals (N) are indicated. *We tested all combinations of search terms \u201cTourette\u201d, \u201cTourette Syndrome\u201d, \u201cTourette's Syndrome\u201d AND \u201cfMRI\u201d, \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cPET\u201d, \u201cpositron emission tomography\u201d. Searches other than those indicated in the figure did not provide additional results. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n### Study selection \n  \nAs of January 2017, fourteen publications met inclusion criteria for the first ALE analysis examining differences between TS and control participants (see Supplementary Table 1 for references). If otherwise suitable studies did not report activation coordinates, we contacted the authors by e-mail. However, all enquiries remained unsuccessful. Likewise, we contacted the authors of three papers who did not report the age range of the participants ( ,  ,  ) to request these. This information was available for one study ( ). The age of the participants from the other two studies ( ,  ) is therefore described with the mean and standard deviation, as reported within the original publications. The following information was recorded for each study: first author and year of publication, neuroimaging method (fMRI/H2O-PET), task domain, brief task description and contrast(s) entered to the ALE, sample size of TS and control groups, age range of TS participants (in all studies, case and control participants were age-matched), number of TS participants with comorbid OCD and ADHD, and their medication status ( ). Notably, if two studies presented different data acquired from the same sample, both were included as separate experiments ( ,  ).   \nStudies included in the ALE meta-analysis examining differences in activations between TS participants and controls. \n  Table 1       \n\nTwo studies ( ,  ) found no difference between the TS and control groups and were thus entered into the meta-analysis with no coordinates. Three other studies ( ,  ,  ) conducted an ANOVA analysis, and we selected information equivalent to the TS vs control contrast from reported main effects and interactions. Interactions were only used if the direction of the effect was clearly described, and relevant to group differences. For example, in a study of prepulse inhibition in TS and control participants, a reported Task\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Group interaction reflected activation differences between TS and control groups for the contrast of PPI trials compared to \u2018pulse alone\u2019 trials ( ). In addition, some articles provided more than one analysis comparing TS and control participants. For example, in a study of finger tapping, TS and control participants were compared on finger tapping with the right hand in one analysis, and on finger tapping with the left hand in another ( ). These contrasts were included in the meta-analysis as separate experiments. Contrasts examining decreases [TS\u00a0<\u00a0control] and increases [TS\u00a0>\u00a0control] in activation for the TS group were pooled and included in one experiment as [TS vs control]. The final selection of publications provided 25 experiments, 311 foci, and a total of 651 participants. \n\n\n### ALE meta-analysis: TS vs controls group difference \n  \nFirst, we examined differences in activations between TS participants and controls. The meta-analysis was performed using GingerALE 2.3.6. ( ). The activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm treats the reported foci of included studies as spatial probability distributions centered on the given coordinates ( ,  ). The width of the distribution depends on empirical estimates of between-subject and between-template variability, also accounting for the sample size of each experiment. Further, a \u2018modelled activation\u2019 (MA) map is computed by merging the probability distributions of all foci reported in the respective experiment. The ALE image is then produced by taking the union of all MA maps in a voxel-wise manner. The algorithm subsequently searches for above-chance convergence of activation probabilities between experiments. This allows for a random-effect analysis, as opposed to considering between-foci convergence that would produce a fixed-effects analysis, thereby permitting generalization of the results to experiments not included in the meta-analysis. Finally, the results are tested against a null distribution that assumes random spatial association between experiments. Our approach therefore followed the details of established ALE methodology ( ). \n\nStereotactic brain coordinates reported in Talairach space were converted to MNI using Talairach to MNI (SPM) conversion as implemented in GingerALE. Default settings were used with the exception of setting the ALE Method to \u201cTurkeltaub Non-Additive\u201d, which controls within-experiment effects by limiting probability values of neighboring foci from the same experiment. This is achieved using the maximum probability associated with a given focus (as opposed to using the union of the probabilities) for computing the MA map ( ). The ALE map was thresholded at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected with a minimum cluster volume of 100\u00a0mm  ( ,  ). The ALE map was displayed using MRIcron ( ), and anatomical labeling was guided by the Anatomy toolbox 2.2b ( ) for SPM12 ( ,  ), and the Harvard-Oxford Cortical Structural Atlas ( ) in FSL ( ). \n\n#### TS vs controls group difference: additional task-based studies employing region of interest (ROI) approaches \n  \nFour studies that otherwise met inclusion criteria employed an ROI analysis method whereby the whole-brain effect of task, for both TS and control participants, was used to define a \u2018task ROI\u2019 to which a small volume correction was applied when interrogating the group difference between TS and control participants. These four studies therefore did not meet our strict inclusion criteria in that they do not perform a whole-brain analysis when comparing the TS group to controls. However, we acknowledge the contribution of these studies to the published literature on TS. We therefore conducted an exploratory ALE meta-analysis that incorporated these additional four studies, including contrasts that examined the group difference within task ROIs. These additional four studies are detailed in Supplementary Table 2 and references listed in Supplementary Table 3. All ALE procedures were the same as for the primary group difference analysis (above). The results did not substantially change the clusters in the resulting ALE map (Supplementary Table 5) and therefore will not be further discussed. \n\n\n\n### ALE meta-analysis: tic severity \n  \nWe next examined the relationship between activations and tic severity in TS. We conducted a second ALE meta-analysis on neuroimaging studies that reported activation coordinates for correlations with tic severity in TS participants. Suitable studies were identified using the aforementioned inclusion criteria (see  ). We discarded all criteria regarding the control group, as they bare no relevance to symptom severity analyses. As a result, 7 fMRI publications ( ) met inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis, one of which ( ) found no correlation with symptom severity, and was thus used with no coordinates. Together, these articles provided information about 8 experiments with 23 foci and 378 participants. All studies measured tic severity with the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). The reference list of the publications included in this tic severity meta-analysis can be found in Supplementary Table 4. ALE procedures were the same as for the group difference analysis ( ).   \nStudies included in the meta-analysis examining correlations with tic severity in TS.

Fourteen activation clusters were identified in the resulting ALE image ( ). TS participants showed differences in activations in lateral prefrontal cortex, including the inferior, middle, and superior frontal gyri; anterior cingulate cortex; lateral premotor cortex (precentral gyrus); supplementary motor area (SMA); posterior superior temporal sulcus; the supramarginal gyrus; retrosplenial cortex; secondary somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus); and the lingual gyrus.

Furthermore, we tested for task activation patterns that specifically relate to core TS symptoms, by examining correlations with tic severity within TS patients. Group differences were identified in functional systems including prefrontal and motor preparation areas; sensory-perceptual (somatosensory and visual) areas; and parieto-temporal association cortices. Importantly, however, only prefrontal and motor preparation regions predicted tic severity, suggesting specificity of task-based neural reactivity within these areas to the core symptomatology of TS. \n\nThese results support a core dysfunction of CSTC motor loops in TS that specifically underpins the expression of tics ( ,  ,  ). Moreover, more generalized CSTC dysfunction may account for alterations across neuroanatomical systems predisposing individuals to the heterogeneity of intrinsic symptoms and the multifaceted nature of neuropsychiatric vulnerabilities within the TS spectrum ( ,  ). \n\n### Anatomically widespread alterations in neural function in TS \n  \nThe neuroimaging studies of TS included in the meta-analyses were task-based studies that represented multiple experimental paradigms across cognitive domains. These included motor execution tasks, for example finger tapping ( ,  ,  ,  ), motor inhibition tasks, for example the stop signal and Go/No-Go tasks ( ,  ), executive function challenges, for example the Stroop task ( ,  ), probes of somatosensory gating, for example the prepulse (PPI) inhibition paradigm ( ,  ), theory of mind tasks ( ,  ), and responses to emotional faces ( ). These neuroimaging investigations highlight the diversity of cognitive processes that are putatively altered in TS, which our first meta-analysis demonstrates are correspondingly reflected in differences in neural function, distributed anatomically across multiple neural systems. \n\nTics are fundamentally motor symptoms, and several motor execution and inhibition studies were included in the meta-analysis. We therefore anticipated that evidence for motor circuit dysfunction would be identified: specifically, the meta-analysis highlighted cortical dysregulation within the motor preparation regions SMA and premotor cortex. We discuss the implications for understanding the dysfunction of these regions in reference to the tic severity ALE analysis in  . \n\nThe analysis of group differences also highlighted prefrontal clusters, encompassing all three frontal gyri. A high proportion of the included studies tested patients with comorbid ADHD and/or OCD, in which prefrontal dysfunction and associated executive deficits are likely core elements ( ,  ,  ). Thus, these prefrontal clusters may in part reflect the presence of, or predisposition to, these comorbid conditions in TS individuals. \n\nSomatosensory features are important elements to the general experience of TS. Premonitory sensations frequently precede tics ( ,  ). These are often described as feelings of \u2018itch\u2019 or \u2018pressure\u2019, and typically show a somato-homuncular coupling to the bodily location at which the tic subsequently emerges ( ). Our meta-analysis confirmed differences in the functional reactivity of somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus) in TS compared to controls, indicating how somatomotor control through cortico-cortical interaction might underpin the experiential expression of TS. \n\nHowever, it is notable that the insula was not identified. Although the task-based studies included in our analysis did not explicitly test the neurobiological mechanisms of premonitory phenomena, the insula has been proposed as a core site of sensory symptom generation ( ,  ,  ), and structural neuroimaging has confirmed severity of premonitory phenomena is associated with both somatosensory and insular cortices ( ,  ). It is possible that while the insula is indeed a likely generator of sensory symptoms, it was not detected in our meta-analyses because task-based studies of TS to date have not typically employed paradigms testing bodily processing that are likely to activate the insula, such as interoceptive tasks ( ). Regardless of task nature, however, it would be useful if future task-based fMRI studies reported sensory symptom severity associations, as many studies in the existing literature do for tic severity, so that future meta-analyses can confirm if functional reactivity of the insula, alongside somatosensory cortex, are associated with this dimension of TS symptom expression. Of note, one resting-state fMRI study has already indicated that strength of insula interactions with SMA is associated with premonitory phenomena severity ( ). \n\nSensorimotor coupling and the priming of motor responses by sensation extends beyond proprioception and touch. Although the processing and representation of visual information has rarely been studied in TS, several visual processes appear to operate differently. Visual field ( ) and colour vision ( ) deficits are both described in TS. Interestingly, the group difference analysis identified a cluster within lingual gyrus in the region of the colour perception area, V4. In addition, there are indications that perception of complex visual stimuli, namely facial expressions, is altered in TS. Participants with TS may show greater amygdala activation to emotional faces ( ), a possible driver for echopraxic facial tics, which more generally, highlights the influence of salient environmental stimuli on the sensitivity of people with TS to potential stressors ( ), including social emotional cues. Furthermore, a tendency for people with TS to engage in mental state reasoning, even when not explicitly required, may also promote greater neural reactivity in response to social and emotional cues ( ). While our meta-analysis cannot explicitly test for such mechanisms, group differences were observed across temporo-parietal areas implicated in own bodily self-consciousness, perception of others, and perspective taking; these included the posterior superior temporal sulcus, the supramarginal gyrus, and retrosplenial cortex ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nOur first analysis demonstrated the presence of differences in cortical reactivity in TS, distributed across anatomically widespread neural systems. These differences may account for the wider set of cognitive, affective, and behavioral symptoms of the TS spectrum. Moreover it remains plausible that, in TS, a common process affecting cortical reactivity (e.g. compromised CSTC control) underpins these observations, with variable expression beyond the critical impact on tics. We therefore focused next on patterns of brain reactivity that might underpin the specific experience of tics in TS. \n\n\n### Tic severity is specifically associated with prefrontal and premotor activity \n  \nRegardless of comorbidities, developmental stage, or medication status, one symptom that all individuals with TS have in common is the expression of tics. We therefore performed an ALE meta-analysis to determine which regions show a specific relationship between task activity and tic severity. A subset of premotor and prefrontal regions, encompassing the supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, and middle frontal gyrus were identified, indicating that the greater participants' tic severity, the greater the functional alterations in these regions. This corroborates the role of the supplementary motor area and premotor cortex in CSTC circuit dysfunction in TS ( ,  ,  ,  ). In addition, these data demonstrate the close relationship between prefrontal cortex function and tic expression, which may relate to inhibitory tic suppression strategies ( ), and influence the degree of plasticity in adaptive prefrontal regulation of motor responses ( ,  ). The importance of SMA and prefrontal cortex for tic generation, tic suppression, and voluntary action was highlighted by   in an examination of activation clusters related to these particular phenomenological aspects of TS. \n\nInterestingly, we did not observe any clusters within subcortical regions within this meta-analysis. Basal ganglia nuclei clearly play a role in tic expression ( ,  ) and are altered in structural morphology ( ,  ). The thalamus also has a critical role within CSTC circuitry ( ), and is a therapeutic target for deep brain stimulation ( ). In addition, there is evidence for TS-related structural and functional differences of the amygdala ( ,  ). That these subcortical structures were not identified in either the group difference or tic severity ALE analyses may reflect methodological insensitivity and the focus on task-based activation studies. Firstly, the particular subtractions used in these task-based studies may be less sensitive towards subcortical responses in whole-brain analyses. Secondly, although several studies employed paradigms relating to motor function, such as finger tapping, they did not examine symptom expression per se, other than broad correlations with tic severity. Thirdly, neurovascular coupling and the BOLD response differ in cortical and subcortical brain areas, with the result that neuroimaging studies may be more sensitive to group differences in cortical areas in general ( ,  ). Finally, the ALE methodology itself employs assumptions which may diminish the sensitivity of the analysis to detect results in subcortical regions (see   below). \n\n\n### ALE limitations \n  \nIn establishing the pool of appropriate studies from the current TS neuroimaging literature for meta-analysis inclusion, a number of issues became apparent that have implications for the interpretation of our ALE results. We applied stringent selection criteria, requiring all studies to have conducted whole-brain analyses, report peak co-ordinates, and employed both a TS and a control group. Despite the burgeoning number of task-based neuroimaging investigations of TS, unfortunately, many did not meet these basic criteria: most often, authors had not reported whole-brain investigations, and instead reported only group differences within pre-selected ROIs, negating the opportunity for the data to contribute to a meta-analysis, as this would a priori bias probability distributions produced by GingerALE towards the ROI foci. \n\nThis has two important implications. Firstly, our results do not encompass the entirety of available literature. Secondly, there appears to be a methodological tendency in a portion of task-based investigations of TS to examine specific regions-of-interest assumed to be of relevance for TS, or known to be important for the task. This contrasts with the use of whole-brain analyses that report which regions reach criterion threshold. The impact on meta-analytic investigations is that if non-significant whole-brain results are not reported, we are unable to enter that study to ALE analysis with zero co-ordinates. Thus, the group differences that we identify may be inflated. Therefore, even when ROIs are selected in clear relevance to the participant group and paradigms employed, we suggest it is helpful for future interpretation, and the pursuit of meta-analytic insights, that authors consistently report whole-brain statistical tests \u2013 even if non-significant \u2013 alongside ROI data. \n\nThe fact that (significant) whole-brain analyses are not more frequently reported may also reflect the subtle nature of differences in brain function in the neurodevelopmental disorder TS, when compared to neurodegenerative disorders (such as Parkinson's disease,  ). Indeed, beyond task-based fMRI investigations ( ,  ,  ), neuroimaging studies of TS have not always revealed significant differences, including voxel-based morphology (VBM) studies of brain morphology ( ,  ,  ); PET studies of striatal dopamine binding potential ( ,  ), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies of GABA concentration ( ). This inconsistency in findings may be partly explained by heterogeneity of TS samples, including differences in sample size and variability in patient characteristics, in addition to differences in MRI hardware and methodology ( ). \n\nThe application of meta-analyses can provide powerful overviews of disparate literature. However, to draw robust conclusions, the extent of contributing literature matters. For task-based fMRI data analysed with GingerALE, in general, a sample size of approximately 20 studies is likely to yield sufficient power for moderate effects ( ). In our sample size of 14 studies, we identified multiple clusters of differences and effects in TS. However, these did not reach significance at the most conservative thresholds for multiple comparisons correction. We therefore present our results with a degree of caution. Nevertheless, we identified an additional 7 studies that did not meet our stringent inclusion criterion for whole-brain analyses, and a further 6 studies that did not report activation coordinates. To test the impact of some of these otherwise eligible studies, we performed an additional exploratory analysis in which we included four task-ROI studies. Importantly, however, our results were not substantially different. Greater power and interpretive insight than was possible at present will benefit from future reporting of neuroimaging results within the TS literature at whole-brain thresholds, alongside more detailed reporting of clinical severity associations such as premonitory phenomena. \n\n\n### Future directions \n  \nFuture neuroimaging studies should carefully consider the complex presentation of TS, as the large proportion of individuals with comorbid disorders ( ) may bias comparisons to unaffected participants ( ,  ). The direct comparison of \u2018pure\u2019 TS patients, TS participants with comorbidities, and control participants, will be of particular value, yet requires sufficient sample sizes. Medication status is another important aspect which should similarly be dealt with, by comparisons between medicated and medication-free patients, given that medication can modulate cognitive function and behavior ( ). Even in the case of smaller, mixed samples, the accurate reporting of the presence and severity of comorbidities will refine interpretation across the imaging literature. \n\nAn increased interest in resting-state fMRI studies of TS is apparent, as is evident in publications from 2014 to 2015 ( ). However, our examination of the current fMRI literature on TS highlights the need for further task-related fMRI, reporting whole-brain results, to provide unique data on evoked neural reactivity that can complement and inform the interpretation of resting-state functional connectivity datasets. The constrained use of ROI analysis can be valuable for testing specific hypotheses regarding putative neural mechanisms, yet the approach can lead to an overrepresentation of selected brain regions within the literature, and underrepresentation of others ( ). This circumvents the ideal application of meta-analytic approaches, since ROI studies introduce a priori increases in the likelihood of identified foci. Finally, network analysis methods, such as dynamic causal modeling (DCM) ( ), permit greater insight into mechanistic pathways of dysfunction beyond increases or decreases in regional activity. These approaches hold the potential for unveiling network integration changes, even if no activation differences are found within individual nodes of the network ( ,  ). Thus, even if only subtle univariate results are observed, it is possible to reveal disorder-specific effects. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nUsing GingerALE meta-analysis, we found differences in neural activity in TS across multiple regions of neocortex, encompassing motor, somatosensory, and perceptual systems. However, only premotor and prefrontal areas were specific to the core expression of tics in TS. This accords with models of CSTC circuit dysfunction as fundamentally underpinning aspects of TS. The heterogeneity of TS, and methodological limitations within the existing task-based neuroimaging literature, invite future investigations to carefully delineate their sample populations and analysis reports. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5554925, "text_md5": "1fbd5ea93ccc72342bb3006019686809", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 63], "journal": [64, 79], "publication_year": [81, 85], "title": [96, 233], "keywords": [247, 367], "abstract": [380, 2829], "body": [2838, 38816]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 28831377, "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2017.08.004", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554925", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5554925"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554925\">5554925</a>", "list_title": "PMC5554925  Centrality of prefrontal and motor preparation cortices to Tourette Syndrome revealed by meta-analysis of task-based neuroimaging studies"}
