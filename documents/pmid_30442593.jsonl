Using the Activation Likelihood Estimation method, we therefore conducted such a meta-analysis on 9 studies, representing 27 neuroimaging contrasts and 131 participants. We identified a network composed of brain areas underlying the cognitive abilities required for driving: sensorimotor coordination, sensory and attentional processing, high-level cognitive control and allocation of attentional resources. We complemented this meta-analysis with a neuroergonomics approach combining driving control knowledge, distinguishing the strategical, tactical and operational levels, with neuroscientific knowledge and models on cognitive control operated by the prefrontal cortex. The results exposed the distinct neural circuits engaged behind the wheel depending on the task performed. Based on the combination of neuroscientific and ergonomic knowledge, a hybrid car driving framework is also proposed.
