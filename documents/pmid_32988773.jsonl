The present review and meta-analysis provide an update of the location of the abnormalities in the fMRI-measured brain response to cognitive processes in individuals with FEP. Systematic review and voxel-based meta-analysis of cross-sectional fMRI studies comparing neural responses to cognitive tasks between individuals with FEP and healthy controls (HC) according to PRISMA guidelines. Twenty-six studies were included, comprising 598 individuals with FEP and 567 HC. Individual studies reported statistically significant hypoactivation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (6 studies), frontal lobe (8 studies), cingulate (6 studies) and insula (5 studies). The meta-analysis showed statistically significant hypoactivation in the left anterior insula, precuneus and bilateral striatum. While the studies tend to highlight frontal hypoactivation during cognitive tasks in FEP, our meta-analytic results show that the left precuneus and insula primarily display aberrant activation in FEP that may be associated with salience attribution to external stimuli and related to deficits in perception and regulation.
