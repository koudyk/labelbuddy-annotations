The combination of non-invasive brain imaging and generative network models has provided support for hierarchical frontotemporal interactions in oddball tasks, including recent identification of a temporal expectancy signal acting on prefrontal cortex. However, these studies are limited by the need to invert magnetoencephalographic or electroencephalographic sensor signals to localise activity from cortical \u2018nodes\u2019 in the network, or to infer neural responses from indirect measures such as the fMRI BOLD signal. To overcome this limitation, we examined frontotemporal interactions estimated from direct cortical recordings from two human participants with cortical electrode grids (electrocorticography \u2013 ECoG). Their frontotemporal network dynamics were compared to those identified by magnetoencephalography (MEG) in forty healthy adults. All participants performed the same auditory oddball task with standard tones interspersed with five deviant tone types. We normalised post-operative electrode locations to standardised anatomic space, to compare across modalities, and inverted the MEG to cortical sources using the estimated lead field from subject-specific head models. A mismatch negativity signal in frontal and temporal cortex was identified in all subjects. Generative models of the electrocorticographic and magnetoencephalographic data were separately compared using the free-energy estimate of the model evidence. Model comparison confirmed the same critical features of hierarchical frontotemporal networks in each patient as in the group-wise MEG analysis. These features included bilateral, feedforward and feedback frontotemporal modulated connectivity, in addition to an asymmetric expectancy driving input on left frontal cortex. The invasive ECoG provides an important step in construct validation of the use of neural generative models of MEG, which in turn enables generalisation to larger populations. Together, they give convergent evidence for the hierarchical interactions in frontotemporal networks for expectation and processing of sensory inputs. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe brain is proposed to efficiently process information from the world around us through optimising the feedback of predictions of sensory inputs and the feedforward signalling of prediction errors, in hierarchical information processing networks ( ). Under this hypothesis, top-down predictions are compared to bottom-up sensory information and return a prediction error to update the prediction model when a mismatch occurs ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The information processing hierarchy may have multiple levels, with increasing abstraction of information and representation of complex arbitrary features ( ,  ). To test this hypothesis, many studies have used auditory oddball paradigms which evoke a robust error signal in terms of the mismatch negativity response (MMN) to unexpected deviant stimuli that violate a learned regularity of standard stimuli ( ,  ,  ). \n\nEvidence for the direction of influence in frontotemporal interactions underlying auditory prediction came initially from reduced MMN responses in patients with frontal cortical lesions ( ). Evidence from generative models of electrophysiological responses in healthy humans also provides compelling support for hierarchical feedback and feedforward interactions, with prediction and error signals respectively, in frontotemporal connectivity ( ) and phase synchronisation ( ). We recently demonstrated the presence of high-order expectancy inputs driving the frontal cortex ( ) using an oddball task that alternated standard tones with deviants differing from the standard in one of five dimensions. In keeping with previous work ( ,  ,  ) we confirmed that frontotemporal connections were common to all deviant dimensions. Additionally, the frontal cortex was subject to an expectancy or pacemaker input, which was violated by temporal irregularities (duration and silent gap deviants) but not frequency, loudness or laterality. This provides a potential mechanism to explain MMN responses to unexpected absent stimuli (H. C.  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nTo study these networks in humans, it has been necessary to invert generative models of neural interactions to fit the magneto-/electro-encephalography signal ( ,  ,  ). This inversion can in principle be performed simultaneously with the optimisation of neural interactions in the model, using dynamic causal modelling (DCM,  ). This combines the neural network optimisation and inversion of the estimated lead field, using neural mass models and mean field approximations. An important step in validation of DCM would be direct rather than indirect estimation of local field potentials generated by local neuronal ensembles. For example,   provided face validation of the DCM method for functional magnetic resonance imaging, by comparing model parameters derived from fMRI to intracranial recordings of a known model of epileptic spiking and wave discharges in rats. Recently,   provided construct validation of steady-state DCM using simultaneous EEG and ECoG monkey recordings during wakefulness and sedation, finding the same winning models across imaging modalities. \n\nWe sought to provide construct validation of human magnetoencephalography (MEG) method for DCM using human electrocorticography (ECoG), which is sensitive to local field potentials. ECoG of frontal and temporal cortex in left or right hemisphere was undertaken in two patients undergoing pre-surgical assessment for intractable epilepsy. We used the same task and homologous generative model sets as for the analysis of MEG data from forty healthy adults ( ). The patient data enabled the comparison of generative models of hierarchical frontotemporal interactions without the need for inversion of the lead field inherent in MEG. Special procedures were required to normalise the patient data to standard anatomical space to enable fair comparison between methods, given the gross distortion of macroscopic anatomy following craniectomy. \n\nWe predicted the identification of homologous networks across modalities, in terms of the principal features of hierarchical frontotemporal networks for sensory processing. Such homology would provide convergent evidence for the hierarchical interactions of frontotemporal networks in the MMN and an important construct validation of DCM methods. \n\n\n## Material and methods \n  \n### Patients, surgery and intracranial recordings \n  \nPatients were selected for this study if their electrodes were located at two or more regions in the same hemisphere that have been associated with the MMN cortical sources in previous EEG and MEG studies: adjacent to primary auditory cortex (immediately superficial to A1 for surface electrodes); superior temporal gyrus (STG) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) ( ,  ,  ,  ). Two adult patients met these criteria (female aged 20 and male aged 30, both right-handed). Both patients had drug-resistant epilepsy and were undergoing electrode implantation to localise epileptic foci and determine surrounding neural function prior to surgical resection. Electrode locations were determined by clinical criteria. Electrode grids and strips were comprised of platinum electrodes embedded in a 0.5\u00a0mm flexible silicon plate with 3\u00a0mm diameter contact area and 10\u00a0mm inter-electrode distance (AdTech, WI, USA). \n\nPatient L1 was implanted with a 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08 subdural electrode grid over the left hemisphere, extending over superior temporal cortex, covering prefrontal, motor and somatosensory cortex plus inferior parietal lobe. Patient R2 was implanted with subdural electrode grids and strips in the right hemisphere, including: 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08 electrode grid covering prefrontal, motor and somatosensory cortex, and the posterior STG\u00a0and two adjacent 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 electrode strips covering the temporal-parietal junction, posterior temporal pole, occipital pole and inferior parietal lobe. Electrode locations for both patients are shown in  . \n\nPost-implantation structural MRI (Philips Achieva 1.5T, FFE sequence, TR\u00a0=\u00a015\u00a0msec, TE\u00a0=\u00a05.214\u00a0msec, field-of-view 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256 for L1, 240\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240 for R2, 1\u00a0mm slice thickness) and CT images (Siemens Emotion 16, .47\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.47\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.6\u00a0mm voxels, field-of-view 512\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0512) were acquired two-four days after implantation. Task related local field potentials were recorded four days after implantation using the ECoG\u00a0electrode grids and strips. Patients gave written informed consent before testing and the study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Ramos Mej\u00eda Hospital. \n\n\n### Task \n  \nThe task used in both MEG and ECoG has been described in detail previously ( ,  ,  ). It is a time-efficient variant of the classic oddball task, in which standard tones alternate with deviant tones that deviate from the standard in one of five dimensions while holding other stimulus properties constant. This evokes MMN responses comparable to those seen in classic oddball tasks ( ). In brief, standard tones were presented binaurally with 75\u00a0msec duration (including a 7\u00a0msec ramp up and ramp down), and contained three sinusoidal partials of 500, 100 and 1500\u00a0Hz. The deviant tones differed in one of the following: Frequency (550, 1100, 1650\u00a0Hz or 450, 900, 1350\u00a0Hz), intensity (\u00b16\u00a0dB), location of sound source (right or left instead of binaural), shortened duration (25\u00a0msec) or a silent gap in the middle 25\u00a0msec. The task was presented using E-Prime  software (Psychology Software Tools, Inc, USA) via plastic tubes and earpieces and participant's hearing was checked before the task to assure tones were clearly audible. \n\nDeviant tones were presented in a pseudo-random order such that a deviant type never appeared twice in a row and each deviant type would appear at least once in a sequence of ten tones. Tones were presented every 500\u00a0msec, in three blocks of five minutes. Fifteen standard tones were played at the beginning of each block and excluded from further analysis. In total, 900 standard and 900 deviant tones were then played over the three blocks. Therefore, the task includes many events in a finite study period, providing the potential advantages of efficiency in clinical populations as well as generalisation of inferences over multiple types of deviant. \n\n\n### Intracranial data collection, pre-processing and ERP analysis \n  \nECoG local field potentials for patient L1 were recorded using Harmonie 5.2 software (Stellate Systems Inc., Canada) with a 64-channel amplifier Bioscience EEG64 (Bioscience SRL, Argentina) sampled at 200\u00a0Hz. Patient R2's data were recorded on a Blackrock Cervello Elite system (Blackrock NeuroMed, LLC, USA), sampled at 2000\u00a0Hz and downsampled to 250\u00a0Hz. Both patients' data were filtered between 1 and 40\u00a0Hz using high and low-pass Butterworth filters in forward and reverse directions to obtain zero-phase distortion. We extracted \u2212100 to +400\u00a0msec epochs around stimulus tone onset and baseline corrected to the \u2212100 to 0\u00a0msec period. Electrodes were rejected if they covered the clinically identified epileptic foci or were observed to contain high epileptic activity. We also used automatic analysis of trials data and rejected any epoch outside of a three standard deviation from the mean threshold (including many but not necessarily all epileptic spikes). Finally, we used visual inspection to remove any residual trials that contained epileptic spiking. Standard and deviant time-courses were compared for each electrode using a two-sample   t  -test with temporal cluster correction of 25\u00a0msec. \n\n\n### ECoG electrode localisation \n  \nWe sought to use the same MMN sources in standardised MNI space to directly compare effective connectivity measures across modalities. ECoG electrodes were localised using patient CT images, which were normalised to standard space as described by  . Briefly, we co-registered patient post-implantation T1-MRI and CT images using SPM8 software (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL), segmented the T1-MRI pial surface using freesurfer ( ,  ,  ,  ) and used this segmentation to normalise the T1-MRI in SPM8. The normalisation transformation was used to normalise the CT image to MNI space. We used an in-skull mask and thresholded the CT image to just include voxel clusters corresponding to each electrode. The voxel clusters were grouped using k-means clustering and we took the mean centre of each cluster as the coordinate for each electrode ( ). This electrode localisation procedure is available as an open-source toolbox ( ). \n\nOnce the ECoG electrode locations were in standardised space, it was necessary to select a single electrode from the region of interest, to be used in the connectivity analysis and to guide the specification of homologous coordinates in the MEG analysis. To identify the specific electrodes, we first selected a subset of electrodes residing in STG or IFG according to the gross anatomy ( ,  ,  ,  ). Within each subset, we calculated the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between 150 and 250\u00a0msec for each electrode. This CNR was calculated from the pooled signal-to-noise ratio for standard and deviant conditions, as shown: Where   \u03bc   is the mean voltage for each condition,   \u03c3   is the standard deviation and   n   is the number of trials ( ). The electrodes with highest CNR in each region were used in the ECoG connectivity analysis and their coordinates were used as sources for the MEG connectivity analysis. \n\n\n### MEG participants \n  \nForty young healthy MEG participants completed the task (23 males, mean age 33.7, range 21\u201341, 4 left-handed) as part of the population-based sample collected by the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN,  ). Full protocols and exclusion criteria for this cohort are described by  . Participants gave written informed consent and ethical approval for the Cam-CAN study was obtained from the Cambridgeshire 2 Research Ethics Committee. \n\n\n### MEG data acquisition and pre-processing \n  \nMEG data were collected using a 306-channel Vectorview system in a magnetically shielded room (ElektaNeuromag, Helsinki, Finland), including a magnetometer and two orthogonal planar gradiometers at each of the 102 positions. Five Head-Position Indicator (HPI) coils monitored head position plus paired EOG electrodes recorded vertical and horizontal eye movements. The three-dimensional locations of the coils and three anatomical fiducials (nasion and left and right pre-auricular points) were recorded using a 3D digitiser (Fastrak Polhemus Inc, Colchester, VA). Movement compensation and downsampling from 1\u00a0kHz to 250\u00a0Hz was completed using Maxfilter software (Elekta Neuromag). The remaining pre-processing steps were completed using SPM8 software (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL). This included high-pass filtering at 1\u00a0Hz and low-pass filtering at 40\u00a0Hz using Butterworth filters in forward and reverse directions, and epoching \u2212100 to 400\u00a0msec around each tone onset with baseline correction of the \u2212100 to 0\u00a0msec period. We used automatic artefact rejection through thresholding of EOG electrodes at 200\u00a0\u03bcV. Trials were averaged using robust averaging ( ) followed by an additional low-pass filter at 40\u00a0Hz to remove high frequency noise that can be introduced by robust averaging. \n\n\n### MEG source space analysis \n  \nThe sources of MMN responses (difference between standard and deviant trials) were reconstructed using the gradiometer data in SPM8. The forward leadfield model was estimated using a realistic single-shell head model, which was constructed from participant's individual structural MRI scan (T1-weighted, 3D MPRAGE sequence, TR\u00a0=\u00a02250\u00a0msec, TE\u00a0=\u00a02.99\u00a0msec, flip angle 9\u00b0, field-of-view 240\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0160, 1\u00a0mm slice thickness, collected on a 3T Siemens Tim Trio scanner, normalised to MNI space). The head model was co-registered to digitised fiducial markers and >60 scalp loci. The inverse source reconstruction was computed using the multiple sparse priors algorithm (MSP, Greedy Search;  ) for the characteristic MMN time window of 150\u2013250\u00a0msec after tone onset. The resulting source images were smoothed using an 8\u00a0mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. We identified significant sources of the MMN response using a one-sample   t  -test, comparing the MMN to zero mean (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.01, family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons). \n\nAdditionally, we estimated the equivalent current dipoles in bilateral primary A1 (  MNI coordinates: [\u221242, \u221222, 7], [46, \u221214, 8]), the STG and the IFG (coordinates extracted from the ECoG datasets). These coordinates were used as informed priors to fix the dipole locations to these six sources. Dipole orientations and amplitudes were set with flat priors allowing them to be fitted to the data using the variational Bayes method of SPM8 ( ). \n\n\n### Network modelling \n  \nWe used DCM to examine the hierarchical interactions in frontotemporal networks during the MMN task, with both ECoG and MEG data. DCM uses biophysically constrained neural mass models ( ,  ,  ) to make inferences about the mechanisms behind observations of evoked electro- and magneto-encephalographic responses, in terms of the coupling between equivalent current dipole or local field potentials sources and how this coupling is changed by experimental stimuli. \n\nWe first repeated the methods of   to test the reliability of the findings with this larger MEG cohort and successfully reproduced their findings. This full model set could not be replicated in the ECoG dataset due to the limited electrode coverage, thus we were constrained to a sub-space of unilateral two-node models. We therefore inverted twelve generative models, representing alternative hypotheses behind frontotemporal MMN connections, as shown in  . Based on previous studies ( ,  ), these models assessed the inclusion of forward and backward connections between MMN sources in the STG\u00a0and IFG, and the modulation of these connections by the stimuli (models 1\u20136). Following this, models 7\u201312 included top-down internally-generated predictions acting on the frontal source, which we showed to be important for temporal expectations ( ). These models were based on anatomically motivated networks ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and previous MMN studies using DCM ( ,  ). The data were modelled across the post-stimulus period of 0\u2013250\u00a0msec, for each patient using the biophysically constrained local field potential model. All deviant types were used together to maximise the number of deviant trials in the single subject analyses. \n\nIn the MEG dataset, all six MMN dipole sources were reconstructed to ensure a good dipole fit at each location and maximise variance explained. We used primary A1\u00a0sources as in previous studies ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and patients' STG and IFG source coordinates. These sources were modelled as equivalent current dipoles. Standard and deviant tones were reconstructed separately using the forward modelling described above and models were inverted using SPM 8's DCM-10 standard algorithm. \n\nWe investigated the alternative models in  C in each hemisphere separately and modelled the contralateral connectivity as fully connected ( ,  ). These models also included sensory inputs into bilateral A1 and bidirectional connections between A1 and STG as shown in  B. We repeated these models to investigate the presence and symmetry of the frontal expectancy inputs ( ), resulting in 48 models in total. We used a hierarchical model comparison approach to first compare model families and then compare the models within the winning family. The model families are shown in  D. Model family L12 explores the 12 models in  C for the left hemisphere whilst keeping full connectivity on the right hemisphere. Model family L12-RInput repeats L12 models and also includes a right frontal expectancy input. R12 and R12-LInput families explore these models again but in the opposite hemispheres. \n\nFinally, we modelled all possible combinations of the twelve models in Fig.\u00a01C across the two hemispheres in a   post hoc   analysis, resulting in 144 models (12\u00a0\u00d7\u00a012). This accounts for the above family comparison always including full connectivity in one hemisphere. \n\n\n### Model comparison and selection \n  \nBayesian model selection was used to compare the generative models ( ). Bayesian Model Selection compares the free-energy estimate (F) of the bound on the log of model evidence of each model,   ln p(y|m)   (the probability of the data y given each model m). This measure of model evidence adjusts model fit for complexity to reduce over-fitting ( ,  ). We used a fixed effects approach for both ECoG and MEG datasets, assuming our MEG population of healthy participants have the same network architecture underlying the observed data across the group with variation in connection strengths ( ,  ). It is also appropriate to use a fixed effects rather than random effects for single patient studies ( ). \n\nThe model with highest model evidence is referred to as the \u2018winning\u2019 model (implicitly, the winner from the inverted model set, not all possible models). A difference in model evidence between the winning and \u2018second place\u2019 models (\u0394F) of five units or more is comparable to a Bayes factor of 150 and by convention this is regarded as strong evidence for one model over another ( ). We calculated the posterior probability of each model and model family, the probability of that model as the generator of the data, contingent upon the current model space. A posterior probability >.95 is regarded as informative ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### ECoG localisation and analysis \n  \nECoG electrode locations were extracted from normalised MRI and CT images ( C). We masked and thresholded the CT image to contain voxels corresponding to the electrodes and clustered these to give electrode coordinates in standard anatomic space ( D and E left). These are shown overlaid on a representative brain in standard anatomic space in  D and E centre. Both patients had electrode coverage of STG\u00a0and IFG\u00a0regions close to the sources of the MMN. These electrodes are highlighted in green and blue respectively and form regions of interest for each area. CNRs for each electrode in these regions of interest are shown in  D and E right, from which we chose the electrodes with highest mean CNR over the 150\u2013250\u00a0msec time period. The MNI coordinates for each electrode are as follows: Patient L1 STG [\u221269, \u221235, 7] and IFG [\u221263, 8, \u22121], patient R2 STG [71, \u221237, 14] and IFG [68, 0, 17]. \n\n\n### Source analysis \n  \nDistributed sources of the MMN from the MEG data were localised using participants' structural T1 MRI images for the forward model and the MSP algorithm for the inversion.  A shows the group difference between standard and deviant tones using a one-sample   t  -test,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.01 with FWE correction for multiple comparisons. There were significant differences between conditions (i.e., MMN) in primary A1, STG and IFG, as expected. The local field potentials for the standard and deviant conditions in the chosen ECoG electrodes are shown in  B. The grey shaded areas show where there is a   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.01 significant difference between standard and deviant tones using a two-sample   t  -test across all trials, with 25\u00a0msec temporal cluster correction. All selected electrodes show significant differences during the characteristic MMN time-window of 150\u2013250\u00a0msec. Additionally,  C shows the group average standard and deviant dipoles at each of these electrode locations, from the healthy participants in the MEG study. The paired   t  -test results showed significant differences between standard and deviant group mean waveforms during the characteristic MMN time-window of 150\u2013250\u00a0msec. Note, the differences in the sign of the waveforms between methods are likely caused by the differences between the methods of source reconstruction of dipoles using MEG and ECoG electrode recordings of local field potentials within the underlying cortex. \n\n\n### Dynamic causal modelling \n  \n shows the results of Bayesian model selection with model evidences for ECoG and MEG datasets. For all datasets, the winning model is the one with highest relative log-evidence compared to the other models tested.  A shows model 12 is the winning model for patient L1 with \u0394  f  \u00a0=\u00a06.9, and has a posterior probability\u00a0\u2248\u00a01. Model 6 is the winning model for patient R2 with \u0394  f  \u00a0=\u00a05.3, and posterior probability\u00a0\u2248\u00a01. \n\nIn the MEG group, we analysed the model set hierarchically, by firstly comparing model families: grouping models investigating left or right changes in connection directions and modulation (L12 or R12) and grouping models where the contralateral side has inputs into the frontal sources (L/R Input) or does not. The winning family ( C) included models with frontal input into the left fully connected hemisphere and with variation in the direction and modulation of frontotemporal connections on the right side as shown in  C. \n\nWe then compared the twelve models within this family ( C). The overall winning model had modulated bidirectional connections between right frontotemporal sources but no frontal input (\u0394  f  \u00a0=\u00a082.4, posterior probability \u22481). Both sides of the MMN frontotemporal connections match the individual connectivity in each ECoG patient. All winning models have a \u0394  f  \u00a0>\u00a05, equivalent to a Bayes factor \u223c150 against the second model, providing strong evidence for the winning model against all other tested models. \n\nFinally, in a   post hoc   analysis, we varied all possible combinations of left and right connectivity resulting in 144 models to account for the family comparison always including full connectivity in one hemisphere ( ). We confirmed the same winning model as shown in  , with \u0394  f  \u00a0=\u00a017.4 and posterior probability\u00a0\u2248\u00a01. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe principal results of this study are that (i) DCM of invasive human ECoG supports the inferences derived from non-invasive MEG, providing construct validation; (ii) there is strong evidence for bilateral feedforward and feedback connections between frontal and superior temporal cortex, consistent with the predictive coding hypothesis and extending previous studies; and (iii) the expectancy input to prefrontal cortex is asymmetrical, being present on the left but not on the right according to the analysis of both modalities. The complementarity between ECoG\u00a0and MEG\u00a0balances the precise anatomical localisation and direct measurement of local field potentials against the ability to generalise to larger populations using inversion of safe non-invasive recordings. This is the first study to compare directly these two methods in the context of validation of DCM of task-based responses in humans, building on DCM of direct recordings in rodents and monkeys at rest. \n\nPrevious studies have identified a hierarchical network of primary A1, STG\u00a0and IFG\u00a0which are interpreted as supporting feedback sensory predictions and feedforward prediction errors ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Several studies have examined networks that generate a MMN response, and differed slightly according to the inclusion of lateral connections and/or a left frontal source ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). These network features were brought together by  , revealing evidence for bilateral frontotemporal feedforward and feedback connectivity across deviant dimensions, and variation in lateral connections across deviant dimensions. An important new feature was the expectancy input which can explain the activation of lower sensory areas in the partial or complete absence of an expected stimulus ( ,  ,  ). We successfully replicated the results of   in the current study using a larger and independent cohort of healthy adults. But, by broadening the model space we find that these expectancy signals act primarily on left prefrontal cortex. \n\nExamination of the direct cortical recordings, with generative models using homologous nodes to the MEG dataset, confirmed modulation of bidirectional frontotemporal connections in both patients and across the group MEG participants. This is in agreement with previous studies using a singular deviant dimension such as classic and roving oddball paradigms ( ,  ,  ,  ). Roving paradigms use deviant and standard tones with identical physical features to discount response differences to differences in the stimuli and extract a \u2018pure\u2019 MMN response ( ). Despite the potential differences between the MMN responses in the multiple oddball paradigm used in this study and classic and roving paradigms, our results reinforce the presence of bidirectional, modulated frontotemporal connections, demonstrating the generalisation of these connections across MMN responses. \n\nWe also observed evidence for a frontal expectancy unit in the patient with left hemisphere electrodes but not in the patient with the right hemisphere electrodes. This was in agreement with the MEG group results. Previous studies suggest asymmetry of the frontal function in sensory processing ( ), and there has been debate over the presence of a left prefrontal source for the mismatch negativity ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and its inclusion in models of connectivity ( ,  ,  ,  ). However in this study as in   we confirmed a significant difference between standard and deviant evoked responses in the left IFG. The expectancy input asymmetry contrasts with the bilateral interactions lower in the frontotemporal hierarchy, but might be accounted by the subtle asymmetry in frontal source locations which were specified by patient electrode locations within inferior frontal and superior temporal regions of interest. Previous studies have tended to use unilateral sources ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ), or impose symmetry of the expectancy input ( ,  ,  ,  ), and replication of the asymmetry of expectancy units would be helpful, from independent groups. \n\nThe location of sources is clearly critical in specifying the models. Here we used CNRs of the direct recordings to identify sources and applied these to the MEG data. Previous comparisons between ECoG and M/EEG have taken a similar approach, at least in the context of identifying the epileptogenic zone ( ,  ). There was good agreement of source location across modalities with additional validation by good outcomes after surgical resection. \n\nSeveral studies have provided face validation of fMRI and electrophysiological DCM, showing the effective connectivity method correctly identifies the models behind simulated data ( ,  ,  ), known connectivity and neural drivers in a rodent epilepsy model ( ) and known connectivity changes due to anaesthesia ( ). Other studies provide predictive validation by observing the same winning models across fMRI recordings in the same participants ( ,  ,  ,  ) and through the ability of stochastic fMRI DCM to predict frequency spectrum changes in simultaneous EEG recordings ( ). \n\nFurther studies provide construct validation of dynamical causal modelling through comparisons of winning models with other effective and functional connectivity measures ( ,  ) and comparisons across stochastic and spectral DCM methods ( ). Additionally, multimodal imaging provides important construct validation of DCM ( ,  ) along with potential spatiotemporal resolution advantages ( ,  ,  ). For example,   used simultaneous ECoG and EEG in a non-human primate for construct validation of steady-state DCM, showing the same winning models across modalities. Similar to our study they used reconstructed EEG sources at the same coordinates as their ECoG electrode sources. \n\nHuman multimodal effective connectivity studies have used EEG to identify epileptic seizure onset for fMRI based DCM ( ) and used EEG event related components to guide construction of fMRI based models ( ), but they do not compare models across modalities   per se  . This study is the first to provide construct validation of human evoked-response DCM through direct comparison of models across ECoG and MEG. As with  , we show good agreement across modalities for the critical features, which together with the replication of   indicates that DCM of human MEG is reliable. \n\nThe reliability of DCM supports its potential for clinical application. Connectivity measures complement functional and structural imaging, providing additional insights as well as greater sensitivity to disease presence, severity and treatment efficacy ( ). Using fMRI or M/EEG based methods, clinical applications include epilepsy ( ), depression ( ,  ), Parkinson's disease ( ,  ,  ) and stroke rehabilitation ( ). Additionally, DCM of the MMN has been used to study effective connectivity changes in neurodegenerative disease ( ), coma ( ), drug effects ( ,  ) and changes in healthy ageing ( ,  ,  ). \n\nSeveral limitations of this study arise from the nature of human invasive neuroimaging. Firstly, the two patients had drug resistant epilepsy, thus did not have healthy brains. However, we excluded electrodes that covered the epileptic foci as identified by the clinicians and electrodes that recorded epileptic spiking activity. \n\nSecondly, electrode coverage for each patient was limited and did not provide full coverage of the six-node network modelled in previous studies ( ,  ,  ,  ). However, there is sufficient overlap, and replication of sites, to allow one to test the hypotheses related to DCM. The generative networks used for ECoG are nested within the generative models used for MEG, and we matched the coordinates in MNI space between ECoG and MEG analyses. The ECoG data cannot directly speak to the validation of the elements of the network that we do not have data for, thus we have not shown generalisation to all areas in the MMN network. This does not prevent the construct validation across modalities for the frontotemporal elements that are common to both ECoG and MEG and allow one to test the principal hypotheses related to DCM. We propose generalisation across modalities for frontotemporal feed-forward and feed-back influences in hierarchical models. Further, ECoG limitations include the electrode coverage which did not overlap across patients, thus we cannot directly compare models across patients. This is a common problem with human invasive studies. It was not practical for the patient participants to also undergo MEG. \n\nThere are also methodological considerations. We aimed to compare similar sources across methodologies, but the ECoG was from single subjects whereas MEG is a group wise analysis. Exact locations may vary. Moreover, the inversion of the lead field to a subject specific head model and the warping of this head model to standard anatomic space using coregistered MRI is common, with robust algorithms. In contrast, the gross distortion of anatomy due to the craniectomy and the presence of cortical surface electrodes may introduce normalisation difficulty. We therefore used a different method for normalisation of patient data ( ). We suggest however, that the spatial tolerance of source modelling is greater than the likely normalisation differences arising from the two methods. \n\nFinally, DCM is intended for hypothesis testing and model comparison, not data driven searches amongst all possible models. Despite a large model set in comparison to many studies, other network configurations are possible. We took a structured and hierarchical approach, first identifying the most likely family of twelve models based on their shared critical features, and then the most likely model within this family.   Post hoc   examination across the whole set of 144 models confirmed this winning model, but this is not inevitable and future studies may also justify the preliminary identification of an optimal model family in a hierarchical approach to model selection (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nIn conclusion, we find strong agreement in the critical features of effective connectivity inferred from invasive and non-invasive neurophysiology, in a robust auditory oddball task. This bridges between invasive animal models and more common modes of non-invasive human neuroimaging. Both methods supported the presence of feedforward and feedback interactions in frontotemporal networks which we propose carry sensory errors and predictions respectively, in addition to left prefrontal expectancy signals. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4981429, "text_md5": "26a3cc4738b52888047115438c457a31", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 148], "journal": [149, 155], "publication_year": [157, 161], "title": [172, 287], "keywords": [301, 400], "abstract": [413, 2653], "body": [2662, 36827]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 27389803, "doi": "10.1016/j.cortex.2016.05.001", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4981429", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4981429"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4981429\">4981429</a>", "list_title": "PMC4981429  Convergent evidence for hierarchical prediction networks from human electrocorticography and magnetoencephalography"}
