Stimulus-dependent activation in experimental pain was further divided into \"thermal\" and \"non thermal\" stimuli. A conjunction of experimentally induced and chronic neuropathic pain revealed activation of the bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex, right middle cingulate cortex, right inferior parietal lobe, supplementary motor area, right caudal anterior insula, and bilateral thalamus.

Chronic neuropathic pain studies showed increased activation in the left secondary somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and right caudal anterior insula when compared to experimentally induced pain. Activation clusters in the anterior cingulate cortex and caudal anterior insula suggest a strong emotional contribution to the processing of chronic neuropathic pain.
