This adult-oriented study assesses whether altered amygdala structure and function is present following low-risk preterm birth. T1-weighted and resting-state functional MRI images of 33 low-risk preterm (30\u201336\u00a0weeks\u2019 GA) and 29 full-term (37\u201342\u00a0weeks\u2019 GA) young adults of both sexes, aged between 20 and 32\u00a0years old, were analyzed using FreeSurfer (v6.0.0) and Coon Toolbox (v21.a). The social-emotional assessment included Happ\u00e9\u2019s Strange Stories Test, the Moral Judgment Test, Delay-Discounting Test, Adult Self Report, and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. No differences were found in social-emotional outcomes or amygdala volumes between the groups. Low-risk preterm young adults showed increased FC between the left amygdala, right amygdala and medial frontal cortex (MedFC) (  F  \u2009=\u20099.89,   p  -FWE\u2009=\u20090.009) at cluster level compared to their full-term peers. However, significant results at connection level were not observed between left and right amygdala. Lastly, increased FC at cluster level between the right amygdala and MedFC, and left amygdala and MedFC, was related to better social-emotional outcomes only in low-risk preterm young adults (  F  \u2009=\u20096.60,   p  -FWE\u2009=\u20090.036) at cluster level. At connection level, in contrast, only right amygdala\u2013MedFC increased FC was significantly associated with better social-emotional outcomes. This study reveals that low-risk prematurity does not have an effect on social-emotional outcomes or structural amygdala volumes during young adulthood. However, individuals who were considered to be at a lower risk of exhibiting neurodevelopmental alterations following preterm birth demonstrated increased FC between the left and right amygdala and MedFC. \n \n\n# Body\n \nPrematurity is defined as any birth before 37 complete weeks of gestation (WHO  ). Neonates suffering from subtle neurological abnormalities and perinatal comorbidities who were born low-risk preterm [30- to 36-week gestational age (GA)] make up the majority of preterm deliveries (Caravale et al.  ; Hart et al.  ). Moreover, most children born low-risk preterm exhibit a profile of cognitive and behavioral problems shared with children born at term predominantly with socioeconomic risk factors (Johnson et al.  ). However, brain alterations following low-risk preterm birth may be the cause of their plausibly unfavorable long-term neurodevelopment (Walsh et al.  ). In line with this, social-emotional functioning appears to be essential for optimal long-term neurodevelopment (Oberle et al.  ; Peralta-Carcelen et al.  ), especially since children and adolescents born moderate and late preterm are at higher risk of emotional and behavioral problems (Cheong and Doyle  ). \n\nEmotional symptoms (e.g., often unhappy, downhearted, etc.) have been predicted by different brain volumetric values following very preterm birth (<\u200932-week GA), including amygdala structure (Liverani et al.  ). The amygdala is highly innervated by glucocorticoid receptors, and the peak of corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor density occurs during the early postnatal weeks, making the newborn stage a time of increased susceptibility to stress (VanTieghem and Tottenham  ). Following preterm delivery, structural alterations in the amygdala have been found at term equivalent age and childhood (Cismaru et al.  ; Mueller et al.  ). Moreover, the presence of altered amygdala functional connectivity (FC) following very preterm birth suggests that there is a different pattern of associations with social-emotional abilities (e.g., emotion regulation) compared to those born at term, which may point to a reduced degree of functional architecture maturation (Kanel et al.  ; Rogers et al.  ; Siffredi et al.  ). According to a study based on extremely preterm neonates, prenatal stress leads to a significantly reduced connection between the left amygdala and other areas when compared to those not suffering from such stress (Scheinost et al.  ). \n\nThe amygdala\u2013prefrontal cortex circuit is also impacted by negative experiences and stress (VanTieghem and Tottenham  ). In the general population, early life stress has been linked to increased negative centromedial amygdala\u2013ventromedial prefrontal cortex connection (Miller et al.  ). Changes in the function of this circuit seem to have an effect on how emotions are regulated and increase the risk of psychiatric disorders (VanTieghem and Tottenham  ). For instance, greater exposure to pain-related stress in infants born low-risk preterm has been linked to disrupted developmental scores (Morag et al.  ). \n\nFrom a neurodevelopmental perspective, individuals\u2019 reactions to emotional events shift significantly from childhood to adulthood (Silvers et al.  ). The amygdala\u2013prefrontal brain circuit continues developing until early adulthood despite the fact that amygdala reactivity diminishes during aging (VanTieghem and Tottenham  ). However, in preterm populations, although decreased amygdala volume and altered FC have been described, only social functioning (e.g., increased social difficulties, heightened levels of anxiety and depression, reduced extroversion, and poor self-esteem) correlates with altered amygdala\u2013posterior cingulate FC, with no structural associations shown during adulthood (Johns et al.  ; Schmitz-Koep et al.  ). In fact, due to functional changes in key emotion processing brain networks, including suboptimal amygdala modulation, adults born very preterm continue to exhibit subtle abnormalities in emotion recognition (Papini et al.  ). Nevertheless, there are still no data available concerning low-risk preterm samples. \n\nDeficits of social-emotional abilities in those born preterm have a substantial influence on their quality of life and on the burden of healthcare in society (Linsell et al.  ; Raju et al.  ). Furthermore, atypical development of the amygdala subnuclei volumes together with its altered FC have been related to social-emotional abilities in children born very preterm (Mueller et al.  ). For this reason, and given the lack of studies that focus on those considered to be at lower risk of exhibiting neurodevelopmental alterations following preterm birth, this study aims to assess the different social-emotional profiles between young adults born low-risk preterm and their full-term counterparts. Besides, it aims to analyze amygdala structure and its FC with medial frontal cortex (MedFC) in young adults born low-risk preterm. Finally, the study seeks to evaluate the possible associations during young adulthood between social-emotional outcomes and amygdala volumes and FC (i.e., amygdala\u2013MedFC) following low-risk preterm birth. It was hypothesized that, based on the literature (Cheong and Doyle  ; Cismaru et al.  ; Mueller et al.  ), young adults born low-risk preterm would have reduced amygdala volumes and FC, as well as obtaining lower social-emotional scores, than the full-term controls. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSixty-two young adults in total (aged between 20 and 32\u00a0years) took part in this prospective observational cross-sectional study: 33 low-risk preterm (M \u2009=\u200925.33\u00a0years; SD \u2009=\u20092.92) and 29 full-term (M \u2009=\u200926.41\u00a0years; SD \u2009=\u20092.24) subjects. A group of preterm young adults at lower risk of exhibiting major disabilities was recruited at Cruces University Hospital (Barakaldo, Spain) by chain-referral sampling from September 2018 to April 2021. This group of 33 young adults born preterm at 30\u201336\u00a0weeks of gestation and with the following inclusion/exclusion criteria were considered to be at lower risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes as previously reviewed by our research group (Fern\u00e1ndez de Gamarra-Oca et al.  ): (1) 30- to 36-week gestational age (GA), (2) absence of brain pathology identified by neonatal cranial ultrasound, (3) lack of substantial neonatal morbidity (i.e., congenital neurological, cardiac, respiratory or digestive malformations, necrotizing enterocolitis, or septic shock), and (4) ranging in age at time of evaluation from 20 to 40\u00a0years. A full-term group of 29 subjects was recruited, with the inclusion criteria for these participants being as follows: (1)\u2009>\u200937-week GA, and (2) ranging in age at time of evaluation from 20 to 40\u00a0years. The exclusion criteria for both low-risk preterm and full-term groups were a history of acquired brain injury, cerebral palsy or any other neurological impairment, congenital malformations, and chromosomal abnormalities. \n\n\n### Measures \n  \n#### Social-emotional assessment \n  \nSocial-emotional functioning was measured according to the following domains, with the instruments used to measure each domain being described below. All instrument scores (i.e., theory of mind and moral competence total scores, delay gratification ratio, internalizing and externalizing problem scores and cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression punctuations) were standardized by transforming them into   z  -scores to create a composite score to measure social-emotional functioning (henceforth referred to as social-emotional outcomes). Cronbach\u2019s alpha (reliability) coefficient was 0.78. \n\n Theory of mind   was measured using the Happ\u00e9\u2019s Strange Stories Test (Happ\u00e9  ) by selecting four of the original stories to represent a lie, white lie, misunderstanding, and pretense. The participant is asked to deduce the thoughts and intentions of the characters in each narrative. For example, in the mentalizing story involving a double bluff, a 2-point answer might be the prisoner tried to trick the army by telling the truth, and so the army will look on the opposite side to the one he says. A 1-point answer for the same story would demonstrate partial understanding: reference the results or a simple bluff. A 0-point answer would be incorrect, such as since the prisoner was afraid, he wanted to reveal the truth. \n\n Moral competence   was evaluated by means of the Moral Judgment Test (MJT) (Lind  ), characterizing the ability to make morally upstanding decisions and judgments in two dilemma situations\u2014the \u201cworkers\u2019 dilemma\u201d (i.e., refers to labor rights and professional ethics) and \u201cmercy killing dilemma\u201d (i.e., refers to euthanasia in a medical setting). The MJT specifically assesses the respondent\u2019s ability to score arguments (for and against a protagonist\u2019s action in a dilemma situation) in terms of moral quality rather than opinion agreement. For most participants, this is a tough task; only a few responders score greater than 40 on the C-scale from 0 to 100. \n\nThe Delay-Discounting Test (DDT) (Kirby and Marakovi\u0107  ), also called the Monetary Choice Questionnaire, assessed   delayed gratification   by participants answering 21 questions, such as the following: \u201cWould you rather have \u20ac85 in 14\u00a0days or \u20ac30 now?\u201d. \n\nThe Adult Self Report (ASR) was employed as a measure of   emotional-behavioral functioning   (Achenbach et al.  ). The questionnaire provides scores for the following scales: anxious/depressed, withdrawn, somatic complaints, thought problems, attention problems, aggressive behavior, rule-breaking behavior, and intrusive behavior. Internalizing and externalizing problems were also obtained from the sum of these scales. \n\nThe 10-item Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) measures participant predisposition for both   cognitive reappraisal   and   expressive suppression   of their emotions (Gross and John  ). Participants respond to each item on a Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). \n\n\n#### General cognitive assessment \n  \nThe Raven\u2019s Advanced Progressive Matrices (RPM) test was used to assess   analogical reasoning   as general non-verbal cognition (Raven and Court  ), while the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III (PPVT-III) was employed to measure   receptive language,   since it characterizes general verbal cognitive performance (Dunn and Dunn  ). \n\n\n#### Socioeconomic status (SES) \n  \nThe occupation and educational domains of participants and their parents were taken into account separately using the Hollingshead Index (Hollingshead  ). The participants\u2019   self-SES   (i.e., participants\u2019 ongoing occupation and highest level of education) and   familial SES   (i.e., the average of parents\u2019 retrospective occupation and highest level of education) were thus two distinct measures that were obtained. \n\n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \n3-dimensional MRI datasets were obtained from the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Unit OSATEK, Galdakao Hospital (Galdakao, Spain) for 64 participants; however, two were eventually excluded due to difficulties in the acquisition process. The radiologist (J.M.O.) reported that all MRI images were non-pathological. Hence, there was a final sample of 33 low-risk preterm and 29 full-term young adults. A single session was used to acquire both sequences. T1-weighted images were also obtained from a Philips 3T Achieva dStream (axial orientation, 3\u00a0min 58.9\u00a0s session, 160 slices, TR/TE\u2009=\u20098.1/3.7\u00a0ms, 288\u2009\u00d7\u2009248 matrix, 8\u00b0 flip angle, 1\u00a0mm slice thickness, no gap), and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was also acquired: 8\u00a0min session, 315 whole-brain gradient echo-planar images, 44 axial slices, TR/TE\u2009=\u20091500/30\u00a0ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009132\u00a0mm , and voxel size\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u00a0mm . \n\nBefore acquiring rs-fMRI, the participant\u2019s head was restrained from movement and protected from scanner noise using foam padding and earplugs. Subjects were told not to perform any specific cognitive or physical tasks, keep their eyes closed, and avoid falling asleep. After scanning, participants completed the Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire (ARSQ) (Alexander Diaz et al.  ), which is a 27-item self-report survey covering seven dimensions of   resting-state cognition   (i.e., discontinuity of mind, theory of mind, self, planning, sleepiness, comfort, and somatic awareness). \n\n\n### Image preprocessing \n  \n#### Whole and subnuclei amygdala volumes \n  \nFreeSurfer ( ) (version v6.0.0) was used in order to obtain whole and subnuclei amygdala volumes from 3-dimensional T1-weighted MRI scans (Fischl  ). T1-weighted image processing included several procedures: intensity non-uniformity correction, skull stripping, affine transformation to an MNI template, intensity normalization, removal of non-brain tissue, linear and non-linear transformations to a probabilistic brain atlas, and the labeling of subcortical/allocortical structures. Spatial localization priors were used to determine the correct label voxel-per-voxel, and skull stripping, intensity normalization, white matter segmentation, and surface extraction errors were all manually corrected where necessary. Subsequently, the amygdala was segmented automatically based on the Saygin et al. ( ) atlas into central, lateral, basal, accessory basal, cortical, medial, and paralaminar nuclei, as well as into the corticoamygdaloid transition area and anterior amygdaloid area. \n\n\n#### Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) \n  \nFC analyses were carried out using the CONN Functional Connectivity Toolbox version 21.a (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon  ). Each subject\u2019s 315 functional images were realigned and unwarped, their slice-timing corrected, coregistered with structural data, spatially normalized into standard MNI space (Montreal Neurological Institute, Canada), and their outliers detected (ART-based scrubbing; to eliminate any influence of outlier scans on the BOLD signal, noise components are employed as potential confounding effects). During outlier detection (intermediate level, 97th percentile: 0.9\u00a0mm 5\u00a0s.d.), potential outlier scans of frame-wise displacements\u2009>\u20090.9\u00a0mm or BOLD signal changes\u2009>\u20095\u00a0s.d. were detected and flagged as potential outliers. Finally, they were smoothed with an 8-mm Gaussian kernel full with half maximum (FWHM) to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. No outliers were detected in this sample. The default preprocessing pipeline for volume-based analysis (to MNI space) was used for all preprocessing steps, and the structural data were normalized and segmented into GM, WM, and CSF. The anatomical CompCor method was used to reduce noise by extracting the principal components (5 each) from the WM and CSF time series. The subject\u2019s estimated motion parameters and other artificial effects, such as BOLD signals in WM and CSF, which were included as additional confounds, were then removed by a denoising process that was implemented using linear regression and band-pass filtering (0.008\u20130.09\u00a0Hz) (Weissenbacher et al.  ). \n\n\n\n### Statistical and imaging analysis \n  \nNormal distribution of data was assessed using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test (K\u2013S), while the Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to analyze differences in GA, and self- and familial SES. Furthermore, the Chi-squared test was required to assess differences in two qualitative sociodemographic characteristics: gender and handedness. Student\u2019s   t  -tests were also performed to compare birthweight (BW) and age at time of evaluation between the groups. \n\nA multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted to compare different social-emotional domains (adjusted for age and self-SES), whole amygdala volumes (adjusted for age, self-SES, and eTIV), and amygdala subnuclei volumes (adjusted for age, self-SES, and left/right amygdala volume), while partial eta squared was employed to calculate effect sizes; around 0.01 is considered a small size effect, 0.06 medium, and above 0.14 is considered large. Moreover, bivariate correlation analyses were performed to assess the relationships between social-emotional outcomes and amygdala volumes (i.e., whole and subnuclei volumetric values). For all preceding analyses, the SPSS version 28 was used, and significance level set at 0.05. \n\nRegarding FC statistical analysis, cluster-level inferences in region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analyses based on Threshold Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) approach was used (Smith and Nichols  ). This approach is used for thresholding ROI-to-ROI parametric maps while appropriately controlling the family-wise error (FWE) rate using TFCE analyses with a FWE corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 at cluster level, with the post hoc test FDR corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 at connection level. Between-group differences were assessed (with age and self-SES used as covariates) with Cluster-level ROI-to-ROI based on TFCE and the ROIs selected based on the Harvard\u2013Oxford Structures Atlas ( ) were as follows: (a) left amygdala, (b) right amygdala, and (c) MedFC. In addition, Pearson correlation analyses (i.e., each group independently) between the strength of FC and social-emotional data were also assessed with the same approach (Cluster-level ROI-to-ROI based on TFCE) and with the selected ROIs. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nNeonatal, sociodemographic, cognitive variables, and rs-fMRI mean movement are shown in detail in Table\u00a0 . As expected, there were significant differences in neonatal variables (GA and BW) between the groups. No differences were found in sociodemographic (i.e., sex, age, handedness, and familial SES), general cognitive measures (i.e., receptive language and analogical reasoning) or rs-fMRI mean movement between the groups, except in the case of the self-SES, with the low-risk preterm sample reporting lower scores. The following analyses will therefore be adjusted for self-SES together with specific covariates (see \u201c \u201d, Statistical analysis).   \nNeonatal, sociodemographic, and cognitive data \n  \nSignificant results are shown in bold \n\nNote:   SD   standard deviation,   GA   gestational age,   wks   weeks,   BW   birthweight,   g   grams,   yrs   years,   U   Mann\u2013Whitney U test,   t   Student   t  -test,   X   Chi-square test,   SES   socioeconomic status,   PPVT-III   Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III,   RPM   Raven\u2019s Advanced Progressive Matrices,   rs-fMRI   resting-state functional MRI \n  \n\n### Aim 1: differences in social-emotional outcomes \n  \nIn terms of social-emotional functioning, as shown in Table\u00a0 , no differences were shown between young adults born low-risk preterm and full-term. Neither were differences found between the groups in the composite score and social-emotional domains.   \nDifferences in social-emotional outcomes between low-risk preterm and full-term young adults \n  \nNote:   SD   standard deviation,   SES   socioeconomic status,   MJT   moral judgement test,   DDT   delay-discounting task,   partial eta squared \n  \n\n\n### Aim 2: differences in whole and subnuclei amygdala volumes and resting-state functional connectivity (FC) \n  \nNo significant differences were evidenced in relation to the whole left and right amygdala volumes or amygdala subnuclei volumes between young adults born low-risk preterm and full-term controls (see Table\u00a0 , Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nDifferences in whole and subnuclei amygdala volumes between low-risk preterm and full-term young adults \n  \nNote:   mm   cubic millimeter,   SD   standard deviation,   eTIV   total intracranial volume,   SES   socioeconomic status,   partial eta squared \n    \n Right and left subnuclei amygdala volumes  .   Note  : Coronal (  a  ) and sagittal (  b  ) views showing volumetric segmentation among groups in subnuclei amygdala volumes. In accordance with radiological convention, the left side is shown on the right of the image for each view. Coronal coordinate (  a  ):   x  :40.23,   y  :16.33,   z  :\u22122.30; and sagittal coordinate (  b  ):   x  :43.67,   y  :22.13,   z  :\u22126.46 \n  \n\nNeither were significant differences found between the total score (  F  \u2009=\u20090.97,   p  \u2009=\u20090.33) and seven individual dimensions of resting-state cognition (  F  \u2009=\u20090.11,   p  \u2009=\u20090.74;   F  \u2009=\u20091.89,   p  \u2009=\u20090.17;   F  \u2009=\u20092.62,   p  \u2009=\u20090.11;   F  \u2009=\u20090.49,   p  \u2009=\u20090.49;   F  \u2009=\u20090.04,   p  \u2009=\u20090.85;   F  \u2009=\u20090.01,   p  \u2009=\u20090.91;   F  \u2009=\u20090.04,   p  \u2009=\u20090.83) between the groups in the ARSQ. \n\nLow-risk preterm young adults evidenced left and right amygdala\u2013MedFC FC differences at cluster level (  F  \u2009=\u20099.89,   p  -FWE\u2009=\u20090.009) compared to the full-term group (see Fig.\u00a0 ). Specifically, young adults born low-risk preterm exhibited the following: (a) increased FC between the left amygdala and MedFC (  T   (58)\u2009=\u20092.93,   p  -FDR\u2009=\u20090.014), and (b) increased FC between the right amygdala and MedFC (  T   (58)\u2009=\u20092.25,   p  -FDR\u2009=\u20090.028) in comparison to their full-term peers. Nevertheless, no significant FC differences between the left amygdala and right amygdala (  T   (58)\u2009=\u20091.69,   p  -FDR\u2009=\u20090.096) were observed between the groups.   \n Left and right amygdala\u2013MedFC FC differences between low-risk preterm and full-term young adults  .   Note  : Low-risk preterm young adults showed left and right amygdala\u2013MedFC FC differences at cluster level compared to the full-term group. The significant results obtained at connection level were   a   increased FC between the left amygdala and MedFC, and   b   increased FC between the right amygdala and MedFC. Results were displayed using CONN Toolbox 21.a and Jamovi 1.6.1 \n  \n\n\n### Aim 3: correlation analysis \n  \nNo significant correlations were found in the low-risk preterm group or full-term group between social-emotional outcomes and amygdala volumetric values (i.e., whole and subnuclei volumes). \n\nPositive correlations (  F  \u2009=\u20096.60,   p  -FWE\u2009=\u20090.036) were found at cluster level between the strength of left and right amygdala\u2013MedFC and social-emotional outcomes only in young adults born low-risk preterm. Specifically, right amygdala\u2013MedFC strength was positively related to social-emotional outcomes (  T   (31)\u2009=\u20092.64,   p  -FDR\u2009=\u20090.038) in low-risk preterm young adults, albeit not in the full-term group. In other words, right amygdala\u2013MedFC increased FC was associated with better social-emotional outcomes in young adults born low-risk preterm (see Fig.\u00a0 ). However, specific to the low-risk preterm group, left amygdala\u2013MedFC strength did not correlate with social-emotional outcomes (  T   (31)\u2009=\u20091.91,   p  -FDR\u2009=\u20090.064). Moreover, no significant correlations were found between left and right amygdala FC strength and social-emotional outcomes in either group.   \nRight amygdala\u2013MedFC FC correlates with social-emotional outcomes in low-risk preterm young adults \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first study that has assessed amygdala volume and its FC in young adults born preterm who are considered to be at lower risk of exhibiting neurodevelopmental alterations. Although low-risk preterm delivery had no effect on social-emotional outcomes or whole and subnuclei amygdala volumes during young adulthood in this sample, increased FC strength between left and right amygdala and MedFC was nonetheless found. The human brain is equipped with a high degree of specialization in processing social inputs, with control ranging from neurotransmitter to neural network level (Dunbar  ). In other words, an optimal social performance is sustained by a healthy development of the social brain (Galv\u00e1n  ). According to Kennedy and Adolphs ( ), the best approach to understanding the social brain, including its dysfunction and recovery, is through large-scale networks rather than discrete structures. In fact, similarly, children and adolescents born very preterm also have enhanced FC in and between networks involved in higher-order cognitive performance (Wehrle et al.  ). \n\n### Social-emotional outcomes \n  \nPrematurity has been deemed an independent risk factor with regard to psychiatric disorders; social-emotional problems are particularly prevalent in samples of individuals who were born very preterm (Montagna and Nosarti  ). For instance, Gilchrist and colleagues ( ) identified a different biological basis for externalizing problems in adolescents born very preterm. Equally, a higher risk of delayed social competence in the first 2\u00a0years of life has been associated with births between 32 and 36\u00a0weeks\u2019 GA (Cheong et al.  ; Johnson et al.  ). However, according to this study covering young adulthood, there is a lack of social-emotional impairment due to prematurity per se rather than other neonatal comorbidities excluded in the sample characterization. Comparable to our results, up to the age of 5\u00a0years, no specific preterm social phenotypes have been established (Dean et al.  ). \n\n\n### Amygdala structure and FC \n  \nEven while amygdala volume is lastingly reduced in heterogeneous preterm samples during both childhood and adulthood (Chau et al.  ; Schmitz-Koep et al.  ), our results displayed no differences in amygdala volumetric values following low-risk preterm birth in current sample. These findings are in line with Rogers\u2019 study targeting children born late preterm (Rogers et al.  ). Moreover, following very preterm birth, smaller right basal, medial, and cortical nuclei volumes have been linked to social-emotional problems during childhood (Mueller et al.  ). Meanwhile, increased right centromedial amygdala response to social-emotional events has been displayed in typically developing adolescents (Miller et al.  ). \n\nFurthermore, with a small GA, both reduced and elevated FC are established between the left amygdala and other areas during the adult stage (Papini et al.  ). Current findings show that assessed low-risk preterm young adults have an increased FC in the following three structures: left amygdala, right amygdala, and MedFC. In other words, FC was greater between left and right amygdala as well as between left and right amygdala and MedFC at cluster level following low-risk prematurity when compared to adults born full term. Nevertheless, as other studies have suggested, reduced strength between amygdalar and thalamic networks during childhood, as well as reductions in the intrinsic FC between the centromedial subdivision of the right amygdala and prefrontal cortex in young adults, may potentially underlie emotional deficits following very preterm delivery (Mueller et al.  ; Papini et al.  ). The results obtained from this study, however, did not support a different FC between left and right amygdala at connection level in these adults born low-risk preterm. \n\n\n### Amygdala structural and FC correlates with social-emotional outcomes \n  \nOur findings reveal no associations between whole or subnuclei amygdala volumes and social-emotional outcomes. Accordingly, no associations between reduced basolateral amygdala volumes and increased social anxiety in adults born very preterm have been found either (Schmitz-Koep et al.  ). In healthy developing young adults, in contrast, the experience of stress during the first half of pregnancy may have enduring effects on amygdala structure and may consecutively predict depressive symptoms (Mareckova et al.  ). Nonetheless, as mentioned above, rather than precise structures, networks may be what sustain social brain activity (Kennedy and Adolphs  ). \n\nLastly, this study indicates that both the right amygdala\u2013MedFC and left amygdala\u2013MedFC increased strengths at cluster level were related to social-emotional outcomes in assessed young adults born low-risk preterm. Higher FC between these areas is linked to optimal social-emotional adult functioning following low-risk prematurity. Likewise, better social-emotional abilities have been associated with improved engagement across different networks in children born very preterm (Siffredi et al.  ). However, increased amygdala\u2013ventral medial prefrontal brain FC has also been related to greater levels of sadness in typically developing infants (Thomas et al.  ), and less mature social-emotional functioning during adolescence has also been associated with positive frontoamygdala FC (Miller et al.  ). In other words, negative frontoamygdala FC has been deemed crucial in order to properly handle more demanding contexts concerning social-emotional processes (Callaghan and Tottenham  ). As per Gee and colleagues ( ), accelerated amygdala\u2013prefrontal development may be considered an ontogenetic adaptation in response to early adversity. Discrepancies found between studies could therefore be explained by different degrees of immaturity or by age-related improvements in emotion regulation caused by changes in activation and FC between prefrontal and amygdala circuits (Silvers et al.  ). \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nUnlike previous studies, this study evaluated social-emotional outcomes and amygdala structure and its FC in low-risk preterm and full-term individuals during young adulthood. In other words, unlike previous studies using heterogeneous preterm samples, this study employed neonatal and sociodemographic data to attain comparable groups, thus improving generalizability in terms of results. However, there was no longitudinal follow-up from early childhood to young adulthood so as to determine whether social-emotional outcomes or amygdala structure and its FC were developing commonly or not over time. Another drawback is sample size, which limits the interpretation of these results (i.e., a small power of analysis encourages a type 2 error) as well as the estimation of any differences between sex. Furthermore, although FC between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex is known to be critical for social-emotional functioning (Ochsner et al.  ), other areas or networks that may be involved (i.e., lateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, among others) were not examined in this study. Lastly, we found a significant difference in self-SES with the low-risk preterm group obtaining lower scores. However, subsequent analyses were adjusted in the case of this variable. This finding resonates with results from other studies in which prematurity has been previously associated with a lower rate of job success during adulthood (Bilgin et al.  ; Kroll et al.  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, according to the results obtained from this study, low-risk prematurity has no impact on social-emotional outcomes or amygdala volumes during young adulthood. This may suggest that preterm birth does not imply any atypical amygdalar development, since damage to it impairs the recognition of social emotions (Adolphs et al.  ). Nonetheless, such differences could be found in larger preterm-born samples, given the sample size of the current study that leads to a small power of analysis incrementing type 2 error. Moreover, whereas social-emotional difficulties have been demonstrated in the first years of life (Cheong et al.  ; Johnson et al.  ), an increase in amygdalar FC with MedFC was observed in the studied low-risk preterm sample during adolescence and young adulthood. However, additional research is needed to provide more data concerning brain FC development and its associations with social-emotional outcomes in larger low-risk preterm samples. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10917835, "text_md5": "d0c6d215cec63cafa6a6ac13c9d68ffa", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 199], "journal": [200, 218], "publication_year": [220, 224], "title": [235, 347], "keywords": [361, 459], "abstract": [472, 2321], "body": [2330, 33277]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 38236400, "doi": "10.1007/s00429-023-02749-1", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10917835", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10917835"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10917835\">10917835</a>", "list_title": "PMC10917835  Amygdala structure and function and its associations with social-emotional outcomes in a low-risk preterm sample"}
