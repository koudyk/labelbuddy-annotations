Dynamic functional connectivity is instrumental to cognitive functions but has not been investigated in insomnia disorder. This study assessed between\u2010network functional connectivity strength and variability in patients with insomnia disorder as compared with matched controls without sleep complaints. Twelve\u2010minute resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance images and T1\u2010weighed images were acquired in 65 people diagnosed with insomnia disorder (21\u201369\u00a0years, 48 female) and 65 matched controls without sleep complaints (22\u201370\u00a0years, 42 female). Pairwise correlations between the activity time series of 14 resting\u2010state networks and temporal variability of the correlations were compared between cases and controls. After false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons, people with insomnia disorder and controls did not differ significantly in terms of mean between\u2010network functional connectivity strength; people with insomnia disorder did, however, show less functional connectivity   variability   between the anterior salience network and the left executive\u2010control network. The finding suggests less flexible interactions between the networks during the resting state in people with insomnia disorder. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nInsomnia disorder (ID) is a chronic sleep disorder of high prevalence and tremendous socioeconomic burden. To date, treatment options for ID have been limited. Cognitive\u2010behaviour therapy is effective in reducing symptoms but still leaves room for improvement (Harvey & Tang,  ). Pharmacological interventions are usually effective only in the short term and can incur several side\u2010effects. There is an urgent need of developing novel interventions for ID, which in turn depends on a better understanding of its neural pathophysiology. \n\nRecently, resting\u2010state functional connectivity (FC) in ID has been increasingly studied and suggests involvement of distributed brain systems (\u201cfunctional networks\u201d). However, findings from different studies are not always consistent (Tahmasian et al.,  ). Multiple reasons could explain discrepancies across studies. For instance, small sample sizes and heterogeneity of ID in combination with different selection criteria might result in study populations corresponding to distinct clinical characteristics. Another reason specific to FC could be that it fluctuates over time and did not \u201caverage out\u201d equally in all studies. This latter consideration is important as it has been recognized that not only FC but also its dynamics are crucially engaged in brain functions. \n\nAberrant FC of the salience network (SN) with other brain regions has often been implicated in ID (Khazaie et al.,  ). Interactions between the SN and other cognitive systems are nonetheless highly variable (Chen, Cai, Ryali, Supekar, & Menon,  ). It has been proposed that dysregulated dynamic interactions among cognitive networks underlie pathological mentation in psychiatric disorders, and that the SN represents a major source of automatic (e.g. affective) constraints on mental activities (Christoff, Irving, Fox, Spreng, & Andrews\u2010Hanna,  ). Given the key role of cognitive and affective control in ID (Schmidt, Harvey, & Linden,  ), we hypothesized that people with ID would exhibit alterations in FC dynamics among functional networks, especially in those involving the SN. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated between\u2010network resting\u2010state FC strength and variability in patients with ID as compared with matched controls without sleep complaints. To our knowledge, this is the first study on dynamic FC in ID. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe analysed resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of 65 people meeting the DSM\u20105 criteria for ID (21\u201369\u00a0years, 48 female) and 65 age\u2010 and sex\u2010matched controls without sleep complaints (22\u201370\u00a0years, 42 female) from a previously reported study (Leerssen et al.,  ). Exclusion criteria for all participants were: (a) diagnosed current or past neurological or psychiatric disorders other than ID; (b) current sleep disorders other than ID, including signs of frequent hypopnea or leg movements during 2\u2005nights of laboratory polysomnography; (c) shift work; (d) use of sleep medications within the prior 2\u00a0months; (e) MRI contraindications; (f) excessive head movements (>\u20053\u00a0mm) or video\u2010monitored eye closure indicative of falling asleep during fMRI acquisition. Assessments were part of more elaborate studies, which were approved by the Ethics Review Board of the University of Amsterdam. All participants provided written informed consent. \n\n\n### Imaging protocol \n  \nParticipants were scanned on 3\u2010Tesla MRI scanners of the same brand and type (Achieva, Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) with 32\u2010channel head coils at two different sites of the Spinoza Centre for Neuroimaging, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. On the assessment days, participants were asked to refrain from alcohol and drugs. Participants were not allowed to consume caffeinated beverages for at least 6\u00a0hr before the MRI scanning sessions. Scans were made between 09:00\u2005and 20:00\u00a0hours. Twelve\u2010minute (288 volumes) resting\u2010state functional images were acquired from a single\u2010shot echo\u2010planar imaging (EPI) gradient echo sequence with the following scanning parameters: repetition time\u00a0=\u00a02,500\u00a0ms; echo time\u00a0=\u00a028\u00a0ms; phase\u2010encoding direction\u00a0=\u00a0AP/RL; flip angle\u00a0=\u00a077.2\u00b0; field of view\u00a0=\u00a0240\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0118 mm  (AP\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0RL\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0FH); voxel size\u00a0=\u00a02.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.5 mm ; slice gap\u00a0=\u00a010%; SENSE factor\u00a0=\u00a02 (AP). During acquisition, participants were instructed to look at a fixation cross, lie still, keep their eyes open, think of nothing in particular, and try not to fall asleep. Additionally, T1\u2010weighted images were acquired from a 3D Turbo Field Echo sequence with the following scanning parameters: repetition time\u00a0=\u00a08.3\u00a0ms; echo time\u00a0=\u00a03.8\u00a0ms; phase\u2010encoding direction\u00a0=\u00a0RL; flip angle\u00a0=\u00a08\u00b0; field of view\u00a0=\u00a0240\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0188\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0220 mm  (AP\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0RL\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0FH); voxel size\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 mm ; SENSE factors\u00a0=\u00a02.5 (RL), 2 (FH). \n\n\n### Image preprocessing \n  \nThe fMRI Expert Analysis Tool in FMRIB's Software Library (FSL) version 5.0.9 was used for: (a) brain extraction; (b) removal of the first five volumes to exclude T1 saturation effects; (c) motion correction; (d) B  inhomogeneity\u2010induced distortion correction; (e) boundary\u2010based registration (BBR) with the T1\u2010weighted image; and (f) spatial smoothing (FWHM\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0mm). Motion artefacts were subsequently removed by ICA\u2010AROMA followed by nuisance regression (mean white\u2010matter and cerebrospinal\u2010fluid signals and a linear trend) and high\u2010pass filtering (60\u00a0s cutoff; Pruim et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Between\u2010network static and dynamic functional connectivity \n  \nThe current study investigated the\u00a0interactions between 14 well\u2010known functional networks (Shirer, Ryali, Rykhlevskaia, Menon, & Greicius,  ). We registered the standard MNI152 structural image to each participant's T1\u2010weighted image using the non\u2010linear Symmetric Normalization (SyN) algorithm implemented in the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) version 2.1.0. The non\u2010linear SyN transformation and the BBR transformation matrix were concatenated so as to register the network maps to the EPI space. Each fMRI volume was spatially regressed on the 14 registered network maps. The resulting regression coefficients, representing network activity at each timeframe, were concatenated into 14 network activity time series. Between\u2010network FC strength was quantified by pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients between the network activity time series. \n\nTo study dynamic FC, pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for each 1\u2010min window (24 volumes) sliding in steps of one volume. We used 1\u2010min sliding windows so that reasonably reliable correlation coefficients could be estimated. The length of the correlation coefficient time series for each network pair was thus 283\u00a0\u2013\u00a024\u00a0+\u00a01\u2005=\u2005260 (number of sliding windows). The correlation coefficients were Fisher\u2010transformed (to obtain normally distributed values), after which their standard deviations over time were taken to quantify between\u2010network FC variability. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nGroup differences in FC strength and variability were evaluated according to the following steps. First, Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum   Z   statistic for each network pair was computed separately within each scanning site. Next, the Stouffer\u2013Lipt\u00e1k method was used to combine the   Z  \u2010values from each site into a final set of   Z  \u2010values, which were then converted to   p  \u2010values. Finally, Benjamini\u2013Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied to account for multiple comparisons over 14\u00a0\u00d7\u00a013/2\u00a0=\u00a091 network pairs. Associations with clinical characteristics were evaluated with Spearman correlation coefficients in follow\u2010up analyses. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nFigure  a shows the mean FC strength over 12\u00a0min for each network pair, averaged over people with ID and controls. It can be seen that people with ID and controls exhibited highly similar between\u2010network FC patterns. Statistical comparisons confirmed that there was no significant group difference with respect to static between\u2010network FC (\u20132.00\u00a0<\u00a0  Z\u00a0  <\u00a02.28,   p  \u00a0>\u00a0.94 for all network pairs). \n  \n(a) Mean between\u2010network functional connectivity (FC), and (b) variability of between\u2010network FC, in people with insomnia disorder (ID) and matched controls (CTRL). aSN, anterior salience network; BG, basal ganglia network; dDMN, dorsal default\u2010mode network; LECN, left executive\u2010control network; pSN, posterior salience network; RECN, right executive\u2010control network; vDMN, ventral default\u2010mode network; V1, primary visual network; V2, higher visual network \n  \nFigure  b shows the variability of FC for each network pair, averaged over people with ID and controls. Statistical comparisons revealed that people with ID had significantly less FC variability between the anterior salience network (aSN) and the left executive\u2010control network (LECN;   Z\u00a0  =\u00a0\u22123.80,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.01) as well as less FC variability between the aSN and the dorsal default\u2010mode network (dDMN) at a trend level (  Z\u00a0  =\u00a0\u22123.20,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.06). The effects were in the same direction within each scanning site (Table  ), confirming the robustness of group differences. No significant or trend\u2010level group difference in FC variability was observed for any other network pair (  p  \u00a0>\u00a0.32). \n  \nFunctional\u00a0connectivity variability between the aSN and the LECN/dDMN (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0  SD  ) within each scanning site and the associated Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum   Z   statistics \n    \nThe self\u2010reported Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; Bastien, Valli\u00e8res, & Morin,  ) and Hyperarousal Scale (HAS; Pavlova et al.,  ) as well as polysomnographic sleep parameters (2nd night) were available in the majority of the participants (Table  ). Correlation analyses indicated that aSN\u2013LECN FC variability was significantly and negatively associated with the ISI (  r  [127]\u00a0=\u00a0\u2013.34,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.0001; Figure  ) and not significantly associated with the other clinical characteristics. \n  \nSelf\u2010reported and polysomnographic measures (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0  SD  ) and their correlations with functional connectivity variability between the aSN and the LECN \n      \nAssociation of functional connectivity variability between the anterior salience network (aSN) and the left executive\u2010control network (LECN) with the Insomnia Severity Index.

By focusing on network\u2013network interactions, we found that while mean between\u2010network FC strength remains similar in patients and controls, aSN\u2013LECN FC   variability   is significantly reduced in ID. \n\nAlthough we did not observe significant group differences in static between\u2010network FC, we do not exclude that static FC differences might exist at more fine\u2010grained spatial scales (Leerssen et al.,  ). Previous resting\u2010state fMRI\u00a0studies have suggested that hyperarousal in ID involves the SN (Khazaie et al.,  ). These studies only examined mean FC strength over several minutes and did not evaluate possible FC fluctuations occurring at faster time\u2010scales. Interestingly, a recent study utilizing electroencephalographic microstates to assess sub\u2010second network dynamics during the resting state found in people with ID shortened mean microstate duration for a particular microstate class commonly associated with the SN (Wei, Ramautar, Colombo, Lindert, & Someren,  ). The finding together with the current results strengthens the notion of impaired SN dynamics in ID, which could be observed at both sub\u2010second and minute\u2010by\u2010minute time\u2010scales. \n\nOne important function of the SN is modulating the activation and deactivation of the default\u2010mode network (DMN) and the executive\u2010control network (ECN). Proper functioning of the SN thus entails its flexible interactions with the DMN and the ECN. Reduced dynamic FC of the SN in ID may indicate a compromised capability of people with ID to switch between networks in response to changing environments and needs. This implication is supported by previous task\u2010based fMRI studies showing hypoactivation of the left inferior frontal gyrus (part of the LECN; Altena et al.,  ) and failure to deactivate the DMN (Drummond et al.,  ) in people with ID during demanding cognitive tasks. \n\nFurthermore, it has been demonstrated that the FC dynamics of the SN predict individual differences in cognitive flexibility (Chen et al.,  ). Recent neuroimaging studies have found that the affective signatures of negative emotional memories persist through extinction learning (Seo et al.,  ) and over the long term (Wassing et al.,  ) in ID, pointing to deficient adaptation as a result of emotional inflexibility. With respect to spontaneous mental activity, deficient cognitive\u2010affective flexibility may in particular manifest in the form of negatively\u2010toned repetitive thoughts (e.g. rumination; Christoff et al.,  ). As dysfunctional thought control has long been considered a key factor that causally contributes to chronic insomnia symptoms (Schmidt et al.,  ), our results suggest that cognitive\u2010affective flexibility may represent a promising venue for ID management. \n\n\n## LIMITATIONS \n  \nAs articulated above, we regarded between\u2010network FC dynamics, especially those pertaining to the SN, as most relevant to the pathophysiology of ID. Possible alterations in FC strength and variability between more fine\u2010grained brain regions may be left undetected by our analytic strategy. In addition, we focused on only one aspect of brain dynamics, namely FC variability. Future studies may apply other analytic strategies, such as \u201cbrain state\u201d\u2010based analyses, to gain a more detailed understanding of dynamic FC in ID. The temporal resolution of the fMRI was low. Preprocessing effectively mitigated but could not completely rule out signal contamination by (aliased) physiological noises. In future studies, accelerated fMRI may be adopted, which would more reliably capture brain dynamics at fast time\u2010scales and allow easier separation of physiological noises (LeVan, Akin, & Hennig,  ). \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTERESTS \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nYW, JL: information processing and management; writing; revision of the manuscript.
