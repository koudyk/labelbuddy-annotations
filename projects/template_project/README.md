`<1-2 sentences describing the project>`

## Papers

### How the papers were obtained
Typically with [pubget](https://neuroquery.github.io/pubget/pubget.html).
We recommend invoking `pubget` with the `--query_file` option, and storing a copy of the query file in the project's directory, or including a copy in the `README.md`.

### Where the full papers are stored

Typically on [OSF](https://osf.io/).
Please also add a `documents/datasets.json` file containing the URL where the full `pubget` dataset can be downloaded, that looks like:
```
[
    {
    "url": "https://osf.io/download/<...>/"
    }
]
```
