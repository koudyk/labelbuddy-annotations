In the present fMRI study, we wanted to replicate and extend previous findings on the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying emotion explosiveness and accumulation. Specifically, we aimed to: (a) replicate the finding that different neural mechanisms are associated with emotion explosiveness and accumulation, (b) replicate the finding that adopting a self-distanced (vs. self-immersed) perspective decreases emotion explosiveness and accumulation at the level of self-report, and (c) examine whether adopting a self-distanced (vs. self-immersed) perspective similarly modulates activity in the brain regions associated with emotion explosiveness and accumulation. Participants in an fMRI scanner were asked to adopt a self-immersed or self-distanced perspective while reading and thinking about negative social feedback, and to report on felt changes in negative affect during that period using an emotion intensity profile tracking approach. We replicated previous findings showing that emotion explosiveness and accumulation were related to activity in regions involved in self-referential processing (such as the medial prefrontal cortex) and sustained visceral arousal (such as the posterior insula), respectively. The finding that adopting a self-distanced (vs. self-immersed) perspective lowers emotion explosiveness and accumulation was also replicated at a self-report level. However, perspective taking did not impact activity in the neural correlates of emotion explosiveness and accumulation. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEmotions are dynamic processes that unfold over time. As such, studying the temporal features of emotions is a prerequisite to reach a full understanding of how emotions function [ , ]. Moreover, the fact that many forms of psychopathology (e.g., depression, post-traumatic stress disorder [ ]) are characterized by disturbances in patterns of emotion unfolding only adds to the importance of research on emotion dynamics. \n\nTo study the dynamics of single emotion episodes, Frijda and colleagues [ \u2013 ] developed an intensity profile tracking approach. This approach consists of asking participants to recollect recent emotional episodes and to draw a curve reflecting continuous changes in emotion intensity during each episode. \n\nIn several studies, it has been shown that emotion intensity profiles collected with an intensity profile tracking approach can take a wide range of possible shapes reflecting the inherent complexity of emotion dynamics [ , , , ]. To describe this shape variability, Frijda and colleagues used a number of dynamic features, such as the number of peaks and valleys, the intensity of the highest peak, and the area underneath the curve. However, these features were selected in an ad-hoc fashion. To overcome this limitation, Verduyn and colleagues [ ] wanted to empirically infer dynamic features that would optimally describe variability in emotion intensity profiles. Using dimension reduction techniques, they found that the two features which explained most variability are emotion explosiveness and accumulation [ , , ]. Emotion explosiveness reflects whether the profile has a steep versus a gentle start. Emotion accumulation reflects whether the profile increases over time versus goes back to baseline. To better understand variability in profile shapes, one should not only examine which features optimally describe this variability, but also identify the factors influencing these feature [ ]. \n\nIn a recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, it was found that different neural regions underlie emotion explosiveness and accumulation [ ]. In particular, whereas explosiveness was found to be related to regions involved in self-referential processing such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), accumulation was related to regions underlying sustained visceral arousal such as the posterior insula. These findings are consistent with theoretical claims in the field of emotion dynamics and emotion regulation that emotion onset and offset are partially governed by different processes [ \u2013 ]. However, as the study reported in [ ] was the first attempt to uncover the neural basis of emotion explosiveness and accumulation, it was largely exploratory in nature and its results need to be replicated, which is also in line with recent calls for more replication studies in the field of fMRI [ ]. \n\nA further issue that has been investigated is whether the perspective taken by the emotion-experiencing person may impact the emotion\u2019s explosiveness and accumulation. Previous research has indeed found that one way that people deal with emotional events is by reflecting upon them [ ], and that two types of self-reflection can be distinguished: adopting a self-immersed (i.e., first-person) or a self-distanced (i.e., third-person or external observer) perspective [ \u2013 ]. In contrast to adopting a self-immersed perspective, self-distancing was found to lead individuals to experience decreased levels of emotional and physiological reactivity, intrusive ideation, psychological stress and depressed affects [ \u2013 ]. However, previous research on self-distancing largely disregarded the dimension of time, with a notable exception being a study by Verduyn and colleagues [ ] who found that adopting a self-distanced perspective shortens the duration of emotional experience. However, these authors did not examine the impact of perspective taking on the shape of emotion intensity unfolding. With regard to this issue, R\u00e9sibois and colleagues asked participants in a recent study [ ] to adopt either a self-immersed or a self-distanced perspective while reflecting upon negative social feedback. Adopting a self-distanced perspective was found to lead to reduced levels of both emotion explosiveness and accumulation as compared to adopting a self-immersed perspective. Unfortunately, however, this study only relied on self-report data and did not examine the possible impact of the perspective manipulation on activity in the neural correlates of the two dynamic features underlying the variability in emotion intensity profiles. \n\n### The present study \n  \nThe present study is set up to contribute to our understanding of emotion dynamics by replicating and extending previous findings on emotion explosiveness and accumulation with three specific aims. The first aim is to replicate seminal findings on the neural correlates of emotion explosiveness and accumulation. Consistent with R\u00e9sibois, Verduyn, and colleagues [ ], we expect explosiveness to be related to activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and accumulation to activity in the posterior insula. The second aim is to replicate the previously found effect of perspective taking on emotion explosiveness and accumulation at the level of self-report. Consistent with R\u00e9sibois and colleagues [ ], we expect emotional episodes to be characterized by lower levels of both explosiveness and accumulation when participants adopt a self-distanced versus a self-immersed perspective. The third aim is to examine the possible impact of perspective taking on the neural correlates of emotion explosiveness and accumulation. We expect lower activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (associated with explosiveness) and posterior insula (associated with accumulation) when participants adopt a self-distanced as compared to a self-immersed perspective. \n\nTo test these hypotheses we make use of an fMRI setup in which we induce negative emotions by means of negative social feedback, and ask participants to adopt a self-immersed or self-distanced perspective while reading and thinking about the feedback. Subsequently, we ask them to report on felt changes in emotion intensity using an intensity profile tracking approach. The perspective instructions, feedback form and intensity profile tracking approach were explained during a short task training. Following the procedure used in R\u00e9sibois, Verduyn, and colleagues [ ], non-negative matrix factorization will be used to decompose the collected intensity profiles into an explosiveness and accumulation component, which, in turn, will be used as regressors of the BOLD signal. Next, we will model the effect of the perspective taking manipulation on emotion explosiveness and accumulation at the level of self-report as well as at the level of the neural correlates of the two dynamic features under study. \n\n\n\n## Method \n  \nAll variables collected in the study are mentioned and we report all experimental conditions. \n\n### Sample \n  \nA target number of 40 participants was set prior to the beginning of the study and we slightly oversampled to anticipate participants possibly not showing up at the study. Forty-two French speaking participants (22 females, mean age = 26.45, SD = 7.77, with ages ranging from 18 to 48 years old, all right handed) were thus recruited a month prior to the study through the RISC mailing list of the CNRS (France) that contains more than 10 000 people volunteering to participate in scientific experiments. These 42 participants were screened for any contraindication for MRI such as claustrophobia, metallic prostheses, neurologic or psychiatric illnesses, medication or drugs intake. All participants were found to be eligible and provided written informed consent to participate in the study that took place between May and November 2015. Payment for participation was 45 Euros. A total of ten participants had to be excluded from the analyses due to (a) technical scanner issues (  n   = 2), (b) excessive movement (  n   = 1), (c) disbelief in the cover story (see also funnelled debriefing below,   n   = 6), or (d) being that upset by the feedback that the experiment had to be stopped (  n   = 1). This resulted in a final sample of thirty-two participants (18 females, Mean age = 26.34, SD = 7.67, with ages ranging from 18 to 48 years old). The study was approved by University Paris VI\u2019s institutional review board. \n\n\n### Materials \n  \n#### Social feedback paradigm \n  \nFollowing previous studies [ \u2013 ], negative social feedback was used to induce emotions for two reasons: (a) in daily life emotions are often caused by social stimuli [ , ] and (b) social feedback elicits emotional responses that are long enough to study emotion dynamics [ ]. The social feedback consisted of ratings on desirable (e.g., interesting, honest) and undesirable (e.g., stubborn, superficial) personality traits as well as on an item assessing whether the evaluator would like to have the participant as a friend (an English translation of the original feedback forms is shown in  ). Negative feedback consisted of low (high) ratings on desirable (undesirable) items as well as on the evaluator\u2019s desire to have the participant as a friend. Neutral feedback consisted of ratings close to the neutral scale midpoint of all items. Feedback was shown in one of two pre-specified orders, preventing the presentation of more than two consecutive trials of the same valence (negative or neutral), counterbalanced across participants. \n\n\n#### Perspective taking instructions \n  \nParticipants were asked to adopt a self-distanced or self-immersed perspective when reading and thinking about the feedback. In the self-distanced perspective condition, participants were instructed to \u201c  read and think about the feedback while adopting a detached attitude with regard to this feedback  ,   as if you were an impartial observer  ,   a scientist who analyses the feedback objectively  \u201d. In the self-immersed perspective condition, participants were instructed to \u201c  read and think about the feedback while concentrating on what it implies for you as a person  ,   on what are the specific feelings you are experiencing subjectively at this feedback  \u201d. These instructions were modelled after previous studies manipulating immersed versus distanced perspective taking [ , ]. \n\n\n#### Emotion intensity profile tracking approach \n  \nImmediately after exposure to social feedback, participants drew with a trackball a profile reflecting continuous changes in the intensity of negative affect during the period that they read and thought about the feedback. For this purpose, a two-dimensional grid was displayed on the screen. The   X  -axis represented time and was proportionally divided into two parts corresponding to the period during which participants read (30s) and reflected upon the feedback (60s). The   Y  -axis represented the intensity of negative affect and was divided into seven intervals ranging from \u2018none\u2019 to \u2018very high\u2019. The intensity labels on the   Y  -axis were identical for self-immersed and self-distanced trials. \n\n\n#### Task training \n  \nTo explain participants what the social feedback would look like, ensure that they understood the perspective instructions, and familiarize them with reporting on emotion unfolding using the emotion intensity profile tracking approach, participants were walked through each screen of a practice feedback trial. First, the experimenter clarified the meaning of a self-immersed and a self-distanced perspective and answered any possible questions participants had on these constructs. Next, the items constituting the social feedback were explained using a blank feedback form, and participants were reminded that they had to read the social feedback while adopting the instructed perspective. Then, participants were explained that they had to continue to think about the feedback adopting the instructed perspective as long as a fixation cross appeared on the screen. Finally, the emotion intensity profile tracking approach was explained and participants practiced until they felt capable of drawing emotion intensity profiles. \n\n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nThe experiment was divided in four phases. In phase 1 (20 min), participants wrote four brief texts on personal topics such as \u201cDescribe what is most important in your life\u201d. Participants were made to believe that these texts would be read by five evaluators who would use the texts to assess participants\u2019 personality. In reality, no evaluators were involved and all participants received the same feedback. To further strengthen the cover story, participants were told that the supposed evaluators would be misled themselves into thinking that each essay had been written by a different participant, supposedly allowing the experimenter to assess the stability of first impressions. \n\nIn phase 2 (20 min), participants completed several questionnaires assessing personality traits, emotion regulation dispositions, and well-being indicators. As these are not directly relevant for our research questions, they will be left aside in the remainder of the manuscript. \n\nIn phase 3 (50 min), after a short training, participants entered into the MRI scanner and were exposed to social feedback across two runs consisting of 10 trials each (see   for a visual representation of the structure of a trial). At the start of each run, participants were instructed to adopt a self-distanced or self-immersed perspective (manipulated within participants with the order of perspectives counterbalanced across participants). Both conditions thus consisted of the same number of trials (10 each). \n   Time course of trials (in seconds).  \nEach trial started with a screen announcing that feedback was about to be shown and reminded participants which perspective (self-immersed or self-distanced) to adopt (Instruct). Subsequently, while adopting the instructed perspective, participants had to read one of the negative (six trials per run) or neutral (four trials per run) feedback that was presented (Feedback), and to think about it while adopting the instructed perspective as long as a fixation cross appeared on the screen (Fixation cross). Immediately afterwards, they were asked to draw an intensity profile reflecting the changes in negative affect they experienced while reading and thinking about the feedback using the emotion intensity profile tracking approach (Drawing). To reduce carryover effects, participants were asked to relax before a new trial started (Relax). sp = self-paced. \n  \nFinally, in phase 4 (10 min), participants went through a funnelled debriefing consisting of several questions that offered plenty of opportunities to the participants to express any suspicion they may have had about the veracity of the cover story (for the full list of questions, see  ). The funnelled debriefing was followed by a full debriefing revealing the true purpose of the experiment. \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nStimuli were generated and presented with E-Prime 2.0 and projected on a Plexiglas screen mounted at the end of the scanner bore. Two functional runs were acquired on a 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma  Tim MR-scanner VD 13 (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) with Siemens standard 32-channel head coil. Participants\u2019 head movements were restrained by foam paddings inside of the head coil. Functional images covering the whole brain were acquired using a T2*-weighted gradient echo, echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence, sensitive to blood oxygen level-dependent signal, employing the following parameters: repetition time: 2040ms, echo time: 27ms, flip angle: 78\u00b0, bandwidth: 2444Hz, matrix: 66\u00d766, field of view: 19.8\u00d719.8cm , GRAPPA acceleration factor: 2. Forty sequential axial slices, with an isotropic voxel size of 3\u00d73\u00d73mm , were acquired parallel to the anteroposterior commissure plane. Each run lasted between 1240s and 1838s (mean = 1395s, SD = 107), resulting in between 608 and 901 images (mean = 684 images, SD = 53) depending on the time participants took to draw emotion intensity profiles. Additional \"dummy\u201d volumes were acquired at the beginning of each run to allow the magnetization to stabilize to a steady state before the first real volume. High-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted sagittal images (3D fast gradient echo inversion recovery sequence, inversion time: 900ms, repetition time: 2300ms, echo time: 2.96ms, bandwidth: 240Hz, flip angle: 9\u00b0, matrix: 256\u00d7248, field of view: 25.6\u00d725.6cm , voxel size: 1\u00d71\u00d71mm\u00b3, GRAPPA acceleration factor: 2) were acquired for anatomical localization. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nWhereas the first author as well as two co-authors were involved in the analysis of the original dataset [ ], only one of them analysed the present dataset. \n\n#### Delineating emotion explosiveness and accumulation \n  \nConsistent with R\u00e9sibois, Verduyn, and colleagues [ ], each of the obtained 384 self-reported intensity profiles following negative feedback was first transformed into a function using the linear interpolation function (interp1) implemented in MATLAB R2016b [ ] and then discretised into 44 equally distanced time points, corresponding to the number of images acquired during the period that participants read and thought about the feedback. These time series were subsequently decomposed into two components using non-negative matrix factorization [ ] (as implemented in MATLAB R2016b [ ]). The resulting component loadings depict the dynamic features of the shape of component profiles, whereas the resulting component scores depict the extent to which each intensity profile is characterized by each of these dynamic features. \n\nAs illustrated in   (top panel), the first obtained component has initial high loadings followed by a steep decrease, whereas the second obtained component has loadings that increase over time. To interpret these components [ ], reconstructed profiles taking low (i.e., 10  percentile), average, and high (i.e., 90  percentile) scores on one component and mean scores on the other component were constructed (see  , bottom panel). The first component corresponds to emotion explosiveness, with emotion intensity having either a gentle (10  percentile) or an explosive (90  percentile) start. The second component corresponds to emotion accumulation, with emotion intensity either returning to baseline (10  percentile) or accumulating (90  percentile) over time. Reconstructed profiles taking low, average and high scores on one component and mean scores on the other component, separately for each perspective taking condition are available in  . \n   Two-component solution resulting from NNMF.  \nYellow (left) and green (right) backgrounds correspond to reading and thinking about the feedback, respectively. Top: Component loadings of emotional intensity profiles over time. Bottom: Reconstructed profiles taking a high (90  percentile), average, or low (10  percentile) score on the component in question and a mean score on the other component, presented according to the order of their peaks in the temporal process. This figure is based on data obtained in both self-immersed and self-distanced trials. Bottom left panel: High and low scoring profiles show an explosive and gentle start, respectively. Bottom right panel: High and low scoring profiles show emotion accumulation and recovery, respectively. \n  \nEach intensity profile can thus be reconstructed by summing the component scores multiplied by their corresponding loadings (i.e., adding reconstructed subprofiles). A visualization of the decomposition of intensity profiles into their reconstructed subprofiles is shown in  . \n   Original drawings (upper panel), explosiveness subprofiles (middle panel) and accumulation subprofiles (lower panel).  \nAdding the reconstructed subprofiles closely approximates the original intensity profile. Yellow (left) and green (right) backgrounds correspond to reading and thinking about the feedback, respectively. \n  \n\n#### Pre-processing of brain images \n  \nFunctional scans were pre-processed with SPM8 [ ], using slice-time correction, motion correction, spatial normalization to the MNI space, and spatial smoothing using a 8-mm full-width at half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel. Spatial normalization was performed by first co-registering the high resolution T1-weighted image to the mean functional image, normalizing the T1 to the MNI template, and applying the normalization parameters to the functional images. \n\n\n#### General linear model construction \n  \nStatistical analyses were conducted using the general linear model (GLM) framework implemented in SPM8 [ ]. For each run, boxcar regressors were used to represent the first screen displaying the self-perspective instruction (self-paced). For each trial within each run, boxcar regressors were also used to represent: (a) the five-second screen notifying participants of the forthcoming feedback and reminding them of the perspective to take, (b) the ninety-second period during which participants read and thought about the manipulated negative feedback, (c) the ninety-second period during which participants read and thought about the manipulated neutral feedback, and (d) the self-paced emotion intensity profile drawing period, with the relaxation period functioning as an implicit baseline. All regressors were convolved with the canonical haemodynamic response function. Similar to R\u00e9sibois, Verduyn, and colleagues [ ], a high-pass filter of 200s was applied, and the motion realignment parameters were included as regressors of non-interest. \n\n\n#### Neural correlates of emotion intensity profile features \n  \nTo examine the neural basis of emotion explosiveness and accumulation, we further added the reconstructed subprofiles derived from the non-negative matrix factorization (as depicted in  ), convolved with the haemodynamic response function, to the regression equation of the GLM presented above. This model was used to predict the BOLD signal both in a number of regions of interest and at the voxel level, and this across the two perspectives. \n\nTwo series of region of interest analysis were conducted to try to replicate earlier results on the neural correlates of emotion explosiveness and accumulation. Specifically, as replicating our previous findings was one of the key motivations for this study, in the first series of region of interest analysis we used two   global   regions of interest that comprised all clusters that were found to be related with emotion explosiveness (resp. emotion accumulation) in the study by R\u00e9sibois, Verduyn and colleagues [ ]. The first region of interest with all clusters found to be related with emotion explosiveness comprised the left mPFC, the left middle and superior frontal and temporal gyri, the left supramarginal gyrus, the right angular, superior temporal, lingual, and middle occipital gyri, and the right cerebellum. The second region of interest with all clusters found to be related with emotion accumulation comprised the bilateral insula (mid-posterior part) and cingulate cortex (mid-posterior part), the right claustrum and anterior cingulate cortex (dorsal part), the left middle frontal (dorsolateral part of the prefrontal cortex), pre/post-central, and superior temporal gyri, the left caudate body, and inferior parietal lobule. These were created by first saving all SPM-8\u2019s clusters from the result table of explosiveness (resp. accumulation) as a binary image, and transforming it into a ROI using the SPM8-compatible tool MarsBar [ ]. In the second series, we used the two   specific   regions of interest found by R\u00e9sibois, Verduyn and colleagues [ ] to be correlated with emotion explosiveness and accumulation, respectively (i.e., the mPFC and insula, respectively). The mPFC and insula were bilaterally defined using AAL\u2019s [ ] entire structural masks included in the SPM8-compatible tool MarsBar [ ], with the insula being divided into an anterior (y > -10) and posterior (y < -10) sub-region [ ]. For each region of interest, we calculated the mean value of the second-level explosiveness and accumulation BOLD regression weights by aggregating across all of their voxels, and tested for significance by means of one sample t-tests with Bonferroni correction. \n\nIn addition, voxelwise whole brain analyses were conducted to explore possible additional correlates of emotion explosiveness and accumulation. Specifically, we created statistical parametric maps for each participant and entered those into random-effects group analyses testing for significance using one sample   t  -tests. Similar to R\u00e9sibois, Verduyn, and colleagues [ ], statistical parametric maps were thresholded at   p  <.001 (uncorrected) combined with an extend threshold of 10 adjacent voxels, which balances Type I and Type II error rates [ , ]. To test the robustness of our findings, we also provide FWER cluster-corrected and FDR voxelwise-corrected   p  -values. Resulting peaks were transformed into the Talairach space using the SPM8-compatible tool icbm2tal [ , ] and labelled using the Talairach atlas [ , ]. \n\n\n#### The effect of perspective taking on emotion explosiveness and accumulation at the self-report level \n  \nTo examine the effect of the perspective taking manipulation on emotion explosiveness and accumulation, we ran multilevel analyses using the nlme package [ ] developed for R [ ]. In particular, the two non-negative matrix factorization scores (i.e., explosiveness and accumulation) were predicted by a dummy predictor (0 = self-immersion, 1 = self-distancing) at Level 1. The intercept and slope were allowed to vary randomly across participants. \n\n\n#### The effect of perspective taking on the neural correlates of emotion explosiveness and accumulation \n  \nTo examine whether perspective taking impacts activity in the neural correlates of emotion explosiveness and accumulation, two contrasts were created based on the parameters obtained from fitting the general linear model described above without the reconstructed subprofiles (i.e., only containing boxcar regressors). The contrasts compared neural activity during the period that participants adopted a self-distanced (SD) perspective to the period that participants adopted a self-immersed (SI) perspective and vice versa. Both contrasts were examined at the level of region of interests as well as voxels across the whole brain. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Neural correlates of emotion intensity profile features \n  \nThe two reconstructed subprofiles (i.e., component loadings multiplied by component scores, see  ) of explosiveness and accumulation (convolved with the canonical haemodynamic response function) were used as regressors of the BOLD response across the two conditions. First, we examined whether we could replicate the findings of R\u00e9sibois, Verduyn and colleagues [ ] by conducting region of interest analyses. Next, we explored possible additional neural correlates by conducting voxelwise whole brain analyses. It is notable that the neural correlates of explosiveness and accumulation did not depend on the type of self-perspective adopted. Indeed, contrasts comparing the neural correlates of explosiveness (accumulation) while adopting a self-distanced perspective to the neural correlates of explosiveness (accumulation) while adopting a self-immersed perspective were not significant, regardless of whether conducting voxelwise whole-brain analysis or region of interest analyses. \n\nIn a first series of region of interest analyses we examined whether the current explosiveness and accumulation regressors were predictive of neural activity in the   global   regions of interest that comprised all clusters identified by R\u00e9sibois, Verduyn and colleagues [ ] to be associated with emotion explosiveness and accumulation, respectively. This was found to be the case (see  ). \n   Region of interest analyses predicting neural activity in the full set of clusters observed by R\u00e9sibois, Verduyn & colleagues [ ] to be correlated with emotion explosiveness (resp. accumulation).        \nIn a second series of region of interest analyses we examined whether the explosiveness and accumulation regressors were predictive of neural activity in the   specific   regions identified by Resibois, Verduyn and colleagues [ ] to be associated with emotion explosiveness (mPFC) and accumulation (posterior insula), respectively. This was found to be the case (see  ). \n   Region of interest analyses predicting neural activity in the   specific   regions observed by Resibois, Verduyn & colleagues [ ] to underlie emotion explosiveness (resp. accumulation).        \nFinally, in line with previous findings [ ], voxelwise whole brain analyses revealed that emotion explosiveness is related to activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, the bilateral middle frontal and superior temporal gyri, the left middle temporal gyrus, and the right middle occipital gyrus. However, a number of regions were additionally identified with explosiveness also being related to activity in left inferior and right frontal gyri, the right middle temporal gyrus, the left precentral, middle occipital, and lingual gyri, the bilateral cuneus, and the right precuneus (See   and  ). \n   Activations associated with explosiveness in whole-brain analysis.

Coordinates in the Talairach space. \n  \nLikewise, in line with previous findings [ ], exploratory voxelwise whole brain analyses revealed that emotion accumulation is related to activity in the bilateral posterior insula, the left precentral, cingulate, middle frontal and superior temporal gyri, the left caudate body, and the right claustrum. However, a number of regions were additionally identified with accumulation also being related to activity in the left middle temporal, anterior cingulate, superior and medial frontal gyri, the left precuneus, the right paracentral lobule and caudate tail, the right middle and superior temporal gyri, and the bilateral angular gyri (See   and  ). \n   Activations associated with accumulation in whole-brain analysis.        \n\n### The effect of perspective taking on emotion explosiveness and accumulation at the self-report level \n  \nMultilevel analysis was used to predict emotion explosiveness and accumulation scores by the perspective taking manipulation (0 = self-immersed, 1 = self-distanced). Both explosiveness (B = -174.88, \u03b2 = -.34, t(351) = -3.79, p < .001, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-265.70, -84.05]) and accumulation (B = -301.46, \u03b2 = -.33, t(351) = -3.35, p < .001, 95% CI [-478.65, -124.26]) were found to be lower when participants adopted a self-distanced perspective. The manipulation order was not related to either explosiveness (p = .28) or accumulation (p = .97), nor did controlling for the manipulation order alter any of the reported conclusions. \n\n\n### The effect of perspective taking on the neural correlates of emotion explosiveness and accumulation \n  \nAdopting a self-distanced (vs. self-immersed) perspective did not lead (see  ) to altered levels of activity in the mPFC (associated with explosiveness) or in the insula (associated with accumulation). Additional exploratory voxelwise whole-brain analyses similarly did not reveal differential neural activity depending on the self-perspective adopted. An alternative strategy to examine the neural activity associated with adopting a self-distanced (SD) versus a self-immersed (SI) perspective would be to use the neutral trials of the corresponding run as reference categories as reflected by the following two contrasts: (1) [negative trials > neutral trials]  > [negative trials > neutral trials]  and (2) [negative trials > neutral trials]  < [negative trials > neutral trials] . Yet, similar to the analyses reported above, this did not lead to any significant result in region of interest or in whole brain analyses. \n   Regions of interest analyses comparing activity while adopting a self-distanced vs. self-immersed perspective when exposed to negative feedback.        \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe overall aim of the present study was to replicate and extend previous results on the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying emotion explosiveness and accumulation. First of all and importantly, our findings provided an independent replication of the existence of distinctive correlates of emotion explosiveness and emotion accumulation with data being acquired by another experimenter and using another fMRI scanner than in the study of R\u00e9sibois, Verduyn, and colleagues [ ]. Specifically, in the two series of region of interest analyses and in the voxelwise whole brain analyses, emotion explosiveness appeared again to be associated with regions of self-referential processing (such as the medial prefrontal cortex), whereas emotion accumulation appeared again to be associated with regions of sustained monitoring of visceral arousal and the sensory component of social exclusion (such as the posterior insula). These findings corroborate that onset- and offset-bound processes have distinct neural correlates, which is consistent with emotion dynamic frameworks distinguishing between two key emotion unfolding phases [ \u2013 , ]: an onset phase (associated with explosiveness) and an offset phase (associated with accumulation), which were found in the present study to be the two main constituents underlying change in emotional experience over time. It further emphasizes the need to take temporal dynamics into account when studying the neural basis of emotions, which resonates with recent calls to put time on the research agenda of affective neuroscience [ \u2013 ]. \n\nProviding further evidence for an association between emotion explosiveness and self-referential processing, in the current study explosiveness was additionally found to be associated with activity in the precuneus and the temporo-parietal junction, which are two regions of the default-mode network [ \u2013 ]. Moreover, as further evidence for an association between emotion accumulation and sustained monitoring of visceral arousal, emotion accumulation additionally appeared to be associated with activity in the primary sensory cortex [ , , ]. In addition, emotion accumulation was also associated with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, providing suggestive evidence for the social feedback having resulted in feelings of social exclusion, even though it should be noted that no significant activity in the anterior insula was observed [ ]. However, future studies using non-social or more basic emotion-eliciting stimuli (e.g., emotional pictures as used in [ ]) are needed to examine the degree to which the neural correlates of explosiveness and accumulation generalize across contexts. It is possible that studies using such more basic stimuli would identify primary emotion areas such as the amygdala or the anterior insula as key neural correlates of emotion explosiveness and accumulation [ \u2013 ]. This is especially likely given the negative association found in the literature between meaning making regions (associated with explosiveness in the present study), and the anterior insula and amygdala [ ]. Yet, one could alternatively argue that activity in the anterior insula and amygdala is perhaps associated with emotion intensity per se regardless of the stage of emotion unfolding (i.e., overall levels of intensity rather than specific dynamic features) as found in previous research using emotional movies to induce emotion [ , ]. However, it is notable that, in the present study where we used complex social stimuli, we did not find an effect of our manipulation on any primary emotion areas despite that self-distancing was found to overall lower self-reported emotion intensity. \n\nSecond, we indeed replicated that adopting a self-distanced (vs. a self-immersed) perspective decreases both emotion explosiveness and accumulation (i.e., lowering overall emotion intensity). This demonstrates that perspective taking can modulate how people initially react to emotional stimuli, at least when being instructed to use this regulation strategy beforehand. Moreover, it suggests support to psychological therapies that provide people the tools to take distance, including cognitive-behavioural, acceptance-based, and mindfulness therapies [ ], such that they may be better equipped to deal with potential future stressors. However, future research including clinical populations and using stimuli eliciting higher degrees of distress are necessary to justify this conjecture. \n\nThird, unexpectedly, adopting a self-distanced (vs. a self-immersed) perspective did not lead to altered levels of activity in the mPFC (associated with explosiveness) or in the insula (associated with accumulation). Although it is difficult to interpret null findings, one could at least speculate that this result might be due to the fact that perspective taking may recruit regions that are also correlated with emotion explosiveness and accumulation, cancelling out the possibility of finding a significant decrease of activity in these regions when adopting a self-distanced (vs. a self-immersed) perspective. This tentative explanation could be especially plausible to at least partially explain why adopting a self-distanced perspective was not found to be associated with a decreased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (associated with explosiveness), as this region has been consistently found to underlie processes of reappraisal [ \u2013 ], including perspective taking [ , ]. This interpretation might especially hold given the use of social feedback as an emotion-eliciting stimulus. The predictive and reactive control systems (PARCS) framework [ ] indeed theorizes that regions of the predictive system, including the DMN, underlie both (a) adopting an observer perspective and (b) making meaning of negative feedback that challenges internal models about oneself and the world. Thus, future studies might benefit from using emotional stimuli that do not require extensive self-referential processing (e.g., emotional pictures) to further explore the role of perspective taking on the neural correlates of explosiveness and accumulation. \n\nFinally, although intensity levels reported in the present study are similar to other studies using a negative feedback procedure [ , , , ], future research eliciting stronger emotions are needed to get a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying emotion dynamics. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6219793, "text_md5": "a1dc8293c38132714ca27adf068b182b", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 145], "journal": [146, 154], "publication_year": [156, 160], "title": [171, 257], "keywords": [271, 271], "abstract": [284, 2003], "body": [2012, 40808]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 30399153, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0206889", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6219793", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6219793"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6219793\">6219793</a>", "list_title": "PMC6219793  The impact of self-distancing on emotion explosiveness and accumulation: An fMRI study"}
{"text": "H\u00e4usler, Christian O. and Eickhoff, Simon B. and Hanke, Michael\nSci Data, 2022\n\n# Title\n\nProcessing of visual and non-visual naturalistic spatial information in the \"parahippocampal place area\"\n\n# Keywords\n\nPerception\nLanguage\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nThe \u201cparahippocampal place area\u201d (PPA) in the human ventral visual stream exhibits increased hemodynamic activity correlated with the perception of landscape photos compared to faces or objects. Here, we investigate the perception of scene-related, spatial information embedded in two naturalistic stimuli. The same 14 participants were watching a Hollywood movie and listening to its audio-description as part of the open-data resource   studyforrest.org  . We model hemodynamic activity based on annotations of selected stimulus features, and compare results to a block-design visual localizer. On a group level, increased activation correlating with visual spatial information occurring in the movie is overlapping with a traditionally localized PPA. Activation correlating with semantic spatial information occurring in the audio-description is more restricted to the anterior PPA. On an individual level, we find significant bilateral activity in the PPA of nine individuals and unilateral activity in one individual. Results suggest that activation in the PPA generalizes to spatial information embedded in a movie and an auditory narrative, and may call for considering a functional subdivision of the PPA. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nStudies in the field of neuropsychology and neuroimaging (e.g., ) have shown that different parts of the brain are specialized for different perceptual and cognitive functions. The occipital cortex is considered to be primarily involved in the early stages of visual perception and giving rise to two distinct, but interacting, pathways that serve different functions: a) a dorsal stream (the \u201chow pathway\u201d) that leads into the parietal lobe and supports visual guidance of action, and b) a ventral stream (the \u201cwhat pathway\u201d) that leads into the temporal lobe and supports conscious perception and recognition . A classic example of a higher-level visual area in the ventral pathway is the \u201cparahippocampal place area\u201d (PPA) . The PPA is located in the posterior parahippocampal gyrus including adjacent regions of the fusiform gyrus and anterior lingual gyrus . Increased hemodynamic activity is observed in the PPA when participants view pictures of landscapes, buildings or landmarks, compared to, e.g., pictures of faces or tools, during blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) (see reviews ). \n\nIncreased hemodynamic activity in the PPA generalizes from pictures to mental imagery of landscapes , haptic exploration of scenes constructed from LEGO blocks , and scene-related sounds . In a study conducted by O\u2019Craven and Kanwisher  participants viewed alternating blocks of pictures showing familiar places and famous faces during an initial experimental paradigm. In a subsequent paradigm, participants were instructed to \u201cform a vivid mental image\u201d of the previously viewed pictures. The PPA showed increased activation during imagination of places compared to faces but the imagination task showed a smaller activation level compared to the perceptual task. In a block design study conducted by Wolbers   et al  .  the PPA of sighted as well as blind participants showed increased activation during a delayed match-to-sample task of haptically explored scenes constructed from LEGO bricks compared to abstract geometric objects. \n\nTo our knowledge only one study  compared hemodynamic activity levels in the PPA that were correlated with different semantic categories occurring in   speech  . Aziz-Zadeh   et al  .  used sentences that described famous or generic places, faces, or objects. Participants were instructed to press a button whenever the sentence described an inaccurate or improbable fact (e.g., \u201cMarilyn Monroe has a large square jaw\u201d). Activation in the left, but not right, PPA was significantly reduced when participants listened to place-related sentences compared to listening to face-related sentences. Moreover, this effect was only observed in sentences involving famous places. \n\nTaken together, the literature suggests that the PPA does not exclusively respond to visually presented scene-related, spatial information. However, all reviewed studies share three common aspects: 1) they employed a small set of carefully chosen and conceptualized stimuli, 2) they exclusively used a block-design paradigm, and 3) they employed an explicit (perceptual) judgement task. Block-design studies that use conceptualized stimuli and a task have the advantage of controlling confounding variables (e.g., color, luminance, size, spatial frequencies, sentence length), maximizing detection power, and keeping participants paying attention to the stimuli. Nevertheless, small sets of conceptualized stimuli and block-design paradigms lack external and ecological validity  because they poorly resemble how we, free of an explicit perceptual task, experience our rich, multidimensional and continuous environment that our brains are accommodated to . \n\nIn this study, we investigate whether increased hemodynamic activity in the PPA that is usually detected by contrasting blocks of pictures is also present under more natural conditions. To answer this question, we operationalized the perception of both   visual and auditory   spatial information using two naturalistic stimuli (see reviews ). The current operationalization of visual spatial perception is based on an annotation of cuts and depicted locations in the audio-visual movie \u201cForrest Gump\u201d , while the operationalization of non-visual spatial perception is based on an annotation of speech occurring in the movie\u2019s audio-description . The movie stimulus shares the stimulation in the visual domain with classical localizer stimuli, while featuring real-life-like visual complexity and naturalistic auditory stimulation. The audio-description maintains the naturalistic nature of the movie stimulus, but limited to the auditory domain. We applied model-based, mass-univariate analyses to BOLD fMRI data from both naturalistic stimuli , available from the open-data resource  . We compare current results to results of a previously performed model-based, mass-univariate analysis that was applied to data from a conventional functional localizer performed with the same set of participants . Similarly to the functional localizer, we currently also capitalize on events that ought to evoke the cognitive processing of spatial information. Thus, we hypothesized that our whole-brain analyses would reveal increased hemodynamic activity in medial temporal regions that were functionally identified as the PPA by the analysis of the localizer data. We hypothesized further that a purely auditory stimulus could, in principle, localize the PPA as an example of a \u201cvisual area\u201d in individual persons, and may offer an alternative paradigm to assess brain functions in visually impaired individuals. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe investigated if spatial information embedded in two naturalistic stimuli correlates with increased hemodynamic activity in the PPA. Based on an annotation of cuts in the movie and an annotation of speech spoken by the audio-description\u2019s narrator, we selected events in both stimuli that should correlate with the perception of spatial information and contrasted them with events that should correlate with non-spatial perception to a lesser degree, or not at all. In order to test the robustness of our approach, we created multiple linear model (GLM)   t  -contrasts for the movie and audio-description. For each stimulus, we chose a primary contrast for result presentation based on a subjectively assessed balance of how well the averaged events within categories represent spatial and non-spatial information, and the number of events in the stimulus. On a group average level, we report results from whole-brain analyses of the movie\u2019s and the audio-description\u2019s primary contrasts and compare these results to a traditional visual localizer . For each individual, we also compare the activation pattern from naturalistic auditory stimulation to the individual PPA localization with a block-design stimulus (see Figure\u00a0  in the\u00a0  for additional surface plots). An evaluation of the results\u2019 robustness across all created contrasts on a group average level is provided in the\u00a0  (see Figure\u00a0 ). Unthresholded   Z  -maps of all contrasts on a group average level as well as individual results of the primary   t  -contrasts co-registered to the group-template (MNI152 space) can be found at  . \n\n### Group analyses \n  \nFirst, we analyzed data from the movie that offered ecologically more valid visual stimulation than a paradigm using blocks of pictures. The movie\u2019s primary   t  -contrast that compared cuts to a setting that was not depicted before to cuts within a recurring setting (vse_new\u2009>\u2009vpe_old) yielded three significant clusters (see Table\u00a0 ). Results are depicted as slices of brain volumes in Fig.\u00a0 ). The surface plots depicted in Fig.\u00a0 ) were created by reconstructing the cortical surface of the MNI152 template using   v7.1.1 , and projecting the   Z  -maps onto the surface using FreeSurfer\u2019s\u2019mri_vol2surf\u2019 command. One cluster spans across the midline and comprises parts of the intracalcarine and cuneal cortex, the lingual gyrus and retrosplenial cortex, the occipital and temporal fusiform gyrus, and the parahippocampal cortex (reported from posterior to anterior) in both hemispheres. Two additional bilateral clusters are located in the superior lateral occipital cortex.   \nClusters (  Z  -threshold   Z   > 3.4;   p   < 0.05, cluster-corrected) of the primary   t  -contrast for the audio-visual movie comparing cuts to a setting depicted for the first time with cuts within a recurring setting (vse_new\u2009>\u2009vpe_old), sorted by size. \n  \nThe first brain structure given contains the voxel with the maximum   Z  -value, followed by brain structures from posterior to anterior, and partially covered areas (l.: left; r: right; c.: cortex; g.: gyrus; CoG: Center of Gravity). \n    \nMixed-effects group-level (N = 14) clusters (  Z   > 3.4;   p   < 0.05, cluster-corrected) of activity correlated with the processing of spatial information. The results of the audio-description\u2019s primary   t  -contrast (blue) that compares geometry-related nouns spoken by the narrator to non-spatial nouns (geo, groom\u2009>\u2009all non-spatial categories) are overlaid on the movie\u2019s primary   t  -contrast (red) that compares cuts to a setting depicted for the first time to cuts within a recurring setting (vse_new\u2009>\u2009vpe_old). (  a  ) results as brain slices on top of the MNI152 T1-weighted head template, with the acquisition field-of-view for the audio-description study highlighted. For comparison depicted as a black outline, the union of the individual PPA localizations reported by Sengupta   et al  .  that was spatially smoothed by applying a Gaussian kernel with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 2.0\u2009mm. (  b  ) results projected onto the reconstructed surface of the MNI152 T1-weighted brain template. After projection, the union of individual PPA localizations was spatially smoothed by a Gaussian kernel with FWHM of 2.0\u2009mm. \n  \n\nSecond, we analyzed data from the audio-description offering an exclusively auditory stimulation. The primary   t  -contrast for the audio-description (geo, groom\u2009>\u2009non-spatial noun categories) yielded six significant clusters (see Table\u00a0 , Fig.\u00a0 ). Two bilateral clusters are located in the anterior part of the PPA group overlap reported by Sengupta   et al  . . Specifically, these clusters are located at the borders of the posterior parahippocampal cortex, the occipital and temporal fusiform gyrus and lingual gyrus. Two additional bilateral clusters are apparent in the ventral precuneus extending into the retrosplenial cortex. Finally, two bilateral clusters are located in the superior lateral occipital cortex.   \nClusters (  Z  -threshold   Z   > 3.4;   p   < 0.05, cluster-corrected) of the primary   t  -contrast for the audio-description comparing geometry-related nouns to non-spatial nouns spoken by the audio-description\u2019s narrator (geo,\u2009groom\u2009>\u2009all non-geo), sorted by size. \n  \nThe first brain structure given contains the voxel with the maximum   Z  -value, followed by brain structures from posterior to anterior, and partially covered areas (l.: left; r: right; c.: cortex; g.: gyrus; CoG: Center of Gravity). \n  \n\n\n### Individual analyses \n  \nThird, we inspected results from both naturalistic paradigms on the level of individual participants, and compared them to the individual PPA localizations provided by Sengupta   et al  . , who reported bilateral parahippocampal clusters in 12 of 14 participants and unilateral right clusters in two participants (see Table\u00a03 in ). Unlike Sengupta   et al  . , who determined PPA clusters using three candidate contrasts and a variable threshold, we used a single contrast for each naturalistic stimulus and a uniform threshold for all participants. Figure\u00a0  depicts thresholded   Z  -maps of the primary movie and audio-description   t  -contrasts, in comparison to the results of a conventional block-design localizer (see Figure\u00a0  in the\u00a0  for surface plots; unthresholded   Z  -maps are provided at  ). Results of the primary movie contrast yielded bilateral clusters in five participants, a unilateral right cluster in six participants (of which one participant yielded a unilateral cluster in the visual localizer), and a unilateral left cluster in one participant. We find bilateral clusters for participant sub-20, whereas the block-design localizer yielded only one cluster in the right hemisphere. Results of the primary audio-description contrast yielded bilateral clusters in nine participants that are within or overlapping with the block-design localizer results. In participant sub-04, two bilateral clusters are apparent, whereas block-design localizer, and movie stimulus yielded only one cluster in the right hemisphere. For another participant (sub-09) the analysis yielded one cluster in the left-hemispheric PPA.   \nOverview of event categories of the audio-visual movie and the audio-description. \n  \nEvent categories of the movie are based on an annotation of cuts and depicted locations. Event categories of the audio-description are based on an annotation of nouns spoken by the audio-description\u2019s narrator (see Table\u00a0 ). Some of the audio-description\u2019s event categories listed here (sex_f; sex_m; fahead, object) were created by pooling some categories of the original annotation of nouns (female, females, fname; male, males, mname; face, head; object, objects). Respective event counts are given for the whole stimulus (All) and the segments that were used for the eight sessions of fMRI scanning. Event counts for frame-based features are reported in units of a thousand. \n    \nFixed-effects individual-level GLM results (  Z   > 3.4;   p   < 0.05, cluster-corrected). Individual brains are aligned via non-linear transformation to a study-specific T2* group template that is co-registered to the MNI152 template with an affine transformation (12 degrees of freedom). The results of the audio-description\u2019s primary   t  -contrast (blue) that compares geometry related nouns to non-geometry related nouns spoken by the narrator (geo, groom\u2009>\u2009all non-geo) are overlaid over the movie\u2019s primary   t  -contrast (red) that compares cuts to a setting depicted for the first time with cuts within a recurring setting (vse_new\u2009>\u2009vpe_old). Black: outline of participant-specific PPA(s) reported by Sengupta   et al  . . Light gray: The audio-description\u2019s field of view . To facilitate comparisons across participants, we chose the same horizontal slice (x = \u221211) for all participants as this slice depicts voxels of significant clusters in almost all participants. The figure does not show voxels of the left cluster of the movie stimulus in sub-09 and sub-18, and voxels of the right cluster of the movie stimulus in sub-15. \n  \n\nTo illustrate the similarity of correlates of spatial processing in naturalistic (audio-description) and conventional stimulation, independent of a particular cluster-forming threshold, Bland-Altman plots for all participants are shown in Fig.\u00a0 . Each subplot visualizes the mean value and difference (localizer minus audio-description) of all voxels in temporal and occipital cortices. The marginal distributions of the mean scores indicate a general agreement of both contrast scores across voxels in the PPA localization overlap as a probabilistic indicator (blue), and the individual block-design localizer results (red). Notably, 11 participants exhibit a pattern of increased   Z  -scores for the naturalistic stimulus (lower right quadrant) that includes voxels labeled by the block-design localizer, but also additional voxels.   \nBland-Altman-Plots for individual participants. The x-axes show the means of two spatially corresponding voxels in the unthresholded   Z  -map of the audio-description\u2019s primary contrast and unthresholded   Z  -map of the visual localizer (KDE plot on the top). The y-axes show the difference of two voxels (localizer minus audio-description; KDE plot on the right). The overlays depict voxels spatially constrained to the temporal and occipital cortex (gray; based on probabilistic J\u00fclich Histological Atlas ), PPA overlap of all participants (blue), and individual PPA(s) (red). \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nSeveral studies have reported increased hemodynamic activity in the PPA attributed to the processing of scene-related, spatial information, for example, when participants were watching static pictures of landscapes compared to pictures of faces or objects . However, reports regarding the correlates of processing spatial information in verbal stimulation are less clear . In line with previous studies, we investigated the hemodynamic response to spatial information using a model-based, mass-univariate approach. However, instead of using a conventional set of stimuli, assembled to specifically and predominantly evoke the processing of spatial information, we employed naturalistic stimuli, a movie and its audio-description, that were designed for entertainment. \n\nWe hypothesized that due to the complex nature of the stimuli, unrelated factors would be balanced across a large number of events, and make the bias of spatial information accessible to a conventional model-based statistical analysis of BOLD fMRI data. This model-driven approach required a detailed annotation of the occurrence of relevant stimulus features. The annotation of both stimuli revealed the respective number of incidentally occurring events to be similar to those of a conventional experimental paradigm used to localize functional regions of interest. \n\nWe modeled hemodynamic responses correlating with spatial information embedded in the naturalistic stimuli, capitalizing on conceptually similar, but perceptually different stimulation events. On a group-average level, results for the movie show significantly increased hemodynamic activity spatially overlapping with a conventionally localized PPA but also extending into earlier visual cortices. Likewise, results for the audio-description identify significant activation in the PPA but restricted to its anterior part. Bilateral clusters in 9 of 14 participants (of which sub-04 shows only a right-lateralized PPA in the block-design localizer results), and a unilateral significant cluster in one participant, indicate that the group average results are representative for the majority of individual participants. These findings suggest that increased activation in the PPA during the perception of static pictures generalizes to the perception of spatial information embedded in a movie or a purely auditory narrative. Current results may partially deviate from Sengupta   et al  . , due to the uniform cluster forming threshold employed in this study versus their adaptive procedure (bilateral clusters in 12 of 14 participants and a unilateral right cluster in two participants (sub-04, sub-20). \n\nThe fact that clusters of responses to the auditory stimulus are spatially restricted to the anterior part of clusters from both visual paradigms raises the question if the revealed correlation patterns can be attributed to different features inherent in the visual stimuli compared to a purely auditory stimulus. Due to the nature of the datasets investigated here, such an attribution can only be preliminary, because the auditory stimulation dataset also differs in key acquisition properties (field-strength, resolution) from the comparison datasets, representing a confound of undetermined impact. However, previous studies in the field of visual perception provide evidence that the PPA can be divided into functionally subregions that might process different stimulus features. The posterior PPA (pPPA) is functionally more responsive than the anterior PPA (aPPA) to low-level features of scenes or (abstract) objects . In contrast, the aPPA responds more to high-level features of scenes (e.g., real-word size ; a scene\u2019s abstract category or context ) and objects (e.g., spatial contextual associations ) than the pPPA. Moreover, pPPA and aPPA show differences in connectivity profiles. The pPPA exhibits more coactivation with the occipital visual cortex than the aPPA . Activity in the aPPA, on the other hand, is found to be correlated with components of the default mode network, including caudal inferior parietal lobe, retrosplenial complex, medial prefrontal cortex, and lateral surface of the anterior temporal lobe . Baldassano   et al  .  propose that the PPA creates a complete scene representation, based on different aspects of a visual scene processed in subregions of the PPA. Similarly, our results suggest that the pPPA might be more concerned with visual spatial features that are intrinsic to pictures or movie shots of landscapes. The aPPA, in contrast, might be more concerned with spatial information that cannot only be inferred from visual stimuli but also from auditory stimuli, such as speech. For example, scene properties extrapolated from a context description or label, such as \u201cfootball stadium\u201d, \u201cmilitary hospital\u201d, or objects and their spatial relationship, such as the descriptions \u201cbus stop\u201d and \u201croadside\u201d, or the sound of a car passing by. \n\nBased on the report by Aziz-Zadeh   et al  . , we hypothesized that semantic spatial information embedded in the audio-description would correlate with increased hemodynamic activity in the PPA. Methods and results presented here differ from this previous study in key aspects. Aziz-Zadeh   et al  .  modeled events from onset to offset of sentences, describing unknown and famous places and faces, and compared activity levels that were averaged across voxels of regions of interest (PPA and fusiform face area, FFA ) defined by a localizer experiment. Their results showed decreased activity in only the left PPA compared to activity in the FFA for sentences describing famous places in contrast to famous faces. Here, we modeled events from onset to offset of single words and performed a voxelwise whole-brain analysis. Group results of the audio-description\u2019s primary contrast yielded significantly increased hemodynamic activity spatially restricted to the anterior part of the PPA group overlap. Contrary to Aziz-Zadeh   et al  . , our results suggest that auditory spatial information compared to non-spatial information correlates with bilaterally increased activation in the anterior part of the PPA. \n\nIt is common for conventional localizer paradigms to employ a task to keep participants attentive to the stimuli. Nevertheless, one early block-design study  compared results from a paradigm that employed a perceptual judgment task of static pictures to the same paradigm but without that task. Hemodynamic activity was less but still significantly increased when participants had no task to keep them alert and attentive to the stimuli. The naturalistic stimulation paradigm employed here is similar in the sense that participants had no behavioral or cognitive task (e.g., forming a mental image of the stimuli ) but just had to \u201cenjoy the presentation\u201d. Nevertheless, the naturalistic paradigm differs from Epstein and Kanwisher , because the relevant stimulus features were embedded in a continuous stream of complex auditory (and visual) information which makes it unlikely that participants speculated on the purpose of the investigation, or performed undesired and unknown evaluation or categorization of isolated stimuli. Our results therefore indicate that verbally communicated spatial information is processed, in the anterior PPA, automatically and without specifically guided attention. \n\nOur approach to movie stimulus annotation and event selection differs from previous reports in the literature. In an earlier study, Bartels and Zeki  manually annotated the content of movie frames (color, faces, language, and human bodies) and found that the functional specialization of brain areas is preserved during movie watching. In contrast, we aimed to exploit a cinematographic confound in the structure of movies, where film directors tend to establish the spatial layout of locations in earlier shots and later focus more on detailed depictions of people and objects . The group results of the movie stimulus\u2019 primary contrast yielded a large cluster that spans the group overlap of individual PPAs from anterior to posterior. The cluster extends into more posterior, earlier visual areas could be an indication that the temporal averaging across events suffered from insufficient controlling for confounding visual features. Future studies that aim to use a movie to localize visual areas in individual participants should extensively annotate the content of frames (e.g., using the open-source solution \u201cPliers\u201d  for feature extraction from a visual naturalistic stimulus). \n\nIn the visual domain, pictures of landscapes and not pictures of landmarks or buildings are considered to be the \u201coptimal\u201d stimulus type . In the audio-description\u2019s primary contrast, we did not include the categories that contain switches from one setting to another (se_new and se_old) which one might assume to contain the auditory equivalent to pictures of landscapes. The reason was that the categories se_new and se_old were heterogeneous: they rarely contained holistic (but also vague) descriptions of landscapes (e.g., \u201c[Forrest is running through the] jungle\u201d) but mostly landmarks or buildings, and also non-spatial hints (e.g., \u201c[Jenny as a] teenager\u201c). Humans can identify the gist of a rich visual scene within the duration of a single fixation . Hence, further studies might investigate if vague verbal descriptions of landscapes lead to a different hemodynamic activity level than descriptions of more concrete parts of a scene (e.g.,\u00a0\u201c[a] beacon\u201d, \u201c[a] farmhouse\u201d). \n\nApart from the PPA, results show significantly increased activity in the ventral precuneus and posterior cingulate region (referred to as \u201cretrosplenial complex\u201d, RSC) of the medial parietal cortex, and in the superior lateral occipital cortex (referred to as \u201coccipital place area\u201d, OPA) for both naturalistic stimuli. Like the PPA, the RSC and OPA have repeatedly shown increased hemodynamic activity in studies investigating visual spatial perception and navigation . Thus, our model-driven approach to operationalize spatial perception based on stimulus annotations reveals increased hemodynamic responses in a network that is implicated in visual spatial perception and cognition. Similarly to the parahippocampal cortex , the medial parietal cortex exhibits a posterior-anterior gradient from being more involved in perceptual processes to being more involved in memory related processes . Future, complementary studies using specifically designed paradigms could investigate where in the posterior-anterior axis of the parahippocampal and medial parietal cortex auditory semantic information is correlated with increased hemodynamic activity: we hypothesize that the auditory perception of spatial information (compared to non-spatial information) is correlating with clusters in the middle of possibly overlapping clusters correlating with visual perception (peak activity more posterior) and scene construction from memory (peak activity more anterior). \n\nIn summary, natural stimuli like movies  or narratives  can be used as a continuous, complex, immersive, task-free paradigm that more closely resembles our natural dynamic environment than traditional experimental paradigms. We took advantage of three fMRI acquisitions and two stimulus annotations that are part of the open-data resource   to operationalize the perception of spatial information embedded in an audio-visual movie and an auditory narrative, and compare current results to a previous report of a conventional, block-design localizer. The current study offers evidence that a model-driven GLM analysis based on annotations can be applied to a naturalistic paradigm to localize concise functional areas and networks correlating with specific perceptual processes \u2013 an analysis approach that can be facilitated by the neuroscout.org platform . More specifically, our results demonstrate that increased activation in the PPA during the perception of static pictures generalizes to the perception of spatial information embedded in a movie and an exclusively auditory stimulus. Our results provide further evidence that the PPA can be divided into functional subregions that coactivate during the perception of visual scenes. Finally, the presented evidence on the in-principle suitability of a naturally engaging, purely auditory paradigm for localizing the PPA may offer a path to the development of diagnostic procedures more suitable for individuals with visual impairments or conditions like nystagmus. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe used components of the publicly available   dataset that has been repeatedly used by other research groups in independent studies (e.g., ). The same participants were a) listening to the audio-description  of the movie \u201cForrest Gump\u201d, b) watching the audio-visual movie , and c) participating in a dedicated six-category block-design visual localizer . An exhaustive description of the participants, stimulus creation, procedure, stimulation setup, and fMRI acquisition can be found in the corresponding publications. Following is a summary of the most important aspects. \n\n### Participants \n  \nIn the audio-description study , 20 German native speakers (all right-handed, age 21\u201338 years, mean age 26.6 years, 12 male) listened to the German audio-description  of the movie \u201cForrest Gump\u201d . In the movie study , 15 participants (21\u201339 years, mean age 29.4, six female), a subgroup of the prior audio-description study, watched the audio-visual movie with dubbed German audio track . In the block-design localizer study , the same 15 participants took part in a six-category block-design visual localizer. All participants reported to have normal hearing, normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and no known history of neurological disorders. In all studies, participants received monetary compensation and gave written informed consent for their participation and for public sharing of obtained data in anonymized form. The studies had prior approval by the Ethics Committee of Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg, Germany. \n\n\n### Stimuli and procedure \n  \nThe German DVD release  of the movie \u201cForrest Gump\u201d  and its temporally aligned audio-description  served as naturalistic stimuli, with an approximate duration of two hours, split into eight consecutive segments of \u224815\u2009minutes. The audio-description adds another male narrator to the voice-over narration of the main character Forrest Gump. This additional narration describes essential aspects of the visual scenery when there is no off-screen voice, dialog, or other relevant auditory content. For all sessions with naturalistic stimuli, participants were instructed to inhibit physical movements except for eye-movements, and otherwise to simply \u201cenjoy the presentation\u201d. For details on stimulus creation and presentation see Hanke   et al  . . \n\nStimuli for the block-design localizer study were 24 unique grayscale images of faces, bodies, objects, houses, outdoor scenes and scrambled images, matched in luminance and size, that were previously used in other studies (e.g., ). Participants performed a one-back image matching task for four block-design runs, with two 16\u2009s blocks per stimulus category in each run. For details on stimulus creation and presentation see Sengupta   et al  . . \n\n\n### Stimulation setup \n  \nIn the audio-description study, visual instructions were presented on a rear-projection screen inside the scanner bore. During the functional scans, the projector presented a medium gray screen with the primary purpose to illuminate a participant\u2019s visual field in order to prevent premature fatigue. In the movie and block-design localizer study, visual instructions and stimuli were presented on a rear-projection screen at a viewing distance of 63\u2009cm, with a movie frame projection size of approximately 21.3\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20099.3\u00b0. In the block-design localizer study, stimulus images were displayed at a size of approximately 10\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00b0 of visual angle. Auditory stimulation was implemented using custom in-ear (audio-description), or over-the-ear headphones (movie), which reduced the scanner noise by at least 20\u201330\u2009dB. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nGradient-echo fMRI data for the audio-description study were acquired using a 7 Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM magnetic resonance scanner equipped with a 32 channel brain receive coil at 2\u2009s repetition time (TR) with 36 axial slices (thickness 1.4\u2009mm, 1.4\u2009\u00d7\u20091.4\u2009mm in-plane resolution, 224\u2009mm field-of-view, anterior-to-posterior phase encoding direction) and a 10% inter-slice gap, recorded in ascending order. Slices were oriented to include the ventral portions of frontal and occipital cortex while minimizing intersection with the eyeballs. The field of view was centered on the approximate location of Heschl\u2019s gyrus. EPI images were online-corrected for motion and geometric distortions. \n\nIn the movie and block-design localizer study, a 3 Tesla Philips Achieva dStream MRI scanner with a 32 channel head coil acquired gradient-echo fMRI data at 2\u2009s repetition time with 35 axial slices (thickness 3.0\u2009mm, 10% inter-slice gap) with 80\u2009\u00d7\u200980 voxels (3.0\u2009\u00d7\u20093.0\u2009mm of in-plane resolution, 240\u2009mm field-of-view) and an anterior-to-posterior phase encoding direction, recorded in ascending order. A total of 3599 volumes were recorded for each participant in each of the naturalistic stimulus paradigms (audio-description and movie). \n\n\n### Preprocessing \n  \nThe current analyses were carried out on the same preprocessed fMRI data (s.  ) that were used for the technical validation analysis presented in Hanke   et al  . . Of those 15 participants in the studyforrest dataset that took part in all three experiments, data of one participant were dropped due to invalid distortion correction during scanning of the audio-description stimulus. Data were corrected for motion, aligned with and re-sliced onto a participant-specific BOLD template image  (uniform spatial resolution of 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009mm for both audio-description and movie data). Preprocessing was performed by FEAT v6.00 (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool ) as shipped with FSL v5.0.9 ( ) on a computer-cluster running  . \n\nFor the present analysis, the following additional preprocessing was performed. High-pass temporal filtering was applied to every stimulus segment using a Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line with a cutoff period of 150\u2009s (sigma = 75.0\u2009s) to remove low-frequency confounds. The brain was extracted from surrounding tissues using BET . Data were spatially smoothed applying a Gaussian kernel with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 4.0\u2009mm. A grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire 4D dataset was performed by a single multiplicative factor. Correction for local autocorrelation in the time series (prewhitening) was applied using FILM (FMRIB\u2019s Improved Linear Model ) to improve estimation efficiency. \n\n\n### Event selection \n  \nIn contrast to stimuli designed to trigger a perceptual process of interest, while controlling for confounding variables (e.g., color and luminance), naturalistic stimuli have a fixed but initially unknown temporal structure of stimulus features of interest, as well as an equally unknown confound structure. In order to evaluate the suitability of the stimulus for the targeted analyses, and to inform the required hemodynamic models, we annotated the temporal structure of a range of stimulus features. \n\nFor the analysis of the movie stimulus, we took advantage of a previously published annotation of 869 movie cuts and the depicted location after each cut . Contrary to manually annotating stimulus features of movie frames (for example, as performed by Bartels and Zeki  for color, faces, language, and human bodies), we categorized movie cuts that - in general - realign the viewer within the movie environment by switching to another perspective within the same setting, or to a position in an entirely different setting. More specifically, we sought to exploit a cinematographic bias as at a setting\u2019s first occurrence in a movie, shots tend to broadly establish the setting and the spatial layout within the setting. On revisiting an already established setting, the shot sizes tend to decrease and more often depict people talking to each other or objects that are relevant to the evolved plot . \n\nBased on this cinematographic bias, we assigned each cut to one of five categories (see Table\u00a0 ): 1) a cut switching to a setting that was depicted for the first time (vse_new), 2) a cut switching to a setting that was already depicted earlier in the movie (vse_old), 3) a cut switching to another locale within a setting (vlo_ch; e.g., a cut from the first to the second floor in Forrest\u2019s house), 4) a cut to another camera position within a setting or locale that was depicted for the first time (vpe_new), and 5) a cut to another camera position within a setting or locale that was already depicted before (vpe_old). Note that this categorization is not necessarily evident from the visual content of the first movie frame after a cut. As a control condition with events of no particular processing of spatial information (no_cut) we pseudo-randomly selected movie frames from continuous movie shots that lasted longer than 20\u2009s, and had a minimum temporal distance of at least 10\u2009s to any movie cut and to any other no_cut event. \n\nFor the analysis of the audio-description stimulus, we extended a publicly available annotation of its speech content  by classifying concrete and countable nouns that the narrator uses to describe the movie\u2019s absent visual content. An initial annotation was performed by one individual, and minor corrections were applied after comparing with a second categorization done by the author. A complete overview of all 18 noun categories, their inclusion criteria, and examples can be seen in Table\u00a0 . Some categories reflect the verbal counterpart of the stimulus categories that were used in the visual localizer experiment (e.g., body, face, head, object, setting_new, and setting_rec). Other categories were created to semantically cluster remaining nouns into categories that had no counterpart in the visual localizer experiment (e.g., bodypart, female, fname, furniture, geo, groom, male, and persons). The categories setting_new and setting_rec comprise not just words that describe a setting as a whole (e.g., \u201c[in] Greenbow\u201d, \u201c[in a] disco\u201d, \u201c[the platoon wades through a] rice field\u201d). They also comprise words that could count as a member of another category in case the narrator uses these words to indicate a switch from one setting to another (e.g., \u201c[a] physician\u201d). These nouns were flagged with both categories during the initial annotation procedure. In context of the current analyses these word are considered to belong exclusively to the higher-level category of changing a setting (setting_new or setting_rec). Some noun categories that were semantically similar and offered only a small amount of counts were pooled resulting in 11 final event categories (see Table\u00a0 ). These event categories were then used to model hemodynamic responses.   \nCategories and criteria to categorize the nouns spoken by the audio-description\u2019s narrator. \n  \nExamples are given in English. Some of these initial 18 noun categories were pooled resulting in 11 event categories that served as basis to build the regressors of the GLM (see Table\u00a0 ). \n  \n\nLastly, we algorithmically annotated the temporal structure of low-level perceptual features to create nuisance regressors. For the movie stimulus, we computed the mean luminance (arbitrary units, average pixel brightness) of a movie frame (40\u2009ms), the difference in mean luminance of each frame\u2019s left and right half, the difference in mean luminance of the lower and upper half. As an indicator of visual change, we computed perceptual fingerprints for each movie frame using the pHash library  and recorded the cumulative bitwise difference to the previous frame. Finally for both audio tracks, we computed the left-right difference in volume and root mean square volume averaged across the length of every movie frame (40\u2009ms). \n\n\n### Hemodynamic modeling \n  \nThe events of the movie cut related categories and no_cut events were modeled as box car events of 200\u2009ms duration, speech events from onset to offset of each word, and frame-based confounds from onset to offset of the corresponding movie frame. For all regressors, the stimulus models were convolved with a double-gamma hemodynamic response function (HRF), as implemented in FSL. \n\nGiven the unknown confound structure of the naturalistic stimuli, we inspected the correlation of regressors of each stimulus and also across both stimuli (see Fig.\u00a0 ). The computed Pearson correlation coefficients show only minor correlations of feature regressors for the same stimulus. Maximum correlations are found for low-level auditory confounds across stimuli, which is to be expected, as the audio-description contains the audio track of the movie plus the additional narrator (see Fig.\u00a0 ; correlation between root mean square volume of both audio tracks, r = 0.76; correlation between left-right volume difference of both audio tracks, r = 0.77). The observed correlation pattern did not indicate problematic confounds of nuisance variables and regressors of interest for any of the planned analyses.   \nPearson correlation coefficients of model response time series used as regressors in the GLM analysis of the audio-description (blue; see Table\u00a0  for a description) and audio-visual movie (red; see Table\u00a0 ). Values are rounded to the nearest tenth. The correlation between the two stimuli\u2019s root mean square volume and between their left-right difference in volume yielded the highest correlation values (fg_ad_rms and fg_av_ger_rms, r = 0.7635; fg_ad_lrdiff and fg_av_ger_lrdiff, r = 0.7749). \n  \n\nThe design matrix for the first-level time-series GLM analysis of the movie comprised regressors for the 12 event categories of the movie listed in Table\u00a0 . Similarly, the design matrix for the analysis of the audio-description comprised regressors for the 13 event categories of the audio-description, also listed in Table\u00a0 . In order to implement cross-modal control contrasts, the design matrix for the movie stimulus also contained the regressors based on nouns used by the audio-description\u2019s narrator to indicate a switch to another setting (categories se_new and se_old). Likewise, the design matrix for the audio-description included the five movie cut related regressors (vse_new, vse_old, vlo_ch, vp_new, vpe_old). For both stimuli, a null regressor was used for any event category in a segment for which no event of a category was present (e.g., no event of vpe_old in segment 3; see Table\u00a0 ). Temporal derivatives of all regressors were added to the design matrix to compensate for regional differences . Lastly, six participant-specific and run-specific motion estimates (translation and rotation) were also included. The design matrices were temporally filtered with the same high-pass filter (cutoff period of 150\u2009s) as the BOLD time series. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nWe performed standard two-level GLM analyses to aggregate results across all BOLD acquisition runs for every participant and each stimulus separately. Subsequently, we conducted third-level analyses to average contrast estimates over participants for each stimulus, respectively. \n\nGiven the rich naturalistic stimuli and the availability of various stimulus feature annotations, there are several candidates for implementing contrasts to identify hemodynamic activity congruent with the hypothesized processing of spatial information in the PPA. However, while the rationale for any contrast composition must be sound, the selection of a single implementation remains arbitrary to some degree. Consequently, we computed multiple contrasts that are listed in Table\u00a0  for the movie and audio-description, respectively. For each stimulus, we picked a primary contrast for result presentation (marked with an asterisk in the table) based on a subjectively assessed balance of how well the averaged events within categories represent spatial and non-spatial information, and the number of events in the stimulus. An evaluation of the robustness of these results with respect to similar but different contrasts is provided in the\u00a0 .   \nComputed contrasts for the analysis of the movie and the audio description, and their respective purpose. \n  \nThe primary contrasts are marked with an asterisk. non-spatial refers to the event categories body, bodypart, fahead, object, sex_f, sex_m. An explanation of all event categories can be found in Table\u00a0 . \n  \n\nIn the primary contrast of the movie stimulus, we contrasted cuts to a setting that was not depicted before (vse_new) to cuts merely switching the camera position within a setting that was already established earlier in the movie (vpe_old). We chose the contrast vse_new\u2009>\u2009vpe_old as the primary contrast, because it is contrasting the most different categories in regard to the averaged movie frames\u2019 content: due to a cinematographic bias, the category vse_new tends to comprise mostly shots that were designed to orient the viewer in the movie\u2019s broader environment using wider shots sizes (ranging from \u201cestablishing shots\u201d to \u201cwide shots\u201d). In contrast, the category vpe_old comprises mostly shots depicting details of a scene using narrower shot sizes (ranging from \u201cmedium shots\u201d to \u201cclose ups\u201d). audio-description stimulus, we contrasted mentions of buildings and landmarks (geo), and rooms and geometry-defining objects (groom) with nouns referring to a person\u2019s head or face (fahead), and other non-geometry related categories (body, bodypart, fahead, object, sex_f, sex_m). The category \u201cfurniture\u201d (furn) was not used as a regressor of interest in any contrast because these nouns could be perceived as either a geometry-defining scene element or as an isolated object. The categories of nouns indicating a switch to a setting that occurred for the first time (se_new) or a setting that recurred during the plot (se_old) were not included in the primary contrast because they comprise a) nouns that could be a member of another category (e.g., \u201c[a] physician\u201d), and b) nouns that only vaguely identify a scene (e.g., \u201c[in] Greenbow\u201d, \u201c[in a] disco\u201d,\u00a0\u201d[black and white] film recordings\u201d) compared to perceptually richer descriptions. \n\nFinally, we created several control contrasts for both stimuli (see Table\u00a0 ). For the movie stimulus, four contrasts were created contrasting the no-cut regressor (vno_cut) to cut-related regressors. One contrast was created by contrasting nouns spoken by the (missing) narrator comparing nouns that indicate a switch to another setting (se_new > se_old), and that were moderately correlated with movie cuts indicating a switch to another setting (see Fig.\u00a0 ). For the audio-description stimulus, we created five control contrasts to test if activation in the PPA was correlated with moments of cuts, despite the absence of visual stimulation. \n\nFirst-level GLM analyses were performed in the image-space of a participant-specific BOLD T2* template using a previously determined linear transformation . For higher-level analyses image data were aligned with a study-specific T2* group template likewise using a previously computed non-linear transformation . This group template was co-registered to the MNI 152 template with an affine transformation (12 degrees of freedom). \n\nThe second-level analyses, which averaged contrast estimates over the eight stimulus segments, were carried out using a fixed-effects model by forcing the random effects variance to zero in FLAME (FMRIB\u2019s Local Analysis of Mixed Effects ). (Gaussianised T/F) statistic images were thresholded using clusters determined by   Z  >3.4 and a cluster-corrected significance threshold of   p   = 0.05 . \n\nThe third level analysis which averaged contrast estimates over participants was carried out using FLAME stage 1 with automatic outlier detection . Here again, Z (Gaussianised T/F) statistic images were thresholded using clusters determined by   Z   > 3.4 and a corrected cluster significance threshold of   p   = 0.05 . Brain regions associated with observed clusters were determined with the J\u00fclich Histological Atlas  and the Harvard-Oxford Cortical Atlas  provided by FSL. Regions of interest masks for individual PPAs and a PPA group mask of individual PPA overlaps were created from data provided by Sengupta   et al  . . \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8975992, "text_md5": "3a9de0269d0409570f6478b184c3414b", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 63], "journal": [64, 72], "publication_year": [74, 78], "title": [89, 193], "keywords": [207, 227], "abstract": [240, 1458], "body": [1467, 50223]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 35365659, "doi": "10.1038/s41597-022-01250-4", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8975992", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8975992"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8975992\">8975992</a>", "list_title": "PMC8975992  Processing of visual and non-visual naturalistic spatial information in the \"parahippocampal place area\""}

This study examined age effects on consolidation-related neural mechanisms and their susceptibility to interference using functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 13 younger (20\u201330 years, 8 female) and 16 older (49\u201375 years, 5 female) healthy participants. fMRI was performed before and during a memory paradigm comprised of encoding, consolidation, and retrieval phases. Consolidation was variously challenged: (1) control (no manipulation), (2) interference (repeated stimulus presentation with interfering information), and (3) reminder condition (repeated presentation without interfering information). We analyzed the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) to compare brain activity changes from pre- to post-encoding rest. In the control condition, fALFF was decreased in the left supramarginal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, and left precuneus but increased in parts of the occipital and inferior temporal cortex. Connectivity analyses between fALFF-derived seeds and network ROIs revealed an aging-related decrease in the efficiency of functional connectivity (FC) within the ventral stream network and between salience, default mode, and central executive networks during consolidation. Moreover, our results indicate increased interference susceptibility in older individuals with dynamics between salience and default mode networks as a neurophysiological correlate. Conclusively, aging-related memory decline is partly caused by inefficient consolidation. Memory consolidation requires a complex interplay between large-scale brain networks, which qualitatively decreases with age. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAging is associated with progressive cognitive decline and impairment in the activities of daily living ( ;  ). These deficits have a significant impact on the quality of life of the aging population and lead to a tremendous burden on societies and health care systems ( ;  ;  ;  ). Age-related cognitive decline is predominant in memory compared to other cognitive abilities ( ;  ). However, several studies have shown that memory is not uniformly affected by age. Episodic memory is particularly vulnerable to the effects of aging ( ). It is essential to learn and store new information to perform the activities of daily living. Understanding which mechanisms lead to episodic memory decline can help us develop compensatory strategies and thus promote independence in old age. \n\nThere has been considerable research on aging-related decline in episodic memory and its neural substrates, mainly focusing on encoding- or retrieval-related processes. A meta-analysis by   confirmed increased activity during encoding in the right middle frontal gyrus, medial temporal lobes, and right putamen and decreased activity in the right precentral sulcus for younger compared to older individuals. For memory retrieval, an increased activity in the posterior occipital fissure and a decreased activity in the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, the supplementary motor area, and the middle temporal gyrus were confirmed for younger compared to older individuals. Since many of the areas with age differences were part of the so-called \u2018task-positive network\u2019 (TPN), the authors assume an age-dependent recruitment of the TPN during memory encoding and retrieval. Thus, aging-related memory decline seems to be not only explained by activity changes in individual brain regions, but, by changes in large-scale brain networks. Further studies support this assumption. A study examining functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN) found reduced FC between the anterior and posterior components of the DMN with increasing age using correlation analyses over the time courses within   a priori   defined regions ( ). Also, the structural integrity within DMN and salience network (SN) is impaired in terms of reduced cortical thickness with increasing age. Superagers with preserved memory exhibit significantly less atrophy in regions of the DMN and SN compared to older individuals with memory deficits ( ). \n\nHowever, recent studies suggest that deficits in episodic memory are not only due to deficient neural processes during encoding and retrieval but at least partly due to impaired memory consolidation ( ).   Memory consolidation   is defined as the \u201cprogressive post-acquisition stabilization of memory\u201d that begins immediately after new information is encoded and continues for many hours or days. According to the standard model of memory consolidation, a memory trace becomes more and more stable over time, transferring the encoded information into long-term memory ( ). During consolidation, however, the memory trace is still vulnerable to retroactive interference, i.e., during this phase, new sensory input can overwrite what has been learned. Retroactive interference explains, for example, the phenomenon of memorizing your new phone number and not being able to recall your old number after some time. Thereby, the effect of retroactive interference is greater the more similar the learned material and the interfering material are. The robust finding that retrieval performance decreases upon interference with consolidation processes supports the assumption that memory deficits are in part due to impaired memory consolidation and not exclusively due to encoding or retrieval deficits ( ,  ). \n\nNevertheless, it remains controversial whether aging-associated memory decline can be explained by aging-related deficits in consolidation processes.   propose two possible mechanisms how memory consolidation might be affected by aging: (1) Memory consolidation processes become less efficient with increasing age due to qualitatively or quantitatively reduced neural activity, and (2) become more susceptible to interference with increasing age. \n\nInvestigating the first hypothesis is challenging as consolidation, unlike encoding and retrieval, is unrelated to a conscious experience or specific cognitive function. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the processes involved in consolidation. To date, there is no experimental paradigm that directly measures consolidation, neither behaviorally nor neurophysiologically. \n\nTwo forms of consolidation are distinguished, fast synaptic consolidation and slow systems consolidation. The latter leads to changes in the systems or brain circuits involved in encoding. In this process, the memory trace is reorganized, shifting the burden of storage from the hippocampus, which was particularly involved in encoding the information, to the neocortex. Thus, the neocortex can independently retain and retrieve the memory trace ( ). \n\nTraditionally, sleep is thought to be necessary for this process ( ;  ). During sleep, individuals remain undisturbed by any external sensory input, which creates an optimal setting for the reactivation of neural activity beneficial for the gradual transmission of the memory trace from the hippocampus to the neocortex. The assumption that sleep plays an important role in memory consolidation is supported by studies examining the effects of sleep disorders on memory performance. For example, a meta-analysis on studies with older adults showed that self-reported poor sleep correlated with impairments in several cognitive domains, including memory ( ). Objective measures of sleep also show that disturbed sleep is related to impairments in memory consolidation and thereby memory performance.   showed that age-related changes in slow-wave activity during sleep above the prefrontal cortex are associated with increased hippocampal activation during a retrieval task the next day. Thus, the memory trace has not become independent of the hippocampus, indicating deficient consolidation. This finding implies that the effect of deficient consolidation on age-related memory decline is mediated by increasingly poor sleep in old age ( ). \n\nHowever, sleep seems to be beneficial but not crucial for memory consolidation. There is growing evidence that system consolidation already occurs immediately after encoding ( ). Thus, to examine the effect of age on memory consolidation without the influence of age-related sleep disturbances, we focus on consolidation during the awake resting state in the present study. Moreover, in an experimental setting, it can be ensured that individuals remain undisturbed by any external sensory input similar to sleep. Therefore, the analysis of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during wakeful rest after encoding is a promising technique to investigate the neural mechanisms involved in system consolidation and the effect of aging thereon. \n\nRecent resting-state (rs) fMRI studies have shown that activation patterns initially evident during encoding spontaneously reoccur during post-encoding rest and sleep ( ). Moreover, FC of local brain areas active during encoding and those active during retrieval increases from pre- to post-encoding rest ( ), likewise hippocampal-vmPFC crosstalk increases during consolidation ( ). In line with the standard model of memory consolidation and the multitrace theory ( ), these studies indicate that during consolidation the memory trace is stabilized through the replay of neural activity and is distributed across different brain regions. Accordingly, it is reasonable to assume that different memory-associated brain regions cooperate in networks during memory consolidation. A network or whole-brain rather than a ROI-based approach is required to verify this idea. To examine the effect of age on the neural mechanisms during consolidation   used such a network-based approach and found that subsequent memory performance was predicted by increased FC in a temporo-occipital network and decreased FC in the default mode network during the resting phase after encoding. Older compared to younger individuals failed to show increased connectivity in the right lingual gyrus as part of an extended default mode network during the consolidation phase. Additionally,   analyzed within-network FC and the orchestration of different memory-associated large-scale brain networks during post-encoding rest. They found higher competition between the default mode and the executive network during post-encoding rest, which was associated with better retrieval performance in older compared to younger individuals. \n\nAge differences in the neural mechanisms underlying consolidation were only addressed in the latter two studies reported. However, these studies cannot answer the question of an age-dependent effect of interference on neural consolidation processes because either no interference condition was implemented ( ) or they were not designed to measure the effect of interference at the stimulus level ( ). The present study fills this gap by implementing an interference condition that induces stimulus-specific interference of the information being consolidated. \n\nNevertheless, there are already a number of behavioral studies on the effect of interference on subsequent memory performance, with contradictory results (e.g.,  ;  ). However, as age-related decline in executive functions such as inhibition capacity has been frequently reported in the literature ( ;  ;  ;  ), we expect that older individuals have a reduced ability to suppress new spatial information from the interference task, resulting in overwriting of the spatial position learned during encoding. Accordingly, we expect that the consolidation of the spatial information learned during encoding will be impaired, leading to deficient memory performance. In the present study, we introduce a more sophisticated measure of interference susceptibility than retrieval performance after interference, which has been used in most studies on this topic ( ,  ;  ;  ). In the present study, interference-related errors are differentiated from general errors and related to successful retrieval of the material to be remembered. We propose this measure as a more sensitive indicator of interference susceptibility during consolidation. \n\nFinally, besides interference with consolidation processes, we are interested in whether experimentally induced memory reactivation through exposure to cues for recently learned information can strengthen consolidation processes in older adults. A central mechanism of consolidation seems to be the repeated reactivation of activity patterns from encoding. Previous studies in rodents ( ) and humans have already shown that the number of spontaneous reactivations during consolidation can predict memory performance ( ). Furthermore, the presentation of cues for previously learned information during sleep, during a working-memory task ( ) and during wakeful rest ( ) can induce a reactivation of activity patterns from encoding, resulting in improved subsequent memory performance. Another study in which the learned information was presented again for a very brief period during a cover task also showed a beneficial effect on subsequent memory performance. This effect was stronger the worse the performance in a previous immediate recall task was ( ). Accordingly, we expect that especially older individuals will benefit from targeted memory reactivation and that this could represent a potential compensatory strategy for age-related memory decline. \n\nTaken together, the present study investigates whether aging-related memory decline can be explained by mechanisms of memory consolidation. We hypothesize that memory consolidation processes become less efficient with increasing age due to qualitatively or quantitatively reduced neural activity and functional connectivity (H1). Besides, we hypothesize that susceptibility to interference increases with age, as indicated by changes in neural activity and functional connectivity during consolidation (H2). Finally, we assume that experimentally induced repeated reactivation of information to be remembered supports consolidation processes and thus may serve as a compensatory strategy for aging-related memory decline due to impaired consolidation processes (H3). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Sample \n  \nA total of 36 cognitively healthy participants attended the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of  . Participants were recruited as part of the AMATE study (Aging and MCI and Alteration of Top-Down Control during Episodic Memory Encoding) through advertisements. Participants had no contraindication for MRI measurements, no psychiatric or neurological disorders, and were not on medication acting on the central nervous system. All participants were native German speakers, had normal or corrected to normal vision, and were right-handed, as assessed by the Edinburgh handedness inventory ( ). According to our inclusion criteria, we recruited individuals between 18 and 30 years of age for healthy young individuals and between 50 and 89 years of age for healthy senior individuals. Groups differed significantly in years of age and education. According to Fisher\u2019s Exact Test, gender was equally distributed in both groups ( ). \n  \nGroup comparison of demographic variables. \n    \nParticipants had to be excluded from further analyses due to (1) substantial signal dropout due to technical difficulties (  N   = 1), (2) memory performance below the probability of guessing (  N   = 1) (3) substantial deviation from the study protocol (e.g., no filler task during the consolidation session;   N   = 1), (4) extensive head-motion exceeding 3mm head translations in any direction ( ) (  N   = 2), and (5) subject-specific mean motion (FD Jenkinson; Framewise Displacement as per  ) exceeding the group mean by more than three times the interquartile range (outlier detection;   N   = 2). Thus, 29 participants entered further analyses with 13 healthy young (HY) and 16 healthy senior (HS) participants. \n\nA comprehensive neuropsychological test battery was applied before the fMRI experiment covering memory, attention, visuospatial abilities, language, and executive functions. Neuropsychological testing was performed as part of the AMATE study, as   described. Based on the neuropsychological test results and questionnaires, all participants were classified as cognitively normal and without depressive and psychiatric symptoms by an experienced neuropsychologist. As expected, groups differed significantly in neuropsychological tests concerning episodic memory and executive functions ( ). \n  \nGroup comparison of neuropsychological test results. \n    \n\n### Experimental Design \n  \nThe present study represents a mixed design. Both, the participants in the HS group and the participants in the HY group completed three fMRI experiments approximately 1 week apart (  Mode   = 7 days). Participants performed a spatial contextual memory task in each experiment, consisting of an encoding, a subsequent consolidation, and a retrieval phase. The consolidation phase was interrupted by a second divergent task to induce a modulatory effect on memory consolidation. The three fMRI experiments varied in the extent to which consolidation processes were modulated. The fMRI experiment with the control task (no interference with previously encoded information) is further referred to as the   control condition (CON).   The fMRI experiment with the reminder task (repeated presentation of the stimulus   without   the interference of spatial context information) is called the   reminder condition (RE)  , and the fMRI experiment with the interference task (repeated presentation of the stimulus   with   interference of spatial context information) is further referred to as the   interference condition   (  INT  , for more details, see section Stimuli and Task). The order of the three conditions was randomized to account for sequence effects ( ). Randomization of the order of conditions was statistically tested and confirmed after exclusion of outliers using Fisher\u2019s exact test (  p   = 0.989). \n\nAdditionally, three resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) measurements were obtained in each experiment: a baseline rsfMRI at the beginning of the experiment (pre-encoding rest; R1), a rsfMRI after the initial encoding task (immediate post-encoding rest; R2), and a rsfMRI after the modulatory task (delayed post-encoding rest; R3;  ). Participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed and relax without falling asleep during the acquisition. \n  \nExperimental setup. Three fMRI sessions, differing in the type of interference, took place 1 week apart and in randomized order. In each session, a contextual memory task was implemented, consisting of an encoding, a consolidation, and a retrieval phase. Resting periods occurred before encoding (R1), after encoding (R2), and before retrieval (R3). CON, control condition; RE, reminder condition; INT, interference condition. \n  \n\n### Stimuli and Task \n  \nThe spatial contextual memory task used in the present study is an adaptation of a well-established paradigm ( ;  ,  ), consisting of an encoding, a modulating, and a retrieval task. The encoding task consisted of 64 trials. During each trial, participants saw a stimulus, showing a colored photograph of a natural or artificial (man-made) object. The stimuli were randomly presented in one of four circles on a white screen, arranged in a horizontal semi-circle bent to the top. Participants had to memorize the object and its respective position. To ensure alertness, participants had to indicate whether the object was natural or artificial by pressing two corresponding keys with their right index and middle finger, respectively. Each stimulus was presented for 3 s with a variable inter-trial interval of 2 to 12 s, followed by a fixation cross presented for 2 s. \n\nThe consolidation phase was interrupted by a modulatory task that differed between conditions in the extent to which consolidation processes were supposed to be affected: \n\nInterference task: In the interference condition, the same stimuli as in the encoding task were presented again, but at a different position. Thus, the spatial contextual information was expected to interfere with that of the initial encoding task. Participants were asked to decide whether the object was natural or artificial but to ignore the spatial position. \n\nReminder task: In the reminder condition, the stimuli presented during encoding were presented again, albeit in the middle at the bottom of the screen. Thus, no interference with spatial contextual information was assumed. Instead, repeated presentation of the stimuli at a neutral position was expected to facilitate memory consolidation by causing reactivation of the memory for the respective position during the preceding encoding run. Participants were asked to make natural-artificial judgments. They were not instructed to recall the position of the stimuli from the encoding task. \n\nControl task: In the control task, abstract and pixelated images with no meaningful information were presented in the middle at the bottom of the screen. Participants were asked to press a button with their right index finger each time an image appeared. The task was expected to provide neither interference nor any type of reminder, while variables such as motor activity and visual input were kept constant to the interference and reminder task. \n\nFor each of these modulatory tasks, the number of stimuli, duration of presentation, and inter-trial interval were identical to the encoding task. \n\nDuring the retrieval task, the stimuli of the encoding task were presented in the screen\u2019s center. Participants had to indicate the position of the stimuli during encoding by pressing four respective keys with their right-hand fingers. Each stimulus was presented for 2 s, followed by a variable inter-trial interval of 2 to 12 s and a 2-s fixation cross. \n\n\n### Post-scan Questionnaires \n  \nAt the end of each of the three experiments, participants were asked whether they had fallen asleep. All participants reported staying awake during the three resting-state scans of each experiment, except one participant who reported falling asleep during the R3 session of the reminder condition. Additionally, participants were asked whether or not they intentionally rehearsed the learned material during the resting-state sessions. All participants negated active rehearsal of the information. \n\n\n### Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Acquisition \n  \nFunctional MR images were acquired using a Siemens TRIO 3-Tesla whole-body scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 12-channel phase array head coil for enhanced overall signal and transmission properties. T2*-weighted echo-planar images (EPI) with BOLD contrast were obtained using the following sequence parameters: time of repetition (TR) = 2.43 s, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, number of slices = 40 axial slices, slice thickness = 3 mm, slice order = interleaved ascending, flip angle = 90\u00b0, field of view = 200 mm, matrix size = 64 \u00d7 64, in-plane resolution/pixel size = 3.1 mm \u00d7 3.1 mm. The rsfMRI scans lasted 7 min, acquiring 180 volumes. Additionally, a T1-weighted, anatomical image was obtained for each participant using a three-dimensional magnetization-prepared, rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence (1 mm \u00d7 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm). \n\n\n### Image Processing \n  \nTo assess the physiological integrity of the brain and to check for structural changes indicating neurodegenerative diseases, the medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) score ( ) and the Koedam score for atrophy of the parietal lobe ( ) were evaluated on T1-weighted anatomical images for each participant. Additionally, the Fazekas scale for white matter hyperintensities was assessed on T2-FLAIR images. No positive scores on the MTA scale were found. Two HS had a positive Koedam score, indicating a substantial widening of the sulci and a volume reduction of the gyri in the parietal lobe. In addition, two HS had a Fazekas score of two, indicating moderate aging-related changes in white matter and thus a higher risk of developing cognitive impairment ( ). However, since no cognitive impairment was evident in these participants, they remained in the sample. \n\nPreprocessing of structural data was performed using the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12, Version 12.1 ), an extension of Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12 ). CAT12 was used with default settings, described in detail in the CAT12 manual . Preprocessing steps included: (1) bias field inhomogeneity correction, (2) skull stripping, (3) segmentation, (4) spatial normalization to the MNI space using the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL) algorithm ( ), and (5) resampling at an isotropic resolution of 1.5 mm. \n\nPreprocessing of functional data was performed using CONN functional connectivity toolbox 18.a ( ). In short, preprocessing steps included: (1) slice time correction, (2) motion correction (realigning and unwarping), (3) outlier detection (scans with an absolute displacement relative to the previous volume greater than 0.9 mm were defined as an outlier), (4) co-registration to the structural data, (5) normalization by applying the deformation field maps of the structural data, and (6) spatial smoothing using an 8 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. \n\nSubsequently, to improve sensitivity and reliability of the rsfMRI analyses, linear regression was used to remove the effects of nuisance variables, including realignment with six rigid-body parameters describing the motion of each participant (translation in the x-, y-, z-axis and rotation about the x-, y-, z-axis) and their first-order derivatives, and scrubbing with the images detected as outliers (see Outlier Detection). For the white matter signal and cerebrospinal fluid signal, a component-based noise correction method (CompCor) was applied to the data ( ). Finally, bandpass filtering to 0.008\u20130.09 Hz and detrending were performed. \n\nA comparison of the estimated distribution of correlation coefficients between randomly selected pairs of points in the brain before and after noise reduction confirmed that preprocessing and denoising successfully minimized the influence of artifactual factors on FC measurements ( ). \n\nMean motion as framewise displacement (Framewise Displacement as per  ) ranged from 0.11 to 0.13 mm (  SD   = 0.07\u20130.10) in each of the sessions. A 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 ANOVA with condition, session, and group as factors indicated a significant main effect session [  F(2,54)   = 10.77,   p   < 0.001].   Post-hoc   analyses revealed significantly higher FD for session 2 and 3 compared to session 1 in all conditions (both   p   < 0.01). In addition, older individuals showed higher FD compared to younger individuals across all sessions and conditions [  F(1,27)   = 14.15,   p   < 0.001]. A summary of the individual means and standard deviations can be found in  . \n\n\n### Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Analysis \n  \nOn the one hand, we aimed to investigate resting-state (RS) activity changes as a function of early memory consolidation processes without   a priori   assumptions. On the other hand, we were interested in how these areas of changing activity interact in networks during consolidation. Therefore, a two-step analysis was performed: First, the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) was calculated to analyze consolidation-related neural activity. Second, a region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analysis was performed using the fALFF clusters from the previous analysis as seed ROIs. \n\nThe rsfMRI analyses were performed in CONN Connectivity Toolbox. Significant results are reported at an FDR-corrected cluster-level threshold of   p   < 0.05 (cluster forming threshold   p   < 0.001, one-tailed). Analyses across both groups were corrected for age. Education was not included as an additional covariate based on the high correlation between age and education ( ). No correlation between gender and memory performance was found neither across groups nor within groups (both groups:   r   = 0.294,   p   = 0.121,   95% CI   [\u22120.121, 0.664]; HS:   r   = \u22122.72,   p   = 0.309,   95% CI   [\u22120.717, 0.284]; HY:   r   = 0.439,   p   = 133,   95% CI   [\u22120.173, 0.860]). Also, no gender effect was found with respect to resting-state activity, neither during post-encoding rest nor when compared to pre-encoding rest. For this reason, gender is also not included as a covariate of no interest. All analyses were corrected for the session-specific mean motion as assessed by mean FD Jenkinson ( ). As the behavioral results indicated that the modulating task during the consolidation phase of the reminder condition did not induce the expected effect on memory performance, rsfMRI analyses were performed only for the data of the control and interference condition, but not for the data of the reminder condition. \n\n#### Fractional Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations Analysis \n  \nUnlike other voxel-wise measures, fALFF does not reflect FC but rather the amplitude of neural activity during the resting state. FC analysis can provide us with information about a set of brain regions within a network, but it does not provide information about the change in regional activity. Furthermore, abnormal connectivity between brain regions does not allow us to determine exactly in which brain region the spontaneous activity is abnormal. Therefore, the analysis of low-frequency fluctuations using fALFF allows us to predict changes in intrinsic spontaneous brain activity in specific brain regions in older compared to younger individuals during memory consolidation. \n\nIn order to observe spontaneous and intrinsic brain activity during early memory consolidation, we calculated fALFF for pre-encoding rest (R1), and immediate (R2), and delayed post-encoding rest (R3). fALFF was calculated as the ratio of the root mean square of the BOLD signal within the frequency band of interest (0.008\u20130.09 Hz) relative to the entire frequency spectrum. Compared to the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fALFF is considered to offer higher sensitivity and specificity for spontaneous brain activity and is less prone to physiological noise ( ). To account for interindividual differences, the subject-level voxel-wise fALFF maps were transformed into z-score maps by subtracting the mean fALFF obtained for the entire brain and then dividing it by its standard deviation. \n\nA comparison between fALFF in CON R1 and CON R2 as well as CON R1 and CON R3 using paired   t  -tests informs about consolidation-related activity. The additional comparison between CON R2 and CON R3 indicates how this consolidation-related activity changes with time. To examine the influence of the interference task on consolidation-related activity, fALFF was compared between INT R1 and INT R3 as well as INT R2 and INT R3 using paired   t  -tests. To analyze the effect of age on consolidation-related resting-state activity changes, we performed interaction analyses with the factors   group   and   session   for both control and interference conditions. \n\nTo ensure that the contrasts described above did not result in changes in activity in brain regions where no significant activity was originally observed in R1, R2, or R3, the contrasts were masked. The masks used were binarized activity maps of the resting-state sessions, which were included in the respective contrast. For example, the contrast between CON R1 and CON R2 was calculated in a mask, which was a binarized activity map of the resting state activity during CON R1 and CON R2. The activity map resulted from a one-sample   t  -test across sessions CON R1 and CON R2. Clusters that exceeded the cluster-level threshold (p-FDR < 0.05) formed the respective resting activity map ( ). However, to check for possible bias due to this approach, we also performed the across-group contrasts at the whole-brain level. The results were consistent, except for the findings in the cerebellum ( ). \n  \nResting-state activity map.

R, right; L, left; A, anterior; P, posterior. \n  \nSubsequently, the mean fALFF values from the clusters that differed significantly in resting-state activity between R1 and R2/R3 of the control condition were exported, corrected for motion, and further analyzed in SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics; version 25, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States). Using multiple regression analysis, we examined correlations with memory performance measures. \n\n\n#### Region of Interest-to-Region of Interest Analysis \n  \nIn addition to consolidation-related resting-state activity changes from pre- to post-encoding rest, we were interested in the functional dynamics between the identified consolidation-related brain regions and large-scale brain networks during the consolidation phase. Therefore, we conducted a subsequent ROI-to-ROI analysis. The results of the fALFF analysis regarding the contrasts between the sessions of the control condition indicate that the consolidation process progresses from immediate to delayed post-encoding rest. The most inclusive activity changes could be observed between pre-encoding rest and delayed post-encoding rest. Therefore, the significant clusters of this contrast were used as seeds in the following ROI-to-ROI analysis. A memory network (literature-based selection of regions) and the predefined network ROIs of the CONN toolbox, which were derived from ICA analyses of the HCP dataset (497 participants) related to cognitive functions, were used as targets: \n  \n MTL memory network   ( ) \u2014 bilateral hippocampus and bilateral anterior and posterior parahippocampal cortex and bilateral anterior and posterior middle temporal gyrus. \n  \n Default mode network (DMN; CONN)   \u2014 medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral lateral parietal cortex, precuneus. \n  \n Salience network (SN; CONN)   \u2014 anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral anterior insula, bilateral rostral prefrontal cortex, bilateral supramarginal gyrus. \n  \n Visual network (VN; CONN)   \u2014 calcarine sulcus, occipital pole, bilateral lateral occipital gyrus. \n  \n Dorsal Attention network (DAN; CONN)   \u2014 bilateral frontal eye field, bilateral inferior parietal cortex. \n  \n Central Executive network (CEN; CONN)   \u2014 bilateral lateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral posterior parietal cortex. \n  \nRegion of interest-to-ROI FC matrices (with Fisher-transformed Pearson correlation coefficients between ROI-BOLD time series averaged over all ROI voxels) were calculated for each participant. First, we examined the integration of brain regions showing consolidation-related changes in resting-state activity into large-scale brain networks during early memory consolidation. To determine which functional connections between the fALFF-based seeds and network ROIs are significant during consolidation, we computed a one-sample   t  -test for the ROI-to-ROI correlation coefficients of the R3 session of the control condition, including both groups. Second, we examined the effect of interference on FC by calculating a paired   t  -test between FC in the R3 sessions of the control and interference conditions. Next, we analyzed the effect of age on FC. Therefore, we calculated a two-sample   t  -test to compare FC in the R3 session of the control condition. \n\nTo determine whether the observed connectivity pattern predicted memory performance, we computed a regression analysis for FC in the R3 session and memory performance in the control condition. In addition, we used multiple regression analysis to examine whether FC during the R3 session of the interference condition was related to memory performance and inhibition capacity in the interference condition. Only those ROI-to-ROI associations that showed FC during the R3 session of their respective condition were included in the multiple regression analyses. To examine group differences in the predictive value of FC for performance measures, the regression analyses were also calculated within groups. Subsequently, the correlation coefficients of the two groups were statistically compared using Fisher z-transformation. \n\n\n\n### Behavioral Data Analysis \n  \nAll behavioral data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 25, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States). Spatial contextual memory performance was operationalized by the percentage of correctly retrieved object-location associations. To evaluate the effects of age and interference, a mixed-effects ANOVA with the between-subjects factor   group   (  HY vs. HS  ) and the within-subject factor   condition   (  control  ,   reminder  , and   interference condition  ) was calculated. \n\nWe further analyzed the type of incorrect spatial contextual judgments in the interference condition. Two types of errors were classified: (1) intrusions, defined as trials in which the object-location association of the interference and not the object-location association of the encoding task was remembered, and (2) general errors, defined as trials in which judgments did not match the object position during either the interference or encoding task. First, a one-sample   t  -test was performed to evaluate whether the number of intrusions relative to the total number of incorrect responses was significantly different from chance and thus whether the experimental condition induced interference. Second, the total number of intrusions was examined for group differences using a two-sample   t  -test. Inhibition capacity or interference susceptibility was operationalized as d-prime: \n\nPositive d-prime values indicate the ability to successfully ignore the object-location associations from the interference task (inhibition capacity). A negative d-prime, in turn, indicates susceptibility to the object-location associations from the interference task (susceptibility to retroactive interference). A two-sample   t  -test analyzed group differences in d-prime. \n\nAnalyses including both groups were corrected for age. Education was not included as an additional covariate based on the high correlation between age and education. For an overview of the correlations of   age   and   education   with   behavioral performance   in all three experimental conditions, see  . Since no correlation was found between gender and memory performance either across or within groups (both groups:   r   = 0.294,   p   = 0.121,   95% CI   [\u22120.121, 0.664]; HS:   r   = \u22122.72,   p   = 0.309,   95% CI   [\u22120.717, 0.284]; HY:   r   = 0.439,   p   = 133,   95% CI   [\u22120.173, 0.860]), gender was also not included as an additional covariate. To avoid violations of the assumption of normality, we used bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrapping (with 5000 iterations) whenever possible. However, bootstrapping is not implemented for repeated measures ANOVA in SPSS. Nevertheless, according to simulation studies, ANOVAs are robust against the violation of this assumption ( ).   P  -values were corrected with the FDR method whenever necessary to account for multiple testing. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Data \n  \nMixed ANOVA yielded a significant within-subject effect   condition  . Memory performance varied with the extent of interference during consolidation across groups [  F  (2,54) = 6.901,   p   = 0.002,   \u03b7   = 0.204]. Pairwise comparisons indicated a significantly decreased memory performance in the interference relative to both the control and reminder conditions (both   p-FDR   < 0.018). However, there was no significant difference in memory performance between the control and reminder conditions (  p-FDR   = 0.450). In addition, the effect   group   was significant with better memory performance in HY compared to HS across conditions [  F  (1,27) = 26.509,   p   < 0.0001,   \u03b7   = 0.495] ( ). ANOVA revealed no significant   condition  *  group   interaction (  p   > 0.05). \n  \nDifferences between groups and conditions   (A)   regarding spatial context memory performance in percent correct and   (B)   inhibition capacity operationalized in   d  -prime [z(correct retrieval)\u2013z(intrusions)]. CON, control condition; RE, reminder condition; INT, interference condition; HY, healthy young; HS, healthy seniors. *  p   < 0.05;   p   < 0.01;   p   < 0.001. \n  \nIn the interference condition, 48.54% of the total number of mistakes were classified as intrusions. Considering that the chance probability for this kind of mistake among all possible false responses was 1/3, the percentage of intrusions was significantly above chance (test score: 33.33%,   t  (28) = 5.437,   p   < 0.001,   95% CI   [9.377, 20.403],   Cohen\u2019s d   = 1.01, one-sample   t  -test). HS showed significantly more total intrusions than HY [  t  (27) = \u22122.193,   p   = 0.037,   95% CI  [\u221210.973, \u22121.231],   Cohen\u2019s d   = \u22120.819, two-sample   t  -test]. \n\nUsing   d  -prime, the number of intrusions was related to the number of correctly remembered object-location associations in the interference condition. A two-sample   t  -test showed a significant difference in d-prime between groups, indicating a negative d-prime for HS and a positive d-prime for HY [  t  (27) = 3.209,   p   = 0.007,   95% CI   [0.673, 3.359],   Cohen\u2019s d   = 1.198] ( ). \n\n\n### Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data \n  \n#### Fractional Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations Analysis \n  \nThe comparison of fALFF during the resting-state sessions of the control condition revealed an increase in resting-state activity from R1 to R3 within (1) the right lingual gyrus (LG), (2) left occipital pole (OP), (3) left LG, and (4) right OP and a decrease within the (1) left supramarginal gyrus (SMG), (2) right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and (3) left precuneus (Pc). Further comparisons between R1 and R2 and R2 and R3 revealed overlapping but less significant results ( ). The comparison of fALFF during the resting-state sessions of the interference condition revealed a decrease in resting-state activity from R1 to R2 in the SMG, precuneus, superior frontal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus. A significant decrease in activity in the precuneus was also observed from R2 to R3. Comparing R1 to R3 only an increase in resting-state activity was observed in the right occipital pole ( ). \n  \nConsolidation-specific resting-state activity. \n      \nEffect of interference on consolidation-related resting-state activity. \n    \nInteraction analyses for the control condition showed no significant results. However, at a lower threshold, group differences in the interaction became apparent, covering regions for which we also observed changes in resting-state activity across groups ( ). The interaction analyses for the interference condition showed a significantly higher decrease in activity from R2 to R3 in the left SMG and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) for HY compared to HS ( ). \n  \nInteraction analyses with factors session and group for CON RS activity. \n      \nInteraction analyses with factors session and group for INT RS activity. \n    \nRegression analysis showed that consolidation-related resting-state activity changes within the right MTG significantly predicted memory performance in the control condition. Further within-group analyses confirmed this relationship for HY but not for HS (  and  ). For HY, a greater decrease in resting-state activity from CON R1 to CON R3 was associated with better memory performance. Resting-state activity changes in the other consolidation-related brain regions did not significantly predict memory performance. For the interference condition, no resting-state activity changes within consolidation-related brain regions could predict memory performance or inhibition capacity (all   p   > 0.05). \n  \nRegression analysis showed that consolidation-related resting-state (RS) activity changes in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) from pre-(R1) to post-encoding rest (R3) predict memory performance in the control condition (CON), for HY (healthy young) but not for HS (healthy seniors). *  p   < 0.05. \n  \n\n#### Region of Interest-to-Region of Interest Analysis \n  \nA one-sample   t  -test for the ROI-to-ROI correlation coefficients of the R3 session of the control condition, including both groups, showed positive and negative coupling of consolidation-related regions with nodes of large-scale brain networks during early memory consolidation. Of particular importance was the integration of the SMG-seed into the salience network (SN) and the anticorrelation to parts of the default mode network (DMN). On the other hand, the Pc-seed was strongly connected to nodes of the memory network and the DMN, and showed an anticorrelation to large parts of the SN. In addition, there was strong connectivity of OP and LG of both hemispheres with each other and with nodes of the visual network. The left LG, right OP, and right LG also positively correlated with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) as a core region of the DMN ( ; for FDR-corrected   p  -values, see  ). \n  \nROI-to-ROI connectivity matrix for the R3 session of the control condition.

However, the correlations of ROI-to-ROI associations with memory performance did not survive FDR correction across seeds. Applying a more liberal threshold (  p   < 0.05), this network extended to additional nodes within occipital and temporal regions.

Thus, negative coupling predicted better memory performance and lower interference susceptibility (  and  ). However, the correlations of the ROI-to-ROI associations with memory performance and interference susceptibility did not survive FDR correction across seeds.

The contrasts between pre-encoding and immediate post-encoding rest as well as immediate and delayed post-encoding rest revealed overlapping but less significant results. Thus, we conclude that resting-state activity changes successively with the progression of early memory consolidation. \n\nThe brain regions defined as consolidation-related on the basis of our results are consistent with findings of previous studies showing that these regions are of central importance for episodic memory ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ).   found similar brain regions to be correlated with spontaneous brain activity in the primary visual area (PVA) at rest. FC was observed for the occipital poles with the visual association areas (including LG), the Pc, the inferior/middle temporal gyrus, and the parahippocampal gyrus. Based on the functional attribution of these regions, Wang and colleagues suggested that PVA-related spontaneous activity could be attributed to memory-related mental imagery or visual consolidation. Because in our study resting-state activity was observed at rest and in contrast between pre- and post-encoding rest, our results provide further evidence for this hypothesis. We conclude that the coactivation of regions within a parieto-occipito-temporal network is central for consolidation processes, both in younger and older adults. \n\nIn the right MTG, resting-state activity changes predicted memory performance, but only in younger individuals. Therefore, it can be assumed that changes in resting-state activity within a parieto-occipito-temporal network, as a neurophysiological mechanism underlying consolidation, becomes at least partially less efficient with age and thus less predictive of episodic memory performance. \n\nSubsequent FC analyses revealed comparable integration of consolidation-related brain regions (MTG, Pc, SMG, bilateral LG, and OP) into large-scale brain networks for younger and older individuals. We observed integration of the SMG-seed into the SN and anticorrelation to parts of the DMN. On the other hand, the Pc-seed was firmly integrated into the memory network and the DMN and negatively correlated to large parts of the SN. In addition, bilateral LG and OP seeds were highly intercorrelated and correlated with the visual network. We also observed FC of the right MTG seed with occipital and inferior-temporal regions, forming a visual ventral stream network, for which we observed a positive correlation with memory performance. The association was stronger in younger than older individuals, suggesting a decrease in the efficiency of this network for consolidation processes with age, subsequently leading to aging-related memory decline. \n\nThe two-stream hypothesis states that two distinct systems process visual sensory input. The dorsal stream is associated with processing the spatial location of the object relative to the perceiver. In contrast, the ventral visual stream, which leads from the primary visual area to the temporal lobe, is associated with the processing and recognition of objects ( ). Recent research found stimulus-specific reactivation during post-encoding rest in visual areas that propagated along the ventral stream and predicted performance in a subsequent memory task ( ). Interestingly,   found an age-related decrease in FC between the middle temporal gyrus and the ventral visual stream but failed to observe a correlation with behavioral performance. Thus, our results complement previous research, as we observed a correlation with memory performance for the FC of the MTG with bilateral lingual gyrus and calcarine sulcus. More importantly, our results extend those previous studies by showing further FC between the bilateral occipital pole, bilateral lingual gyrus, right lateral occipital gyrus, and calcarine sulcus as predictive for memory performance, with a more robust memory prediction for younger compared to older individuals. \n\nIt could be assumed that FC within the visual ventral stream network represents the neurophysiological correlate of ongoing mental imagery processes of the material to be subsequently retrieved or visual working memory. However, since even in the control condition the consolidation phase was interrupted by a sensory task unrelated to the material to be consolidated, the data suggest that the neural activity and connectivity during the post-encoding rest does not merely represent working memory processes but is attributable to memory consolidation. \n\nFurthermore, our results show that the FC between the salience, central executive, and default mode networks can predict memory performance. Better memory performance was associated with lower negative FC between the Pc, a core region of the DMN, and parts of the SN. In contrast, higher negative FC between the SMG, as a core region of the SN, and parts of the CEN, was associated with better memory performance. On the other hand,   found age-related dynamic reorganization exclusively between the DMN and the executive network during post-encoding rest, but no association of these dynamics with the salience network. However, previous research suggests that the SN serves as a switch between the DMN and CEN ( ). In contrast to the DMN, which is primarily active at rest ( ), the CEN shows activation during complex cognitive tasks and high wakefulness ( ). Consistent with the triple network model of  , our results suggest that an SN-mediated switch between DMN and CEN occurs during consolidation. As in our study the relationship between the three networks allowed for better prediction of memory performance in younger compared to older adults, we hypothesize that this consolidation-induced shift in the competition between large brain networks becomes less efficient with age. \n\nWe suggest that with increasing age, the neural mechanisms underlying consolidation do not decrease in quantity but quality concerning the effectiveness of the neural mechanisms for successful consolidation. Thus, we conclude that with increasing age, the effectiveness of resting-state activity within the MTG, FC between regions in the visual ventral stream, and FC between SN, DMN, and CEN decrease, contributing to aging-related memory decline. \n\n\n### Between-Network Connectivity Predicts Aging-Related Increase in Interference Susceptibility \n  \nOur results for the interference condition showed a decrease in activity from pre-encoding to immediate post-encoding rest before the interference task within frontal regions, the SMG and Pc. This decrease in activity is consistent with the results from the control condition. After the interference task, however, divergent results emerge. In particular, there is no significant change in resting-state activity within the SMG, MTG, and LG. However, the successive decrease in activity within the precuneus is consistent with our results from the control condition. These findings suggest that the interference task suppresses some but not all of the neural mechanisms underlying consolidation. \n\nFurthermore, our results showed reduced negative coupling between the Pc as a core region of the DMN and parts of the SN and reduced positive coupling between the Pc and the PVA/OP after interference for both younger and older adults. Accordingly, while interference does not affect the resting-state activity within the Pc, its integration into functional networks seems to be disturbed by interference. \n\nThis assumption is further supported by the results of the correlation analyses with memory performance and interference susceptibility. We observed a predictive value of the FC between the Pc, as a core region of the DMN, and bilateral RPFC, as parts of the SN, in older but not in younger individuals. Accordingly, our results provide a behavioral correlate for the neural mechanisms of consolidation modulated by interference. Since our behavioral analyses showed that younger individuals could suppress the interfering position in most cases, whereas older individuals were unable to do so, it could be speculated that due to compensatory neural mechanisms relevant to inhibition capacity, memory performance in younger individuals cannot be predicted by the FC of the Pc. \n\nOverall, our results provide evidence that interference disrupts the neuronal processes of memory consolidation leading to impaired retrieval performance. Although the activity changes during the consolidation phase within the Pc persist after interference, our results nevertheless show that the FC of the precuneus with the salience network changes due to interference. In particular, the link to the salience network seems to be of great relevance for inhibition capacity, as it shows a predictive value for the memory performance of the older individuals, which is particularly weakened by interference. \n\n\n### Repeated Reactivation Might Cause Reconsolidation \n  \nRepeated reactivation of activity patterns from encoding is thought to be a central consolidation mechanism ( ). In the current study, repeated presentation of stimuli at a neutral position during consolidation was meant to serve as a cued reminder of the original position during encoding, leading to repeated reactivation and thus better memory performance. However, this hypothesis could not be confirmed, as memory performance after the cued reminders was not better but worse. The concept of reconsolidation provides a possible explanation. Memories are reactivated upon retrieval or by a reminder and thus become unstable and prone to interference before a reconsolidation process re-establishes stability ( ). Previous research suggests that memories explicitly brought to consciousness, as in the present study, induce reconsolidation ( ). \n\nWe hypothesize that the cued reminders presentation in the current study led to the reactivation of the memory trace already formed during the post-encoding rest period before the intervention (R2). Therefore, the memory traces became unstable again and had to be re-consolidated. However, when the cued reminder was presented implicitly, and thus reactivation occurred spontaneously, it could provide a central mechanism for memory consolidation and strengthen the stabilization of the memory trace, as several studies showed ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Strengths and Limitations \n  \nThis study is the first to investigate the effect of gradually manipulated interference on consolidation processes in aging. In three conditions, the extent to which interference challenged consolidation was varied. To ensure a standardized protocol across the three conditions, post-encoding rest had to be interrupted by a distracting task in each condition, which challenged consolidation processes even in the control condition. However, the stimuli of the distracting task in the control condition were scrambled pictures unrelated to the learned material. Therefore, retroactive interference with the stimuli or their position from the encoding task in the control condition is highly unlikely. Moreover, this task ensured that the neural mechanisms involved during the post-encoding rest could be attributed to consolidation rather than working memory processes. Additionally, a resting period without sensory input after learning is scarce in everyday life. Therefore, the control condition in the present study might more adequately reflect conditions outside the experimental environment than a period of wakeful rest without any sensory input. \n\nIn the present study, interference concerned the spatial context of the objects initially presented in the encoding task. Therefore, memory performance was operationalized as the number of correctly recalled object positions. On the one hand, this is consistent with previous studies showing that spatial context memory is particularly sensitive to aging effects ( ;  ). On the other hand, memory performance served as a behavioral correlate for successful consolidation. However, it can be assumed that the spatial context and the objects themselves were encoded and consolidated. Therefore, memory performance for the spatial context does not seem to be an entirely sufficient indicator of successful consolidation. Future studies should consider object memory in addition to spatial context memory. \n\nFurthermore, performance in a delayed retrieval task does not represent an entirely sufficient indicator of successful memory consolidation since it does not allow differentiation between successful encoding and consolidation. Concerning the memory paradigm in the current study, there may be three reasons why the position of the stimuli in the memory task was not remembered correctly: (1) The information was not encoded in the first place, i.e., during the learning phase this information was not consciously perceived, which is why it was not transferred to short-term memory; (2) the information was forgotten because it was not or not sufficiently consolidated and thus did not enter long-term memory; and (3) the information was overwritten (3a) either already during the learning phase by subsequent learning content or (3b) during the intervention task in the consolidation phase (retroactive interference). Future studies should additionally include an immediate retrieval task before consolidation. First, the performance of an immediate retrieval task could provide information about successful encoding. Second, a difference score between performance on an immediate and a delayed recall task would provide greater specificity as an indicator of successful memory consolidation and could provide insight into how much of the learning material, after it has been successfully encoded, is forgotten later in the process. \n\nMemory consolidation can take days, whereas in the present study, the consolidation phase had to be terminated after 14 min for temporal economic reasons. However, our data contribute to a growing body of literature by showing that system-level consolidation, i.e., dynamics between large-scale brain networks, occurs immediately after encoding and is related to successful consolidation in terms of better memory performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate, without   a priori   assumptions, resting-state activity and, based on this, connectivity between large-scale brain networks. Since memory consolidation processes are difficult to assess as they are not associated with any task but occur spontaneously during wakeful rest or sleep, we consider our methodological approach valuable to the field. \n\nFinally, the sample size is small and the results must be interpreted cautiously. In terms of reliable statistical effects, this study follows a within-subjects design, which reduces the number of subjects needed. In addition, potential confounding variables were thoroughly controlled, and conclusions were drawn based on robust results. Additionally, it is important to point out a methodological limitation regarding spatial smoothing. Although a larger kernel size is recommended for smaller samples, it can also lead to a shift in the local maxima. For our chosen kernel size of 8mm, an average shift of the local maxima of up to 5mm can be expected compared to a kernel size of 6mm. This fact must be taken into account when considering the reported results ( ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur findings indicate that deficits in episodic memory are not only due to altered neural processes during encoding and retrieval but at least partly due to impaired consolidation. Our results demonstrate that FC within a visual ventral stream network and between SN, DMN, and CEN underlying early consolidation becomes increasingly inefficient with age. Furthermore, our results indicate an accelerated susceptibility for retroactive interference in older individuals with specific dynamics between the SN and DMN as a neurophysiological correlate. The present findings serve as a basis for future studies investigating reconsolidation processes and possible compensatory mechanisms regarding inefficient consolidation and increased interference susceptibility. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article are provided by the authors without reservation.

This paradigm is optimized for mapping multiple contrasts using a mixed design, using auditory (environmental/vocal) and visual (scene/face) stimuli. We demonstrate that the paradigm evokes robust neuronal activity in typical sensory and memory networks. We were able to detect auditory and visual sensory-specific encoding activities in auditory and visual cortices. Also, we detected stimulus-selective activation in environmental-, voice-, scene-, and face-selective brain regions (parahippocampal place and fusiform face area). A subsequent recognition task allowed the detection of sensory-specific encoding success activity (ESA) in both auditory and visual cortices, as well as sensory-unspecific positive ESA in the hippocampus. Further, sensory-unspecific negative ESA was observed in the precuneus. Among others, the parallel mixed design enabled sustained and transient activity comparison in contrast to rest blocks. Sustained and transient activations showed great overlap in most sensory brain regions, whereas several regions, typically associated with the default-mode network, showed transient rather than sustained deactivation. We also show that the use of a parallel mixed model had relatively little influence on positive or negative ESA. Together, these results demonstrate a feasible, versatile, and brief memory-encoding task, which includes multiple sensory stimuli to guarantee a comprehensive measurement. This task is especially suitable for large-scale clinical or population studies, which aim to test task-evoked sensory-specific and sensory-unspecific memory-encoding performance as well as broad sensory activity across the life span within a very limited time frame. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nWith neurodegenerative diseases as one of the main challenges in aging populations, the precise, comprehensive, and robust measurement of cognitive functions is of great importance. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one measurement that helps us to bridge the space between biology and behavioral outcomes. Several large-scale studies have employed fMRI to map brain activity in the general population, including the Rotterdam Study (Hofman et al.,  ), UK Biobank (Miller et al.,  ), and the Rhineland Study (Breteler et al.,  ). These large-scale population studies are usually not designed to answer one specific hypothesis. Rather, they aim to perform an extensive and deep phenotyping that allows addressing multiple questions. As they are mostly prospective studies, they also need to anticipate future questions. Therefore, tasks and paradigms should ideally be as versatile as possible. In the absence of a specific hypothesis, resting-state fMRI is often employed, mostly for practical considerations, as it is rather easy to apply and can also inform about neural dysfunction (Damoiseaux and Huijbers,  ). Task-evoked fMRI provides complementary information, that is, the brain's response to specific demands (Campbell and Schacter,  ; Davis et al.,  ), and evokes activity in cortical networks under more restrained conditions (Vanderwal et al.,  ; Huijbers et al.,  ). Therefore, task fMRI is often considered. However, most conventional task paradigms are not easily applied in clinical or large-scale population studies (Pinel et al.,  ) for the following reasons. \n\nFirst, conventional task paradigms from cognitive neuroscience are typically developed and applied in experimental studies that pose less time constraints than population studies. However, in clinical or large-scale population studies, acquisition time is often more restricted, as the burden to participants, or patients, should be limited and costs add up easily. Additionally, fMRI acquisition time typically competes with anatomical or clinically motivated MRI sequences, including T1, T2, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), perfusion, and diffusion (Jack et al.,  ; Glasser et al.,  ). Thus, to be feasible for clinical or population-based imaging, a task paradigm should be as time-efficient as possible. \n\nSecond, conventional fMRI task paradigms have often been developed in homogenous cohorts of young adults. In a large-scale population or clinical studies, the cohort of participants is typically more heterogeneous with respect to age, education, lifestyle, and health factors. This heterogeneity can result in problems when task instructions are tailored to a specific age group (such as young adults). As a consequence, paradigms might show ceiling and/or floor effects for subgroups. Thus, an ideal paradigm should have very simple or no instructions and yet remain informative across the entire cohort. \n\nFinally, conventional task paradigms are typically designed to answer a specific hypothesis, often from the field of cognitive neuroscience. As mentioned above, large-scale, population-based studies mostly aim to employ fMRI to estimate neuronal activity related to multiple research questions or outcomes at the same time. An ideal task paradigm for population-based studies should permit the analysis of multiple contrasts that span a wide range of cognitive functions. \n\nTo address these various requirements, we designed a novel task paradigm that we consider especially suited for large-scale studies. It measures predominantly memory encoding, but also perception and attention in both the auditory and visual domains within 10 min of fMRI acquisition time using simple instructions. To our knowledge, memory-encoding paradigms so far presented stimuli of one sensory condition or did face\u2013name associative memory tasks (Sperling,  ; Barch et al.,  ; Nenert et al.,  ; Sidhu et al.,  ; Hayes et al.,  ) within a similar time frame. We optimized our task to allow mapping of a versatile number of contrasts that are relatively straightforward to interpret. To enable the separation of sensory-specific and sensory-unspecific activities (Wheeler et al.,  ; Daselaar et al.,  ; Langner et al.,  ), we used two sensory modalities, auditory and visual. Twenty-five percent of the total time consisted of passive rest blocks as baseline/rest condition (Gusnard and Raichle,  ). Each sensory condition contained two distinct sub-conditions to cover a wide range of information on visual and auditory system activations as well as joined activation for sensory-unspecific functions like overall memory. Within the visual condition, we chose to present faces and spatial scenes, motivated by work on face-selective and scene-selective brain regions (Kanwisher et al.,  ; Epstein and Kanwisher,  ; Gazzaley et al.,  ; Collins and Dickerson,  ). Further, those stimuli seemed to show differences in age-related reductions in neural dedifferentiation, which makes them interesting for longitudinal studies (Srokova et al.,  ). To select auditory stimuli on a similar level of specificity, we chose voice and environmental stimuli motivated by previous work on voice-selective brain regions (Belin et al.,  ,  ; Pernet et al.,  ; Agus et al.,  ; Z\u00e4ske et al.,  ; Aglieri et al.,  ). This decision was further supported by studies showing that similarities as well as differences exist between the regional activation of voice and face perception (Young et al.,  ). Due to the simplicity of the design and to keep the paradigm language free, we did not include language stimuli. A post-fMRI recognition test, with previously seen/heard and novel items, enables the computation of contrasts between subsequently remembered (hit) and forgotten (miss) items (Wagner et al.,  ; Otten and Rugg,  ; Prince et al.,  ; Collins and Dickerson,  ). In the following, we will refer to these contrasts as encoding success activity (ESA). We used a parallel mixed block/event design to include a large number of stimuli within a limited time and to enable the already versatile number of contrasts also for the separation of sustained (block) and transient (event) activities (Velanova et al.,  ; Visscher et al.,  ; Petersen and Dubis,  ). Differentiating both can help to get a more complex understanding of the functional processes underlying a task. Sustained effects give more information about the maintenance of activity throughout a set of stimuli, for example, representing also overall attentional performance or arousal, whereas transient effects are specific for each trial of a task (Visscher et al.,  ). \n\nThereby, our task allows a large degree of flexibility to analyze the data in multiple ways with regard to other outcomes of interest. This is important in studies spanning years to decades, as research questions and analysis techniques change over time. In this study, we introduce our task paradigm and demonstrate several possible analyses to generate a range of different behavioral and neuronal measures relating to perception and memory encoding. These outcome measures are then available for further analyses in the context of the overall population study. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe recruited 60 young adults between the ages of 19 and 30 years (  M   = 24.18,   SD   = 2.90; 36 females), from the University of Bonn community in the context of the pilot studies for the Rhineland Study, a prospective cohort study. The study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards (ICH-GCP). We obtained written informed consent from all participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. No incentives were offered to the participants. The medical ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Bonn approved the study. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Hearing levels were calibrated individually before the experiment, for the sounds to be easily audible above the scanner noise. For one participant, visual retrieval data were not available in the fMRI analysis. ESA contrasts for this participant were therefore analyzed only on the basis of the auditory retrieval information. To detect possible floor effects of the task, we obtained behavioral task data of 21 persons older than 30 years (  M   = 52.71,   SD   = 15.55; age range = 31\u201377; 12 females) (see   \u201cBehavioral results in older adults\u201d). \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nA total of 160 auditory and 160 visual items were presented during the encoding task. Auditory stimuli had durations between 538 and 2,771 ms (  M   = 1,630 ms,   SD   = 488 ms) and consisted of 80 environmental and 80 human vocal sounds. The environmental sounds included a mix of sounds from animals, traffic, tools, and musical instruments, selected from previous auditory experiments (Belin et al.,  ; Daselaar et al.,  ; Huijbers et al.,  ). The vocal sounds consisted of vocal utterances, void of semantic content, such as laughing, crying, or coughing, selected from previous experiments, from the Oxford Vocal (OxVoc) Sounds database (Belin et al.,  ; Parsons et al.,  ) or were recorded for the purpose of this study. The recordings were from various male and female voices. Duration of the auditory stimuli was not equalized, because some are by nature rather short but nevertheless distinct, whereas others need a longer duration to be distinct (e.g., cockcrow/doorbell vs. laughter/wind). To match stimuli for low-level physical properties, we normalized all auditory stimuli to the same amplitude using version 2.0.6 of Audacity\u00ae recording and editing software. The visual items consisted of color photographs of 80 faces (size 570 \u00d7 360 pixels) and 80 scenes (size 500 \u00d7 375 pixels) on a black background. Face stimuli contained faces from individuals with various ethnicities, between 18 and 90 years of age, with an equal number of male and female faces selected from previous experiments (Sperling et al.,  ; Minear and Park,  ; Huijbers et al.,  ). Scenes were pictures from nature or urban outdoor environments selected from Huijbers et al. ( ). Colors from the original scenic images were slightly de-saturated to match the color contrast in the facial images. \n\nFrom all available stimuli, we selected the final set of 160 stimuli with the aim to reach a hit-rate of ~50% (for an explanation, see section Behavioral Analysis) and a false alarm (FA) rate as low as possible. \n\nAuditory stimuli were presented via S14 Insert Earphones (Sensimetrics, Malden, USA). Visual stimuli were presented on a screen located at the head of the magnet bore and seen via a mirror mounted on the head coil. All stimuli were presented using PsychoPy software v1.82 (Peirce,  ), running on a Windows PC. \n\n\n### MRI Acquisition \n  \nfMRI data were acquired with a 3-Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma system (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany). The scanner was equipped with a 64-channel phased-array head/neck coil. We used inflatable air pads to restrict head movement, and participants were instructed to lie still for the duration of the scan. For the applicability in large-scale testing, we decided on a standard fMRI scanning protocol: we acquired two task fMRI sessions of 140 volumes using echo-planar imaging (EPI), including four dummies. Each volume consisted of 32 axial slices of 3-mm thickness with a 0.75-mm gap. The repetition time (TR) was 2,000 ms, echo time (TE) was 30 ms, flip angle was 84\u00b0, readout bandwidth was 2,300 Hz/pixel, the slice orientation was anterior commissure\u2013posterior commissure (AC-PC), and field of view (FOV) was 192 \u00d7 192 mm, resulting in an effective voxel size of 3.0 \u00d7 3.0 \u00d7 3.75 mm. \n\n\n### Task Design and Implementation \n  \nThe task was designed as a mixed model (Visscher et al.,  ) and included 180 events (trials), grouped into 32 blocks ( ). Out of these 32 blocks, eight were rest blocks (fixation), eight isolated auditory blocks, eight isolated visual blocks, and eight parallel auditory/visual blocks. Sixteen blocks contained auditory stimuli, half isolated auditory and half parallel with visual images. Of these 16 blocks, eight blocks contained environmental sounds (four isolated and four parallel), and eight blocks contained vocal sounds (four isolated and four parallel). Similarly, for the visual blocks, half were presented in isolation and half in parallel with sounds (scene and face images equally distributed). In each block, five items\u2014sounds, images, or both\u2014were presented for a total of 16 s per block ( ). Within the auditory blocks, the inter-trial interval between items was 200\u20132,700 ms. Within the visual stimulus blocks, the inter-trial interval between items was 200\u20132,200 ms. The difference in the inter-trial intervals between auditory and visual blocks is due to the variable duration of sounds. Each image was presented for exactly 2,000 ms. Inter-trial intervals as well as the order of blocks and the order of stimuli within the blocks were once randomly assigned and remained the same for all participants. A white fixation cross on black background was shown during the rest blocks, the inter-trial intervals, the isolated auditory blocks, and the initial and final 8 s of each run. By design, we tried to ensure that the different blocks and items would result in separate, uncorrelated regressors (see section Parallel Mixed Model Analysis). As we cannot predetermine which items will be remembered or forgotten, we also evaluated the collinearity of the regressors after data collection (see section Parallel Mixed Model Analysis). \n  \nScheme of the task paradigm.   (A)   The order of presented stimuli and sensory conditions. \u201cOn\u201d represents presentation of the stimuli, and \u201cOff\u201d represents no presentation of the stimuli. Each block contains five stimuli of one category and lasted 16 s. In parallel conditions, five auditory and five visual stimuli are presented in one block. The auditory events consisted of environmental or vocal stimuli (see auditory timeline). The visual events consisted of face or scene stimuli (see visual timeline; faces were not pixelated in the original task).   (B)   Four exemplary blocks in detail. \n  \nThe task presentation was distributed over two sessions (containing the same number of blocks for each stimulus and presentation condition) of 4:54 min each separated by a short question about the participants' well-being. At the beginning of these sessions, participants were given written instructions via the screen to pay attention to the sounds and images (\u201cplease watch and listen carefully\u201d). No motor responses were required in our task, which had several advantages. Apart from keeping the task simple, movement artifacts during scanning were minimized. Also, the lack of motor activity facilitates the interpretation of sensory and memory-related fMRI data across the life span (Yarkoni et al.,  ; Viswanathan et al.,  ). \n\nBefore the fMRI sessions, vision and hearing abilities were corrected to normal, by using MRI-compatible glasses and a volume adjustment during the initial scout scan, respectively. Following the scout scan, participants did a very short training session of eight visual and eight auditory items including encoding and retrieval, to get acquainted with the task procedures and to ensure they understood the instructions. Our following encoding task was therefore explicit. After completing the two memory-encoding sessions, participants' memory retrieval was tested by two separate subsequent memory tests. Recognition of auditory stimuli was tested first, followed by a visual recognition test. Across the auditory and visual recognition tests, 160 previously encoded (old) and 160 novel (new) items were presented (80 environmental sounds/80 vocal sounds/80 face images/80 scene images). The participants responded with two buttons (\u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d) to a forced-choice question (in German): \u201cDid you hear/see this item previously?\u201d (\u201cHaben Sie das Ger\u00e4usch bereits geh\u00f6rt?\u201d or \u201cHaben Sie das Bild bereits gesehen?\u201d). The recognition tests were self-paced, and items were presented in blocks. In each block, five old items (previously encoded) and five new items were presented in a random order. In each block, items were of the same type. Across the blocks, the presentation order of the encoding intervals was maintained to ensure an approximately equal time distance between encoding and retrieval. Both recognition tests were done inside the MRI bore immediately after the encoding runs. The auditory recognition test was done during a diffusion MRI scan, and the visual recognition test was performed during an anatomical T1-MPRAGE scan. Diffusion and anatomical MRI data are not included in this manuscript, yet some of that data have been examined in relation to head motion (Huijbers et al.,  ). The fMRI and behavioral data in this paper have not been published previously. All task scripts are uploaded under  . \n\n\n### Behavioral Analysis \n  \nBehavioral analyses were implemented in R v3.3.2 ( ). To quantify memory performance, we examined the percentage of correct responses for previously presented items (labeled as hit-rate) and the percentage of incorrect responses for new items (labeled as FA-rate). We also calculated the discriminability index d-prime (  d  \u2032), by taking the z-standardized hit-rate minus the z-standardized FA-rate. Additionally, we calculated the response bias (  c  ) by taking the sum of the z-standardized hit- and FA-rates multiplied by \u22120.5. Differences between hit- and FA-rates were calculated using paired and two-sided   t  -tests. A one-sample   t  -test was used to examine the response bias. To assess the main effects and the possible interaction between sensory modality (auditory/visual) and presentation condition (isolated/parallel) on memory performance, we used an ANOVA. Correlation analyses described in the supplements employ Pearson's method, unless otherwise indicated. Reliability analysis was done by splitting up the task into its two sessions (for details, see   \u201cAnalysis of reliability\u201d) and calculating the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) (Shrout and Fleiss,  ; McGraw and Wong,  ) with a two-way model using single units for each participant, estimating the consistency between the two sessions. \n\n\n### Functional MRI Preprocessing \n  \nfMRI data were preprocessed using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), the Statistical Parametric Mapping Toolbox (SPM8, UCL, London, UK), and GLM Flex (MGH,  , MA, USA). First, we dropped the four dummy volumes. Second, we realigned the time series to the first volume. Third, we normalized the data to a standard EPI template in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 space. Fourth, we smoothed the data with a full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) kernel of 8 mm. For assessing the reliability, we split the task into two sessions (for details see   \u201cAnalysis of reliability\u201d) calculated on the basis of the slice time-corrected and normalized data. We calculated ICC values before smoothing the data, using a publicly available online script for MATLAB by C. Pernet ( , downloaded 8th February 2018). After calculating the ICCs on the voxel level, we smoothed the group-level ICC maps with a FWHM kernel of 8 mm for visualization purposes, as this makes it easier to appreciate the spatial overlap between the contrast and the ICC map. \n\n\n### Parallel Mixed Model Analysis \n  \nThe subject-level analyses were conducted in SPM8. For the main analyses, the SPM regressors were modeled according to the parallel mixed block/event design (Visscher et al.,  ). In the  , we also added a model comparison where we modeled the task data according to a block-only design and an event-only design using the respective regressors separately (see   \u201cModel comparison between mixed, block- and event-only modeling\u201d). \n\nIn the mixed design, we included two block regressors: one for the auditory blocks and one for the visual blocks ( ). The block onsets were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function using the durations. Passive rest blocks (fixation) were not modeled explicitly. The block regressors were solely determined by the task design and therefore fixed across subjects. In addition, we also added eight unique event regressors, which were subject specific, as they were determined by the combination of the task design (stimulus type: environmental sounds/vocal sounds/face images/scene images) and the participants' performance on the subsequent memory tasks (memory performance: hit/miss) ( ). To avoid collinearity (Andrade et al.,  ), we included the parallel (auditory and visual) presentation condition in an equal amount to the isolated (auditory or visual) and rest (fixation) blocks to the task. In addition, we modeled blocks for both sensory conditions (auditory/visual), whereas events were modeled for each stimulus condition (environmental sounds/vocal sounds/scene images/face images) separately. To prevent correlations between regressors due to participants who remembered or forgot too many items (events) presented within one block, we aimed for a conservative response bias (see section Behavioral Results). This also ensured roughly equal hits/misses, so hits or misses did not dominate single blocks. After data collection, before the analysis, we checked the hemodynamic regressors for collinearity using a correlation analysis. All regressors have shown to be largely independent with   r   = 0.3 within sensory conditions and r around zero between sensory conditions. On average, the event-related regressors were modeled based on 20.65 environmental hits (  SD   = 5.87), 19.25 environmental misses (  SD   = 5.77), 24.63 vocal hits (  SD   = 6.35), 15.30 vocal misses (  SD   = 6.30), 26.42 scene hits (  SD   = 6.16), 13.58 scene misses (  SD   = 6.16), 23.73 face hits (  SD   = 6.64), and 16.27 face misses (  SD   = 6.64). The event onsets were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function using no duration. Further, the subject-level models also included regressors for motion parameters, bad-volume regressors, and a high-pass filter (1/128 Hz). The bad volumes were defined by the amount of absolute movement in relation to the previous scans, using a threshold >0.75 mm or 1.5\u00b0 in one or more directions. \n  \nThe parallel mixed design consisted of two fixed block regressors, one for the auditory and one for the visual blocks, and eight subject-specific event regressors. These event-related regressors were determined by the combination of stimulus types, auditory (environmental/vocal) or visual (face/scene) and subsequent memory performance (hits/misses). Event regressors represent the SPM regressors of a single exemplary subject. \n  \nWe defined 10 contrasts. First, the block-based contrast was performed between auditory and visual blocks (c1) to assess activity caused by the different sensory conditions. Second, two event-related contrasts based on stimulus type was performed to assess within the sensory conditions differences between stimuli types: (c2) environmental sounds vs. vocal sounds masked by auditory activity greater than visual activity and (c3) face images vs. scene images masked by visual activity greater than auditory activity. Third, we defined ESA based on the events during isolated blocks: (c4) all (visual and auditory) hits vs. all misses (sensory-unspecific ESA), (c5) auditory hits vs. auditory misses (auditory ESA), and (c6) visual hits vs. visual misses (visual ESA). We included ESA only for each sensory type (auditory and visual stimuli), as we considered the type-specific ESA maps (environmental sounds, vocal sounds, scene images, and face images) to be too detailed and to have not enough trials. Fourth, we defined contrasts relative to the rest condition (fixation), to examine differences and similarities between sustained and transient activities: (c7) auditory blocks vs. rest, (c8) isolated auditory events vs. rest, (c9) visual blocks vs. rest, and (c10) isolated visual events vs. rest. \n\nFor all group maps, we used a global threshold of   p   < 0.05 [false discovery rate (FDR) corrected] with a minimum cluster size of five voxels (no cluster-size correction). The same threshold was used to define the masks for the conjunction analyses (c2/c3). Note that the remaining activities within the mask also had to survive the global threshold (  p   < 0.05, FDR corrected). Statistical group maps were projected to the cortical surface using FreeSurfer (v5.1) via a standard MNI to the FreeSurfer average template transformation or were resliced to 2.0 \u00d7 2.0 \u00d7 2.0 mm voxels and overlaid on the standard SPM8 individual T1-weighted volume. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Results \n  \nThe subsequent memory performance is listed in  . For each sensory and stimulus condition, the hit-rate was significantly greater than the FA-rate. These differences between the hit- and FA-rates indicate that participants were able to successfully encode items in each category. The duration of subsequent memory test was between 10 and 19 min. The auditory retrieval took on average 7.32 min (  SD   = 0.86, range 6.40\u201311.16) and visual retrieval 3.86 min (  SD   = 0.77, range 3.03\u20138.18). Within the auditory blocks, the inter-trial intervals for hits and misses were on average 1,556 ms (range 194\u20132,713 ms) and 1,509 ms (range 194\u20132,713 ms), respectively. Within visual blocks, the inter-trial intervals for hits and misses were on average 1,136 (range 200\u20132,200 ms) and 1,171 ms (range 200\u20132,200 ms), respectively. \n  \nMemory performance. \n  \n Mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) for hit-rate, false alarm (FA)-rate, and d-prime (d\u2032) (N = 60). Paired t-tests are used to depict differences between hit- and FA-rates and between d\u2032 of sensory and stimulus conditions. df indicates the degrees of freedom, t indicates the t-value, and p indicates the p-value representing the significance level  . \n  \nAcross all conditions, we found a   d  \u2032 of 1.19 (  SD   = 0.40) and a   c   of 0.34 (  SD   = 0.27) [auditory:   c   = 0.32 (  SD   = 0.33); visual:   c   = 0.39 (  SD   = 0.33)]. The response bias indicated that participants were relatively conservative [  t   = 9.59,   p   < 0.001] and thus more likely to rate items as \u201cnew.\u201d Paired   t  -tests indicated that memory performance was better for visual items compared with auditory items and for scene images better than for face images, but there was no difference in memory performance between environmental and vocal auditory stimuli ( ). Similar results, with slightly lower   d  \u2032 but a comparable response bias, have been observed for the small sample of older participants (see   \u201cBehavioral results in older adults\u201d). \n\nIn our paradigm, stimuli were presented either in isolation or in parallel with stimuli of the other sensory modality. We computed separate   d  \u2032 values for each of the presentation conditions (parallel/isolated) and sensory condition (auditory/visual).   d  \u2032 values for subsequent memory of auditory stimuli were   M   = 1.03 (  SD   = 0.51) and   M   = 0.95 (  SD   = 0.45) and for visual stimuli   d  \u2032 values of   M   = 1.69 (  SD   = 0.70) and   M   = 1.31 (  SD   = 0.60). Results of the ANOVA supported a better subsequent memory performance for visual than for auditory stimuli independent of the presentation condition (isolated/parallel) [  F   = 37.29,   p   < 0.001]. Also the presentation condition showed a main effect indicating a better subsequent memory performance for items presented in isolation independent of the sensory modality [  F   = 40.60,   p   < 0.001]. Further, we found an interaction effect between sensory modality and presentation condition [  F   = 25.62,   p   < 0.001], which suggested that the parallel presentation of auditory and visual items was more detrimental to learning of visual information than of auditory information. \n\n\n### Sensory-Specific Activity \n  \nFor the auditory blocks, we found the global maxima in the right auditory cortex and for the visual blocks in the left visual cortex ( ; c1). For the environmental sounds, the maxima were in the right temporoparietal junction, and for the vocal sounds, in the right superior temporal gyrus ( ; c2). For scenes, we found maxima in the left parahippocampal gyrus, and for faces, in the left fusiform gyrus ( ; c3). See sensory-specific activity in   for the MNI coordinates and values of the global maxima (activation) and minima (deactivations).   in the supplement provides cluster specific peaks for all contrasts. \n  \nTask-based activity contrasts between (Auditory vs. Visual) and within (Environmental vs. Vocal and Face vs. Scene) sensory conditions. (c1) Block-based contrast between auditory and visual stimulus blocks. (c2) Event-related contrast between environmental and vocal sounds masked by auditory greater visual activity (see c1). (c3) Event-related contrast between face and scene images masked by visual greater auditory activity (see c1). Brain activity is shown at a threshold of   p   < 0.05 [false discovery rate (FDR) corrected], and the color intensity shows the   t  -value. Contrast maps are uploaded under  . \n    \nMaximally activated and deactivated brain regions for each contrast. \n  \n Contrasts are as follows: c1, block-based contrast between auditory vs. visual stimulus blocks; c2, event-related contrast between environmental vs. vocal sounds; c3, event-related contrast between face vs. scene images; c4, ESA for all (visual and auditory) hits vs. all misses; c5, ESA for auditory hits vs. auditory misses; c6, ESA for visual hits vs. visual misses; c7, auditory vs. rest blocks; c9, visual vs. rest blocks; c8, auditory events vs. rest; and c10, visual events vs. rest. All brain regions are described with Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates [MNI ], t-values of the beta coefficients, and the related Brodmann area (BA). Contrast maps are uploaded under  . Positive ESA: hits > misses contrast; negative ESA: misses > hits contrast  . \n  \n\n### Encoding Success Activity \n  \nThe ESA contrast showed the greatest positive ESA (hits > misses) (global maximum) in the right hippocampus and the greatest negative ESA (misses > hits) (global minimum) in the right precuneus ( ; c4). For auditory items, we found the maximum positive ESA in left auditory cortex and the maximum negative ESA in the right precuneus ( ; c5). For visual items, we found the maximum positive ESA in the right visual cortex and the maximum negative ESA in the right precuneus ( ; c6). See ESA in   for the MNI coordinates and values and   for all cluster specific peaks. \n  \nBrain maps of sensory-unspecific encoding success activity (ESA), assessed through the contrasts between activity of subsequently remembered (hit) and subsequently forgotten (miss) stimuli of the isolated encoding condition. (c4) ESA across all conditions (auditory and visual). (c5) ESA of auditory stimuli. (c6) ESA of visual stimuli. Brain activity is shown at a threshold of   p   < 0.05 [false discovery rate (FDR) corrected], and the color intensity shows the   t  -value. Contrast maps are uploaded under  . \n  \nTogether, these maps demonstrate that positive ESA in the auditory and visual cortices is sensory-specific while the positive ESA in hippocampus and the negative ESA in the precuneus are sensory-unspecific. \n\n\n### Sustained and Transient Activations \n  \nTo clarify the patterns of sustained and transient activations, we mapped the block- and event-related activity vs. the rest condition for each sensory condition. For sustained (block-based) auditory activity, we found the global maxima in the right superior temporal lobe ( ; c7). For the transient (event-based) auditory activity, we found the maxima in the left primary auditory cortex ( ; c8). For sustained visual activity, we found the maxima in the primary visual cortex ( ; c9). Finally, for transient visual activity, we found the maxima in the right fusiform gyrus ( ; c10). For MNI coordinates and values, see sustained and transient section in  ; and for cluster specific peak activation, see  . We also examined the local minima (deactivations) of the same contrasts for which the results and images can be found in the   \u201cSustained and transient deactivation\u201d. \n  \nBrain maps of block-related (sustained) and event-related (transient) activations. (c7) Auditory block vs. rest activation (pink). (c8) Auditory event vs. rest activation (orange). (c9) Visual block vs. rest activation (pink). (c10) Visual block vs. rest activation (orange). Brain activity is shown at a threshold of   p   < 0.05 [false discovery rate (FDR) corrected], and the color intensity shows the   t  -value. Contrast maps are uploaded under  . \n  \nIn comparison with the results from the block-only or event-only models, mixed models show slightly different levels of activity in the regions of interest. The directionality and the appearance of the main effects stayed the same (see   \u201cModel comparison between mixed, block- and event-only modeling\u201d). \n\n\n### Reliability Analysis \n  \nICCs for all calculated behavioral outcomes in total (hit-rate, FA-rate, and d-prime) and separated for sensory and stimulus conditions ranged between 0.400 and 0.812, with the highest ICC in FA-rates and the lowest in stimulus-specific   d  \u2032 and hit-rates. Overall,   d  \u2032 showed an ICC of 0.675. Sensory-specific   d  \u2032 showed ICCs of 0.622 for auditory and 0.649 for visual stimuli. More detailed results are described in   \u201cAnalysis of reliability\u201d. \n\nSmoothened voxel-wise ICC analysis for the fMRI data revealed for all contrasts stronger reliability for regions that showed also high activation. In c1, the visual and auditory cortices showed the highest reliability with a global peak of ICC = 0.663 in the left middle occipital gyrus (MNI : \u221212, \u2212100, \u22121). In c2, ICCs are lower but still showed a global peak of ICC = 0.206 in the right auditory cortex (middle temporal gyrus, MNI : 57, \u221237, 5). In c3, ICC values had a similar range as in c1 with a global peak of ICC = 0.608 in the right fusiform gyrus (MNI : 33, \u221249, \u221210). C4 showed a maximum ICC of 0.306 in the right fusiform gyrus (MNI : 27, \u221282, \u221213). Other local peaks of ICC in c4 are found, for example, in the right hippocampus (ICC = 0.132, MNI : 15, \u22124, \u221216) and the left parahippocampal region (ICC = 0.230, MNI : \u221215, \u22124, \u221219). More detailed results are shown in the   \u201cReliability of sensory-specific and encoding success activity\u201d. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe demonstrate the feasibility of a parallel mixed design as an efficient strategy for acquisition of rich fMRI data in limited time. The acquired data can give information about sensory-specific brain activation as well as sensory-specific and sensory-unspecific memory performance (taking the behavioral retrieval task data into account) using the key contrasts c1 to c6. The additional contrasts c7 to c10 show that also information on the difference of sustained (block-based) and transient (event-based) models and resulting activation can be obtained. \n\n### Behavior \n  \nIn the retrieval task, participants showed a hit-rate close to 50%, which is optimal for ESA modeling, as it ensures a balanced number of observations on each side of the contrast (hits vs. misses). Furthermore, FA-rates were very low, which was reflected in a conservative response bias and resulted in   d  \u2032 values far above chance for each stimulus category (environmental and vocal sound, and scene and face images). The   d  \u2032 values far above chance suggested that the ESA contrast is driven by memory encoding and not guessing. Although the hit-rates were all close to 50%, we see slight differences between stimulus conditions ( ). Therefore, we cannot rule out completely that some stimulus conditions influenced the weighting and the ESA contrasts and caused small differences between the conditions. Due to the low number of stimuli and the between-subject variance, we did not have sufficient observations for reliable ESA in each separate stimulus category in this sample. If this task is applied in larger studies, there would be also interesting contrasts to examine. For now, we focused on examining auditory ESA, visual ESA, and (overall) ESA. \n\nAlready during task construction, we found visual memory performance to be superior for visual scenes compared with visual faces or sounds. This was despite our initial (design) objective to achieve balanced memory scores for each stimulus type. Given this objective, auditory retrieval was tested before visual retrieval, so the time delay between encoding and retrieval for visual stimuli was longer than for auditory stimuli. We enriched the auditory experience by using various speakers for the vocal sounds and the environmental sounds by presenting a large range of stimuli from animals to vehicles. Finally, we degraded the visual scenes slightly by desaturating the originally bright colors of the images (Huijbers et al.,  ). Nevertheless, memory performance for the visual items remained superior, especially for the scenes ( ). This finding replicated behavioral work that indicated better memory performance for visual scenes than for any kind of auditory stimuli (Cohen et al.,  ). In general, visual stimuli are more often remembered and with more detail in comparison with auditory memory, if recalled immediately (Thelen et al.,  ; Gloede and Gregg,  ). However, after a time delay, auditory memories are more stable than visual memory (Gloede and Gregg,  ). This may imply that it may be more difficult to encode auditory than visual stimuli. In addition, auditory stimuli were presented above the rhythmic scanner noise, whereas visual stimuli were presented in a dark and visually \u201cquiet\u201d environment. Although we took care to select stimuli that were distinctly different from the scanning sounds with regard to spectral and temporal structure, we must consider the possibility that some acoustic masking occurred. The noisy scanning environment creates additional challenges for the auditory system on several levels of processing, in particular for the detection of signal in noise as well as asking for greater attentional demands and efforts. With regard to applying this paradigm in studies with a wider age range, it must be considered that complex listening skills (such as processing speech in noise) decline with age even when controlling for overall hearing thresholds. Also, considering the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) effect, it is likely that the continuous scanner noise resulted in continuously high activity in the auditory areas, rendering it more difficult to detect more subtle effects of condition on top of this saturation effect (Tomasi et al.,  ). However, we decided against presenting auditory stimuli in quiet(er) pauses (between volumes), as such a sparse sampling paradigm would have significantly extended the scanning time. In future developments of such paradigms, and especially in studies including older adults, novel methodological approaches such as interleaved silent steady state or special scanning sequences that minimize acoustic impact could be considered [see methodological review by Peelle ( )]. \n\nLooking into differences between the two presentation conditions (isolation and parallel presentation), we also observed differences in memory performance. Isolated presentation resulted in better memory performance for both visual and auditory items. This is consistent with the model that memory encoding is limited by a working memory capacity (Baddeley,  ) and that it is impaired if semantically incongruent information is presented in parallel (Thelen et al.,  ). One interpretation is that divided attention between auditory and visual information is detrimental to encoding. Note that we tested the auditory and visual retrieval separately, and the information of the two parallel presented stimulus classes was not congruent. There is a large body of evidence that multisensory encoding of congruent information is beneficial for memory performance [Shams and Seitz,  ; Thelen et al.,  ), for review, see (Quak et al.,  )]. Therefore, depending on the scientific aim, one could adapt our paradigm and match voices with faces and scenes with environmental sounds. By doing so, memory performance is likely to improve at the expense of either the factorial design or a longer acquisition period. \n\nInterestingly, the relative difference between isolated and parallel encoding was not the same for auditory and visual stimuli. We found that visual memory performance declined more under parallel conditions, while auditory encoding was less hindered. This has also been found in a working memory study on isolated and parallel retention of auditory (vocal) and visual (abstract objects) information (Saults and Cowan,  ). Together with the finding from Gloede and Gregg (Gloede and Gregg,  ) that visual memory is more hindered by a delayed recall than auditory memory, this suggests that auditory encoding might be more difficult but relatively robust. One explanation for the robustness of auditory encoding over the presentation conditions might also be related to the noisy scanner environment, creating continuously higher demands on auditory processing during both presentation conditions, as discussed above. This might have reduced the size of the effect of additional between-modality parallel processing for the auditory stimuli. A second explanation could be that learning auditory stimuli in similar detail as visual memory is more difficult and takes more attentional effort (Gloede and Gregg,  ). Therefore, parallel conditions that demand more attention influence auditory information less than visual memory. \n\nAs discussed above,   d  \u2032 values showed that the participant's memory scores were far above chance. Within the young adults, we did not find ceiling effects, and we did not find floor effects in the older adults (see   \u201cAssociation between age and memory performance\u201d). Together, this makes the task suitable for a life span study. We also assume that our task can be performed by participants with cognitive impairment and dementia. Sperling et al. ( ) showed that mild Alzheimer's disease patients were able to do a face\u2013name association task in which participants had to remember which name was associated with which face. In comparison, we had similar to even less instructions in our encoding task, and our retrieval task was easier, as we probed recognition memory, via old/new judgment, and not associative memory with previously seen lures. Further, for the recognition task, the questions and the answering options were shown on the screen for each trial. In conclusion, as long as participants are willing to be scanned for at least 10 min, the task should be applicable for people across all age ranges as well as people affected by neurodegenerative diseases. \n\n\n### Sensory-Specific Activity \n  \nMapping of perceptive auditory and visual brain activity ( : c1) showed quite consistent results with previous work with activity for auditory conditions in environmental and vocal selective brain regions (Belin et al.,  ; Pernet et al.,  ; Agus et al.,  ; Young et al.,  ) and with activity for visual conditions in face- and scene-selective brain regions, i.e., the fusiform face and the parahippocampal place area (Kanwisher et al.,  ; Epstein and Kanwisher,  ; Gazzaley et al.,  ; Collins and Olson,  ; Young et al.,  ). Response strength differences for vocal vs. environmental sound stimuli are also consistent with previous work (Belin et al.,  ,  ; Mostafa,  ). This imbalance could reflect either the properties of the auditory stimuli (spectral frequencies and temporal structure) or the organization of the auditory system. Although we found slightly stronger responses to scene stimuli, the contrast between face and scene stimuli was more balanced. These more similar levels of activity might also reflect either some property of the visual stimuli (i.e., similar discriminability) or the organization of the visual system. \n\nFrom a design perspective, the relative imbalance in evoked auditory activity is suboptimal. We mostly used stimuli from previous experiments to replicate known activity patterns by using the parallel mixed design (Belin et al.,  ; Sperling et al.,  ; Huijbers et al.,  ). The application of two different stimulus conditions for visual and auditory senses allowed a detailed examination of the sensory cortices, and it enabled us to use the task also in people with possible or known problems in parts of the sensory cortices. If, for example, a person has face recognition dysfunction, data from the visual scene stimuli can still be used. As we aim to make this task suitable for large-scale population-based studies, which mostly examine people of different ages and health states, it can give usable and comparable information on a wide range of sensory and memory functions. \n\n\n### Encoding Success Activity \n  \nThe ESA maps demonstrated that the auditory cortex and visual cortex showed sensory-specific ESA ( ). In contrast, the hippocampus and a subset of default network structures\u2014including the precuneus and angular gyrus\u2014showed ESA across both sensory domains. These results suggest that sensory-independent, or multimodal, brain regions form a core memory network (Johnson and Rugg,  ; Kim et al.,  ; Gilmore et al.,  ; Kim,  ). The precuneus showed negative ESA, consistent with previous findings on task-induced deactivation in the default network (Raichle et al.,  ; Daselaar et al.,  ; Huijbers et al.,  ; Krieger-Redwood et al.,  ). Especially negative ESA seems to be altered under the influence of early Alzheimer's disease pathology (Sperling et al.,  ; Ewers et al.,  ; Jagust,  ; Fu et al.,  ). Although hit-rates for visual stimuli and especially for scene stimuli were slightly higher and might have resulted in an unbalanced weighting (compare Discussion - Behavior section), the consistency with previous results demonstrates that small differences in the weighting did not influence results strongly. Therefore, our paradigm might be an efficient alternative for clinical and population studies that are interested in the functional responses of the memory system. Further, the encoding of both auditory and visual information allows investigators to disentangle factors that influence sensory-specific responses vs. alterations to the core memory system. One idea could be that age-related hearing loss is likely to affect auditory ESA, glaucoma in the retina is likely to affect visual ESA, and Alzheimer's pathology might target ESA in the core memory system. Our task is properly designed to disentangle these peripheral changes in sensory systems from alterations to the core memory network. \n\n\n### Sustained and Transient (De)Activations \n  \nThe activation maps (task > rest) between sustained and transient activities show largely an overlap between activated regions indicating that sustained and transient activations co-occur simultaneously in sensory cortices (Visscher et al.,  ; Petersen and Dubis,  ). However, deactivation maps (rest > task) show no overlap ( ). Hence, we did not find any brain region\u2014within or outside of the default network\u2014that simultaneously showed sustained and transient deactivations. The lack of overlap between sustained and transient deactivations is not easily explained by overfitting or competition within the mixed model, as we did find overlap between sustained and transient activities. This is also confirmed by our comparisons of parallel mixed model with the block-only and event-only models ( ). We also found that the majority of brain regions showed transient and not sustained deactivations. We interpret these findings in terms of task-intrusive and spontaneous thoughts (Weissman et al.,  ; Andrews-Hanna et al.,  ; Christoff et al.,  ). Task-induced deactivations are modulated by task demands (McKiernan et al.,  ) consistent with transient deactivation in response to the task. This would mean that the higher the task demands, the more deactivation will occur. The relative lack of brain regions that showed sustained deactivation suggests that a stable pattern of reduced activity is very rare, whereas event modeling gives more information about deactivation. This finding is also consistent with other mixed design studies that suggested mean activity is a relatively poor predictor of task performance (Garrett et al.,  ) because it disregards differences between stimuli and easily overestimates outlier. Finally, it is also possible that task-induced deactivations are modulated by, but not very tightly coupled to, stimulus onset. This would hinder the separation of sustained and transient deactivation. This last explanation is consistent with spontaneous thoughts (e.g., on the task instruction or other distractions coming from the situation in the scanner) that are partially restricted by the cognitive demands but not tightly coupled to stimulus onset. \n\n\n### Reliability \n  \nAs we did not have data to conduct a test\u2013retest reliability across the complete task, we estimated the task reliability using the second task session as the retest session. ICC analysis for the behavioral overall and sensory-specific data according to Koo and Li ( ) showed moderate-to-good reliability. Stimulus-specific ICCs were slightly lower. However, the two task sessions were not identical, as the order of blocks was different and new stimuli of the same conditions were presented. Therefore, we expect to have underestimated the actual ICC values, and we consider the obtained values to be quite plausible. The poor-to-moderate reliability values in the stimulus conditions confirmed our decision to exclude the separate stimulus conditions from ESA analyses. Overall, the moderate-to-good behavioral reliability permits the application of this task as an fMRI paradigm. \n\nVoxel-wise ICC analysis for fMRI data smoothed on group-level shows in general lower ICC values than the behavioral data. These values are similar to those of other studies that reported low or very heterogeneous ICC values for fMRI tasks (Bennett and Miller,  ; Barch et al.,  ; Brandt et al.,  ; Elliott et al.,  ). fMRI reliability is influenced by many factors, including scanner noise, physiological noise, cognitive factors and processes, sample size, sample characteristics, and task characteristics (Bennett and Miller,  ; Noble et al.,  ). We observed in most contrasts high ICC values in regions showing high activity (especially visual and, more specifically, in scene-related areas). This is not completely unexpected, as high fMRI activity can reduce the influence of errors, which results in a decreased within-participant variation, which then leads to an increase in ICC values (Bennett and Miller,  ; Brandt et al.,  ). However, we observed also in some highly activated regions a fairly low ICC (e.g., hippocampus, precuneus, or superior temporal gyrus). This could be a property of the regions showing a greater variability in the hemodynamic response. In this case, low ICC represents a low congruence between the two halves of activity of the task within participants, although activation was commonly observed over the complete task. Still, we consider our reliability estimates as quite realistic and conclude that even with the parallel presentation, the reliability in comparison with other fMRI studies is not reduced. \n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nParallel mixed block/event-related fMRI designs measure transient and sustained information within a single, time-efficient paradigm that includes a large number of stimuli. However, this makes mixed designs very complex, and regressors are always affected by both events and blocks. Especially, events are always modeled on a changing baseline. This can make it difficult to interpret the comparison between transient and sustained effects. \n\nOur study was sufficiently powered to calculate sensory-specific and overall ESA. However, we were not able to calculate stimulus-specific ESA within our sample. In the current study, we only included behavioral results from a small sample of older participants. Although their memory performance was slightly worse than that of participants in our younger sample, the hit-rates were close to 50%. Therefore, we would expect this task to be also applicable in older populations as well. \n\nFinally, we would like to mention that we were able to estimate low-to-moderate reliability using a split-half reliability. These estimates are comparable with those of other fMRI tasks, but reliability should be kept in mind especially when analyzing smaller sample sizes (Turner et al.,  ; Bossier et al.,  ; Noble et al.,  ). \n\n\n## Conclusions and Outlook \n  \nThe presented parallel mixed design task paradigm enables efficient mapping of a versatile number of contrasts in limited time, making it attractive to acquire task-evoked fMRI in an epidemiological context for large-scale studies. The ability to map sensory activity as well as sensory-specific and unspecific ESA, and the ability to separate sustained and transient activities, can provide new insights into the dynamics of fMRI across the life span (Jimura and Braver,  ; Petersen and Dubis,  ). Currently, it remains unclear how multiple modifiable factors like lifestyle, education, or blood pressure, together with non-modifiable factors, like APOE status or gender, determine the brain's functional responses over age and to pathology. Only large-scale population studies that possess sufficient power to dissociate these factors can provide answers to these questions. \n\nBesides these relevant questions, we would like to encourage future studies using the task to evaluate between-scanner reliability and to explore intra-individual variability in more depth. As the task is easily applicable, it does not require special scanning parameters and shows quite strong activation in the relevant brain regions relating to the main functions, we would not assume a huge loss of information if the data were collected with different scanners. As mentioned, the task requires only 10 min of fMRI scanning time. However, for generating ESA contrasts, an additional 10 to 19 min of (post-scan) recognition task needs to be performed. For many large-scale population studies, the limiting factor is the fMRI scanning time. The additional recognition task can be performed during other structural scans, which makes it user-friendly and cost-efficient. Previously, we demonstrated that the scan quality was not affected, or even benefitted, from performing a task inside the MRI (Huijbers et al.,  ). In case no other scans are needed, it is also possible to perform the recognition task outside the scanner, as long as the delay is constant for all participants. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets presented in this article are not readily available because of data protection regulations.

The present study sought to address how the reward network in the brain\u2014including the striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex\u2014is involved when individuals engage in the same task with a focus on approach or avoidance goals. Participants reported stronger positive emotions when they focused on approach goals, but stronger anxiety and disappointment when they focused on avoidance goals. The fMRI analyses revealed that the reward network in the brain showed similar levels of activity to cues predictive of approach and avoidance goals. In contrast, the two goal states were associated with different patterns of activity in the visual cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum during success and failure outcomes. Representation similarity analysis further revealed shared and different representations within the striatum and vmPFC between the approach and avoidance goal states, suggesting both the similarity and uniqueness of the mechanisms behind the two goal states. In addition, the distinct patterns of activation in the striatum were associated with distinct subjective experiences participants reported between the approach and the avoidance conditions. These results suggest the importance of examining the pattern of striatal activity in understanding the mechanisms behind different motivational states in humans. \n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.3758/s13415-024-01154-3. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nDecades of research on human motivation addressed the reasons behind inter- and intra- individual differences in the intensity and frequency of various behaviors (Braver et al.,  ). These studies pointed out that even if two individuals work on the same task with the intent to produce the same outcome, their emotional experiences, task engagement and behavior (which we shall call \u201cmotivational states\u201d) can be different depending on how they perceive the characteristics of the task (Ryan et al.,  ). The literature also identified various factors that affect people\u2019s motivational states (Kruglanski,  ; Murayama,  ; Reeve,  ). One of the most investigated and robustly observed factors is the difference of approach versus avoidance goals (Carver et al.,  ; Elliot,  ). Approach goals are defined as goals to obtain desirable outcomes (\u201cMy goal is to gain X\u201d), whereas avoidance goals are defined as goals to avoid the loss of desirable outcomes (\u201cMy goal is to avoid losing X\u201d). \n\nIn public communication as well as psychological research on human motivation, the salience of approach and avoidance goals often is manipulated by changing the frame of messages or instructions\u2014whether they focus on the benefits of adopting certain behaviors (  an approach frame  ; e.g., \u201cRegular exercise helps you control your weight and blood pressure\u201d) or the costs of not adopting certain behaviors (  an avoidance frame  ; e.g., \u201cWithout regular exercise, you are more likely to become obese and suffer from high blood pressure\u201d; Bertolotti & Catellani,  ). Using such methods, previous laboratory studies repeatedly observed that even if individuals face the same task, their subjective experiences and strategies are different depending on whether their goal is framed as approach or avoidance. In general, approach goals increase task enjoyment and intrinsic motivation, whereas avoidance goals increase anxiety and other negative emotions (Elliot & Harackiewicz,  ; Gee et al.,  ; Higgins et al.,  ). Similar results were observed in field studies by using questionnaires to assess individual differences in the strength of approach versus avoidance goals (for a meta-analysis, see Van Yperen et al.,  ). \n\nHow are these different motivational states represented in the brain? Previous neuroscience research often posited that the reward network in the brain, including the striatum, the substantia nigra, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), is critical for intrinsic motivation (Di Domenico & Ryan,  ; Lee & Reeve,  ; Murayama et al.,  ; Reeve & Lee,  )\u2014the motivation for the pleasure of the task itself (Deci & Ryan,  ). Given that approach goals typically increase positive emotional states (including intrinsic motivation), these studies thus suggest that the reward network shows greater activity when individuals pursue approach goals than avoidance goals. A similar prediction has been suggested by a personality theory based on the behavioral approach system (BAS) and the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) (Gray,  ,  ). The BIS/BAS are closely related to approach/avoidance goals; those who have higher BAS scores are more sensitive to gains and rewards and therefore have higher approach goals, whereas those who have higher BIS scores are more sensitive to losses and punishments and therefore have higher avoidance goals (Carver & White,  ). According to Gray, the reward network plays key role in BAS than BIS. In line with his notion, past studies found that those with higher BAS (but not BIS) showed greater activation of the striatum towards monetary rewards (Carter et al.,  ; Costumero et al.,  ; Hahn et al.,  ; Simon et al.,  ) or food rewards (Beaver et al.,  ). Recent research further revealed that stronger BAS scores (but not BIS) were associated with stronger functional connectivity within the reward network (Adri\u00e1n-Ventura et al.,  ). \n\nHowever, other research suggested that the reward network reflects more general motivational engagement independent from positively valenced subjective feelings (Carter et al.,  ; Reeve & Lee,  ; Sakaki et al.,  ). In fact, a recent meta-analysis revealed that the striatum, a key region in the reward network, is activated not only when individuals expect monetary rewards but also when they expect monetary losses (Oldham et al.,  ; White et al.,  ). These notions thus suggest that the reward network may show similar levels of activity across approach and avoidance goals. This prediction is supported by previous neuroimaging studies that used an experimental manipulation on approach versus avoidance goals. For example, Schlund et al. ( ) used a response learning task, where participants earned money when they made a correct response (the approach frame) and lost money when they made incorrect response (the avoidance frame). They found that the reward network showed similar levels of activities to cues irrespective of the goal frame. Belayachi et al. ( ) also revealed that the frontoparietal areas showed similar levels of activities when participants completed a working memory task under approach and avoidance goals. While this study is not necessarily about the reward network, their results suggest that the two goals are represented similarly in the brain. \n\nIn addition, other studies showed more complex pictures that were not consistent either of the aforementioned views. For example, Scult et al. ( ) examined the effects of individual differences in prevention vs. promotion focus (a concept closely related to avoidance vs. approach goals) on brain activities during a monetary reward task (i.e., Monetary Incentive Delay task). They found that higher promotion focus was associated with   smaller   activity in the ventral striatum to reward than loss cues. Other studies suggest that the approach versus avoidance goals are associated with the striatum in different hemispheres (Aberg et al.,  ; Eddington et al.,  ; Spielberg et al.,  ,  ). Thus, it is still inconclusive with regards to the role of the reward network in the approach versus avoidance goals. \n\nOne challenge for these past studies is that most of them used monetary rewards as part of the tasks of approach (i.e., to earn money) and avoidance (i.e., not to lose money) manipulations. Given that the reward network is activated by the presence of monetary rewards (Adcock et al.,  ) as well as the pleasure of tasks (Murayama et al.,  ), it is not clear from these studies whether the observed activity of the reward network is due to gains/loss of monetary rewards versus changes in intrinsic motivation (inherent pleasure of tasks). In fact, Sakaki et al. ( ) showed that when participants were engaged in a game-like, intrinsically enjoyable task, the activation pattern in the reward network was different, depending on whether participants worked on the task for monetary incentives or just for the enjoyment of the task itself. This is because when people are incentivized for monetary rewards, their motivation to gain rewards and to enjoy the task often would be in conflict, making the interpretation difficult. In addition, previous neuroimaging studies\u00a0on approach/avoidance goals do not include measures on subjective motivational states during tasks (Belayachi et al.,  ; Oldham et al.,  ; Schlund et al.,  ; Scult et al.,  ; White et al.,  ). Therefore, it has been unclear how the reward network in the brain is similarly or differently involved in positive and negative subjective motivational states induced by approach versus avoidance goals. \n\nIn the present study, we conducted a neuroimaging experiment to examine whether and how the reward network in the brain is involved in approach versus avoidance goals by using a game-like, intrinsically motivating task. Participants completed a stopwatch task (a task that was proven to be intrinsically engaging for adults; Murayama et al.,  ,  ; Sakaki et al.,  ) while being scanned in an MRI scanner. They were instructed that they could win or lose points during the stopwatch task depending on their performance, and their overall goal was to earn the total point of zero or larger than zero at the end of the experiments. They were\u00a0also told that the points they would earn would have nothing to do with their monetary rewards. The goal frame was manipulated\u2014such that participants completed the task under an approach goal frame in some blocks but under an avoidance goal frame in other blocks. In the approach blocks, participants gained points by succeeding in the task (i.e., approach goal framing); in the avoidance blocks, participants lost points by failing the task (i.e., avoidance goal framing). Note that both approach and avoidance blocks were functionally equivalent to achieve the overall goal. For example, even if participants fail all the trials in the approach condition, if they succeed in all the trials in the avoidance condition, the total points at the end of the experiment would be zero, thus achieving the overall goal. Similarly, participants should be able to achieve the overall goal by succeeding in all the trials in the approach condition\u2014in this case, even if participants fail all the trials in the avoidance condition, the total points at the end of the experiment would be zero. Thus, both the approach and avoidance blocks had the equal \u201cimportance\u201d in terms of achieving the overall goal of the task. \n\nWe assessed participants\u2019 subjective motivational states after each block (in the scanner) as well as at end of the study session. Building on previous findings (Elliot & Harackiewicz,  ), we expected that the two types of blocks would cause different motivational states in participants, with the approach blocks producing positive intrinsic motivational states (e.g., more enjoyment) while the avoidance blocks arousing negative motivational states (e.g., more anxiety). We also expected that participants would develop implicit associations between these different motivational states and tasks over time (Greenwald et al.,  ). \n\nAs brain regions relevant to different motivational states between the two goal frames, we focused on the reward network in the brain; including the striatum, the substantia nigra, VTA, and vmPFC. These brain regions have been robustly activated by the task cue as well as success outcomes in previous studies with the same task even without any extrinsic incentives (Murayama et al.,  ,  ; Sakaki et al.,  ; Takeda et al.,  ). Activation in the reward network during the stopwatch task was interpreted as the manifestation of intrinsic enjoyment for the task (Murayama et al.,  ). Therefore, they were a natural choice for our regions-of-interest (ROIs). \n\nIn our functional MRI analyses, we examined brain activity to a cue which indicated the start of the task (i.e., when participants anticipated an upcoming task) and brain activity towards outcomes (i.e., when participants found out whether they were successful). These two phases correspond to \u201cexpected\u201d versus \u201cactual experience of\u201d reward value respectively (Schultz,  ). More specifically, during the cue phase (Fig.  ), participants were informed of the goal frame (i.e., approach or avoidance) of an upcoming trial as well as how many points they would subsequently win if they succeeded in the approach condition or how many points they would lose if they failed in the avoidance condition. Building on the previous studies that approach goals make people focus on expected positive outcomes (Elliot & Harackiewicz,  ), we expected that participants would anticipate more pleasant emotions in the approach condition than in the avoidance condition. If the reward-network activation reflects positive motivational states (e.g., intrinsic motivation), these brain regions should show enhanced activity to the task cue in the approach condition but not to the task cue in the avoidance condition.   \nTask in the approach, avoidance, and control conditions \n  \n\nDuring the outcome phase (Fig.  ), participants found out whether they were successful or not in each particular trial. Previous psychological research has suggested that success outcomes are perceived more positively under the\u00a0approach\u00a0goal frame than the\u00a0avoidance goal\u00a0frame (Idson et al.,  ). Thus, if the reward network activity reflects intrinsic enjoyment, these brain regions also would be activated more strongly by the success feedback than the failure feedback in the approach condition but not in the avoidance condition. In contrast, if the reward-network activation reflects general motivational saliency or engagement dissociated from positive or negative motivational states, the reward network should show a similar level of activation to the cue and the success outcome in the approach and avoidance condition. \n\nWe also analyzed whether the goal frames affect functional connectivity of the reward network and representations within the reward network. Even when the overall level of activity is similar across the two goal frames, the functional connectivity of the reward network may be different across the two goal states. Given the nucleus accumbens (NAc)\u2019s dense projections with various brain regions (Haber & Knutson,  ), we examined whether functional connectivity of the NAc is different depending on the goal states. Likewise, even when the overall level of activity is similar, the two goal states may be supported by different patterns of activation within the reward network. Previous research pointed out that a representational similarity analysis is effective to address this issue and to provide insights into whether different tasks are supported by shared or distinctive neural mechanisms (Freund et al.,  ; Levorsen et al.,  ; Peelen & Downing,  ). To this end, we also applied a representational similarity analysis and examined if the pattern of activity in the reward network is similar or different when participants expect the approach and avoidance goals. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty participants (  M   = 20.55, standard deviation [SD] = 1.43; 9 males and 11 females) took part in the study. Written consent from participants was obtained based on the protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of the Tamagawa University. \n\n\n### Design and behavioral procedure \n  \nThe overall design and procedure is depicted in Fig.  . Participants completed a game-like task (the stopwatch task; Murayama et al.,  ,  ; Sakaki et al.,  ) under approach and avoidance goal framing. For each trial, participants were presented with a stopwatch that automatically started; they were asked to presss a button to stop the stopwatch within 50 ms of the 5-s time point. If participants stopped the stopwatch within this time window, the trial was deemed a success. In contrast, if participants failed to stop the stopwatch within this time window, the trial was deemed as a failure. To experimentally manipulate the success/failure outcome (without being affected by participants\u2019 performance), participants were shown random numbers on the display of the stopwatch after 3 s; thus, they could not accurately calibrate the correct timing. In some blocks, participants completed the task with a focus on approach goals, where they earned points when they succeeded but did not lose any points when they failed. In other blocks, participants completed the same task with a focus on avoidance goals, where they lost points when they failed but did not earn points when they succeeded. \n\nEach block started with a short instruction indicating the type of the upcoming block (approach = \u201cWill win points if you succeed\u201d; avoidance = \u201cWill lose points if you fail\u201d). Participants needed to press a button within 5 s to indicate that they understood the nature of the upcoming block; when participants did not press a button within 5 s, they were told that they needed to respond quickly and shown the same instruction again. This block instruction was followed by a jittered ISI (between 3 to 7 s) and experimental trials. Each trial started with a cue for 2 s. The cue indicated one of the three different points (3, 1, and 0). In the approach blocks, participants were told that they would earn the presented amount of points when they were successful in the trial, but they would not lose any points if they failed in the trial. In the avoidance blocks, participants were told that they would lose the presented amount of points when they failed in the trial, but they would not earn any points when they were successful. The cue was followed by a jittered ISI (between 3 to 7 s), which was replaced by a stopwatch that automatically started. Participants needed to press a button to stop the stopwatch within the time frame described earlier. Once participants pressed the button, the stopwatch stopped and participants found out whether they were sucessful or not. The outcome was shown for 3.2 s, followed by a jittered ITI (3\u20137 s) and the next trial. When participants failed to press a button within 6 s after the stoptwatch started, they were told to press the button sooner and a new trial started. The three different point conditions were included to increase the unpredictability of the task and thereby encourage participants to pay attention to the cue of each trial. \n\nIn the remaining blocks, participants completed a watch-stop game (i.e., the control condition). Each trial in this control task started with a cue (Fig.  ). Participants then passively viewed a stopwatch that automatically started and stopped; they pressed a button after the stopwatch stopped. In this control condition, they did not earn/lose any points. When participants pressed the button too quickly in the watch-stop task (i.e., before the stopwatch stopped), they were instructed to press the button only after the stopwatch stopped and the new trial started. \n\nThe experiment included 117 trials in total. These 117 trials were divided into three runs, each of which included five to eight blocks. This resulted in the total of 19 blocks with different lengths (each block included three to nine trials). There were eight blocks for the approach condition (48 trials), eight blocks for the avoidance condition (48 trials), and three blocks for the control condition (21 trials). For both approach and avoidance blocks, we presented the three different points (3, 1, 0) evenly (i.e., 16 trials for each point) but pseudorandomly; this means that participants were not able to predict the amount of points in the next trial. A stopwatch was colored differently across three conditions (blue, green, or orange); the color assignment was counterbalanced across participants. \n\nThe amount of points participants earned accumulated across blocks and runs; the total points they earned were indicated by a progress bar shown throughout the task. Before the task, participants were instructed that their overall goal of the experiment was to earn the total of zero or larger than zero at the end of the fMRI session. Participants were always reminded of this goal by a small flag that was displayed next to the progress bar (Fig.  ). \n\nTo ensure that our results were not confounded with task performance itself (or individual differences in the progress toward the goal), unbeknownst to participants, success versus failure outcome was experimentally controlled. Participants\u2019 success or failure outcome was predetermined for every trial, and participants were presented with the predetermined outcome regardless of their actual performance. Because we occluded the stopwatch after 3 s, participants did not realize our manipulation (no participants indicated their doubt after the experiment). We prepared four different sequences of success-failure outcomes and randomly assigned one of them to each participant. In all sequences, we made sure that participants could not be confident until the last trial about whether they could achieve the overall goal; participants finished the task with a total of zero points for all sequences. \n\n\n### Behavioral measures \n  \nWe assessed participants\u2019 motivational states for approach-avoidance blocks in three ways. First, after each block, participants rated the level of enjoyment (\u201cI enjoyed the block\u201d) and anxiety that they felt during the block they had just completed (\u201cI was anxious during the block\u201d) both with a 5-point Likert scale (  not at all   \u2013   extremely  ) while in the scanner. The enjoyment and anxiety scores were averaged across all the blocks for each condition respectively and used as an index of on-task measures of motivational states. \n\nSecond, after they exit the scanner, participants filled out a retrospective self-report questionnaire about emotional/motivational states they experienced during the approach and avoidance blocks. The questionnaire included two items for each of the following aspects with a 7-point Likert scale (  not at all true   \u2013   very true  ): enjoyment (e.g., \u201cI enjoyed the approach/avoidance blocks\u201d), anxiety (e.g., \u201cI had anxiety during the approach/avoidance blocks\u201d), disappointment (e.g., \u201cI was disappointed when I had to work on the approach/avoidance blocks\u201d), engagement (e.g., \u201cI felt engaged for the approach/avoidance blocks\u201d), and excitement (e.g., \u201cI was excited with the approach/avoidance blocks\u201d). Ratings given to the two items were averaged for each condition for each participant and were used as a measure that reflects retrospective evaluations of motivational states. The questionnaire also included items on emotions participants felt after the success and failure outcomes in each condition. Specifically, participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they felt happiness and relief when they were successful in the approach trials and avoidance trials respectively. They also indicated the extent to which they felt disappointed and anxious when they were not successful in the approach trials and avoidance trials. For both types of questions, we used a 7-point Likert scale (1: \u201cnot at all true\u201d \u2013 7: \u201cvery true\u201d). The questions were asked for the points of 3, 1, and 0 separately and we averaged the scores for the 3 and 1 points as we focused on these trials in the fMRI data analysis (see below). \n\nFinally, to assess participants\u2019 implicit attitude toward the approach and avoidance blocks, we asked participants to complete an Implicit Association Test (ITA)\u00a0at the end of the experiment (Greenwald et al.,  ). Participants were presented with positive/negative words as well as two pictures of stopwatches, one being used in the approach block (\u201capproach stopwatch\u201d) and the other being used in the avoidance block (\u201cavoidance stopwatch\u201d). Across seven IAT blocks (for details see Greenwald et al.,  ), participants were asked to press one of the two buttons in response to each of the presented stimuli. In two blocks, positive words and the approach stopwatch were assigned to the same key, while negative words and the avoidance stopwatch were assigned to the other key. In the other two blocks, positive words and the avoidance stopwatch were assigned to the same key, whereas negative words and the approach stopwatch were assigned to the other key. If participants had developed a positive attitude toward a stopwatch used in the approach condition, they should be able to respond faster and more accurately when the approach stopwatch was assigned to the same key as positive words than negative words. Based on the response time and error rate data, we computed IAT scores as the index of participants\u2019 implicit attitudes (in this paper, higher scores mean that individuals developed more positive implicit attitudes toward the approach stopwatch than the avoidance stopwatch). There are different algorithms proposed to compute the IAT scores, but we report the one recommended by Greenwald et al. ( ), although the results were the same with other computation algorithms. \n\n\n### Behavioral analysis \n  \nParticipants\u2019 responses in the self-report questions after each block and at the end of the experiment were compared between the approach and the avoidance conditions. We also analyzed IAT. We applied the false discovery rate (FDR) correction to control the type-I error rate. \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nData were acquired by using a 3-Tesla Siemens Trio Tim MRI scanner. Functional scans were obtained during three runs in the main task with echo T2*-weighted echo-planar images (EPI; repetition time = 2500 ms; echo time = 25 ms; flip angle = 90\u00b0; slice thickness = 3 mm; the number of slices = 42; acquisition matrix = 64 \u00d7 64). In addition, for each participant, a whole-brain, high-resolution T1-weighted structural scan was acquired (repetition time = 2000 ms, echo time = 1.98, acquisition matrix = 256 x 256). For functional data, we discarded the first two images before data processing and statistical analysis. \n\n\n### FMRI preprocessing \n  \nData preprocessing was performed by using FMRIB's Software Library (FSL ver 6.0.5;  ), including skull stripping of structural images with BET, motion correction with MCFLIRT, smoothing with full-width half-maximum 5 mm, and high-pass temporal filtering (Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting, with sigma = 100 s). We next performed MELODIC Independent Component Analysis (ICA; Beckmann & Smith,  ); artifact components were then removed with FSL\u2019s fMRIB's ICA-based Xnoiseifier (FIX; Salimi-Khorshidi et al.,  ). Registration was performed with FLIRT; each functional image was registered to the participant\u2019s high-resolution brain-extracted structural image by using a 7 degree of freedom (dof) transformation, and each participant\u2019s high-resolution structural image was registered to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 2-mm brain using a 12 dof transformation. \n\n\n### FMRI analysis \n  \nImage analysis was performed using FSL FEAT (fMRI Expert Analysis Tool,  ). For each run for each participant, the BOLD responses were modeled with a general linear model (GLM) with the following effects: 1) trial cues separately modeled for each point (0, 1, or 3) for each goal orientation condition (approach or avoidance), 2) success feedback for each point for each goal orientation condition, 3) failure feedback for each point for each goal orientation condition, and 4) trial cues for the stop-watch condition. The model also included the block instruction for each condition, motion parameters, the rating phases, missed block instruction (where participants failed to respond) and missed trials (where participants pressed a button too quickly or too slowly) as regressors of no interest. \n\nTo address our research questions, we defined our contrasts of interest for cue phases as well as outcome phases. For all contrasts described below, we did not include approach/avoidance trials with 0 points to make the interpretation straightforward. Regarding the cue phases, we focused on the following contrasts: a) the approach cue > the avoidance cue; b) the avoidance cue > the approach cue; c) the approach cue > the control cue; and d) the avoidance cue > the control cue. Because we were also\u00a0interested in the responses to success and failure outcomes across the two goal conditions, we included the following contrasts for outcomes: a) the approach success > the approach failure; b) the approach failure > the approach success, c)\u00a0the avoidance success > the avoidance failure; d) the avoidance failure > the avoidance success;\u00a0e) the approach success > the avoidance success; f) the approach failure > the avoidance failure; g) the avoidance success > the approach success; and h) the avoidance failure > the approach failure. The outputs from the first-level analysis were merged across runs for each participant by using a fixed-effects analysis in FSL\u2019s FEAT. The outputs from these fixed-effects analyses were further entered into a random effects analysis using FSL\u2019s FEAT FLAME 1. Both in the region-of-interest (ROI) analysis and the whole brain analysis, we employed cluster-based corrections for multiple comparisons with Gaussian random field theory (  Z   = 3.1; cluster significance:   p   = .05 corrected). \n\n#### Region-of-interest (ROI) analysis \n  \nWe first conducted a small-volume correction analysis, focusing on the following regions implicated in reward processing: the striatum, the substantia nigra, VTA, and vmPFC. The substantia nigra and VTA masks were provided by Jessica Mollick, drawn based on Eapen et al. ( ). The bilateral striatum mask was based on the Harvard-Oxford Subcortical Probability Atlas with the probability of 20% for the NAc, the putamen, and the caudate. We   a priori   decided a relatively lenient threshold (i.e.,\u00a020 %) given that a larger ROI mask leads to a more stringent threshold for significance in our analysis. The vmPFC mask was obtained based on the meta-analysis from de la Vega et al. ( ). These masks were then combined and used as a mask for our small-volume correction analysis. To visualize the activity patterns across the conditions, we used FSL\u2019s featquery to extract beta values from significant voxels observed in the ROI analysis. \n\n\n#### Whole-brain analysis \n  \nWe also performed a whole-brain analysis to examine how the goal frames and the outcome affect brain activity in other parts of the brain. The same set of contrasts used in the ROI analyses were also used in the whole brain analysis. \n\n\n\n### Functional connectivity analysis \n  \nCondition-dependent changes in functional connectivity of the NAc were examined using the generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) approach (McLaren et al.,  ) using FSL. While the ROI and whole brain analysis described earlier focused on event-related analysis, our gPPI analysis focused on changes in functional connectivity across the approach versus avoidance blocks. Therefore, we did not model a cue for each trial and outcome for each trial as separate regressors. Instead, we included two block regressors (one for the approach block and the other for the avoidance block), a time series of a seed region, the interaction between the time series and the approach condition, and the interaction between the time series and the avoidance condition in FSL\u2019s FEAT. We also included the onset of the cue for the control block, missed block instructions (where participants failed to respond), and the rating phase as additional regressors. The connectivity map from each run was concatenated across three runs for each participant with a fixed-effects analysis in FSL\u2019s FEAT. The participant-level maps were then used in the random-effect analysis done by FSL\u2019s FEAT FLAME 1. The seed regions included voxels in the left and right (separately) NAc that showed significant effects during the ROI analysis. As in our ROI analysis, NAc was defined by the Harvard-Oxford Subcortical Probability Atlas with the probability of 20%. We used FSL\u2019s command-line utility \u201cfslmeants\u201d to extract time series of the seed regions from the functional data. As in the whole brain analysis described earlier, results were considered significant at Z\u2009>\u20093.1 and cluster-corrected   p  \u2009<\u2009.05. \n\n\n### Representational similarity analysis \n  \nWe also applied representational similarity analysis (RSA) (Freund et al.,  ) to examine whether the pattern of activity within the reward network is similar when participants expected the stop-watch task in the approach goal condition, the stop-watch task in the avoidance goal condition, and the control task. Pre-processing of functional imaging data was re-run without spatial smoothing and ICA denoising, and the functional data for each participant were not transformed to MNI space (Lee et al.,  ; Weaverdyck et al.,  ). We modeled a cue for each point (0/1/3) for each condition separately for each participant; success/failure outcomes, motion parameters, rating, and block cues were also\u00a0included as regressors of no interest. Using FSL FEAT, we obtained beta values for each voxel for each regressor, resulting in a voxel-wise pattern of beta values for each cue type. As in the other analyses, we focused on approach and avoidance trials with 1 or 3 points. We also focused on the striatum and vmPFC; these regions were defined as in the ROI analysis described above. Using PyMVPA ( ) (Hanke et al.,  ), we computed Pearson correlations across different runs, points and conditions based on the voxel-wise activation pattern. The correlation coefficients were transformed by Fischer\u2019s z-transformation before statistical analyses to compare them. \n\nTo examine whether the activation patterns were more similar for two conditions from the same goal frame than two conditions from different goal frames, we compared the similarity in the approach-approach pairs (i.e., similarity between the approach condition with 1 point and the approach condition with 3 points), avoidance-avoidance pairs (i.e., similarity between the avoidance condition with 1 point and the avoidance condition with 3 points), and approach-avoidance pairs (e.g., similarity between the approach condition and the avoidance condition). We also examined whether the pattern similarity was higher for two stop-watch conditions with different goal frames (i.e., approach-avoidance pairs) than the stopwatch-control pairs (i.e., the similarity between the approach condition and control condition or between the avoidance condition and control condition). \n\nAs an exploratory analysis, we next explored whether distinct representations in the striatum and vmPFC were associated with different subjective experiences across the approach and avoidance goal conditions. For each participant for each ROI (striatum and vmPFC), we computed a pattern similarity index by dividing the similarity in representations between the approach and avoidance pairs by the similarity between the two same goal pairs (i.e., approach-approach and avoidance-avoidance); higher values represent higher similarity in the voxel activation patterns between the approach and avoidance condition. For each self-report measure, we obtained a difference score between the two goal conditions for each participant (e.g., on-task enjoyment for the approach condition minus on-task enjoyment for the avoidance condition); we applied Principal Component Analysis\u00a0(PCA) to all the difference scores from self-reports and used the first component as an index for the general difference in subjective experiences between the two goal conditions (see Table   for loadings). Given the presence of potential outliers, we used Spearman\u2019s rank correlation and examined if this general difference in subjective experiences was significantly associated with the pattern similarity indices for the striatum and the vmPFC. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nIn this section, we adjusted   p  -values based on FDR. Participants overwhelmingly demonstrated positive emotions and stronger motivation for the approach blocks than for the avoidance blocks (Fig.  ). This was evident in the on-task rating, where participants reported stronger enjoyment (  M  apr = 3.52, SD = 0.61;   M  avd = 2.41, SD = 1.01),   t  (19) = 5.07,   p   < .01, dz = 1.13, and weaker anxiety after the approach than the avoidance blocks (  M  apr = 2.57, SD = 0.89;   M  avd = 3.52, SD = 1.00),   t  (19) = 4.45,   p   < .01, dz = \u22120.99. Likewise, in the post-scanning retrospective ratings, participants reported stronger enjoyment (  M  apr = 5.80, SD = 1.09;   M  avd = 2.65, SD = 1.69),   t  (19) = 7.36,   p   < .01, dz = 1.65, less anxiety (  M  apr = 3.33, SD = 1.52;   M  avd = 4.88, SD = 2.05),   t  (19) = \u22123.29,   p   < .01, dz = \u22120.74, less disappointment (  M  apr = 1.40, SD = 0.80;   M  avd = 4.85, SD = 2.03),   t  (19) = \u22126.44,   p   < .01, dz = \u22121.44, more engagement (  M  apr = 5.95, SD = 1.15;   M  avd = 4.90, SD = 1.72),   t  (19) = 2.59,   p   < .05, dz = 0.58, and more excitement (  M  apr = 4.88, SD = 1.69;   M  avd = 3.70, SD = 1.40),   t  (19) = 3.64,   p   < .01, dz = 0.81, to the cue for the approach condition than the avoidance condition.   \nBehavioral results for the approach (\u201cApr\u201d) and the avoidance (\u201cAvd\u201d) conditions \n  \n\nWhen asked about emotions towards success and failure feedback, participants reported stronger happiness towards success in the approach trials than the avoidance trials (  M  apr = 6.30, SD = 0.70;   M  avd = 5.82, SD = 1.09),   t  (19) = 2.37,   p   < .05, dz = 0.53. Participants also reported stronger disappointment (  M  apr = 4.10, SD = 1.85;   M  avd = 5.20, SD = 1.67),   t  (19) = 4.00,   p   < .01, dz = \u22120.89, and stronger anxiety (  M  apr = 3.85, SD = 1.76;   M  avd = 5.08, SD = 1.66),   t  (19) = 3.89,   p   < .01, dz = \u22120.87, toward failures in the avoidance trials than the approach trials. There was no significant difference in the feelings of relief between the two conditions (  M  apr = 6.12, SD = 1.02;   M  avd = 5.95, SD = 1.44),   t  (19) = 1.10, dz = 0.25. In addition, the IAT scores reveal that participants developed more positive attitude toward the approach blocks than the avoidance blocks (  M   = 95.03, SD = 113.79);   t  (19) = 3.73,   p   < .01, dz = 0.84. As shown in the effect size metric, most of the effects were relatively large (except for relief), indicating the large differences between the blocks in terms of subjective feelings. \n\n\n### ROI analysis \n  \n#### Activity to cue \n  \nRelative to the control cues (i.e., watch-stop cues), the cues for the approach and the avoidance conditions induced stronger activation in the bilateral striatum, including the caudate, nucleus accumbens (NAc) and putamen (Fig.  A-B; Table  ). We also found significant clusters around the brainstem, including the VTA and SN, which showed greater activity to the cues for the approach and the avoidance conditions relative to the cue for the control condition (Fig.  ; Table  ). There were no significant differences between the approach vs. avoidance conditions. These results suggest that, unlike the behavioral results, the levels of activations in the reward network were not significantly affected by the approach-avoidance goal manipulation.   \n(A) Striatum activity to cues predictive of the approach and avoidance goals respectively relative to the control condition. (B) Beta values extracted from the significant striatum cluster. Apr = approach, Avd = avoidance.

NS  \u00a0no significant results \n    \nThe ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) showed higher levels of activity to cues predictive of the approach and the avoidance goals relative to the control condition \n  \n\n\n#### Activity to outcome \n  \nDuring the outcome phase, we found greater activity in the bilateral NAc to success relative to failure outcomes (Fig.  A; Table  ), replicating previous findings (Murayama et al.,  ). When examining the approach and avoidance conditions separately, the significant NAc activity after success outcomes was observed only in the approach condition (Fig.  B; Table  ). In the approach condition, vmPFC also showed a significant activity to success than failure outcomes. In contrast, in the avoidance blocks, there were no significant differences between success versus failure outcomes (Table  ). However, we did not find a significant interaction between the goal type (approach vs. avoidance) and outcome (success vs. failure) in the ROI analysis (Table  ). Thus, there is no strong evidence that the effects of success versus outcomes were different in our ROIs between the two goal conditions (Fig.  ).   \nThe activity in the striatum and vmPFC to success than failure outcomes in the ROI analysis \n    \nSignificant cluster during success than failure outcome presentations in the ROI analysis \n  \nCorresponding brain region was identified by the Harvard Oxford Cortical/Subcortical atlas.   NS  \u00a0no significant results \n  \n\n\n\n### Functional connectivity analysis \n  \nWe next used the gPPI analysis to explore how the functional connectivity of the striatum is different between the approach and the avoidance conditions. The seeds were the left and right NAc that showed significant activity to the success outcomes than the failure outcomes in the approach condition. However, we did not find any significant differences in the functional connectivity with the right/left NAc across the conditions. \n\n\n### Representational similarity analysis \n  \nUsing RSA, we examined the similarity in the pattern of activity in voxels within the striatum and vmPFC across cues for the approach condition, the avoidance condition, and the control condition (Fig.  A). The activity pattern in the striatum and vmPFC was significantly correlated across all pairs (  ps   < .05 FDR corrected). However, as shown in Fig.  A, the similarity was higher for pairs that included two stop-watch tasks (irrespective of the goal frames) than for pairs that included a stop-watch task and a watch-stop/control task. In addition, cues for the stop-watch task showed higher similarity when they were paired with the other cue for the same goal frame than when they were paired with other cues for the different goal frame.   \nResults from the representational similarity analysis for the approach (\u201cApr\"), avoidance (\u201cAvd\u201d), and control conditions (\u201cWS\u201d). (  A  ) The averaged similarity matrix for the striatum and vmPFC across all cues. p1: point 1 trials, p3: point 3 trials. (  B  ) The pattern similarity was the highest for the same goal pairs (Apr-Apr: approach-approach pairs and Avd-Avd: avoidance-avoidance pairs), followed by pairs of stop-watch tasks with different goal frames (Apr-Avd; approach-avoidance pairs). The Apr-Avd pairs still had higher similarity than when they were paired with control tasks (WS-SW: watch-stop \u2013 stopwatch pairs) \n  \n\nIn fact, a 2 (region: striatum vs. vmPFC) x 4 (pair types: approach-approach, avoidance-avoidance, approach-avoidance, and approach/avoidance-control) ANOVA on the similarity measures resulted in a significant effect of pair types,   F  (3, 76) = 28.33,   p   < .001, \u03b7  = .35, without any other significant effects (  p  s > .20; Fig.  B). Follow-up analyses revealed that the activation pattern was more similar for the same goal-type pairs (approach-approach:   M   = .43, SD = .16;   M   = .43, SD = .17; avoidance-avoidance:   M   = .43, SD = .19;   M   = .49, SD = .23) than the approach-avoidance pairs (  M   = .26, SD = .16;   M   = .30, SD = .17),   ts  (19) = 3.62, 6.26, d = 0.92, 1.27,   ps   < .05 (Tukey). However, the approach-avoidance pairs still had higher similarity than the control-stopwatch pairs (  M   = .14, SD = .18;   M   = .13, SD = .19),   t  (19) = 3.72, d = 1.20,   p   < .01 (Tukey). These results suggest that while there are unique representations for the approach and avoidance goals in the striatum and vmPFC, the two goals also share patterns of activity that are significantly different from the control/watch-stop condition. An exploratory analysis further revealed that the striatum\u2019s pattern similarity index was significantly associated with distinct subjective experiences between the two goal conditions, Spearman\u2019s rho = \u2212.53,   p   = .017. This means that those who had more   dissimilar   representations in the striatum between the approach and avoidance goal conditions experienced more distinct subjective experiences across the two conditions (Fig.  ). The pattern similarity index of vmPFC was not significantly associated with subjective experiences (  p   = .67).   \nLower similarity in the striatum representations between the approach and avoidance condition was associated with higher differences in subjective experience between the two conditions \n  \n\n\n### Whole-brain analysis \n  \nOur analysis so far focused on the striatum, VTA/SN and vmPFC. To address whether the two goal states were differently associated with other brain regions, apart from the reward network in the brain, we also performed a whole brain analysis. \n\n#### Activity to cue \n  \nA whole-brain analysis on brain activity during the cue phase confirmed results from our ROI analyses that both the approach and avoidance cues induced greater activity in the striatum and the VTA/SN than the control cues (Fig.  ; Table  ). Both the approach and avoidance cues induced greater activity in the cingulate gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, the middle frontal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the occipital pole relative to the control cue. There were no significant differences between approach and avoidance cues. \n\n\n#### Activity to outcome \n  \nA whole-brain analysis during the outcome phases also confirmed the results from the ROI analysis that NAc and vmPFC showed greater activity to success than failure outcomes in the approach block (Table  ; Fig.  A). Beyond these regions, in the approach condition, success outcomes induced greater activity in the bilateral lateral occipital gyri, the bilateral precentral gyrus/the middle frontal gyrus as well as the cerebellum than did failure outcomes (Fig.  ). In contrast, we did not find any regions that showed greater activity to failure than success outcomes in the approach condition.\n   \nSignificant clusters and local maxima during the outcome phase in whole-brain analysis \n  \nCorresponding brain region was identified by the Harvard Oxford Cortical atlas, Harvard Oxford Subcortical atlas as well as the Talairach atlas.   NS   no significant results \n    \nWhole-brain results for the success and failure outcomes for each goal frame condition \n  \n\nIn the avoidance condition, the [success > failure] contrast did not reveal any brain regions that showed significant activity (Table  ). However, in the avoidance condition, failure outcomes, relative to success outcomes, evoked stronger activity in the bilateral lateral occipital gyrus, right precentral gyrus/middle frontal gyrus, the right hippocampus, and the right superior part of the brainstem around the superior colliculus (Fig.  B; Fig.  ). These different effects of success versus failure between the approach and avoidance conditions resulted in significant interactions in bilateral lateral occipital gyrus, bilateral precentral gyrus/middle frontal gyrus, bilateral hippocampus, the cerebellum as well as the bilateral brainstem including the superior colliculus (Fig.  C). Thus, while the reward network showed similar patterns between approach and avoidance goal conditions, the goal manipulation elicited the opposite pattern for other areas in the brain between success versus failure outcomes. \n\n\n\n\n## General discussion \n  \nDespite the functional equivalence of approach and avoidance blocks with regards to their relevance to the overall goal of the task (i.e., to obtain the zero point), participants\u2019 motivational states were markedly different between the two types of blocks. Specifically, the approach goal trials were perceived as more enjoyable, engaging, and exciting, whereas avoidance goal trials were perceived as more anxiety provoking and disappointing. Participants also reported stronger happiness toward success in the approach condition than in the avoidance condition. In contrast, they reported stronger anxiety and disappointment toward failures in the avoidance condition than in the approach condition. Thus, their subjective experiences were substantially different depending on the goal frame. \n\nNevertheless, the level of activation in the reward network was strikingly similar between the two conditions. For both approach and avoidance goal blocks, the striatum, VTA, and substantia nigra showed significantly higher levels of activation in response to the task cue relative to the control condition, without any significant differences between the approach versus avoidance conditions. Even though the striatum showed significant activity to success outcome only in the approach condition, we did not observe a statistically significant difference between approach and avoidance conditions. In addition, when we investigated the pattern of activity in the reward network using RSA, we found that the activity pattern for the approach condition had higher similarity with the avoidance condition\u2014relative to the watch-stop/control condition. \n\nPrevious studies observed increased activation in the reward network during a similar task and interpreted it as the manifestation of positive motivational states, so-called intrinsic motivation (Murayama et al.,  ). In contrast, we observed similar levels of activity in the reward network across the approach and avoidance conditions, even though participants had stronger intrinsic motivation in the former than the latter. Thus, our findings do not corroborate the claim that the reward network simply reflects intrinsic motivation (Di Domenico & Ryan,  ; Lee & Reeve,  ; Murayama et al.,  ). Rather, the results suggest that the reward network activation may reflect general motivational engagement, which is free from the valenced emotional feelings during the task. This interpretation is consistent with some of the past observations (Kim,  ). For example, Sakaki et al. ( ) showed participants 1) a task cue signaling a stopwatch that had a 50% success rate and 2) another cue signaling a stopwatch that was extremely easy for them to succeed (with a 100% success rate). Participants were\u00a0also given monetary reward after every success. They had more positive emotional feelings about the easy condition than the difficult condition, which made sense as the easy condition enabled them to earn more money. Nevertheless, the task cue with the difficult condition activated the ventral striatum/ventral pallidum more robustly than the task cue for the easy condition. These findings indicate that the striatal activation in response to the task cue does not simply reflect positively valenced feelings; instead, they may reflect motivational engagement (i.e., participants needed to work harder in the difficult condition with stronger engagement relative to the easy condition). Krebs et al. ( ) also conducted an fMRI study, which independently manipulated the reward and task difficulty, and suggested that the reward network (e.g., the midbrain, caudate nucleus) may be related to mental resource recruitment on top of the rewarding value. \n\nA recent, large-scaled study also\u00a0supports this notion (White et al.,  ); the authors analyzed individual differences in striatal activity during the monetary incentive delay task and found that the striatum was involved not only for reward but also for loss. In addition, they found that the level of the striatal activity was not associated with self-report measures on positive emotions. These results further suggest that the reward network plays an important role for reward as well as general task engagement. Their results are consistent with our findings that different subjective experiences do not necessarily correspond to different levels of activity in the striatum. \n\nOur study also suggests several key differences between the approach and avoidance goals. First, our RSA analyses not only revealed the similarity in the way the approach and avoidance goals are represented in the reward network but also highlighted that the two goal orientations are represented differently within the reward network. Specifically, we found that the pattern of activity within the striatum and vmPFC was more similar in the two stop-watch cues with the same goal orientation (i.e., approach-approach pairs or avoidance-avoidance pairs) than the two stop-watch cues from different goal orientations (i.e., approach-avoidance pairs). For example, the approach cue for the 1-point condition had higher similarity in the striatum and vmPFC activity pattern to the approach cue for the 3-point condition than the avoidance cue for the same 1-point condition. These results may indicate that the two goal states are supported by distinct mechanisms in the reward network (Levorsen et al.,  ; Peelen & Downing,  ). In addition, participants who showed more distinct activation patterns in the striatum across the approach and avoidance conditions reported more distinct subjective experiences between the two goal frame conditions. In contrast, the pattern of activity in the vmPFC was not significantly associated with subjective experiences. These results suggest that even when the level of striatal activation is similar, a pattern of activity in the striatum may be important to distinguish and support positive and negative motivational states. \n\nSecond, we observed differences between the two conditions in our whole brain analysis during the outcome phase. Specifically, there were some brain areas that responded similarly to the successful outcomes in the approach condition versus the failure outcomes in the avoidance condition. The majority of these are visual or motor related areas, indicating that these outcomes (i.e., success in approach condition and failure in avoidance condition) may have been preferentially attended to by participants. The strong activity observed in the visual area makes sense, because these two outcomes resulted in the visible change of the points to participants; therefore, they should have been salient to participants. One interesting result concerns the hippocampus. The hippocampus showed increased activity to failures than success in the avoidance condition but not in the approach condition. Previous research also suggests that the hippocampus is critical in dealing with an approach-avoidance conflict (i.e., when individuals approach stimuli that they rather want to avoid), although the implicated area often was more anterior than the cluster we observed (Bach et al.,  ; Loh et al.,  ; O'Neil et al.,  ). Relatedly, neurobiological theories of anxiety indicate that the hippocampus plays a critical role in anxiety (Gray & McNaughton,  ), an emotion that individuals often experience when they focus on avoidance goals. Future studies should closely examine how the hippocampus helps in learning from failures particularly under avoidance goals. \n\nIn contrast to the hippocampus, we did not see any significant differences between the approach and the avoidance conditions in the reward network during the outcome phase. Behaviorally, the success feedback induced stronger happiness after the approach condition than the avoidance condition. This is consistent with the notion that a success in the approach condition leads to stronger happiness and enjoyment relative to a success in the avoidance condition (Elliot & Pekrun,  ). Despite such differences in subjective experiences, the success feedback, relative to the failure feedback, evoked stronger activity in the striatum irrespective of the goal frames. These results are consistent with previous findings that the striatum was activated when an aversive event (e.g., pain) was not present and participants were relieved (Leknes et al.,  ; Navratilova et al.,  ). Thus, the lack of an aversive event (i.e., a loss of points) in the event of success in the avoidance condition can be still associated with striatum activity. \n\nAnother important observation is that the two goal frame conditions were not significantly different in other brain regions relevant to emotions (such as the amygdala and the insula). This is in contrast to previous studies on prevention and promotion focus; these studies revealed that individual differences in prevention versus promotion focus were associated with individual differences in amygdala activity to emotional stimuli, such as positive/negative concepts or positive/negative emotional images (Cunningham et al.,  ,  ). However, in these studies, participants were typically presented with unique stimuli in each trial. In contrast, in the present study, the stopwatch was similar across trials, which may have induced the habituation of the amygdala and prevented us from seeing any effects of goals on amygdala activity (Weierich et al.,  ). In fact, other studies without emotional stimuli did not observe the effects of individual differences in goal orientation on amygdala activity (Belayachi et al.,  ; Hahn et al.,  ). Thus, the effects of goal orientation on amygdala activity may be stronger in situations where individuals face emotionally salient and distinct stimuli. \n\nIt is important to note several limitations of the present study. First, our sample size was modest. Even though we observed reliable differences between the two goal conditions in behavioral measures, the relatively small sample size may have led to the lack of power to detect the effects of goal frames in the univariate fMRI analysis. Relatedly, due to the modest sample size, our study was not well powered to investigate the effects of individual differences. Thus, caution is required when interpreting our results on individual differences in the pattern similarity index; future research needs to examine whether the results will be replicated in an independent and larger sample. In addition, previous research revealed that individual differences in their goal orientation play an important role in modulating the effects of situational goal frame\u00a0manipulations (Cunningham et al.,  ; Touryan et al.,  ). Further research is required to understand the interaction between the approach versus avoidance goal manipulation and individual differences in the salience of these two goals. \n\nSecond, our goal frame manipulation was different from those used in previous behavioral or neuroimaging studies. In previous neuroimaging studies, the goal frame often was manipulated by using monetary rewards (as described in the Introduction) (Schlund et al.,  ); this means that achieving a goal has a clear personal benefit for participants (i.e., they would be able to earn more money). Previous studies also did not always control for performance (Elliot & Harackiewicz,  ; Gee et al.,  ; Schlund et al.,  ). The manipulations we used were different from them; there were no extrinsic rewards associated with the goal, and performance was experimentally controlled so that there was no difference in performance across the two goal frame conditions. Nevertheless, we replicated previously observed effects of goal frames, such as increased enjoyment under the approach goal, increased anxiety under the avoidance goal, and increased engagement under the approach goal (Elliot & Harackiewicz,  ; Gee et al.,  ; Higgins et al.,  ). This suggests that our manipulation was successful to alter the saliency of\u00a0participants\u2019 goals. At the same time, given that most behavioral measures were obtained after the scanning session, it is possible that their responses were biased by memory errors. Future research may want to assess subjective experiences without relying too much on post-hoc self-reports. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe present study demonstrates both the similarity and the uniqueness in the role of the reward network in approach versus avoidance goals. As observed in previous psychological studies, we observed that the same task is perceived differently depending on whether it is framed as approach or avoidance goals. Despite the marked difference in subjective motivational states, the reward network showed similar levels of activity across the two conditions; such that the striatum, VTA, and SN showed higher levels of activity to task cues in the approach goal condition as well as the avoidance goal condition relative to the control cue. The RSA also revealed that the approach condition and the avoidance condition were represented similarly in the striatum and vmPFC relative to the control condition. However, RSA also indicates differences between the two goal frames, suggesting that the two goal frames were represented differently within the striatum and vmPFC. These results suggest that the reward network is involved both in general motivational engagement and in the emotional valence of subjective motivational experiences. \n\n\n\n### Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 11078806, "text_md5": "0f118f255a4a4e667aef57cb71b36eaf", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 170], "journal": [171, 197], "publication_year": [199, 203], "title": [214, 341], "keywords": [355, 470], "abstract": [483, 2173], "body": [2182, 62445]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 38291308, "doi": "10.3758/s13415-024-01154-3", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11078806", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=11078806"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11078806\">11078806</a>", "list_title": "PMC11078806  Motivated with joy or anxiety: Does approach-avoidance goal framing elicit differential reward-network activation in the brain?"}

Recent brain imaging studies suggest abnormal brain activity underlying psychopathic behavior. No reliable pattern of altered neural activity has been disclosed so far. This study sought to identify consistent changes of brain activity in psychopaths and to investigate whether these could explain known psychopathology. First, we used activation likelihood estimation (p < 0.05, corrected) to meta-analyze brain activation changes associated with psychopathy across 28 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies reporting 753 foci from 155 experiments. Second, we characterized the ensuing regions functionally by employing meta-data of a large-scale neuroimaging database (p < 0.05, corrected). Psychopathy was consistently associated with decreased brain activity in the right laterobasal amygdala, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and bilaterally in the lateral prefrontal cortex. A robust increase of activity was observed in the fronto-insular cortex on both hemispheres. Data-driven functional characterization revealed associations with semantic language processing (left lateral prefrontal and fronto-insular cortex), action execution and pain processing (right lateral prefrontal and left fronto-insular), social cognition (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), and emotional as well as cognitive reward processing (right amygdala and fronto-insular cortex). Aberrant brain activity related to psychopathy is located in prefrontal, insular, and limbic regions. Physiological mental functions fulfilled by these brain regions correspond to disturbed behavioral patterns pathognomonic for psychopathy. Hence, aberrant brain activity may not just be an epiphenomenon of psychopathy but directly related to the psychopathology of this disorder. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \n Psychopathy   is a term derived from the Ancient Greek words \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae (soul) and \u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (suffering). The term has undergone several shifts of meaning in the history of psychiatry. While it was originally associated with the notion of organic inferiority , Kurt Schneider (1923) used it as an umbrella term for what we would call personality disorders nowadays . Among the variants of psychopathy (i.e., personality disorder) that Kurt Schneider described, the type of the   affectionless psychopath   came closest to our current use of the term. Less than two decades after Schneider, American psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley (1941) published his most influential monograph,   The Mask of Sanity  . In this book, Cleckley not only provided rich case descriptions but also a clinical profile of criteria that psychopaths would fulfill. Among these criteria were pathological egocentrism, the inability to love others, deceitfulness, and a lack of remorse or shame. Both Kurt Schneider (1923) and Hervey Cleckley (1941) emphasized the importance of callousness and the lack of emotional resonance as pathognomonic symptoms of the disorder.  Others also emphasized that social negativism is the most elementary datum of psychopathy . \n\nIn contrast to antisocial (or dissocial) personality disorder according to the American Psychiatric Association (2013) and the World Health Organization (1992) , the distinguishing hallmarks of psychopathy are a lack of anxiety or fear and a bold interpersonal style . While most psychopaths can meet the criteria for antisocial personality disorder, most individuals with antisocial personality disorder do not meet the criteria for psychopathy. Psychopathy is of high public concern due to its association with violence and offense recidivism.  Although psychopathy is considered a relatively rare phenomenon (with the prevalence estimated at about 1% of the general population ), psychopaths commit a disproportionate amount of crime , especially of violent offenses. The odds of violent re-offending are more than twice as high in psychopathic offenders as in non-psychopathic offenders. \n\nIn the recent past, neuroimaging studies have sought to identify brain abnormalities underlying psychopathy.  However, a considerable variability in results across studies has been pointed out, which may be due to differences in design (e.g., active vs. passive tasks), analysis (e.g., group comparisons vs. correlational analyses), and sample sizes.  Furthermore, differences in measurement of psychopathy (e.g., clinical vs. self-report; different cutoff thresholds) and sample demographics (e.g., gender, ethnicity, incarcerated vs. non-incarcerated) might introduce inhomogeneity. Given this heterogeneity of neuroimaging results, it has been deemed \u201cpremature to interpret certain findings as support for any particular theoretical viewpoint\u201d regarding affected neural circuits.  Put differently, it still remains an open question whether psychopathy is based on a robust organic substrate or merely reflects a variant of bad character traits. A summary of the extant imaging data is urgently needed to identify potential neural correlates of psychopathy. For an objective assessment of inter-study concordance, automated meta-analyses that quantify the level of concordance and allow identification of brain regions associated with significant convergence in a testable manner are preferable. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE), firstly described by Turkeltaub et al. (2002) and subsequently refined , meets these demands and represents the most widely accepted approach for such quantitative integration of neuroimaging findings. Here, we used ALE to locate abnormal brain activity associated with psychopathy. \n\nThe mere localization of aberrant brain activity leaves unclear, however, whether functional brain alterations can account for pertinent psychopathology in psychopaths. To remove this ambiguity, we furthermore statistically assessed the physiological mental functions of the regions where we found convergence of altered brain activity associated with psychopathy. That is, we did not refer to previous assumptions in the literature on the putative psychological functions of the respective approximate brain regions. We rather statistically linked psychological functions to the exact clusters revealed by our meta-analysis by employing meta-data of a large-scale neuroimaging database. This combination of functional localization and characterization allows for observer-independent linking of pathophysiology to psychopathology. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Coordinate-based meta-analysis \n  \n#### Data selection \n  \nA principled procedure to identify the relevant experimental studies was used. First, we selected studies through a standard search in the PubMed ( ) and ISI Web of Science ( ) databases using the terms \u2018psychopathy\u2019 or \u2018psychopathic\u2019 in combination with \u2018fMRI\u2019, \u2018functional MRI\u2019, \u2018functional magnetic resonance\u2019, \u2018PET\u2019, \u2018positron emission\u2019, \u2018ASL\u2019, \u2018arterial spin labeling\u2019, \u2018MEG\u2019, \u2018magnetoencephalography\u2019, \u2018neuroimaging\u2019, or \u2018imaging\u2019. Second, further studies were found by means of the \u2018related articles\u2019 function of the PubMed database and by tracing the references from the identified papers and review articles. Task-based neuroimaging experiments were considered relevant when they reported either (1) direct group comparisons between psychopathic und non-psychopathic subjects or (2) correlations of brain activity with an established measure of psychopathy (e.g., the revised Psychopathy Checklist [PCL-R] ). Both approaches are valid to operationalize alterations in brain activity associated with psychopathy because psychopathy can be conceptualized categorically as well as dimensionally . Importantly, both approaches included in our meta-analysis related psychopathy to established measures of this disorder. Additionally, only experiments reporting results of whole-brain group analyses with coordinates referring to a standard reference space (Talairach-Tournoux or Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI]) were included. Results of region-of-interest analyses and studies not reporting stereotaxic coordinates were excluded. \n\nOn the basis of these search criteria, 28 papers were found to be eligible for inclusion into the meta-analyses ( ). Only functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) but no positron emission tomography (PET), arterial spin labeling (ASL) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies fulfilled our search criteria. Together, these papers reported 753 foci obtained from 155 experiments (with \u201cexperiment\u201d referring to an individual contrast reported in this paper; cf.,  ). The count of these foci was composed of 150 activations from 38 direct group comparisons (psychopaths > non-psychopaths) and 95 foci of positive correlations between brain activity and psychopathy scales from 43 analyses as well as 234 deactivations from 37 direct group comparisons (psychopaths < non-psychopaths) and 274 foci of negative correlations between brain activity and psychopathy scales from 37 analyses. Differences in coordinate spaces (Talairach vs. MNI space) were accounted for by transforming coordinates reported in Talairach space into MNI coordinates using a linear transformation . \n\nFirst, convergence of all reported foci was analyzed for the main effect of aberrant brain activity in psychopaths (155 experiments, 753 foci). Furthermore, we assessed convergence of reported activation foci indicating increased brain activity in psychopaths by pooling direct group comparisons (psychopaths > non-psychopaths) and positive correlational analyses (81 experiments, 245 foci). In an analogous manner (i.e., by pooling group comparisons and correlational analyses), we tested for convergence of reported deactivation foci (74 experiments, 508 foci). The denoted sample sizes, i.e., numbers of experiments, have been shown to be sufficient to achieve robust meta-analytic estimates . \n\n\n#### Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) \n  \nAll statistical analyses were carried out using the revised ALE algorithm for coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging results . This algorithm aims to identify areas with a convergence of reported coordinates across experiments that is higher than expected from a random spatial association. Reported foci are treated as centers of 3D Gaussian probability distributions capturing the spatial uncertainty associated with each focus.  Here, the between-subject variance is weighted by the number of participants per study, since larger sample sizes should provide more reliable approximations of the \u201ctrue\u201d activation effect and should therefore be modeled by more \u201cnarrow\u201d Gaussian distributions. \n\nSubsequently, probabilities of all foci reported of a given experiment were combined for each voxel, yielding a modeled activation (MA) map ( ).  Notably, foci were organized by subject group, which prevents multiple foci from a single experiment from cumulatively influencing MA values.  This approach hence prevents multiple experiments performed by one subject group from cumulatively influencing ALE values. It can thus be excluded that effects are amplified by non-orthogonal contrasts (i.e., from the same study) being submitted to the same analysis. Voxelwise ALE scores (union across these MA maps) then quantified the convergence across experiments at each location in the brain. To distinguish \u201ctrue\u201d from random convergence, ALE scores were compared to an empirical null distribution reflecting a random spatial association among all MA maps. The resulting random-effects inference focuses on the above-chance convergence across studies rather than the clustering within a particular study.  This null hypothesis was derived by computing the distribution that would be obtained when sampling a voxel at random from each of the MA maps and taking the union of these values in the same manner as for the (spatially contingent) voxels in the original analysis.  The p-value of a \u201ctrue\u201d ALE score was then given by the proportion of equal or higher values obtained under the null distribution. The resulting nonparametric p-values were then assessed using threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE ) to correct for multiple comparisons (p < 0.05) and transformed into z scores for display . \n\nFor anatomical labeling, we capitalized on cytoarchitectonic maps of the human brain provided by the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) Anatomy Toolbox . Clusters were thus assigned to the most probable histologically defined area at the respective location. This probabilistic histology-based anatomical labeling is reported in the results tables. References to details regarding cytoarchitecture are given in the table notes. \n\n\n\n### Functional characterization \n  \nFunctional characterization intends to link topographically defined brain regions with corresponding psychological processes by testing which kind of experiments are most likely to activate a given region. To functionally characterize regions exhibiting aberrant activity related to psychopathy (i.e., the regions revealed by our meta-analysis; cf.  ), we made use of the BrainMap database ( ) that currently contains \u2248 7,500 experiments in healthy subjects (experiments investigating age, gender, disease, or drug effects excluded). BrainMap meta-data provide information on behavioral domain and paradigm class of each neuroimaging experiment included in the database. Behavioral domains describe the mental processes isolated by the statistical contrasts  and comprise the main categories action, cognition, emotion, interoception, perception, as well as their subcategories. Paradigm classes specify the task employed in the corresponding neuroimaging studies (see   for the complete BrainMap taxonomy). To describe the functional roles of the candidate regions, we used a reverse inference approach, which tests the probability of a mental process being present, given knowledge that a particular brain region is activated.  More precisely, the functional profile of a region was determined by over-representation of mental processes (i.e., behavioral domains and paradigm classes) in the experiments activating the respective cluster relative to the entire BrainMap database using a binomial test.  The significance threshold was set to p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR). To draw a more differentiated picture and complement this view by providing additional information on weaker associations, we also report both forward inference (probability of observing activity in a brain region given knowledge of the psychological process) and reverse inference (probability of a psychological process being present given knowledge of activation in a particular brain region) at a more liberal threshold (p < 0.05, uncorrected) in the supplement. This approach provides an objective and quantitative attribution of mental functions to brain regions in contrast to commonly used qualitative and subjective interpretation of activation foci in neuroimaging. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Coordinate-based meta-analysis \n  \nAcross 155 experiments, convergence of aberrant brain activity in psychopathy was observed in the lateral prefrontal cortex on both hemispheres, in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, bilaterally in the fronto-insular cortex extending into the right claustrum, and in the laterobasal subdivision of the right amygdala ( ;  ). The follow-up analysis of   increased   neural activity associated with psychopathy indicated convergence in the left and right fronto-insular cortex extending into the right claustrum ( ). In contrast, convergence of   decreased   brain activity in psychopathy was located in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the left and right lateral prefrontal cortex, and the right laterobasal amygdala ( ). Taken together, the follow-up analyses were able to unambiguously classify each malfunctioning region as showing either increased or decreased activity. That is, our analyses did not identify any region that was not selectively hyper- or hypoactivated. Contribution analyses did not suggest a specific stimulus or task characteristic to critically drive the effects. It can thus not be inferred that certain kinds of design lead to differences in a particular region. \n\n\n### Functional characterization \n  \nTo obtain an objective description of the tasks recruiting regions that feature aberrant activity associated with psychopathy and thus provide a link to the psychopathology of psychopathy, we conducted a functional characterization of the regions that were found in our meta-analysis. Hereby, psychological terms were related to the respective region as registered in the BrainMap database, i.e., on basis of functional experiments in healthy subjects ( ;  ). \n\nThe right lateral prefrontal cortex was significantly associated with action execution and at the more liberal threshold also with pain perception. In contrast, the left lateral prefrontal cluster was significantly associated with phonological (and semantic) language processing. At the relaxed threshold, also the dorsomedial prefrontal region was related to semantic language processing but was most robustly linked to social cognition. A significant above-chance association with the emotional domain was found for the laterobasal amygdala cluster. Lowering the statistical threshold specified an association with reward processing within the emotional domain. In an analogous manner, the right fronto-insular cluster related to reward processing, however, within the cognitive domain. The functional profile of the left fronto-insular cluster, in contrast, resembled that of the left lateral prefrontal cortex with a focus on language/speech processing, including delayed matching-to-sample tasks, as well as in addition pain processing. \n\nTaken together, we found decreased activity in regions associated with action control, semantic language processing, pain processing, social cognition, and emotional reward. Increased activity was observed in regions involved in cognitive reward and also in semantic language and pain processing. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study sought to identify robust alterations of brain activity associated with psychopathy and to investigate whether these could explain known psychopathology. To this end, we combined meta-analyses of whole-brain neuroimaging studies of psychopathy with functional characterization of the obtained regions using meta-data of a large-scale neuroimaging database. Our meta-analysis revealed aberrant brain activity associated with psychopathy converging in frontal, insular, and limbic regions. Post-hoc analyses in combination with data-driven functional characterization indicated decreased activity in regions crucial for semantic language processing (left lateral prefrontal cortex), action execution and pain processing (right lateral prefrontal cortex), social cognition (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), and emotional reward processing (right amygdala). In contrast, increased activity was located in a region for cognitive reward processing (right fronto-insular cortex) and another region associated with semantic language and pain processing (left fronto-insular cortex). \n\nThe observation of altered activity in two regions that were associated with semantic language processing fits well with previous evidence from psychological experiments showing abnormal processing of semantic and affective verbal information including vocal affect recognition in psychopathy . In this context, dysfunctional affect-language interactions have been proposed in psychopaths (\u201cThey know the words, but not the music\u201d).  The concomitance of increased and decreased activity in two nearby regions involved in semantic verbal processing (left fronto-insular and lateral prefrontal cortex) might seem confusing   prima facie   but reflect an imbalance of closely related brain networks as recently observed in affective disorders . \n\nAberrant (i.e., decreased) activity converged in a cluster within the right lateral prefrontal cortex that turned out to be associated with action execution. This finding might represent the neural correlate of impaired action control in psychopathy . This interpretation is supported by electroencephalographic data suggesting that poor response inhibition associated with psychopathic traits is predicated on reduced frontal function . In addition, the improvement of weak response inhibition associated with psychopathic traits after non-invasive electrical stimulation of the right lateral prefrontal cortex seems to confirm the supposed association . At a liberal threshold, this cluster as well as the cluster in the left fronto-insular cortex were also related to pain processing according to our functional characterization. Although caution is warranted, this result matches evidence suggesting psychopathy is linked to altered perception and tolerance as well as empathy of pain . \n\nThe dorsomedial prefrontal cortical region, where we found decreased activity, was significantly associated with social cognition, which includes empathy, morality, and theory of mind. A previous meta-analysis of the neural correlates of moral cognition in healthy subjects showed that the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex is consistently involved in all these three subdomains.  Moreover, our meta-analytic finding likely constitutes the neural basis of sociopathy or being affectionless (in Kurt Schneider\u2019s sense) as the core trait of psychopathy implying lack of empathy and remorse. The dysfunction of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex may result from or in altered functional connectivity of this region, which has been reported elsewhere and is most likely based on its reduction in gray matter . \n\nFinally, our analyses demonstrated consistently decreased activity in a laterobasal region of the amygdala that related to emotional reward processing, but increased activity in a brain region associated with cognitive reward processing, namely the right fronto-insular cortex. This down-regulation of affective in favor of cognitive brain regions may underlie pathognomonic shallow affect in psychopathy. Consistent with this notion, it has been noted that callous-unemotional traits are behavioral sequelae of deficient amygdala responsiveness . Also here, the imbalance of affective vs. cognitive regions might rest upon aberrant functional connectivity in the context of gray matter reduction in psychopathy . \n\nSo far, no consistent pattern of structural brain alterations in psychopathy has been identified. However, evidence of gray matter thinning in lateral and medial prefrontal as well as in temporal cortical regions suggests a link between structural perturbations and aberrant activity in these regions that we identified in this meta-analysis.  These morphological changes may be associated with certain psychopathic traits and in particular be evident in so-called unsuccessful psychopaths , i.e., individuals whose rule-breaking and dissocial behavior has led to legal action or punishment. \n\nA limitation of this meta-analyis (but meta-analyses in general) is that not all available functional imaging studies on psychopathy fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The exclusion of studies restricting their analyses to a limited numbers of regions (i.e., region-of-interest approaches) may explain why our meta-analysis did not locate reliably altered activity in regions that one would have expected from the literature, e.g., the orbitofrontal cortex. However, it did confirm abnormalities in other notorious regions implicated in psychopathy such as the amygdala. Both regions are part of a \u201cparalimbic system\u201d that has been proposed to be dysfunctional in psychopathy by Kiehl and colleagues  and i.a. includes the insula, which also emerged in our meta-analysis. In short, our analyses corroborate the paralimbic system dysfunction model of psychopathy, if not with respect to every implicated region. Another model of psychopathy by Blair and colleagues proposed a deficit in the so-called violence inhibition mechanism, which normally leads to a withdrawal reaction of the aggressor when another individual shows signs of distress.  Proper functioning of this mechanism has been assumed to be a prerequisite for moral and empathic social behavior.  The meta-analytic finding of altered activity in a region for cognitive control (right lateral prefrontal cortex) and moral cognition (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) might be regarded as neurobiological underpinning of this neurocognitive model of psychopathy. \n\nIt is noteworthy that the functional characterization of the regions that we found in our meta-analysis matches well with aberrant behavioral patterns observed in psychopaths. However, it has to be kept in mind that the putatively underlying neuropsychological deficits might reflect overall alterations, whereas the neural alterations might be rather specific to a particular construct. Alternatively, the neuropsychological deficits might reflect specific alterations, while the neural differences might be rather generic effects in polymodal regions of the cortex.  We would thus argue that the decoding findings suggest specific avenues to test the dominant neurobiological accounts of psychopathy. \n\nIn summary, our analyses robustly pinpoint aberrant brain activity related to psychopathy in prefrontal, insular, and limbic regions. These regions may serve as targets for pharmacological interventions or brain stimulation techniques. Their alterations in activity may be based on structural brain changes. The finding of aberrant activity in both limbic and prefrontal regions may reconcile Kiehl\u2019s paralimbic dysfunction hypothesis  with Blair\u2019s violence-inhibition-mechanism-deficit theory . Furthermore, our results objectively illustrate that the (physiological) mental functions fulfilled by the respective brain regions correspond with the deviant behavioral patterns that are characteristic of psychopathy. In other words, the results show that aberrant brain activity may not just be an epiphenomenon of psychopathy but directly related to the psychopathology of this disorder. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6344321, "text_md5": "1d6fc15119d7fc7db7205c4580942f90", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 183], "journal": [184, 198], "publication_year": [200, 204], "title": [215, 304], "keywords": [318, 318], "abstract": [331, 2187], "body": [2196, 26516]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 30038232, "doi": "10.1038/s41380-018-0122-5", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6344321", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6344321"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6344321\">6344321</a>", "list_title": "PMC6344321  A View Behind the Mask of Sanity: Meta-Analysis of Aberrant Brain Activity in Psychopaths"}

In the present study, we set out to test whether shared neural representations between first-hand pain and empathy for pain are pain-specific or extend to empathy for unpleasant affective touch as well. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychopharmacological experiments, we investigated if placebo analgesia reduces first-hand and empathic experiences of affective touch, and compared them with the effects on pain. Placebo analgesia also affected the first-hand and empathic experience of unpleasant touch, implicating domain-general effects. However, and in contrast to pain and pain empathy, administering an opioid antagonist did not block these effects. Moreover, placebo analgesia reduced neural activity related to both modalities in the bilateral insular cortex, while it specifically modulated activity in the anterior midcingulate cortex for pain and pain empathy. These findings provide causal evidence that one of the major neurochemical systems for pain regulation is involved in pain empathy, and crucially substantiates the role of shared representations in empathy. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThere is an ongoing controversy about whether or not empathy relies on similar neuro-cognitive processes as the ones engaged when experiencing an emotion oneself (see review;  ). One specific discussion concerns whether overlapping neural activity observed during pain and empathy for pain indicates the same or different underlying processes (see review;  ). Several studies have consistently shown that experimentally induced analgesia not only reduces first-hand pain, but also reduces empathy for pain in a similar way and to a similar extent. This was associated with reduced amplitudes of pain event-related potentials ( ;  ), and lower brain activation in areas associated with pain and pain empathy ( ). Furthermore, these effects are related to an opioidergic mechanism, as administration of the opioid antagonist naltrexone blocked the effects of placebo analgesia both for pain and pain empathy. Related findings have been reported for the painkiller acetaminophen, which reduces pain empathy as well ( ), and social learning about threats delivered to another person ( ). Together, such findings indicate that the brain processes pain and the witnessing of pain in another individual in a similar manner, thus lending support to the notion of shared representations between self and other ( ;  ). \n\nFrom a conceptual and methodological point of view, the critical advance of these studies was the experimental manipulation of self-experienced pain, by means of cognitive and pharmacological manipulations. This would allow more specific and potentially causal conclusions on the neural and cognitive mechanisms underpinning the processing of other people\u2019s pain, fostering evidence, and theory building that could potentially overcome the limitations of previous work that had predominantly been based on correlational methods ( ;  ;  ). However, one key assumption that needs to be made in order to fully exploit the potential of this approach is that the experimentally induced placebo analgesia will act on pain specifically. However, if it (also) acts on domain-general processes, such as for example, the processing of unspecific negative affective states, then its effects on empathy might have resulted from a general blunting of affect. The findings would thus need to be interpreted differently, such as that pain empathy is grounded in the processing of negative affect, rather than in pain specifically. Testing the specificity for pain thus needs further causal manipulations and an assessment of their outcome on different domains or modalities. Related attempts have been successful in nonhuman animal research. Using a combination of electrophysiological recordings and transient lesions, a specific sharing of neural responses to self-experienced and vicariously experienced pain has recently been demonstrated in rats ( ). \n\nAssessing whether these findings translate to humans and their more complex models of affect sharing is thus a timely and imperative endeavor. The present rigorous investigation of the specificity of our own and related previous findings in humans is also motivated by ample indications that analgesia induced by either placebo or analgesics might have domain-general effects on negative and possibly even on positive affect, in addition to pain-specific effects. For instance,   revealed that placebo analgesia also reduced the unpleasantness of romantic rejection, along with an increase of neural activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during both pain and rejection-related unpleasantness. In addition, a recent meta-analysis cast some doubts on the specificity of the effects of placebo analgesia on self-experienced pain ( ). By indicating that only moderate parts of reduced neural activation were related to early nociceptive processing, this analysis suggested that placebo analgesia may predominantly exert its effects by acting on other, possibly later aspects of the multidimensional experience of pain, such as affective and evaluative processes. These may include processes that are involved in different aspects of general emotional states and thus show limited specificity to the pain experience. Moreover, the opioidergic mechanism involved in placebo analgesia might partly operate via the reward system, and thus the modulation of positive affect ( ). In line with this idea, it has been shown that remifentanil, a potent mu-opioid-receptor agonist, changed pleasantness ratings of affective pictures ( ). \n\nIn light of the doubts that these observations may cast on the previously assumed shared mechanism underlying analgesia and pain empathy, the present work tested the specificity of the effects of placebo analgesia on pain empathy (which were previously published;  ). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and psychopharmacological administration experiments, we investigated whether placebo analgesia also reduces empathy for nonpainful negative and positive emotions induced by affective touch, as well as their first-hand experience. In brief, the results provide support for both domain-general and pain-specific mechanisms. Placebo analgesia was associated with reduced first-hand experience of unpleasant (but nonpainful) touch as well as empathy for such touch. Crucially, these effects were not modulated by the opioid system, as administration of the opioid antagonist naltrexone did not block them, while it clearly did for pain and pain empathy. Pain-specificity in placebo empathy analgesia was further corroborated by the fMRI findings, which showed no placebo effects on touch in the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), while a modulation of activation in these areas was present for first-hand pain and empathy for pain. This suggests that the placebo effects on pain and unpleasant touch were driven by distinct neuro-cognitive and neuro-chemical processes, and highlights a specific role of the opioid system for sharing another person\u2019s pain. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nAll participants were right-handed, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and had no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. Further exclusion criteria were past or present substance abuse, use of psychopharmaceuticals within the last 3 months, and pregnancy (all assessed by urine tests). Participants were recruited via advertisements posted at local universities. Written consent was obtained at the outset of the study, with the consent form including elements of deception regarding the experimental design, the placebo treatment, and the confederate. The study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 2013). All participants were reimbursed for their participation. The sample of the psychopharmacological experiment was independent of the sample of the fMRI experiment. \n\n#### fMRI Experiment \n  \nA total of 120 healthy right-handed volunteers (Vienna university students) were randomly assigned to a control (  n  \u00a0=\u200960; 38 females, 22 males) or a placebo group (  n  \u00a0=\u200960, 43 females, 17 males). In total, 19 participants had to be excluded from the analysis, mainly because they were classified as nonresponders to the placebo manipulation (10 exclusions, see   for information on exclusion criteria), but also because of technical problems (such as partial malfunctioning of the fMRI scanner; 9 exclusions, 8 of them in the control group). All analyses reported in the present paper were carried out with the remaining 101 participants. The sample was identical to the one in  , except for one female control subject, who did not complete fMRI scanning of the touch paradigm this paper is focusing on (final sample control group:   n  \u00a0=\u200952, 33 females, 19 males; mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM\u2009=\u200926.18\u2009\u00b1\u20090.61; placebo group:   n  \u00a0=\u200949, 36 females, 13 males; mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM\u2009=\u200924.59\u2009\u00b1\u20090.41). \n\n\n#### Psychopharmacological Experiment \n  \nWe used a double-blind, placebo-controlled between-subjects design. Fifty-seven healthy right-handed volunteers (Vienna university students; 28 female, 29 male, mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM\u2009=\u200925.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.41) were randomly assigned to a placebo-placebo (  n  \u00a0=\u200929, 13 females, 16 males) or a placebo-naltrexone group (  n  \u00a0=\u200928, 15 females, 13 males). Seven participants in total had to be excluded from the analysis, because of classification as nonresponders to the placebo manipulation (5 exclusions, 4 of them in the placebo-placebo group), or because of technical problems (2 exclusions in the placebo-naltrexone group). All analyses reported in the paper were carried out for the remaining 50 participants (identical sample as in  ; placebo-placebo group:   n  \u00a0=\u200925, 12 females, 13 males, mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM\u2009=\u200925.28\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75; placebo-naltrexone group:   n  \u00a0=\u200925, 12 females, 13 males, mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM\u2009=\u200925.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.52. \n\n\n\n### Tasks \n  \nThe following task descriptions apply to both the fMRI and the psychopharmacological experiment. To maximize comparability, all parameters (including timing and number of ratings) of the tasks were kept the same across both experiments. \n\n#### Empathy for Pain Paradigm \n  \nIn this task, short-lasting (500\u00a0ms) and individually calibrated painful or nonpainful electrical stimulation was delivered to participants, or to another person (a confederate of the experimenters). Trials were structured as follows: First, an arrow (2000\u00a0ms) indicated the   target   (self vs. other) of the upcoming stimulus. The intensity of the upcoming stimulus was indicated by the color of this arrow (red: painful vs. green: nonpainful). After a jittered blank screen (3500\u2009\u00b1\u20091500\u00a0ms), the electrical stimulus (500\u00a0ms) was delivered during simultaneous presentation of another visual delivery stimulus (1000\u00a0ms). The latter consisted of a picture of the confederate\u2019s face, shown with either a painful or a neutral expression, or, in case of self-directed stimulation, scrambled versions of these pictures were shown to control for visual stimulation. Depending on the stimulus category, these pictures were accompanied by either a red (painful) or green (nonpainful) flash in the lower right corner of the picture. The delivery cue was followed by a fixation cross (5000\u2009\u00b1\u20092500\u00a0ms), and an optional rating (self-directed: one rating question; other-directed: two rating questions; 6000-ms answering time per each question). After self-directed stimulation, participants rated their own pain (self-directed pain ratings), using the question \u201cHow painful was this stimulus for you?\u201d on a seven-point rating scale ranging from \u201cnot at all\u201d to \u201cextremely painful.\u201d After other-directed stimulation, participants rated the other person\u2019s pain (other-directed pain ratings; \u201cHow painful was this stimulus for the other person?\u201d answered using the same seven-point rating scale as for the self-directed pain ratings), as well as their own unpleasantness during other-directed stimulation (unpleasantness ratings; \u201cHow unpleasant did it feel when the other person was stimulated?\u201d; seven-point scale, from \u201cnot at all\u201d to \u201cextremely unpleasant\u201d). Ratings were collected in about one third of the trials in a pseudorandomized fashion. Between trials, a fixation cross (2000\u00a0ms) was presented. In sum, 15 trials per condition (i.e., self-directed pain/no pain; other-directed pain/no pain) were presented. Participants were instructed to empathize with the other person. \n\nFor more details, see  . \n  \nStimulus examples and timeline. (  A  ) Examples of stimuli of each valence (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral), depicting images and the actual object used for concurrent tactile stimulation. (  B  ) Timeline of a single trial including a rating. \n  \n\n#### Touch Paradigm \n  \nFollowing the empathy for pain paradigm, we applied a touch paradigm ( ;  ) including 15 pleasant, 15 unpleasant and 15 neutral stimuli in pseudo-randomized order (see also  ). This paradigm consisted of two separate runs: In the first run (self-directed affective touch), the participant was stimulated to measure behavioral responses and brain activation related to the first-hand experience of affective touch. In the second run (empathy for affective touch) a confederate acting as a second participant was supposedly undergoing affective touch, and participants were instructed to empathize with her feelings. In every single self-directed trial, visual presentation of an object was accompanied by simultaneous stroking of the left palm at 1\u00a0Hz for 2\u00a0s in proximal-to-distal direction with a material whose touch resembled the touch of the object depicted on the screen. For example, touching the participant\u2019s hand with down feathers was accompanied by the picture of a chick to elicit a pleasant affective touch experience. The stimuli had been selected in extensive pretesting based on maximum agreement among participants in terms of congruency between visual and somatosensory stimulus and emotional responses (see   for paradigm validation test). In one third of the trials (5 per condition), participants were asked to rate the stimulation in that trial on a 9-point scale ranging from very unpleasant (left extreme of the scale) to very pleasant (right extreme) for either themselves or, supposedly, for the other participant (i.e., the confederate). Each single trial consisted of a jittered fixation cross (5000\u2009+\u2009\u22122000\u00a0ms), followed by visuo-tactile stimulation (2000\u00a0ms) and a jittered blank screen (1500\u2009+\u2009\u22121000\u00a0ms). In trials with ratings, the rating was presented after the jittered blank screen for 5000\u00a0ms and was followed by another jittered blank screen (1500\u2009+\u2009\u22121000\u00a0ms). Other-directed trials were identical apart from the absence of tactile stimulation of the participant, and the instruction that participants should empathize with their feelings. \n\n\n\n### Procedures \n  \nAfter an initial screening procedure, participants who fulfilled inclusion criteria were invited to a single fMRI session (or behavioral session, in case of the psychopharmacological experiment). After being introduced to another participant, who was a confederate of the experimenters, they underwent a calibration procedure (for obtaining individually adjusted pain intensities for every single subject). Then, participants were instructed about the different parts of the experimental session, which were presented as two entirely independent experiments within the same study \u201cto use scanning time efficiently and to reduce recruitment efforts.\u201d Participants of the placebo group underwent a placebo analgesia induction procedure (see next section for details), and knew beforehand that they would receive pain medication. During the induction procedure, special care was taken not to suggest (explicitly or implicitly) any general effects on the processing of unpleasant affect, as our findings would be of limited conclusiveness otherwise. To avoid eliciting expectations of either positive or negative effects on empathic pain and on touch, we emphasized the independence of the experimental tasks and the potency of the medication as a painkiller without side effects. Also, during the instruction, we intentionally avoided addressing general effects of the medication beyond pain reduction, such as emotional blunting or reduced negative affect. Thus, the participants were expected to develop specific beliefs and expectations regarding their own pain processing, but not on somatosensory or affect processing, when directed neither to themselves nor to the other. \n\nThen, both the participant and the confederate went into the scanner room, where the confederate was seated at a wooden table next to the scanner, with a computer screen replica placed on it. After the participant had been positioned in the scanner, the confederate left the scanner room without the participant being able to notice it. Instructions that were given over the loudspeakers were always addressed to both the participant and the confederate, to enhance the participant\u2019s belief into the confederate\u2019s ongoing presence in the scanner room. The participants went through the experimental tasks in the following order. First, the pain and empathy for pain paradigm (duration: 15\u00a0min) was completed. Then, the self-directed affective touch run (duration: 10\u00a0min) was conducted, followed by the empathy for affective touch run (duration: 10\u00a0min). The order of the touch runs was fixed in this way as prior experience with the touch items was necessary for participants to accurately empathize with the affective touch of the other person. A fixed order between the pain and touch tasks was chosen to maximize the homogeneity of placebo analgesia responses in the pain task. After an anatomical scan and resting state scan, the participant left the scanner, filled in post-experimental questionnaires, and was debriefed. \n\n\n### Placebo Induction in the fMRI Experiment \n  \nFull details on the placebo induction procedure can be found in  . In short, participants in the placebo group were introduced to a medical doctor who administered a placebo pill presented as a highly effective as well as expensive ( ) pain killer without side effects. They were told that this medication would considerably reduce their pain and that the aim of the study was to study its effects on brain activation. After 15\u00a0min waiting time, allegedly for the medication to take effect, the placebo analgesic effect was amplified by a procedure with several conditioning trials. Such combinations of verbal instructions and conditioning trials have been shown to be very effective in inducing robust placebo effects (see review;  ), which last up to several hours or even days after successful conditioning (e.g.,  ;  ). Importantly, it was communicated explicitly to participants that they were the only ones receiving the analgesic, while the second participant (i.e., the confederate) would not receive any medication. \n\n\n### Placebo Induction in the Psychopharmacological Experiment \n  \nThis experiment was largely identical to the fMRI experiment, but it involved additional administration of a pharmacological compound to half of the participants, in a double-blinded (between-subjects) fashion. The placebo analgesia induction procedure differed from the one in the fMRI experiment in one respect, which was that after the initial administration of a placebo pill and the conditioning procedure, participants received another pill (supposedly to strengthen the analgesic effects). This pill was the one that included either the opioid antagonist naltrexone, or starch (placebo). The rationale of this procedure was directly motivated by previous placebo analgesia research (see, e.g.,  ), and served to investigate opioidergically mediated placebo analgesia effects once induced by the administration of the inert pill and the conditioning procedure. Following the peak level at about 50\u00a0min after administration, naltrexone plasma levels have been shown to be stable for at least 2\u00a0h ( ). In the present study, the touch paradigm immediately followed the empathy for pain paradigm, with a maximum starting point of 70\u00a0min after naltrexone administration. Thus, naltrexone medication effects were expected to persist over the whole course of the experimental tasks (which lasted 35\u00a0min in total), including the part when the affective touch task was performed. \n\n\n### fMRI Acquisition and Statistical Analysis \n  \nData were acquired on a 3\u00a0T Siemens Tim Trio MRI System (Siemens Medical), using a multiband accelerated echoplanar imaging sequence (TE/TR\u2009=\u200933/1800\u00a0ms; voxel size 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u00a0mm) (see details;  ). Data preprocessing was carried out in SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging,  ) using default settings unless specified differently. Preprocessing of data from the pain and the touch tasks were carried out in the exact same way. This included slice timing correction (reference\u2009=\u2009first slice), motion correction, spatial normalization to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotactic space using an in-house scanner-specific EPI template, and spatial smoothing (6\u00a0mm Gaussian kernel). The scanner-specific template was generated from EPI data sets of 339 subjects all acquired on our own scanner using the iterative algorithm in the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) toolbox ( ). For this study, all individual data sets were normalized to this template and then transformed to MNI space using ANTs. Thresholds for excessive head movement were applied in accordance with acquired voxel size. Data analysis was performed based on a general linear model approach. The first-level design matrix of each subject contained 7 regressors: self-directed unpleasant touch, other-directed unpleasant touch, self-directed pleasant touch, other-directed pleasant touch, self-directed neutral touch, other-directed neutral touch, rating. For each condition, we modeled the 2\u00a0s time period of the affective touch and convolved them with SPM12\u2019s standard canonical hemodynamic response function. Six realignment parameters for translation and rotation were included as additional nuisance regressors. Group statistics were calculated using second-level random effects analyses in SPM12. \n\nIn our previous work ( ), we had shown that placebo analgesia reduces activation in areas that had previously been related to empathy for pain. The aim of the present study was to test pain-specificity of these previous results and to identify general and modality-specific placebo effects for pain and touch in self-experience and empathy. Our general analysis approach was, thus, as follows: First, we analyzed whether placebo effects on the processing of unpleasant and pleasant touch stimuli could be observed at all (which was the case for unpleasant touch). Second, we tested whether the placebo effects related to affective touch engaged similar brain areas as the placebo effects related to pain. As for the first step, analyses of group differences were confined to a priori selected and independently determined areas of interest (AOIs) based on previous work. Selection of the AOIs was guided by our previous work ( ), which had revealed the insular and orbitofrontal cortices (OFC) as the main areas associated with processing self- and other-directed unpleasant and pleasant touch, respectively. Due to differences to our previous work regarding relevant experimental parameters (shorter stimulation and higher number of trials in our current work), we decided to tailor the AOIs to our current sample. Group differences regarding unpleasant touch were thus analyzed in an AOI based on the conjunction self-unpleasant \u2229 other-unpleasant (in all participants of the fMRI experiment), restricted to anatomical left and right insular cortex (IC). Regarding pleasant touch, the AOI was based on the conjunction self-pleasant \u2229 other-pleasant (in all participants), restricted to anatomical OFC (anatomical areas as delineated in the automated anatomical labeling atlas;  ; created using the WFU Pick atlas version 2.3;  ). \n\nFor the second step, that is, to test for the overlap of areas associated with pain and unpleasant touch-related placebo effects, we performed group comparisons (control group\u2009>\u2009placebo group) in the anatomically defined bilateral IC ( ) (as above, using the WFU Pick atlas) and aMCC ( ). The latter was created with ITK-Snap ( ) by restricting the bilateral anatomical cingulate cortex (automated anatomical labeling atlas, as implemented in WFU Pick atlas) by the aMCC borders as described by  ), and comprised the aMCC in both hemispheres. Both the insula and the aMCC were revealed as crucial during both unpleasantness and pain processing in past studies ( ;  ). We decided against using regions of interest from our previous work on placebo analgesia and empathy ( ), where we had extracted mean activation from regions of interest derived from a pain empathy meta-analysis (specifically, the conjunction self-pain\u00a0\u2229\u00a0other-pain;  ), to avoid biasing the analysis towards specific subregions associated with pain and pain empathy only. This analysis thus allowed us to draw conclusions about shared as well as distinct placebo effects in the two modalities, pain and touch. Based on previous work on placebo analgesia ( ;  ;  ), multiple comparison correction was based on a family-wise error rate (  P  \u00a0<\u20090.05) using small volume correction (SVC, as implemented in SPM12), within the regions of interest (for SVC, we combined all three ROIs into one ROI and reported the resulting peaks). \n\nOn top of the analyses focusing on areas selected a priori, we also performed a complementary exploratory whole-brain analysis of group differences in the touch conditions. These analyses were corrected using FWE-correction with   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05 on the cluster-level across the whole brain. \n\n\n### Behavioral Measures Analysis \n  \nStatistical analyses of behavioral measures were performed using SPSS 18.0 (Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences, Version 18.0, SPSS Inc.) and the level of significance was set to   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05. Our analysis approach consisted of the following steps: First, we ran a repeated-measure ANOVA including the factor valence (pleasant vs. unpleasant) on the self-report ratings in the control group as a validity check of the paradigm. This check was successful and is reported in  . Second, we focused on a priori planned comparisons to test our main hypothesis, which was that the placebo manipulation resulted not only in a reduction of the first-hand experience of touch, but also of empathy for affective touch. These planned comparisons consisted of two-tailed   t  -tests for independent samples, which first tested whether ratings delivered after (pleasant or unpleasant) affective touch of oneself differed between the placebo and the control group, and then whether this was also the case for ratings of empathy for affective touch. Finally, a third independent-samples   t  -test examined whether the predicted reduction of empathy was of similar size as the reduction of the self-directed experience (i.e., a   t  -test comparing the group difference placebo\u2014control for self-directed affective touch, with the same difference for empathy for affective touch). We also performed a complimentary 2 (target)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (valence)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (group) mixed-model ANOVA (\u201cgroup\u201d: placebo vs. control, or placebo-placebo vs. placebo-naltrexone; \u201cvalence\u201d: pleasant vs. unpleasant; \u201ctarget\u201d: self vs. other). This aimed at assessing whether the experimental conditions produced significant variation in the data, which was tested by follow-up pair-wise comparisons in case of significant main effects or interactions. Results of this ANOVA are reported in  . Except for the first ANOVA (paradigm validation), the joint analysis of ratings related to unpleasant versus pleasant touch required a scale-transformation so that all ratings were on the scale with positive values. This was achieved by reversing the sign of ratings delivered during unpleasant stimulation (see also  ;  ). Bayesian statistics were used to further qualify our findings: These allow testing of null hypotheses by assessing strength of evidence in favor of either H0 or H1 ( ;  ) and enabled us to estimate the odds in favor of having obtained true null results. In Bayesian statistics, probabilities are indicated by the so-called Bayes Factor BF \u00a0=\u00a0  P  (Data|H1)/  P  (Data|H0); BF \u00a0=\u00a0  P  (Data|H0)/  P  (Data|H1). Thus, BF \u00a0>\u20091 means that the H0 is more likely than the H1. BF \u00a0<\u20091/3 is commonly interpreted as evidence for the H1, while BF \u00a0>\u20093 is usually interpreted as substantial evidence for the H0, though such absolute thresholds should be used with some caution ( ;  ). BF  refers to a BF used to test the alternative hypothesis that there is a difference between groups, represented as a half-normal distribution with a standard deviation (SD) of   x  , against H0, the hypothesis of no difference ( ). BF  and BF  indicate one-tailed tests. BFs can be interpreted continuously, with a BF of 4 providing twice as much evidence as compared with a BF of 2. \n\nBayesian   t  -tests were also used to test the similarity of placebo effects on pain and touch (both self and other, see \u201cComparing placebo effects on pain and touch\u201d) and to follow up nonsignificant effects of the psychopharmacological manipulation on affective touch (H0: Naltrexone-effect on pain, but not on unpleasant touch vs. H1: Naltrexone having an effect on both modalities, pain and touch). For the latter, we used an evidence-based prior (between-groups pain effect size from the psychopharmacological experiment) for testing these hypotheses in both self-directed (  x  \u00a0=\u20090.61) and other-directed (  x  \u00a0=\u20090.69) unpleasant touch data. On top, we performed three additional analyses per target (self/other), using different SDs, depending on prior effect sizes (results of these additional tests are reported in  : in a similar fashion as for the first evidence-based prior, we used the between-groups pain effect size priors from the fMRI experiment (self-directed:   x  \u00a0=\u20090.72; other-directed:   x  \u00a0=\u20090.53) to estimate the probability of the data under the two hypotheses. Second, in order to compare the strength of the between-group effects for self-directed unpleasant touch in the fMRI versus the psychopharmacological experiment, we used the between-groups (=placebo effect) unpleasant touch effect size prior in the fMRI experiment (self-directed:   x  \u00a0=\u20090.58; other-directed:   x  \u00a0=\u20090.53). Third, we used an objective prior of   x  \u00a0=\u20090.707. Bayes factors (BFs) were computed with JASP ( ). A repeated measures ANOVA with the within-subjects factors \u201cparadigm\u201d (pain vs. touch) and \u201ctarget\u201d (self vs. other), and the between-subjects factor \u201cgroup\u201d (placebo-naltrexone vs. placebo-placebo) was conducted as a complementary frequentist analysis. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nOur analysis approach for identifying common versus distinct neural mechanisms underlying pain, touch, and their empathic experience, consisted of three steps: First, we tested for placebo effects on affective touch (\u201cPlacebo effects on affective touch\u201d). Second, the psychopharmacological experiment aimed to provide causal evidence whether an opioidergic mechanism was also underpinning the placebo effects on affective touch and empathy, as it did for pain (\u201cOpioidergic modulation of placebo effects\u201d). Third, assessing the correspondence in brain activations related to placebo effects on pain and touch, and their empathic experience, allowed us to corroborate the findings from the opioidergic modulation experiment (\u201cDomain-general and pain-specific placebo effects on brain activation\u201d). \n\n### Behavioral Results\u2014fMRI Experiment \n  \n#### Placebo Effects on Affective Touch \n  \nPlanned comparisons for unpleasant touch revealed reduced unpleasant affect ratings in the placebo compared with the control group, in both self- and other-directed ratings (self-directed:   t  (99)\u2009=\u20092.42,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.017,   d  \u00a0=\u20090.48, BF \u00a0=\u20092.75, mean ratings\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: control group\u2009=\u2009\u22122.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14, placebo group\u2009=\u2009\u22122.40\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19; other-directed:   t  (99)\u2009=\u20092.67,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.009,   d  \u00a0=\u20090.53, BF \u00a0=\u20094.75, mean ratings\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: control group\u2009=\u2009\u22123.62\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14, placebo group\u2009=\u2009\u22123.04\u2009\u00b1\u20090.17; see  ). The magnitude of these effects did not differ (  t  (99)\u2009=\u20090.013,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.989, BF \u00a0=\u20094.76), indicating that the placebo manipulation reduced the unpleasantness of first-hand touch and its empathic experience to a similar extent. Placebo analgesia had no effect on pleasant touch ratings, neither when touch was directed to the self (  P  \u00a0=\u20090.87, BF \u00a0=\u20094.71; mean ratings\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: control group\u2009=\u20092.79\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16, placebo group\u2009=\u20092.83\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15) or to the other person (  P  \u00a0=\u20090.28, BF \u00a0=\u20092.85; mean ratings\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: control group\u2009=\u20092.86\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14, placebo group\u2009=\u20093.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12). See   for complete factorial analysis, and R1.1 for results of the successful paradigm validation check. \n  \nBehavioral results of the two experiments, showing that while placebo analgesia reduced unpleasantness of touch ratings, this was not underpinned by an opioidergic mechanism. Left panels: touch data. Right panels: pain data. (  A  ) fMRI experiment (  N  \u00a0=\u200952/49): ratings of pleasant touch revealed no group differences, while the unpleasantness of both self- and other-directed unpleasant touch was significantly reduced in the placebo group, similar to pain and pain empathy. (  B  ) Psychopharmacological experiment (  N  \u00a0=\u200925/25): administration of the opioid antagonist naltrexone had no influence on ratings of affective touch in any of the four conditions (all   P  -values\u2009>\u20090.123), while it increased pain and empathy for pain. Asterisks (  P  \u00a0<\u20090.05,   P  \u00a0<\u20090.01) mark significant planned comparisons (independent samples   t  -tests, see text for detailed results). BF  values are BFs in favor of the null hypothesis (i.e., no effect of naltrexone). \n  \n\n#### Comparing Placebo Effects on Pain and Touch \n  \nTo test whether placebo effects on unpleasant touch were comparable with those on pain, we performed Bayesian   t  -tests on unpleasant touch, employing effect size priors from pain. These analyses revealed BF \u00a0=\u20090.22, for self-directed unpleasant touch, and BF \u00a0=\u20090.10 for other-directed unpleasant touch. This indicates placebo effects of similar extent in the two modalities, for both the self- and the other-directed conditions. \n\n\n\n### Behavioral Results\u2014Psychopharmacological Experiment \n  \n#### Opioidergic Modulation of Placebo Effects \n  \nPlanned comparisons testing whether naltrexone administration led to modulation of placebo effects on self- or other-directed affective touch revealed no significant effects in any of the conditions (unpleasant: self   t  (48)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.577,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.566, BF \u00a0=\u20093.08, mean ratings\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: placebo-naltrexone group\u2009=\u2009\u22122.09\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26, placebo-placebo group\u2009=\u2009\u22122.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29; other   t  (36.84)\u2009=\u20090.974,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.337, BF \u00a0=\u20092.39, mean ratings\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: placebo-naltrexone group\u2009=\u2009\u22123.41\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16, placebo-placebo group\u2009=\u2009\u22123.07\u2009\u00b1\u20090.31; pleasant: self   t  (48)\u2009=\u20090.876,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.385, BF \u00a0=\u20092.58, mean ratings\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: placebo-naltrexone group\u2009=\u20093.14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21, placebo-placebo group\u2009=\u20092.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23; other   t  (48)\u2009=\u20091.571,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.123, BF \u00a0=\u20091.29, mean ratings\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: placebo-naltrexone group\u2009=\u20093.35\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21, placebo-placebo group\u2009=\u20092.79\u2009\u00b1\u20090.28; see  ). See   for complete factorial analysis. This was in stark contrast to the previously reported effects on pain and pain empathy, where substantial and significant effects had been found, in the same participants. To assess the likelihood of a true null finding for naltrexone effects on unpleasant touch (H0) over a possible effect on both pain and unpleasant touch (H1: similar effects of naltrexone on both modalities), we thus carried out Bayesian   t  -tests on the group differences for unpleasant touch in the psychopharmacological experiment, using evidence-based distributions as priors (as suggested by  ). Using effect sizes of naltrexone on placebo effects for pain as priors resulted in BF \u00a0=\u20092.76 for self-directed unpleasant touch (i.e., favoring H0 over H1 by 2.76 times), and BF \u00a0=\u20092.35 for other-directed unpleasant touch. See   for additional Bayesian analyses supporting these results when incorporating priors based on other evidence, as well as neutral priors. These analyses suggest that naltrexone had no modulatory effects on first-hand or empathic experiences of unpleasant affective touch, in comparison with pain, where it clearly did. Also, see   for an alternative frequentist analysis incorporating both pain and touch data, which yielded similar results. \n\n\n#### Comparison of Placebo Effects in fMRI and Psychopharmacological Experiments \n  \nSince the fMRI and the psychopharmacological experiments had been performed in different samples, the lack of naltrexone effects in the psychopharmacological experiment could in principle be related to failure in inducing robust placebo analgesia effects in the latter. To assess this possible confound, we compared the placebo-placebo group of the psychopharmacological experiment to the placebo and the control groups of the fMRI experiment. There was no difference between the two groups that had undergone a more or less identical placebo induction procedure: ratings in the placebo\u2013placebo group from the psychopharmacological experiment and from the placebo group in the fMRI experiment did not differ, regarding neither unpleasant nor pleasant touch (unpleasant self:   t  (72)\u2009=\u20090.085,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.806, BF \u00a0=\u20093.86; other:   t  (72)\u2009=\u20090.093,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.926, BF \u00a0=\u20093.95; pleasant self:   t  (72)\u2009=\u20090.246,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.932, BF \u00a0=\u20093.95, other:   t  (72)\u2009=\u20090.994,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.323, BF \u00a0=\u20092.60). However, the placebo-placebo group from the psychopharmacological experiment significantly differed from the control group of the fMRI experiment regarding unpleasantness ratings (self:   t  (75)\u2009=\u20092.323,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.023,   d  \u00a0=\u20090.56, BF \u00a0=\u20092.40; other:   t  (33.36)\u2009=\u20091.618,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.115,   d  \u00a0=\u20090.42, BF \u00a0=\u20091.13), but not regarding pleasant touch ratings (self: BF \u00a0=\u20093.93; other: BF \u00a0=\u20093.91). We also compared the placebo effects within and across experiments with a Bayesian approach. Using effect size priors of placebo effects in the fMRI experiment, we calculated BF  in a Bayesian one-sided   t  -test on the group difference between fMRI-control group and placebo-placebo group (psychopharmacological), which revealed BF \u00a0=\u20090.19 for self-directed unpleasant touch, and BF \u00a0=\u20090.41 for other-directed unpleasant touch, which indicates similarly strong placebo effects in the psychopharmacological experiment. Taken together, these results suggest that the placebo induction in the psychopharmacological experiment had similarly strong effects on touch as in the fMRI experiment, ruling out an alternative explanation for the lack of naltrexone effects on unpleasant touch. Neutral touch ratings were neither significantly influenced by placebo analgesia (all   P  -values\u2009>\u20090.662) nor by naltrexone (all   P  -values\u2009>\u20090.225). \n\n\n\n### Imaging Results \n  \n#### Placebo Effects on Affective Touch \n  \nThe first set of fMRI analyses, which aimed at revealing the neural correlates of placebo analgesia effects on affective touch (tested in a priori selected and independently determined AOI based on previous work ( ); see methods for details), revealed lower activation during self-directed   unpleasant touch   in the placebo group in several parts of the bilateral anterior insula (contrast [self-unpleasant: control group\u2009>\u2009placebo group],   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05, small-volume family-wise error corrected [SVC-FWE]). For other-directed unpleasant touch, a similar group difference was indicated in the right anterior insula (contrast [other-unpleasant: control group\u2009>\u2009placebo group],   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05, SVC). See   for further details. Analyses of group differences for   pleasant touch   revealed no significant effects, which is in line with the absence of behavioral effects ([self-pleasant: control group\u2009>\u2009placebo group] and [other-pleasant: control group\u2009>\u2009placebo group]). None of the reverse contrasts (testing for higher activation in the placebo group) showed significant results either. \n  \nSignificant activation when testing for the neural correlates of placebo effects on unpleasant touch (contrasts: self-unpleasant: control\u2009>\u2009placebo group, and other-unpleasant: control\u2009>\u2009placebo group) and pleasant touch (contrasts: self-pleasant: control\u2009>\u2009placebo group, and other-pleasant: control\u2009>\u2009placebo group), small-volume-corrected   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05 in bilateral anterior IC\u2009=\u2009insular cortex (unpleasant touch)/orbitofrontal cortex (pleasant touch),   k  \u00a0=\u2009cluster size, MNI\u2009=\u2009Montreal Neurological Institute stereotactic space \n  \n\n#### Complementary Exploratory Whole-Brain Analyses \n  \nThe contrast (self-unpleasant: control group\u2009>\u2009placebo group) revealed activation in the fusiform gyrus, left primary and bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex, anterior insula and posterior insula, and the contrast (other-unpleasant: control group\u2009>\u2009placebo group) in the left fusiform gyrus and right secondary somatosensory cortex (for details refer to Supplement,   and  ). The corresponding contrasts for pleasant touch indicated activation differences in visual areas (fusiform gyrus, middle occipital gyrus; see Supplement,   and  ). The reverse contrasts (all conditions: placebo group\u2009>\u2009control group) did not reveal any significant differences. \n\n\n#### Domain-General and Pain-Specific Placebo Effects on Brain Activation \n  \nTo assess whether the effects of placebo analgesia on unpleasant touch were underpinned by similar or distinct areas as those modulated by placebo analgesia during pain processing, we tested for joint activations in pain and touch in the anatomically defined bilateral insula and aMCC. In the bilateral insula, this revealed reduced activation in the placebo group during pain and touch, both when self- and other-directed; these effects partially overlapped for self-directed pain and touch, but not at all for other-directed pain and touch. In the aMCC, however, no placebo effects on touch were found, while largely overlapping clusters were found for self- and other-directed pain.   visualizes the domain-general along with modality-specific placebo effects resulting from these analyses (for full details on cluster size, location, and statistical estimates, see  ). \n  \n(  A  \u00a0+\u00a0  B  ) Mass-univariate fMRI results of placebo effects on pain and unpleasant touch in the bilateral insula, demonstrating both domain-general and modality-specific placebo effects. Activation maps illustrate both overlapping (pain and touch; yellow) and nonoverlapping effects of placebo analgesia on self- (  A  ; maps in upper row; red\u2009=\u2009pain; green\u2009=\u2009touch) and other-directed (  B  ; maps in lower row; blue\u00a0=\u2009pain; beige\u00a0=\u2009touch) pain and touch, respectively (thresholded at   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05, small-volume-corrected in bilateral insula). (  C  ) Mass-univariate fMRI results of placebo effects on self- and other-directed pain in the aMCC, showing largely overlapping placebo effects for self- and other-directed pain. Importantly, this contrasts with the absence of such effects on unpleasant touch in this region (no activations surviving threshold). Activation maps illustrate effects of placebo analgesia on self-directed (red) and other-directed (blue) pain (overlap in purple). Thresholded at   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05, small-volume-corrected in aMCC. \n    \nSignificant activation when testing for placebo analgesia effects in unpleasant touch and pain in bilateral IC and aMCC \n  \nNotes: (A) Significant clusters resulting from the contrasts (self-unpleasant: control group\u2009>\u2009placebo group) and (other-unpleasant: control group\u2009>\u2009placebo group). (B) Significant clusters resulting from the contrasts (self-pain: control group\u2009>\u2009placebo group) and (other-pain: control group\u2009>\u2009placebo group) (small-volume-corrected   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05;   k  \u00a0=\u2009cluster size, MNI\u2009=\u2009Montreal Neurological Institute stereotactic space). \n  \nIn summary, the fMRI analyses revealed, first, the neural correlate of the selective placebo effects on unpleasant, but not on pleasant touch; second, modality-specific placebo modulation of pain and its empathic experience in the aMCC, where, in contrast, no placebo modulation of unpleasant touch was found; third, partially similar placebo modulation of self-directed pain and touch in the bilateral IC, but lateralized effects for other-directed pain (left AI) and touch (right AI). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nA series of previous studies using a variety of behavioral and neuroscience methods had consistently indicated that placebo analgesia also reduces empathy for pain ( ;  ;  ). Based on these results, it had been suggested that empathy for pain is grounded in self pain, that is, it recruits neural functions that also underpin first-hand pain processing (see review;  ). The present work set out to test the specificity of these findings, as previous research, including our own, would not allow to rule out the interpretation that reduced empathy resulted from a domain-general (i.e., applying to negative affective states in general vs. being specific to pain) blunting of (negative) affect by placebo analgesia. The findings reported here suggest both domain-general and modality-specific mechanisms. For one thing, the behavioral and neural data of the fMRI experiment suggest domain-general effects, by revealing that induction of placebo analgesia not only acted on pain and pain empathy, but that it also reduces negative affect resulting from unpleasant touch, and empathy for such touch. However, two observations speak for additional modality-specific mechanisms and crucially complement these findings. First, the placebo effects on unpleasant touch were not modulated by causally manipulating opioidergic activity, by means of administration of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Since previous results in the same sample of participants had shown such a modulation for pain and pain empathy, this suggests specificity of placebo effects on pain with regard to the underlying neurochemical mechanisms. Second, while placebo effects for both pain and touch were found in the insula, activity in the aMCC was specifically modulated by placebo for pain and empathy for pain, but not for touch, pointing towards a pain-specific mechanism and corroborating the psychopharmacological results by providing insights into the brain areas underpinning the distinct neurochemical mechanism. \n\nWe will now discuss these findings in some more detail. Behavioral data of both experiments indicate that unpleasant touch was experienced as less unpleasant in participants who had undergone placebo analgesia than in participants from the control group. Interestingly, empathy for such touch was also reduced, extending previous findings linking reduced first-hand affect processing to a reduced sharing of another person\u2019s affect to the domain of unpleasant touch. The placebo manipulation also showed similarly strong effects in both modalities (pain and touch) and for both conditions (self and empathy). In addition, the absence of effects related to pleasant touch contradicts the hypothesis of a   generalized blunting   of affect by placebo analgesia. \n\nSince our previous work had consistently indicated an opioidergic mechanism for the effects of placebo analgesia on both pain and pain empathy ( ;  ), the psychopharmacological experiment was crucial in terms of testing whether the domain-general effects on unpleasant affect were indeed underpinned by similar neural mechanisms. This experiment, however, showed that opioidergic blockade had no impact on how placebo affects the processing of unpleasant touch, contrasting the findings in the domain of pain. Importantly, the Bayesian analyses (as well as the complementary frequentist analysis) across modalities were specifically tailored to avoid unjustified conclusions solely based on significant differences in one, but not in the other condition ( ). These analyses further supported the interpretation of an absence of effects of naltrexone on unpleasant touch, rather than a lack of sensitivity to pick them up. This was shown in both a within-subject comparison and a between-subject comparison with the larger fMRI sample. Directly comparing the between-groups effects on unpleasant touch found in the fMRI (effects induced by placebo analgesia) and the psychopharmacological experiment (effects induced by naltrexone) also revealed a higher probability for a null-effect in the latter. Complementary frequentist analyses confirmed these results. Note though that some of the BFs were in a range (<3) that is considered only anecdotal evidence for the H0, which calls for replication in larger samples. Moreover, the two groups that had undergone placebo analgesia were comparable. Taken together, this indicates that the absence of effects by the opioid antagonist cannot be explained by insufficient analgesia induction, or that the two samples are not comparable to start with. \n\nThe fMRI data revealed that placebo effects on the processing of unpleasant affect were associated with activation differences in the insula, in a subdivision previously related to the processing of unpleasant touch ( ). Comparing pain- and unpleasant touch-related placebo effects revealed both overlapping and distinct subdivisions in the IC, but pain-specific effects in the aMCC. The overlapping activations could be interpreted as a neural correlate of the domain-general effects, while the modality-specific effects suggest that (1) the insula contains parts that are specifically and distinctly related to the representation of pain and touch, and that (2) the aMCC is exclusively (in the sense of not including touch) involved in the placebo modulation of pain. This is in line with recent fMRI findings showing that specific parts of the anterior insula seem to specifically code for pain expectations, and not for the domain-general processing of aversive affect ( ). In consistence with that, we found pain-specific involvement of the left AI. The modality-specific placebo modulation of pain in the aMCC is an especially noteworthy observation, considering its high density of mu-opioid receptors ( ;  ), along with recent reports of pain-specific multivariate representations in the aMCC ( ), which were clearly separable from negative emotion representations (that were represented in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex). Hence, these findings may pinpoint aMCC as the specific area mediating the modulation of opioidergic activity, seen in the psychopharmacological experiment. However, such a conclusion would require direct testing in a combined psychopharmacological and fMRI experiment. Also, absence of evidence for unpleasant touch modulation in the present study does not fully exclude a potential role of the aMCC in placebo effects on unpleasant touch. \n\nFrom these findings, we thus infer moderate but consistently stronger evidence for an opioidergic mechanism in the domain of pain compared with the domain of unpleasant touch. Note that these findings are based on rather large sample sizes for both fMRI and psychopharmacological research, and a within-subject design, thus excluding the potential confound that between-sample variation might have caused the different effect patterns for pain and touch. \n\nWe will now put our findings in a broader perspective, with respect to the phenomena of empathy and placebo analgesia. Theoretical accounts of shared neural representations between first-hand and empathic affective experiences have recently gained momentum through evidence from animal research and multivariate analysis approaches. A study by Corradi-dell\u2019Acqua and colleagues revealed a significant role of the anterior insula and the midcingulate cortex in processing both pain and disgust experiences related to self as well as others ( ). Crucially, in the same study, the authors also showed modality and target specific neural responses, indicating (similar to the present study) both domain-generality and modality-specificity. In their study, they used a multivariate analysis approach, targeting fine-grained neural patterns. In contrast, Krishnan and colleagues employed a similar technique and found no shared neural patterns for first-hand and vicarious pain experience ( ). This divergence could be caused by the nature of the employed tasks. While the former study employed closely matched cue-based tasks for self- and other-related experiences, Krishnan and colleagues compared neural responses to thermal pain (cue-based self-related pain task) with neural responses to imagining oneself being in a painful situation depicted on the screen. These tasks obviously differ in their complexity and the involved cognitive demands, and may therefore have biased the analysis towards the emergence of differences, rather than similarity. Moreover, the resolution of fMRI might be too low to identify shared activations even with the refined multivariate approach. This is why Carrillo and colleagues employed single-cell recordings and pharmacological \u201clesions\u201d in a rat model of empathy ( ). They elegantly demonstrated that a multivariate decoder can successfully predict self-experienced pain after being trained on observations of a conspecific in pain. This was specifically related to single neuron activities in the cingulate cortex, as shown by transient lesions of this region. These lesions further affected pain only, and not negative affect (fear) in general, which parallels our finding of pain-specific placebo modulation of the aMCC. \n\nPlacebo treatments\u2014that is, the creation of expectations about effects in the absence of any physical or pharmacological treatment\u2014are powerful tools for both basic research and clinical application (see reviews  ;  ;  ). They have been especially well-studied within the subfield of placebo analgesia (or, more precisely, hypoalgesia;  ). Also, placebo treatments have major effects on general emotional processes such as unpleasantness induced by threatening pictures ( ). A recent meta-analysis suggested that placebo analgesia exerts only a small effect on early sensory components of pain processing that are closely associated with the nociceptive signal. Instead, there seems to be a larger placebo effect on domain-general phenomena such as stress, subjective affect and cognitive evaluation ( ). Our neuroimaging data indicate that the cross-modal placebo effect relies on this rather domain-general unpleasant affect mechanism associated with activation of the IC. Some findings on the whole-brain level (reported in   and  ) are though interesting to note: placebo analgesia led to a downregulation of the fusiform gyrus during both self-experienced and empathic unpleasant touch. Decreased activity in the fusiform gyrus in response to unpleasant pictures has previously been found in placebo analgesia studies and has been related to treatment expectancies ( ). Decreased activity in somatosensory areas during self-experienced unpleasant touch is in line with the previously demonstrated role of somatosensory areas in attributing emotional value to self-directed affective touch ( ). Another interesting finding on the whole-brain level is the downregulation of the inferior frontal gyrus during empathic unpleasant touch. The inferior frontal gyrus has been shown to be relevant for evaluating social signals (e.g., interpreting smiles, see  )). Predictive coding processes have been suggested to play a fundamental role in placebo responses ( ;  ;  ). Predictive coding suggests that models of the world and the self (priors) are compared with input (e.g., nociceptive signals) and generate error signals in case of mismatch. The error signals may change the priors but also how the input is further processed. The subjective experience is then influenced both by the priors and the input signal. Expectations induced in a placebo treatment may be viewed as priors ( ;  ). In the present dataset, predictive coding may explain why there is no effect of the placebo analgesia induction on pleasant touch (as it is not part of the prediction) but some effect on unpleasant touch (as there are overlapping components in the underlying information processing with pain processing). However, although a prediction may be relevant for both pain and unpleasant touch, this does not equal that the same modulating system (e.g., endogenous opioid system) is used to influence the underlying processing to be more in accord with the predictions. \n\nOpioids play a prominent role in pain regulation. One of their main roles seems to be to engage the descending pain modulation system, which enables regulation of pain by inhibitory influence on early (spinal) nociceptive signaling ( ;  ). In addition, opioids supposedly exert their analgesic effects by acting on cerebral structures and thus possibly on more downstream consequences of the nociceptive signals ( ). Notably, anterior insula and aMCC are distinctly activated by opioids ( ;  ;  ) and have high opioid receptor concentration ( )\u2014making these regions not only key regions in processing pain and affective experience but also highly malleable to opioid regulation. Placebo analgesia acts via a number of cognitive and neural mechanisms that are not yet entirely understood. What seems clear though is that with respect to the neurochemical underpinnings, the opioid system plays a prominent role in placebo analgesia (see reviews;  ;  ;  ), but also other neurochemical mechanisms seem to be involved, such as the endocannabinoid system ( ). For instance, studies using opioid receptor imaging measured by positron emission tomography (PET) have consistently indicated that placebo analgesia involves increased opioid activity in anterior insula and aMCC ( ;  ;  ). Moreover, early evidence suggested that the blockade of opioidergic neurotransmission attenuated placebo analgesia ( ;  ), complemented by more recent findings directly indicating that brainstem and spinal mechanisms indeed are engaged in this blockade ( ). The core finding of our study is that blockade of the opioid system only affects pain and pain empathy but not unpleasant touch. It suggests that one of the hallmark features of pain, that is, the involvement of the endogenous opioid system, seems irrelevant for the first-hand experience of unpleasant touch and empathy for such touch (or, to be more conservative, much less relevant than for pain). Thus, domain general effects on affect processing cannot solely explain our previously shown effects of placebo analgesia on empathy for pain. This would also be in line with recent correlational PET evidence indicating increased opioidergic activity during the observation of pain in others ( ), and a recent study showing that naltrexone interferes with vicarious learning of pain ( ). Taken together, our study thus provides another important piece of information that empathy for pain engages similar neuro-cognitive mechanisms as the first-hand experience of pain. \n\nWhile the present study crucially expands the insights of previous work, the following limitations also require some attention and should be addressed in future studies. First, we did not counterbalance the order of the parts of the experiments involving pain and affective touch (see Methods). This arbitrary decision, which was motivated by our primary focus on the pain task and the cover-story (i.e., the study being about effects of a painkiller on brain activity during pain processing), could have been problematic if the effects either of the placebo analgesia or of the opioid blockade had been waning over time. However, it is unlikely that this was the case. Corollary analyses of pain and unpleasant touch ratings at the outset and the end of both tasks revealed similar degrees of placebo analgesia (see Supplemental Results R1.3). Naltrexone, on the other hand, shows receptor binding that by far outlasts the hour within which we performed both parts of the experiment ( ). \n\nSecond, one might argue that the intensity of pain and unpleasant touch were insufficiently matched, so that possible differences between domains could be explained, for example, by differences in salience ( ). However, this would only account for the similar effects found in the fMRI experiment, but not in the psychopharmacological experiment (which moreover showed similar overall ratings when comparing the groups that had undergone placebo analgesia). Moreover, the mean intensity of self-reported pain and touch were in a similar scale range (pain: 51% of maximum, unpleasant touch: 50.4%; pleasant touch: 57.4%). Finally, we only focused on opioidergic mechanisms and their role in placebo analgesia. Our study thus remains na\u00efve with respect to other neuro-chemical mechanisms that might explain how placebo analgesia affects unpleasant touch, calling for future research. For the same reason, we are not making any claims regarding the general role of the opioid system in affective touch processing. \n\nIn conclusion, this study adds to an extensive research line and a growing body of evidence aiming at a more mechanistic understanding of empathy. It shows that while domain-general effects can explain some aspects of previous findings related to unpleasant affect, there is specificity with respect to the opioidergic mechanism underlying pain and its empathic experience. Notwithstanding independent replication and extension, this suggests that the opioid system and thus a hallmark feature of pain regulation plays a specific role in empathy for pain, and its regulation. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8107785, "text_md5": "52604576b9e757a29de4387c40cd252f", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 161], "journal": [162, 174], "publication_year": [176, 180], "title": [191, 293], "keywords": [307, 349], "abstract": [362, 1562], "body": [1571, 62368]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 33454739, "doi": "10.1093/cercor/bhaa385", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8107785", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8107785"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8107785\">8107785</a>", "list_title": "PMC8107785  Beyond Sharing Unpleasant Affect\u2014Evidence for Pain-Specific Opioidergic Modulation of Empathy for Pain"}

Yet, findings from individual studies remain mixed. In the present quantitative functional neuroimaging meta-analysis, we summarized across 50 fMRI studies of social cognition to identify consistent differences in neural activation as a function of whether the target of social cognition was an in-group or out-group member. We investigated if such differences varied according to a specific social category (i.e. race) and specific social cognitive processes (i.e. empathy and emotion perception). We found that social cognition about in-group members was more reliably related to activity in brain regions associated with mentalizing (e.g. dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), whereas social cognition about out-group members was more reliably related to activity in regions associated with exogenous attention and salience (e.g. anterior insula). These findings replicated for studies specifically focused on the social category of race, and we further found intergroup differences in neural activation during empathy and emotion perception tasks. These results help shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying social cognition across group lines. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFrom an early age, humans tend to categorize ourselves and others as \u2018us versus them\u2019 ( ;  ). These categorizations can lead individuals to enact disparate behaviors toward in-group and out-group members. For example, individuals tend to behave in ways that favor in-group members (i.e. in-group favoritism) and disfavor out-group members ( ;  ;  ). Such is the case when White individuals assign less harsh legal punishments to White (  vs   Black) targets ( ) or grant more comprehensive medical care to White patients compared to patients of other races ( ;  ). Further, perceptions of out-groups as more homogenous than one\u2019s in-group (i.e. out-group homogeneity effect) can also influence social behavior in intergroup interactions ( ;  ;  ;  ). This can manifest in the individuals\u2019 tendency to be less discerning in their perception of emotional expressions of out-group members ( ), which may engender discriminatory behavior via stereotyping and prejudice ( ). \n\nIt is clear from this behavioral literature that social categorizations matter: the ways in which we think about one another vary depending on perceived in-group   vs   out-group status ( ). Further, these differences in in-group   vs   out-group social cognition can underlie biased social behaviors ( ;  ;  ). However, it is less clear \u2018how\u2019 exactly an individual\u2019s group membership sets into action the neural processes that may ultimately mediate biased behavior. \n\n### Neuroscience of intergroup social cognition \n  \nNeuroimaging approaches have been widely used over the past two decades to address this \u2018how\u2019 by examining the neural mechanisms that underlie social cognitive processes directed toward in-group   vs   out-group members. For instance, consistent with the in-group favoritism effect, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data reveal greater activity in the ventral striatum for in-group members ( ) and more amygdala activity for out-group members ( ;  ), suggesting that in-group members may be perceived as more valuable and/or rewarding and out-group members might be more uncertain, ambiguous or aversive. Moreover, consistent with an out-group homogeneity effect, greater activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) for in-group members ( ;  ) and less activity in dmPFC for out-group members ( ) further underscore the fact that people may more likely attribute unique and rich mental qualities to in-group compared to out-group members. \n\nHowever, inconsistencies in the literature also abound, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the neural mechanisms underlying intergroup social cognition. For instance, some neuroimaging studies reveal greater insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation to out-group members during emotion perception tasks ( ;  ), whereas others show greater activity in these regions during in-group emotion perception ( ;  ;  ;  ). Similarly, some studies in which group membership is based on race find greater amygdala activation in response to \u2018out-group\u2019 faces, which may reflect other-race negativity bias ( ;  ;  ). However, neuroimaging studies involving social categorization based on minimal groups (e.g. red team   vs   blue team) have demonstrated greater amygdala activation in response to \u2018in-group\u2019 members ( ). These results suggest that the specific type of social grouping under consideration (i.e. race   vs   minimal group) may influence the neural regions engaged during social cognition across group lines ( ;  ). These inconsistencies are further complicated by the fact that individual neuroimaging studies are more prone to Type I errors due to small sample sizes and insufficient statistical corrections ( ). \n\nSince past studies in this area assess diverse social categories (e.g. race and minimal groups) and social cognitive processes (e.g. empathy and emotion perception), it is important to identify the core neural mechanisms underlying in-group and out-group social cognition across the literature. This is particularly important in light of the fact that it is not possible to make inferences about generalized intergroup neural processes from single studies that only investigate one type of social group (e.g. race). Further, while some studies offer evidence of the neural regions involved in generalized social categorization ( ;  ), still relatively little is known about how the brain distinguishes between \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 more broadly. Meta-analysis is useful in this context because it allows us to identify the most reliable patterns of activation across several studies, regardless of the social category of distinction in any individual study. Further, this analytic tool overcomes the limitations associated with sample size, power and experimental design inherent in individual fMRI studies ( ;  ) to help reveal the functional neuroanatomy or \u2018neural reference space\u2019 consistently related to a process of interest (i.e. intergroup social cognition;  ). \n\nAdditionally, research needs to address how neural activity in intergroup contexts varies according to both the \u2018social category\u2019 assessed and \u2018social cognitive process\u2019 involved. Thus, we also aimed to use meta-analysis to identify how the neural mechanisms of intergroup social cognition may reliably vary as a function of a specific \u2018social category\u2019 (i.e. race) and two particular \u2018social cognitive processes\u2019 (i.e. empathy and emotion perception). We focused on \u2018race\u2019 as a key social category, given the importance of race-based bias in inter-race contexts ( ;  ) and the consequences of these behaviors on the health and well-being of marginalized racial group members ( ). Further, we focused on \u2018empathy\u2019 and \u2018emotion perception\u2019, given that these are two of the most studied processes in the intergroup social cognition fMRI literature ( ), and it is commonly argued that these social cognitive processes allow perceivers to represent the uniquely human experiences of group members that are important to intergroup relations ( ;  ). Investigating these in-group/out-group differences in the neural underpinnings of social cognition according to racial grouping and among the specific social cognitive processes of empathy and emotion perception will provide a more nuanced understanding of how group membership may shape behavior in intergroup contexts, especially in the case of race-based biases in social behavior. \n\n\n### The present study \n  \nIn sum, this meta-analysis addressed four primary questions: (i) Are a core set of brain regions reliably involved during social cognition across various \u2018social categories\u2019 and \u2018social cognitive processes\u2019? (ii) Do the neural correlates of in-group/out-group social cognition consistently differ when \u2018race\u2019 is the category on which the target\u2019s group membership is based? (iii) Does neural activation across in-group   vs   out-group consistently differ when \u2018empathy\u2019 and \u2018emotion perception\u2019 are the specific social cognitive processes engaged? (iv) Finally, within the specific social category of race, does neural activation consistently differ according to the specific social cognitive process engaged (i.e. empathy and emotion perception)? \n\nOur analysis expands upon a prior meta-analysis ( ) of \u223c30 studies which found that the amygdala, ACC, fusiform gyrus and right insula were reliably involved in distinguishing between in-group and out-group members generally. The current meta-analysis contains a total of 50 studies published through 2000\u20132018 and utilizes multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) as opposed to activation likelihood estimation technique used in  . Moreover, the present paper extends this prior work, which did not distinguish between a variety of social categories and types of social cognition, to examine the more specific neural correlates of intergroup social cognition for the social category of race and the specific social cognitive processes of empathy and emotion perception. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study selection and search strategy \n  \nFollowing Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards ( ), our search strategy first collected relevant papers from PubMed and PsycINFO. We searched for English-language publications of fMRI studies that examined processing of in-group/out-group human targets. The initial search terms used were \u2018fMRI\u2009+\u2009in-group\u2009+\u2009out-group\u2019 and \u2018fMRI\u2009+\u2009group membership\u2019. We also used these terms in conjunction with various social categories to capture as many different in-group/out-groups as possible (see  ). \n\nTitles and abstracts of papers from these searches were reviewed to eliminate any clearly irrelevant studies or duplicates. The initial searches also resulted in several narrative review papers, which we mined for additional papers but excluded from the database of studies. Next, we completed full-text screening to eliminate studies that did not meet the following criteria: (i) participants were healthy, non-medicated adults; (ii) used fMRI to measure BOLD signal as an index of neural activity; (iii) coordinates of activation for contrasts were reported in either Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach space and (iv) reported contrasts that directly compared processing of distinguishable in-group   vs   out-group (or vice versa) targets. We included both contrasts involving explicit processing of in-group/out-group distinctions (e.g. categorization of stimuli by group membership) and contrasts involving implicit processing of these distinctions (i.e. passive viewing of stimuli representing group membership). Coordinates for both region-of-interest and whole-brain analyses were included, consistent with prior MKDA approaches ( ;  ,  ;  ). These inclusion criteria resulted in a total of 50 papers in the final database, which together yielded 116 contrasts. See   for PRISMA diagram and   for characteristics of the included studies.\n \n  \nPRISMA diagram summarizing the literature search and study screening, eligibility and inclusion process. \n  \n\n### Data collection \n  \nData extraction was completed by two coders (i.e. the first and third authors), with each coder reviewing all articles separately. Thus, all studies were double-coded and cross-checked to identify discrepancies. If discrepancies were noted, both coders reviewed the article again to determine the accurate data to report. Each article was coded for the following elements: sample size, social cognitive process, stimuli (e.g. still face images and videos), social group (e.g. race, culture, gender and minimal), relational status of the target and reference (i.e. in-group or out-group), and coordinates of peak activation. \n\n\n\n## Data analysis \n  \nMKDA (see   for more information) was implemented through the Matlab toolbox NeuroElf ( ). Consistent with MKDA and neuroimaging meta-analytic procedures ( ;  ;  ), contrast coordinates in Talairach space were first converted to MNI space and then convolved using a smoothing kernel of 12\u2009mm, ultimately producing binary indicator contrast maps. Weights were placed on each study based on the square root of the sample size and whether the study used fixed or random effects. Fixed-effect studies were down-weighted by 0.75 to reduce the influence of those studies. By weighting studies in this manner, MKDA allows for higher-quality (i.e. higher powered and more generalizable) studies to have greater impact on the meta-analytic results ( ). The weighted averages of the kernels across individual study contrasts were used to produce contrast maps based on the proportion of activation near a given voxel from   N   contrasts. This proportion is thresholded by comparing it to a null distribution created through Monte Carlo simulations (5000 samples) that compute the likelihood of finding any activation in any voxel within gray matter (excluding white matter). For all analyses, we set this a priori threshold to a stringent height-based threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 (family-wise error-corrected for multiple comparisons) to determine whether voxels were significant. Results thus represent the neural regions displaying the most consistent activation for a given contrast (i.e. \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019) when averaged across all studies. \n\nFirst, we investigated the neural reference space of brain regions consistently activated during \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 and \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 contrasts across all study-level contrasts. Identifying these neural reference spaces allowed us to determine the core set of brain regions consistently associated with in-group   vs   out-group social cognition across the literature, regardless of the social cognitive process or group category studied. To supplement these primary contrasts, we also conducted meta-analytic contrasts in which we contrasted both of the aforementioned sets of contrasts against each other as follows:\n[(\u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019) > (\u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019)] and [(\u2018\u2009>\u2009in-group) > (in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019)]. These meta-analytic contrasts allowed us to determine which clusters of activation were relatively more consistent for \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 contrasts relative to \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 contrasts and vice versa. \n\nSecond, we examined the neural correlates of social cognition specifically for contrasts in which race was the social category of distinction. To do so, we investigated the neural reference space for each \u2018racial in-group\u2009>\u2009racial out-group\u2019 and \u2018racial out-group\u2009>\u2009racial in-group\u2019 contrast. Again, we supplemented these primary contrasts with meta-analytic contrasts, [(\u2018racial in-group\u2009>\u2009racial out-group\u2019) > (\u2018racial out-group\u2009>\u2009racial in-group\u2019)], to determine the relative specificity of activation for each contrast. \n\nThird, we examined how consistent differences in neural activation might differ based on the specific social cognitive process engaged. Thus, we investigated the neural reference space for \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 and \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 by specific social cognitive process. We focus in the main text on empathy and emotion perception, given their prevalence in the literature and importance for predicting biases in behavior ( ;  ;  ). Results for other social cognitive processes are presented in  . \n\nFinally, we examined the neural reference spaces for specific social cognitive processes (i.e. empathy and emotion perception) specifically within race-based contrasts. Results for other types of social cognition within race-specific contrasts are presented in  . \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Overall differences in functional activation for in-group   vs   out-group \n  \nWe first identified the neural reference space of regions more consistently activated for \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019, irrespective of task or social group (515/520 points; 115/116 contrasts). This analysis revealed consistent activity in the bilateral anterior insula, including a left anterior insula cluster (\u221236, 15, 10;   k  \u2009=\u2009260) that extended into the claustrum and a right anterior insula cluster (43, 20, 8;   k  \u2009=\u2009260) that extended into the right inferior frontal gyrus (iFG) and right precentral gyrus. A third cluster was centered in the right dmPFC (8, 47, 27;   k  \u2009=\u2009260), extending into the superior frontal gyrus. \n\nNext, we examined the neural reference space of regions more consistently activated for \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019, irrespective of task or social group (515/520 points; 115/116 contrasts). Here, we observed one significant cluster of activity, with its peak in the right anterior insula (33, 12, 13;   k  \u2009=\u20093060), extending into the right iFG and precentral gyrus. Thus, both the \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 and \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 contrasts revealed similar, but distinct, peaks in the anterior insula (see   and  ). \n  \nCoordinates for overall differences in functional activation for in-group   vs   out-group \n  \n Notes  : Brodmann\u2009=\u2009Brodmann area;   x  ,   y  ,   z  \u2009=\u2009coordinates in MNI space;   k  \u2009=\u2009cluster size in mm ; max\u2009=\u2009maximum value within a cluster; mean\u2009=\u2009average value within a cluster; LH\u2009=\u2009left hemisphere; RH\u2009=\u2009right hemisphere.

There were no clusters consistently activated across studies at the   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 threshold for \u2018racial in-group\u2009>\u2009racial out-group\u2019. However, \u2018racial out-group\u2009>\u2009racial in-group\u2019 (358/520 points; 80/116 contrasts) revealed two significant clusters of activity: one in left middle frontal gyrus (mFG; 0, 9, 44;   k  \u2009=\u2009119), which extended into the mid-cingulate cortex (MCC), and one cluster in right anterior insula (40, 20, 13;   k  \u2009=\u2009123), which extended into the claustrum and iFG (see   and  ). \n  \nCoordinates for overall differences in functional activation for racial in-group   vs   out-group \n  \n Notes  : Brodmann\u2009=\u2009Brodmann area;   x  ,   y  ,   z  \u2009=\u2009coordinates in MNI space;   k  \u2009=\u2009cluster size in mm ; max\u2009=\u2009maximum value within cluster; mean\u2009=\u2009average value within cluster; LH\u2009=\u2009left hemisphere; R\u2009=\u2009right hemisphere.

For written and tabular results for contrasts of other social cognitive processes, see   Results and  . \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Overall differences in functional activation for in-group   vs   out-group \n  \nIn this meta-analysis, we examined the consistency and specificity of neural activation during intergroup social cognition. Results confirmed that there are consistent differences in neural activation during social cognition corresponding to whether the target of such cognition is an in-group   vs   out-group member. Across studies that engaged a variety of social cognitive processes and defined group membership based on diverse social categories, we found more consistent activation in prefrontal cortical regions including the right iFG, precentral gyrus and dmPFC when social cognition was directed at in-group (  vs   out-group) members. Moreover, meta-analytic contrasts indicated that the dmPFC was more consistently activated across study contrasts of \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 compared to \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 social cognition. Interestingly, the anterior insula was part of the neural reference space for social cognition regardless of whether the target of social cognition was an in-group or out-group member. However, subsequent meta-analytic contrasts revealed that although the anterior insula was consistently active across both \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 and \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 contrasts, this region was \u2018more consistently\u2019 activated for \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 social cognitive processing relative to \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 across studies. \n\nOur overall in-group   vs   out-group findings offer some insight into neurocognitive processes that may underlie intergroup social behavior. For example, more consistent dmPFC activation during in-group (  vs   out-group) social cognition aligns with behavioral theories, suggesting that individuals are more likely to assign mental states to and act prosocially toward in-group compared to out-group members ( ;  ;  ), as dmPFC activity has been consistently associated with the ability to infer mental states of others ( ;  ;  ) and has been implicated in prosocial behavior ( ;  ). Further, research shows that the ability to simulate the minds of others tends to lead to greater prosocial behavior ( ). Notably, this consistent dmPFC activation for in-group relative to out-group members may seem surprising in light of existing literature suggesting a ventral\u2013dorsal gradient in the mPFC, with the dmPFC implicated in social cognitive processing of dissimilar (e.g. out-group) others and the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) implicated in processing of similar (e.g. in-group) others ( ;  ). However, other studies have offered evidence that such ventral\u2013dorsal distinctions of the mPFC maybe be task-dependent (see   for a review). Although the present analyses were not specifically intended to test the presence of a ventral\u2013dorsal gradient in the mPFC, our results raise further questions about whether this gradient observed for some tasks generalizes across social cognition more broadly. As such, future work should explore this question more directly. Nevertheless, findings of the present study appear consistent with the notion that individuals are more likely to engage in mentalizing for in-group (  vs   out-group) members and that doing so may promote greater prosocial behavior ( ;  ), thus offering a potential neural mechanism underlying in-group favoritism. \n\nOur finding of more consistent anterior insula activation during out-group social cognition also offers insight into the neural mechanisms that may underly out-group biases identified in the behavioral literature. Existing meta-analytic evidence suggests two major functional\u2013anatomic subregions within the anterior insula: the ventral region, shown to be more active during visceral and affective experiences (especially subjective arousal), and the dorsal region, which is more associated with exogenous attention, including salience detection, attention orientation and task performance monitoring ( ;  ,  ,  ). Given these distinctions, one interpretation of the present findings is that out-group social cognition demands more attentional resources relative to in-group social cognition, perhaps because out-group members are more unfamiliar, infrequent or novel. This interpretation also corresponds with previous functional connectivity analyses that have shown evidence of anterior insula laterality during orientating/arousal and tasks requiring cognitive control. Specifically, right anterior insula has shown stronger connectivity with regions implicated in attentional orientation and arousal (e.g. postcentral gyrus and supramarginal gyrus), while left anterior insula shows stronger connectivity with regions implicated in perspective taking and cognitive motor control (e.g. dmPFC and superior frontal gyrus;  ). Along these lines, the right lateralization of anterior insula for out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group processing may reflect recruitment of attentional resources that results in focus on an individual\u2019s salient out-group status, rather than individuating processes associated with greater medial prefrontal activation. On the other hand, the left lateralization of the anterior insula during in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group processing may facilitate communication with regions involved in perspective taking and mentalizing processes that allow for more individuated perceptions of in-group members. However, such interpretations are made cautiously given evidence, suggesting that functional lateralization of the anterior insula may vary with age, gender and other individual differences, and we were unable to account for these differences in the current analyses ( ;  ). \n\nInterestingly, the \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 anterior insula findings also align with recent neuroimaging work showing that the right anterior insula is involved in integrating information about how others relate to one another in the service of making social group inferences ( ). For instance, in  , predictions about allyship among group members based on latent structure learning of social group coalitions were related to greater activation of the right anterior insula, compared to when predictions of allyship were based solely on similarity between targets. As such, the consistent anterior insula activation observed in our \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 contrasts may suggest that, when considering out-group members, people engage in an additional layer of processing that incorporates how members of that out-group relate to other groups but do not engage in this same degree of processing when thinking about in-group members. \n\n\n### Differences in functional activation for racial in-group   vs   racial out-group \n  \nWe also investigated whether there are consistent neural differences in intergroup social cognition specifically within the social category of race. Interestingly, we did not find any regions consistently activated during racial in-group (  vs   out-group) social cognition. However, racial out-group (  vs   in-group) social cognitive processing was associated with more frequent activation of the mFG. We also found consistent anterior insula activation during racial out-group (  vs   in-group) social cognitive processing, mirroring the pattern of activation observed in the overall contrasts (i.e. \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019). A subsequent meta-analytic contrast comparing [(\u2018racial out-group\u2009>\u2009racial in-group\u2019)\u2009>\u2009(\u2018racial in-group\u2009>\u2009racial out-group\u2019)] revealed a significant cluster of activation in the right anterior insula that also closely mirrored the findings of the overall [(\u2018out-group in-group\u2019)\u2009>\u2009(\u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019)] meta-analytic contrast, suggesting that the swathe of activation in this region may be associated with out-group processing in general, rather than being specific to racial out-group processing. Alternatively, this finding could be attributable to race being the most frequently investigated social category in the current literature, thus causing race-specific findings to drive an overall meta-analytic effect. \n\nOur failure to identify consistent activation during racial in-group social cognition is interesting and suggests that there is heterogeneity in the brain areas underlying social cognition for racial in-group members across the literature. There were 80 contrasts in our database that addressed this particular question, so our failure to find consistent activation is not likely due to a lack of power. Indeed, a review of the individual contrast maps that contributed to these results revealed that the clusters of activation from individual studies were spatially heterogeneous, suggesting that the null results of these contrasts are driven by true variability in the data rather than due to lack of power. As such, one interpretation of these results is that social cognition for racial in-group members may be so routine that it does not preferentially activate brain regions above and beyond those activated for racial out-group members. In contrast, we did find that social cognitive processing directed at racial out-group individuals consistently elicits increased activity in regions implicated in exogenous attention and salience (e.g. anterior insula, mFG and iFG), mirroring findings for out-group members more generally and suggesting some consistency in regions involved in racial out-group social cognition across the literature. \n\n\n### Differences in functional activation for overall in-group   vs   out-group and racial in-group   vs   out-group by social cognitive process \n  \nFinally, we explored how functional activation during intergroup processing may vary depending on the social cognitive process engaged, focusing specifically on empathy and emotion perception. We found empathy directed at in-group members was associated with more consistent activation in the dmPFC, even when focused specifically on racial in-group (  vs   out-group) empathy. Among racial in-group (  vs   out-group) empathy contrasts, we also observed a significant cluster of activation centered on the anterior insula. This cluster was more dorsal, which, in following with the ventral\u2013dorsal distinctions of anterior insula functionality ( ;  ), suggests that empathy for in-group members may be more salient or elicit stronger attentional control (compared to out-group). However, these findings are difficult to interpret considering that our earlier results indicated that the anterior insula was more consistently activated in response to out-group members when we collapsed contrasts across all social cognition tasks. Still, this empathy-specific finding might suggest that in-group/out-group differences in activation of the dorsal anterior insula depend on the particular social cognitive process engaged. Conversely, empathy directed at out-group members was consistently associated with activity in motor (e.g. premotor cortex and precentral gyrus) and executive function areas (e.g. dlPFC and mFG) of the prefrontal cortex, perhaps suggesting that more effortful cognitive control is necessary to engage in empathy for out-group members. \n\nWe also observed differences in neural activation in response to racial in-group   vs   out-group members (although not to in-group   vs   out-group members in general) during emotion perception tasks. Specifically, perceiving emotions of racial in-group members was associated with activation in the amygdala and fusiform, regions that have been well-established in visual emotion perception ( ;  ;  ), while emotion perception directed at racial out-group members was related to consistent anterior insula activation. Interestingly, this cluster was relatively more ventral than those observed in other out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group contrasts. One interpretation of this finding is that it may reflect greater aversive affective responding on the part of perceivers ( ,  ), as perceivers may find emotional racial out-group members to be aversive. Again, these findings related to the activation of the anterior insula in these empathy and emotion perception contrasts remain difficult to interpret and warrant future studies to better understand how the ventral\u2013dorsal anterior insula is operating in in-group   vs   out-group empathy and emotion perception. Nonetheless, these task-specific findings ultimately indicate that the neural correlates of intergroup social cognition do indeed vary depending on the specific social cognitive process engaged. This variation appears to be especially true for affective tasks like empathy and emotion perception, which would explain the inconsistencies noted in the literature regarding insula and dACC activity during in-group   vs   out-group social cognitive processing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nThis work has some limitations. Data were constrained to published fMRI studies; therefore, it is unclear how the present results may be affected by publication bias. Moreover, the race-specific contrasts do not address how neural responding may vary depending on the specific racial groups involved (e.g. Black   vs   White and Asian   vs   Black). Distinguishing among various types of cross-race dyads is an important future direction, as different dynamics (e.g. cultural stereotypes and intergroup histories) exist for different racial/ethnic group pairings. Furthermore, due to a limited number of eligible studies, we were unable to assess in-group   vs   out-group differences in neural activation across all types of social cognition and social categories, thus leaving unanswered questions about other notable social cognitive processes such as theory of mind and perceptions of trustworthiness. \n\nFinally, while our results may offer insight into neural mechanisms underlying intergroup social behaviors, they are subject to important caveats inherent in any neuroimaging meta-analysis. First, coordinate-based neuroimaging meta-analyses are the gold standard when aggregating across the neuroimaging literature; yet, these techniques rely on functional coordinates derived from contrast analyses but do not incorporate coordinates derived from correlational or functional connectivity analyses, thus limiting the kinds of studies that can be included in the database. Nonetheless, this meta-analysis helps reveal which regions are most consistently active for different social cognitive processes and targets, which may in turn prove useful for future studies using more advanced techniques such as functional connectivity. Second, interpretation of meta-analytic neuroimaging data is subject to reverse inference\u2014inferring cognitive processes from the presence of neural activation ( ). Future studies should follow up on these interpretations using experimental designs that pinpoint brain\u2013behavior links. Finally, our findings do not provide evidence of a causal link between neural activation and subsequent behavior in intergroup contexts. Future research might explore how inducing neural activity in the regions identified here may impact individuals\u2019 behaviors when directed at in-group   vs   out-group members. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe conducted the largest meta-analysis to date of the fMRI literature examining the neural correlates of social cognition across group lines. Our findings align with existing behavioral data and theories on intergroup social phenomena (e.g. in-group favoritism and out-group degradation) and help clarify how the brain gives rise to diverse social cognitive processes, which in turn may manifest as biased social behaviors in intergroup contexts. We hope this work can help guide future research and interventions that address intergroup behavioral dynamics. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8421705, "text_md5": "112310c524b3950dba9ea0643970cdca", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 116], "journal": [117, 141], "publication_year": [143, 147], "title": [158, 236], "keywords": [250, 307], "abstract": [320, 1739], "body": [1748, 41812]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 33760100, "doi": "10.1093/scan/nsab034", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8421705", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8421705"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8421705\">8421705</a>", "list_title": "PMC8421705  The neural underpinnings of intergroup social cognition: an fMRI meta-analysis"}

To address this issue, the present study focuses on sex differences and investigates whether resting state fMRI is stable in men and women or changes within relative short-term periods (i.e., across the menstrual cycle). Due to the fact that we recently reported menstrual cycle effects on cognitive control based on data collected during the same sessions, the current study is particularly interested in fronto-parietal resting state networks. Resting state fMRI was measured in sixteen women during three different cycle phases (menstrual, follicular, and luteal). Fifteen men underwent three sessions in corresponding time intervals. We used independent component analysis to identify four fronto-parietal networks. The results showed sex differences in two of these networks with women exhibiting higher functional connectivity in general, including the prefrontal cortex. Menstrual cycle effects on resting states were non-existent. It is concluded that sex differences in resting state fMRI might reflect sexual dimorphisms in the brain rather than transitory activating effects of sex hormones on the functional connectivity in the resting brain. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSex differences in the brain have been shown on the structural, functional, and behavioral level, and partly reflect the sex-hormonal organization of the brain during early ontogenesis  ,  . Several studies suggest sex differences in functional brain organization. For example, it is widely assumed that women are generally more bilaterally organized than men  \u2013 ,  ,  ,  . Furthermore, women show more prefrontal involvement during cognitive control tasks  ,  , however, not consistently  . Similarly, such sex differences along the anterior-posterior axis has been shown for visuospatial tasks, where women show higher prefrontal involvement  \u2013 , while men sometimes exhibit a stronger activation in parietal  ,   or primary sensory   regions. Sex differences in performance of visuospatial abilities can also partly be accounted for by differences in working memory capacity  . \n\nCognitively demanding tasks typically activate a fronto-parietal network as assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  . Frontal regions are particularly associated with top down control and goal directed behavior  , and parietal regions with sensory integration and attention  . Prefrontal and lateral parietal areas are connected through the longitudinal fasciculus, and the activity in this network has been associated with attentional control and working memory load  . The fronto-parietal cortical network can be observed bilaterally independent of stimulus modality  , or lateralized to the left and right hemispheres depending on the respectively verbal and visuospatial nature of the task  \u2013 . \n\nTask-related fMRI has been the traditional method of studying functional brain networks. However, recent years of research has established that the various sensory, motor, and cognitive networks can also be studied during rest with resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Activity of distributed cortical areas engaged in the same network oscillate in phase on a low frequency range (<0.1 Hz) also during rest. This allows identifying and separating individual networks through temporal correlation techniques  ,  . Applying this approach also allows to identify the fronto-parietal control network  \u2013 . Frequently referred to as the task positive network, it has been suggested to be equivalent to the fronto-parietal network involved during tasks, and also has been shown to reorganize in response to a working memory task  . \n\nA number of recent studies have addressed sex differences in rs-fMRI. While one study did not detect any sex differences in default mode, salience, and (fronto-parietal) cognitive control network  , other studies found sex differences in various sensory, motor, sub-cortical, or cognitive networks such as default mode, cognitive control, and language networks  ,  ,  \u2013 . Filippi et al.   suggest, however, that sex differences are more evident within cognitive rather than sensory networks. Several of the above mentioned studies find women to have higher connectivity in prefrontal regions relative to men  ,  , including for fronto-parietal networks  . However, Allen et al.   and Weissman-Fogel et al.   suggest no sex differences in fronto-parietal networks. A few studies also investigated sex differences in the laterality of resting state networks with conflicting results. Whereas Liu   found men to be more lateralized in both left and right lateralized systems, Filippi   report women to be more lateralized in default mode and attention networks. Applying graph theoretical approaches, Tomasi and Volkow  , and Tian   found that women show higher functional connectivity in the left hemisphere, while men are more right lateralized. This also includes prefrontal regions. The consistency across findings is thereby low, and the diversity of methods and networks explored challenges the comparability across studies and groups of participants. \n\nAs implied by the terminology, rs-fMRI can dichotomously be referred to as the counterpart of the mind-state engaged during task execution (task-related fMRI). However, because of the unconstrained nature of resting state, there is also an on-going discussion of the degree of stability/variability in resting state. In other words, it is unclear to what extent rs-fMRI can be considered as a trait measure of a person rooted in underlying structural characteristics or more dependent on the current mind state of the person being tested. Evidence for the first view comes from studies that revealed a link between resting state functional connectivity and white matter pathways in the brain, including the fronto-parietal network  ,  . Further, test-retest reliability in resting state appears to be medium  \u2013  to high  \u2013 , depending on methods and networks studied, which confirms a certain degree of stability across measurements, but also leaves 20\u201350% of variability unexplained. Arguments for state dependency comes from a range of studies suggesting rs-fMRI to be influenced by a number of variables such as task execution prior to rs-fMRI  , time of day  , or mood  . \n\nWith respect to sex differences in resting state, studies seem to imply that they are a result of fixed and invariant sex differences in structural and functional connectivity, and therefore being a trait characteristic of the male and female brain. However, other studies have shown that the functional connectivity during task performance can change dynamically, for example with the hormonal state of female participants (e.g. menstrual cycle phase). Specifically, it has been shown that sex hormones change dynamically the functional cerebral organization by modulating hemispheric asymmetries and interhemispheric interaction across the menstrual cycle. Women tested behaviourally in the follicular and/or luteal phase, with respectively high levels of estradiol and/or estradiol and progesterone, are less lateralized as compared to the menstrual phase  \u2013 , and also show reduced functional connectivity between hemispheres  \u2013 . In addition, estradiol appears to modulate cognitive control as assessed by cognitive inhibition  ,   and working memory tasks  \u2013 . One of these studies   also showed that this estradiol-related modulation occurred in prefrontal and parietal regions. It should be highlighted that participants of the current cohort (data collected during the same sessions) showed an estradiol-related increase in cognitive control in the follicular phase as compared to menstrual and luteal phase  . Whether this estradiol effect is only task-related, or relies on changes in the intrinsic functional connectivity during resting state, is yet to be investigated. \n\nThe present study focuses on trait versus state aspects of sex and sex-hormonal differences in intrinsic functional connectivity in fronto-parietal networks. The fronto-parietal networks are particularly interesting due to potential sex differences in functional brain organization related to these networks, and menstrual cycle effects found previously in a cognitive control task for the current cohort (see above). Thus, the aim of the present study is twofold. First, we aim to investigate sex differences in rs-fMRI across three sessions, while controlling for sex-hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle in women. According to previous resting state studies on cognitive control networks in general  ,  ,  , and fronto-parietal networks in particular  , it is expected that women will show higher prefrontal connectivity as compared to men. Based on task-related fMRI studies  ,  ,   showing men to be more lateralized than women, we also expect similar sex differences in rs-fMRI networks. Second, the current study aims to investigate whether resting state connectivity changes dynamically within short-term periods across the menstrual cycle. In line with the previously reported increase in cognitive control in follicular women of the same cohort  , we predict estradiol-related changes in the prefrontal resting state connectivity in the follicular phase as compared to menstrual and luteal phase, whereas rs-fMRI is predicted to be more stable across corresponding time intervals in men. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Ethics statement \n  \nThe study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics (REK vest) at the University of Bergen. Participants gave their written informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were financially compensated for their participation. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nSixteen healthy women (out of twenty-one originally tested, see below for inclusion criteria) (mean \u00b1 SD: 23.25\u00b15.01 years) and fifteen healthy men (23.13\u00b12.42 years) completed three sessions of resting state fMRI. The sex of the participants was ascertained by self-report. All participants were native Norwegian speakers, and right handed (laterality quotient 93.33\u00b111.16 for women and 93.78\u00b110.23 for men)  . The women were tested once in three different cycle phases, i.e. the menstrual phase (day 2\u20134), the follicular phase (day 8\u201312), and the luteal phase (day 20\u201322). To estimate womens' cycle phases, individual length of the menstrual cycle was taken into account. Individual cycle length was calculated as an average of three consecutive cycles. Some women had used period calendars for several months before taking part in our study. The remaining women were followed for 3\u20134 months before the MRI scan. To estimate individual cycle phases, the back-counting method was applied. Self-reported onset of menses was used as a starting point. From this date, and by considering individual cycle length, the next menstruation-onset could be predicted. By counting back from this anticipated start of the next cycle, occurrence of the follicular and luteal phase could be predicted (e.g. for a 28-days cycle, this means counting back 17\u201321, and 7\u20139 days to capture follicular and luteal phase, respectively). Additional inclusion criteria for women involved a regular menstrual cycle with a mean cycle length of 26\u201332 days; no use of hormonal contraceptives or other hormone regulating medicaments currently or for the last six months; no pregnancy for the last six months prior to the study. To control for influence of circadian rhythm, time of testing deviated no more than three hours between testing sessions. To control for a possible session effect, women were randomized according to cycle phase at the first session (i.e. one third of the female sample started in each of the respective cycle phases. Men were tested three times with one to two weeks in between two testing sessions, and thereafter assigned into three groups equivalent to the female cycle phase groups. In addition to the resting state, a lexical decision task and a left-right confusion task was administered. The order of the three functional scans was randomized across subjects and sessions. \n\n\n### Hormone assays \n  \nTwo saliva samples were collected during each session for all participants, one before the resting state fMRI scan, and one after. An independent hormone laboratory completed the saliva analysis by applying luminescence assays on an average amount of the two samples. Analysis was done for concentration of estradiol and progesterone. \n\nSixteen women were included for subsequent statistical analysis. Luteal progesterone levels served as an indicator of ovulation in all women, which again served as basis for inclusion. Estradiol and progesterone levels were within the expected range for the respective cycle phases (see  ). A repeated measures ANOVA was done on progesterone levels and revealed a significant effect of cycle phase (F(2,30)\u200a=\u200a37.8, p<0.001, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.72). Fishers LSD post-hoc test showed a significant differences between the menstrual and luteal phase (p<0.001), and between the follicular and luteal phase (p<0.001). The same ANOVA on estradiol levels also revealed a cycle phase effect (F(2,30)\u200a=\u200a6.48, p\u200a=\u200a0.004, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.3). Fishers LSD post-hoc analysis revealed a significant difference between the menstrual and luteal phase (p\u200a=\u200a0.001), while the difference between the follicular and luteal phase marginally failed to reach statistical significance (p\u200a=\u200a0.06). Of the remaining sixteen women, six started testing in their menstrual phase, five in their follicular phase, and five in their luteal phase. Estradiol and progesterone levels of men were not tested because these two gonadal steroid hormones are known to be very low, and close to the detection limit of the hormone assays. \n   Means, standard deviations, and range (in brackets) in estradiol and progesterone levels from saliva samples in the women (n\u200a=\u200a16) during the menstrual, follicular and luteal cycle phase.      \n\n### Resting state fMRI \n  \nThe participants completed three sessions of rs-fMRI. They were instructed to relax and keep their eyes closed during scanning. The data were collected with a 3T GE-Signa MRI scanner. An anatomical T1-weighted image was acquired prior to the fMRI for each subject at each session (3DT1 FSPGR, TR/TE/FA/FOV 7.9 ms/3.2 ms/11\u00b0/256 mm, 256\u00d7256 scan matrix, 180 sagittal slices, voxel size 1\u00d71\u00d71 mm). For the functional images a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) sequence was used. 150 images were collected for each session with whole brain coverage (TR/TE/FA/FOV 2800 ms/30 ms/90\u00b0/128 mm, 128\u00d7128 matrix, 35 axial slices, voxel size 1.72\u00d71.72\u00d73.5 mm). \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nThe first three scans were treated as dummy scans and were rejected in the subsequent analysis. Prior to the statistical analysis the data went through pre-processing in SPM8 software (Welcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging,  ) implemented in Matlab R2009a (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA,  ). Preprocessing involved the steps realignment (reference volume: the first EPI volume obtained), and unwarping, normalization of the anatomy (template image provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)), resampling with a voxel size of 4\u00d74\u00d74 mm, and smoothing (FWHM 8 mm). \n\nGIFT   was used for a group level Independent Component Analysis (ICA). In a first preprocessing step, the individual data was mean corrected, by subtracting the image mean per time-point. Thereafter, following the GIFT default settings, three analysis steps were applied. First, the data went through a data reduction step using principal component analysis (PCA). This was done separately for each participant to reduce individual data dimensionality. Afterwards the individual data were group-concatenated and then subjected to another two PCA data reduction steps. Second, the reduced data were used for estimation of forty independent components using the infomax algorithm. The third step involved back-reconstruction, using GICA, of individual spatial maps from the components estimated at group level. The values of each participant's maps and time courses were scaled to represent percent signal change. No temporal filtering was applied on the data in GIFT. \n\nSpatial sorting was used to identify fronto-parietal networks among the forty components. The degree in which these networks are lateralized varies in the resting state literature  ,  . However, we chose to construct the sorting templates in line with Corbetta et al.   who distinguishes between left and right networks, and networks of more dorsal and ventral localization. Thereby the components were consecutively spatially sorted after four templates, and only the component with the highest concordance with the respective templates was selected for the subsequent group statistic. The four templates comprised the following regions: for dorsal networks (left or right) inferior parietal lobe (IPL), superior parietal lobe (SPL), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and precentral gyrus (PCG); for ventral networks (left or right) supramarginal gyrus (SMG), superior temporal gyrus (STG), MFG, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) triangularis and operculum  . This procedure resulted in four spatially distinct networks (see  ). The dorsal networks were clearly lateralized and correlated with left (r\u200a=\u200a0.40), and right dorsal templates (r\u200a=\u200a0.33). The two ventral networks were bilaterally organized. One of these two ventral networks correlated strongest with left ventral template (r\u200a=\u200a0.31), while the other one was identified as the anterior fronto-parietal network and correlated strongest with right ventral template (r\u200a=\u200a0.23). Corresponding individual spatial maps for each component were then further explored in terms of sex and menstrual cycle phase effects, using SPM8 second level statistics. In the following, these four networks will be referred to as the left dorsal, right dorsal, ventral, and anterior network. \n   Spatial maps of independent components.  \nDepicted in left, medial and right view are the four independent components selected for further statistical analysis: left dorsal; ventral; right dorsal; anterior network. \n  \nGroup analyses of the spatial maps for each of the four components were estimated using the individual back-reconstructed ICs. This allowed to investigate whether the connectivity amplitude between the networks of the components and overall brain regions (including hypothesized regions) vary according to sex or cycle phase. As the whole brain is represented in the spatial maps, the analysis estimates statistical parameter maps both for voxels within the core region of the network (component) as well as for voxels in distant, no-core regions. For each component two types of analysis were carried out. First, a 2 (Sex) \u00d73 (Cycle Phase) ANOVA using the full factorial design setup, implementing the factors Sex (levels specified as being independent and unequal in variance) and Cycle Phase (levels specified as dependent with equal variance). Total brain volume was implemented as a covariate to control for differences in brain size between men and women. Estimates of individual brain volume were calculated from tissue probability maps in subject space, generated from each individual's structural T1 image using unified segmentation and normalization routines in SPM8. These maps were multiplied by the volume per voxel, summed across the entire imaged volume and between relevant tissue classes to obtain a final estimate of brain volume. To assure that movement does not affect the results, the individual realignment parameters were characterized by calculating four estimates of movement according to Van Dijk et al.  . The estimates were mean translation, maximum translation, total translation, and mean rotation  . Mean translation and mean rotation were also included as regressors in the ANOVAs. The results were explored at a significance threshold of p<0.00025, adjusted for multiple testing, and a cluster threshold of minimum 10 contiguous voxels. The F-contrasts from these ANOVAs were also subjected to effect size analyses using the ImCalc function in SPM8. Effect size measures were expressed as \u03c9 \u200a=\u200a(f /(1+f )), with f \u200a=\u200a((df *(F \u22121))/n ) (in which the abbreviations refer to degrees of freedom numerator; empirical; observations). Results from these analyses are found in (  and  ). Second, to explore the data further, a multiple regression for each of the cycle phases including the regressors estradiol, progesterone, and the interaction of estradiol and progesterone. The multiple regression results were explored at a significance threshold of p<0.001 and a cluster threshold of minimum 10 contiguous voxels. The less conservative statistical threshold was chosen to increase statistical power, in particular with regard to potential sex hormonal effects across cycle phases. The corresponding statistical maps were explored with MRIcron ( , version 6/2013 \n\nTo specifically quantify test-retest reliability, we calculated an intraclass correlation (ICC) analysis on the individually back-reconstructed spatial maps from the group ICA for each component separately for men and women  . The ICC analysis was done voxel-wise, and estimates the difference of within-subject variability across the three sessions per subject (MSW), and between-subject variability (MSB). Thus, the ICC represents the proportion of total variance within the data that is explained by the variance between the testing sessions: ICC\u200a=\u200a(MSB\u2212MSW)/(MSB+2MSW). ICC ranges from 0\u20131, and the closer one approaches 1 the more is the observed variance explained by the between-subject variance rather than within-subject variance, indicating a higher test-retest reliability for the given sample of subjects. \n\nTo estimate the size of menstrual cycle effects detectable within the current sample size, an a posteriori power analysis was conducted (G*Power 3.1.3.:  ). Also, regional differences in gray matter were explored a posteriori, using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Therefore, the T1 weighted images were segmented into gray- and white-matter maps and corrected for the effect of the spatial normalization (modulated maps). The normalized unmodulated maps were implemented in a 2 (Sex) \u00d73 (Cycle Phase) ANOVA as the aim was to explore gray matter regional sex-differences in particular. Corresponding significance threshold as for the multiple regressions (see above) was applied. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe 2 (Sex) \u00d73 (Cycle Phase) ANOVAs revealed main effects of Sex in the right dorsal, and the anterior network. No sex difference was found in the left dorsal or ventral network. For the right dorsal network women showed higher connectivity in left cerebellum. For the anterior network, women showed higher functional connectivity in left MFG, bilateral precuneus, as well as right IPL (see  ,  ). No main effect of Cycle Phase/repeated measures, or interaction effect between Sex and Cycle Phase, was found in any of the networks. A sensitivity (power) analysis revealed given a power of 0.80, and p-level of 0.05, that medium to large effects can be excluded (\u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.14)  . Neither of the multiple regression analyses for women only, using individual hormone levels as regressors, was significant. The total brain volume differed significantly between men and women (F(1,29)\u200a=\u200a22.7; p<0.001; \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.44), though no effect of Cycle Phase/repeated measures or interaction between Sex and Cycle Phase was found. When total brain volume was not included as covariate in the analysis of the four components' spatial maps, the following changes with respect to sex differences were evident: for the right dorsal network, an additional region in the right MFG (31 voxels) was found showing higher connectivity in women. For the anterior network, the right IPL no longer showed higher connectivity for women. No sex differences were found for any of the estimated movement parameters. Also, excluding of the movement parameters as covariates from the ANOVAs, did not change the results significantly. The ICC analysis revealed medium to high reliability for men and women in overlapping areas (see  ), which also follow the fronto-parietal localization of the components. The voxel-based morphometric analyses on modulated gray matter maps revealed no significant effects. \n   Sex differences in fronto-parietal networks.  \nMain effect of sex was found for two networks.

Two of these networks showed sex differences, comprising the right dorsal network and the anterior network (see  ,  ). For these two networks, women showed generally higher functional connectivity, and particularly in prefrontal regions. No menstrual cycle effects were found. Reliability maps show medium to high reliability for both men and women (see  ). \n\n### Trait and state aspects of sex (hormonal) differences in resting state \n  \nAs to what degree resting state activity is stable across testing sessions or susceptible to mind states of the participant is debated in the literature. The current study further investigated stability versus variability by using sex as trait measure and hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle as state measure. The main effect of sex (together with the non-significant Sex by Cycle Phase interaction) in fronto-parietal networks (see  ,  ) argues for stable sex differences in resting state across time. These findings also suggest that sex differences in resting state occur independently of females' sex-hormonal state during different cycle phases. Moreover, it has been shown (see  ) that the test-retest reliability of the ICC maps for all four components is medium to high in   both   men and women. \n\nSex-hormonal effects on the brain are broadly divided into two categories of organizing (trait) and activating (state) effects  \u2013 . Although this distinction is not as clear-cut, organizing effects of sex hormones occur mainly early in ontogenesis   or during puberty  , and are believed to establish permanent sex differences in brain structure and corresponding functions. Activating effects of sex hormones are, however, transitory and mainly related to dynamic functional changes in the brain. Due to the fact that the present study found functional connectivity in fronto-parietal resting networks to be relatively stable across three sessions (and menstrual cycle phases) in both sexes, the results might suggest sexual dimorphisms in underlying white matter structure, which were not affected by activation effects of sex hormones. This also suggests that menstrual cycle effects reported in previous fMRI studies occur as a result of sex-hormonal modulation of task-related brain activity. It is less likely that sex hormones modulate the underlying functional connectivity that is task independent, at least for resting state networks that were investigated in the present study. \n\nIn fact, several studies suggest sex differences in white matter, also when brain size is controlled for  . Although women have generally shown smaller total white matter volume than men  , a recent diffusion MRI tractography study revealed greater overall cortical connectivity in women after correcting for brain size  . For frontal regions in particular, women have shown higher functional anisotropy (FA) than men  , also involving anterior parts of the corpus callosum  ,  . In contrast, men revealed higher FA in the   left   superior longitudinal fasciculus relative to women  . Interestingly, an FA increase in the   right   superior longitudinal fasciculus was observed in female-to-male transsexuals after hormonal treatment  . However, how exactly these sexual dimorphisms in white matter relate to functional connectivity in resting state fMRI must be further explored in future studies. The current study argues though, that regional   gray matter   sexual dimorphisms are unlikely to underlie the sex differences found in resting state, as the gray matter maps analysis showed no sex-differences. \n\n\n### Sex differences in fronto-parietal resting state networks \n  \nWomen showed generally higher connectivity as compared to men, and the largest cluster was found in the left MFG for the anterior network. Another cluster is found in the right MFG for the right dorsal network when brain volume correction is left out. Several previous rs-fMRI studies report women to have higher connectivity in prefrontal regions for cognitive networks, including IFG  ,  , MFG  ,   and medial prefrontal regions  ,  ,  . However, of all the studies that found sex differences in resting state, only three addressed fronto-parietal networks. Whereas Allen et al.  , and Weissman-Fogel et al.   did not find sex differences, Filippi et al.   report higher connectivity for women in the right IFG, and left cerebellum for a network similar to the right dorsal network in the current study. They also reported higher connectivity in the right insula and cerebellar regions for a network similar to the left dorsal network of the current study. Further, Filippi et al.   found stronger connectivity for men in posterior regions (i.e., right STG and left IPL for the right dorsal network, and left SPL for the left dorsal network). In contrast to these findings, the current study did not detect regions of higher connectivity in men relative to women. However, in support of Filippi et al.   we found that women relative to men showed the strongest connectivity in prefrontal and cerebellar regions, though in addition parietal areas were found. As for the sex differences in MFG connectivity, it is also interesting to note that Zuo et al.   reported higher homotopic connectivity in this region for women. \n\nSex differences in functional brain organization of the prefrontal cortex have already been proposed in task-related studies, in which men and women also showed a behavioral difference. Neuroimaging studies have shown that in the visuospatial domain, women engage more prefrontal regions  \u2013 , while men activate more parietal  ,   or sensory   regions. Butler et al.   suggest that these sex differences in activation might indicate that men and women apply different strategies to identical cognitive problems. That is, women perform mental rotation tasks by more effortful \u201ctop-down\u201d control, whereas men rely more on automatic \u201cbottom-up\u201d processes. Others have suggested, based on observed higher left prefrontal activation that women rely more on verbal strategies in mental rotation  . These sex differences in functional brain organization are only partly reflected in the current rs-fMRI study. Although we found higher functional connectivity in anterior and posterior regions in women, both task-related and rs-fMRI suggest higher functional activity and connectivity, respectively, in particular for prefrontal regions. For men, however, the current study did not find a clear link between task-related and rs-fMRI in posterior regions  . Given that sex differences in resting state- and task-related fMRI involve similar brain regions and networks, it is possible that sex differences in resting state underlie some of the reported sex differences in task-related brain activation and behavior. \n\nAnother principal of functional brain organization is lateralization of cortical functions. Sex differences in lateralization in resting state are inconsistent. It is widely assumed that men are generally more lateralized than women in various cognitive abilities  \u2013 ,  . In line with this observation, Liu et al.   suggest men to be more lateralized in both left and right lateralized systems. In contrast, Filippi et al.   suggested women to be more lateralized than men in default mode, and attention networks, but for fronto-parietal networks this study did not find any sex differences in lateralization. In the current study, women show higher connectivity in both left and right MFG, which might suggest commonalities with studies showing more bilateral activation and connectivity in the female brain. However given that these two findings belong to two different networks, this is rather speculative. \n\nIn addition to the stronger prefrontal functional connectivity in women, the anterior fronto-parietal network shows higher connectivity in the precuneus. This parietal region is suggested to be a core region in the default mode network  . The activity in the default mode network exhibits an anti-correlation with the activity in the task-positive fronto-parietal network  ,  . The current results might thereby imply less anti-correlation between the fronto-parietal network and the default mode network in women as compared to men. Similarly, Bluhm et al.   have found higher connectivity for women relative to men between the default mode network, and prefrontal and parietal regions (ICA). This study also found higher connectivity within default mode regions in women (seed-based analysis). The former finding might suggest closer communication between fronto-parietal and default mode areas in women. In contrast to the task-positive network, the default mode network is associated with inwards direction of attention, such as engagement in self-referential thoughts   and episodic memory  . \n\n\n### Lack of menstrual cycle effect \n  \nThis study investigated the activating effects of sex hormones on rs-fMRI, and whether the partly conflicting findings regarding sex differences in rs-fMRI depend on female participants' sex-hormonal state. We have previously shown estradiol-related changes in cognitive control across the menstrual cycle in the same cohort  , and we therefore focused particularly on the intrinsic functional connectivity in fronto-parietal resting state networks. However, no menstrual cycle effect or hormone-rs-fMRI correlations were found. \n\nThe lack of menstrual cycle effects suggests that the previously observed hormonal effects in cognitive control may depend more on actual task execution rather than on intrinsic functional connectivity during resting state. In fact, previous fMRI studies found task-related changes in frontal and parietal brain activity in relation to sex hormones  , and task-related connectivity changes in frontal and parietal brain activity in relation to sex hormones  ,  . Also during rest, previous studies report menstrual cycle related changes in PFC in glucose metabolism  , alpha asymmetry  , and glutamate levels  . These results might indicate that resting state network connectivity, in particular, is unaffected by sex hormones. However, the lacking menstrual cycle effect in the current study might also be partly due to a methodological issues. Given that rs-fMRI relies on the detection of low frequency BOLD signal fluctuations, it may be less sensitive to state changes as compared to task-fMRI. Damoiseaux et al.   have shown that for healthy subjects, rs-fMRI is consistent across subjects and sessions for a number of networks, including the executive functioning. It is therefore reasonable to assume that rs-fMRI in its current application is not sensitive enough to reliably detect hormone level related changes in functional connectivity. Furthermore, we cannot rule out that other than fronto-parietal resting state networks are sensitive to sex-hormonal changes, or that it is rather the inter-network connectivity that are affected, and/or that other sex hormones (e.g., testosterone) exert transient influences on resting state connectivity. \n\nIt is important to note, however, that a recent rs-fMRI study   found menstrual cycle-related effects on intrinsic functional connectivity in default mode, and also in the executive control network comparable to fronto-parietal networks investigated in the current study. Specifically, Petersen et al.   found higher connectivity in the right anterior cingulate region for women tested in the menstrual phase (which they refer to as \u2018early follicular\u2019) as compared to the luteal phase, as well as higher connectivity in the left MFG in the menstrual phase as compared to women taking hormonal contraceptives. Despite of several methodological similarities between this and the current study, there were also some differences that might partly account for the conflicting findings. For instance, the preprocessing procedures differed leading to presumably stricter thresholding of our results. In addition, the power might be higher in Petersen et al.'s study as it includes data from a larger sample (20 menstrual phase, and 25 luteal phase). However, women in the menstrual phase (cycle day 2 to 6) in Petersen et al.'s study revealed physiologically unusually high progesterone levels (ca. 100 pg/ml, as compared to 53.2 pg/ml (cycle day 2 to 4) in the current study). This also resulted in relatively small differences in progesterone level between the menstrual and luteal phase of about 40 pg/ml, as compared to 138 pg/ml in the current study. Given that Petersen et al. did also not find significant cycle-related difference in estradiol levels, it is puzzling whether all women in Petersen et al.'s study were tested in the correct cycle phase. In other words, the current study should have been even more likely to find sex hormonal effects on rs-fMRI, if this effect really exists. However, this was obviously not the case. Therefore, it should be considered that the effect of Petersen may be due to some cycle-unrelated differences between the groups (e.g. differences in personality traits) as a between-subjects design was used. Such factors are better controlled by repeated measures design. Finally, it should be noted that Petersen et al. tested a sample of women only (between-subject design) while the current study tested a sample of female and male participants three times in a repeated measures design. Although it is unclear whether the inclusion of male control group can account for the conflicting findings between studies, it has been shown to provide important baseline information of random variability in repeated measure rs-fMRI. As visualized in the effect size maps (see   &  ), the effect sizes for cycle-related fluctuations in rs-fMRI were similarly small as they were for rs-fMRI fluctuations between the male groups. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe current study investigated sex differences and menstrual cycle effects in resting state functional connectivity of fronto-parietal cognitive control networks. Women showed generally higher functional connectivity, including in prefrontal regions, as compared to men. However, no menstrual cycle effects were found. The implications of these findings are multiple. First, the sex differences found in functional brain organization in fronto-parietal networks show similarities to those reported for task-related fMRI (e.g., visuospatial tasks), and might underlie at least partly sex differences in brain activation and behavior. Second, the lack of menstrual cycle effects suggest that sex hormones can be linked to task execution rather than hormonal modulation of underlying resting state connectivity. However, this needs to be investigated in future rs-fMRI studies, and requires to directly compare sex and sex-hormonal effects of task-fMRI and rs-fMRI. Finally, in spite of the unconstrained nature of rs-fMRI (i.e. not restricted by task), the current study revealed stable resting state networks in   both   men and women, indicating that rs-fMRI is generally a reliable technique, and further suggests that   resting states   can be considered as   resting traits  . \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4110030, "text_md5": "aa460e27ac3eb5e94ea2a821b5382f31", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 99], "journal": [100, 108], "publication_year": [110, 114], "title": [125, 265], "keywords": [279, 279], "abstract": [292, 1585], "body": [1594, 41232]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 25057823, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0103492", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4110030", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4110030"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4110030\">4110030</a>", "list_title": "PMC4110030  Resting States Are Resting Traits \u2013 An fMRI Study of Sex Differences and Menstrual Cycle Effects in Resting State Cognitive Control Networks"}

From the woman\u2019s perspective, all gifts are not always equally rewarding; the reward value of a gift depends on two factors: (1) the giver and (2) the type of the gift (the gift\u2019s social meaning). In this study, we investigated how these two factors interactively determine the reward value of a gift. Specifically, we examined how the neural processing for understanding a gift\u2019s social meaning is modulated by preferences for the giver. We performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which a female participant was asked to judge a gift from a male she was acquainted with in real life. We examined the interactive effects between (1) the female participant\u2019s attitude toward the male acquaintance (liked vs. uninteresting) and (2) the type of the gift (romantic [e.g., bouquet, earrings, and perfumes] vs. non-romantic [e.g., pencils, memo pad, and moneybox]). We found that preference for an acquaintance selectively modulated activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in response to romantic gifts, compared to non-romantic gifts. In contrast, if the woman was indifferent toward an acquaintance, no activity modulation was observed in this area for the same gifts. In addition, the ACC showed functional connectivity with the supplementary motor area/dorsal ACC (SMA/dACC), an area within the dorsal mediofrontal cortex, suggesting that it integrates action monitoring and emotional and cognitive processing in decision-making. These results suggest that attitude toward an opposite sex member has a modulatory role in recognizing the social meaning of material goods\u2014preference for the member is a powerful modulator of social reward processing. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPositive interpersonal relationships are crucial for healthy social life, and among them, courtship relationships are one of the most important ones. Human courtship relationships are putatively an evolved form of mammalian mate choice\u2014there are robust biological mechanisms in the human brain that result in a powerful drive to build positive interactions with a desired partner [ ]. People experience a complex of affective, cognitive, and rewarding states in courtship relationships [ , ]. \n\nLike many male animals that use gifts during courtship and mating [ ], men use gifts to build satisfactory relationships with women [ \u2013 ]. Gifts are an example of material goods with rewarding properties. In the human brain, neural signals compute these properties to assess motivational relevance in decision-making [ ]. Therefore, all received gifts are not equally rewarding\u2014intuitively, the reward value of a gift depends on (1) the giver and (2) the type of the gift. In courtship relationships, the type of a gift can convey the social meaning of romantic intentions from the giver. \n\nAlthough literature suggests that the reward system is highly involved in human courtship relationships [ , \u2013 ], little is known about the neural processing for the social meaning of material goods in preference-related decision-making. A person\u2019s preference for others affects many social judgments. For instance, attractive models shown in advertisements influence consumer buying behavior [ , ]. Neuroimaging studies have revealed that the subcortical and prefrontal cortical areas are engaged in preference-related decision-making, such as facial attractiveness [ ], trustworthiness [ ], and appropriate punishment [ , ]. \n\nRegarding the social meaning of gifts, people acknowledge the meaning independent of the giver: a gift   per se   can be considered romantic when it contains more personal or love-expressing contents (e.g., cosmetics, perfume, roses, and chocolates) [ , \u2013 ], and it can be non-romantic when it contains more impersonal or non-love\u2014expressing contents (e.g., snacks, drinks, coupons, and CDs) [ , ]. People use non-romantic gifts to reinforce social solidarity or to conform to a sense of obligation [ , ]. \n\nConsidering these two factors, we assumed that women\u2019s preferences for the giver affect their understanding of the social meaning of gifts. In this study, we investigated how the two factors (giver and type of gift) interactively determine the neural reward value of the gift. Particularly, we examined how preference for a giver affects the neural processing for understanding a gift\u2019s social meaning. We performed fMRI in a novel setting in which female participants were asked to judge the value of gifts from two male acquaintances they knew in real life: for each female participant, one male giver was preferred, while she was indifferent toward the other giver (i.e., the \u201cliked\u201d and \u201cuninteresting\u201d givers). The social meaning of the gift (i.e., gift type) was either \u201cromantic\u201d or \u201cnon-romantic.\u201d \n\nWe assumed that neural processing is a two-step process; that is, people make judgments after perceiving others, especially their faces [ , , ]. Therefore, we made the following two predictions regarding the neural processing for understanding a gift\u2019s social meaning. First, a recipient pays attention to who the giver is, and reward-related areas first assess preferences for the opposite sex member. Second, the recipient then considers the social meaning of the gift. The reward-related areas that process preferences for the giver modulate activity in brain areas related to understanding the social meaning of gifts. To our knowledge, this is the first fMRI study showing how preference for an opposite sex member affects the neural processing for understanding a gift\u2019s social meaning. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Ethics Statement \n  \nThe study complied with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by respective ethics committees on human research: the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (No. 1705); and the Ethics Committee of Tamagawa University (N24-4). All participants in this study gave written informed consent prior to participation. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-seven healthy, right-handed Japanese female students from Tamagawa University participated in the fMRI experiment. Their handedness was tested using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ ]. Their mean age was 19.81 \u00b1 1.14 (standard deviation, s.d.) years. They reported no psychiatric or neurological medical history, and they were not taking medications that might influence fMRI results. Seven participants were excluded due to excessive movements > 5 mm (4 participants), sleep (2), and poor understanding of the fMRI task (1). Thus, data from 20 participants (mean age = 19.89 \u00b1 1.10 years) were analyzed. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nBefore the fMRI experiment, 31 Japanese female students (pre-raters; mean age: 19.90 \u00b1 1.33 years) judged the attractiveness of 120 pictures of material goods on a 9-point scale (1: the least attractive, 9: the most attractive). The pre-raters were age- and education-matched with the fMRI participants\u2014they were from the same university and in the same age group (two-sample   t  -test; fMRI participants, n = 20; pre-raters, n = 31; t  = 0.02, p = 0.98). The pictures of material goods were clothes, sweets, accessories, etc., freely available on the Internet and displayed at 150 \u00d7 150 pixel resolution. We chose 60 material goods judged as moderately attractive as target stimuli (mean attractiveness = 5.09 \u00b1 0.57 on the 9-point scale), to avoid a ceiling or floor effect when the fMRI participants judge them as gifts. We also asked the fMRI participants to judge the attractiveness of the 60 goods before the experiment, but at that time, we gave no instruction about the task (judging the gift attractiveness). We confirmed marginal, but not significant, difference in the attractiveness of the material goods   per se   between the fMRI participants and pre-raters (two-sample   t  -test; fMRI participants, n = 20; pre-raters, n = 31; t  = 1.80, p = 0.08). \n\nWe then asked the pre-raters to judge the social meaning of each of the 60 material goods on a 3-point scale, if they had received it as a gift from a male. The question was described as below: \n \nAssume that you had received each of the goods as a birthday gift from a male. A gift symbolizes a personal message from the male giver. Do you find the gift romantic? If yes, choose 3; if no, choose 1; and if you are not sure whether it is romantic or not, choose 2. \n \nBased on the rating, we divided the 60 material goods into two groups: 30 romantic and 30 non-romantic gifts (see   and   Tables). The mean ratings for romantic and non-romantic gifts were 2.44 \u00b1 0.34 and 1.58 \u00b1 0.28, respectively. There was a significant difference in the ratings between the gift types (Mann-Whitney U-test; pre-raters, n = 31; U = 26.50, Z = \u22126.39, p < 0.001). We used the gifts validated by the pre-raters for the fMRI experiment. The reasons we did not ask the fMRI participants to judge the gift\u2019s meaning are: 1) if we asked them to judge prior to the fMRI experiment, they might have understood what we were interested in testing (the demand characteristics effect), and 2) if we asked them to judge after the experiment, the fMRI task might have affected their judgments (the carryover effect). \n\nBefore the task, we asked the fMRI participants to describe two male acquaintances. For each participant, one male acquaintance was preferred (\u201cliked\u201d male), while she was indifferent toward the other male acquaintance (\u201cuninteresting\u201d male). To make the situation as real as possible, we had a short dialogue for at least 5 minutes with the participants and asked what they thought of the liked male. This dialogue was aimed to make the participants to imagine the liked male vividly during the task. All males were university students. The participants knew the liked male for 6.8 \u00b1 3.6 months. Twelve of them were in the lovelorn state and eight of them were dating for less than 6 months. The participants had met the liked males in high school, in a classroom at the same university, or at a club activity inside or outside the campus. We also asked them to draw portraits of each male. Each portrait was displayed at 100 \u00d7 100 pixel resolution during the fMRI task. \n\n\n### Task \n  \nBefore the task, we asked the fMRI participants to read a setting in which they receive a gift from the liked and uninteresting males. The setting read as follows: \n \nImagine you are having a birthday party at home. You have two male friends attending the party, one whom you prefer, and the other whom you are indifferent to. Each of them talks to you privately. Each tells you that he brought a birthday gift especially for you. Please judge the attractiveness of the gift that you receive on a 9-point scale, where 1 is the minimum and 9 is the maximum. You should evaluate only the gift, not the giver. Do not imagine that these judgments would change the real relationship between you and the giver. Please concentrate on the judgments and press the button as quickly as possible. \n \nWe used the E-prime 2.0 Professional Software (Psychology Software Tools, Sharpsburg, PA, U.S.A.). We performed the task in an event-related design but we combined six trials from either the liked or the uninteresting giver in a set ( )\u2014we wanted to ensure that the participants focus on the gift judgment. Each set contained four target trials (judgments of romantic and non-romantic gifts) mixed with two control trials. The trials were pseudo-randomized, and the order of the sets was counterbalanced across participants. Each trial was followed by the next one after the participants judged the gift's attractiveness. The maximum length of a trial was 6 sec, and a fixation point appeared for 6\u201310 sec after each trial. \n   The fMRI task.  \n(A) The task was conducted in an event-related design. Six trials from either the liked or the uninteresting male acquaintance were combined in a set. Each set contained pseudo-randomized four target trials (shown in red) with two control trials (shown in blue). (B) Each trial was created by a 2 \u00d7 3 factorial design. In a target trial, female participants judged the gift attractiveness (1: the least attractive, 9: the most attractive). In a control trial, the participants simply pressed the button when a white dot appeared by the side of the portrait. For details, see  . \n  \nIn each target trial, a portrait of a giver, a picture of a gift, and a rating scale were displayed simultaneously ( ). The participants used a keypad to rate the attractiveness of the gift. The keypad was separated for the left and right hands. The left five fingers corresponded to the ratings 1\u20135 and the four right fingers, except the little finger, corresponded to the ratings 6\u20139. The participants had practiced to press buttons correctly before the task. Gift attractiveness and reaction time (RT) for judgments were recorded. We conducted control trials to subtract brain activity on simply viewing the giver and pressing the buttons. In each control trial, a white dot appeared either on the left or on the right side of the portrait ( ). The participants pressed the button with the left/right index finger if the dot appeared on the left/right. \n\nOne task lasted for approximately 30 min. Participants were debriefed at the end of the study. They were also questioned about the task, and they received JP \\5,000 (equivalent to US $50). \n\n\n### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nWe analyzed behavioral data using the SPSS software (SPSS 19.0 for Mac, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). We analyzed the four target conditions created by the 2 \u00d7 2 factors (giver \u00d7 gift type) ( ). Because participants received the same gifts from each male, we conducted two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on gift attractiveness and RT. Pairwise comparisons were assessed using the Bonferroni correction [ , ]. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nFunctional imaging was conducted using a 3-Tesla Siemens Trio Tim MRI scanner (Erlangen, Germany) at Tamagawa University. For each participant, we acquired whole-brain T1-weighted anatomical scans (repetition time (TR), 2,000 ms; echo time (TE), 1.98 ms; flip angle (FA), 10\u00b0; field of view (FOV), 256 mm; matrix, 256 \u00d7 256; slice thickness, 1.0 mm; 192 sagittal slices) and gradient echo T2 weighted echo planar images (EPI) with BOLD contrast (TR, 2,500 ms; TE, 25 ms; FA, 90\u00b0; FOV, 192 mm; matrix, 64 \u00d7 64; slice thickness, 3.0 mm; 42 oblique axial slices). We used a tilted acquisition sequence at 30\u00b0 to the AC-PC line to prevent signal loss in the medial orbitofrontal cortex [ ]. Each brain volume comprised 42 axial slices of 3-mm thickness and 3-mm in-plane resolution. The first five volumes of the images were discarded for equilibration. \n\n\n### fMRI data preprocessing \n  \nImage data were analyzed using SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London, London, U.K.). Slice-timing correction was initially performed. To correct for participants\u2019 motion, the images were realigned to the mean image. Structural T1 images were co-registered to the mean functional EPI for each participant and normalized to the standard space of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). After normalization, all scans had a resolution of 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm . Spatial smoothing was applied using a Gaussian kernel with a full-width-at-half maximum (FWHM) of 8 mm. \n\n\n### Generalized linear model (GLM) \n  \nIn the first-level analysis, we modeled the four target conditions and two control conditions from each participant, created by the 2 \u00d7 3 factorial design ( ). Six parameters of head motion were entered as regressors of motion correction. High-pass temporal filtering (128 sec) was applied to the data. Because we wanted to remove brain activity that reflected simply viewing the giver and pressing the buttons from the target trials, we made four contrasts by subtracting the control trials. The following four contrasts were calculated for each participant: romantic gifts vs. controls and non-romantic gifts vs. controls for the liked givers, and romantic gifts vs. controls and non-romantic gifts vs. controls for the uninteresting giver. We then conducted second-level random-effects group analysis with the four contrasts using the flexible factorial design. We obtained main effects and pairwise comparisons from the second-level analysis. We also obtained the contrast of the controls (the liked vs. the uninteresting) at the second-level by using one-sample   t  -test. We used a voxel-wise threshold at p < 0.001, uncorrected. We then used a cluster-wise threshold at family-wise error (FWE) p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons to finally identify the significant brain activations. We used Xjview ( ) for displaying superimposed significant brain activations with multiple contrasts. \n\n\n### Region of Interest (ROI) analysis \n  \nWe used MarsBaR tool for SPM ( ) to extract activation (parameter estimates) from regions of interest (ROIs). The peak voxel of the ROI was derived from the main effect of the gifts (romantic vs. non-romantic gifts in MNI: \u20138/40/22). Spherical ROI of 6-mm radius was created for the peak voxel. We analyzed parameter estimates for each of the four conditions. Parameter estimates were extracted from each condition vs. baseline using one-sample   t  -test. We entered parameter estimates of the ROI from each participant into a group-level, to calculate means and standard error means (s.e.m.). \n\n\n### Psychophysiological Interaction (PPI) analysis \n  \nTo investigate functional connectivity of the left ACC, we performed a generalized psychophysical interaction (gPPI) analysis. We used a gPPI toolbox ( ) [ ] and set the left ACC (peak voxel in MNI: \u20138/36/30) as a seed region. This peak voxel was derived from the pairwise comparison of the gifts (romantic vs. non-romantic) from the liked giver. Eigenvariate of the peak voxel of the ROI as the voxel of interest at a radius of 6 mm was calculated from each participant. The BOLD signal of the voxel of interest was deconvolved to obtain an estimate of the neuronal signals. Then the neuronal signals from the left ACC seed were multiplied with regressors modeling the task effect and then reconvolved with the canonical HRF. The task effect represents the pairwise comparison of the romantic gift from the liked vs. the uninteresting giver, because we were interested in connectivity in the specific condition in which a participant judges a romantic gift from the liked giver. Model estimation was applied and the resulting SPM showed areas with significant connectivity to the seed. We entered the result of each participant into the second-level random-effects group analysis and used one-sample   t  -test. We used a voxel-wise threshold at p < 0.001, uncorrected; we then used a conservative cluster size criterion with more than 80 contiguous voxels in the cluster. Many PPI studies do not use cluster-wise threshold. Likewise, we used the voxel-wise threshold and cluster size criterion to identify significant functional connectivity. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nThe gift attractiveness showed significant main effects of both the giver and gift type (two-way repeated measures ANOVA, giver, F  = 458.50, p < 0.001; gift type, F  = 7.91, p < 0.01,  ). The interaction between these two factors was also significant (F  = 8.34, p < 0.01). A pairwise comparison of gift attractiveness between the gift types showed a significant difference from the liked giver (Bonferroni corrected p < 0.001,  ). However, there was no significant difference in the attractiveness from the uninteresting giver (Bonferroni corrected p = 0.76,  ). This indicates that a romantic gift is more attractive than a non-romantic gift, only when a recipient liked the giver. \n   Behavioral results.  \n(A) Mean gift attractiveness across the four target conditions showed significant main effects of both factors and a significant interaction between the two factors (n = 20, two-way repeated measures ANOVA, giver, p < 0.001; gift type, p < 0.01; interaction, p < 0.01). A pairwise comparison showed a difference in attractiveness between gift types for the liked giver (Bonferroni corrected p < 0.001) but not for the uninteresting giver. (B) Mean RT in value judgments across the four target conditions showed only significant main effect of giver (n = 20, two-way repeated measures ANOVA, p < 0.01). Bars show means, and error bars show s.e.m., ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. \n  \nThe mean reaction time (RT) showed significant main effect of giver but not the gift type (two-way repeated measures ANOVA, giver, F  = 8.67, p < 0.01; gift type: F  = 0.09, p = 0.77,  ). The interaction between these factors was not significant (F  = 1.64, p = 0.21). A pairwise comparison of the RT between the gift types did not show a significant difference from both givers (the liked, Bonferroni corrected p = 0.49; the uninteresting, Bonferroni corrected p = 0.90,  ). A recipient spends more time to judge gifts from the liked than the uninteresting giver, regardless of the gift type. We did not counterbalance the keypads for judgments (i.e., the left hand for lower ratings [from 1 to 5]; the right hand for higher ratings [from 6 to 9]). We interpret the short RT from the uninteresting giver that the participants dexterously decided the gift value with their left hands, although they were all right-handed. \n\n\n### fMRI results \n  \n#### Main effects and pairwise comparisons \n  \nFirst, we analyzed the contrast of the control conditions (the liked vs. the uninteresting giver). This is important to validate that the experimental manipulations of the target conditions led to the expected brain activations. There was no significant activation in this contrast: there was no significant difference in brain activation between the liked and uninteresting control conditions. \n\nWe found a main effect of giver (liked vs. uninteresting) for activation in the bilateral caudate ( ,  ). We performed a pairwise comparison between the givers with the same gift type (i.e., the romantic/non-romantic gifts from the liked vs. uninteresting giver). We found overlapped activation in the same areas for both pairwise comparisons ( ). Caudate activation reflects an increase in the gift attractiveness modulated by the liked giver. We also found activations in other brain areas including the left posterior insula, right fusiform gyrus, and right parahippocampus ( ). \n   Brain activation for the effect of the givers.  \n(A) Significant activation was found in the bilateral caudate with a main effect of giver (liked vs. uninteresting). (B) Superimposed significant activations in the bilateral caudate for a pairwise comparison between givers for romantic (in purple) and non-romantic (in green) gifts (i.e., romantic/non-romantic gifts from the liked vs. the uninteresting giver). All activations are displayed at a threshold of p < 0.001, uncorrected at the voxel-level. \n     Significant brain activations observed in contrast analyses.        \nThen, we found a significant main effect of the gift type (romantic vs. non-romantic) on left ACC activity at the voxel-level but not at the cluster-level ( ,  ). A pairwise comparison between the gift types from the liked giver showed significant difference in activation in this area both at the voxel- and cluster-level ( ,  ). In contrast, we found no significant difference for a pairwise comparison between the gift types from the uninteresting giver. Taken together, the preference for a giver strongly modulates ACC activity while judging romantic compared to non-romantic gifts. To confirm this, we calculated parameter estimates of the ROI in this area across the four target conditions (peak voxel derived from the main effect in MNI: \u20138/40/22,  ). \n   Brain activation for the effect of the gift types.  \n(A) The left ACC showed a significant main effect of the gift type (romantic vs. non-romantic) at the voxel-level but not at the cluster-level. (B) The left ACC showed significant difference both at the voxel- and cluster-level for a pairwise comparison between the gift types from the liked giver. (C) Parameter estimates of the ROI in the left ACC across the four target conditions. The peak voxel is derived from the main effect of the gift types. All activations are displayed at a threshold of p < 0.001, uncorrected at the voxel-level. Parameter estimates are in arbitrary units and error bars are s.e.m. \n  \nWe found no significant interaction of the giver and gift type. \n\n\n#### Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis \n  \nWe explored functional connectivity of the left ACC, resultant of a pairwise comparison between the gift types from the liked giver (peak voxel in MNI: \u20138/36/30). The target contrast for PPI was a pairwise comparison between the givers for romantic gifts (i.e., the romantic gifts from the liked vs. the uninteresting giver)\u2014we investigated functional connectivity in the specific condition in which a female judges a romantic gift from the liked male giver. We found connectivity with the left supplementary motor area/dorsal ACC (SMA/dACC) (peak voxel in MNI: \u20136/6/56, Z-score = 4.36, cluster size = 89 contiguous voxels,  ). \n   Functional connectivity from the left ACC seed.  \nSignificant functional connectivity from the left ACC (seed) was found in the left SMA/dACC in PPI analysis. Activation of PPI is displayed at a threshold of p < 0.001, uncorrected at the voxel-level. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first fMRI study to clarify the neural correlates of how preferences for the giver modulate understanding of the gift\u2019s meaning. We found two-fold neural processing for value judgments of gifts. First, preferences for the giver modulated activation in the caudate. Second, while processing of the social meaning of the gifts, preferences for the giver selectively modulated activity in ACC, a cortical area in the reward system. We suggest that the ACC is a preference-dependent detector of the social meaning of material goods in gift-judgment situations. \n\nOur behavioral results showed that preferences for the giver and gift type both affected the gifts\u2019 value from the liked giver. Contrarily, only the indifference toward the giver, and not the gift type, affected the value of a gift from the uninteresting giver. These findings suggest the two-fold mechanisms in value judgments for gifts: gift recipients first consider who the giver is; they then consider what the gift means only if they like the giver. The fact that the gift type differentiated the gift\u2019s value only from the liked giver suggests a modulatory role of preferences for the giver from the opposite sex in understanding of the gifts\u2019 social meaning. \n\nWe found the same pattern in fMRI results. First, the attitude toward the liked giver activated the caudate. The gift type (romantic or non-romantic) did not affect activity in this area. Preference for a desired person activates the dopamine-rich reward circuits such as the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and caudate [ , \u2013 ]. Importantly, the caudate activation observed in our study was not induced by passively viewing the liked but by receiving gifts from the liked giver. We showed this by subtracting activity for the control tasks (passively viewing the giver and pressing buttons) from that for the target tasks. Preferences for the liked giver and detection of rewards (gifts) therefore modulate activity in the caudate. \n\nRegarding the social meaning of the gifts, romantic gifts   per se   can be a reward, because we found a weak activation in the ACC for the romantic, relative to the non-romantic gifts. This ACC activity, albeit weak, is independent of the giver and suggests that this area attends to the interpretation of the social meaning of the gifts. Previous studies showed that ACC activity reflects increased autonomic nervous activity and attention levels [ ]. Importantly, preferences for the liked giver profoundly modulated ACC activity in response to romantic gifts. Contrarily, we did not find this modulation for the uninteresting giver. This giver-dependent activation pattern suggests that understanding of the social meaning is strongly influenced by the givers and that the female participants do not dismiss the social meaning solely by speculating on the feelings of the givers. Our interpretation is based on the fact that we instructed the participants only to focus on judging the attractiveness of the gifts without considering the givers. If the participants had simply speculated on the feelings of the givers, we would also have found specific brain activation in response to romantic gifts from uninteresting givers. Additionally, the ACC is also involved in preferences for a partner [ , ]. Preferences for the liked giver therefore increase autonomic arousal and attention levels, and the area selectively detects socially meaningful rewards (romantic gifts). \n\nA more logical understanding of the ACC function in interpreting the social meaning of the gifts can also be achieved from another perspective. Gifts on specific social occasions contain rewarding properties. These properties are computed in the brain to assess motivational relevance in decision-making [ ]. Highly rewarding gifts (i.e., romantic gifts) therefore provide stronger motivation to the recipients in making value judgments. This reward value computation (i.e., to determine whether the object of choice is valuable) is performed in the ACC [ ]. Additionally, the ACC uses reward value to choose optimal behavior [ \u2013 ]. Lesions in this area impair this reward-guided behavior in both monkeys and humans [ ,  ]. The ACC thus plays a vital role in interpreting the appropriate reward value (i.e., social meaning of the gifts) in decision-making. \n\nFurther, our finding of functional connectivity between the ACC and SMA/dACC suggests that this connectivity integrates monitoring others and emotional and social cognitive factors in decision-making. Monitoring others\u2019 action is important for adaptive behavior in social interactions [ ]. A conjunction analysis revealed functional overlap of action monitoring, emotional processing, and social cognitive processing in the dorsal mediofrontal cortex (dMFC) including the ACC, SMA, and dACC [ ]. Considering these findings, we found functional connectivity within the dMFC that integrates the giver\u2019s gift-giving behavior (i.e., action monitoring) with preferences for the liked giver and evaluation of the social meaning of the gift (i.e., emotional and social cognitive processing). This integration leads to a judgment of the attractiveness of the gift in positive interpersonal relationships. We performed functional connectivity analysis with the caudate as a seed region but found no significant connectivity. This may be due to the experimental paradigm in which we had only two givers for each participant and did not ask the participants to evaluate their liking for the givers. In spite of this technical limitation, we assume that the caudate, which responds to preferences for the liked giver, would affect social cognitive processing in the ACC indirectly via other brain regions. \n\nThere are two other limitations in this study. First, the current setting may be a stereotyped presentation in a given culture. However, the intention behind gifting behavior (e.g., to express love, to reinforce social solidarity, or to conform to a sense of obligation) is universal [ , , ]. Second, the categorical difference between the romantic and non-romantic gifts may not always be distinct, because we did not ask each fMRI participant to rate the social meaning of gifts. The reasons for this are mentioned previously (see  ). Additionally, we made the task as realistic as possible\u2014we did not use goods such as abstract shapes or blank boxes as a non-romantic gift because people hardly experience to receive such objects. \n\nThis study may have an implication for understanding of how humans evolved sophisticated social interactions by using goods. The neural gender difference will also be a scope of interest. Our study may also have clinical implications. People with schizophrenia have difficulty with a task that requires recognition of emotions of the self and others [ ]. They are impaired in social interactions [ ], and they do not appreciate the rewarding character of courtship relationships [ ]. Because the gift-judgment task in this study requires the faculty of recognizing emotions of the self and others in courtship relationships, it may provide another opportunity to investigate social dysfunction in schizophrenia. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis is the first fMRI study of the neural processing underlying how preferences for the giver modulate understanding of a gift\u2019s meaning. The female gift recipients first consider who the giver is and then consider what the gift means only if they like the giver. The attitude toward the liked but not the uninteresting giver modulates ACC activity to recognize the gift\u2019s social meaning. This preference-dependent detection of the social meaning may enable the recipients to assess the motivational relevance of gifts to make decisions in courtship relationships. Additional studies are needed to further determine the ACC function in other courtship situations. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4547715, "text_md5": "693efe62f71e3d3422dfbda5843ff1c6", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 99], "journal": [100, 108], "publication_year": [110, 114], "title": [125, 252], "keywords": [266, 266], "abstract": [279, 2075], "body": [2084, 33758]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 26301954, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0136168", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4547715", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4547715"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4547715\">4547715</a>", "list_title": "PMC4547715  Women\u2019s Preference for a Male Acquaintance Enhances Social Reward Processing of Material Goods in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex"}

Surprisingly little is known about the possible contribution of the cerebellum. To address this question, healthy participants underwent a differential fear conditioning paradigm during 7T magnetic resonance imaging. An event-related design allowed us to separate cerebellar fMRI signals related to the visual conditioned stimulus (CS) from signals related to the subsequent unconditioned stimulus (US; an aversive electric shock). We found significant activation of cerebellar lobules Crus I and VI bilaterally related to the CS+ compared to the CS-. Most importantly, significant activation of lobules Crus I and VI was also present during the unexpected omission of the US in unreinforced CS+ acquisition trials. This activation disappeared during extinction when US omission became expected. These findings provide evidence that the cerebellum has to be added to the neural network processing predictions and prediction errors in the emotional domain. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCerebellar disease has long been known to result in disordered motor performance and motor learning ( ;  ). Evidence has accumulated that cerebellar patients also present with various degrees of cognitive, emotional and behavioral abnormalities ( ). Because the microscopic structure of the cerebellum is highly homogeneous, it is often assumed that the cerebellum performs one single neural operation (see\u00a0Miall in\u00a0 ;  ;  ). The most popular current hypothesis states that the cerebellum acts as, or is part of, a predictive device (  for recent review). In the motor domain, it is assumed that the cerebellum is crucially involved in prediction of the sensory consequences of motor commands thought to be achieved via internal models ( ;  ;  ). These internal models have to be constantly adapted because\u00a0of a constantly changing inner and outer environment. Assumedly, the difference between the predicted and actual sensory outcome results in a sensory prediction error used to adapt the internal model and subsequent motor behavior. Although most studies have been performed in the motor domain, there is initial evidence that the cerebellum is involved in predictive control in the cognitive domain ( ;  ;  ). The aim of the present study was to show that this assumption also applies to the emotional domain. \n\nFear conditioning was used as a model system because the cerebellum is involved in acquisition of learned fear responses ( ;  ;  ;  ), and has known connections with several parts of the neural network underlying fear conditioning, including the limbic system ( ;  ). Furthermore, prediction errors are thought to be the main drivers of associative fear learning ( ;  ). In the fear conditioning literature, however, the possible role of the cerebellum in aversive prediction error processing has largely been ignored ( ;  ). Previous studies focused on the role of the amygdala, insula, midbrain periaqueductal gray and striatum ( ;  ;  ). We wanted to provide initial evidence that the cerebellum has to be added to the neural network processing predictions errors in learned fear responses. \n\nDuring fear conditioning, participants learn to predict that the initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) is followed by an unpleasant unconditioned stimulus (US). As a result, fear responses are elicited already at the time of CS presentation. The initial occurrence of the US is unexpected and has been considered as an error signal ( ). An event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design allowed us to separate blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI signals related to the CS, from signals related to the subsequent US. Participants learn within a very limited number of trials that the CS predicts the occurrence of the US, particularly if appropriate instructions are provided ( ;  ). In case the cerebellum is involved in prediction of the US, cerebellar fMRI signals should be high during CS presentation. As soon as learning has occurred, the occurrence of the US is expected. Thus, if the hypothesis is correct that the cerebellum contributes to aversive prediction errors, cerebellar activation should be increased at unexpected omission of the US (because\u00a0of a partial reinforcement schedule). During extinction, that is the repeated presentation of CS-only trials, omission of the US becomes expected and cerebellar fMRI signals at the time of US omission should decrease. \n\nIn accordance with the fMRI literature ( ), we found cerebellar activations related to prediction of the US. In addition, marked cerebellar activation was present during unexpected omission of the US, which disappeared during extinction. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum is involved in processing of aversive predictions and prediction errors, and has to be added to the neural network underlying emotional associative learning. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWhile acquiring 7T fMRI data, 27 participants underwent a differential fear conditioning and extinction paradigm using visual stimuli as CS and an unpleasant, but not painful electrical shock as aversive US.   displays the experimental paradigm as well as the event blocks chosen for fMRI analysis. Behavioral parameters included self-reported ratings prior to\u00a0and after the acquisition and extinction phases, and skin conductance responses\u00a0(SCR) during the experiment. Five supplementary tables are provided in  . \n   Experimental paradigm and overview of individual events.  \nCS\u00a0=\u00a0conditioned stimulus; US\u00a0=\u00a0unconditioned stimulus. For further details see text. \n  \n### Behavioral data \n  \n#### Questionnaires \n  \n##### Valence and arousal ratings \n  \nAfter habituation and prior to acquisition, there was no difference in (hedonic) valence and (emotional) arousal ratings of the CS+ and CS- ( ). After acquisition, valence of the CS+ was rated less pleasant than\u00a0that of the CS-. Additionally, arousal to the CS+ was rated higher than\u00a0that to the CS-. Differences between CS+ and CS- ratings remained after extinction, a finding that has been reported as resistance to extinction in evaluative conditioning research (e.g.  ;  ). ANOVA with repeated measures showed a significant difference within stimulus types and phases (pre-acquisition, post-acquisition, post-extinction) considering both valence and arousal (main effects: all p<0.002). Valence and arousal ratings differed between stimulus type and phases (interaction stimulus type\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0phase: valence: F  = 14.95, p<0.001; arousal: F  = 15.30, p<0.001). Post hoc tests showed a significant difference between stimulus types after acquisition and after extinction (all p\u22640.005; paired   t  -test), but not prior to acquisition (valence: p=0.781, arousal: p=0.125). \n   Behavioral data.  \n(  a  ) Group mean valence and arousal ratings for CS+ and CS- during acquisition and extinction.

Error bars represent standard errors of the mean. acq 1, acq 2\u00a0=\u00a0early and late acquisition; CS\u00a0= conditioned stimulus; ext 1, ext 2\u00a0=\u00a0early and late extinction;\u00a0FIR\u00a0= first interval response; hab =\u00a0habituation;\u00a0SCR\u00a0= skin conductance response; SIR = second interval responses. \n  \n \n\n##### US unpleasantness and CS-US contingency \n  \nAfter acquisition, the mean US unpleasantness rating was 6.9 (SD\u00a0=\u00a01.4) on a 9-point scale from \u2018not unpleasant\u2019 to \u2018very unpleasant\u2019. All participants were aware of CS-US contingencies after the acquisition phase: The mean estimated probability that a CS+ was followed by an US was 70.0% (SD\u00a0=\u00a013.0%). All but one participant estimated a 0% probability of a CS- being followed by a US, with the remaining participant stating a 10% chance. Participants stated that they became aware of CS-US contingencies after 2.9 min (SD\u00a0=\u00a01.2 min), or 2.6 (SD\u00a0=\u00a00.8) US events. \n\n\n\n#### SCR \n  \nDuring habituation, second interval response (SIR) was not significantly different in CS+ and CS- trials (  t  \u00a0=\u00a00.708, p=0.487; paired   t  -test) ( ). During fear acquisition, SIR was significantly higher in CS+ trials compared to CS- trials ( ). This difference was most pronounced in the second half of the acquisition phase. ANOVA with repeated measures showed a significant main effect of stimulus type (CS+ vs. CS-;   F   = 5.182, p=0.033) and block (early vs. late;   F   = 5.589, p=0.028). The stimulus type by block interaction was not significant (  F   = 1.409, p=0.249). \n\nDuring fear extinction, SIR related to the CS+ declined. In the second half of extinction the difference between CS+ and CS- trials vanished ( ). The main effects of stimulus type (CS+ vs. CS-;   F   = 2.923, p=0.102) and block (early vs. late;   F   = 3.930, p=0.061) were not significant. ANOVA with repeated measures showed a significant stimulus type by block interaction (  F   = 5.035, p=0.036). Post hoc testing showed a significant difference between stimulus types during early (  t  \u00a0=\u00a02.24, p=0.036), but not during late extinction (  t  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.36, p=0.723). \n\nFindings concerning first interval response (FIR) were comparable to SIR and are summarized in   Table 1 and  . \n   Cerebellar activations during acquisition and extinction.  \nDisplayed are all clusters of \u226520 mm . In each cluster, up to three maxima are listed separated by \u22658 mm. Corresponding activations for whole brain analysis are summarized in   Table 5. \n  \nSCRs in the unconditioned response (UR) window (i.e. the third interval response, TIR) were significantly higher in paired CS+ trials (US post CS+) compared to CS- trials (no-US post CS-) (  F   = 93.70, p<0.001) indicating a successful increase in SCR towards the electric shock ( ). Block effect was significant (early vs. late;   F   = 21.97, p<0.001) revealing higher UR during early compared to late acquisition. The block by stimulus type interaction was not significant (  F   = 0.75, p=0.396). TIR was also significantly higher in unpaired CS+ trials (no-US post CS+) compared to CS- trials (no-US post CS-) during late acquisition (  t  \u00a0=\u00a03.72, p=0.001) but not early acquisition (  t  \u00a0=\u00a01.74, p=0.096), showing a higher US expectancy in US omission trials. TIR in unpaired CS+ trials was significantly smaller compared to TIR in paired CS+ trials (paired   t  -tests, all   p   values\u00a0<\u00a00.001). During extinction, TIR was not significantly different comparing stimulus types (no-US post CS+ vs. no-US post CS-;   F   = 3.46, p=0.077), blocks (early vs. late;   F   = 3.72, p=0.067) or their interaction (stimulus type by block;   F   = 0.02, p=0.878). \n\nTaken together, we could show successful fear acquisition and extinction as well as a response towards the presentation and omission of the US during fear acquisition. \n\n\n\n### fMRI data \n  \nWe were interested in cerebellar activations related to i) the presentation, ii) the prediction, and iii) the omission of the aversive electrical stimulation (that is, the US). The\u00a0focus of the\u00a0data analysis was cerebellar activations. In addition, exploratory data on whole brain analysis are\u00a0presented. Activation clusters are reported which are significant after application of threshold-free cluster-enhancement (TFCE) at p<0.05 familywise error (FWE) corrected level in all cases but conjunction analysis. Conjunction analysis results are reported at the level of p<0.05 FWE without TFCE. \n\n#### Cerebellar analysis \n  \n##### Cerebellar activation related to presentation of the aversive stimulus [contrast \u2018US post CS+\u00a0>\u00a0no US post CS-'] \n  \nWidespread cerebellar activation was observed within the cerebellar vermis and both cerebellar hemispheres ( ; see also  ). Most prominent differential activations were found in the anterior and posterior vermis (local maxima in lobules I-IV, V) and the left hemisphere (that is ipsilateral to the presentation of the US; local maximum in Crus I). Activation was not confined to the cerebellar cortex, but extended into the cerebellar nuclei (including dentate, interposed and fastigial nuclei bilaterally). \n   Diffential activations during fear acqusition.  \n(  a\u2013c  ) Differential cerebellar activations during fear acquisition in SUIT space projected on a cerebellar flatmap ( ).

Note that all no-US CS+ trials were considered as a single block which was compared first against the early and then against the late \u2018no-US post CS-\u2019 block.

Note that data displayed in (  d\u2013f  ) are identical to data shown in   of the main manuscript. For comparability, data overlays in (  a\u2013f  ) are scaled to the range of the overall minimal to maximal value. Cerebellar activation patterns were essentially unchanged. Physiological denoising and spatial smoothing, however, improved statistical power. CS\u00a0= conditioned stimulus; FWE = familywise error; L =\u00a0left, R\u00a0=\u00a0right;\u00a0TFCE\u00a0= threshold-free cluster-enhancement; US =\u00a0unconditioned\u00a0stimulus. \n  \n \nTo assess changes in differential cerebellar activation across the two acquisition blocks (early and late) an   F  -test based on second level within-subject ANOVA was calculated. No significant main effect of block was observed during acquisition (at p<0.05 FWE corrected level, based on the TFCE statistic). \n\n\n##### Cerebellar activation related to the prediction of the aversive stimulus [contrast \u2018CS+\u00a0>\u00a0CS-'] \n  \nCerebellar activation related to the CS+ was significantly higher in the lateral cerebellar hemispheres compared to activation related to the CS- ( ). Cerebellar activation was present in the more lateral parts of lobules VI and Crus I bilaterally (see also  ). Additional differential activation was present in lobules VIIIa and VIIIb in the right cerebellar hemisphere. During extinction, cerebellar activation related to the CS+ was not significantly different from activation related to the CS- (at p<0.05 FWE corrected level, based on the TFCE statistic). \n\n F  -tests revealed no significant block effects (early vs. late) neither during acquisition nor during extinction (at p<0.05 FWE corrected level, based on the TFCE statistic). The main effect of block across all four blocks (that is early and late acquisition, early and late extinction) revealed two clusters in the lateral cerebellum with local maxima in left lobule Crus I and right lobule VI ( ;  ). As can be seen from mean   \u03b2   values of both clusters across blocks (see insert in  ), differential activation in the two clusters decreased during extinction compared to acquisition. \n\n\n##### Cerebellar activation related to the omission of the aversive stimulus [contrast \u2018no-US post CS+\u00a0>\u00a0no US post CS-'] \n  \nDuring acquisition, significant differential activation related to the (unexpected) omission of the US was found in the cerebellar hemispheres and the vermis ( ). Activation at the time of the expected US in unpaired CS+ trials compared to CS- trials was most prominent in the left cerebellar hemisphere with local maxima in lobules Crus I and VI ( ). Additional activation was present in the right hemisphere (local maxima in lobules Crus I and VI) and the vermis. Vermal activation was found in the anterior vermis (lobules I-IV, V) and the posterior vermis (lobules VIIb-IX). Activation extended into the cerebellar nuclei (including dentate, interposed and fastigial nuclei bilaterally). During extinction, cerebellar activation related to the (expected) omission of the US strongly decreased. Only one smaller cluster remained in more medial parts of left Crus I ( ;  ). \n\n F  -tests revealed no significant block effects (early vs. late) neither during acquisition nor during extinction (at p<0.05 FWE corrected level, based on the TFCE statistic). The main effect of block across all four blocks (that is early and late acquisition, early and late extinction) revealed a large cluster in the left hemisphere, primarily within lobule Crus I with some extension to lobule VI and Crus II ( ;  ). As can be seen from mean   \u03b2   values across blocks (insert in  ), differential activation decreased during extinction compared to acquisition. \n\n\n##### Reanalyses of cerebellar activations \n  \nReanalyses of the three main contrasts in the acquisition phase were performed without physiological denoising (see  ) and based on un-smoothed functional data (see  ). By omitting physiological denoising as well as by omitting smoothing cerebellar activation, patterns were essentially unchanged. \n\n\n##### Comparison of cerebellar areas related to presentation, prediction and omission of the aversive stimulus \n  \nConjunction analyses were performed to reveal areas of cerebellar activation which were common to the presentation, the prediction and the (unexpected) omission of the aversive US during acquisition (based on the three differential contrasts reported above). Conjunction analyses revealed common areas of activation in the cerebellar hemispheres primarily on the left (local maximum Crus I; testing global null hypotheses at a threshold of p<0.05 FWE corrected level without TFC enhancement) ( , see also   Table 2). Additional common areas of cerebellar activation were present in the anterior and posterior vermis when considering the two contrasts related to US presentation and its unexpected omission only ( ). \n   Conjunction analyses.  \nConjunction analyses testing global null hypotheses (  a,c  ) and analyses of differences (  b,d  ) between the three contrasts \u2018US post CS+\u00a0>\u00a0no US post CS-', \u2018CS+\u00a0>\u00a0CS-\u2019 and \u2018no-US post CS+\u00a0>\u00a0no US post CS-\u2019 (shown in  ) during fear acquisition. Data in (  a,b  ) is shown in SUIT space and in (  c,d  ) in MNI space. All contrasts displayed using FWE correction (p<0.05), (  b,d  ) using TFCE. Bar graphs display group mean   \u03b2   values for each contrast considering the whole activation volume (error bars: standard error). VOI were defined based on conjunction analyses and are shown in the inserts: cerebellar VOI (  a  ) and bilateral insula VOI (  c  ).\u00a0CS\u00a0= conditioned stimulus; FWE = familywise error; TCFE = threshold-free cluster-enhancement; US = unconditioned stimulus; VOI = volumes of interest. \n\n\n \n   Comparison of cerebellar areas related to the presentation, the prediction and the omission of the aversive stimulus.  \n(  a\u2013c  ) Common areas of cerebellar activation considering any two of the three main acquisition contrasts as revealed by conjunction analyses testing global null hypothesis; (  d\u2013f  ) significant differences in activation considering any two of the three main acquisition contrasts as revealed by F-tests (using TFCE; inverse tests do not show any significant activation). All data presented at a significance level of p<0.05 FWE-corrected.\u00a0CS\u00a0= conditioned stimulus; FWE = familywise error; TCFE = threshold-free cluster-enhancement; US = unconditioned stimulus; VOI = volumes of interest. \n  \n    Psychophysiological interactions (PPI) based on a seed region in the left lateral cerebellum.  \nClusters of \u226520 mm  are shown. Up to three maxima in each cluster are shown separated by at least 8 mm. \n  \nNext, we were interested whether the level of activations differed between the three differential contrasts of interest. Using the same second level model, the main effect of contrasts was calculated (  F  -test, contrast vector: [1 -1 0; 0 1 -1]; p<0.05 FWE corrected without TFCE). Significant differences were found in the left lobule Crus I (with a small extension into lobule VI) and a small cluster in the anterior vermis (local maximum lobule I-IV) ( ,   Table 3). This difference reflected a lower level of activation related to the prediction of the aversive stimulus compared to its presentation and unexpected omission (see small insert in  ). Comparing any two out of the three contrasts at a time, revealed no significant difference in the level of activations comparing the omission and the prediction of the aversive stimulus, except a small cluster in the anterior vermis which was more prominent related to the omission of the US ( ). The level of activations of the vermis and neighboring areas of the cerebellar hemispheres were significantly higher related to the experience of the US compared to its prediction and unexpected omission ( ). \n\n\n##### Mean \u03b2 values related to each event (presentation of US, CS+, CS-, omission of US) compared to rest \n  \nBased on the conjunction analyses for the three contrasts of interest in acquisition, we defined a volume of interest (VOI) in the left cerebellar hemisphere (indicated in red in the insert in  ). Mean   \u03b2   values were calculated for each event compared to rest within the VOI. \n\nThere was no significant effect of stimulus type (CS+ or CS-) during the habituation phase (  t  \u00a0=\u00a00.86, p=0.397;  ). During acquisition, mean   \u03b2   values in CS+ trials (black triangles in  ) were significantly higher compared to CS- trials (inverted gray triangles;   F   = 14.56, p=0.001). The block (early vs. late) effect (  F   = 0.64, p=0.432) and stimulus type by block interaction (  F   = 3.96, p=0.060) effects were not significant. During extinction, mean   \u03b2   values declined in CS+ trials, and were no longer different between CS+ and CS- trials (  F   = 0.27, p=0.610). Block (  F   = 3.94, p=0.060) and stimulus type by block interaction (  F   < 0.01, p=0.973) effects were not significant. \n   Group mean   \u03b2   values related to each event (presentation of US, CS+, CS-, omission of US) compared to rest.  \n(  a  ) Volume of interest (VOI) in the left cerebellar hemisphere; (  b  ) VOI in the bilateral insula.

There were no significant block (early vs. late;   F   = 2.22, p=0.151) or stimulus type by block interaction effects (  F  \u00a0<0.01, p=0.960). Likewise, mean   \u03b2   values related to the unexpected omission of the US in CS+ trials (no-US post CS+; gray triangles) were significantly higher compared to the corresponding event in CS- trials in early (  t  \u00a0=\u00a04.38, p<0.001) and late acquisition phases (  t  \u00a0=\u00a06.73, p<0.001). During extinction, mean   \u03b2   values declined, but remained significantly higher related to no-US post CS+ events compared to no-US post CS- events (  F   = 4.52, p=0.046). The block effect (early vs. late;   F   = 8.326, p=0.009) was significant. The stimulus type by block interaction was not significant (  F   = 0.08, p=0.784). \n\n\n\n#### PPI data: cerebello-cerebral interactions \n  \nAs described above, a VOI was defined in the lateral cerebellar cortex based on conjunction analyses. Analyses of psychophysiological interactions (PPI) for the three contrasts of interest were performed between this cerebellar VOI and the whole brain. PPIs are reported which are significant at p<0.05 FWE corrected level after TFCE application. The most prominent finding was significant modulation of the functional connectivity between the cerebellum and occipital lobe during fear acquisition. There was no significant PPI found during extinction. \n\n##### PPI related to the presentation of the aversive stimulus \n  \nConsidering the seed region in the left cerebellar hemisphere, activation related to the presentation of the US (as revealed by the contrast \u201cUS post CS+\u00a0>\u00a0no US post CS-\u201c) showed increased functional connectivity with striate and extrastriate visual areas (blue-green color code in  ; see also  ; local maxima in the calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex (V1)). Additional areas of increased functional connectivity were found in limbic areas (cingulum, parahippocampus). No significant decreases of functional connectivity were found. \n   PPI analysis based on a seed region in the left lateral cerebellar cerebellum (p<0.05 FWE corrected level after TFCE application).  \nCS\u00a0= conditioned stimulus; FWE = familywise error; L =\u00a0left; PPI\u00a0= psychophysiological interaction; R =\u00a0right;\u00a0TFCE\u00a0= threshold-free cluster-enhancement; US = unconditioned stimulus; VOI = volumes of interest. \n \n   Reanalysis of PPI data to exclude \"bleed over\" from visual cortex.  \nTo exclude this possibility, data were reanalyzed using the mean signal modulation in the occipital lobe as first level nuisance regressor in analogy to the method applied by   (  b  ). For comparison, data of the original analysis are\u00a0shown in (  a  ), which is identical to   in the main manuscript. Note that the main results did not change, that is functional connectivity of the cerebellum was increased with visual cortical areas when comparing CS+ with CS- trials. Data are\u00a0shown at p<0.05 FWE corrected level after TFCE application. CS\u00a0= conditioned stimulus; FWE = familywise error; L =\u00a0left;\u00a0PPI\u00a0= psychophysiological interaction; R =\u00a0right;\u00a0TFCE\u00a0= threshold-free cluster-enhancement; US = unconditioned stimulus; VOI = volumes of interest. \n  \n \n\n##### PPI related to prediction of the aversive stimulus \n  \nCerebellar activation in the hemispherical seed region related to prediction of the aversive stimulus (as revealed by the contrast 'CS+\u00a0>\u00a0CS-') showed increased functional connectivity with extrastriate visual areas (local maxima in middle occipital lobe, lingual gyrus, fusiform gyrus; red-yellow color code in  ;  ). No significant decreases of functional connectivity were found. \n\n\n##### PPI related to the (unexpected) omission of the aversive stimulus \n  \nCerebellar activation in the hemispherical seed region related to the (unexpected) omission of the aversive US (as revealed by the contrast 'no-US post CS+\u00a0>\u00a0no US post CS-') showed no significant increases or decreases of functional connectivity. \n\n\n##### \u2018Bleed over\u2019 from visual cortex \n  \nTo exclude the possibility that the observed functional connectivity between cerebellum and occipital cortex was driven by \u2018bleed over\u2019 from visual cortex, data were reanalyzed using the mean signal modulation in the occipital lobe as first level nuisance regressor (see  ), for details). The main findings did not change (see  ). \n\n\n\n#### Whole brain analysis \n  \nAlthough the focus of the study was on the cerebellum, exploratory whole brain fMRI analysis was also performed. Data are\u00a0presented at p<0.05 FWE corrected level after TFCE application in all cases but conjunction analysis. Conjunction analysis results are reported at the level of p<0.05 FWE without TFCE. Most prominent activation was observed within the insula ( ). Activation of other limbic areas was observed, primarily related to presentation of the aversive stimulus. Similar to cerebellar activation, prominent activation of the insula was observed not only to the prediction of the upcoming US but also related to its unexpected omission during acquisition trials. Cerebral activations vanished during extinction trials (at p<0.05 FWE corrected level after TFCE). \n\n##### Cerebral activation related to the presentation of the aversive stimulus [contrast 'US post CS+\u00a0>\u00a0no US post CS-'] \n  \nMost prominent activations were found in the insula bilaterally ( ). Additional differential activations were present in the anterior and middle cingulate gyrus, the amygdala, supplementary motor area (SMA), supramarginal and superior temporal gyrus bilaterally, frontal inferior gyrus and cuneus (summarized in   Table 5). \n\n\n##### Cerebral related to the prediction of the aversive stimulus [contrast \u2018CS+\u00a0>\u00a0CS-'] \n  \nDuring acquisition, cerebral activation related to the CS+ was significantly higher compared to the CS- in the more anterior parts of the insula bilaterally ( ;   Table 5). Additional differential activation was present in the right SMA and middle cingulate gyrus. During extinction, no significant fMRI activation was observed. \n\n\n##### Cerebral activation related to the omission of the aversive stimulus [contrast \u2018no-US post CS+\u00a0>\u00a0no US post CS-'] \n  \nDuring acquisition, significant differential activation related to the (unexpected) omission of the US was found in more anterior parts of the insula bilaterally ( ,   Table 5). Additional activation was found bilaterally in the SMA, anterior and medial cingulate and right supramarginal cortex. During extinction, no significant activations were observed. \n\n\n##### Comparison of cerebellar areas related to presentation, prediction and omission of the aversive stimulus \n  \nConjunction analyses revealed that the more anterior parts of the insula bilaterally were activated in the three contrasts of interest (testing the global null hypotheses at a threshold of p<0.05 FWE corrected level without TFC enhancement) ( , see also   Table 2). In the anterior, but also posterior, parts of the insula, the level of activations differed between the three differential contrasts of interest (  F  -tests; p<0.05 FWE corrected without TFC enhancement;  ,  Table 3). This difference reflected a higher level of activation related to the experience of the aversive stimulus compared to its prediction and unexpected omission (see small insert in  ). \n\n\n##### Mean \u03b2-values in the bilateral insula related to each event (presentation of US, CS+, CS-, omission of US) compared to rest \n  \nA VOI was defined in the bilateral insula based on conjunction analyses considering the three contrasts of interest as described above and a (bilateral) insula mask derived from the AAL template (see insert in  ). \n\nThere was no significant effect of stimulus type (CS+ or CS-) during the habituation phase (  t  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.28, p=0.781;  ). During acquisition, mean   \u03b2   values in CS+ trials (black triangles in  ) were significantly higher than in CS- trials (inverted gray triangles;   F   = 22.13, p<0.001). The block effect (early vs. late;   F   = 0.89, p=0.355) and stimulus type by block interaction (  F   = 0.123, p=0.730) effects were not significant. During extinction, mean   \u03b2   values in CS+ trials declined. The block effect was significant (  F   = 7.58, p=0.012). Stimulus type (  F   = 2.74, p=0.113) and stimulus type by block interaction effects (  F   = 0.41, p=0.530) were not significant. \n\nMean   \u03b2   values in the bilateral insula VOI were significantly higher in response to the presentation of the aversive US in paired CS+ trials (US post CS+; black diamonds in  ) compared to the corresponding event in CS- trials (no-US post CS-; inverted black triangles) (  F   = 43.71, p<0.001). The block effect was significant (early vs. late;   F   = 10.07, p=0.005). The stimulus type by block interaction was not significant (  F  \u00a0<0.01, p=0.991). Likewise, mean   \u03b2   values related to the unexpected omission of the US in CS+ trials (no-US post CS+; gray triangles) were significantly higher compared to the CS- trials in early (  t  \u00a0=\u00a04.53, p<0.001) and late acquisition (  t  \u00a0=\u00a05.97, p<0.001). During extinction, mean   \u03b2   values at the time of the presentation of the US in CS+ trials declined. Stimulus type effect was significant (  F   = 4.49, p=0.046). Block (  F   = 3.87, p=0.063) and stimulus type by block interaction (  F   = 0.97, p=0.335) effects were not significant. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nCerebellar activation was observed related to the learned association of the CS and the aversive US confirming previous results ( ;  ;  ). Most importantly, marked cerebellar activation was found also during the unexpected omission of the unpleasant event and disappeared during extinction trials (in which the omission became expected). These findings support the hypothesis that the cerebellum acts as or is part of a predictive device not only in the motor\u00a0domain, but also in the emotional domain. In addition to the cerebellum, exploratory whole brain analysis showed very similar patterns of activation in the insula, which has been shown to be involved in aversive prediction error processing by others ( ;  ). Thus, first evidence was found that the cerebellum is part of a more extended neural network processing prediction errors in learned emotional responses. The discussion will focus on the cerebellar findings, which were also accompanied by changes in functional connectivity predominantly with visual cortices. Hence, one cerebellar role in emotional control may be to modulate processing of fear-related sensory information. \n\n### Cerebellar activation during presentation and prediction of aversive events \n  \nCerebellar activation during presentation and prediction of aversive events is in good accordance with the literature ( ;  ;  ;  ). In a seminal study,   reported that distinct, but closely adjacent, cerebellar areas were related to the experience and the prediction of pain. In accordance, we found activation of the anterior cerebellum with a maximum in the cerebellar vermis related to presentation of the aversive stimulus. Different to  , however, cerebellar activation related to the experience of the US showed a significant extension to the posterolateral cerebellum (including lobules Crus I and VI) and overlapped with the area related to the prediction of the aversive stimulus. Furthermore, the level of activation in the posterolateral cerebellum was more related to the experience of the aversive stimulus compared to its prediction. Likewise, other fMRI studies have reported that aversive stimuli result in more widespread cerebellar activations of both anteromedial and posterolateral areas (painful electrical stimulation of the feet:  ; airpuffs directed to the eye:  ;  ,\u00a0for\u00a0review). Responses to aversive stimuli are complex and involve autonomic, sensorimotor, cognitive, and higher-order emotional reactions. Parts of the vermis are known to contribute to autonomic functions\u00a0( ;\u00a0 ,\u00a0for reviews) and emotion processing tasks ( , but see also  ), the anterior lobe, part of lobule VI and lobule VIII to sensorimotor functions, and Crus I and II as well as part of lobule VI to cognitive functions ( ;  ;  ). Lobules VI, Crus II and X have also been related to emotional processes ( ). Thus, different parts of the cerebellum likely contribute to the various aspects involved in processing of aversive stimuli ( ). \n\nVery similar to our findings, a more recent fMRI study also reported an overlap of cerebellar areas related to the experience and prediction of painful stimuli in Crus I and lobule VI of the posterolateral cerebellum ( ). Nevertheless, we suggest a different interpretation of the data from\u00a0 : rather than reflecting a dissociation between the experience and the prediction of unpleasant events, different parts of the cerebellum are likely involved in the different aspects of learned fear. For example, midline parts of the cerebellum are likely involved in autonomic processes, and posterolateral parts of the cerebellum in cognitive and higher-order emotional processes related to the experience and prediction of potentially harmful stimuli. The known motor areas also likely contribute to this picture. Depending on stimulus intensity, participants may withdraw their hand or at least prepare a hand movement. In fact, early animal, but also human cerebellar lesion studies highlight the involvement of the cerebellar vermis in the conditioning of autonomic fear responses ( ;  \u00a0for\u00a0reviews;  ;  ;  ). For example,   found that fear-conditioned bradycardia was impaired in patients with lesions of the cerebellar midline but not the lateral cerebellar hemispheres. On the other hand, activation of the posterolateral cerebellar hemisphere is very common in human fear conditioning fMRI studies ( ). Given the known reciprocal connections of the posterolateral cerebellum and its output nuclei, the dentate nuclei, with the prefrontal cortex ( ;  ), lateral activations may reflect the more cognitive aspects of fear conditioning. Contingency awareness may play a critical role: a prerequisite for conditioned fear responses to occur is that participants become aware of the CS-US contingencies ( ;  ; for reviews;  ;  ). Contingency awareness is likely linked to working memory processes ( ). In fact, cerebellar activation in lobules VI and Crus I overlaps with areas in the cerebellum which have been shown to contribute to working memory processes (e.g.  ;  , although in their study \u2018active maintenance\u2019 was lateralized to the right; and visual working memory was localized in the vermis). If this assumption is true, the pattern of cerebellar activation should be different in aware and unaware participants. It will be of high interest to test this hypothesis in future studies, for\u00a0example using multiple CSs ( ) or using distractor tasks (e.g.  ;  ) to prevent awareness of the CS-US contingencies. \n\nIn the present study, the focus of activation was within Crus I with some extension into lobule VI. Although it cannot be excluded that part of the activation is related to the preparation or subliminal execution of a withdrawal movement, motor-related processes are unlikely to explain the bulk of posterolateral activation. Hand and finger movements result in fMRI activation of ipsilateral lobule V, with additional activation of lobule VI bilaterally in more complex movements ( ;  ). Although some extension to Crus I has been observed in the latter, movements never result in activations primarily of Crus I. Rather, focus of activation is always on lobules V and VI, which was clearly not the case in the present study. Of note, preparation and execution of movements have been found to activate the same cerebellar areas ( ). \n\nThe present findings agree with the classic view that prediction depends on activity in the same networks that process the actual experience (e.g.  ), at least at the level of the cerebellum. Recent single-cell recording studies within the cerebellar cortex in monkeys are also in line with this assumption: both simple and complex spike firing rates at the same Purkinje cell encode movement kinematics and sensory feedback, but also motor predictions ( ;  ;  ). \n\nBased on animal and human lesion data, vermal activation is to be expected related to the prediction of the aversive stimulus. A recent fMRI meta-analysis indeed showed activations of both the cerebellar hemispheres and the vermis in fear conditioning paradigms in healthy humans ( ). This was, however, neither the case in the present study nor in the study by  . Because participants were instructed about the CS-US contingencies to a certain degree in both studies, the cognitive component may have had the strongest impact on the fMRI data. \n\n reported a similar dissociation for the experience and the prediction of pain in posterior and anterior parts of the insula, respectively. In the present study, we also found activation related to the US in the posterior insula, and activation related to the CS+ (and therefore prediction of the US) in more anterior parts. Very similar to our cerebellar findings, however, US-related activation extended into the more anterior insula and overlapped with CS+ related activations. Again, we hypothesize that this is not a dissociation between experience and prediction but reflects different functional aspects of processing of potentially harmful stimuli. For example,   suggested that posterior parts of the insula may be more important in the evaluation of the intensity and localization of an aversive stimulus, whereas the anterior insula may process the emotional reaction to the stimulus. However, as yet, the anterior insula, but not the posterior insula has been shown to be involved in processing predictions of aversive events ( ). Notwithstanding, this concept may also be extended to other brain areas, for\u00a0example. the medial and anterior cingulate cortex ( ). In the present study, however, no other cerebral regions showed significant activations related to the prediction of the aversive stimulus in the whole brain analysis using a conservative statistical threshold. \n\nIt should be noted that a nonselective analysis of cerebellar (and cerebral) activations has been performed, that is interpretation of specific regional activations has been done a posteriori. Another approach would comprise a selective analysis of (a priori) functionally defined ROIs based on the recent studies mapping the cerebellum to a broad range of functions ( ;  ). As yet, however, there are important open questions regarding cerebellar areas involved in emotions. The emotional area described by   is based on one single task, not on a meta-analysis of a significant number of different emotional tasks. In the\u00a0study\u00a0by  , more tasks included emotional processing. However, emotional processing did not become part of any of the 10\u00a0main functional regions of the cerebellum introduced by the authors. Furthermore, they found that vermal activation was best explained by eye movements (or visual attention), but not emotional processing as reported by  . Thus, as yet, a nonselective analysis gives a more unbiased picture of cerebellar regions involved in fear conditioning. We do acknowledge, however, that this approach allows only limited conclusions on the possible contributions of selective cerebellar areas to learned fear responses. \n\n\n### Cerebellar activation during the unexpected omission of predicted aversive events \n  \nWe found cerebellar activation related to the predicted occurrence of an aversive US. More prominent cerebellar activations, however, were observed during the unexpected omission of the unpleasant event. Cerebellar activation was most marked in the posterolateral cerebellum (lobules Crus I, VI), but additional activations were also present in the vermis. Importantly, cerebellar activation vanished during extinction trials, during which the omission of the US became expected. These findings support the hypothesis that the cerebellum is involved in encoding and/or processing of prediction errors. The present findings are supported by earlier findings ( ) reporting activations of the posterolateral cerebellar hemisphere in the very first extinction trial in an associative learning task using painful heat stimuli as US. Our findings are also very similar to findings in a recent fMRI study on the cerebellar contributions to language ( ): Activation of the posterolateral cerebellum (Crus I and II) was related to the predictability of upcoming words in a sentence (e.g., two plus two is   four  ). Similar to the present findings, prominent cerebellar activation was also observed when this prediction was violated (e.g., two plus two is   apple  ). In the sensorimotor domain, fMRI data in humans also show cerebellar activation related to the unexpected omission of an expected sensory stimulus ( ;  ). \n\nBased on theoretical models it has long been assumed that error information is sent to the cerebellar cortex via the climbing fibers ( ;  ). Climbing fibers have been shown to signal the unexpected occurrence and the unexpected omission of the airpuff-US in eyeblink conditioning in mice and rabbits (see  , for a recent study): Whereas the unexpected occurrence leads to an increase of climbing fiber activity, the unexpected omission results in a decrease. Because the fMRI signal is thought to reflect synaptic activity ( ), decrease of climbing fiber input cannot explain the observed increased fMRI signal in the cerebellar cortex during US omission. Prediction errors, however, may not only be signaled by the climbing fiber system. There is also evidence that mossy fibers play a role ( ;  ). Furthermore, the role of the cerebellum may go beyond the processing of sensory predictions and sensory prediction errors and may include reward predictions and prediction errors ( ;  ).   found granule cells that responded preferentially to reward, to reward omission and reward anticipation, a function commonly ascribed to the dopaminergic system ( ;  ). Importantly, reward omission granule cells were significantly more frequent than reward cells. In addition to sensory and reward prediction errors, the cerebellum may be involved in prediction of punishment and punishment prediction errors. As outlined in the introduction, several brain areas are likely involved in the processing of predictions and prediction errors in associative fear learning. As yet, it is unknown where prediction errors of learned fear responses are encoded ( ). Because there is some experimental evidence that sensory prediction errors are encoded in the cerebellar cortex and nuclei ( ;  ;  ), the cerebellum is a likely candidate. However, this issue is far from being settled and extracerebellar areas may also play a role. \n\n\n### Changes in connectivity between the cerebellum and visual cortex \n  \nFunctional connectivity of the cerebellum was increased with visual cortical areas when comparing CS+ with CS- trials and with limbic areas during presentation of the US, but not during its prediction. Likewise,   found that visual cortex processing plays a more central role and that limbic areas become functionally decoupled in a fear conditioning paradigm. Increased connectivity between the cerebellum and visual cortex suggests that the cerebellum contributes to the known enhancement of the perception of visual stimuli during fear conditioning ( ). \n\nHowever, at first sight, increased connectivity between the cerebellum and visual cortex is unexpected. In monkeys, the primary visual cortex has no known afferent connections with the cerebellum ( ;  ). Likewise, resting state fMRI revealed no functional connectivity between the cerebellum and primary visual cortex in a large study population ( ). Rather, the cerebellum receives dense afferent connections from the dorsal stream of parietal lobe visual areas ( ;  ) and is known to increase visual perception of movements (e.g.,  ;  ). The influence of the cerebellum on the perception of fear-conditioned visual stimuli may be indirect: enhanced processing of fear conditioned visual stimuli in the visual cortex has been shown to be under the control of cortical structures, in particular the middle frontal gyrus (MFG;  ). Bidirectional cerebello-frontal connections are known for the frontal eye field and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which play an important role in attention ( ). Possibly, the cerebellum may help to increase selective attention to the CS. The present findings, however, are based on PPI, which do not give any information about directionality. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nThe most important present finding is the pronounced cerebellar activation during the unexpected omission of a predicted aversive stimulus. This cerebellar activation is best explained by the generation or further processing of prediction errors. As expected, cerebellar activation was also found during the prediction of aversive stimuli. These findings support the hypothesis that the cerebellum is of general importance for predictive control including the emotional domain. The cerebellum has to be added to the more extended neural network involved in processing of aversive predictions and prediction errors. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nExperiment power was estimated based on previous eyeblink conditioning data, which had also been acquired at 7 T ( ) using the fmriPower toolbox for MATLAB (fmripower.org;  ). Considering CS-only trials in acquisition and aiming for a power of 80% at p<0.001, group sizes were estimated to 21 participants for lobule VI and 30 participants for Crus I ipsilaterally to US application. \n\nA total of 27 young and healthy participants performed the experiment. Three participants had to be excluded because\u00a0of\u00a0technical errors, one participant because\u00a0of an incidental finding on brain MRI, and one participant because\u00a0of constant motion throughout MRI acquisition. Thus, a total of 22 participants (eight males, 14 females, mean age: 26.9 (SD\u00a0=\u00a04.3) years, range: 19\u201332 years) were included in the final data analysis. None of the participants presented with neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders based on medical history. None were taking centrally\u00a0acting drugs, except two who were taking a low dosage of a corticosteroid and an antihistamine, respectively. All participants were right-handed based on the Edinburgh handedness inventory ( ) and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. They were asked to refrain from alcohol consumption the night before the experiment. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Fear conditioning \n  \nThe entire experiment was performed within one session inside the MRI scanner. The paradigm presentation was controlled by a computer running the software Presentation (version 16.4, Neurobehavioral System Inc, Berkeley, CA).   displays the experimental paradigm. Participants were shown images of the visual stimuli used in the experiment and told that electrical shocks would be applied during the experiment. They were instructed that, should they perceive a pattern between CS and US presentations, the experimenter would not change it during the experiment. \n\nVisual stimuli were projected onto a rear projection screen inside the scanner bore using a standard projector. Images were visible to the participants through a mirror mounted on the radiofrequency (RF) head coil. Two pictures of black-and-white geometric figures (a square and a diamond shape, that\u00a0is the square tilted by 45\u00b0) of identical brightness were used as CS+ and CS- (time of presentation: 8\u00a0s). In reinforced CS+ trials (i.e. 10 out of 16 acquisition trials), the visual stimulus co-terminated with the presentation of the aversive US. In CS- trials, the visual stimulus was never followed by the aversive US. A neutral black background image was displayed in between visual stimulus presentations (ITI randomized between 16 s and 20 s). Use of the two figures as CS+ and CS- was pseudorandomly counterbalanced between the individual participants. \n\nA short electrical stimulation was used as an aversive US. The electrical stimulation was generated by a constant current stimulator (DS7A, Digitimer Ltd., London, UK) and applied to the left hand via a concentric (ring-shaped) bipolar surface electrode with 6 mm conductive diameter and a central platinum pin (WASP electrode, Specialty Developments, Bexley, UK). For MR-safety reasons, an in-house build non-magnetic high-resistivity electrode lead was used to connect the stimulator with the surface electrode ( ). The 100 ms US consisted of a short train of four consecutive 500 \u00b5s current pulses (maximum output voltage: 400 V) with an inter pulse interval of 33 ms. Immediately before the\u00a0start of MRI measurements, the\u00a0stimulation current was gradually increased, and participants were asked to report on the perceived sensation intensity until an \u2018unpleasant but not painful\u2019 intensity was reached (mean current: 3.9 (SD\u00a0=\u00a02.3) mA, range 1.6\u20139.3 mA). The final individual current setting was kept constant for all stimulations. Stimulus timing was set for the US to co-terminate with visual CS+ presentation. \n\nDuring the experiment three types of trials were presented to the participants: CS+ followed by an US (paired CS+/US trial), CS+ without an US (CS+ only trial) and CS- without US (CS- only trial). The experimental protocol consisted of the three phases: \u2018habituation\u2019 (four CS+ only trials, four CS- only trials, presented in alternating order), \u2018acquisition\u2019 (10 paired CS+/US trials, six CS+ only trials, 16 CS- only trials) and \u2018extinction\u2019 (16 CS+ trials, 16 CS- only trials). Different trial types in acquisition and extinction were presented in a pseudorandomized order with four restrictions: firstly, the first two trials of acquisition were set to be paired CS+/US trials; secondly, there were never more than two consecutive CS of one kind presented in a row; thirdly, during acquisition and extinction the number of events of each kind was kept identical in the first half and in the second half of the experiment; and fourthly, the very last trial of acquisition was set to be a paired CS+/US trial. During acquisition, the order of events was the same for all participants, while use of the two different figures as CS+ and CS- was counterbalanced across the whole group. Order of CS+ and CS- events was counterbalanced during extinction (12 starting with CS+, 10 starting with CS-), and habituation (15 starting with CS+, seven starting with CS-). Each experimental phase was performed within a separate block of fMRI data acquisition. \n\nOf note, fear conditioning in both animals and humans are commonly done with long CS-US intervals because measures of autonomic fear responses evolve slowly. Different to eyeblink conditioning, fear conditioning is tolerant to these long CS-US periods ( ;  ). This allows performance\u00a0of event-related fMRI studies, which can separate between CS-related activation, US-related activation, and activation related to the omission of the US. Both animal ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and human studies ( ) have shown that the cerebellar vermis is involved in fear conditioning \u2013 despite these long CS-US time intervals. The contribution of the cerebellum to discrete somatic motor behavior (such as eyeblink responses) may be different compared to slowly reacting autonomic responses. \n\n\n### Questionnaires \n  \nParticipants were required to answer three questionnaires, one before the start of the experiment, a second one in between acquisition phase and extinction phase, and a third questionnaire after the experiment. The first and the third questionnaires were print copies handed out to the participant. The second questionnaire was projected onto the screen inside the MRI scanner bore one question at a time and answers were given orally via an intercom system. \n\nParticipants were asked to rate their (hedonic) valence and (emotional) arousal on viewing images of the CS+ and CS- on a nine-step Likert scale from \u2018very unpleasant\u2019 to \u2018very pleasant\u2019 and \u2018quiet and relaxed\u2019 to \u2018very excited\u2019, respectively. Additionally, the questionnaire following acquisition contained five questions regarding US perception and CS-US contingency: rating of the last US on a nine step-scale (\u2018not unpleasant\u2019 to \u2018very unpleasant\u2019); a multiple-choice question and a percentage estimate whether the US was applied after the presentation of the square and the diamond-shaped CS (options: \u2018always\u2019, \u2018sometimes\u2019, \u2018never\u2019, \u2018I cannot answer\u2019); and lastly an estimation after which time and number of US presentations, if at all, a connection between the visual stimuli and the US presentation was identified. \n\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (Version 24, RRID: , IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Using repeated measure analyses of variance (ANOVA) valence and arousal ratings were tested for within-subject effects of stimulus type (CS+ vs. CS-) and phase (pre-acquisition, post-acquisition vs. post-extinction). Where necessary, individual ratings were compared with post\u00a0hoc   t  -tests. \n\n\n### Physiological data acquisition \n  \nPhysiological data measured throughout the experiment were SCR, pulse rate and breathing rate. SC was acquired using a physiological data acquisition station with a dedicated MRI-compatible SC module and appropriate hardware filters sampling at 2 kHz (EDA 100C-MRI, BIOPAC Systems Inc, Goleta, CA). SC electrodes were attached to the participants' left middle and ring fingers. \n\nPulse rate and breathing rate were measured using the physiologic monitoring unit (PMU) provided by the MRI scanner (Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) at a fixed sampling rate of 50 Hz. In detail, pulse oximetry signals were recorded using a wireless recording device clipped to the participant\u2019s right index finger. A respiratory bellows was attached to the participant's lower abdomen using a hook-and-loop belt. Of note, pulse and breathing data were used to perform physiological denoising of MRI data only ( ). The low sampling rate as well as the broad peaks of the pulse curves did not allow for the accuracy needed to observe small peak-to-peak heart rate variations related to fear conditioning. \n\n\n### Skin conductance analysis \n  \nTo eliminate high-frequency noise and low-frequency drifts, SC data were bandpass filtered (\u221261 dB Blackman FIR filter, 0.5 to 10 Hz) using AcqKnowledge software (BIOPAC Systems Inc, Goleta, CA). All further SC data processing was performed using MATLAB software (Release 2017a, RRID: , The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA). Semi-automated peak detection was performed, and SCR were defined as the maximum trough-to-peak-amplitude of any SCR peak within a given time interval. In each trial, SCR were evaluated for three distinct time windows ( ): the FIR within a time window of 1.0 s to 5.0 s after CS onset, the SIR within a time window of 5.0 s to 8.5 s after CS onset, and the unconditioned response window (i.e. TIR) 8.5\u201313.0 s after CS onset (irrespective\u00a0of whether a US was presented in the particular trial or not) ( ). To normalize data, SCR values were increased by 1 \u00b5S and logarithmized ( ;  ). Mean SCR values were calculated grouped for blocks of four,\u00a0five, six and eight events, corresponding to the first\u00a0level regressor selection in MRI analysis. \n\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (Version 24, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). ANOVA with repeated measures were calculated for within subject effects of stimulus type (CS+ vs. CS-) and block (early vs. late) considering SCR values as dependent measure. Appropriate post\u00a0hoc   t  -tests were calculated. Because there was only one block of unpaired CS+ trials in acquisition (see  ), differences of TIR in unpaired CS+ trials with TIR in paired CS+ and CS- trials were analyzed using   t  -tests. \n\n\n### MRI acquisition \n  \nAll MR images were acquired with the participants lying supine inside a whole-body MRI system operating at 7 Tesla magnetic field strength (MAGNETOM 7T, Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a one-channel transmit/32 channel receive RF head coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA). To homogenize the RF excitation field (B1), three dielectric pads filled with high-permittivity fluid were placed below and on either side of each participant's upper neck ( ). As needed, further cushions were used to fix the head position within the RF coil. \n\nPrior to fMRI acquisition a sagittal MP2RAGE sequence ( ;  ) was run to acquire whole-brain anatomical reference images with an isotropic voxel size of 0.75 mm. Further imaging parameters were set as follows: TR/TE, 6000/3.45 ms, TI1/TI2, 800/2700 ms, flip angles 1/2, 4\u00b0/5\u00b0, parallel acceleration factor, 3, phase and slice partial Fourier factor, 6/8, acquisition matrix, 320\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0300, number of slices, 192, TA, 9:40 min. \n\nWhole brain functional fMRI acquisition was performed using a fat-saturated, two-dimensional simultaneous multi slice echo planar image (SMS-EPI) sequence ( ;  ) with an isotropic voxel size of 1.7 mm, in three consecutive episodes for habituation (90 volumes), acquisition and extinction (320 volumes each). Imaging parameters were selected as follows: TR/TE, 2000/22 ms, flip angle, 70\u00b0, parallel acceleration factor, 2, SMS factor, 3, phase partial Fourier factor, 6/8, acquisition matrix, 130\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0130, number of slices, 90. \n\n\n### Image processing \n  \nAll image and fMRI analyses were performed using SPM 12 (RRID: , Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) on a platform running MATLAB on Mac OS X 10.12.6, if not explicitly stated otherwise. SPM default brightness threshold was set from 0.8 to 0.1 to avoid signal dropouts within the hypointense cerebellar nuclei ( ). \n\nFunctional MRI volumes for each participant were corrected for slice timing and realigned to the first volume of the habituation phase. One mean functional volume per participant was calculated. \n\nBrain extraction was performed on non-denoised uniform T1 weighted (UNI) volumes using the CBS tools for high-resolution processing of high-field brain MRI ( ). Best coregistration of the mean functional volume to the brain extracted structural volume was achieved using the function \u2018epi_reg\u2019 available in FSL (Release 5.0.10, RRID: , Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain, Oxford, UK). Coregistration was subsequently applied to all functional volumes of each respective participant. \n\nNormalization of the cerebellum was performed using the SUIT-toolbox for SPM (version 3.1, RRID: ). Using the spatially unbiased atlas template of the human cerebellum ( ), brain-extracted structural volumes were segmented and cerebellar masks were generated. Manual correction of each mask was performed by an experienced technician using MRIcron software (RRID: ,  ) and slightly smoothed with an isotropic smoothing kernel of 1.5 mm (and subsequently thresholded against a value of 0.5) to remove remnant single outlying voxels. Using this process, on average 6.2% (SD 2.0%) of voxels (predominantly in the anterior region) were removed from, and 3.6% (SD 1.3%) of voxels (mainly in the dorsal region) were added to the cerebellar masks. The segmented structural images and the cortical cerebellar mask were supplied to a region of interest (ROI)-based DARTEL normalization algorithm available within the SUIT toolbox, and a cerebellar normalization was calculated. In addition, whole-brain normalization to MNI-space was obtained using the SPM segment routine. Functional volumes were then separately normalized to SUIT space using the corrected cerebellar mask from SUIT segmentation and MNI space (whole brain). All normalized volumes were subsequently smoothed by an isotropic smoothing kernel of 4 mm. \n\n\n### fMRI analysis \n  \nWe focused our fMRI analysis on the cerebellum. In addition, exploratory analysis of the whole brain was performed. The first\u00a0level analysis was modelled as an event related-design. All US, no-US and CS event regressors were modelled for the respective stimulus onset and all the respective durations were set to 0 s. The first five volumes of each fMRI run were disregarded. Events were blocked into 19 regressors of interest as displayed in  . If number of trials allowed (n\u00a0\u2265\u00a04), events of each kind were grouped in two equal-sized blocks representing the first (early) and the second (late) half of each phase. Regressors were chosen for CS+ and CS- during habituation (two regressors, four events each), CS+ and CS- presentations during acquisition and extinction (eight regressors, eight events each), US presentations during acquisition (two regressors, five events each), and the omission of US presentations (no-US) at the expected time of US presentations after CS onset (no-US post CS+: one regressor, six events during acquisition, two regressors, eight events each during extinction; no-US post CS-: four regressors, eight events each during acquisition and extinction). \n\nTo correct for motion, volume realignment parameters were prepared as six nuisance regressors (three translations and three rotations). Pulse oximetry and respiration data from PMU were processed using essential features of the PhLEM toolbox for SPM ( ). To correct for physiological motion effects the RETROICOR (retrospective image-based correction) method was applied and eight regressors were generated ( ), resulting in a total of 14 nuisance regressors for each fMRI run. To ensure that no significant information was lost as a result of physiological denoising, an additional analysis with motion regressors but without RETROICOR was performed. Similarly, to ensure that no fine details were lost as a result of smoothing, a further analysis was performed using the normalized, un-smoothed functional data. \n\nFirst level main effect contrasts against rest and differential first level contrasts were generated and tested in second level   t  -tests. The contrast \u2018US post CS+\u00a0>\u00a0no US post CS-\u2019 was calculated to reveal activation in response to the presentation of the aversive stimulus (US). The contrast \u2018CS+\u00a0>\u00a0CS-\u2019 was calculated to reveal activation related to the prediction of the US. Finally, the contrast \u2018no-US post CS+>no US post CS-\u2019 was calculated to reveal activation related to the omission of the US. For second level   t  -tests, first level differential contrasts for acquisition and extinction phase were collapsed over early and late blocks, respectively. Contrasts were never collapsed across experimental phases. To evaluate differences between early and late acquisition and extinction, individual second level within-subject ANOVA were modelled for the contrasts 'CS+\u00a0>\u00a0CS-' and \u201cno-US post CS+\u00a0>\u00a0no US post CS-', and (for acquisition only) for the contrast 'US post CS+\u00a0>\u00a0no US post CS-'. TFCE was applied using the TFCE toolbox for SPM12 (R164 and R174,  ). \n\nIn addition, second level one-way ANOVA was modeled for the three main acquisition contrasts (considering early and late acquisition together). To identify regions of shared activation, conjunction analysis ( ) was performed to test global null hypotheses for each of the three contrasts. Using the same second level model,\u00a0the main effect of contrast was calculated to assess differences between the three contrasts (  F  -test, contrast vector: [1 -1 0; 0 1 -1]). \n\nPPI were modelled for the whole brain analysis ( ) using cerebellar VOI based on conjunction analysis in SUIT space as seed regions. TFCE was applied on the results. Additionally, region mean   \u03b2   values for selected VOIs were extracted from simple first level   \u03b2   maps against rest and compared between CS and US events using ANOVA and paired   t  -tests. To exclude the possibility that the observed functional connectivity between cerebellum and occipital cortex was driven by \u2018bleed over\u2019 from visual cortex, PPI was reanalyzed using the mean signal modulation in the section of occipital lobe closer than 6 mm to the cerebellum as first level nuisance regressor, in analogy to the work performed by  . \n\nActivation maps were masked in SUIT space using the SUIT atlas volume (Cerebellum-SUIT.nii) with the inner-cerebellar white matter manually filled in, and in MNI space using the SPM canonical inner-cranial volume mask (mask_ICV.nii). To display results, cerebellar (SUIT space) activation maps were projected on cerebellar flatmaps ( ). Whole brain MNI space activation maps were projected on MNI152 average T1 volume provided with SPM (icbm_avg_152_t1_tal_lin.nii). To acquire anatomical region labels, maps were then projected onto the SUIT atlas volume (Cerebellum-SUIT.nii,  ) and the automated anatomical labeling (AAL)\ufeff atlas volume (AAL.nii, RRID: ,  ), respectively. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6715348, "text_md5": "d5ba849b592346c0f22fe69256a1b64b", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 211], "journal": [212, 217], "publication_year": [219, 223], "title": [234, 343], "keywords": [357, 439], "abstract": [452, 1478], "body": [1487, 69585]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 31464686, "doi": "10.7554/eLife.46831", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6715348", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6715348"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6715348\">6715348</a>", "list_title": "PMC6715348  The cerebellum is involved in processing of predictions and prediction errors in a fear conditioning paradigm"}
{"text": "Konishi, Mahiko and McLaren, Donald George and Engen, Haakon and Smallwood, Jonathan\nPLoS One, 2015\n\n# Title\n\nShaped by the Past: The Default Mode Network Supports Cognition that Is Independent of Immediate Perceptual Input\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nAlthough many different accounts of the functions of the default mode network (DMN) have been proposed, few can adequately account for the spectrum of different cognitive functions that utilize this network. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the hypothesis that the role of the DMN in higher order cognition is to allow cognition to be shaped by information from stored representations rather than information in the immediate environment. Using a novel task paradigm, we observed   increased   BOLD activity in regions of the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex when individuals made decisions on the location of shapes from the prior trial and   decreased   BOLD activity when individuals made decisions on the location of shapes on the current trial. These data are inconsistent with views of the DMN as a task-negative system or one that is sensitive only to stimuli with strong personal or emotional ties. Instead the involvement of the DMN when people make decisions about where a shape was, rather than where it is now, supports the hypothesis that the core hubs of the DMN allow cognition to be guided by information other than the immediate perceptual input. We propose that a variety of different forms of higher order thought (such as imagining the future or considering the perspective of another person) engage the DMN because these more complex introspective forms of higher order thought all depend on the capacity for cognition to be shaped by representations that are not present in the external environment. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nUnderstanding the function of the   default mode network (DMN)   has become an important question in cognitive neuroscience [ ]. This core brain network, focused on hubs in both the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), was initially identified via meta-analysis because of its tendency to deactivate during tasks that demand external focus [ ]. Since then functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that these regions show patterns of temporally correlated activity during the resting state [ ] and comparative studies have identified an analogue of the DMN in many species including rats [ ], chimpanzees [ ] and macaques [ ]. Developmental studies have shown this network matures relatively late in life in humans [ ] and degeneration within key structures of the DMN occurs with age and is particularly prevalent in dementias such as Alzheimer\u2019s Disease [ , ]. \n\nSuch evidence indicates that the DMN plays an important functional role in cognition [ ]. Task based studies suggest the DMN is involved in a wide variety of cognitive functions including semantic processing [ ], thinking about oneself [ ], imagining one\u2019s future [ \u2013 ], encoding and retrieving episodic memories [ ], retrieving autobiographical memories [ , ], considering the world from the perspective of another person [ , ] and thinking creatively about a problem [ \u2013 ] (for quantitative meta analyses see [ \u2013 ]). \n\nThe large number of functions utilizing the DMN has generated several hypotheses of this networks function. For example, the association between DMN and states of personally relevant processing has led to the suggestion that it supports information important for the autobiographical [ ] or social aspects of the self [ ]. The DMN has also been identified as important in task-irrelevant states such as mind wandering or daydreaming [ \u2013 ] and has been shown to lead to errors on tasks demanding external perception [ ]. This latter point, coupled with the DMNs tendency to deactivate when performing such tasks [ ], has led some authors to describe it as a   task negative network   [ \u2013 ] (although see [ ]). Although the interpretations of the DMN as reflecting aspects of the self or as a task-negative system capture isolated aspects of the literature, they fail to provide an overarching account of the functions that this network performs. What is common, for example, to imaging the future or adopting another\u2019s perspective and to deactivations during demanding perceptual tasks? \n\nOne possibility is that the DMN allows cognition to process representations that are not presently available to the senses, an account we will refer to as the   mnemonic facilitation hypothesis  . Two recent studies support this basic premise. Smallwood and colleagues [ ] used a paradigm in which individuals made decisions using information from past trials or from information available on that particular trial. They found that under conditions when individuals were asked to recollect details of the parity of numerical stimuli, regions of the medial pre-frontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex exhibited greater activity when this judgement was made rapidly rather than when it was made slowly. The opposite pattern was observed when decisions were made when the stimulus was available to perception. More recently, Spreng and colleagues [ ] explored the neural recruitment that occurs when participants perform a working memory task containing famous and non-famous faces. They found that the core aspects of the DMN show enhanced activity in a two back task when the target to be retrieved was a famous face, thus involving a combination of working memory and episodic memory. Together these two studies suggest that the role of the DMN in cognition is neither task-negative nor related to personally significant information but may reflect a system that supports a wide range of psychological states that depend on representations that are not available to the senses. \n\nIf a primary function of the DMN was to   allow   representations unrelated to perceptual input to guide thought and behaviour this could also explain why it is implicated in states of imagination that rely on memorial input for their content (such as thinking about the past or the future). Guiding thoughts and actions based on memory is also   unnecessary   for tasks that rely on a continuous focus on perception, explaining why the DMN often deactivates in tasks as the Eriksen Flanker task or Go\u2013No Go tasks and why, under these conditions, its activity can be a cause of error [ , , , ]. The   mnemonic facilitation hypothesis   can also explain why aspects of the DMN are involved in semantic associative processes that depend on representations gained through experience [ ] and why it exhibits activation when working memory targets are also encoded in long term memory (such as when they are a famous face) [ ]. Importantly, it also explains the encoding-retrieval flip phenomenon where the DMN deactivates during encoding and activates during retrieval [ ]. Relative to both the task-negative and autobiographical/social hypothesis, the   mnemonic facilitation hypothesis   leads to a simple prediction:   Regions of the DMN should be more engaged when a decision is made based on information represented in memory rather than immediate perceptual input  . \n\n\n## Current study \n  \nWe developed a paradigm to test of our account of DMN function that builds on both our prior work and that of Spreng and colleagues. Participants alternate between task blocks in which they either make decisions about the location of shapes as they are presented on screen (0-back) or with respect to their location on the prior trial (1-back, see  ). Engaging working memory reduces the occurrence of task unrelated thought [ , \u2013 ]. Based on prior studies, therefore, we expected to replicate an increase in off task thoughts in the 0-back task and to find greater sustained activity in the DMN during this period because of its documented role in cognition that is generated by the individual [ \u2013 ]. \n   Experimental paradigm.  \nParticipants alternated between two tasks. One task involved observing non-coloured shapes presented at fixation waiting for the presentation of a coloured slide at which point they would indicate using a button press which side of the fixation cross a target shape was (0-back). In the other task participants had to encode the identity of shapes presented on screen and when prompted by a coloured slide to respond based on the position of a specific target shape on the prior trial (1-back). This paradigm requires participants to indicate the location of the same stimulus (for example the position of a square) which depends on whether the stimulus is immediately present or absent at the point at which the decision is made. \n  \nCritical to the current investigation, however, is whether the DMN allows operations to be performed on previously acquired representations rather than that which is available to the senses. If it does, it should exhibit greater activity when decisions are made on the position of the shapes in the 1-back task relative to the 0-back task. Importantly because the judgment is regarding the spatial location of triangles, circles or squares, activation of the DMN under these conditions could not be attributed to the personal or emotional significance of the stimulus. Moreover because the 1-back task is more demanding than the 0-back task, greater DMN activity in this context could not be accounted for by the task-negative hypothesis. Finally, because we manipulate whether the same stimulus is available to perception or not, we can rule out differences in the role of long-term memory (such as familiarity with a famous face). To understand these questions we conducted a behavioural experiment to confirm that our modulation of working memory reduced off task thought and an fMRI experiment to explore the   mnemonic facilitation hypothesis   of DMN function. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \n#### Behavioral \n  \nTwenty-nine participants (9 males, age = 21.7\u00b12 years) completed the behavioural study. Participants were recruited using the Psychology Electronic Experiment Booking System (PEEBS) of the University of York. \n\n\n#### Task-based fMRI \n  \nTwenty participants (9 males, age = 23.8\u00b13 years) completed the fMRI study. Participants were recruited using both PEEBS and the York Neuroimaging Center (YNiC) participants\u2019 pool. \n\nBoth studies were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Psychology Department of the University of York. All investigation was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki and for both studies participants provided written informed consent. \n\n\n\n### Task paradigm \n  \n#### Behavioral \n  \nThe task used in this experiment was programmed using PsychoPy [ ]. The task featured a 0-back and a 1-back condition that continuously switched from one another throughout the experimental session (see  ). Our paradigm is broadly similar to the paradigm used by Smallwood and colleagues [ ] and was modified with the specific aim of maximising the differences between the 0-back and the 1-back conditions. In both conditions participants saw different pairs of shapes (Non-Targets, NT) appearing on the screen divided by a vertical line; the pairs could be: a circle and a square, a circle and a triangle, or a square and a triangle for a total of 6 possible pairs (two different left/right configurations for each). The pairs never had shapes of the same kind (e.g. a square and a square). In both tasks a block of NT was followed by target requiring participants to make a manual response. The target was a small stimulus presented in either blue or red and the colour was counterbalanced across participants. In the 0-back condition the target was flanked by one of two shapes and participants had to indicate by pressing the appropriate button which shape matched the target shape. In the 1-back condition, the target was flanked by two question marks and participants had to respond depending on which side the target shape was on the prior trial. For the behavioural study responses were made using the left and right arrow keys, for the neuroimaging study responses were made using a button box. Importantly, unlike the paradigm employed by Smallwood and colleagues [ ] this design ensures that the participants cannot know what response to make when presented with the to be encoded stimulus. \n\nEach block lasted between 40 to 120 seconds before switching to the other condition; the change of condition was signalled by a message (\u201cSWITCH\u201d) that remained on screen for 5 seconds. On each trial the number of NTs preceding the Targets varied between 2 and 6, the number of trials per block varied between 2 and 5 and the total number of blocks was 8 for each condition. The order of conditions was counterbalanced across participants and the whole task lasted ~35 minutes. The total number of targets was 15 to 20 per condition (0-back and 1-back). Also, in every block the word \u201cSTAY\u201d was presented at the end of a trial indicating that participants were to remain in that condition. In order to sample the participants\u2019 ongoing experiences we used a probe-caught, experience sampling method [ , ].The task was built so that there was a 50% chance of a thought probe being presented in place of a Target in a condition block and a maximum of one probe per condition block was allowed. The thought probe consisted in a screen prompting the participants to rate their focus level (\u201cWhere you focused on the task or were you thinking about something else?\u201d) on a scale from 0 (completely off task) to 9 (completely on task). \n\nPresentation rate of the stimuli was jittered in the following way. Fixation crosses ranged from 2\u20134 seconds in steps of 0.1s, Non-targets were varied from 1\u20133 seconds in steps of 0.1s. Targets always lasted a maximum of 4 seconds and a response from participants immediately ended the target presentation. \n\n\n#### Task-based fMRI data acquisition \n  \nThe paradigm used for the fMRI study was essentially the same with the following changes: there were no thought probes presented, fixation crosses were jittered between 2\u20133 seconds in steps of 0.1s, non-targets were jittered between 1\u20132 seconds in steps of 0.1s, targets stayed on the screen for 2.5 seconds regardless of a response being made by participants, switches and stay screens lasted 4 seconds, responses were made using an MRI compatible button box. The total number of blocks was 6 per condition in each run and the total number of targets was 8 to 12 per condition (0-back and 1-back) in each run, making it 12 blocks and 16 to 24 targets per condition in total. \n\nImaging was performed at the York Neuroimaging Centre (YNiC) using a GE 3.0 Tesla HDx Excite MRI scanner using an 8-channel head coil. Functional data were acquired using a T2*-weighted gradient echo planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: 32 interleaved axial slices, repetition time = 2000ms, echo time = 30ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, slice thickness = 3mm, field of view = 192x192, matrix 64x64). The first 10 time points were removed to allow magnetization equilibrium. T1-weighted scans were acquired to confirm no participants had brain abnormalities and for normalization with the following parameters: repetition time = 7.8ms, echo time = 3ms, flip angle = 20\u00b0, slice thickness = 1.13 x 1.13 x 1.0 mm, field of view = 290 x 290 x 176, matrix = 256 x 256 x 176. The scanning session involved a 7 minutes resting state scan (eyes open, fixating on a black cross on grey background) followed by two task runs each lasting approximately 15 minutes. Between the two sessions participants were given a short break. Finally, we recorded a seven minute structural scan. \n\n\n\n### Pre-processing \n  \n#### Task-based fMRI \n  \nPre-processing of the task based fMRI data was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8 [ ]; available at:  ) implemented in Matlab R 2013a (The Mathworks Inc.; available at:  ). Data underwent the following processing steps: (1) slice-time correction, (2) motion correction, (3) co-registration of the T1-weighted image to the mean EPI scans, (4) normalized to MNI space using the T1-weighted normalization parameters computed during unified segmentation, (5) resampled to 2mm isotropic voxels, and (6) smoothed using a 6mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. \n\n\n#### Resting state fMRI \n  \nPre-processing of the resting state data used the DPARSF v2.3 toolbox [ ] implemented in Matlab R 2013a. Data underwent the following processing steps: (1) slice-time correction, (2) motion correction, (3) co-registered the T1-weighted image to the mean functional image, (4) normalized to MNI space using the T1-weighted normalization parameters computed during New Segment and DARTEL, (5) resampled to 2mm isotropic voxels, and (6) smoothed using a 6mm FWHM Gaussian kernel, (7) nuisance regression using the six movement parameters, the signal from the the white matter and the signal from the CSF, and (8) band-pass filtered .008 to .01Hz. \n\n\n\n### First level analysis \n  \n#### Task based fMRI \n  \nTo analyse our mixed block-event related design ( ) [ , ], we employed a GLM to model each event type. The transient events in each task (targets, switches and stays) were modelled as single events with the relevant duration in seconds (2, 4 and 4 respectively). The sustained activity in each task was modelled by creating a block that began at the first NT in each block and lasted until the participant switched to the other task. Each of these events was convolved with the canonical haemodynamic response function as implemented in SPM 8. The GLMs included a constant term per run, a high frequency signal filtering (cut off = 128 s), an AR(1) filter and the motion parameters. For each individual we computed two contrast images: (1) 1-back greater than 0-back sustained responses and (2) 1-back greater than 0-back target transient responses. \n   Analytic strategy.  \nThe task-based data was analysed using a mixed block / event design. We modelled transient events in both tasks as single event with a length equivalent to the stimulus duration. To model the sustained changes that occur during each task block we created a box-car that began at the beginning of the task block and lasted until the participant received the instruction to switch to the other task. \n  \n\n#### Resting state fMRI \n  \nTo provide a quantitative description of the spatial extent of the DMN we calculated the functional connectivity of the PCC region using the resting state scans acquired as part of this study. We calculated the time series of two 6mm diameter spheres centred on the co-ordinates of the PCC [\u20138, \u201352, 26] in each hemisphere reported by Andrews-Hanna et al. [ ] and used these as regressors in a standard functional connectivity analysis implemented using the DPARSF toolbox for SPM. Correlation coefficients were then transformed to Z-scores using Fisher\u2019s r-to-Z transformation for group level analyses. \n\n\n\n### Group Level Analysis \n  \n#### Task-based fMRI \n  \nOne-sample t-tests were used to evaluate the differences in 1-back and 0-back BOLD responses for transient and sustained events separately. Results were masked with the grey matter mask provided by DPARSF. We used a voxel wise threshold of p < 0.01 and topological False Discovery Rate with a p-value of p < 0.05 as implemented in SPM to control for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n#### Resting-state fMRI \n  \nA one-sample t-test was used to determine the extent of the DMN. The subsequent images were thresholded with a T of 7 and binarised. This was used as a mask for analysis of the task based data. \n\n\n#### Conjunction analysis \n  \nOne-sample t-tests were used for the transient and sustained events on the 1-back and 0-back conditions using a cluster-forming threshold of p < 0.05. We then calculated the overlap between the resulting maps and masked them with the DMN mask obtained from the resting-state analysis. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioural \n  \nWe analysed accuracy and response time data for both the behavioural and neuroimaging samples using paired sample t-tests. These demonstrated that participants were both slower and less accurate in the 1-back than in the 0-back task in both experiments (behavioural RTs:   t   (25) = 3.75, p < 0.001; behavioural accuracy:   t   (25) = -4.92, p < 0.001; fMRI RTs:   t   (19) = 6.70, p < 0.001; fMRI accuracy:   t   (19) = 2.38, p = 0.03; see  ). In addition analysis of the experience sampling reports collected in the behavioural study indicated that participants rated their experience as reflecting greater off task thought in the 0-back than the 1-back task (  t   (25) = 2.45, p = 0.02;   C  ). \n   Behavioral results.  \nAnalysis of the behavioural data collected during both the behavioural (top three graphs) and fMRI (bottom two graphs) experiment indicated that participants were both faster (shown in ms) and more accurate when they were asked to make decisions about the location of a shape based on the present trial relative to where it was on the previous trial. In addition, analysis of the experience sampling data recorded in the behavioural experiment (top right graph), demonstrated that participants engaged in more off task thought during the 0-back than the 1-back task: participants rated their task focus on a scale from 0 (completely off task) to 9 (completely on task). The mean of participants\u2019 responses to the probes in each condition is shown. ** p < 0.001, * p < 0.05. \n  \n\n### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) \n  \n#### Whole brain analysis\u2013Transient activity \n  \nWe identified a large set of regions that were significantly more activated for correct responses to the targets in the 1-back task than the 0-back task (see   and  ). These included regions traditionally associated with working memory including the anterior cingulate cortex, the anterior insula (bilaterally), inferior parietal sulcus (IPS) and regions of the lateral pre-frontal cortex (bilaterally). To ascertain whether this pattern of activity is consistently observed in working memory tasks we explored the overlap between our findings and those observed in a meta-analysis of studies involving the term working memory using Neurosynth [ ]. We saw overlaps in regions of mid cingulate cortex as well as dorsal regions of lateral pre-frontal and parietal cortex. This information is presented as a sub panel in  . \n   Whole brain analyses.  \nWe conducted a whole brain analysis of the observed transient and sustained changes in the BOLD signal. Row A): Yellow areas show sustained activation for the 0-back task. Row B): Blue areas show transient activation for the 1-back task. Importantly regions of both the medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex exhibited greater activity during target retrieval in the 1-back task (B) and increased sustained activity in the 0-back condition (A). These images were created using a cluster forming threshold of p < .01 and multiple comparisons were controlled for using topological FDR (p < .05). Subpanel C) on the bottom-right shows the overlap in frontal and posterior dorsal regions between the transient activation for the 1-back task (light blue) and a meta-analysis using the term \u201cworking memory\u201d using Neurosynth (dark blue). \n     Transient activity.  \nRegions showing increased transient BOLD activity during correct responding in the 1-Back > 0 Back task. \n    \nMore relevant to the current investigation was the enhanced activity for targets in the 1-back task that extended into regions of the core DMN including the PCC and mPFC ( ). We found no region exhibiting activity surpassing the cluster-forming threshold for the opposite contrast (0-back > 1-back). \n\n\n#### Whole brain analysis\u2013Sustained activity \n  \nThe easier 0-back task activated areas of the DMN to a greater extent than in the harder 1-back task (see   and  ). These included anterior and posterior regions of the mPFC and the PCC, as well as regions in the temporal parietal junction and the lateral temporal lobes. Activity was also enhanced in the several sub-cortical structures including the caudate / putamen, thalamus, hippocampus. We found no region exhibiting activity surpassing the cluster-forming threshold for the opposite contrast (1-back > 0-back). \n   Sustained activity. Areas showing greater sustained BOLD activity in the O-Back than 1-Back blocks.      \n\n#### DMN Region of interest analysis \n  \nWe repeated the one-sample t-tests reported above using our mask of the DMN (see  ). We found that regions of the precuneus (Prec), the PCC, the mPFC and regions of the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) exhibited greater transient activity for correct responses to the 1-back than the 0-back targets (see  ). Similarly, regions of the PCC, the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), the left middle temporal gyrus (L. MTG) and the hippocampus (Hipp.) exhibited greater sustained activity in the 0-back than the 1-back task (see  ). To demonstrate that these transient and sustained changes constitute increases in the BOLD signal we extracted beta weights from each cluster using the rfxplot toolbox for SPM (Figs   and  ). \n   Transient changes with the Default mode network.  \nWe repeated the analysis using a mask of the DMN created using functional connectivity from a sample of 39 healthy participants. This analysis revealed clusters in the posterior cingulate cortex, regions of the ventral and dorso-medial pre-frontal cortex and the right tempo parietal junction. To identify whether these clusters of activity constituted increases in activity in the 1-back task we extracted the beta weights for each and plotted the group averages. These images were created using a cluster forming threshold of p < .01 and multiple comparisons were controlled for using topological FDR (p < .05). The image used as a mask is presented in the sub-panel. \n     Sustained changes within the Default mode network.  \nTo identify which patterns of increased sustained activity in the 0-back task observed in the whole brain analysis we repeated the analysis using a mask of the DMN created using functional connectivity from a sample of 39 healthy participants. This analysis revealed clusters in the posterior cingulate cortex, the left hippocampus, the left middle temporal gyrus and the right tempo parietal junction. To identify whether these clusters of activity constituted increases in sustained activity in the 0-back task we extracted the beta weights for each and plotted the group averages. These images were created using a cluster forming threshold of p < .01 and multiple comparisons were controlled for using topological FDR (p < .05). The images used as masks are presented in the sub-panel. \n  \n\n#### Conjunction analysis \n  \nFinally we explored the spatial similarities in the sustained and transient changes in the DMN by examining their spatial conjunction. As the logic of conjunction of temporally different events is a relatively stringent statistical test we used a liberal cluster-forming threshold of p < 0.05 to rule out a Type II error. We calculated the overlap between the whole brain analysis of transient increases in the 1-Back task and the sustained increases in the 0-back condition using this liberal threshold. This image was masked by the DMN mask generated from the resting-state fMRI study. This analysis revealed patterns of cluster corrected sustained activity in the 0-back task   and   of target related activity in the 1-back task, which overlapped in a region of the PCC / retrosplenial cortex and in the mPFC (see  ). \n   Spatial conjunction analysis.  \nTo formally compare the activations arising from the sustained and transient increases in DMN activity observed in this experiment we created whole brain images for the Targets (1-back > 0-back) and the Blocks (0-back > 1-back). This analysis used a cluster forming threshold of p < .05 controlling for multiple comparisons using FDR (p < .05). These images were binarised and we calculated their overlap with each other as well as the DMN mask used in the prior analyses using ImCalc function of SPM. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nUsing fMRI during performance of our working memory task, we found brain activity in working memory regions when participants performed a 1-back rather than a 0-back task, confirming previous findings. Importantly, however, these regions were accompanied by activity in regions within the mPFC and PCC corresponding to core hubs of the DMN. These results are inconsistent with at least two prevalent views of the functions of this network. Regions of mPFC and PCC increased activity when making a decision about a shapes position from memory and decreased activity when making the same decision using immediate perceptual input. As deciding where a shape   was   is more difficult than deciding where a shape   is  , the patterns of activation and deactivation of the mPFC and PCC in the more demanding 1-bask task indicates that this activity is   not   a task deactivation [ ]. Furthermore, the relative activation of the mPFC and PCC by decisions regarding the position of a shape demonstrates that strong emotive or autobiographical ties with a stimulus are not necessary to activate these regions [ ]. Nor must the stimulus be encoded in long-term memory [ ] as is the case for a famous face: our study shows that this capacity to guide cognition based on information from memory is   not   equivalent to long\u2013term memory because the core of the DMN was activated when decisions were made based on representations of information that was presented a matter of seconds ago. Instead these data can simply be accounted for by   the mnemonic facilitation hypothesis  :   that core regions of the DMN allow cognitive operations to be guided by information unrelated to immediate perceptual input  . \n\nFurther support for our hypothesis comes from the observation that overlapping regions of the PCC and mPFC exhibited   sustained   activity in the 0-back task as well as   transient   target related activity in 1-back task. Our experience exampling study confirmed that the 0-back task was characterized by greater off task thought (see  ) making it possible that the pattern of activity seen in both the PCC and mPFC may indicate a common role for these regions in allowing cognition the freedom to perform operations that are not constrained by immediate input whether it is to do with the momentary demands of a task or not. Without direct evidence linking DMN activity in the task to the experiences reported by the participants, this interpretation should be treated with caution; however, we hope to test this hypothesis in a larger sample of participants with online measures of self-generated thought in the future. \n\nOur hypothesis that the DMN allows thought and behaviour to be guided by memory explains why this network is prominent in a range of higher order cognitive states such as future thinking, mentalizing or creativity, as well as task irrelevant activities such as daydreaming or mind wandering. All of these states depend on being able to consider information from memory, often to the extent that this can be detrimental to perceptual processing (as in the case of mind-wandering, [ \u2013 ]). Our hypothesis that the DMN allows thought to be shaped by representations from memory also explains why this network has an analogue in a wide range of non-human species. While it is a matter of debate whether complex abilities like mental time travel or language are unique to humans [ ], the capacity to guide behaviour using information from memory is a universal feature of mammalian cognition. As our data suggests that the DMN can support relatively mundane cognitive processes in humans (\u201cWhich side was the triangle on?\u201d) it seems that the presence of analogues for this network in different species may simply reflect the fact that they are also capable of guiding behaviour based on information other than immediate perceptual input. \n\nOur hypothesis gains further support from work showing that perceptual input and DMN activity are often in opposition [ , , ]. For example, the recent work of Huijbers and colleagues [ ] showing DMN increases in episodic memory retrieval and decreases during episodic memory encoding. This suppression of the DMN during encoding is consistent with the reduction in sustained activity we observe in the 1-Back task because under these conditions participants must continually encode information from the environment. Our hypothesis also predicts that changes in the value of immediate input for a specific stimulus or task will be associated with increased activity in the DMN. This prediction is supported by a recent study of repetition suppression, which observed decreases in DMN deactivations during encoding as participants viewed the same items, suggest that the DMN deactivates less as participants form a stronger memory trace of a stimulus [ ]. \n\nWhen participants made decisions in the 1-back task we also observed increased activity in cortical regions outside of the DMN. For example, we found increased activity in the DLPFC and IPS: both elements of the fronto-parietal network (FPN [ , ]). BOLD increases during 1-back decisions were also observed in the anterior insula and anterior cingulate, regions which are important in the cingular-opercular, or saliency network [ ]. Variations on this pattern of network activity has been observed when participants make plans for their future [ \u2013 ], engage in creative thought [ ], resist future rewards in the service of greater long term return [ ], and when maintaining social information in memory [ ]. Most recently, Spreng and colleagues demonstrated that the DMN and the FPN co-operate to perform a working memory task with famous faces as the target [ ]. Our study, therefore, adds to a growing body of research that demonstrates that many complex higher order tasks cannot be attributed to a single neural network and instead depend on the coordinated activity of multiple networks in a flexible fashion (for further discussion see [ , \u2013 ]). \n\nOur data demonstrate that core regions of the DMN are activated when participants are asked   where a shape was   rather than   where it is right now  . A simple account of these data is that it reflects the role of the DMN in allowing cognition to be shaped by representations that are distinct from those provided by immediate perceptual input. We propose this process is   necessary   for a range of different functions including task judgements that depend on recollections based on memory but also daydreams about a holiday or ruminations about a personal problem, thus accounting in a parsimonious manner for many of the functions that utilize the DMN. While this hypothesis is important because it offers an account for why the DMN is common to seemingly disparate functions, it offers no explanation for how these functions are differentiated within the DMN, nor the precise mechanisms that allow behaviour to be guided by information that is represented internally rather in the external environment. Moving forward it is likely we will need more sophisticated models of the cognitive functions that the DMN supports, as well as more comprehensive accounts of the functions that different regions perform, in order to truly understand the complex role this network plays in human cognition. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4488375, "text_md5": "987a830b641b44366265791b0968a170", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 84], "journal": [85, 93], "publication_year": [95, 99], "title": [110, 223], "keywords": [237, 237], "abstract": [250, 1845], "body": [1854, 35495]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 26125559, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0132209", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4488375", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4488375"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4488375\">4488375</a>", "list_title": "PMC4488375  Shaped by the Past: The Default Mode Network Supports Cognition that Is Independent of Immediate Perceptual Input"}

Mother\u2013adolescent dyads (  N  \u2009=\u200922) each completed an empathy task during fMRI, in which they imagined the target person in distressing scenes as either themselves or their family (i.e. child for the mother, mother for the child). Using multi-voxel pattern approach, we compared neural pattern similarity for the self and family conditions and found that mothers showed greater perceptual similarity between self and child in the fusiform face area (FFA), representing high self\u2013child overlap, whereas adolescents showed significantly less self\u2013mother overlap. Adolescents\u2019 pattern similarity was dependent upon family relationship quality, such that they showed greater self\u2013mother overlap with higher relationship quality, whereas mothers\u2019 pattern similarity was independent of relationship quality. Furthermore, adolescents\u2019 perceptual similarity in the FFA was associated with increased social brain activation (e.g. temporal parietal junction). Mediation analyses indicated that high relationship quality was associated with greater social brain activation, which was mediated by greater self\u2013mother overlap in the FFA. Our findings suggest that adolescents show more distinct neural patterns in perceiving their own   vs   their mother\u2019s distress, and such distinction is sensitive to mother\u2013child relationship quality. In contrast, mothers\u2019 perception for their own and child\u2019s distress is highly similar and unconditional. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEmotional experiences often occur in an interpersonal context. For example, parents may experience more negative feelings themselves when their child is upset. Experiencing empathy with regard to others\u2019 pain or distress is found across species including rodents, non-human primates and humans, in infants as young as a few months of age, as well as across many forms of social relationships (e.g. for strangers, loved ones, etc.;  ;  \u2009b;  ). At its most basic core, empathy facilitates parental care of their offspring and paves the way for successful social and emotional development in youth ( ;  ;  \u2009b). A parents\u2019 ability to perceive and respond to emotional cues of their offspring, such as hunger, pain or distress, is essential for survival and has been hardwired at the neural level to promote parental care in mammalian species as an innate protective system for their offspring ( \u2009b). Indeed, studies have shown that parental empathic experiences and neural engagement of the empathy network are more intensified when parents see their own child\u2019s pain compared with an unknown child\u2019s pain ( ;  ). Similarly, when mothers make caregiving decisions for their child, neural activation in the empathy network, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), limbic and sensory regions, increases to meet the needs of their child ( ). Although emerging evidence supports maternal empathy for their own child\u2019s emotions, it is unclear whether children\u2019s empathy is equivalent to their parents\u2019 emotional perception of their offspring. Thus, the current study aimed to capture empathy processes in an interpersonal context within parent\u2013child dyads. \n\nOne important aspect of empathy is the phenomenon by which one blurs the line between self and other ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Theories suggest that understanding others\u2019 emotions and actions begin by perceptually representing or mirroring others\u2019 feelings and actions onto one\u2019s own states ( ;  ;  ;  ). According to   perception\u2013action model, the initial perception of others\u2019 states can lead perceivers to have high self\u2013other mental representation in feelings and actions, thereby eliciting emotional contagion and empathic responses as behavioral outcomes. Perceiving others\u2019 emotion (i.e. perceptual encoding) enables individuals to simulate others\u2019 states as one\u2019s own states, and thereby forms self\u2013other overlap ( ;  ;  ). That is, how we perceive others\u2019 emotions could be an important gateway to how we share mental representations with others for empathic actions. An important consideration for the emergence of empathy is thus whether individuals show a similar representation of the self and other during perceptual encoding and whether such perceptual similarity facilitates further empathic responding. \n\nPerceptual representation for self\u2013other overlap can be characterized as a bottom-up process because it requires one to detect and encode others\u2019 states first ( ;  ). Indeed, studies have shown that empathic responses during the observation of others\u2019 pain are associated with increased activation in early perception-sensory regions such as extrastriate body area, fusiform gyrus and sensory-motor area (e.g.  ;  ;  ). This bottom-up process may influence social cognitive top-down modulation, in which the perceptual representation for others is evaluated to make subsequent inferences for others\u2019 situation ( ;  ;  ;  ). For example, social cognitive regions, such as the temporal parietal junction (TPJ), medial PFC (MPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), show increased activity for in-group member\u2019s pain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), along with increased neural activation of sensory-perception regions ( ;  ). In this vein, researchers highlight the importance of both affective and cognitive components of empathy that influence the extent of empathic concern and potential prosocial behavior ( ;  ;  ). In this model, the bottom-up affective component helps perceivers to increase personal distress and attention for understanding other\u2019s affective states, and the top-down cognitive component regulates perceiver\u2019s emotional arousal and leads to prosocial behavior by recruiting cognitive control resources. However, too much personal distress, induced by emotional arousal and contagion, can impede the perceiver\u2019s empathic behaviors as it depletes cognitive resources to regulate their own affective arousal, thereby failing to attend to others\u2019 needs ( ). \n\nPrevious work has focused on the neural involvement of either early sensory-perception processes (e.g.  ;  ) or higher-order social cognitive processes (e.g.  ) independently, instead of conceptualizing empathy as a continuum from the initial representation at the perception level to later social cognitive processes. Thus, empirical research which integrates how the self and others are represented during the initial perception and how this perceptual representation is associated with mentalizing processes will shed light on our understanding of how empathy arises in the brain. In the current study, we scanned both mothers and their adolescent child as they engaged in a task that measures empathic responses when perceiving their own and each other\u2019s distress. We sought to examine how empathic experiences are modulated by perceptual representation based on the perception-action perspective ( ;  ). In particular, we examined perceptual encoding of self\u2013other overlap in the fusiform face area (FFA), and whether higher perceptual similarity is associated with empathic responses in social\u2013cognitive brain regions. Our perceptual similarity analysis of self\u2013other overlap focused on neural patterns in the FFA because evidence indicates that the FFA is involved in the initial encoding of faces as an early visual perception process ( ). Importantly, the mental imagination of faces and encoding emotionality and social information from faces significantly increases neural activation in the FFA ( ;  ;  ). To quantify the representation similarity, we adopted the representational similarity analysis (RSA;  ) as a form of multi-voxel pattern approach. This pattern-focused approach allows us to test how neural representations when perceiving self and other are similar by focusing on signal variations of neural response across voxels (i.e. multi-voxel pattern), rather than simply changes in the overall fMRI magnitude between parent and adolescent groups (i.e. univariate neural activation). \n\nWe tested three key hypotheses. First, mothers\u2019 perceptual representation of distress for self and child would be highly similar, as evidenced by greater neural pattern similarity in the FFA regardless of the quality of their relationship. In contrast, adolescents would show less similar perceptual representation of distress for self and mother, and such representational similarity would depend upon their relationship quality. Previous studies have indicated that parental concerns for their offspring are stable and unconditional regardless of social environmental factors ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). For instance, parents\u2019 perception of closeness to their child is stable as parents focus on deemphasizing conflicts and increasing support in their roles as parents for their child\u2019s well-being ( ;  ;  ). Indeed, following pregnancy, mothers' socioemotional neural system shifts to support empathy and care of their child ( ). In contrast, the adolescent period is marked by a social reorientation away from parents and towards peers ( ). Adolescents report decreased closeness in parent\u2013child relationship quality ( ), combined with exaggeration of conflicts to diminish closeness with parents as a means of establishing autonomy ( ;  ;  ). Thus, adolescents\u2019 perceptual representation of distress for self and mother would be more conditional, such that adolescents will only show high neural pattern similarity in the FFA when they report stronger relationship quality. \n\nSecond, we tested whether perceptual encoding (i.e. representational pattern similarity in the FFA) is associated with higher social cognitive processing. Perceptual representation similarity in the FFA, an index of self\u2013family overlap, was used as a regressor in a univariate general linear model (GLM) analysis to link initial perception to subsequent empathic processes in social brain regions, which include the TPJ, MPFC and PCC ( ). In other words, the level of neural engagement in the social brain when processing family and self will depend on the perceptual similarity in the FFA. As suggested by theories of empathy (e.g.  ), the initial perceptual representation process for others\u2019 states subsequently elicits emotional contagion and empathic response. Although the sluggish nature of the fMRI signal does not allow us to test direct temporal influences between processes, we hypothesized that higher perceptual similarity in the FFA, a neural index of self\u2013family perceptual overlap, would be associated with greater neural recruitment of mentalizing processes in social brain regions. \n\nFinally, we performed mediation analyses to test an integrated model linking mother\u2013child relationship quality, the perceptual similarity in self\u2013\u2013family overlap and neural engagement of social brain regions. We hypothesized that greater relationship quality in adolescents would be associated with the recruitment of social brain regions during empathic responses, and this path would be mediated by greater encoding of perceptual similarity in the FFA. Whereas relationship quality would be a key predictor of perceptional similarity and social brain responding in adolescents, we predicted that relationship quality would not influence empathic responses in mothers because mothers\u2019 socioemotional system is more stable and invariable for their offspring ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-two healthy mother\u2013adolescent dyads were recruited to participate in this study (adolescents:   M  \u2009=\u200913.90\u2009years, s.d.\u2009=\u20090.11, 21% female; mothers:   M  \u2009=\u200944.26\u2009years, s.d.\u2009=\u20091.57, 100% female). Mothers and their adolescent child each underwent an fMRI scan on the same day. Participants were compensated $50 each for their participation. All participants provided written informed consent and assent approved by the Institutional Review Board. \n\n\n### Task design and procedure \n  \nThe task was modified from prior work on neural processing of empathy, a task which has reliably recruited neural regions involved in mentalizing ( ;  ). During the task, adolescents and mothers each saw individuals expressing emotional distress in negative contexts (e.g. at a funeral or being bullied), with instructions to perceive the target face as either their family member (family-condition; mother for the child\u2019s scan or child for the mother\u2019s scan) or themselves (self-condition). Participants were instructed to imagine the person in the picture as themselves and to take the perspective of the person in the picture during the self-condition. For the family-condition, participants were instructed to imagine the person in the picture as their parent/child, and to take the perspective of the person in the picture as if it were their family member. When the target individuals appeared in the social scenes with many other people, a white arrow was inserted to guide participants to the target face (see  ). The stimulus conditions were balanced by gender of target face. The gender of faces was not matched to the subject, and participants were instructed to imagine the person in each image as themselves (self-condition) or their family member (family-condition) regardless of the gender of the person. The age of the target face for each group (e.g. family and self) was matched. Each trial lasted between 8 and 9.2\u2009s and was followed by 2\u2009s rating phase consisting of a 10-point Likert scale to indicate how they felt from \u22125 (very negative) to 5 (very positive).  Two independent blocks for self- and family conditions consisted of 12 event-related trials each (i.e. mixed-design). Each block was separated by a 5-s blank screen, and inter-trial intervals were inserted between trials to separate the BOLD signal jittered between 2.0 and 3.2\u2009s (mean\u2009=\u20092.4\u2009s).\n \n  \n(A) Experimental condition for mothers and adolescent children, (B) schematic procedure of computing similarity values within the region of interest between trials and (C) example of the representational similarity matrix. \n  \n\n### fMRI data acquisition and analysis \n  \n#### Image acquisition, preprocessing and registration \n  \nImaging data were collected using a 3T-Siemens Trio MRI scanner with a 32-channel matrix coil. High-resolution structural images (T1-MPRAGE) were acquired first (repetition time or TR\u2009=\u20091.9\u2009s; echo time or TE\u2009=\u20092.3\u2009ms; matrix size\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256; field of view or FOV\u2009=\u2009230\u2009mm; flip angle or FA\u2009=\u200990\u00b0; 1\u2009mm isotropic voxel). T2*-weighted echoplanar images were acquired during the emotion perception task (38 slices with 0.3\u2009mm inter-slice gap; TR\u2009=\u20092\u2009s; TE\u2009=\u200925\u2009ms; matrix\u2009=\u200992\u2009\u00d7\u200992; FOV\u2009=\u2009230\u2009mm; FA\u2009=\u200990\u00b0; voxel size 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009mm; slice thickness\u2009=\u20093\u2009mm). \n\nPreprocessing was carried out using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) Version 6.00, part of FSL (FMRIB\u2019s Software Library;  ). The following pre-statistics processing was applied: motion correction using MCFLIRT ( ); non-brain removal using BET ( ); grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire 4D data set by a single multiplicative factor; spatial smoothing applied only for univariate whole-brain analysis with Gaussian kernel of full width at half maximum 6\u2009mm. For univariate analysis, registration matrix was estimated additionally between functional images, high-resolution structural images and standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 2-mm brain using FLIRT ( ;  ). \n\n\n#### RSA (multi-voxel pattern analysis) \n  \nFor the RSA, we first estimated single-trial activation patterns for each trial using least squares single methods ( ) where each single-level GLM included regressors for a current trial and all other remaining trials with temporal derivate regressor. We included the rating phase in the model as a regressor of non-interest (i.e. nuisance regressor) as well as motion regressors (six motion parameters and motion-outlier points). For each participant, the standardized voxel-wise pattern activity (i.e.   z  -transformed parameter estimates) was extracted and vectorized within the FFA region of interest (ROI) (see ROI selection for more details). The extracted patterns were then analyzed by calculating pairwise   Pearson   coefficient (i.e. similarity value) between each trial with every possible pair of other trials ( ), and then applied Fisher\u2019s   r  -to-  z   transformation, producing a symmetric 24\u2009\u00d7\u200924 similarity matrix for each dyad and the ROI ( ). Finally, the average of self\u2013family similarity values was used for subsequent analyses (e.g.  ). \n\n\n#### Univariate group-level analysis with RSA as a covariate \n  \nTo assess how perceptual encoding (i.e. representational pattern similarity in FFA) is associated with higher-level social cognitive processing, an additional standard two-stage mixed-effects analysis was performed. The GLM of the BOLD signal for each perception type (family and self) was estimated with temporal derivate regressors at the first level using a double-gamma hemodynamic response function. We added the rating phase in the model as a regressor of non-interest (i.e. nuisance regressor) to the design matrix as well as motion regressors (six motion parameters and motion-outlier points). The individuals\u2019 data were then inputted into a random-effects model using cluster detection statistics with outlier-deweighting at a threshold of   Z  \u2009>\u20092.3 and a cluster probability of   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 (one-tailed), corrected for whole-brain multiple comparisons using Gaussian Random Field Theory. In particular, we entered each individual\u2019s FFA similarity values (demeaned for each group) as covariates in the group-level analysis to examine how perceptual similarity in the FFA to self and other is associated with neural encoding of self and other in social\u2013cognitive regions. \n\n\n#### ROI selection \n  \nIn this study, we indexed neural representation at the encoding stage by examining neural pattern similarity within the FFA, a key region in visual face encoding ( ). We constructed the ROI mask of a priori voxels associated with \u2018FFA\u2019, \u2018emotional face\u2019, \u2018faces\u2019 and \u2018face perception\u2019 from the reversed inference map (  q  \u2009<\u20090.1 FDR-corrected) in the NeuroSynth database ( ; downloaded on 24 November 2015). The final FFA voxels were then selected along with the ventral temporal cortex at   Z  \u2009=\u20093.71 (  a total 321 voxels). \n\n\n\n### Family relationship quality \n  \nTo capture a comprehensive measure of relationship quality between mothers and adolescent children, three measures were assessed from both mothers and adolescent children: family cohesion (Family Adaptation and Cohesion Evaluation Scales II inventory, FACE II;  ), family conflict ( ;  ) and family identity ( ). We created a composite score of positive family relationship quality by taking the score of family cohesion, reverse-scored family conflict and family identity, with higher scores indicating more positive parent\u2013child relationships. This composite score provides us with a comprehensive measure of relationship quality using these three dimensions ( ). Details for each scale are as follows: \n\n#### Family cohesion \n  \nParticipants completed the Cohesion subscale of the FACE II ( ). They responded to 10 items that assessed how close they feel and how much time they spend with their mother [child] on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). Sample items included \u2018My mother [child] and I do things together\u2019, \u2018My mother [child] and I are supportive of each other during difficult times\u2019, and \u2018My mother [child] and I feel close to one another\u2019 (internal consistency   \u03b1  \u2009=\u20090.81 for mother;   \u03b1  \u2009=\u20090.88 for child). The 10 items were averaged, and higher scores indicate greater relationship closeness. \n\n\n#### Family conflict \n  \nParent\u2013child conflict was assessed by 10 items ( ;  ) (e.g. \u2018You and your parents [child] had a serious argument or fight\u2019 and \u2018You and your parents [child] yelled or raised your voices at each other\u2019). Participants reported how true each item was for them in the past month on a 5-point scale ranging from \u2018almost never\u2019 to \u2018almost always\u2019 (  \u03b1  \u2009=\u20090.88 and 0.92 for mother and child, respectively). The 10 items were averaged, such that higher scores indicate greater conflicts with family members. \n\n\n#### Family identity \n  \nParticipants completed an eight-item scale that assessed the extent to which their family is an important aspect of their identity ( ). Using a 5-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), participants indicated how much their sense of self was internalized to their family value (e.g. \u2018I feel like a valued member of my family\u2019 and \u2018My family is important to the way I think of myself as a person\u2019;   \u03b1  \u2009=\u20090.83 and 0.87 for mother and child, respectively). The eight items were averaged, and higher scores indicate greater internalized family values. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### RSA: perceptual similarity for self and family \n  \nTo examine how mothers and adolescent children perceive the emotional distress of their family and self at the perceptual level, we compared the similarity value in FFA of mothers when perceiving their own and their child\u2019s emotional distress and of adolescents when perceiving their own and their mother\u2019s emotional distress. As shown in  , mothers showed greater neural similarity in perceptual representation in the FFA when perceiving emotional distress in self   vs   child (  M  \u2009=\u20090.24, s.d.\u2009=\u20090.06), whereas their adolescent children showed significantly less neural pattern similarity between the conditions (  M  \u2009=\u20090.17, s.d.\u2009=\u20090.07), paired-  t  (20)\u2009=\u2009\u22124.11,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% confidence interval (CI)  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.09 to \u22120.03. That is, mothers\u2019 perception of their child\u2019s emotional distress within each dyad is more similar to their own emotional distress compared with their own adolescent child\u2019s perception of self and mother.\n \n  \n(A) Whisker plot for the neural pattern similarity between self and family condition calculated within FFA ROI. Black and white bar within indicate mean and median, respectively. Red-colored dots indicate individual\u2019s similarity point; one mother had extremely low similarity value (0.002; gray-colored square) that was far less than 2.5 s.d. under the mean. We excluded this mother for the final analyses. (B) Scatter plots of the similarity values and relationship quality for adolescents and mothers. Dotted lines indicate 95% CI of the regression line. Note that all statistical results remained same when the outlier mother was included; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009\u22120.09 to\u2009\u2212\u20090.03 for panel A and 95% CI\u2009=\u2009\u22120.29 to 0.68 for panel B. \n  \nAs hypothesized, children\u2019s perceptual similarity was dependent upon their family relationship quality, such that they showed greater perceptual similarity when they reported higher relationship quality,   r  (22)\u2009=\u20090.45,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% CI  \u2009=\u20090.09\u20130.72, whereas mothers\u2019 neural pattern similarity was high and independent of relationship quality,   r  (21)\u2009=\u20090.07,   P  \u2009>\u20090.05, 95% CI  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.42 to 0.52 ( ). To rule out the possibility of ceiling effects relating to the finding that there was no association between mother\u2019s perceptual similarity and relationship quality compared to adolescents, we compared the relationship quality in dyads and found no significant difference between mother and child, paired-  t  (21)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.14,   P  \u2009>\u20090.05, 95% CI  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.38 to 0.32. This result indicates that the null finding for mothers was not due to ceiling effects for relationship quality. In sum, mothers show high self\u2013child overlap in perceptual similarity in the FFA regardless of their relationship quality with their child. In contrast, adolescent children only showed high perceptual similarity in the FFA when they also reported high relationship quality with their family, suggesting that adolescent children\u2019s self\u2013family overlap is dependent upon their relationship quality. \n\n\n### Group-level univariate analysis with FFA similarity predicting social brain activation for self and family \n  \nTo test the prediction that higher neural similarity for self and family at the perceptual level is associated with neural processing in higher-level, social\u2013cognitive regions, we examined which brain regions covaried with perceptual similarity in the FFA. To this end, we used FFA similarity from the self and family conditions and regressed this similarity value onto neural activation when perceiving self   vs   family\u2019s emotional distress (self\u2009>\u2009family). Note that greater activation for this contrast represents greater differences in neural responses to self and family. We found that greater perceptual similarity between self and family in adolescents was negatively associated with neural activation in several social brain regions including bilateral TPJ, PCC and mPFC (  and  ), suggesting that greater similarly in the FFA at the encoding stage was associated with lower differentiation of self and family in the social brain processing for empathy.\n   \nBrain regions which correlated with perceptual similarity on family-self condition in adolescents \n    \n  \nNegatively covaried social brain regions (circled area) with (A) the increased family\u2013self perceptual similarity of FFA (B) the degree of family relationship quality in family\u2013self contrast of adolescent children. See also   and   for other clusters. \n  \nNext, we regressed family relationship quality onto neural activation when perceiving self   vs   family\u2019s emotional distress and found negative correlations in several social brain regions as a function of adolescents\u2019 family relationship quality (  and  ). That is, adolescents who reported greater relationship quality showed lower differentiation of self and family in the social brain during empathic responding. Social brain regions of mothers were not modulated by the perceptual similarity for self and child (see   for local maxima regions in the clusters).\n   \nBrain regions which correlated with mother-child relationship quality on family-self condition in adolescents \n    \n\n\n### Mediation analysis \n  \nTo integrate the results of perceptual similarity in the FFA, neural engagement in the social brain and family relationship quality, we performed a mediation analysis. We tested whether relationship quality (i.e. independent variable) is associated with less differentiation of self and family in social\u2013cognitive regions (i.e. outcome) through increased perceptual similarity in the FFA (i.e. mediator). To this end, we extracted and averaged activation from the social brain regions which were identified in the analyses above, and performed mediation analyses using the mediation toolbox in Matlab ( ). As shown in  , the path between family relationship quality and perceptual similarity in the FFA for self and mother (path a;   a  \u2009=\u20090.05,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% CI  \u2009 \u2009=\u20090.01\u20130.09) and the path between perceptual similarity and social brain regions identified in the univariate analysis (path b;   b  \u2009=\u2009\u22122.50,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% CI  \u2009 \u2009=\u2009\u22124.07 to \u22121.20) were statistically significant. Importantly, the mediation effect was significant (  ab  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.11,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% CI  \u2009 \u2009=\u2009\u22120.25 to \u22120.01), indicating that greater perceptual similarity for self and family explains the link between strong family relationship quality and less differentiation in the social brain for self   vs   family. Only adolescents showed this significant mediating effect, whereas mothers did not (  ab  \u2009=\u20090.01,   P  \u2009>\u20090.05, 95% CI  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.07 to 0.09). In sum, these results suggest that not only is the quality of the relationship important for high perceptual similarity for both the self and their family but also that high self\u2013other overlap at the perceptual level explains the link between family relationship quality and empathic responding in higher-level social\u2013cognitive regions.\n \n  \nPerceptual similarity in the FFA mediates the link between perceived family connectedness and social brain activation in adolescents. Note that asterisk indicates statistical significance at   P  \u2009=0.05 (95% CI) based on 50 000 bootstrapping resampling. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we examined mothers and their child's empathic neural representations for the self and family. Using representation similarity analysis, we found that mothers\u2019 perceptual similarity in the FFA for self and their child\u2019s emotional distress was significantly higher compared to their child's self\u2013mother perceptual similarity, indicating that mothers show high self\u2013child overlap compared to their adolescent child. In contrast, adolescents\u2019 perceptual similarity was dependent upon their relationship quality, such that they showed high self\u2013other overlap for their mother\u2019s emotional distress and their own only when they reported high relationship quality with their family. It is worth noting that these similarity results were based on within-family comparisons, indicating that each mother shows higher perceptual similarity than her own child. Moreover, this initial perceptual representation in the fusiform in adolescents was associated with neural activation in social brain regions required to put oneself in another\u2019s shoes ( ), whereas no such modulatory effects of perceptual similarity on the social brain were found in mothers. Consistent with previous evidence showing that parents\u2019 perspective to their child is more stable and robust, whereas adolescent children begin to reduce closeness with their parents as a means of establishing autonomy ( ;  ;  ), these results suggest that mothers\u2019 empathy to their child is more unconditional compared to that of their adolescent child. Finally, the mediation model confirmed that family relationship quality is associated with adolescent's mental representation for both the self and their family at the perceptual (i.e. fusiform perceptual representation similarity) and higher-level social cognitive processing level. \n\nMothers\u2019 attention is unconditionally directed toward their offspring to understand, make sense of and respond to their child\u2019s feelings and behaviors across the lifespan. This maternal empathic bias has deep evolutionary underpinnings at the neural level to be selective and protective of her own offspring ( ;  \u2009b) such that mothers\u2019 empathy promotes positive developmental outcomes, such as mood stability and regulated stress reactivity in developing youth ( ). Our findings support this perspective for maternal empathy by showing that maternal empathic processes for their child are more robust compared to children. In our mediation model, we found that mothers\u2019 mentalizing process for their child\u2019s emotional distress was modulated by neither the relationship quality nor the degree of self\u2013child overlap in the FFA. It is possible that mothers were at ceiling with less variability in perceptual similarity in the FFA as well as social brain activation. Importantly, a recent neuroimaging study revealed that brain regions associated with empathy are dramatically reconfigured after pregnancy in a mother\u2019s brain ( ), which enables mothers to be more selective and sensitive to their own offspring. In other words, the neural connections in mothers\u2019 brains become fine-tuned and strengthened to utilize neural resources optimally for their own offspring. This neural reconfiguration is enduring for mothers after pregnancy and into adolescence, highlighting mothers\u2019 strong self\u2013child overlap. In contrast, adolescents are establishing a sense of identity by expanding their social network, spending more time and sharing their affection with others outside of the family ( ). Unlike mothers, adolescents\u2019 brains are more likely to be sensitive to their social environment ( ), particularly their peers ( ). Therefore, adolescents\u2019 mental representations are more flexible depending on social contexts ( ). Thus, this study suggests that adolescents\u2019 empathy is more conditional whereas mothers show empathy for their child that is stable and unconditional. \n\nThe current findings elaborate upon previous theories ( ;  ;  ;  ) by showing how empathic experiences arise based on the interaction of two different processes, the bottom-up perceptual encoding process and the top-down social cognition process. Theories of empathy propose that empathy to others includes various mental and behavioral phenomena, such as shared and vicarious emotional experiences associated with prosocial (helping) reactions as a result of perceiving others\u2019 emotional states ( ;  ;  ;  ). Therefore, an approach to integrate these two empathy components (\u2018perception and action\u2019 or \u2018bottom-up and top-down processing\u2019) with a continuum perspective is critical for understanding empathic experiences. The current study demonstrates that perceptual representation similarity in the fusiform, representing an initial mental representation of self\u2013other emotional distress, is an important gateway to neural activation involved in higher social cognitive processing. Interestingly, this two-component model was only valid for adolescents. \n\nIn our study, the quality of perceptual representation at the encoding level in the FFA was quantified using RSA as a form of multi-voxel pattern approach. Employing neural pattern approach allows us to examine neural representational patterns in the perceptual region (i.e. FFA for facial expression) rather than simply examining whether this region shows differential neural activation to self   vs   others\u2019 emotional distress (i.e. univariate analysis). To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine how perceptual representation at the encoding level is related to the degree of empathy processing at the social\u2013cognitive level. However, it should be noted that our model implying the temporal aspects of empathic experience from the initial encoding to later social cognition could not be tested directly. Although we built this model based on previous theories and empirical evidence in empathy ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), the sluggish nature of the BOLD signal precludes our ability to test the model in a temporal manner, and thus the current results cannot confirm causality explicitly between these two distinct processes. Experimental designs that can disentangle these two processes in a causal manner would help us to probe the temporal influences between the bottom-up and top-down processes in empathic experiences. \n\nNonetheless, some evidence highlights the importance of early sensory-perception processing for later social\u2013cognitive processing. For example, emotion perception studies have demonstrated that emotional information is pre-evaluated during the early encoding in perception-sensory regions, such as somatosensory and early visual cortex (e.g.  ;  ;). Importantly, early sensory-perception bottom-up processing shifts the quality of later cognitive top-down processing, such that impairment of somatosensory processing can impair recognition of face emotions at the later top-down stage ( ). Similarly, event-related potential (ERP) research has shown that late top-down processing in face emotion recognition reflected by late the cognitive component (400\u2013800\u2009ms) is significantly modulated depending on how face stimuli are encoded at the early bottom-up stage represented at the early sensory-perception component (200\u2013300\u2009ms;  ). Thus, it is plausible that social brain region changes observed in the current study are influenced by perceptual representation at the encoding level first. Our regression model using mediation also supports this pathway, such that perceptual similarity in the FFA significantly mediated the association between relationship quality and social brain activation to self and family. \n\nIn the current study, we recruited mothers and adolescents using dyadic recruitment (i.e. mothers and adolescents from the same family), which is a strength of the sample. However, the sample size is relatively small, precluding our ability to examine sex differences among adolescents or between mothers and fathers. Furthermore, our adolescent-only sample does not allow us to probe why adolescents show less self\u2013other overlap compared to adults (i.e. mothers). For example, it is possible that there may be linear increases in self\u2013family overlap across development, as social cognitive abilities increase across this age range. Thus, recruitment of pre-adolescent children would further enable us to probe whether the effects we found change linearly with age. Moreover, examining other targets in the task (e.g. peers) would help us tease apart whether the source of low self\u2013mother overlap is due to adolescents beginning to show greater self\u2013other overlap with their peers as they transition into adolescence ( ). Longitudinal research and studies recruiting larger and different samples including children, adolescents, peers and other family members (e.g. sibling and father) will help to unpack developmental trajectories in empathic responding for self and other. \n\nThis study shows that relationship quality may set the stage for social\u2013cognitive processing and may positively affect brain development in social\u2013cognitive regions. Such development may have broader implications for empathy development and adolescents\u2019 ability to mentalize and take the perspective of others\u2019 emotions. Our results can inform future interventions for increasing empathy and related prosocial behavior by elucidating the role of relationship quality in promoting social\u2013cognitive processing. Thus, interventions designed to enhance relationship quality with others may promote greater self\u2013other overlap, thereby enhancing empathy and prosocial relationships in youth. \n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to directly examine empathy processes with a continuum perspective from the initial perceptual representation to the later mentalizing stage at the neural level by employing both multivariate (i.e. representational neural pattern analysis) and univariate approaches (i.e. general linear model). Moreover, by scanning both mothers and their children, we compared how adolescents\u2019 and their mothers\u2019 empathy for their family and the self are similar. Our results suggest that mothers have unconditional empathic responses to their child\u2019s emotional distress based on higher self\u2013child overlap in their mental representation, whereas adolescents\u2019 empathy is more conditional. This study contributes to our knowledge about empathy processes with the critical importance of perceptual representation in mentalizing others\u2019 emotional distress. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis work was supported by the National Institute of Health (1R01DA039923) and generous funds from the Department of Psychology at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. \n\n Conflict of interest  .

Despite this, questions remain regarding the areas that contribute consistently across paradigms with different task demands. For instance, sensorimotor tasks focus on learning novel movement kinematics and dynamics, while serial response time task (SRTT) variants focus on sequence learning. These differing task demands are likely to elicit quantifiably different patterns of neural activity on top of a potentially consistent core network. The current study identified consistent activations across 70 motor learning experiments using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis. A global analysis of all tasks revealed a bilateral cortical\u2013subcortical network consistently underlying motor learning across tasks. Converging activations were revealed in the dorsal premotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex, primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, superior parietal lobule, thalamus, putamen and cerebellum. These activations were broadly consistent across task specific analyses that separated sensorimotor tasks and SRTT variants. Contrast analysis indicated that activity in the basal ganglia and cerebellum was significantly stronger for sensorimotor tasks, while activity in cortical structures and the thalamus was significantly stronger for SRTT variants. Additional conjunction analyses then indicated that the left dorsal premotor cortex was activated across all analyses considered, even when controlling for potential motor confounds. The highly consistent activation of the left dorsal premotor cortex suggests it is a critical node in the motor learning network. \n   Highlights  \n\u25ba Activation likelihood estimation was used to analyze 70 motor learning experiments. \u25ba Analysis revealed a cortico-subcortical network for motor learning. \u25ba Consistent activations were found across subgroups with differing task demands. \u25ba Left dorsal premotor cortex was identified as a key structure in motor learning. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFunctional neuroimaging studies have been instrumental in determining the neuronal networks that underlie different types of motor learning tasks reviewed in  . There is, however, little consensus regarding which areas of the brain are consistently activated during the acquisition of motor skills. This may be a result of the diverse range of experimental paradigms that have been used to examine motor learning. For instance, neuroimaging studies have examined a variety of sensorimotor paradigms, including learning dexterous skills such as playing musical instruments ( ) or tying knots ( ), learning visuomotor paradigms such as adapting movements in response to perturbations ( ), and phase coordination paradigms where participants learn to perform novel bimanual movement patterns ( ). Performance improvements in these sensorimotor tasks occur as participants learn to perform novel kinematics (movement speed and limb geometry) and/or dynamics (muscle forces and joint coordination). In contrast to sensorimotor tasks, variants of the serial reaction time task (SRTT;  ) are notable as they rely on responding to visual stimuli only by pressing a corresponding button. SRTT variants therefore represent   learning of sequential motor behavior  , yet have relatively   minimal demands on motor execution  , as participants respond through primarily isometric contractions of the finger muscles. Thus, while sensorimotor tasks and SRTT variants are both useful paradigms with which to examine the neural substrates that underlie motor learning, their actual task demands differ considerably; sensorimotor tasks have greater motor demands and emphasize the learning of novel movement kinematics and dynamics, while SRTT variants have relatively minimal motor demands and focus on learning sequential motor behavior. Identifying areas of diverging activation (i.e. those that are activated primarily by sensorimotor tasks or SRTT variants) will thus reveal activations relating to the specific demands of each task type. Conversely, areas that are consistently activated across both sensorimotor tasks and SRTT variants are likely to represent the \u2018core\u2019 network of brain structures that are essential for motor learning. Areas identified as being critical to motor learning could then be targeted using neurostimulation techniques, which have been used to modulate the function of brain structures in order to augment skill acquisition ( ). \n\nPrevious qualitative reviews have highlighted both similarities and differences between the areas that underlie motor learning for sensorimotor tasks and SRTT variants.   suggested both paradigms activate the striatum and cerebellum, but that sensorimotor paradigms are more dependent on cortical motor areas while SRTT variants place greater reliance on prefrontal areas.   describe a framework where two cortico-striatal-cerebellar loops underlie motor sequence learning. Performance improves rapidly during initial phases of learning, with changes being driven by an \u2018associative\u2019 loop. This loop comprises frontal, parietal and premotor cortical regions, the caudate, and associative cerebellar regions. The gradual increments in performance that occur later, however, are predominantly driven by a \u2018motor\u2019 loop. This loop consists of motor areas of the cortex, putamen, and cerebellum. The authors note, however, that this model may not hold for sensorimotor adaptation tasks such as learning to move against curl fields or learning visuomotor rotations. In contrast,  ,   propose a single model that can encompass both types of task. Sensorimotor tasks such as motor adaptation primarily recruit a network of cortico-cerebellar structures, while sequence learning tasks instead involve greater contributions from a cortico-striatal system. \n\nDespite the conflicting nature of these models, there is a degree of consensus regarding the specific roles that individual brain areas contribute to motor learning. The cerebellum is widely considered to maintain a \u2018forward model\u2019 of the motor apparatus, used to predict the sensory consequences of actions and detect errors in these predictions ( ). Despite some controversy, it is widely suggested that the basal ganglia are implicated in probabilistic calculations and reward for optimal action selection ( ). The primary motor cortex (M1) is consistently implicated in the use dependent acquisition and storage of muscle synergies required for faster and more precise movements ( ). The relatively consistent interpretations of the roles of the cerebellum, basal ganglia and motor cortex may stem from their highly preserved architecture in vertebrate species, which afford multiple converging sources of evidence as to their function ( ). \n\nThe roles of the parietal cortex and medial temporal lobe (MTL), however, are a matter of conjecture.\u00a0  suggest the parietal lobe combines the expected sensory consequences of movements (produced by the cerebellum;  ) with actual sensory feedback to generate state estimations (see also  ). Similarly, while   indicate that the MTL is independent to the acquisition of motor skills, Robertson proposes that MTL engagement increases with temporal task demands, and that it is involved in learning \u2018higher order\u2019 components of sequences (see  ). It is, however, notable that   primarily considered sensorimotor tasks, while   was specifically reviewing SRTT variants. Task specific differences both between these experimental paradigms and within their specific demands may therefore explain the presence or absence of activity in the MTL and SPL. \n\nThus, previous reviews highlight consistent roles for the basal ganglia, cerebellum and M1, while bringing forth conflicting views on the roles of the parietal cortex and MTL. It should be considered that these reviews, though informative, are primarily qualitative in nature, usually drawing inference from the results of relatively few key studies. This leaves scope for quantitative techniques that examine evidence from a broader spectrum of studies to be utilized to assess which areas of the brain consistently contribute to motor learning. \n\nCoordinate based meta-analyses can integrate the results of multiple neuroimaging studies across a field of research in a quantitative, unbiased fashion. Pooling data from multiple investigations provides opportunities to address several of the problems inherent to individual neuroimaging studies, such as their typically limited sample sizes (10\u201320 participants). Combining results from multiple investigations thus provides an opportunity to combat their relatively low statistical power. Individual neuroimaging studies are also sensitive to specific aspects of paradigm implementation and the particular contrasts examined. This can lead to diverging patterns of results between studies due to subtle differences in experimental design. Summarizing their results in a quantitative manner provides results that are less influenced by such study-specific \u2018noise\u2019. Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) provides a well established technique for quantitative voxelwise random effects meta-analysis ( ). This approach determines areas of significant spatial convergence based on peak activation coordinates reported in previous neuroimaging investigations. A key advantage of this coordinate-based approach is its principled statistical testing procedure against a null distribution to provide quantitative results. \n\nThe current investigation therefore utilized ALE to summarize the existing functional neuroimaging literature on motor learning and identify brain areas consistently activated during motor learning tasks. We hypothesized that an integration across all experiments would primarily reveal activations in motor cortical and cerebellar brain structures. Controlling for motor execution and for hand use during the tasks would allow further specification of areas that are involved in the higher level aspects of motor learning (as opposed to those simply involved in motor control). Furthermore, we hypothesized that while both sensorimotor and SRTT variant tasks would elicit activity in brain areas relating to motor preparation and execution, sensorimotor tasks would elicit greater activations in areas utilized to sense or predict the current state of the body and control movements. Finally, we hypothesized that areas that were demonstrated to be consistently activated across both sensorimotor and SRTT variant tasks would represent the \u2018core\u2019 areas essential to the motor learning network. \n\n\n## Material and methods \n  \n### Data used for the meta-analysis \n  \nStudies to be integrated in the current meta-analysis were obtained via PubMed literature searches ( , search strings \u201cmotor learning\u201d or \u201csequence learning\u201d) on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) experiments. Citations within these papers and previous qualitative reviews were examined to identify additional functional imaging studies to include in the analysis. Only publications reporting whole-brain analyses in standard reference space (Talairach/Tournoux, MNI) were included (coordinates reported in Talairach space were transformed into MNI coordinates using the Lancaster transformation;  ). Only results from group analyses of healthy adult participants were considered for further analysis; single subject reports and between-group comparisons were excluded. In cases where studies reported data from patient populations, only data from healthy controls was used. The sample was further restricted to examine only manual motor learning tasks, as the number of studies examining training with other effectors (e.g. the legs) was insufficient for meaningful analysis. As an examination of the eligible studies revealed that relatively few experiments presented data on training related decreases in activity associated with motor learning, the meta-analyses presented here examined only training related increases in activation. We do, however, present a summary of the data from analyses of training related decreases in activity in the supplementary materials, as it has been proposed that they may reflect important changes in the recruitment of brain areas that underlie motor learning (see  ). \n\nEach analysis was accompanied by two subanalyses that controlled for potentially confounding factors. In each case, the first subanalysis examined only experiments performed with the right hand. This controlled for activations relating to a potential mixture of lateralization effects. The right hand was chosen as the majority of studies examined tasks using the right hand, allowing maintenance of adequate sample sizes. The second of each of the subanalyses controlled for movement execution. This allowed activations relating to motor performance to be separated from those more specifically related to motor learning. This was achieved by excluding contrasts that compared motor learning with a rest condition, leaving only contrasts that involved a movement matched control condition. \n\n\n### Global analysis \n  \n70 experiments met the inclusion criteria. These experiments formed the basis for a global analysis; which was conducted as an integration of the entire current fMRI literature on motor-learning producing an objective, data driven overview. The global analysis included data from a total of 974 subjects and 954 activation foci. Details of the included experiments are presented in Supplementary Table 1. \n\nThe reporting of subject ages was not standardized across studies\u2014some reported group age ranges, some reported mean group ages, and some reported both. We ascertained extreme values of 18\u201371\u00a0years from studies reporting age ranges. From the 39 studies that provided mean ages, we calculated a mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD of 27.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.5\u00a0years. This number should be viewed with caution, however, for several reasons. First, several studies did not report mean age of their participants. Second, there was usually a broad range of age-distribution within each study, at least judging from those that did report measures of dispersion. Finally, a few studies also focused on somewhat older participants, usually in their fifties (e.g.,  ). Consequently, we would argue that the observed convergence should represent motor-learning related effects in generally younger to middle-aged subjects, while specific claims related to a particular age-group or even on age-related effects are not warranted from this data. \n\nA subanalysis examining only tasks performed with the right hand considered 39 experiments (456 subjects, 558 foci). A further subanalysis examining only contrasts that controlled for movement execution considered 47 experiments (695 subjects, 553 foci). \n\n\n### Paradigm specific analyses \n  \nTo examine differences between paradigm types, the entire pool of experiments was then separated into two subgroups: 35 \u2018sensorimotor tasks\u2019 and 35 \u2018SRTT variants\u2019. This distinction was based on the relative motor demands of the task. Sensorimotor tasks involved learning to produce new patterns of movement kinematics and/or dynamics. In contrast, SRTT variant tasks involved learning to perform skilled sequences of button presses with minimal novel motor components. All SRTT variant studies involved simple finger press responses to visual stimuli. There were, however, four key differences in implementation and analysis between SRTT variants. Firstly, the length of the repeating sequence varied between studies. Sequences consisted of between 5 and 18 items (Mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD\u00a0=\u00a08.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3 items). Secondly, participants were not always made aware of the presence of a repeating sequence. In explicit SRTT variants participants were informed that a repeating sequence of stimuli and hence reactions would be present. In implicit SRTT variants participants were not informed that a repeating sequence would be present. Thirdly, the hand used to perform the task was also varied. Across experiments, participants performed SRTT tasks with the left hand, the right hand, or bimanually. Finally, the contrast examined differed between studies. Some studies compared the repeating sequence condition to a random sequence condition (thus controlling for activations related to movement execution). Other studies compared the performance in the repeating sequence condition to a rest condition, or to an un-modeled baseline. It should therefore be noted while all contrasts examined included a sequence-learning component, some also included components that could be related to \u2018global\u2019 aspects of learning (i.e. the improvements due to repeated performance and/or greater familiarity with the task). This factor was accounted for in a sub-analysis that controlled for movement execution (i.e. included only tasks comparing learning a repeating sequence to a condition with a random sequence, thus controlling for global learning). Supplementary Table 1 presents a summary of the details for each study. \n\n#### Sensorimotor tasks \n  \nThe analysis of 35 sensorimotor tasks considered 473 subjects and 323 foci. Further subanalyses examined 20 sensorimotor tasks performed with the right hand (243 subjects, 165 foci) and 23 sensorimotor tasks that controlled for movement execution (348 subjects, 217 foci). \n\n\n#### SRTT variants \n  \nThe analysis of 35 SRTT variants considered 501 subjects and 631 foci. Complementary subanalyses considered 19 SRTT variants performed with the right hand (213 subjects, 393 foci) and 24 SRTT variants that controlled for movement execution (347 subjects, 336 foci). \n\n\n#### Contrast analyses: sensorimotor tasks vs SRTT variants \n  \nAn additional contrast analysis was also performed on the data from the two subgroups of tasks. This analysis was used to determine whether specific clusters of activity were more frequently associated with either sensorimotor tasks or SRTT variants. A further contrast analysis compared activations during explicit and implicit SRTT variants. This analysis aimed to determine whether explicit awareness of the presence of a repeating sequence led to stronger activation during SRTT variant tasks. \n\n\n#### Conjunction analysis \n  \nUsing masks from the global analysis in order to achieve greater specificity, the results from the analyses of sensorimotor tasks and SRTT variants were then submitted to conjunction analysis. This allowed determination of which structures were consistently activated across both types of task. Conjunctions of subanalyses were also created to provide further controls against potential confounds. \n\n\n#### Combined conjunction analysis: the \u2018motor learning core\u2019 \n  \nIn a final step, a combined conjunction analysis was conducted to determine which areas were activated regardless of task type and potential motor confounds. Areas surviving this conjunction are therefore likely to represent core areas for motor learning. \n\n\n\n### Analysis procedure \n  \nCoordinate based meta-analyses were conducted using the revised version of the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm ( ). The ALE algorithm identifies converging areas of activity across different experiments, empirically determining whether this clustering is greater than expected by chance. ALE captures the spatial uncertainty associated with reported coordinates, treating them as the centers for 3D Gaussian probability distributions ( ) with widths based on empirical between-subject and between-template comparisons ( ). The revised algorithm accounts for the increased spatial reliability of studies with larger sample sizes by modeling their activations using smaller Gaussian distributions ( ). The algorithm also accounts for comparisons between groups of unequal sizes by computing a null distribution under the assumption of label-exchangeability ( ). \n\nAll activation foci for a given experiment were combined for each voxel to produce a modeled activation map (MA map;  ). ALE scores describing the convergence of coordinates for each location were then calculated via the union of individual MA maps. To distinguish areas where the convergence between studies was greater than would be expected by chance (i.e. to separate true convergence from noise) ALE scores were compared to a nonlinear histogram integration based on the frequency of distinct MA values (see  ). As functional activations occur predominantly in grey matter areas, ALE scores were computed only for voxels with a \u2265\u00a010% probability of containing grey matter ( ). Results were thresholded at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 (cluster-level FWE, corrected for multiple comparisons, cluster-forming threshold at voxel level p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). \n\nAll contrast analyses were computed using the most recent version of the (random effects) ALE subtraction analysis ( ). Voxel-wise differences between ALE maps were first calculated for the two pools of experiments. The experiments contributing to either analysis were then pooled and randomly divided into two groups of equal size to the sets of contrasted experiments ( ). Voxelwise ALE scores for these two randomly assembled groups were subtracted from each other and recorded, and this process was repeated 10,000 times to yield an empirical null distribution of ALE score differences between the two conditions. The map of differences based on this procedure was then thresholded at a posterior probability for true differences of P\u00a0>\u00a00.95 and inclusively masked by the respective main effect of the minuend (cf.  ). \n\n\n### Labeling \n  \nAll results were anatomically labeled according to their most probable macroanatomical and cytoarchetectonic locations using the SPM Anatomy Toolbox ( ). Additional functional labels were obtained from a functional meta-analysis of cortical motor areas ( ). Peak maxima of the reported coordinates are presented in MNI space. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Global analysis of all tasks \n  \nThe global analysis examined all available studies in order to produce a data driven and objectively defined synthesis of the current neuroimaging literature on motor learning, and identify the network of brain areas that are commonly activated across all types of motor learning tasks. This global analysis examined all 70 experiments considered in the meta-analysis. Areas demonstrating significant convergence between experiments were the left dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC), bilateral supplementary motor cortex (SMC: comprising both the SMA-proper and pre-SMA), bilateral primary motor cortex (M1), left primary somatosensory cortex (S1), left superior parietal lobule (SPL), left thalamus, bilateral putamen, and multiple clusters in the cerebellum. These results are presented in  A. Coordinates of local maxima for all activations as well as details on their histological allocation using probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps are presented in  . \n\nTwo subanalyses controlled for effects of hand use and movement execution. A subanalysis examining all 39 experiments in which participants performed tasks using only their right hand identified consistent activity in the bilateral dPMC and SMA as well as left M1, right S1, bilateral SPL, left thalamus, and left putamen (see  B). A subanalysis that considered all 47 experiments that controlled for movement execution revealed activations in the bilateral dPMC, SMC, left SPL, and left thalamus (See  C). Coordinates of local maxima for these activations are presented in  . \n\n\n### Paradigm specific analyses \n  \nPotential differences between paradigm subtypes were then considered, in particular, due to the differing task demands of sensorimotor tasks (which have greater motor demands and focus on learning novel movement kinematics and dynamics and kinematics) and SRTT variants (which have minimal novel motor demands and focus on learning sequential motor behavior). \n\n#### Sensorimotor tasks \n  \nThe analysis of 35 sensorimotor tasks revealed consistent activation in left dPMC and bilateral M1 as well as the bilateral putamen, and multiple areas of the cerebellum. These results are presented in  A. A subanalysis of 20 right handed sensorimotor tasks revealed lateralized activity in the left dPMC, left M1 and bilateral putamen (see  B). A further subanalysis of 23 sensorimotor tasks that controlled for movement execution revealed only activity in the left dPMC (see  C). Peak activation foci for the sensorimotor analysis and subanalyses are presented in  . \n\n\n#### SRTT variants \n  \nAnalysis of the 35 SRTT variants revealed significant convergence between cortical foci in bilateral dPMC and SMC as well as left M1, left SPL, left thalamus and right cerebellum (see  A). A subanalysis restricted to the 19 SRTT variants performed using the right hand demonstrated significant activations in bilateral dPMC, right ventral PMC, bilateral SMC, left M1, left SPL, left thalamus and right cerebellum (see  B). A second subanalysis considering only the 24 SRTT variant experiments that controlled for movement execution found activations in the bilateral dPMC, left thalamus, and right cerebellum (see  C). Peak coordinates for the clusters identified in the SRTT variant analysis and subanalyses are presented in  . \n\n\n#### Contrast analysis: sensorimotor tasks vs SRTT variants \n  \nAs the next step, a contrast analysis was performed between the two pools of results from the task specific analyses, i.e., sensorimotor tasks and SRTT variants. This contrast analysis aimed to determine where in the brain activation was more strongly associated with sensorimotor tasks or SRTT variants. Greater convergence for SRTT variants than for sensorimotor tasks was found in multiple cortical areas, namely the bilateral dPMC, SMA and SPL (see  A). Subcortically, stronger convergence for the SRTT tasks was found within the left thalamus, and a small cluster in the right cerebellum ( B\u2013C). In contrast, multiple bilateral and superior medial areas of the cerebellum were found to demonstrate stronger convergence for sensorimotor as compared to SRTT tasks ( D\u2013F). Activation within the basal ganglia was also significantly more strongly associated with sensorimotor tasks ( G). \n\n\n#### Contrast analysis: implicit SRTT variants vs explicit SRTT variants \n  \nA further contrast analysis compared activations during explicit and implicit SRTT variants. This analysis revealed that activations in the bilateral dPMC and SMA, as well as in left SPL and thalamus were stronger when participants had explicit awareness of the presence of a repeating sequence, whereas only the head of the left caudate was more consistently recruited in implicit tasks (see  ). \n\n\n#### Conjunction analyses \n  \nA next step was to determine which areas were consistently activated across both subgroups of paradigms. Using the global analysis as a mask to provide greater specificity, a conjunction analysis was conducted across the task specific analyses of sensorimotor tasks and SRTT variants (the conjunction was thus based upon the  A,  A and  A). Clusters that survived this conjunction (and were hence consistently associated with motor learning across sensorimotor tasks and SRTT variants) were found in left dPMC, left M1, SMA proper and lobule VI of the right cerebellum (see  ). These activations are presented in  A. \n\nConjunctions of data from the subanalyses were also conducted. Using the results of the global analysis of all right handed tasks as a mask, a conjunction was computed over the right handed subanalyses for sensorimotor tasks and SRTT variants (i.e.  B,  B and  B). This conjunction analysis of right handed tasks revealed consistent converging activation in the left dPMC and left M1. The results of this conjunction are presented in  B. Peak coordinates for this conjunction analysis are reported in  . A conjunction of the movement controlled subanalyses was also conducted. This analysis, masked using the results of the movement controlled global analysis, was performed as a conjunction across the results from the motion-controlled analyses of sensorimotor tasks and SRTT variants (i.e.  C,  C and  C). This revealed activation only in the left dPMC (see  C,  ). \n\n\n#### Combined conjunction analysis: the \u2018motor learning core\u2019 \n  \nThis final step aimed to identify brain areas that represented the core structures for motor learning. This analysis was generated by creating a conjunction of results from the previous conjunction analyses (i.e. conjunction  A, B and C). The conjunction of their results revealed consistent activation of the left dPMC (peak coordinates in MNI space: \u2212\u00a026, 4, 60, activation presented in  D). \n\nTo assess the reliability of this activation, we conducted a highly conservative supplementary analysis examining only tasks that both used the right hand and controlled for movement execution (12 experiments). Like the combined conjunction analysis described above, this revealed activation of left dPMC when performing a conjunction across SRTT and sensorimotor tasks (see Supplementary Fig. 1). The results of the combined conjunction analysis, coupled with the highly conservative supplementary analysis, demonstrate the robust and consistent nature of the cluster of activity found in the left dPMC. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe study presented here assessed the network of brain areas that were consistently activated across 70 motor learning experiments. A global analysis revealed converging activations in dPMC, SMC, M1, S1, SPL, thalamus, putamen and the cerebellum. Further paradigm specific analyses indicated that these patterns of activity were similar across both sensorimotor tasks and SRTT variants. A contrast analysis, however, indicated that sensorimotor tasks led to more consistent activations in the left basal ganglia and bilateral cerebellum, while SRTT variants elicited more consistent activations in the bilateral dPMC, SMC, left SPL and left thalamus. A conjunction analysis nevertheless revealed a shared sub-network composed of the left dPMC, left M1, SMC and lobule VI of the right cerebellum was consistently recruited by both subgroups of task. Thus, while the contrast analysis indicated differences in activation likelihood, the overall pattern of results from the global and paradigm specific analyses demonstrate that a broadly similar network of structures underlies motor learning and performance across sensorimotor tasks and SRTT variants. Here we review the current evidence for the most likely roles of each of the structures identified in the meta-analysis. We also compare how the pattern of activation identified by the meta-analysis fits with previous models of motor learning. \n\n### Dorsal premotor cortex \n  \nWhile the meta-analysis revealed consistent converging activity in the dPMC, the laterality of its activation was highly task dependent. Sensorimotor tasks revealed convergence only in the left dPMC, while SRTT variants elicited converging bilateral dPMC activity. Subanalyses considering only experiments performed with the right hand revealed the same pattern of left unilateral activation for sensorimotor tasks and bilateral dPMC activation for SRTT variants. This indicates that the pattern of activation revealed was not simply a result of differences in hand use\u2014instead, the diverging patterns of activity are likely due to the differing demands of the sensorimotor task and SRTT variant subgroups.   have previously noted that hemispheric differences in PMC activity for SRTT variants may be accounted for by different aspects of learning. They suggest that the left PMC is activated during sequence acquisition, while the right PMC is involved during advanced stages of learning and in storage of sequences. Furthermore, the right PMC has been found to be active when participants learn purely perceptual components of the SRTT ( ). This is of particular relevance as the right dPMC was activated in subanalyses that controlled for movement execution. The consistent activation of the right dPMC during SRTT variants could therefore be attributed to participants learning advanced or perceptual (rather than movement execution related) aspects of sequence learning tasks. \n\nThe cluster of activity in the left dPMC was highly consistent, surviving the conjunction of analyses and the highly conservative supplementary analysis. The consistency of this activation indicates that the left dPMC is a structure of key importance for motor learning. In primates, the dPMC has both reciprocal connections with M1 and direct descending spinal projections, yet has a limited ability to directly contribute to movement execution ( ). These data thus indicate that the dPMC contributes to motor learning at a level above movement performance. Previous literature also indicates that the dPMC may contribute to motor learning by selecting appropriate responses according to visual cues ( ). In particular, the left dPMC appears to play a dominant role in movement selection (cf.  ); patients with lesions of the left dPMC show impaired response selection with either hand ( ), and TMS studies in healthy participants show that disrupting the left dPMC in healthy participants leads to increased reaction times when responding with either hand ( ). TMS of the left dPMC has also been demonstrated to disrupt the online updating of movements ( ). These multiple sources of converging evidence indicate that the dPMC plays a key role in the selection and updating of appropriate responses with either hand according to visual cues. These sources of evidence indicate that the left dPMC is an important structure for the visuomotor control of movement. \n\nThere is moreover evidence that the dPMC exhibits a continuum of visuomotor function. Rostral premotor areas contain a greater proportion of neurons with sensory properties while caudal premotor areas are more frequently associated with motor properties (see  ). This distinction is of particular relevance when considered in relation to a recent meta-analysis of working memory (see  ). Their results indicate that the left dPMC was specifically involved in encoding visuospatial information during working memory tasks. The locations of the left dPMC activation found by   and the left dPMC cluster found in the combined conjunction in the present meta-analysis are presented in  . While the clusters overlap, it is notable that the working memory related cluster was in a more rostral location. In comparison, the activation from the present meta-analysis of motor learning was in a relatively caudal position. These patterns of activity are therefore consistent with the left dPMC exhibiting a rostrocaudal continuum of activity from sensory to motor functions ( ). \n\nIn summary, our results provide evidence to support a functional lateralization of the dPMC. The right dPMC was only reliably activated during SRTT variants, which may be attributed to the role the right dPMC plays in the learning and storage of perceptual sequences. In contrast, the left dPMC was consistently activated across all analyses examined. Subanalyses indicated this pattern of activation occurred independently of movement execution and hand use. Comparisons with a previous meta-analysis of working memory indicated a rostrocaudal continuum of left dPMC activity from sensory to motor functions. Accordingly, activity of the left dPMC may relate to a dominant role in movement selection via visuomotor integration. This important role in visuomotor processing indicates that the left dPMC is a key structure in the network of brain areas that underlie motor learning. \n\n\n### Supplementary motor cortex \n  \nThe main analysis of all motor learning tasks revealed activity in both the SMA proper and the pre-SMA. This activity is consistent with the role of the SMC and adjacent cingulated regions in the self initiation of voluntary movements ( ). Task specific analyses indicated sensorimotor tasks activated only the SMA-proper, while SRTT variants activated both the SMA-proper and pre-SMA. The primate pre-SMA contains cells that respond to specific sequences of movements ( ), appearing to be important for linking conditional rules to actions. This role in sequence learning may explain why the pre-SMA was only consistently engaged during SRTT variants (which focus on learning sequences). Rostrally positioned (pre-SMA) areas are frequently involved in non-motor cognitive processes ( ). Activation of the pre-SMA during SRTT variants could therefore be attributed to their (more cognitive) task demands when compared to sensorimotor paradigms. Conversely, a recent study indicates that stimulation of the SMA-proper and not the pre-SMA can enhance motor learning in a sensorimotor task with a repeating sequential component ( ). It should, however, be noted that while both this task and SRTT variants include a sequential component, the requirements of the pinch task could be considered to have a greater weighting towards motor-execution related than cognitive aspects of motor learning. More caudally positioned (SMA-proper) regions of the SMC are linked with motor functions such as volitional action execution ( ). This is consistent with the activation of the SMA-proper across both SRTT variants and sensorimotor tasks. It is also notable that the SMC and dPMC, which together comprise the classical Brodmann area 6, both demonstrate a rostrocaudal shift of SMC activity from cognitive to motor function. \n\n\n### Primary motor cortex \n  \nSimilarly to the dPMC, M1 activations were revealed in both the global and task specific analyses, but the laterality of the activation depended greatly upon the subgroup of tasks examined. Bilateral M1 activations were present in the analysis of sensorimotor tasks, while SRTT variants revealed only left lateralized M1 activity. A subanalysis examining only tasks performed with the right hand revealed activity in the left M1 alone for both the SRTT variant and sensorimotor task subgroups. This is consistent with M1 activity reflecting use of the contralateral hand. Finally, no converging activations were found in M1 when an analysis was conducted only on tasks that controlled for movement execution. These results demonstrate that M1's involvement in motor learning occurs predominantly at the level of movement execution. This evidence appears to indicate that M1 plays a generally subservient role in motor learning. In spite of this, it should be noted that M1 has also been argued to be involved in the retention of learned movements via their repeated performance ( ). In particular, several models of motor learning consider muscle synergies to be instrumental in reducing movement variability in later learning to allow improved levels of skilled performance ( ). Hence, M1 may play a role in motor learning through use dependent mechanisms above the pure executive function indicated by our analyses. \n\n\n### Primary somatosensory cortex \n  \nThe global analysis revealed consistent loci of activity in S1. Task specific analyses indicated that this was driven by activity from sensorimotor learning tasks. While this may simply reflect that greater levels of sensory feedback are present during tasks with greater movement based demands, there is also evidence to suggest an active role for S1 during motor learning. Accurate sensory feedback comprises an important component of the forward modeling process thought to underlie motor learning through the correction of sensory prediction errors (for a recent review see  ). In animal models, somatosensory lesions have been demonstrated to impair the acquisition of new motor skills ( ). In humans, TMS studies have demonstrated that disrupting the normal function of S1 can interfere with motor learning when accurate sensory feedback is an important factor in performance ( ), and can even enhance performance when proprioceptive and visual feedback are in conflict ( ). These data thus seem to indicate that S1 may contribute to motor learning by processing sensory feedback information relevant to mechanisms of learning through error detection and correction. \n\n\n### Superior parietal lobule \n  \nConsistent activity of the left SPL (area 7A) was revealed in the global analysis of all tasks examined, and in the task specific analysis of SRTT variants. Subanalyses examining experiments performed with the right hand alone revealed similar patterns of activation: Bilateral area 7A activity was found when all right handed tasks were considered, but this activity was specific to the left hemisphere for SRTT variant tasks. In the subanalysis that controlled for movement execution, the left SPL was consistently activated in only the global analysis. The SPL is widely implicated in representation of the hands ( ). This focus on hand representation and the intimate interactions with the (dorsal) visual system may account for the consistent activity of the SPL in SRTT variants, which emphasize somatomotor hand control in response to visual stimuli. We found no consistent SPL activity in for sensorimotor tasks, which may reflect differences in parietal activation across the range of sensorimotor paradigms that have been examined. However,   have proposed that their model of a motor loop including the parietal cortex may not apply to certain sensorimotor tasks such as adaptation. \n\nOnly areas of the dPMC and SPL were found to be activated in subanalyses that controlled for movement execution. The primate dPMC receives afferent inputs from the SPL ( ), and these regions work in close cooperation to allow visuomotor control ( ). Transforming sensory input to motor output thus appears to involve a route from the SPL to M1 via the dPMC ( , cf.  ). Data from the present meta-analysis therefore supports the suggestion that the SPL integrates visual and somatosensory inputs, routing multimodal sensorimotor outputs to the dPMC, which in turn represents the key hub for motor learning and provides preparatory motor input into M1. \n\n\n### Thalamus and putamen \n  \nWhile the global analysis revealed significant convergence in both the thalamus and putamen, task specific analyses suggested an apparent double dissociation. Analysis of sensorimotor tasks demonstrated significant converging activity in the putamen alone, while analysis of SRTT variants revealed significant converging activity only in the thalamus. Further investigation, however, indicated that both regions are activated by both task types. If a true double dissociation existed, it would be expected that the clusters identified in the global analysis of all tasks would be due to SRTT variants alone in the case of the thalamus, and related to sensorimotor tasks alone in the case of the putamen. Examination of these clusters revealed that this was not the case. In particular, the respective \u201cpreferred\u201d type of task accounted for the majority of the activation probability (SRTT variants accounted for 71% of activity in the thalamus, while sensorimotor tasks accounted for 56/61% of activity in the left/right putamen). Thus both task types accounted for the majority of activation in the respective area, but also contributed approximately 30\u201345% of the activity of the other cluster. Further evidence indicating that both task types contributed to activity in both the thalamus and putamen was provided when data from the task specific analyses was considered at a reduced significance threshold (cluster-level uncorrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, while keeping the cluster-forming threshold at p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 at voxel level). Results indicated activity in both the Thalamus and the Putamen for both SRTT variants and sensorimotor tasks (see  ). Together, these sources of evidence indicate that both subgroups of tasks activate the thalamus as well as the putamen. Thus, while our results provide evidence for preferential activation, they do not represent a clear double-dissociation. Our results implicate a cortico-subcortical \u2018motor circuit\u2019 ( ), and are thus broadly consistent with models proposing that cortico-subcortical loops underlie motor learning ( ). \n\n\n### Cerebellum \n  \nThe global analysis of all tasks revealed clusters of bilateral activity occurring in the lateral Cerebellum (lobules V\u2013VI), and a further cluster in the right cerebellar vermis (lobules I\u2013IV). Task specific analyses, however, demonstrated that only activity in the right lateral cerebellum was consistent across both sensorimotor and SRTT variants. In contrast, activity in the left lateral cerebellum and vermis were present only in sensorimotor tasks. The cerebellum was more active during sensorimotor tasks, consistent with its role in the \u201cstate estimation\u201d process whereby predicted sensory consequences of actions are compared with actual sensory feedback (for a review see  ). State estimation allows the detection of prediction errors, which are essential for the adaptation and improved control of fast and accurate movements using feedforward control ( ). Previous research indicates the cerebellum plays a key role in the correction of prediction errors ( ), though only when large errors are introduced in a stepwise manner ( ). It is notable that the need for state estimation during sensorimotor tasks would be relatively high, as they involve learning novel patterns of movement. In contrast, the need for state estimation during SRTT variants would be relatively low due to the minimal motor component of the task (i.e. participants respond via primarily isometric button presses). Thus, we attribute the patterns of cerebellar activity revealed during sensorimotor tasks and SRTT variants to their differing demands on the process of state estimation. \n\n\n### Comparison with previous models of motor learning \n  \nSeveral previously established models propose that cortico-subcortical loops underlie motor learning tasks.   propose that a network of cortico-cerebellar structures primarily underlies learning in sensorimotor tasks, while a cortico-striatal system primarily underlies sequence learning tasks. Results of the present meta-analysis are in general agreement with this proposal. While both sensorimotor tasks and SRTT variant task paradigms relied on similar networks, the performed contrast analysis indicated that the cerebellum was more strongly associated with sensorimotor tasks, while the thalamus was more strongly associated with SRTT variants. Putamen recruitment was, however, contradictory to this model, being more closely linked with sensorimotor tasks. \n\n propose a somewhat contrasting framework with dual cortico-striatal-cerebellar loops for the associative and motor aspects of learning. While   limit this proposal to the acquisition and refinement of sequences, the present meta-analysis is in broad agreement with a logical extension of this model. In this context, it should be considered that SRTT variants are more likely to rely on the associative loop (as they involve strengthening stimulus\u2013response associations) while sensorimotor tasks are likely to rely more on the motor loop (as they involve refinement of motor performance). The similar patterns of cortical and cerebellar activity elicited during sensorimotor tasks and SRTT variants fit well with this premise. While the main analysis indicates the presence of a potential dichotomy in thalamus and putamen activity, further analyses indicated that both task types activate both structures (see \u201cThalamus and putamen\u201d subsection of discussion and   for details). \n\nActivations revealed in the present meta-analysis are therefore consistent with the proposal that cortico-cerebellar loops underlie motor learning ( ). The manner in which the identified areas work together is, however, still open to interpretation. Future investigations that model connectivity between the regions identified in the present meta-analysis will elucidate this issue. \n\nConflicting opinions exist regarding the involvement of the MTL in motor learning ( ). The results of the present meta-analysis indicate that the MTL is not part of the core network of brain areas that underlie motor learning for either sensorimotor tasks or SRTT variants. This finding could be considered as evidence that motor learning occurs independently of the MTL ( ). For an alternative viewpoint, it is of interest to consider that   proposes MTL engagement increases as the temporal and higher order demands of sequence learning tasks increase. It could, therefore be suggested that the series of SRTT variants included in the present meta-analysis did not have sufficient temporal or higher-order demands for the MTL to be consistently engaged across a majority of tasks. \n\n\n### Methodological considerations \n  \nWhile the tasks included in the present meta-analysis were divided into two subgroups (sensorimotor tasks, SRTT variants) of roughly equivalent size, the sensorimotor tasks presented a less homogenous group than the SRTT variants. The former could be considered an amalgamation of a number of smaller groups of paradigms (i.e. dexterous tasks, visuomotor tasks and phase coordination tasks). Unfortunately, the relatively low number of studies within each of these smaller groups would not have provided enough data to produce reliable results. \n\nCoordinate based meta-analyses of neuroimaging data pool results from studies that use similar contrasts. While a large majority of papers retrieved in the initial literature search presented data reporting activity related signal increases that occurred with motor training, only 1 in 3 studies reported training related decreases in activity. This represents an unfortunate imbalance in the literature, as examining training related decreases in activity in response to motor learning is of interest for several reasons. Firstly, motor training has been demonstrated to reduce the overall excitability threshold of the motor cortex ( ), indicating that training may lead to more efficient recruitment of motor structures. Secondly, it has been demonstrated that different areas of the brain are recruited during different stages of motor learning ( ). In this manner, decreasing activity revealed during fMRI studies may reflect changes due to increased efficiency, reduced errors, reduced co-contractions, and longer term changes underlying consolidation of learning. This underreporting of training related decreases in the literature may have occurred because experimenters simply did not consider investigating training related decreases. Alternatively, it could be due to underreporting of analyses that considered training related decreases which found null results, or results that were difficult to interpret. \n\nA final consideration is that coordinate based meta-analyses are largely insensitive to the time course of activations, which may play an important role in motor learning. For instance, evidence from sensorimotor learning tasks suggest that the cerebellum is activated during initial phases of learning when error is high, but shows reduced activity during later phases of learning when error is low (see  ). While coordinate based meta-analyses combine data from multiple studies to allow for robust inference on convergent findings, they are more likely to miss such temporal dynamics, as many studies do not report separate analyses related to time-dependent changes. Consequently, data will be pooled across different parts of the time-dependent changes during motor-learning. Thus, the results of the present study do not allow us to test the proposal that brain structures will contribute differentially to motor learning over time (see  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe ALE meta-analysis presented here for the first time allowed the quantitative integration of the current neuroimaging literature on motor learning. It revealed consistent activity across paradigms in the dPMC, SMC, M1, S1, SPL, thalamus, putamen and cerebellum. This pattern of activations is broadly consistent with previously proposed models of the key structures involved in motor learning ( ), and the proposal cortico-subcortical loops may drive motor learning ( ). \n\nContrast analyses indicated that activity in the basal ganglia and cerebellum were more frequently (though not exclusively) associated with sensorimotor tasks, consistent with their proposed roles in selective reinforcement of motor programs and the detection of sensorimotor prediction errors. In comparison, activity of the dPMC, SMC, SPL and thalamus was more consistently associated with SRTT variants, consistent with their proposed roles in visuomotor integration and response selection. Despite these differences, a conjunction analysis of our global and task specific analyses revealed that the left dPMC, SMC, left M1 and right cerebellar areas were consistently activated across both SRTT variants and sensorimotor tasks. These results indicate that a consistent network of neural structures contributes to motor learning and performance across a range of paradigms despite their varying kinematic and dynamic demands. A result of particular interest was the finding that the left dPMC was consistently activated across both task types, regardless of motor execution confounds. This result thus reveals a key role for the left dPMC in sensorimotor integration and response selection during motor learning tasks. The results of the present meta-analysis thus indicate that the left dPMC is a key structure in the network of brain areas that underlie motor learning. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 3555187, "text_md5": "abf4ac31f63f70c68e760450ef433171", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 84], "journal": [85, 95], "publication_year": [97, 101], "title": [112, 188], "keywords": [202, 324], "abstract": [337, 2392], "body": [2401, 53857]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 23194819, "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.11.020", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3555187", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3555187"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3555187\">3555187</a>", "list_title": "PMC3555187  A quantitative meta-analysis and review of motor learning in the human brain"}

In this study, we addressed the highly debated question of whether neural responses previously linked to affect sharing could result from the perception of salient affective displays. Moreover, we investigated how the brain network involved in affect sharing and self-other distinction underpinned our response to a pain that is either perceived as genuine or pretended (while in fact both were acted for reasons of experimental control). We found stronger activations in regions associated with affect sharing (anterior insula [aIns] and anterior mid-cingulate cortex) as well as with affective self-other distinction (right supramarginal gyrus [rSMG]), in participants watching video clips of genuine vs. pretended facial expressions of pain. Using dynamic causal modeling, we then assessed the neural dynamics between the right aIns and rSMG in these two conditions. This revealed a reduced inhibitory effect on the aIns to rSMG connection for genuine pain compared to pretended pain. For genuine pain only, brain-to-behavior regression analyses highlighted a linkage between this inhibitory effect on the one hand, and pain ratings as well as empathic traits on the other. These findings imply that if the pain of others is genuine and thus calls for an appropriate empathic response, neural responses in the aIns indeed seem related to affect sharing and self-other distinction is engaged to avoid empathic over-arousal. In contrast, if others merely pretend to be in pain, the perceptual salience of their painful expression results in neural responses that are down-regulated to avoid inappropriate affect sharing and social support. \n   eLife digest  \nEmpathy enables us to share and understand the emotional states of other people, often based on their facial expressions. This empathic response involves being able to distinguish our own emotional state from someone else\u2019s, and it is influenced by how we recognize that person\u2019s emotion. In real life, knowing and identifying whether the facial expression we are witnessing reflects genuine or pretended pain is particularly important so that we can appropriately react to someone\u2019s emotions and avoid unnecessary personal distress. \n\nHow our brains manage to do this is still heavily debated. Two areas, the anterior insular (aIns for short) and the mid-cingulate cortex, appear to be activated when someone \u2018feels\u2019 someone else\u2019s pain. However, these regions might just automatically be triggered by vivid emotional facial expressions, regardless of whether we really respond to that pain. \n\nTo examine this question, Zhao et al. measured brain activity as healthy adults watched video clips of people either feeling or pretending to feel pain. The activation of aIns was particularly related to the emotional component that someone shared with another person\u2019s genuine pain, but not to pretended pain. This suggests that neurons in the aIns track a truly empathic response when seeing someone who is actually experiencing pain. \n\nEffective connectivity analyses which reflect how brain areas \u2018crosstalk\u2019 also revealed distinct patterns when people viewed expressions of genuine, as opposed to pretended pain. Zhao et al. focused on the interactions between the alns and the right supramarginal gyrus, a brain region which helps to distinguish another person\u2019s emotions from our own. This crosstalk tracked others\u2019 feelings when participants viewed expressions of genuine but not of pretended pain. \n\nPut together, these findings provide a more refined model of empathy and its neural underpinnings. This will help further our understanding of conditions such as autism or depression, in which a person\u2019s social skills and emotional processing are impaired. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAs social beings, our own affective states are influenced by other people\u2019s feelings and affective states. The facial expression of pain by others acts as a distinctive cue to signal their pain to others, and thus results in sizeable affective responses in the observer. Certifying such responses as evidence for empathy, however, requires successful self-other distinction, the ability to distinguish the affective response experienced by ourselves from the affect experienced by the other person. \n\nStudies using a wide variety of methods convergently have shown that observing others in pain engages neural responses aligning with those coding for the affective component of self-experienced pain, with the anterior insula (aIns) and the anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC) being two key areas in which such an alignment has been detected ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  , for meta-analyses). However, there is consistent debate on whether activity observed in these areas should indeed be related to the sharing of pain affect or whether it may not rather result from automatic responses to salient perceptual cues \u2013 with pain vividly expressed on the face being one particularly prominent example ( , for review). It was thus one major aim of our study to address this question. In this respect, contextual factors, individuals\u2019 appraisals, and attentional processes would all impact their exact response to the affective states of others ( ;  , for review;  ;  ;  ). Recently,   have thus proposed a framework that attempts to capture these influences on affect sharing and empathic responses. This model posits that individuals who see identical negative facial expressions of others may have different empathic responses due to distinct contextual information and that this may depend on identification of the underlying affective state displayed by the other. In the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we therefore created a situation where we varied the genuineness of the pain affect felt by participants while keeping the perceptual saliency (i.e., the quality and strength of pain expressions) identical. To this end, participants were shown video clips of other persons who supposedly displayed genuine pain on their face vs. merely pretended to be in pain. Note that for reasons of experimental control, all painful expressions on the videos had been acted. This enabled us to interpret possible differences between conditions to the observers\u2019 appraisal of the situation rather than to putative visual and expressive differences. This way, we sought to identify the extent to which responses in affective nodes (such as the aIns and the aMCC) genuinely track the pain of others, rather than resulting predominantly from the salient facial expressions associated with the pain. \n\nAnother major aim of our study was to assess how self-other distinction allowed individuals to distinguish between the sharing of actual pain vs. regulating an inappropriate and potentially misleading \u2018sharing\u2019 of what in reality is only a pretended affective state. We focused on the right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG), which has been suggested to act as a major hub selectively engaged in   affective   self-other distinction ( ;  ;  ;  ). Though previous studies have indicated that rSMG is functionally connected with areas associated with affect processing ( ;  ), we lack more nuanced insights into how exactly rSMG interacts with these areas, and thus how it supports accurate empathic responses. Hence, we used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to investigate the hypothesized brain patterns of affective responses and self-other distinction for the genuine and pretended pain situations, focusing on the aIns, aMCC, and their interaction with rSMG. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between neural activity and behavioral responses as well as empathic traits. In line with the literature reviewed above, we expected that, on the behavioral level, genuine pain would result in \u2013 alongside the obvious other-oriented higher pain ratings \u2013 higher self-oriented unpleasantness ratings. On the neural level, we predicted aIns and aMCC to show a stronger response to the genuine expressions of pain, but that these areas would also respond to the pretended pain, but to a lower extent. Differences in rSMG engagement and distinct patterns of this area\u2019s effective connectivity with aIns and aMCC were expected to relate to self-other distinction, and thus to explain the different empathic responses to genuine pain vs. pretended pain. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nThree repeated-measures ANOVAs were performed with the factors   genuineness   (genuine vs. pretended and   pain   [pain vs. no pain]), for each of the three behavioral ratings. For ratings of painful   expressions   in others ( , left), there was a main effect of the factor genuineness: participants showed higher ratings for the genuine vs. pretended conditions, F  (1, 42) = 8.816, p=0.005, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.173. There was also a main effect of pain: participants showed higher ratings for the pain vs. no pain conditions, F  (1, 42) = 1718.645, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.976. The interaction term was significant as well, F  (1, 42) = 7.443, p=0.009, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.151, and this was related to higher ratings of painful expressions in others for the genuine pain compared to the pretended pain condition. For ratings of painful feelings in others ( , middle), there was a main effect of genuineness: participants showed higher ratings for the genuine vs. pretended conditions, F  (1, 42) = 770.140, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.948. There was also a main effect of pain, as participants showed higher ratings for the pain vs. no pain conditions, F  (1, 42) = 1544.762, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.974. The interaction for painful feelings ratings was significant as well, F  (1, 42) = 752.618, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.947, and this was related to higher ratings of painful feelings in others for the genuine pain compared to the pretended pain condition. For ratings of unpleasantness in self ( , right), there was a main effect of genuineness: participants showed higher ratings for the genuine vs. pretended conditions, F  (1, 42) = 74.989, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.641. There was also a main effect of pain: participants showed higher ratings for the pain vs. no pain conditions, F  (1,42) = 254.709, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.858. The interaction for unpleasantness ratings was significant as well, F  (1, 42) = 73.620, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.637, and this was related to higher ratings of unpleasantness in self for the genuine pain compared to the pretended pain condition. In sum, the behavioral data indicated higher ratings and large effect sizes of painful feelings in others and unpleasantness in self for the genuine pain compared to the pretended pain condition. Ratings of pain expressions also differed in terms of genuineness, at comparably low effect size, though they were expected to not show a difference by way of our experimental design and the pilot study. \n   fMRI experimental design and behavioral results.  \n(  A  ) Overview of the experimental design with the four conditions genuine vs. pretended, pain vs. no pain. Examples show static images, while in the experiment participants were shown video clips. (  B  ) Overview of experimental timeline. At the outset of each block, a reminder of \u2019genuine\u2018 or \u2019pretended\u2018 was shown (both terms are shown here for illustrative purposes, in the experiment either genuine or pretended was displayed). After a fixation cross, a video in the corresponding condition appeared on the screen. Followed by a short jitter, three questions about the video were separately presented and had to be rated on a visual analogue scale. These would then be followed by the next video clip and questions (not shown). (  C  ) Violin plots of the three types of ratings for all conditions. Participants generally demonstrated higher ratings for painful expressions in others, painful feelings in others, and unpleasantness in self in the genuine pain condition than in the pretended pain condition. Ratings of all three questions were higher in the painful situation than in the neutral situation, regardless of whether in the genuine or pretended condition. The thick black lines illustrate mean values, and the white boxes indicate a 95% CI. The dots are individual data, and the \u201cviolin\u201d outlines illustrate their estimated density at different points of the scale. (  D  ) Correlations of painful feelings in others and unpleasantness in self for the genuine pain and the pretended pain (the relevant questions were highlighted with a green rectangular). Results revealed a significant Pearson correlation between the two questions in the genuine pain condition, but no correlation in the pretended pain condition. The lines represent the fitted regression lines, bands indicate a 95% CI. \n  \nWe also found a significant correlation between behavioral ratings of painful feelings in others and unpleasantness in self in the genuine pain condition, r = 0.691, p<0.001, while in the pretended pain condition, the correlation was not significant, r = 0.249, p=0.107 ( ). A bootstrapping comparison showed a significant difference between the two correlation coefficients, p=0.002, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) = [0.230, 1.060]. \n\n\n### fMRI results: mass-univariate analyses \n  \nThree contrasts were computed: (1) genuine: pain \u2013 no pain, (2) pretended: pain \u2013 no pain, and (3) genuine (pain \u2013 no pain) \u2013 pretended (pain \u2013 no pain). Across all three contrasts, we found activations as hypothesized in bilateral aIns, aMCC, and rSMG (  and  ). \n   Neuroimaging results: mass-univariate analyses.  \n(  A  ) Activation maps of genuine: pain \u2013 no pain (top), pretended: pain - no pain (middle), and genuine (pain \u2013 no pain) \u2013 pretended (pain \u2013 no pain) (bottom). As expected, we found brain activations in the bilateral aIns, aMCC, and rSMG in all three contrasts (except for the bottom contrast, where the right aIns is only close to the significance threshold). (  B  ) The multiple regression analysis demonstrated significant clusters in the left (peak: [\u201342, 15,\u20132]) and right anterior insular cortex (peak: [45, 5, 8]) that were positively correlated with the ratings of unpleasantness in self comparing genuine pain vs. pretended pain. All activations are thresholded with cluster-level family-wise error correction, p<0.05 (p<0.001 uncorrected initial selection threshold). The lines of the scatterplots represent the fitted regression lines, bands indicate a 95% confidence interval (CI). \n     Results of mass-univariate functional segregation analyses in the MNI space.    \nTo identify whether or which brain activity was selectively related to the behavioral ratings described above, we performed a multiple regression analysis where we explored the relationship of activation in the contrast genuine pain \u2013 pretended pain with the three behavioral ratings. We found significant clusters in bilateral aIns, visual cortex, and cerebellum that could be selectively explained by the ratings of self-unpleasantness rather than ratings of painful expressions in others or painful feelings in others ( ). \n\n\n### DCM results \n  \nWe performed DCM analysis to specifically examine the modulatory effect of genuineness on the effective connectivity between the right aIns and rSMG. More specifically, we sought to assess whether the experimental manipulation of genuine pain vs. pretended pain tuned the bidirectional neural dynamics from aIns to rSMG and vice versa, in terms of both directionality (sign of the DCM parameter) and intensity (magnitude of the DCM parameter). If the experimental manipulation modulated the effective connectivity, we would observe a strong posterior probability (p >0.95) of the modulatory effect. Our original analysis plan was to include aMCC in the DCM analyses, but based on the fact that aMCC did not show as strong evidence (in terms of the multiple regression analysis) as the aIns of being involved in our task, we decided to use a more parsimonious DCM model without the aMCC. \n\nWe found strong evidence of inhibitory effects on the aIns to rSMG connection both in the genuine pain condition and in the pretended pain condition ( ). Comparing the strength of these modulatory effects on the aIns to rSMG connection revealed a reduced inhibitory effect for genuine pain as opposed to pretended pain, t  = 2.671, p=0.011 (mean  = \u22120.821, 95% CI = [\u22120.878, \u22120.712]; mean  = \u22120.934, 95% CI = [\u22121.076, \u22120.822];  ). There was no evidence of a modulatory effect on the rSMG to aIns connection. \n   DCM results and brain-behavior analyses.  \n(  A  ) ROIs included in the DCM: aIns (blue; peak: [33, 29, 2]) and rSMG (green; peak: [41, \u201339, 42]). (  B  ) Posterior probability of modulatory effects for the genuine pain and the pretended pain. (  C  ) The group-average DCM model. Green arrows indicate neural excitation, and orange arrows indicate neural inhibition. Importantly, we found strong evidence of inhibitory effects on the connection of aIns to rSMG for both the genuine pain condition and the pretended pain condition. Values without the bracket quantify the strength of connections and values in the bracket indicate the posterior probability of connections. All DCM parameters of the optimal model showed greater than a 95% posterior probability (i.e., strong evidence) except for the intrinsic connection of aIns to rSMG (  p   = 0.80). Paired sample t-test showed less inhibitory effects of the aIns-to-rSMG connection for the genuine pain than the pretended pain. This result is highlighted with a gray rectangular. Data are mean \u00b1 95% CI. (  D  ) The multiple linear regression model revealed a positive correlation between the inhibitory effect and painful feelings in others and not with the other two ratings for genuine pain but no correlation for pretended pain. \n  \n\n### Individual associations between modulatory effects, behavioral ratings, and questionnaires \n  \nTo examine how the modulatory effects from the DCM were related to the behavioral ratings, we computed two multiple linear regression models for each condition. For the genuine pain condition, we find that the modulatory effect was significantly related to the rating of painful feelings in others (t = 2.317, p=0.026), but not related to the rating of either painful expressions in others (t = \u22121.492, p=0.144) or unpleasantness in self (t = 0.058, p=0.954). For the pretended pain condition, none of the ratings was significantly related to the modulatory effect ( ). The variance inflation factors (VIFs) for three ratings in both models were calculated to diagnose collinearity, showing no severe collinearity problem (all VIFs < 5; the smallest VIF = 1.132 and the largest VIF = 4.387). \n\nIn addition, we tested two multiple stepwise linear regression models to investigate whether subscales of all three questionnaires could explain modulatory effects for genuine pain and pretended pain. In the genuine pain condition, we found that the modulatory effect was significantly explained by scores of two subscales, that is affective ability and affective reactivity of the ECQ: F  (1, 39) = 6.829, p=0.003, R  = 0.270; B  = 0.052, beta = 0.497, p=0.002; B  = \u22120.040, beta = \u22120.421, p=0.008. No significant predictor was found with the other questionnaires (i.e., IRI and TAS). In the pretended pain condition, none of the three questionnaires significantly predicted variations of the modulatory effect. No severe collinearity problem was detected for either regression model (all VIFs < 2; the smallest VIF = 1.011 and the largest VIF = 1.600). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we developed and used a novel experimental paradigm in which participants watched video clips of persons who supposedly either genuinely experienced pain or merely pretended to be in strong pain. Combining mass-univariate analysis with effective connectivity (DCM) analyses, our study provides evidence on the distinct neural dynamics between regions suggestive of affect processing (i.e., aIns and aMCC) and self-other distinction (i.e., rSMG) for genuinely sharing vs. responding to pretended, non-genuine pain. With this, we aimed to clarify two main questions: First, whether neural responses in areas such as the aIns and aMCC to the pain of others are indeed related to a veridical sharing of affect, as opposed to simply tracking automatic responses to salient affective displays. And second, how processes related to self-other distinction, implemented in the rSMG, enable appropriate empathic responses to genuine vs. merely pretended affective states. \n\nThe mass-univariate analyses suggest that the increased activity in aIns for genuine pain as opposed to pretended pain properly reflects affect sharing. As aforementioned, the network of affective sharing and certain domain-general processes (e.g., salience detection and automatic emotion processing) overlap in aIns and aMCC ( , for review). This indicates that indeed, part of the activation in these areas could be related to perceptual salience, which is why it has been widely debated as a potential confound of empathy and affect sharing models ( , for review;  , for review). However, when comparing genuine pain versus pretended pain, activity in these areas was not only found to be stronger in response to genuine pain, but the increased activation in aIns was also selectively correlated with ratings of self-oriented unpleasantness and was not correlated with either other-related painful expressions or painful feelings in terms of the regression analysis. That only aIns and not also aMCC shows such correlation may be explained by previous studies, according to which aIns is more specifically associated with affective representations, while the role of aMCC rather seems to evaluate and regulate emotions that arise due to empathy ( ;  ;  ). Taken together, the activation and brain-behavior findings provide evidence that responses in aIns (and to a lesser extent also the aMCC) are not simply automatic responses triggered by perceptually salient events (otherwise the increased aIns activation should also be explained by other behavioral ratings in the sense of shared influence by domain-general effects). Rather, they seem to track the actual affective states of the other person, and thus the shared neural representation of that response (see  , for similar recent conclusions based on multi-voxel pattern analyses). Our findings are also in line with the proposed model of  , which suggests that affect sharing is the consequence of emotion identification. More specifically, while part of the activation in the aIns and aMCC is indeed related to an (presumably earlier) automatic response, the added engagement of these areas once they have identified the pain as genuine shows that only in this condition, they then also engage in proper affect sharing. Ideally, one should be able to discern these processes in time, but neither the temporal resolution of our fMRI measurements nor the paradigm in which we always announced the conditions beforehand would have been sensitive enough to do so. Thus, future studies including complementary methods, such as EEG and MEG, and tailored experimental designs are needed to pinpoint the exact sequence of processes engaged in automatic affective responses vs. proper affect sharing. \n\nBeyond higher activation in affective nodes supporting (pain) empathy, increased activation was also found in rSMG. The inferior parietal lobule was shown to be generally engaged in selective attention, action observation, and imitating emotions ( ;  ;  ;  ). Importantly, a specific role in affective rather than cognitive self-other distinction has been identified for rSMG ( ;  ;  ). Based on such findings, it has been proposed that the rSMG allows for a rapid switching between or the integration of self- and other-related representations, as two processes that may underpin the functional basis of successful self-other distinction ( , for review). Theoretical models of empathy and related socio-affective responses suggest that such regulation is especially important to avoid so-called empathic over-arousal, which would shift the focus away from empathy and the other\u2019s needs, toward taking care of one\u2019s own personal distress ( , for review;  , for review). Concerning the current findings, we thus propose that the higher rSMG engagement in the genuine pain condition reflects an increasing demand for self-other distinction imposed by the stronger shared negative affect experienced in this condition. \n\nBeyond these differences in the magnitude of rSMG activation, the DCM analysis demonstrated less inhibition on the aIns-to-rSMG connection for genuine pain compared to pretended pain. Note that our focus on the right aIns rather than bilateral aIns was because it is located in the same hemisphere as the right SMG. Various theoretical accounts suggest that areas such as the aIns and rSMG may play a key role in comparing self-related information with the sensory evidence ( , for review;  , for review). According to recent theories on predictive processing ( , for review) and active inference ( , for review), the brain can be regarded as a \u201cprediction machine\u201d, in which the top-down signals pass over predictions and the bottom-up signals convey prediction errors across different levels of cortical hierarchies ( ;  , for review;  ). It is suggested that these top-down predictions are mediated by inhibitory neural connections ( ;  ;  ). Our findings align with such views, by suggesting that the inhibitory connection from aIns to rSMG can be explained as the predictive mismatch between the top-down predictions of self-related information (e.g., personal affect) and sensory inputs (e.g., pain facial expressions). This suppression of neural activity leads to an   explaining away   of incoming bottom-up prediction error. This is reflected by the absence of any condition-dependent modulatory effects on the rSMG to aIns connection, suggesting that the influence of the task conditions is sufficiently modeled by the predictions from aIns to rSMG. Therefore, the stronger inhibition for pretended pain, compared to genuine pain, could indicate a higher demand to overcome the mismatch between the visual inputs and the agent\u2019s prior beliefs and contextual information about the situation (i.e., \u201cthis person looks like in pain, but I know he/she does not actually feel it\u201d). We speculate that a dynamic interaction between sensory-driven and control processes is underlying the modulatory effect: when individuals realized after an initial sensory-driven response to the facial expression that it was not genuinely expressing pain, control, and appraisal processes led to a reappraisal of the triggered emotional response, and thus a dampening of the unpleasantness. The reduced inhibition in the genuine pain condition could moreover be a mechanism that explains the higher rSMG activation in this condition. \n\nModel comparison showed that the best model to explain the inhibitory effect with the behavioral ratings for both the genuine and pretended pain is the model without interactions between ratings. That is, if any behavioral rating contributed to the modulation of aIns to rSMG, the effect would be more likely coming from single ratings rather than their interactions. Specifically, we found the strength of the inhibitory effect in the genuine pain condition to correlate with ratings of painful feelings in others, but not with the ratings of pain expression in others or unpleasantness in self. For the pretended pain condition, none of the ratings showed a correlation. The latter could in principle be due to a lack of variation in the ratings (which by way of the design were mostly close to zero or one). We deem it more plausible, though, that the correlation findings provide further evidence that the modulation of aIns to rSMG is implicated in encoding others\u2019 emotional states, which serves as a functional foundation for self-other processing when participants engaged in genuine affect sharing. This regulation cannot be totally attributed to domain-general processes, otherwise other ratings should have also explained this variation. It is also interesting to note that the found correlation relates to cognitive evaluations of the other\u2019s pain rather than to own affect, as tracked by the unpleasantness in self-ratings. This would to some extent be in line with DCM findings by  . These authors found that the inhibition of the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) by the aIns was linked to interactions between Theory of Mind (ToM) and empathic distress, that is the interaction of \u2018cognitive\u2019 vs. \u2018affective\u2019 processes engaged in understanding others\u2019 cognitive and affective states. Note that the right TPJ is an overarching area involved in self-other distinction of which rSMG is considered a part or at least closely connected to  , for review. \n\nThe correlations between the DCM inhibitory effect and empathic traits assessed via questionnaires provide further refinements for the relevance of rSMG in implementing self-other distinction to allow for an appropriate empathic response. When participants shared genuine affect, the inhibitory effect on the aIns to rSMG connection was positively correlated with affective ability and negatively correlated with affective reactivity. Affective ability reflects the capacity to subjectively share emotions with others, while affective reactivity plays a role in the susceptibility to vicarious distress and thus to more automatic responses to another\u2019s emotion ( ). Again, as for the correlations with the three rating scales, we did not find correlations of empathic traits for the pretended pain condition. Taken together, the DCM results and their qualification by the correlation findings suggest that in the genuine pain condition, which requires an accurate sharing of pain, rSMG interacts with aIns to achieve \u2018affective-to-affective\u2019 self-other distinction \u2013 that is disambiguating affective signals originating in the self from those attributable to the other person. The aIns to rSMG connection in the pretended pain condition may reflect a related, yet slightly distinct mechanism. Here, it seems that \u2018cognitive-to-affective\u2019 self-other distinction is at play, which helps resolve conflicting information between the top-down contextual information (i.e., that the demonstrator is not actually in pain) from what seems an unavoidable affective response to the highly salient perceptual cue of the facial expression of pain. Given our behavioral and trait data did not allow us to distinguish more precisely between these different types of self-other distinction, this however remains an interpretation and a hypothesis that will require further investigation. This inhibitory effect might be related to socioemotional disturbances of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), who show impairments in social cognition, including self- and other-related processing ( ;  , for review). It is thus likely that ASD individuals exhibit distinct inhibition of the aIns-to-rSMG connectivity pattern compared to healthy controls. Further research with ASD individuals is required. \n\nOne potential limitation of the study could be the slightly higher ratings of other-oriented pain expressions for genuine pain, which were hypothesized to have no difference, as compared to pretended pain. As we found the enhanced aIns activation in the genuine pain condition mainly tracked personal unpleasantness rather than perceptually domain-general processes, and because the effect size of the pain expression difference was much smaller than for the affect ratings, we consider this difference did not fundamentally influence the interpretation of our findings. An additional limitation was that our study design did not aim to explicitly quantify self-other distinction. Rather, in line with previous research and based on our theoretical framework and rationale, we inferred the engagement of this process from the experimental conditions and the associated behavioral and neural responses. We expect our findings to prompt and inform future research designed to quantify and experimentally disentangle self- and other-related processes more explicitly. Note though that our participants and the targets shown in the videos were balanced with respect to their sex/gender. Yet sex/gender effects (for a review, though, see  ) were outside the scope of the current study, and we thus did not perform any sex/gender-related analyses. \n\nIn conclusion, the current study advances our understanding of two main aspects of empathy. First, we provide evidence that empathy-related responses in the aIns can indeed be linked to affective sharing, rather than attributing them to responses triggered only by perceptual saliency. Second, we show how aIns and rSMG are orchestrated to track what another person really feels, thus enabling us to appropriately respond to their actual needs. Beyond these basic research insights, our study provides novel avenues for clinical application, and the investigation of contextual and interpersonal factors in the accurate diagnosis of pain and its expression. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nForty-eight participants took part in the study. Five of them were excluded because of excessive head motion ( >15% scans with the frame-wise displacement over 0.5 mm in one session). Data of the remaining 43 participants (21 females; age: Mean = 26.72 years, S.D. = 4.47) were entered into analyses. This sample size was determined on a priori power analysis in Gpower 3.1 ( ). We assumed a medium effect size of Cohen\u2019s   d   = 0.5. After calculation, the minimum sample size statistically required for this study was 34 (  \u03b1   = 0.05, two-tailed, 1\u2212  \u03b2   = 0.80). Participants were pre-screened by an MRI safety-check questionnaire, assuring normal or corrected to normal vision and no presence or history of neurologic, psychiatric, or major medical disorders. All participants were being right-handed (self-reported) and provided written consent including post-disclosure of any potential deception. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna and was conducted in line with the latest version of the  . \n\n\n### Manipulation of facial expressions \n  \nAs part of our study, we developed a novel experimental design and corresponding stimuli, which consisted of video clips showing different demonstrators ostensibly in four different situations: (1) Genuine pain: the demonstrator\u2019s right cheek was penetrated by a hypodermic needle attached to a syringe, and the demonstrator\u2019s facial expression changed from neutral to a strongly painful facial expression. (2) Genuine no pain: the demonstrator maintained a neutral facial expression when a Q-tip fixed on the backend of the same syringe touched their right cheek. (3) Pretended pain: the demonstrator\u2019s right cheek was approached by the same syringe and the hypodermic needle, with the latter covered by a protective cap; upon touch by the cap, the demonstrator\u2019s facial expression changed from neutral to a strongly painful facial expression. (4) Pretended no pain: the demonstrator maintained a neutral facial expression when a Q-tip fixed on the backend of the same syringe touched their right cheek. \n\nTo create these stimuli, we recruited 20 demonstrators (10 females), with experience in acting, and filmed them in front of a dark blue background. An experimenter who stood on the right side of the demonstrators, but of whom only the right hand holding the syringe could be seen, administered the injections and touches. Unbeknownst to the participants, all painful expressions were acted, as the needle was a telescopic needle (i.e., a needle that seemed to enter the cheek upon contact, but in reality, was invisibly retracting into the syringe). The reason for using a protective cap in the pretended pain condition was to match the perceptual situation that an aversive object was approaching a body part in both pain conditions. In all situations, the demonstrator was instructed to look naturally toward the camera 1.5 m in front of them. As soon as the needle or the cap touched the demonstrator\u2019s cheek, the demonstrator made a painful facial expression, as naturally and vividly as possible. In the neutral control conditions, demonstrators maintained a neutral facial expression when a Q-tip fixed at the backend of the syringe touched their cheek. Again, a syringe with a needle attached to the other end was used to perceptually control for the presence of an aversive object in all four conditions. Note that in another set of conditions, demonstrators showed disgusted or neutral expressions. Data from these conditions will be reported elsewhere. All demonstrators signed an agreement that their video clips and static images could be used for scientific purposes. \n\n\n### Stimulus validation and pilot study \n  \nTo validate the stimuli, we performed an online validation study with N = 110 participants, who were asked to rate a total of 120 video clips of 2 s duration of the two conditions (60 of each condition) showing painful expressions (i.e., the genuine and the pretended pain conditions). The main aim of the validation study was to identify a set of demonstrators that expressed pain with comparable intensity and quality, and whose pain expressions in the genuine and pretended conditions were comparable. After each video clip, participants rated three questions on a visual analog scale with nine tick-marks and the two end-points marked as \u2018almost not at all\u2019 to \u2018unbearable\u2019: (1) How much pain did the person   express   on his/her face? (2) How much pain did the person   actually   feel? (3) How   unpleasant   did you feel to watch the person in this situation? The order of these three questions was pseudo-randomized. Moreover, eight catch trials randomly interspersed across the validation study to test whether participants maintained attention to the stimuli. Here, participants were asked to correctly select the demonstrator they had seen in the last video, between two static images of the correct and a distractor demonstrator displayed side by side, both showing neutral facial expressions. \n\nThe validation study was implemented within the online survey platform SoSci Survey ( ), with a study participation invite published on Amazon Mechanical Turk ( ), a globally commercial platform allowing for online testing. Survey data of 62 of 110 participants (34 females; age: mean = 28.71 years, S.D. = 10.11) were entered into analysis (inclusion criteria: false rate for the test questions < 2/8, survey duration > 20 min and <150 min, and the maximum number of continuous identical ratings < 5). Based on this validation step, we had to exclude videos of six demonstrators (three females) for which participants showed a significant difference in painful expressions in others between the genuine pain and the pretended pain conditions. As a result of this validation, videos of 14 demonstrators (7 females), which showed no difference in the pain   expression   rating between genuine and pretended conditions and which overall showed comparable mean ratings in all three ratings, were selected for the subsequent pilot study. \n\nIn the pilot study, 47 participants (24 females; age: mean = 26.28 years, S.D. = 8.80) were recruited for a behavioral experiment in the behavioral laboratory. The aim was to verify the experimental effects and the feasibility of the experimental procedures that we intended to use in the main fMRI experiment, as well as to identify video stimuli that may not yield the predicted responses. Thus, all four conditions described above were presented to the participants. Participants were explicitly instructed that they would watch other persons\u2019 genuine painful expressions in some blocks, while in other blocks, they would see other persons acting out painful expressions (recall that in reality, all demonstrators had been actors, and the information about this type of necessary deception was conveyed to participants at the debriefing stage). They would see all demonstrators\u2019 neutral expressions as well. Participants were instructed to rate the three questions mentioned above. Upon screening for video clips that showed aberrant responses, we excluded videos of two demonstrators (one female), for whom the pain   expression   rating difference between the pretended vs. genuine expressions was large. Forty-eight videos of 12 demonstrators entered the following analyses. Three separate repeated-measures ANOVAs were respectively performed for the three rating questions. For the main effect of   genuineness   (genuine vs. pretended), it was not significant and low in effect size for painful expressions in others (F  (1, 46) = 2.939, p=0.093, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.060), but was significant with high effect size for the painful feelings in others (F  (1, 46) = 280.112, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.859) as well as the unpleasantness in self (F  (1, 46) = 43.143, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.484). The main effects of   pain   (pain vs. no pain) for all three questions were found significant with high effect size (the smallest effect size was for the rating of unpleasantness in self, F  (1, 46) = 82.199, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.641). Our pilot study thus (1) provided assuring evidence that the novel experimental paradigm worked as expected and (b) made it possible to select video clips that we could match for the two conditions (i.e., genuine pain and pretended pain). More specifically, as expected and required for the main study, participants rated the painfulness of the demonstrators to be substantially higher when it was genuine as compared to those that were pretended, and this also resulted in much higher unpleasantness experienced in the self. It is worth noting that, the two conditions did not differ with respect to the ratings of the painful facial expressions, implying that putative differences in ratings as well as the subsequent brain imaging data could only be attributed to the contextual appraisal of the demonstrators\u2019 actual painful states, rather than the differences in facial pain perception. Based on this pilot study, we thus decided on video clips of 12 demonstrators (6 females) in the main fMRI experiment. \n\n\n### Experimental design and procedure of the fMRI study \n  \nThe experiment was implemented using Cogent 2000 (version 1.33;  ). MRI scanning took place at the University of Vienna MRI Center. Once participants arrived at the scanner site, an experimenter instructed them that they would watch videos from the four conditions outlined above. Participants were explicitly instructed to recreate the feelings of the demonstrators shown in the videos as vividly and intensely as possible. Based on the validation and pilot study, the painful   expressions   for the genuine and pretended conditions were matched. We also counterbalanced the demonstrators appearing in the genuine and pretended conditions across participants, thus controlling for differences in behavioral and brain response that could be explained by differences between the stimulus sets. Note that, all video clips were validated and piloted multiple times to ensure the experimental effect (details can be found in the section above). \n\nThe participant performed the fMRI experiment in two runs ( ). Each run was composed of two blocks showing genuine pain and two blocks showing pretended pain. In each block, the participant watched nine video clips containing both painful and neutral videos. To remind participants\u2019 the condition of the upcoming block, a label of 4 s duration appeared at the beginning of each block, showing either \u2018genuine\u2019 or \u2018pretended\u2019 (in German). Each trial started with a fixation cross (+) presented for 4\u20137 s (in steps of 1.5 s, mean = 5.5 s). After that, the video (duration = 2 s) was played. A short jitter was inserted after the video for 0.5\u20131.0 s (in steps of 0.05 s, mean = 0.75 s). After the jitter, the following three questions were displayed (in German) one after the other in a pseudo-randomized order: (1) How much pain did the person   express   on his/her face? (2) How much pain did the person   actually feel  ? (3) How   unpleasant did you feel   to watch the person in this situation? Beneath each question, a visual analog scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 8 (unbearable) with nine tick-marks was positioned. The participant moved the marker along the scale by pressing the left or right keys on the button box, and they pressed the middle key to confirm their answer. The marker initially was always located at the midpoint (\u20184\u2019) of the scale. When the confirmed key was pressed, the marker turned from black to red. All ratings lasted for 4 s even when the participant pressed the confirmed key before the end of this period. Between the two runs, the participant had a short break (1\u20132 min). \n\nBefore entering the scanner, participants conducted practice trials on the computer to get familiarized with the button box and the experimental interface. After that, participants were moved into the scanner and performed the task. Following the functional imaging runs, a 6.5 min structural scanning was employed. When participants finished the scanning session, they were scheduled for a date to complete three questionnaires in the lab: the Empathy Components Questionnaire (ECQ) ( ;  ), the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) ( ), and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) ( ). For the ECQ, there are 27 items in total to be categorized into five subscales: cognitive ability, cognitive drive, affective ability, affective drive, and affective reactivity, using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\u2018strongly disagree\u2019) to 4 (\u2018strongly agree\u2019) ( ;  ). For the IRI, there are 28 items divided into four subscales: perspective taking, fantasy, empathic concern, and personal distress, using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (\u2018does not describe me well\u2019) to 4 (\u2018describes me very well\u2019) ( ). For the TAS, there are 20 items and three subscales \u2013 difficulty describing feelings, difficulty identifying feelings, and externally oriented thinking, using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\u2018strongly disagree\u2019) to 5 (\u2018strongly agree\u2019) ( ). The average interval between the scanning session and the lab survey was 1 week. The participant was debriefed after completing the whole study. \n\n\n### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nWe applied repeated-measures ANOVAs to investigate the main effects and the interaction of the two factors genuine vs. pretended and pain vs. no pain, using SPSS (version 26.0; IBM). Furthermore, we conducted Pearson correlations to examine whether ratings of painful feelings in others were correlated with unpleasantness in self for the genuine pain and the pretended pain. The correlation coefficients were further compared using a bootstrap approach with the R package bootcorci [  ( )]. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nfMRI data were collected using a Siemens Magnetom Skyra MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), with a 32-channel head coil. Functional whole-brain scans were collected using a multiband-accelerated T2*-weighted echoplanar imaging sequence (multiband acceleration factor = 4, interleaved ascending acquisition in multi-slice mode, 52 slices co-planar to the connecting line between anterior and posterior commissure, TR = 1200 ms, TE = 34 ms, acquisition matrix = 96 \u00d7 96 voxels, FOV = 210 \u00d7 210 mm , flip angle = 66\u00b0, inter-slice gap = 0.4 mm, voxel size = 2.2 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 2 mm ). Two functional imaging runs, each lasting around 16 min (~800 images per run), were performed. Structural images were acquired with a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (TE/TR = 2.43/2300 ms, flip angle = 8\u00b0, ascending acquisition, single-shot multi-slice mode, FOV = 240 \u00d7 240 mm , voxel size = 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 mm , 208 sagittal slices, slice thickness = 0.8 mm). \n\n\n### fMRI data processing and mass-univariate functional segregation analyses \n  \nImaging data were preprocessed with a combination of Nipype ( ) and MATLAB (version R2018b 9.5.0; MathWorks), with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12;  ). Raw data were imported into BIDS format ( ). Functional data were subsequently preprocessed using slice timing correction to the middle slice ( ), realignment to the first image of each session, co-registration to the T1 image, segmentation between gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, normalization to MNI template space using Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) toolbox ( ), and smoothing with a 6 mm full width at half-maximum three-dimensional Gaussian kernel. \n\nTo improve data quality, we performed data scrubbing of the functional scans for those whose frame-wise displacements (FD) were over 0.5 mm ( ;  ). In other words, we identified individual outlier scans and flagged the volume indices as nuisance regressors in the general linear model (GLM) for the first-level analysis. \n\nIn order to perform mass-univariate functional segregation analyses, a first-level GLM design matrix was created and composed of two identically modeled runs for each participant. Seven regressors of interest were entered in each model: stimulation phase of the four conditions (i.e., genuine pain, genuine no pain, pretended pain, pretended no pain; 2000 ms) and rating phase of the three questions (i.e., painful expressions in others, painful feelings in others, and unpleasantness in self; 12,000 ms). Six head motion parameters and the scrubbing regressors (FD > 0.5 mm, if applicable) were additionally entered as nuisance regressors. Individual contrasts of the four conditions and the three ratings (all across the two runs) against implicit baseline were respectively created. \n\nOn the second level, a flexible factorial design was employed to perform the group-level analysis. The design included three factors: a between-subject factor (i.e., subject) that was specified independent and with equal variance, a within-subject factor (i.e., genuine or pretended) that was specified dependent and with equal variance, and a second within-subject factor (i.e., pain or no pain) that was specified dependent and with equal variance ( ). Three contrasts were computed: (1) main effect of genuine: pain \u2013 no pain, (2) main effect of pretended: pain \u2013 no pain, and (3) interaction: genuine (pain \u2013 no pain) \u2013 pretended (pain \u2013 no pain). We applied an initial threshold of p<0.001 (uncorrected) at the voxel level and a family-wise error (FWE) correction (p<0.05) at the cluster level. The cluster extent threshold was determined by the SPM extension \u2018cp_cluster_Pthresh.m\u2019 ( ). \n\n\n### Brain-behavior relationships \n  \nA multiple regression model was built on the group level to investigate the relationship between specific brain activations and behavioral ratings. In this model, the contrast genuine pain \u2013 pretended pain was set as the dependent variable, and differences between conditions for three behavioral ratings were specified as independent variables. The reason that we used the comparison between conditions for both brain signals and behavioral ratings was to control for potential effects of perceptual salience. All covariates were mean-centered. An intercept was added in the model. To test whether the order of entering ratings into the regression model influence the results, we performed five additional regression analyses with all possible orders of three ratings. The results were consistent across all six regression models, and we only showed the result for one regression (i.e., expression+ feeling + unpleasantness) in the Results section. Note that, we performed the regression model with the contrast genuine pain \u2013 pretended pain instead of the more exhaustive contrast genuine (pain - no pain) - pretended (pain \u2013 no pain), and this was because the genuine and the pretended pain conditions were the main focus of our work. Moreover, the pain contrast showed more robust (in terms of statistical effect size) and widespread activations across the brain, making it more likely to pick up possible brain-behavior relationships. The same threshold as above was applied in this analysis. \n\nWe aimed to assess these brain-behavior relationships for the following regions of interest (ROI): (1) aIns and aMCC, that is two regions associated with affective processes and specifically with empathy for pain, (2) rSMG, an area implicated in affective self-other distinction. The ROI masks were defined as the conjunction of the averaging contrast between genuine and pretended: pain \u2013 no pain (threshold: voxel-wise FWE correction,   P   < 0.05) and the anatomical masks created by the Wake Forest University (WFU) Pick Atlas SPM toolbox ( ) with the automated anatomical atlas (AAL). The ROI masks were created with Marsbar ROI Toolbox implemented in SPM12 ( ). Note that we specifically selected the ROIs this way, such that they were orthogonal (i.e., independent) to the subsequent analyses of interest. As exploratory analyses found significant correlations mainly in aIns, rather than in aMCC, we will focus in the results section on two ROIs: the right aIns and the rSMG. Focusing on the right aIns instead of the left one was because the right aIns is on the ipsilateral hemisphere as rSMG. \n\n\n### Analyses using DCM \n  \nTo investigate the functional network involved in affective processes and self-other distinction and how it was modulated by our experimental manipulations (i.e., genuine pain and pretended pain), we used DCM to estimate the effective connectivity between the ROIs based on the tasked-related brain responses ( , for review). The DCM analyses were conducted with DCM12.5 implemented in SPM12 (v. 7771). First, we extracted individual time series separately for each ROI. To ensure the selected voxels engaged in a task-relevant activity but not random signal fluctuations, we determined the voxels both on a group-level threshold and an individual-level threshold ( ). An initial threshold was set as p<0.05, uncorrected. The significant voxels in the main effect of genuine pain and pretended pain were further selected by an individual threshold. For each participant, an individual peak coordinate within the ROI mask was searched, and an individual mask was consequently defined using a sphere of the 6 mm radius around the peak. As a result, the individual time series for each ROI was extracted from the significant voxels of the individual mask and summarized by the first eigenvariate. One participant was excluded as no voxels survived significance testing. Second, we specified three regressors of interest: genuine pain, pretended pain, and the video input condition (the combination of genuine pain and pretended pain). That we did not specify no-pain conditions was because (1) the pain conditions were our main focus, and (2) adding no-interest conditions would inevitably increase the model complexity. Then, a fully connected DCM model for each participant was created. Three parameters were specified: (1) bidirectional connections between regions and self-connections (matrix A), (2) modulatory effects (i.e., genuine pain and pretended pain) on the between-region connections (matrix B), and (3) driving inputs (i.e., the video input condition) into the model on both regions (matrix C) ( ). To remain parsimonious, we did not set modulatory effects on the self-connections in matrix A. Then the full DCM model was individually estimated. Finally, group-level DCM inference was performed using parametric empirical Bayes ( ). We conducted an automatic search over the entire model space (max. n = 256) using Bayesian model reduction and random-effects Bayesian model averaging, resulting in a final group model that takes accuracy, complexity, and uncertainty into account ( ). The threshold of the Bayesian posterior probability was set to p >0.95 (i.e.,   strong evidence  ) but we reported all parameters above p >0.75 (i.e.,   positive evidence  ) for full transparency of the DCM results. Finally, a paired sample t-test was performed to compare modulatory effects between the genuine pain and the pretended pain conditions. \n\nTo probe whether task-related modulatory effects were associated with behavioral measurements, we performed multiple linear regression analyses of modulatory parameters with (1) the three behavioral ratings and (2) the empathy-related questionnaires (i.e., IRI, ECQ, and TAS). We set up regression models for the genuine pain condition and the pretended pain condition, respectively, in which the DCM parameters of modulatory effects were determined as dependent variables and the ratings of painful expressions in others, painful feelings in others, and unpleasantness in self as independent variables. Considering that interactions between behavioral ratings might contribute to the regression model, we tested five regression models (with and without interaction; See  ) for both genuine pain and pretended pain. Results showed that for both genuine pain and pretend pain, the model without any interaction outperformed other models. The results of the winning multiple regression model are reported in the Results section. We performed additional two regression models for both conditions in which DCM modulatory effects were set as dependent variables and scores of each subscale of all questionnaires were set as independent variables, respectively. Considering the number of independent variables was relatively large (>10), we performed the analyses for questionnaires using a stepwise regression approach. As two participants did not complete all three questionnaires, we excluded their data from the regression analyses. The statistical significance of the regression analysis was set to p<0.05. The multicollinearity for independent variables was diagnosed using the VIF that measures the correlation among independent variables, in the R package car ( ). Here we used a rather conservative threshold of VIF < 5 as a sign of no severe multicollinearity ( ;  ). \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8443248, "text_md5": "dca9c6e9bd78001831627ad76c73c030", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 79], "journal": [80, 85], "publication_year": [87, 91], "title": [102, 256], "keywords": [270, 387], "abstract": [400, 4210], "body": [4219, 58496]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 34409940, "doi": "10.7554/eLife.69994", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8443248", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8443248"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8443248\">8443248</a>", "list_title": "PMC8443248  Neural dynamics between anterior insular cortex and right supramarginal gyrus dissociate genuine affect sharing from perceptual saliency of pretended pain"}

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, neural and behavioural responses to individually calibrated and intensity-matched painful stimuli from both modalities were compared. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nPain thresholds were comparable across groups, but visceral thresholds correlated with gastrointestinal symptom severity and chronic stress burden exclusively within UC. Upon experience of visceral and somatic pain, both control groups demonstrated enhanced visceral pain-induced neural activation and greater perceived pain intensity, whereas UC patients failed to differentiate between pain modalities at both behavioural and neural levels. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWhen confronted with acute pain from multiple bodily sites, UC patients\u2019 responses are distinctly altered. Their failure to prioritise pain arising from the viscera may reflect a lack of adaptive behavioural flexibility, possibly resulting from long-lasting central effects of repeated intestinal inflammatory insults persisting during remission. The role of psychological factors, particularly chronic stress, in visceral sensitivity and disease-specific alterations in the response to acute pain call for dedicated mechanistic research as a basis for tailoring interventions for intestinal and extraintestinal pain symptoms in IBD. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Glossary of Terms Related to Pain Research \n      \n\n## 1. Introduction \n  \nAbdominal pain is reported by up to 80% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD],  typically in concert with other gastrointestinal [GI] symptoms, such as altered bowel habits, that characterise phases of acute disease. Even during clinical remission, however, pain persists in a substantial proportion of patients.  Furthermore, pain is not confined to the GI tract but may also arise from the musculoskeletal system or the joints as part of extraintestinal disease manifestations.  Effective treatment of abdominal pain remains a major challenge.  In fact, one in four patients reports their IBD-related pain to be untreated,  with detrimental effects on health-related quality of life.  Despite its clinical relevance, research on the mechanisms of pain perception and underlying neural circuits in IBD remains limited, especially in ulcerative colitis [UC]. \n\nMost of the mechanistic research on pain in IBD has focused on pain sensitivity, ie, on thresholds for experimentally applied painful stimuli [for a definition of terms related to pain research, see Glossary]. For the visceral pain modality, pain thresholds assessed by rectal distensions are reportedly lower during active disease,  indicating visceral hypersensitivity which appears to persist during remission mainly in patients presenting with ongoing symptoms despite adequate control of intestinal inflammation.  In this subgroup, the clinical presentation mirrors that of irritable bowel syndrome [IBS], a primarily non-inflammatory disorder of gut-brain interactions, motivating research into distinct and common mechanisms in these conditions.  Regarding sensitivity for pain arising from bodily regions like the skin or muscle [ie, somatic pain], higher pain thresholds [ie, hyposensitivity] but comparable perceived pain intensities have been observed in IBD.  Together, these data support modality-specific alterations in pain sensitivity possibly driven at least in part by recurring inflammation in IBD. \n\nDespite relevance to pain chronicity, disease burden, and treatment, the subjective experience of pain, contributing factors, and underlying neural mechanisms which have been broadly studied in IBS  remain incompletely understood in IBD. Experimental studies assessing behavioural responses to somatic or visceral pain stimuli are scarce and have yielded inconsistent results.  Putative alterations in the neural processing of experimental pain in IBD, which might persist during phases of disease remission, also remain elusive.  To investigate central pain mechanisms in the context of the gut-brain axis, novel experimental protocols with painful stimuli from different modalities applied within one brain imaging session, so called \u2018multiple threat paradigms\u2019, have more recently been implemented.  These were designed to model the experience of multiple symptoms arising from the viscera and other bodily sites, reflecting patients\u2019 clinical reality of aversive intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms. For mechanistic research into brain mechanisms relevant to understanding the normal and adaptive specificity of pain responses for the visceral modality, these paradigms have also proven to be highly instrumental. Indeed, when repeatedly confronted with visceral and somatic painful stimuli matched to intensity, healthy volunteers perceive visceral stimuli as more unpleasant, fear-evoking, and threatening.  Distinct differences are also observable at the level of neural representations of visceral versus somatic pain,  in line with a proposed greater biological salience of visceral signals  which appears to shape perception and pain-related cognitive and emotional responses such as learning and memory processes. \n\nHerein, for the first time, we report on behavioural and neural responses in a multiple-threat paradigm with visceral [ie, rectal distensions] and somatic [ie, thermal cutaneous] pain stimuli in patients with IBD [ie, UC in clinical remission], patients with IBS, and healthy controls. We directly compared responses to visceral and somatic pain stimuli to elucidate if altered pain processing in chronic visceral pain patients is confined to the GI tract [ie, the visceral modality] or applies more broadly to other pain modalities. To address the specificity of the pain experience to clinical condition, which can inform us about putative mechanisms underlying pain persistence beyond the resolution of acute inflammation in UC, we included IBS as a patient control group. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nAll volunteers were recruited by public advertisement between the years 2015 and 2019 at the University Hospital Essen, Germany, for a comprehensive study on different aspects of visceral and somatic pain, including behavioural testing and several brain imaging sessions. The screening process consisted of a standardised telephone screening, followed by a personal interview and a medical examination, including a digital rectal examination to exclude perianal tissue damage [eg, haemorrhoids, fissures, sphincter damage] which may interfere with rectal distensions used as visceral pain stimuli. Given the female preponderance of chronic visceral pain in disorders of gut-brain interactions  and evidence of sex/gender differences specifically for the visceral modality,  only women were recruited for all groups. Pregnancy was ruled out using a commercially available pregnancy test [Biorepair GmbH, Sinsheim, Germany, sensitivity 10 mIU/ml] on the day of the study. Besides male sex/gender, general exclusion criteria for all participants included age\u2005<18 or\u2005>65 years, body mass index\u2005<18 or\u2005>30, the usual magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]-specific exclusion criteria [eg, claustrophobia, ferromagnetic implants], and structural brain abnormalities [verified by neuroradiologist].   For the UC group  , only patients in clinical remission were included to avoid interference of active disease with study-related procedures, and to minimise putative effects of acute inflammation [or medical treatments required during phases of disease exacerbation] on study measures. Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids within 4 weeks of the study was exclusionary. Clinical disease activity was assessed based on symptom reports, initially evaluated in a structured screening interview, and then quantified with the Clinical Activity Index [CAI],  which allows classification of current disease activity based on the total sum score into inactive [ie, remission;\u2005\u22644], mild activity [5\u201310], moderate activity [11\u201317], and high activity [\u226518].  Here, the symptom-based version of the CAI was used, excluding one item concerning laboratory results [ie, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and haemoglobin; for a detailed description, see \u00d6hlmann   et al.  . Only patients with symptom-based CAI scores\u2005\u22644 [ie, clear remission] were enrolled. In addition, as a non-invasive biological marker of intestinal inflammation,  levels of faecal calprotectin served as an additional criterion, using the established reliable cut-off value of below 150 \u03bcg/g of stool indicating biomarker remission.  As time delays between initial screening and scheduling of the study day were not always avoidable, a standard procedure was implemented to ascertain that no changes in disease status or current medications occurred. To this end, every patient who fulfilled all criteria and had provided informed consent was contacted via telephone 7\u20138 days before the scheduled testing session. Symptoms were re-assessed to ensure clinical remission, and patients were instructed to collect the faecal sample, which was directly sent to the laboratory by the patients. In case clinical remission could not be ascertained based on either symptom report or faecal calprotectin levels, the study session was rescheduled.   For the IBS group  , symptom-based confirmation of diagnostic criteria was based on ROME IV criteria.  For both patient groups  , an existing and confirmed diagnosis of the respective GI disorder established at least 1 year prior to recruitment for this study was required. Minor and stable [or successfully treated] psychological symptoms, such as mild anxiety or depression symptoms [indicated by elevated scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS,  described in detail below] were not exclusionary, whereas patients with diagnosed, more severe psychiatric comorbidities [such as schizophrenia/psychotic disorders, substance use disorders, borderline personality disorder] were excluded. Note that given frequent reporting of additional extraintestinal pain symptoms in IBS and IBD,  patients who reported such symptoms in addition to symptoms of their primary GI diagnoses were not excluded.   For healthy controls  , additional exclusion criteria were any somatic or mental health conditions based on self-report or scores above the published cut-offs in HADS, frequent GI complaints,  or regular use of any medications [except hormonal contraceptives or thyroid medication]. Of note, data from a larger sample of healthy participants, recruited in parallel to patient cohorts, have previously been used within a published study on pain-related learning and memory in health,  which however did not contain data for the analysis carried out herein. The healthy sample used herein was a subset tested by the same study team and matched to the two patient groups based on age. Work was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study was approved by the local Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Essen [protocol number 10-4493]. All volunteers gave written informed consent and received monetary compensation for participation. \n\n\n### 2.2. Psychosocial and clinical questionnaires \n  \nParticipants completed a comprehensive psychosocial and clinical symptom questionnaire battery that included assessment of GI symptoms, pain, anxiety, depression, and chronic stress. GI symptoms were quantified with a standardised questionnaire that we routinely use in our group, as it is applicable across visceral pain conditions as well as in healthy volunteers.  A range of typical GI symptoms [ie, diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, nausea, lower abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, heartburn, post-prandial fullness, bloating, loss of appetite] in the previous 3 months is assessed using a Likert-type response scale [ie, an ordinal scale where ordered categories are provided as options to choose from: 0\u2005=\u2005experience never, 1\u2005=\u2005experience once or twice per month, 2\u2005=\u2005experience once or twice per week, 3\u2005=\u2005experience more than twice a week], and total sum scores can be calculated for analyses. Additionally, the Brief Pain Inventory [BPI ] was administered. In two subscales, pain severity and pain-related interference with function is assessed. For a mean pain severity score, the intensity of the least, average, and worst pain within the last 24 hours as well as current pain intensity are assessed and averaged. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were evaluated by the HADS,  which consists of two subscales with seven items measuring anxiety [HADS-A] and depression [HADS-D], respectively. For each subscale, available cut-off values differentiate between non-cases [sub-scale score\u2005<8], potential cases [subscale score 8\u201310], and probable cases [subscale score\u2005\u226511] of anxiety and depression.  To assess chronic stress, the 12-item screening scale of the Trier Inventory of Chronic Stress [TICS-SSCS] was used.  The scale evaluates individual experiences with chronic stressors in everyday life and provides a reliable global measure of perceived stress during the past 3 months,  with higher scores indicating greater perceived stress. For TICS, norm values are available for healthy volunteers with a mean score of 13, corresponding to T\u2005=\u200550. \n\n\n### 2.3. Experimental pain models \n  \nFor the visceral modality, pressure-controlled rectal distensions were accomplished using a barostat system [modified ISOBAR 3 device, G & J Electronics, Toronto, ON, Canada]. The inflatable balloon allows for precise and graded distensions of the rectum inducing mild, intermediate or strong sensations of urgency, discomfort, and pain.  These sensations closely resemble the aversive visceral symptoms regularly experienced by patients with UC and IBS, which are also encountered by healthy controls, albeit less frequently and intensely. For the somatic modality, cutaneous thermal pain stimuli were applied on the left ventral forearm using a thermode [PATHWAY model CHEPS; Medoc Advanced Medical Systems, Ramat Yishai, Israel]. Note that for safety reasons, the maximum pressure applied with the rectal balloon was limited to 60 mmHg and for the thermode a temperature limit was set to 50\u00b0C. \n\n\n### 2.4. Experimental procedures \n  \nAn overview of experimental procedures is provided in  . On the study day, visceral and somatic pain thresholds were initially determined based on ratings of gradually increasing stimulus intensities, as previously accomplished.  Individual pain thresholds served as anchor for the subsequent calibration and matching procedures. During calibration, stimulus intensities for each pain modality were identified based on perceived pain intensity ratings within the target range of 60 to 80 mm on digitised visual analogue scales [VAS] with endpoints labelled \u2018not painful\u2019 [0] and \u2018extremely painful\u2019 [100], respectively. This procedure allows the determination of individual stimulation intensities [distension pressure for the visceral modality and temperature for the somatic modality] inducing adequately painful sensations for use in within-subject application of repeated pain stimuli during brain imaging. Afterwards, to ensure comparability across modalities, visceral and somatic perceived pain intensities were matched. For this purpose, visceral stimuli were presented together with thermal stimuli and participants were asked to compare the stimuli using Likert-type response options indicating more, less, or equally painful stimuli. If the rating showed a deviation, the intensity of thermal stimuli was successively adjusted until ratings indicated equal perception at least twice consecutively. As in our previous work,  stimulus durations were adjusted for each individual, aiming at matched durations of ascending [increasing pressure and temperature, respectively] and plateau phases [stable pressure and temperature, respectively] of visceral and thermal stimulation [total stimulus duration per stimulus: 20 s]. The stimulation intensities resulting from the matching procedure in patients with UC were comparable to those in healthy volunteers and patients with IBS, for both thermal stimuli [UC: 45.43\u2005\u00b1\u20050.36\u00b0C; HC: 45.20\u2005\u00b1\u20050.30\u00b0C; IBS: 43.83\u2005\u00b1\u20050.70\u00b0C] and rectal distensions [UC: 32.60\u2005\u00b1\u20051.87 mmHg; HC: 38.16\u2005\u00b1\u20052.25 mmHg; IBS: 34.78\u2005\u00b1\u20052.15 mmHg]. \n  \n[A] Schematic and [B] narrative overview of experimental procedures. A detailed description of pain models and implementation [eg, pseudorandomisation, timing] is provided in Sections 2.3 and 2.4, respectively. \n  \nSubsequently, a structural brain scan was accomplished to exclude brain abnormalities and to ensure optimal settings [duration: ~5 min], immediately followed by the multiple-threat paradigm inside the MR scanner. Functional MRI was conducted to assess blood oxygenation level-dependent [BOLD] responses, indicating neuronal activity, to a total of 10 painful stimuli [five visceral, five somatic, implemented in pseudorandomised order], using the calibrated and matched pain stimulus intensities. Prior to stimulus presentation, a fixation cross was presented on the screen [with jittered durations 6\u201312 s], and after each stimulus, participants rated the perceived pain intensity on digitised VAS [presented for 9 s] as described above, using an MR-compatible hand-held fibre-optic response system [LUMItouchTM, Photon Control, Burnaby, BC, Canada]. An OFF phase [ie, black screen with a white frame] with jittered durations between 4.6 and 6.9 s followed each rating. \n\n\n### 2.5. Brain imaging and analyses \n  \nStructural and functional brain images were acquired on a 3 Tesla MR scanner using a 32-channel head coil [Skyra, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany]. For structural imaging, a 3D-MPRage T1-weighted sequence was used (repetition time [TR] 1900 ms, echo time [TE] 2.13 ms, flip angle 9\u00b0, field of view [FOV] 239\u2005\u00d7\u2005239 mm , 192 slices, slice thickness 0.9 mm, voxel size 0.9\u2005\u00d7\u20050.9\u2005\u00d7\u20050.9 mm , matrix 256\u2005\u00d7\u2005256 mm , Generalized Partially Parallel Acquisitions [GRAPPA] r\u2005=\u20052). Note that the structural MR images acquired herein were used in a larger voxel-based morphometry analysis to examine structural brain alterations in chronic visceral pain conditions [for details, see \u00d6hlmann   et al.  ]. Functional images for the assessment of BOLD responses were acquired with a single-shot echo-planar imaging [EPI] sequence [TR 2300 ms, TE 28.0 ms, flip angle 90\u00b0, FOV 220\u2005\u00d7\u2005220 mm , matrix 94\u2005\u00d7\u200594 mm , GRAPPA r\u2005=\u20052 with 38 transversal slices angulated in the direction of the corpus callosum, slice thickness of 3 mm, slice gap 0.6 mm, voxel size 2.3\u2005\u00d7\u20052.3\u2005\u00d7\u20053.0 mm ]. The images were preprocessed and analysed with SPM12 [Wellcome Center for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, London, UK] implemented in Matlab R2021b [MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA]. \n\nIn preparation for the co-registration and normalisation of functional images, the CAT12 toolbox [Computational Anatomy Toolbox, Structural Brain Mapping group, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany] implemented in SPM12 was used for spatial registration to the Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] template and segmentation into grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. Then, functional images were co-registered to the skull-stripped individual T1-weighted image, normalised to MNI space using a standardised template implemented in SPM12, and spatially smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 6 mm. The standard motion correction and realignment procedure implemented in SPM12 was applied to the functional images, resulting in the estimation of six realignment parameters describing the rigid body transformation between each image and the mean image used as a reference image. A temporal high-pass filter of 128 s was used to correct for low frequency drifts in the data. Serial autocorrelations were accounted for by means of an autoregressive model first-order correction. \n\nFor statistical first-level analyses, a General Linear Model [GLM] was applied to each subject\u2019s EPI images with regressors modelled based on a box car convolved with a canonical haemodynamic response function. For the first-level GLM [ie, computation of individual changes in BOLD responses], two regressors of interest were entered, ie, one for visceral stimulation [PAIN ] and one for somatic stimulation [PAIN ]. As regressors of no interest, presentations of the fixation cross prior to pain onset and ratings were included with the respective onsets and durations [see Section 2.3] and OFF phases were modelled as a stick function. Finally, realignment parameters were included as nuisance regressors for motor correction. To analyse BOLD responses to visceral compared tosomatic painful stimulation [ie, differential neural responses], the first-level contrasts PAIN \u2005>\u2005PAIN  and PAIN \u2005<\u2005PAIN  were computed and entered into second-level [ie, group-level differences in BOLD responses] analyses. One-sample t-tests were used to assess modality-specific effects within each group. Using small volume correction, these analyses were performed in a priori defined regions of interest [ROI], including the anterior and posterior insula, subregions of cingulate cortex [anterior cingulate cortex, midcingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex], thalamus, pre- and postcentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, basal ganglia [putamen, pallidum, caudate nucleus], amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal regions. All of these regions have previously been shown to be involved in the central processing and modulation of visceral pain,  with most regions being also involved in somatic pain processing.  The unilateral anatomical templates used for the ROI-analyses were derived from the WFU Pick Atlas toolbox Version 2.5.2,  which incorporates the automatic anatomical labelling [AAL] atlas. Segmentation of the insula [anterior, posterior] was based on previous literature.  For all analyses, significant results are reported corrected for multiple comparisons (using family-wise error [FWE] of alpha, set at   p  \u2005<0.05). All coordinates refer to MNI space, and plots were prepared using the software MRIcroGL [version 1.2.20210317]. \n\n\n### 2.6. Statistical analyses of behavioural data \n  \nData were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics 27 [IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY]. Group comparisons of questionnaire data as well as of pain thresholds were accomplished using independent samples t-tests. For mean perceived pain intensity, a mixed analysis of variance [ANOVA] was computed with group [UC/HC/IBS] as between-subjects factor and modality [visceral/somatic] as within-subjects factor, using paired t-tests for post-hoc testing. Exploratory correlational analyses between behavioural pain-related measures and clinical variables [ie, GI symptoms, pain severity, anxiety, depression, and chronic stress] were accomplished using Pearson\u2019s r. All data are reported as mean\u2005\u00b1\u2005standard deviation [SD], unless indicated otherwise, and plots were prepared with the ggplot2 package  using R [Version 4.1.1; R Core Team, Vienna, Austria] in RStudio [Version 2021.09.0\u2005+\u2005351; RStudio, Boston, MA]. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological characteristics \n  \nSample characteristics for UC [  N  \u2005=\u200520] and IBS [  N  \u2005=\u200523] patients and for healthy controls [  N  \u2005=\u200525] are summarised in  . In line with the recruitment strategy, symptom-based CAI of 0.60 [SD\u2005=\u20050.82; range: 0\u20133] and a mean faecal calprotectin concentration of 37.23 \u03bcg/g [SD\u2005=\u200523.33; range: 7.99\u2013105.30] confirmed clinical and biomarker remission in UC patients. Colitis-related medications as prescribed by the treating physician included aminosalicylates [N\u2005=\u200511], local corticosteroids [N\u2005=\u20051], TNF-\u03b1 blocker [N\u2005=\u20052], and azathioprine [  N  \u2005=\u20052]. The IBS cohort presented with different bowel habit disturbances [  N  \u2005=\u20059 diarrhoea-predominant,   N\u2005  =\u20054 constipation-predominant,   N  \u2005=\u20059 mixed, and   N  \u2005=\u20051 unspecified]. IBS-related medications included selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [  N  \u2005=\u20051], muscarine receptor antagonists [  N  \u2005=\u20052], and loop diuretics [  N  \u2005=\u20051]. Numbers of women reporting vaginal deliveries [\u22651] were as follows: UC [  N\u2005  =\u20057], IBS [  N  \u2005=\u20055], HC [  N  \u2005=\u20052], with perineal tears [UC:   N  \u2005=\u20052; IBS:   N  \u2005=\u20052; HC:   N  \u2005=\u20050] or episiotomy [UC:   N  \u2005=\u20052; IBS:   N  \u2005=\u20050; HC:   N  \u2005=\u20050]. Note that as per exclusion criteria, digital rectal examination revealed no abnormalities in any participant and no participant reported fecal incontinence. Reported disease duration was comparable in the UC and IBS cohorts [UC: 2\u201328 years; IBS: 1\u201326 years]. \n  \nClinical and psychological characteristics \n    \nAs expected, groups differed significantly in the amount of GI symptoms and pain severity, with UC patients reporting more symptoms and more severe pain than healthy volunteers but less symptoms than patients with IBS. Regarding psychological characteristics, compared with healthy volunteers, UC patients reported higher levels of anxiety and chronic stress, whereas there was no significant difference in symptoms of depression. Compared with IBS patients, both anxiety and depression symptoms were significantly lower in UC patients. Levels of chronic stress were comparable in both patient groups. \n\n\n### 3.2. Pain sensitivity in visceral and somatic modality \n  \nNo significant group differences in pain thresholds were observed for the visceral [HC: 40.20\u2005\u00b1\u200512.12 mmHg; UC: 34.00\u2005\u00b1\u200510.46 mmHg; IBS: 37.83\u2005\u00b1\u200510.09 mmHg] or the somatic modality [ ; HC: 45.17\u2005\u00b1\u20052.33\u00b0C; UC: 45.93\u2005\u00b1\u20052.39\u00b0C; IBS: 44.18\u2005\u00b1\u20053.83\u00b0C]. However, a trend for lower visceral pain thresholds was observable in patients with UC compared with healthy volunteers (t[43]\u2005=\u20051.81,   p  \u2005=\u20050.077). Visceral and somatic pain thresholds were not intercorrelated in any group. Correlational analyses in patients with UC revealed negative correlations between visceral pain thresholds and GI symptoms [r\u2005=\u2005-.47,   p  \u2005=\u20050.037] and with levels of perceived chronic stress [r\u2005=\u2005-.48,   p  \u2005=\u20050.033], respectively [ ], whereas no significant correlations were found for somatic pain thresholds. In contrast, in both control groups [ie, IBS patients and healthy volunteers] there were no significant correlations of visceral and somatic pain thresholds with clinical and psychological characteristics. \n  \n[A] Visceral and somatic pain thresholds.

Perceived pain intensity in visceral and somatic modality \n  \nWith regard to perceived pain intensity, the mixed ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between group and modality (F[2,65]\u2005=\u20054.634,   p  \u2005=\u20050.013, \u03b7  = .13). Post-hoc paired t-tests demonstrated a significant difference between mean visceral and somatic perceived pain intensities for healthy volunteers (t[24]\u2005=\u20052.14,   p  \u2005=\u20050.042, d\u2005=\u20050.43) and patients with IBS (t[22]\u2005=\u20052.42,   p  \u2005=\u20050.024, d\u2005=\u20050.51). Both control groups reported visceral pain intensity [HC: 67.37\u2005\u00b1\u200513.55 mm; IBS: 62.87\u2005\u00b1\u200516.59 mm] to be higher than somatic pain intensity [ ; HC: 63.18\u2005\u00b1\u200512.34 mm; IBS: 54.38\u2005\u00b1\u200518.13 mm]. In contrast, for patients with UC there was no significant difference between visceral [61.32\u2005\u00b1\u200515.85 mm] and somatic [66.36\u2005\u00b1\u200514.03 mm] perceived pain intensities (t[19]\u2005=\u2005-1.31,   p  \u2005=\u20050.208;  ). Correlational analyses revealed no significant associations of visceral or somatic perceived pain intensities with clinical and psychological characteristics within either UC patients or healthy controls. In patients with IBS, visceral perceived pain intensity positively correlated with anxiety symptoms [r\u2005=\u20050.55,   p  \u2005=\u20050.007] and chronic stress [r\u2005=\u20050.44,   p  \u2005=\u20050.037]. Higher somatic perceived pain intensity was also associated with higher levels of anxiety symptoms in IBS [r\u2005=\u20050.49,   p  \u2005=\u20050.017]. \n  \nVisceral and somatic perceived pain intensities are depicted averaged across trials. Error bars depict standard error. Statistical labelling corresponds to results of post-hoc paired t-tests comparing mean visceral and somatic perceived pain intensities within each group [*  p  \u2005<0.05].

Neural processing of visceral and somatic pain \n  \nResults regarding the neural processing of visceral and somatic pain are summarised in   and  , and a visualisation is provided in  . Briefly, enhanced differential neural responses to visceral compared to somatic pain [PAIN  > PAIN ] were observed in healthy volunteers, mainly in subregions of the insula and cingulum as well as sensory-motor related regions including the postcentral gyrus, thalamus, and supplementary motor area. Comparable response patterns involving several of these regions were seen in patients with IBS, whereas no significant differential neural responses in any ROI were found for this contrast in patients with UC [ ]. Conversely, UC patients showed enhanced differential responses to somatic compared with visceral pain [ie, in the reverse contrast PAIN  < PAIN ], involving the amygdala, hippocampus, subregions of the insula and cingulum, as well as sensory-motor related regions such as the postcentral gyrus, thalamus, and supplementary motor area [ ]. Enhanced differential responses to somatic compared with visceral pain stimuli were further observed in the hippocampus, posterior insula, and frontal regions in healthy volunteers, and altered involvement of the posterior insula, pre- and postcentral gyri was detectable in IBS patients [ ]. \n  \nDifferential neural responses to PAIN \u2005>\u2005PAIN \n      \nDifferential neural responses to PAIN \u2005<\u2005PAIN \n      \nDifferential functional brain responses to visceral and somatic stimuli.

Discussion \n  \nAlthough recurring symptoms of pain [especially yet not exclusively] arising from the viscera shape the clinical reality of patients with IBS and IBD alike, mechanisms relevant to pain experience and reporting remain incompletely understood, particularly in IBD. The present experimental study tested pain sensitivity for two pain modalities and employed a multiple-threat paradigm with visceral and somatic pain stimuli for the first time in patients, assessing pain responses at the behavioural and neural levels in women with UC in remission, compared to women with IBS as a patient control group, and healthy women. Regarding pain sensitivity, no significant group differences in pain thresholds emerged for either pain modality, although a trend was observed for lower visceral pain thresholds in UC patients. Further, lower visceral pain thresholds correlated with greater levels of self-reported GI symptoms and chronic stress in women with UC, suggesting that there may exist subgroup[s] of patients at risk for visceral hypersensitivity in phases of clinical remission, expanding on earlier findings supporting visceral hypersensitivity during active disease  or in IBD with persistent symptoms during remission, ie, during inactive disease.  The association between visceral sensitivity and chronic stress is novel and intriguing, as it adds to existing knowledge on the broad role of stress in shaping GI symptoms along the gut-brain axis in both acute and chronic visceral pain,  including IBD.  Longitudinal studies identified chronic stress and stress-related psychological symptoms as risk factors for disease exacerbation.  Given that the stress mediator cortisol specifically reduced visceral but not somatic pain thresholds in healthy volunteers, especially in women,  the present findings indicate that increased visceral pain sensitivity may be related to stress in UC in full remission, calling for larger studies to further elucidate mechanisms relevant to interindividual variability in persisting hyperalgesia beyond the resolution of acute inflammation in UC, as these may contribute to altered symptom perception and reporting. \n\nAlbeit pain sensitivity, as assessed by thresholding procedures, provides a clinically relevant marker in chronic pain conditions, it does not fully capture the multiple facets relevant to the experience of recurring pain as a salient and complex biopsychosocial threat. The present study is the first to employ an experimental paradigm modelling the experience of multiple aversive bodily threats from somatic and visceral pain modalities in patients with chronic visceral pain. For the UC cohort, our findings support distinct alterations in behavioural and neural measures of pain processing when compared with both IBS patients and healthy control groups. Specifically, upon experience of repeated acute pain stimuli from two modalities, control groups revealed higher pain reports and greater differential pain-induced neural activation in insular, cingulate, and somatosensory cortices in response to visceral pain stimuli, despite initial matching of stimulation intensities to perceived pain intensity. These corresponding findings at behavioural and neural levels corroborate earlier results supporting modality-specific responses for the visceral pain modality, thus far exclusively gathered in healthy samples.  Together, these results indicate prioritised visceral over somatic pain processing, consistent with the notion of a greater biological salience of visceral pain. In contrast to both comparison groups, women with UC failed to show a similar pattern of responses, ie, lacked prioritisation of the visceral modality, indicating that visceral and somatic pain constituted equally salient threats. When interpreting this disease-specific finding and its possible clinical implications, it is important to consider that a prioritisation of visceral over somatic pain is likely an evolutionary-driven, adaptive response, which is fundamental to behavioural flexibility in the face of multiple threats.  In other words, adaptive responses, such as avoidance behaviour driven by fear of pain, are normally selectively scaled and dynamically changed based on the degree or imminence of danger.  Our results in UC could indicate a maladaptive lack of behavioural flexibility in the face of pain from multiple bodily sites. This is consistent with the fact that the experience of clinical pain symptoms in IBD is not confined to the GI tract, but commonly also arises from the musculoskeletal system or the joints as part of extraintestinal disease manifestations which are related to disease activity.  Hence, based on previous symptom experience and learning, somatic pain may comprise a higher threat value and greater salience in IBD than in IBS, where visceral pain is the defining symptom. Although speculative, this could imply that in IBD, the experience of somatic pain contributes to stress and worry, negatively impacting on coping strategies and quality of life. In turn, the experience of multiple symptoms could enhance patients\u2019 vulnerability to being caught in the vicious feedback cycle of symptom perception, fear and stress responses, hypervigilance, and sensitisation, ultimately increasing relapse risk.  Psychological factors such as chronic stress, depression, or anxiety symptoms, which constitute key components of this feedback cycle and demonstrably modulate the evaluation and central processing of pain in health and other chronic pain conditions including IBS,  could also play a role herein. Given low depression scores in this UC cohort, it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the possible role of depression or other psychiatric comorbidities. The observed associations between psychological variables and pain intensity reporting in IBS may indicate a disease-specific impact of psychological factors which should be addressed in future studies in a patient cohort with a broader range of psychological symptoms. Importantly, the most obvious distinction between IBD and IBS pathophysiology is chronic inflammation, which may explain disease-specific alterations observed herein. Effects of acute peripheral inflammation on brain and behaviour are well documented, as illustrated by a wealth of research into sickness behaviour [such as mood disturbances, anhedonia, fatigue, mild cognitive impairment] with hyperalgesia as a key symptom.  Besides acute or short-term effects, which are likely less important to UC in full remission, there exist data supporting long-lasting effects of repeated intestinal inflammatory insults. Such long-term effects may persist beyond\u2014or even emerge after\u2014the resolution of acute inflammation, as suggested by our recent work supporting effects on visceral pain-related fear memory processing induced by pain-related conditioning during endotoxaemia [an experimentally-induced inflammatory state].  In animal models of colitis, behavioural responses associated with abdominal discomfort and anxiety-related behaviours have been documented in rats 50 days after repeated inflammatory challenges.  Changes in afferent sensory pathways and the central nervous system [CNS] have also been documented after the resolution of intestinal inflammation, including persistent central inflammation,  and widespread changes in the neural response to acute experimental visceral pain including thalamocortical sensitisation.  In patients with IBD in remission, functional brain imaging studies support altered task-related brain responses in the processing of emotional stimuli, ie, decreased sensitivity to positive emotions,  in the context of stress,  and during the anticipation of pain.  Our data complement and expand on this work by indicating alterations in the processing of acute pain from multiple modalities, together extending existing knowledge about CNS alterations in IBD thus far mainly focused on altered brain structure [eg, ] and resting state functional connectivity [eg, ]. \n\nOur results should be interpreted in light of several limitations. Our UC patient cohort exclusively comprised women who were in full clinical remission. Hence, our findings may not generalise to male UC patients nor to patients with active disease. We included IBS as a patient control group with similar GI symptoms yet no history of overt intestinal inflammation, allowing indirect deductions regarding the putative role of inflammation. However, we had no endoscopic or histological data and did not measure additional inflammatory markers beyond faecal calprotectin. Low-grade inflammation, as it is detectable in IBD during clinical remission, eg, based on analyses of cytokine concentrations in plasma,  and has also been discussed to play a role in IBS  could not be evaluated. Given several possible immune-mediated mechanisms for the persistence of GI symptoms and hyperalgesia along the gut-brain axis, including increased mucosal barrier permeability, reduced bacterial diversity, proinflammatory microbiome, or ongoing subclinical mucosal inflammation,  future studies should ideally combine peripheral and central measures relevant to visceral pain, as recently accomplished in IBS.  Clearly, both IBD and IBS are complex and heterogeneous clinical conditions involving the gut-brain axis. Albeit a challenging endeavour, the comparison of two patient cohorts with similar pain-related phenotypes yet distinct pathophysiology holds much promise, as illustrated by work on alterations in central pain processing in other chronic inflammatory conditions unrelated to the gut-brain axis.  Therefore, future studies are needed to further clarify distinct and common pain mechanisms, ideally in larger samples that would also be more conducive to correlational or subgroup analyses addressing the putative role of disease characteristics, including disease extent and durations, or medications. Our first attempt to highlight possible disease-specific alterations in pain processing can contribute to the ongoing debate on overlap and differences of IBD and IBS.  Beyond a better knowledge about the gut-brain axis in patients, such research also has implications for treatment. Although a variety of evidence-based psychological interventions is available for IBS,  treatment of IBD is still mainly focused on the induction of remission in patients with active disease, and substantially less attention is given to improvement of persistent symptoms and quality of life during phases of disease remission.  Interventions proven to be effective in IBS are often adopted for patients with IBD in remission. However, at least from the perspective of acute pain processing, IBD and IBS show distinct features, questioning this practice and calling for interventions specifically tailored to the needs of IBD patients in remission, considering extraintestinal manifestations including somatic pain. In fact, previous studies often provide mixed evidence regarding psychological interventions for IBD,  and different coping styles have been shown to be beneficial in patients with IBD versus patients with IBS.  A better understanding of the long-lasting effects of repeated inflammatory bouts on the processing of aversive bodily threats might provide new starting points for the development of interventions specifically designed for patients with IBD in remission suffering from persistent pain and related GI symptoms. With respect to experimental research approaches, including brain imaging studies, we modelled the experience of multiple threats arising from the viscera and other bodily sites. Prospectively, it is important to integrate these different lines of research by implementing paradigms to investigate emotional and cognitive aspects specifically in the context of acute pain in IBD. This will help to generate a comprehensive understanding of the subjective experience of pain in IBD, broadening the hitherto existing focus on pain sensitivity, and further knowledge about the complex gut-brain axis at the interface of neurogastroenterology, psychological pain research, and the neurosciences. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10637045, "text_md5": "d2938300c0a801760315387d1cc3119e", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 144], "journal": [145, 161], "publication_year": [163, 167], "title": [178, 334], "keywords": [348, 416], "abstract": [429, 2408], "body": [2417, 43557]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 37161902, "doi": "10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjad080", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10637045", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10637045"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10637045\">10637045</a>", "list_title": "PMC10637045  Distinct Alterations in Central Pain Processing of Visceral and Somatic Pain in Quiescent Ulcerative Colitis Compared to Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Health"}

The effects of giving magnitude, target, and audience on the neural signature of giving in adolescence\u2606\n\n# Keywords\n\nGiving\nAdolescence\nTarget\nAudience\nFMRI\nProsocial behavior\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nGiving is essential for forming and maintaining social relationships, which is an important developmental task for adolescents. This pre-registered fMRI study investigated behavioral and neural correlates of adolescents\u2019 (  N  \u00a0=\u00a0128, ages 9 \u2013 19 years) small versus large size giving in different social contexts related to target (i.e., giving to a friend or unfamiliar peer) and peer presence (i.e., anonymous versus audience giving). Participants gave more in the small size than large size condition, more to friends than to unfamiliar peers, and more in the audience compared to anonymous condition. Giving very small or large amounts was associated with increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior insula (AI), and older adolescents showed increased lateral and anterior PFC activation for small size giving. We observed activity in the intraparietal cortex (IPL), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and AI for giving to friends, but no age-related differences in this activity. Behaviorally, in contrast, we observed that older adolescents differentiated more in giving between friends and unfamiliar peers. Finally, we observed interactions between peer presence and target in the AI, and between giving magnitude and target in the precuneus. Together, findings reveal higher context-dependency of giving and more lateral PFC activity for small versus large giving in older adolescents. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAdolescence is the period between approximately ages 8\u201322-years during which individuals develop mature personal and social goals, that fit the increasingly complex social world they are to navigate ( ). A key developmental challenge in this period is to cultivate kind and reciprocal relationships with others, with giving as one of the most important building blocks for such relationships ( ,  ,  ). Prior developmental studies examined giving behavior towards unfamiliar others using the Dictator Game paradigm, in which an individual can give away valuable resources (e.g., coins or money; ( ). These studies, that examined non-strategic costly giving, showed no behavioral differences between children, adolescents, and adults ( ,  ,  ). Developmental differences were, however, observed in studies that utilized strategic interaction paradigms (i.e., games where giving behaviors can improve one\u2019s own situation via reciprocity, reputation, or public good, such as the Ultimatum Game;  ). Such studies in 6\u201313-year old children ( ) and 9\u201318-year-old adolescents ( ) showed that individuals give more to unfamiliar others with increasing age. Together, these studies suggest that adolescence is characterized by age-related increases in strategic motivations behind giving ( ). \n\nRecent evidence shows that social contextual factors also influence decision-making in adolescence. Three social contextual factors that may influence giving behavior in adolescence are giving magnitude (i.e., relative costs and benefits for self and others), the target of giving, and peer presence. First, giving has traditionally been studied using unrestricted Dictator Games, in which individuals were free to divide valuable resources as they see fit. Although most individuals make such decisions in line with equity norms, studies that restricted Dictator Games by making them either equitable or inequitable have shown that individuals also often make inequity decisions, for example when they worry about costs for the self or do not want to receive less than others ( ). Giving behavior and the underlying neural mechanisms also depended on whether such inequity was advantageous or disadvantageous to the self, suggesting that the relative costliness of giving distributions impact giving behavior ( ). A second important factor relates to the target of giving. Adolescents have a fundamental social motivation for their friends compared to less familiar targets. This is evidenced by a recent study where adults accommodated friend outcomes mainly when this friend was present and could monitor decisions, whereas adolescents did so regardless of whether their friend was present ( ). This motivation is also apparent in developmental studies assessing giving behavior: with increasing age, adolescents give more to friends, but less to unfamiliar others ( ). The extent to which adolescents differentiate between giving to friends and unfamiliar others depends on their level of perspective-taking ( ), a process that develops during adolescence ( ). A third factor that influences decision-making is whether decisions are made in the presence of peers. It was previously observed that adolescents contribute more to common goods when this behavior is observed or liked by peers ( ), but this study did not examine developmental differences. Developmental studies revealed that adolescents are more susceptible to peer influence effects in a risk-taking task than adults ( ), although the mere presence of other adolescents does not always result in increased risk-taking ( ), suggesting that peer presence effects depend on the specific context ( ). \n\nThe influence of social contextual factors provides a novel perspective on giving in adolescence, but the mechanisms that drive potential developmental changes in giving magnitude, target, and audience effects are not yet well understood. Functional neuroimaging studies can address this by providing insight into the neural correlates of giving. A meta-analysis on strategic and altruistic giving in adults revealed various brain regions that are involved in giving to unfamiliar others, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior insula (AI), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC;  ). Developmental comparison studies demonstrated that adolescents showed stronger activation in the dlPFC and temporal parietal junction (TPJ) when rejecting unfair proposals by unfamiliar others in an Ultimatum Game ( ). Similar results were observed in a Trust Game, where a first player trusts a division of goods to a second player who can reciprocate. Reciprocating after receiving trust by an unfamiliar other was associated with stronger activation in dlPFC and TPJ with increasing age ( ). These findings suggest that with increasing age adolescents more strongly recruit brain regions implicated in strategic giving, specifically the dlPFC and TPJ ( ,  ,  ). \n\nRecently, researchers suggested that the neural patterns implicated in giving may reveal differential sensitivities to social contexts ( ). In a previous fMRI study with adult participants, we developed a new paradigm in which participants could give a small or large number of valuable coins to friends or unfamiliar peers ( ). Half of the trials were performed in an \u2018audience present\u2019 condition and the other half of the trials in an \u2018anonymous\u2019 condition. Consistent with the meta-analysis by  , activation in mPFC and AI was dependent on giving magnitude, with stronger activity for relatively generous decisions ( ). Such activation has been interpreted to reflect norm violation detection, or feelings of empathy and generosity ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Furthermore, giving to friends relative to unfamiliar peers was associated with stronger activation in the anterior intraparietal lobe (IPL)/TPJ, possibly indicating that participants took the mental states of others into account ( ,  ). Finally, being observed by an audience was associated with increased activity in the posterior IPL/TPJ ( ), consistent with a recent meta-analysis on audience effects ( ). Other studies in adults have additionally shown that ventral striatum activation is modulated by peer presence in the context of charitable donations. For example, one study observed especially high ventral striatum activation when participant were relatively generous with an audience present, or less generous in the absence of an audience ( ). \n\nTaken together, in adults partly separable and partly overlapping neural regions are involved in processing giving magnitude, giving to friends versus distant others, and in giving in the presence of an audience versus anonymously ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The current study used the aforementioned giving paradigm to test the effect of giving magnitude, target familiarity, and audience effects on giving behavior and associated neural activity in adolescence ( ). \n\nSo far, few studies in adolescents have examined whether neural patterns of giving differ depending on giving magnitude, the target, or the presence of an audience. Regarding giving magnitude, one study in 15\u201318-year-olds showed increased activation in the dACC, ventral midbrain, anterior insula, and cuneus for costly giving versus non-costly rewards ( ). Another study including 8\u201316-year-olds showed enhanced activation in the inferior temporal gyrus and precuneus for costly relative to non-costly giving ( ). With regard to the target, a prior study demonstrated that in adolescents, giving to friends compared to unfamiliar others was associated with stronger activation in the putamen, a subregion of the ventral striatum; the parietal cortex (overlapping or close to the TPJ), and the precentral gyrus (overlapping or close to dlPFC;  ), but this study did not include age comparisons. Second, in an iterated Trust Game paradigm, trusting a trustworthy versus untrustworthy unfamiliar other was associated with an age-related increase in activity in the precuneus/posterior cingulate, whereas the mPFC showed an age-related increase in responsiveness to interactions with an untrustworthy unfamiliar other ( ). Third, young adolescents with a history of social exclusion and rejection, compared to highly accepted adolescents, showed stronger activity in dlPFC and TPJ when giving generously in a modified Dictator Game to players who previously excluded them in a Cyberball Game ( ). Finally, a study that examined the effects of peer presence on neural activation in adolescents showed increased activation in the mPFC, TPJ, precuneus en STS ( ). \n\nTaken together, adolescents and adults recruit similar brain regions when giving in various social contexts, including the ventral striatum, AI, prefrontal cortex (medial and lateral) and social brain regions such as the IPL/TPJ. However, no prior study examined the age-related differences in neural activation throughout adolescence that is implicated in giving in these social contexts. Therefore, this study had three aims, which all address a contextual consideration of giving decisions. The first aim of this study was to examine the effect of giving magnitude on giving behavior and its neural correlates (small vs. large giving). The second aim was to test whether neural correlates of giving considerations were dependent on the target (i.e., a friend versus unfamiliar peer). The third aim was to examine whether giving behavior and neural activation differed as a function of peer presence (giving with an audience versus anonymously). Finally, an important overarching goal was to examine possible interactions with age for each of these three contextual considerations. \n\n### Aim & hypotheses of the current study \n  \nThe current study, including confirmatory hypotheses (outlined below) was pre-registered at the Open Science Framework:  . To examine adolescents\u2019 audience and anonymous giving to friends and unfamiliar peers and the associated neural correlates, we used the giving paradigm previously validated in adults ( ), in which adolescents divided either a small or large number of coins (giving magnitude manipulation) between themselves and either a friend or unfamiliar peer (target manipulation) in an audience or anonymous context (peer presence manipulation). This task is a modified version of the Dictator Game, which is an economic game traditionally used to study giving behavior ( ,  ). The task included two giving conditions, in which participants could give away either a relatively small (i.e., less than half of seven coins; low-costly) or large amount (i.e., more than half of seven coins; high-costly;  ). This approach ensured the inclusion of individuals who would show no or little giving under unrestricted giving conditions ( ,  ). Within these task conditions, participants could decide upon the number of coins to give away, which ensured voluntary choices ( ,  ), as autonomous decisions give the best indication of generosity ( ). As such, the current design allowed us to assess the neural comparison between small versus large size giving, even in individuals who show little variability in giving behavior, as well as the neural signature of generosity, by examining the neural activation associated with relative generosity within the small and large giving conditions. \n\n#### Confirmatory behavioral hypotheses \n  \n (  1) We expected that adolescents would give more to their friends than to unfamiliar peers (main effect target;  ;  ). We expected this effect to be strongest in the \u2018small amount\u2019 condition compared to the \u2018large amount\u2019 condition, because participants\u2019 personal loss is lowest in the small amount condition (target x giving condition interaction). (2) We expected that older adolescents would give more to their friends and less to unfamiliar peers, compared to younger adolescents (target x age interaction;  ). (3) We expected that participants would donate more in the audience compared to the anonymous condition (main effect peer presence;  ,  ). We explored possible age differences in this effect. (4) Pre-registered hypotheses regarding sex effects were not examined in this study. \n\n\n#### Confirmatory brain activation hypotheses \n  \nAs detailed in our pre-registration, we used both confirmatory ROI analyses and exploratory whole brain analyses to examine the neural activation related to giving in different contexts. The reason for including the exploratory whole brain analyses was to gain insight into neural patterns associated with the newly developed paradigm aside from the a-priori defined ROIs, which can inform hypotheses for future neuroimaging studies. Here, we focused on six pre-registered ROIs that were created using Neurosynth ( ; date February 17, 2020). We used this Neurosynth approach, on which more information can be found in the method section, to assure that our confirmatory ROI analyses were grounded in a synthesis of prior fMRI studies. The six ROIs, the mPFC, TPJ, AI, dACC, LPFC, and nAcc, were selected as earlier studies showed involvement of these regions in prosocial decision making, or because they related to more general constructs of mentalizing, decision making, and cognitive control (see  ). Our pre-registered expectations regarding neural activation are detailed below. (5) We expected that contrasting the small to large amount condition would result in activation in at least one of the following brain regions: the mPFC and the AI ( ). (6) We expected that contrasting the condition in which adolescents give to a friend to the condition in which adolescents give to an unfamiliar peer would result in activation in at least one of the following brain regions: the TPJ and ventral striatum ( ,  ). (7) We expected that being observed in the audience condition would result in increased activity in brain regions that are part of the social brain network, including the TPJ ( ). (8) No hypotheses were pre-registered about age-related differences in neural activation. However, based on prior literature showing increased dlPFC and TPJ activation with increasing age for fair decisions, we expected increased activation with increasing age in these regions for relatively generous decisions ( ,  ). Furthermore, based on prior literature we expected age-related increases in activation for giving to a friend versus unfamiliar peer in the dlPFC and TPJ ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Sample and participant selection \n  \nIn total, 142 adolescents participated in this cross-sectional study, which is the first measurement wave of a three-wave longitudinal project on the development of prosocial behavior in adolescence called \u2018Brainlinks\u2019. Participants were excluded from further analysis when they did not perform or finish the fMRI task (  N  \u00a0=\u00a02) or showed head movement (\u2265 3\u00a0mm) during the fMRI task (  N  \u00a0=\u00a011). The final sample consisted of 128 adolescents (81 females), between the ages of 9 \u2013 19 (  M   = 14.78,   SD   = 2.65; age range 9.00 \u2013 18.89 years). Participants were recruited through local and online advertisements and provided written informed consent. For minors (i.e., ages 15 and younger), both parents also provided written informed consent. Participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and no diagnosed intellectual disability (IQ < 70). Participants were screened by means of a checklist for neurological or psychiatric disorders and MRI contraindications via a private telephone conversation. The local medical ethical committee approved the study. Participants received \u20ac20 (ages < 12 years) or \u20ac30 (ages \u2265 12 years) and small presents for their participation, plus additional earnings from the fMRI task and other tasks that were performed as part of the larger study protocol. \n\n\n### Materials: fMRI giving task \n  \n#### Giving magnitude: giving small and large amounts \n  \nTo assess the neural correlates of giving behavior, we used a modified fMRI version of the Dictator Game previously validated in adults ( ,  ). Participants divided 7 coins between themselves and another person - who could not reject the decision - in either a small or large giving condition. Giving was operationalized as the number of given coins. In the small giving condition, participants could give away 1, 2, or 3 out of 7 coins. In the large giving condition, participants could give away 4, 5, or 6 out of 7 coins. Participants could not give 0 coins, 7 coins, or make an equal split to warrant comparability between the small and large giving condition (see  ).   \n(A) The small and large giving conditions of the task, in which participants could give away 1, 2, or 3 coins, or 4, 5, or 6 coins, respectively (depicted in orange). Participants would keep the remainder of the 7 coins (depicted in yellow) to themselves. The name of the target (which could either be a friend or unfamiliar peer) was displayed at the top of the screen for each trial. (B) In two out of four blocks of the giving task, participants made anonymous giving choices. In the other two blocks, participants were aware that the peer audience depicted on the screen would observe their choices later in time (i.e., the audience condition). Note that the screens indicating whether blocks were audience or anonymous were only displayed at the start of each block, not during trials. Audience and anonymous blocks were presented in counterbalanced order. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n#### Familiarity of the target: friend and unfamiliar peer \n  \nThe target of giving was either the participant\u2019s closest friend (same-sex, similar-age) or an unfamiliar peer (same-sex, similar-age, anonymized participant of the same study). For each trial, the name of the target was displayed at the top of the screen (see  ). Participants were instructed that the coins they divided in each trial were worth actual money (i.e., 20 eurocents each) and that the computer would randomly select a few trials of the task to determine the payout of the participant, friend, and unfamiliar other. Accordingly, participants received a payment for themselves (  M   = \u20ac.80,   SD   = \u20ac.12) and their friend (  M   = \u20ac.68,   SD   = \u20ac.08), and experimenters transferred the payment to the unfamiliar other (i.e., another participant of the current study;   M   = \u20ac.61,   SD   = \u20ac.09). \n\n\n#### Peer presence: anonymous and audience giving \n  \nTo assess the effects of peer presence on giving, the task consisted of two blocks in which participants made anonymous choices, and two blocks in which participants\u2019 choices were evaluated by peers later in time (see  ). The order of anonymous and audience blocks was counterbalanced across participants. In a practice session prior to the MRI session, participants viewed a video clip of six peers (three males and three females, aged 9\u201319) with neutral expressions. To the awareness of participants, these six peers were invited after study completion to observe and evaluate choices of participants. Trials in the anonymous blocks were not shown to anyone, as \u2013 beknown to participants - experimenters covered the screen in the control room. \n\n\n#### Task duration and stimuli \n  \nThe task was presented in the MRI scanner via E-prime version 2 ( ). Each block began with a screen showing, for 4000-milliseconds, whether it was an anonymous or audience block. These screens were displayed at the start of each block, and not during trials, to avoid differences in visual complexity and thus neural activation between audience and anonymous trials. Within a block, each trial started with a jittered fixation cross for 0 \u2013 4400\u2009ms (  M   = 550\u2009ms) which was optimized using OptSeq ( ). Hereafter, three possible giving options were shown (i.e., giving 1, 2, or 3 coins in the small giving condition, and 4, 5, or 6 coins in the large giving condition). Participants had to choose within 2000\u2009ms how many coins to give by pressing a response button with their right index-, middle-, or ring finger. Choices were confirmed for 1000\u2009ms via a white frame around the selected choice. In case participants did not press in time, a \u2018too late\u2019 screen was shown for 1000\u2009ms and these trials were excluded from analysis. \n\n\n#### Order of blocks and trials \n  \nThe task consisted of four blocks with 40 trials per block, resulting in 160 trials in total. All combinations of conditions (giving magnitude, target, and peer presence) were equally distributed across trials. The order of trials was optimized using OptSeq ( ). There was a short break between the second and third block of the task (i.e., in between runs). The total length of the task, excluding instructions and pauses, was approximately 15\u2009min. Before scanning, participants performed a practice version of the task consisting of four trials per condition in randomized order. \n\n\n#### Manipulation check \n  \nTo check whether participants differentiated between targets, they rated how important the friend and unfamiliar peer were to them and how much they liked them on a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). \n\n\n#### Giving behavior \n  \nWe measured participants\u2019 giving behavior with a button response box, where pressing the left button was coded as 1, the middle as 2, and the right as 3. To enable a comparison of relative generosity in the small and large giving conditions, scores were transformed to percentages. As such, the lowest number of coins given (1 and 4) were recoded as 33.33%, the middle number of coins given (2 and 5) as 66.66%, and the highest number of coins given (3 and 6) as 100%. As detailed in our pre-registration, we used these scores to examine average giving behavior and whether giving varied as a function of task conditions. We also examined whether there were reaction time differences between conditions. Furthermore, we examined age effects (i.e., linear and quadratic) on giving. \n\nNote that a Bonferroni correction was applied to the behavioral analyses to account for multiple testing, resulting in a corrected alpha of\u00a0.01 (  p  \u2009=\u2009.05 divided by 5 behavioral analyses is   p  \u2009=\u2009.01). While most results were significant after this correction, some were not. For these analyses, we report that they are significant at an uncorrected threshold. \n\n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nAfter expressing interest in the study, participants received information by telephone and a digital information letter. After agreeing to take part, participants filled out two questionnaires prior to their laboratory visit, which included self-report measures on prosocial behaviors and personality. During their visit, participants first received instructions about the visit, MRI scanner, and measurements. The MRI session consisted of a functional scan, structural scan, two fMRI tasks, and a diffusion tensor imaging scan. Finally, participants filled out questionnaires and performed tasks outside the MRI scanner. \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nWe acquired MRI scans using a 3T MRI scanner (Philips Achieva TX, Erlangen, Germany) with a standard whole-head coil. Stimuli were shown using a screen, which participants could see through a mirror attached to the head coil. Functional scans were acquired during two runs, which consisted of 178 and 205 dynamic scans, respectively. We collected T2*\u2009weighted gradient echo planar images (EPI) (TR = 2.2\u2009s, TE = 30\u2009ms, flip angle 8\u00b0, sequential acquisition: 38 slices, voxel size = 2.75\u2009\u00d72.75\u2009\u00d72.75\u2009mm, 80\u2009\u00d780 matrix, field of view [FOV] = 220\u2009\u00d7 220\u2009\u00d7 115\u2009mm). Before the start of each functional run, 5 dummy scans were acquired. For anatomical reference, a high-resolution 3D T1-weighted anatomical image was collected prior to the functional scans (TR = 7.9\u2009ms, TE = 3.5\u2009ms, flip angle 8\u00b0, 3D matrix size for 3D acquisitions: 228\u2009\u00d7177 x 155 slices, axial slice orientation, voxel size: 1.1\u2009\u00d71.1\u2009\u00d71.1\u2009mm, FOV = 250\u2009\u00d7196 x 170\u2009mm). T1 stabilization dummy scans were automatically discarded by the scanner. This scan\u2019s length was 4\u2009min and 12\u2009s. All scans were acquired using a fast field echo pulse sequence. To avoid head motion, participants\u2019 head motion was limited with foam inserts at both sides of the head when possible. Before exclusion of participants who showed excessive head motion, movement was as follows: movement range:\u00a0.00 \u2013 11.30\u2009mm,   M   =\u20090.10,   SD   =\u20090.12. Movement for the final sample was as follows:\u00a0.00 \u2013 2.97\u2009mm,   M   =\u20090.08,   SD   =\u20090.08. \n\n\n### MRI data analysis \n  \n#### Preprocessing \n  \nMRI data analysis was performed using SPM8 (Welcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, United Kingdom). Functional images were preprocessed using the following steps: realignment, slice-time correction, spatial normalization using segmentation parameters, and spatial smoothing with a 6-mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel. The normalization algorithm used a 12-parameter affine transform with a nonlinear transformation involving cosine basis functions and resampled the volumes to 3-mm cubic voxels. Templates were based on MNI-305 stereotaxic space. All functional scans were corrected for excessive head motion using 6 parameters. \n\n\n#### General linear model \n  \nTo perform first-level individual analyses, we used the general linear model in SPM8. The fMRI time series were modeled as a series of zero duration events time-locked to stimulus onset and convolved with the hemodynamic response function (HRF). Note that a reaction times model showed highly similar results. We used the modelled events (i.e., giving magnitude condition: small vs. large; target: friend vs. unfamiliar peer; peer presence: audience vs anonymous giving) as regressors in a general linear model, alongside a basic set of cosine functions that high-pass filtered the data (cutoff: 120\u2009s). The start screens, in which the type of block (anonymous or audience present) was indicated, were modelled separately. In addition, we included six motion parameters as nuisance regressors. Trials on which participants did not respond were modelled separately as covariate of no interest and were excluded from analyses. We used the least-square parameter estimates of the height of the best-fitting canonical hemodynamic response function for each condition in pair-wise contrasts. These pairwise comparisons led to subject-specific contrast images, which we submitted to second-level group analyses. We followed all analyses steps as detailed in our pre-registration on the Open Science Framework  , with three exceptions. First, we did not include B0 field maps, as inclusion was not compatible with our MRI analysis pipeline. Second, we did not use the scrubbing option. Instead of scrubbing, we excluded participants who moved more than 3\u2009mm during the functional scans. Although additional movement control procedures, such as scrubbing (i.e., accounting for volumes in which movement exceeds a certain threshold, as described by  ) are important to consider even after excluding participants with >\u20093\u2009mm movement, such decisions should be weighed against power loss by removing data. Therefore, this study strictly excluded participants based on movement (>3\u2009mm), and added motion parameters to the design, but did not use additional scrubbing as power in each cell would be significantly reduced by data loss. Full information on movement parameters in the current sample is presented in  . Third, we extracted the NAcc ROIs from the Harvard-Oxford subcortical atlas instead of the AAL atlas as described in the pre-registration as the AAL atlas only includes ROIs of the whole caudate and not the NAcc specifically. \n\n\n#### Confirmatory ROI analyses \n  \nTo test for neural differences related to giving condition and target, we created 6 ROIs using the MarsBaR toolbox ( ; http://MarsBaR.sourceforge.net/) for SPM8 for which we extracted parameter estimates. We defined our ROIs (i.e., the mPFC, TPJ, AI, dACC, LPFC, and nAcc) using Neurosynth (http://neurosynth.org/; date February 17, 2020). The center of mass for each of the ROIs was extracted from Neurosynth meta-analyses using target words: \u201cmentalizing\u201d for the mPFC and bilateral TPJ, \u201cdecision making\u201d for the AI and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and \u201ccognitive control\u201d for the LPFC) Consecutively, we used MarsBaR to build 10\u2009mm spheres around the center of mass extracted for each ROI. NAcc ROIs were extracted from the Harvard-Oxford subcortical atlas with a threshold of 40%. The left nAcc consisted of 28 voxels [ x\u2009=\u2009\u22129.57, y\u2009=\u200911.70, z\u2009=\u2009\u22127.10] and the right nAcc consisted of 26 voxels [ x\u2009=\u20099.45, y\u2009=\u200912.60, z\u2009=\u2009\u22126.69]. An image with all ROIs was uploaded to NeuroVault ( ), see \u2018Other\u2019 maps on  . For each of the ROIs, we tested for main effects and interactions of task-conditions, using 2x2x2 (i.e., giving condition x target x peer presence) repeated measures ANOVAs. Given the focus on six ROIs, a Bonferroni corrected alpha of\u00a0.008 was used to account for multiple testing. That is, we used a   p   value of.05 divided by the number of ROIs:\u00a0.05/6\u2009=\u20090.008. To examine age effects, linear age and quadratic age were added to the repeated measures ANOVAs in a stepwise manner. \n\n\n#### Whole brain analysis examining task conditions \n  \nWe performed a 2 (giving condition: small or large) x 2 (target: friend or unfamiliar peer) x2 (peer presence: audience vs anonymous giving) ANOVA to explore neural responses across the whole brain at the group level. We examined the following whole-brain contrasts: \u2018small giving condition versus large giving condition\u2019, \u2018friend versus unfamiliar peer\u2019, and \u2018audience versus anonymous giving\u2019, as well as the reverse contrasts, and tested for possible interaction effects between conditions. Task-related responses were considered significant when they surpassed false discovery rate (FDR) cluster correction of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05, with an initial uncorrected threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 ( ). All reported whole brain analyses are available on NeuroVault, see group maps on  . \n\n\n#### Exploratory age-related whole brain analysis \n  \nTo explore age effects that were not related to the predefined ROIs, linear age and quadratic age were added to the whole-brain contrasts. \n\n\n#### Exploratory generosity-related whole brain analysis \n  \nOur prior study in young adults that used the same experimental paradigm showed that relatively generous response options within the small and large giving condition (i.e., giving 2 or 3 coins, or 5 or 6 coins, as compared to 1 or 4 coins, respectively) resulted in increased activation in the mPFC and right AI. Therefore, although not specified in our pre-registration, we also examined minimal vs. generous giving and the reverse contrasts within the small (i.e., giving 1 vs 2/3 coins) and large (i.e., giving 4 vs. 5/6 coins) giving conditions. This analysis could only be performed for participants who showed every response option within the giving condition, resulting in 107 participants for the small giving condition and 86 participants for the large giving condition. To maximize the number of trials in this analysis, we collapsed across target and peer presence conditions. To examine age effects, linear age and quadratic age were added to the whole-brain contrasts. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe performed assumption checks for all analyses. For all behavioral variables and some neural variables, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests of normality were significant, indicating deviations from normality (i.e., absolute   z  -values > 3.29 and   p  \u2019s\u2009\u2264\u20090.05). However, as skewness values were all lower than 2, and square, square root, cube root, inverse, and log transformations did not improve normality, we report untransformed values for all analyses. No other violations of assumptions were observed. There were a few outliers as assessed by inspection of a boxplot (i.e., values greater than 3 box-lengths from the edge of the box), which were therefore winsorized ( ). Specifically, three participants were outliers on one variable each. We report the winsorized results, but the results were similar with and without winsorizing. For each of the repeated measures ANOVAs reported below, we tested all main and interaction effects. \n\n### Behavioral results \n  \n#### Manipulation checks \n  \nParticipants rated their friend as more important (  M   = 6.46,   SD   =0.83) than the unfamiliar peer (  M   = 3.37,   SD   = 1.47), as indicated by a paired-samples t-test,   t  (127)\u2009=\u200922.97,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001. Participants also liked their friend (  M =   6.63,   SD   =0.60) more than the unfamiliar peer (  M   = 4.06,   SD   =0.67),   t  (127)\u2009=\u200932.11,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001. Therefore, the manipulation checks confirmed that participants differentiated between friends and unfamiliar peers regarding importance and liking. \n\n\n#### Giving behavior \n  \nTo examine the effects of task conditions on giving behavior, we performed a repeated measures ANOVA with giving condition (small vs. large), target (friend vs. unfamiliar peer), and peer presence (audience vs. anonymous giving) as within-subject variables and giving (in percentages) as dependent variable. There was a main effect of giving condition,   F  (1, 127) =\u2009153.23,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.55, such that participants gave relatively more in the small (  M   = 71.39,   SD   = 17.47) compared to the large giving condition (  M   = 47.31,   SD   = 11.82). There was also a main effect of target,   F  (1, 127) =\u200999.97,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.44, and a two-way interaction between giving condition and target,   F  (1, 127) =\u200921.41,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.14. As shown in  , participants gave more to a friend (  M   = 64.61,   SD   = 11.24) than an unfamiliar peer (  M   = 54.09,   SD   = 12.13), but this difference was more pronounced in the small giving condition (  M   = 78.21,   SD   =   16.67  ; M   = 64.57  , SD   = 21.46) compared to the large giving condition (  M   =51.00,   SD   =   15.50  ; M   = 43.61  , SD   = 10.55).   \n(A) Mean percentage of coins given to a friend and unfamiliar peer in the small and large giving conditions. (B) Mean percentage of coins given in the small and large giving condition, for each of the peer presence (audience vs. anonymous) conditions. \n  Fig. 2   \n\nFinally, there was a main effect of peer presence,   F  (1, 127) =\u200943.11,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.25, which was qualified by a two-way interaction between giving condition and peer presence,   F  (1, 127) =\u200912.36,   p  \u2009=\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.09. As can be seen in  , participants gave more in the audience condition than in the anonymous condition, but the audience effect was more pronounced in the small giving condition (  M   = 73.39,   SD   =   17.35  ; M   = 69.40  , SD   = 18.21) compared to the large giving condition (  M   = 48.02,   SD   =   13.03  ; M   = 46.60  , SD   = 11.25). There was no interaction between target and audience, nor was there a three-way interaction. \n\n\n#### Age effects on giving \n  \nTo examine effects of age on giving behavior, linear and quadratic age were added as covariates to the repeated-measures ANOVA. This analysis yielded a three-way interaction between age, giving condition, and target,   F  (1, 126) =\u20095.66,   p  \u2009=\u2009.019,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.04 (uncorrected for multiple comparisons). Follow-up analyses showed a trend towards increased differentiation between targets in the small giving condition (\u0394  B   =  .94;   F  (1, 126) =\u20093.17,   p  \u2009=\u2009.077,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.03) compared to the large giving condition (\u0394  B   =  .18;   F  (1, 126) =\u20090.38,   p  \u2009=\u2009.537,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.00); see  . In the large giving condition, there was a general age-related decrease in giving behavior (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.18,   p  \u2009=\u2009.047). There were no other linear age effects, nor where there any quadratic age effects.   \nAssociations between age and the mean percentage of given coins for friend and unfamiliar peer in the small and large giving condition. \n  Fig. 3   \n\n\n#### Reaction times \n  \nTo examine differences in reaction times depending on task conditions, we performed a repeated measures ANOVA with giving condition (small vs. large), target (friend vs. unfamiliar peer), and peer presence (audience vs. anonymous giving) as within-subject variables and reaction time in milliseconds as dependent variable. We found a main effect of target,   F  (1, 127) =\u200915.86,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.11, which was qualified by a giving condition x target interaction,   F  (1, 127) =\u20098.37,   p  \u2009=\u2009.004,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.06. Follow-up analyses revealed no differences in RTs between the friend and unfamiliar peer in the small giving condition,   F  (1, 127) =\u20091.55,   p  \u2009=\u2009.215,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.00,   M   =\u20091038.22,   SD   =\u2009176.58,   M   =\u20091028.19,   SD   =\u2009192.94, but longer RTs for giving to a friend compared to an unfamiliar peer in the large giving condition,   F  (1, 127) =\u20095.60,   p  \u2009=\u2009.020,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.04,   M   =\u20091049.66,   SD   =\u2009186.30,   M   =\u20091028.19,   SD   =\u2009192.94 (see  ).   \n(A) Reaction times in milliseconds associated with giving to a friend and unfamiliar peer in the small and large giving conditions. Error bars represent the standard error. (B) Associations between age and reaction times in milliseconds in the small and large giving conditions with the audience present. There was a larger age-related decrease in RT for the small compared to the large condition when audience was present. \n  Fig. 4   \n\nWith regard to peer presence, results were only significant at an uncorrected threshold (i.e.,   p  \u2009=\u2009.05): there was a main effect of peer presence,   F  (1, 127) =\u20095.33,   p  \u2009=\u2009.023,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.04, such that reaction times were longer in the audience (  M   = 1048.34,   SD   = 195.03) compared to the anonymous (  M   = 1023.79,   SD   = 184.62) condition. Adding linear age to the analysis revealed a three-way interaction between audience, giving condition, and age,   F  (1, 126) =\u20096.02,   p  \u2009=\u2009.016,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.05. Follow up analyses revealed an interaction between giving condition and age in the audience,   F  (1, 126) =\u20094.27,   p  \u2009=\u2009.041,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.03 but not the anonymous condition\u00b8\u2009  p  \u2009=\u2009.465. As shown in  , there was a larger age-related decrease in RT for the small compared to the large condition when audience was present. There were no other linear age effects, and no quadratic age effects. \n\n\n\n### Neural results \n  \n#### Confirmatory ROI analyses \n  \nFor the confirmatory ROI analyses, we performed similar repeated measures ANOVAs with giving condition (small vs. large), target (friend vs. unfamiliar peer), and peer presence (audience vs. anonymous giving) as within-subject variables and ROI activity as dependent variable. Results are outlined below for each ROI. For the mPFC, there was a main effect of giving condition,   F   (1, 127) =\u200912.18,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.09, such that activation was higher in the small (  M   =0.38,   SD   = 2.14) compared to large giving condition   (M   = \u22120.05,   SD   = 2.20), see  A. There were no significant effects of target and peer presence.   \nTask condition effects in pre-defined ROIs. (A) The mPFC showed more activation (i.e., less de-activation) in the small compared to large giving condition. (B) The insula showed an interaction between target and audience, such that there was a difference between activation for the friend and unfamiliar peer in the audience but not anonymous condition. Error bars represent the standard error. Abbreviations: mPFC =\u2009medial prefrontal cortex. \n  Fig. 5   \n\nFor the AI, there was a main effect of target,   F   (1, 127) =\u20097.64,   p  \u2009=\u2009.007,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.06, such that activity was higher for the friend than unfamiliar peer. This effect was qualified by an interaction between target and audience,   F   (1, 127) =\u200910.37,   p  \u2009=\u2009.002,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.08. As can be seen in  B, there was a difference in AI activation between the friend and unfamiliar peer in the audience giving condition,   F   (1, 127) =\u200913.91,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.01,   M   =\u20090.77,   SD   =  \u20091.40  ; M  =\u20090.43  , SD   =\u20091.53, but not in the anonymous condition,   M   =\u20090.71,   SD   =  \u20091.48  ; M  =\u20090.72  , SD   =\u20091.46. For the AI ROI, there was no effect of giving condition and there were no further interactions. \n\nFinally, contrary to predictions, there were no significant effects for the nAcc, dACC TPJ and LPFC. See   for an overview of activation in all ROIs for each of the task conditions. \n\n\n#### Confirmatory ROI age analyses \n  \nAdding linear and quadratic age to the confirmatory ROI analyses revealed no age effects. \n\n\n#### Whole brain analysis examining task conditions \n  \nTo examine neural responses at the whole brain level, we performed a whole-brain full factorial ANOVA with giving condition (small vs. large), target (friend vs. unfamiliar peer) and peer presence (audience vs. anonymous giving) as within-subject factors. \n\nThe overall   F  -test of giving condition revealed activation in the mPFC, left postcentral gyrus, right precentral gyrus, left lingual gyrus, right precuneus and several other regions. Paired samples t-tests showed that the mPFC (see  A) and left calcarine were more active in the small compared to large giving condition,   t\u2019s  \u2009\u2265\u20094.85  , p  's\u2009\u2264\u20090.001. The left lingual, right precentral gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, and right precuneus were more active in the large compared to small giving condition,   t\u2019s  \u2009\u2265\u20094.34  , p  's\u2009\u2264\u20090.001, see  .   \n(A) Whole-brain t-test for the small versus large giving condition. (B) Whole-brain t-test for friend versus unfamiliar peer. Results are displayed with a primary voxel-wise threshold of p\u2009<\u2009.001 (uncorrected) and FDR cluster correction of p\u2009<\u2009.05. (C) Activation in the precuneus in the small and large giving condition for friend and unfamiliar peer, showing an interaction between giving condition and target. Specifically, activation was higher for the friend in the large giving condition, and higher for the unfamiliar peer in the small giving condition. Error bars represent the standard error. \n  Fig. 6     \nMNI coordinates of local maxima activated for the F-test and t-test for small >\u2009large giving condition. Results were calculated using a primary voxel-wise threshold of p\u2009<\u2009.001 (uncorrected), with a cluster corrected threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 FDR corrected. \n  Table 1     \n\nThe main   F  -test of target revealed activation in the bilateral TPJ, right SMA (i.e., supplementary motor area), right lateral PFC, left precuneus, left caudate, right insula and various other regions, see  . Paired samples t-tests revealed that all brain regions were more active for friend than unfamiliar peer,   t  's\u2009\u2265\u20093.91,   p  's\u2009\u2264\u20090.001, with bilateral TPJ, right SMA, and right lateral PFC surviving FDR cluster correction, see  B.   \nMNI coordinates of local maxima activated for the F-test and t-test for friend >\u2009unfamiliar peer.

The reversed unfamiliar peer >\u2009friend contrast did not result in significant effects. \n  Table 2     \n\nThe main effect (i.e.,   F  -test) of audience revealed activation in the left lingual and right fusiform gyrus, see  . Paired samples t-tests revealed that all brain regions were more active for the audience compared to anonymous condition,   t  's\u2009\u2265\u20093.81,   p  's\u2009\u2264\u20090.001.   \nMNI coordinates of local maxima activated for the F-test and t-test for audience >\u2009anonymous giving.

The reversed anonymous >\u2009audience contrast did not result in significant effects. \n  Table 3     \n\nAs indicated by an F-test, there was an interaction between giving condition and target, see  . Follow up   t  -tests revealed an interaction in the precuneus, left lingual gyrus, and right fusiform gyrus. To examine the effect in the precuneus in more detail, we used the Marsbar toolbox to extract activation for this cluster. As can be seen in  C, in the precuneus, activation in the small giving condition was higher for unfamiliar peer (  M   = 3.05, SD = 1.98) compared to friend (  M   = 2.58, SD = 1.91),   F  (1, 127) =\u200912.54,   p  \u2009=\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.09; whereas in the large giving condition activation was higher for friend (  M   = 2.78, SD = 1.84) than unfamiliar peer (  M   = 2.30, SD =0.1.82),   F  (1, 127) =\u200911.69,   p  \u2009=\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00b2  =\u2009.08.   \nMNI coordinates of local maxima activated for the F-test and (negative) t-test for the interaction between giving condition and target.

The reversed positive contrast did not result in significant effects. \n  Table 4     \n\n\n#### Exploratory Whole Brain Age Analyses \n  \nRegarding magnitude giving condition, there was a positive linear association between age and activation in lateral and anterior PFC regions, see  . To investigate the effect in the left anterior and left lateral PFC in more detail we used the Marsbar toolbox to extract activation for these clusters. As shown in  , older adolescents recruited the left lateral and anterior PFC more strongly when giving small versus large amounts. There were no significant age effects relating to the whole brain contrasts for target or peer presence.   \nMNI coordinates of local maxima activated for linear age regressions for giving condition and target.

The contrast \u2018minimal vs. generous giving\u2019 in the small giving condition and the reverse contrast \u2018generous vs. minimal giving\u2019 in the large giving condition both resulted in increased activation in mPFC and bilateral AI, see   and  . No significant linear or quadratic age effects were found.   \nIncreased activation in the mPFC and bilateral insula for minimal vs. generous giving (i.e., giving 1 vs. 2 or 3 coins) in the small giving condition, and for generous vs. minimal giving (i.e., giving 5 or 6 coins) in the large giving condition. \n  Fig. 8     \nMNI coordinates of local maxima activated for the t-tests minimal >\u2009generous giving in the small giving condition and generous >\u2009minimal giving in the large giving condition.

The first aim was to examine behavioral and neural profiles of giving in small (low personal cost) versus large size (high personal cost) giving conditions. The second aim was to examine whether these behaviors and neural patterns were dependent on whether the target was a friend or unfamiliar peer. The third aim tested giving that was being observed by peers relative to giving anonymously. Behaviorally, adolescents gave more in the small than in the large giving condition, suggesting that participants were more generous when personal costs were relatively low. Moreover, especially in the small size giving condition, adolescents gave more to friends than to strangers, and gave more when observed by peers. With respect to age differences, we found that older participants differentiated more between giving to friends and unfamiliar others, specifically in the small size giving condition. These findings are consistent with our pre-registered hypotheses 1\u20132 and with prior studies showing a developmental increase in target differentiation when giving to others in adolescence ( ,  ). The target differentiation was specific to the small giving condition in our study. This could reflect biased giving rates towards friends for small (low personal cost) giving, but also more equitable giving towards friends and unfamiliar peers for large (high personal cost) giving. This suggests that the magnitude of giving could be an important factor for minimizing group biases ( ,  ). Future studies should aim to further unravel how different dimensions of giving magnitudes (e.g., costliness and level of inequity) interact in shaping giving decisions towards in- and out-group targets. \n\nOur observation of higher giving in the audience compared to anonymous condition, specifically in the small giving condition, is consistent with a prior study in adults ( ) and in adolescents ( ) and confirms hypothesis 3. Next, we observed longer reaction times for giving to a friend versus unfamiliar peer (specific to the large giving condition), and with the audience present. One interpretation for these effects is that adolescents give more deliberately in the friend and peer presence conditions due to concerns for their future reputation, as these conditions were also associated with higher levels of giving. Furthermore, our results suggest that older adolescents make faster giving decisions in the small compared to large giving condition when an audience was present, suggesting that such giving decisions are easier to make for older compared to younger adolescents. Together, the findings fit with a larger body of studies showing that adolescents\u2019 prosocial behaviors are influenced by social contextual factors ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\n### Neural correlates of small versus large size giving \n  \nThe next aim of this study was to examine the neural correlates of giving in adolescence with a task design optimized for comparing giving small (low costly) versus large (high costly) amounts. Consistent with a prior study in adults using the same paradigm ( ), and with pre-registered hypothesis 5, we found that adolescents showed stronger activity in a pre-defined mPFC ROI in the small versus large giving condition, which was confirmed by the whole brain analyses. This finding fits with a larger set of neuroimaging studies focused on giving decisions in adults showing involvement of the mPFC, a region which often co-activates with the superior temporal sulcus, ventral striatum, AI, and TPJ, and IPL ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). However, here were observed no activation for small versus large size giving in the following pre-defined ROIS: the nAcc, dACC,TPJ, and LPFC. \n\nNext, we performed exploratory whole brain analyses to examine whether the neural signature of giving was influenced by participants\u2019 generosity within the small and large giving condition. The mPFC and AI showed dependency on giving decisions within the small and large giving conditions, similar to previous findings in adults ( ). Both the mPFC and AI correlated with the most extreme choices, including minimal giving in the small giving condition (relative to generous giving), and generous giving in the large giving condition (relative to minimal giving; partly confirming hypothesis 5). These findings provide evidence for a role of the mPFC and AI in detecting norm violations or saliency ( ,  ,  ,  ). It should be noted that in adults, these regions were most strongly activated for generous giving independent of giving magnitude context ( ). Combined, these findings could reflect a developmental shift from multiple-context saliency detection in adolescents (i.e., minimal giving and generosity) to saliency detection for generosity in adulthood. Future studies should follow-up this hypothesis using longitudinal assessments to examine within-person changes, and novel designs to separate contextual restrictions on giving (small versus large giving conditions) with participants\u2019 actual giving preferences (e.g., minimal or generous giving). \n\nTo address developmental effects, we examined age differences in pre-defined ROIs. Contrary to our expectations, none of these ROI analyses resulted in developmental patterns. However, exploratory whole brain analyses revealed an age-related increase in lateral and anterior PFC activation for giving small (low-costly) versus large (high-costly) amounts. Inspection of the developmental pattern shows a shift from more lateral/anterior PFC activity in the large giving condition early in adolescence, to the small giving condition later in adolescence. Developmental increases in LPFC activation have been well documented in prior studies on cognitive control ( ), receiving trust ( ), and emotion regulation development ( ). Possibly, the lateral PFC plays an important regulatory role in balancing needs for self and others; for instance by inhibiting impulses or integrating norms into decisions ( ). It should be noted that the pre-registered ROIs also included a dlPFC region, but the whole brain contrasts showed that developmental differences were most pronounced in a different area of the prefrontal cortex. Apart from the dlPFC, this study showed other discrepancies between ROI and whole brain analyses. This includes no ROI peer presence effects, but whole brain effects in the fusiform and lingual gyrus; and no ROI target effects except for the mPFC, whereas whole brain analyses revealed differences in several regions of interest, such as the TPJ-IPL and lateral prefrontal cortex. These discrepancies have several broader implications. First, it shows the importance of carefully selecting ROIs. ROIs that are based on a synthesis of prior research (i.e., are created through Neurosynth) may be less anatomically and functionally demarcated than ROIs that are based on one specific study that measures the exact construct of interest. Second, it shows that even though pre-registration is useful to formulate a priori hypotheses, exploratory analyses are an important additional way to capture meaningful neural activation that might otherwise be overlooked, especially for novel experimental paradigms. This can result in interesting new hypotheses for future research. Third, it highlights the importance of performing neuroimaging research in developmental samples, such that ROIs are not only applicable to adult neural activation, but also to developing neural activation patterns. Fourth, it highlights that the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience would benefit from a consensus on how to weigh a priori, confirmatory ROI analyses versus whole brain exploratory analyses. ROI analyses boost statistical power and therefore lead to more robust results, but are only valid when the ROIs are selected carefully and appropriately for the sample of interest. Whole brain exploratory analyses can identify neural activation that was not hypothesized but are marked by decreased spatial certainty and resolution because of normalization and spatial smoothing ( ). In short, both ROI and whole brain analyses have strengths and weaknesses, which is why it is beneficial to combine both approaches in one study. \n\nThe current experimental design was optimized for comparing small versus large giving, and therefore differed from prior operationalizations of the Dictator Game, the economic game traditionally used to study giving. Most prior neuroimaging studies, the majority of which were performed in adults, used operationalizations where the participant could 1) either reject or accept a pre-defined donation, or 2) choose between two proposed pay-offs ( ,  ). In these studies, relatively generous choices were associated with activation in the ventral striatum, mPFC and LPFC, especially when made voluntarily ( ,  ,  ). The current paradigm adds to this literature by showing that mPFC and AI were activated for both minimal versus generous giving in adolescents, possibly reflecting either feelings of generosity ( ) or saliency detection ( ). Overall, the current literature would benefit from developmental studies with experimental designs, which explicitly consider factors such as saliency, voluntarity, generalizability, and the presence of extrinsic rewards. \n\n\n### Neural correlates of familiarity and audience effects \n  \nThe second and third aim of this study were to test whether neural correlates of giving considerations were dependent on whether the target was a friend or unfamiliar peer and whether participants were observed by an audience or decisions were anonymous. From all pre-registered ROIs, the AI was the only region showing sensitivity to these social contextual manipulations. Specifically, the AI showed stronger activity when giving to friends compared to unfamiliar peers, but only in the audience condition, whereas activation between friends and unfamiliar peers did not differ in the anonymous condition. These findings possibly reveal that the audience condition amplifies social concern or saliency for friends ( ). Across adolescent development, the peer context becomes an important additional social consideration. For example, a prior developmental study showed that adolescents increasingly consider friends\u2019 outcomes in their decision making throughout adolescence and into young adulthood ( ). There is by now accumulating evidence that the peer context is associated with increased reward sensitivity at the neural level, which is related to both risky and prosocial behaviors ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Adolescents\u2019 orientation and motivation to be accepted by and gain status among their peers drive many goal-directed behaviors, resulting in increased saliency in situations where this can be achieved ( ). \n\nContrary to predictions, no target or peer presence effects were observed in the mPFC ROI ( ). This finding seemingly contradicts a plethora of studies suggesting stronger mPFC activity in adolescents in social fMRI tasks which require mentalizing, including assessments of reading the mind in the eyes ( ), social perspective taking ( ), and reciprocity ( ,  ). Possibly, the social manipulations used in this study put less demands on mentalizing compared to other studies. For example, prior studies have shown that peer monitoring and influence have larger effects on both risk taking ( ,  ) and giving behavior ( ) than peer presence per se, and this might require different levels of mentalizing. To further explore this possibility, future studies should examine social influence effects using more diversity in peer influences. \n\nA second unexpected finding was the absence of developmental effects in the a priori defined TPJ. Prior studies have revealed TPJ activation in response to peer presence during giving ( ), and trust and reciprocity decisions ( ,  ), suggesting that the TPJ is an important region for taking the perspective of others and moderating behavioral choices ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). In the current study, exploratory whole brain analyses demonstrated stronger anterior IPL/TPJ activity when giving to friends than to unfamiliar peers, consistent with a prior study in adults ( ). The TPJ and IPL are congeneric parietal regions comprising of sub regions that fulfill different roles in a global function of mentalizing, integrating social contexts, and thinking about self and others ( ,  ,  ). However, despite prior studies that show increased activation in the TPJ with increasing age for fair decisions ( ,  ), in the current study we observed no age effects in this region, possibly because the age range was relatively narrow to detect developmental differences. \n\nThe exploratory whole brain analyses revealed additional activation for giving to friends versus unfamiliar peers in the SMA and dlPFC, regions often implicated in cognitive control ( ) and positive affect, including peer acceptance ( ). Prior studies have implicated the dlPFC and TPJ, which both showed sensitivity to target in this study, as possible neural facilitators of perspective taking ( ). It is an intriguing question for future research whether perspective taking can be trained, and whether this reduces in- versus out-group differentiation. \n\nWe also addressed possible interactions between giving and social contextual factors. In whole brain analyses we observed target x giving condition dependent activation in the precuneus, a region involved in self- versus other-referential processing and perspective taking ( ,  ). Specifically, activation was higher for the friend in the large giving condition, and higher for the unfamiliar peer in the small giving condition, which was accompanied by longer reaction times in these conditions. Prior studies have shown that the precuneus is strongly activated in situations where giving is relatively high-costly in terms of monetary or reputational outcomes, which might require additional deliberation ( ,  , van der Meulen et al., 2018). This would fit with a potential role of the precuneus in perspective taking ( ). \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nThis study had several limitations that should be addressed in future research. The first limitation is that the current study cross-sectionally examined age-related differences in generosity. The data described here represents the first measurement wave of the longitudinal Brainlinks study. In the future, the longitudinal within-subjects examinations of the development of giving and other prosocial behaviors acquired within this study can be used to address this limitation. Nonetheless, the current findings, combined with other studies, still inform why some contextual considerations (i.e., personal costs, target, peer presence) and brain systems are more or less influential on the development of giving behavior. A first important take-away is that there is converging evidence for a developmental increase in giving in adolescence specifically for the friend target, which underlines the importance of friends in adolescence. Studies that examined more general in- versus out-group giving ( ) or giving to different types of non-friend peers ( ) in adolescents observed no developmental increases. Here, we observed increased giving to friends relative to unfamiliar others in the context of small size giving, which is consistent with other studies in adolescents ( ). Importantly, the developmental sensitivity for giving to friends may be specific to mid-to-late adolescence, as earlier work found no developmental changes in giving to friends in 8\u201312-year-olds ( ). Adolescents\u2019 inclination for giving to friends is also evident in our neuroimaging findings. Here, we observed that the TPJ, SMA, dlPFC, and right insula were more sensitive to the friend versus unfamiliar target, while earlier studies in adults only reported involvement of the TPJ ( ). This suggests that additive emotional, saliency, and cognitive control processes may be involved for giving to a friend in adolescents compared to young adults. A second important take-away is that neural age-related differences were mainly observed in cortical, but not sub-cortical regions. This might reflect adolescents\u2019 tendency to use more cognitive-mentalizing strategies when performing social tasks as they grow older ( ), which is consistent with evidence from prior neuroimaging studies that examined strategic giving ( ; 2011;  ;  ). In these studies, increased recruitment of the TPJ and prefrontal regions were indicative of perspective taking and cognitive control. Together, this suggests that activation in cortical neural regions contributes to developmental changes and increased sophistication in giving across adolescence ( ). These suggestions should be addressed in future longitudinal studies with a within-subject design. A second limitation of this study is that it only focused on two targets of giving: a friend and unfamiliar peer. While peer targets are important in adolescence ( ), our understanding of the neural and behavioral correlates of giving would benefit from including both peer- and non-peer targets (e.g., parents, siblings, acquaintances) with various degrees of familiarity in future studies. Third, the current sample was recruited through local and online advertisements, thereby possibly limiting the diversity of the sample. Future studies should test whether the current results replicate in more diverse samples (e.g., in terms of gender and ethnicity) and should try to reach underrepresented groups of adolescents. Fourth, the peer audience in our study was prerecorded and provided ratings of participants\u2019 behavior later in time, whereas other studies have used real-time audiences ( ; Somerville, 2013;  ). The lack of ROI results and unexpected whole brain results related to the audience condition may stem from the delayed timing or lower salience of our peer presence manipulation. Finally, future studies should include emerging young adults in addition to adolescents to fully understand changes related to the transition from adolescence into adulthood ( ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis study examined important contextual influences on giving behavior that have been understudied in prior studies in adolescents: giving magnitude (small versus large size giving), target (giving to a friend versus unfamiliar other), and peer presence (giving with an audience or anonymously), as well as possible differences across ages 9\u201319. We demonstrated that giving very small or very large amounts was associated with increased activity in the mPFC and AI. Furthermore, we demonstrated an age-related increase in lateral and anterior PFC activation across adolescent development for giving small versus large amounts, showing a developmental shift from stronger activity for large (high-costly) giving to small (low-costly) giving. Finally, with increasing age adolescents gave more to friends and less to unfamiliar peers, especially in the small giving context. Exploratory whole brain analyses revealed no overlap in brain regions pertaining to the target and peer presence contexts, suggesting that contextual factors have partly interactive and partly additive effects on giving. These results shed new light on the neural networks involved in balancing the needs of self and others, and highlight increasing in-group (friend) versus out-group differentiation in adolescence. \n\n\n## Data statement \n  \nResearch Data will be uploaded to Erasmus University Rotterdam\u2019s Data Repository upon acceptance.

This has motivated many cognitive-behavioral interventions for healthy aging, but little is known about the effects of music-based intervention (MBI) on activity and connectivity of the brain\u2019s auditory and reward systems. Here we show preliminary evidence that brain network connectivity can change after receptive MBI in cognitively unimpaired older adults. Using a combination of whole-brain regression, seed-based connectivity analysis, and representational similarity analysis (RSA), we examined fMRI responses during music listening in older adults before and after an 8-week personalized MBI. Participants rated self-selected and researcher-selected musical excerpts on liking and familiarity. Parametric effects of liking, familiarity, and selection showed simultaneous activation in auditory, reward, and default mode network (DMN) areas. Functional connectivity within and between auditory and reward networks was modulated by participant liking and familiarity ratings. RSA showed significant representations of selection and novelty at both time-points, and an increase in striatal representation of musical stimuli following intervention. An exploratory seed-based connectivity analysis comparing pre- and post-intervention showed significant increase in functional connectivity between auditory regions and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Taken together, results show how regular music listening can provide an auditory channel towards the mPFC, thus offering a potential neural mechanism for MBI supporting healthy aging. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nRecent interest in music has burgeoned as a tool for restoring function in the aging brain . The possibility that music can maintain or even restore cognitive and/or emotional function in old age hinges upon the observation that when listening to pleasurable music, areas in the auditory network are functionally connected with areas in the dopaminergic reward system, specifically medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) as well as dorsal and ventral striatum . The reward system is involved in motivated behavior  and is active during the processing of biologically relevant stimuli such as food, as well as cues that are tightly linked to biological stimuli, such as money . Reward system areas are also involved in the learning of associations between stimuli and their subjective value . This activity and connectivity of the reward system declines in old age, as supported by evidence for age-related decline in pre- and post-synaptic dopamine function in human striatum and midbrain . On the other hand, older adults have preserved brain activation of the striatum (caudate) to positively-valenced stimuli compared to younger adults . Since music can be a rich source of positively-valenced stimuli, using music as a means by which to stimulate the reward system may have enduring effects towards old age. \n\nDespite their known coactivity during music listening, little is understood about how connectivity between auditory and reward areas are modulated by familiarity and self-selection. Understanding the stimulus selection parameters that influence auditory-reward connectivity will inform studies on music, health, and well-being, with especially widespread implications for music therapy. As the evolutionary bases and social roles of music are subserved neurobiologically by the ability of music to stimulate the reward system , studying auditory-reward connectivity during music listening may inform these evolutionary functions of music as well. \n\nIn addition to activating the reward system, the experience of music engages multiple other brain systems such as sensorimotor and executive control networks , and is fundamentally psychologically intertwined with the listener\u2019s knowledge, autobiographical memories, and understanding of the intentions of the composer and the performer, through its structure and performance . These rich experiences are supported by activity in the default mode network (DMN), which encompasses the mPFC (which is also part of the reward network), along with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) or angular gyrus. The DMN is involved during self-generated thought  and is disrupted in activity and connectivity in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders and conditions such as depression and learned helplessness . \n\nAgency in the selection of music, or the ability to choose the music that one listens to, may provide the listener with a psychological platform to link the consequences of one\u2019s musical choices to perceptual predictive processes , giving rise to a relatively active mode of listening  that has implications for the health-relevance of music and the use of music in therapy . Listening to self-selected music reduces anxiety and improves task performance and enjoyment, compared to music selected by an experimenter . While previous fMRI studies suggest that the reward network and DMN are likely involved , there is little direct evidence for the involvement of these networks in self-selection of music listening per se. Since the mPFC is both within the DMN and in the reward network, testing how self-selected music activates these disparate networks may inform neuroscientific understanding about how the reward and default networks interact in the brain. \n\nHere we present the first report of task fMRI results on music listening before and after an ongoing music-based intervention (MBI) in cognitively unimpaired, community-dwelling older adults. MBIs are therapeutic strategies facilitated by music, and can be classified as either receptive if they are primarily focused on music listening, or interactive if they involve active engagement in music making activities . Receptive MBIs have been shown to reduce depressive symptoms in individuals with clinical depression  and to improve quality of life and emotional well-being, while decreasing anxiety for people with dementia . Relatedly, an 8-week intervention on mindfulness-based stress reduction has shown changes in reward-related fMRI activity and connectivity . Thus, we developed an 8-week receptive MBI program, based on previous research with older adults , and collected neuropsychological and neuroimaging measures both prior to and after participation in the intervention. Here we report preliminary evidence from the fMRI portion of the larger study. Through this project, we aim to investigate the effects of music liking, familiarity, and self-selection on reward processing before and after intervention, through a combination of whole-brain regression, seed-based analysis, and representational similarity analysis (RSA). \n\nOur predictions (preregistered here:  ) are twofold: first, we predict that brain responses to musical stimuli will be sensitive to differences in liking, familiarity, and self-selection. Specifically, from a whole-brain analysis, we expect higher brain activity when listening to musical stimuli that are well-liked, familiar, and self-selected. Second, we predict that the activity and connectivity within and between auditory and reward areas, as observed in region-of-interest (ROI) analyses, will be sensitive to differences in liking, familiarity, and self-selection. Finally, as an additional exploratory hypothesis, we expect some experience-dependent changes in how the brain responds to music over time, to be observed by comparing activity and connectivity in auditory and reward regions before and after MBI. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-two older adults met inclusion criteria to participate. Three of them dropped out during the first session for various reasons related to the MRI portion of the study, and three were lost-to-follow-up after the second session as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a final sample of 16 older adults (8 males and 8 females) with the mean age of 66.38 (  SD  \u2009=\u20098.74). Recruitment took place through craigslist.org and through coauthors (MG and ND) at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. Participants were included if they (1) were at least 50\u00a0years old, (2) passed MRI screening, and (3) had had no more than mild hearing loss as defined by a pure-tone audiogram showing less than 40\u00a0dB hearing loss, in accordance with the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. Participants were excluded if they (1) changed medications within 6\u00a0weeks of screening; (2) had a history of psychotic or schizophrenic episodes, major neurological diagnosis, or other medical condition that might impair cognition; (3) had a history of chemotherapy within the past 10\u00a0years; or (4) experienced serious physical trauma or were diagnosed with a serious chronic health condition requiring medical treatment and monitoring within 3\u00a0months of screening. Participants reported between 0 and 10+\u2009years of musical experience as assessed using the Gold-MSI . Eight participants reported receiving 0\u00a0years of musical training, one reported 1\u00a0year, three reported 3\u20135\u00a0years, one reported 6\u20139\u00a0years, and two participants reported 10+\u2009years. Fifteen of the participants listed English as their first language and one listed Russian. Participants were also asked if they were fluent in any other languages, to which one participant indicated fluency in Spanish. Recruitment for this study was significantly affected the COVID-19 pandemic as many individuals were nervous about participating in in-person research (see \u201c \u201d section for further details). Participants were compensated for their time. This study was approved by the Northeastern University Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. All research was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines/regulations, and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nPrior to their enrollment, participants completed a pre-screening by telephone. Participants were screened for the inclusion and exclusion criteria and completed the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS)  with a score of\u2009\u2265\u200931/41 considered cognitively normal and an MRI pre-entry screening form. They were also asked to provide the researcher with the names of six musical pieces they enjoy listening to. Participants who passed pre-screening were invited to the lab for a pre-intervention session, which included a battery of neuropsychological tests and behavioral measures, an MRI, and a blood draw. The neuropsychological tests were administered by a trained researcher, and the behavioral measures were completed through an online survey. Later that week, participants were invited back to the lab to meet with a music therapist for an assessment of their musical preferences and creation of two personalized playlists for the MBI (see \u201c \u201d section). At the end of the 8-week intervention period (12\u00a0weeks for the 2 participants enrolled during COVID-19; see \u201c \u201d section), participants returned to the lab for a post-MBI session to complete the same battery of neuropsychological tests and behavioral measures administered during the first session, as well as a post-intervention MRI and blood draw. See Fig.\u00a0  for a timeline of the procedure. For the present manuscript, we report data from the task fMRI portion of the study; data from the neuropsychological battery and the behavioral measures will be reported separately.   \nStudy timeline and fMRI experiment design. \n  \n\n\n### Special considerations due to COVID-19 \n  \nData collection for this study began in July of 2019, and had been completed per protocol on 10 participants before the United States entered a COVID-19-related lockdown. Two participants included in the final sample were actively undergoing MBI when the lockdown began in March 2020. For those two participants, the music intervention was extended to 12\u00a0weeks rather than the typical 8\u00a0weeks, to complete the intervention as intended. Resumption of Research Plan was developed and approved in consultation with the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Northeastern University. Removing those two participants did not alter the overall pattern of results, thus they were analyzed along with the rest of the sample. The remaining 4 participants in the final sample were enrolled during the COVID-19 pandemic, and underwent an 8-week MBI and performed both pre- and post-intervention testing in compliance with the COVID-specific Resumption of Research plan. \n\nFor our COVID-specific Resumption of Research plan: consenting and neuropsychological testing were done via a HIPAA-compliant version of Zoom to minimize the amount of time participants spent in the lab for in-person data collection. Participants were called 1\u00a0day before their scheduled session, screened using a COVID-19 pre-screener based on the COVID-19 CDC guidelines, and were provided with the lab\u2019s IRB-approved COVID-19-compliant guidelines. If participants answered no to all of COVID-19 pre-screener questions, they were invited to come in for their session the next day. After arriving for their session, participants were screened again using the same COVID-19 pre-screener and their temperatures were taken. If participants answered no to all of the questions and had a temperature reading of less than 100.4\u00b0F, then they were invited into the lab. Participants and researchers wore full personal protective equipment (PPE: surgical masks, face shields, lab coats, and surgical gloves) and were socially distanced as much as possible during the onsite portions of the study, and the lab was disinfected before and after each session. In the MRI, when alone in the scanner, participants were allowed the option of taking their masks off. Recent fMRI studies suggest that wearing a mask during the scan does not significantly affect task activation . \n\n\n### Music-based intervention \n  \nThe current approach to MBI was based on a previously developed music therapy protocol that was shown by a randomized, controlled trial to be successful in improving symptoms of depression, anxiety, and distress in older adults diagnosed with mild or moderate depression . Subsequent research applied this intervention to other clinical settings, and condensed the music used into two manageable playlists, composed of energizing and relaxing music . Thus, MBI was personalized in that each participant met (in-person or virtually) with a board-certified music therapist to help curate playlists. Participants built and modified their playlists for the MBI independent of what pieces they initially selected to listen to in the scanner. \n\nPrior to the start of the MBI, a Premium YouTube Music account was created for each participant for music listening. At the start of the MBI, participants met with a board-certified music therapist who familiarized them with the YouTube Music platform and assessed their music preferences. An energizing playlist and a relaxing playlist, of approximately 25 pieces of music each, were compiled in consultation with the music therapist, beginning with the six favorite pieces selected during pre-screening. Participants built and modified their playlists for the MBI independent of what pieces they initially selected to listen to in the scanner. Some of the chosen playlists used in MBI (the energizing and relaxing playlists) overlapped with the 6 pieces used in the scanner, but this was not a requirement for the MBI or for the self-selection of pieces to be included in the scanner task. On average, participants' energizing playlist contained 2.25 (std 2.21) of their self-selected pieces at the beginning of the intervention, and 1.69 (1.54) at the end of intervention. Participants' relaxing playlist contained 2.44 (2.22) of their self-selected pieces at the beginning of the intervention, and 2.38 (2.09) at the end of intervention. The music therapist instructed participants to listen to their choice of selections from one or both of their playlists for one hour daily, over the course of the next 8\u00a0weeks. They were asked to pay attention to how the music affected their moods and emotions, while noting any memories, images, or associations with the music. After each focused listening experience, participants recorded these reflections and self-observations in a journal. Once a week, the music therapist called the participant to discuss their compliance and responses to the daily listening, and to help them add or remove pieces from their playlists. Prior to COVID-19, the start of the MBI occurred in person; however, during COVID-19, participants met with the music therapist over Zoom. \n\n\n### fMRI task \n  \nThe fMRI task consisted of 24 trials altogether. In each trial, participants were first presented with a musical stimulus (lasting 20\u00a0s), then they were given the task of rating how familiar they found the music to be (familiarity rating lasted 2\u00a0s), and how much they liked the music (liking rating also lasted 2\u00a0s). Musical stimuli for the MRI task consisted of 24 different audio excerpts. Each auditory stimulus was from one of the following three categories: participant self-selected music (6/24 stimuli), other-selected (researcher-selected) music including well-known excerpts spanning multiple musical genres  (10/24 stimuli) and novel music spanning multiple genres (8/24 stimuli). A list of the researcher-selected musical selections is given in Supplementary Materials Table  . Stimuli were presented in a randomized order, and participants made ratings of familiarity and liking on the scales of 1 to 4: for familiarity: 1\u2009=\u2009very unfamiliar, 2\u2009=\u2009unfamiliar, 3\u2009=\u2009familiar, 4\u2009=\u2009very familiar; for liking: 1\u2009=\u2009hate, 2\u2009=\u2009neutral, 3\u2009=\u2009like, 4\u2009=\u2009love. Participants made these ratings by pressing a corresponding button on a button-box (Cambridge Research Systems) inside the scanner. Participants wore MR-compatible over-the-ear headphones (Cambridge Research Systems) over musician-grade silicone ear plugs during MRI data acquisition. The spatial mapping between buttons and the numerical categories of ratings were counterbalanced between participants to reduce any systematic association between familiarity or liking and the motor activity resulting from making responses. This fMRI task was completed before and after the MBI. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nImages were acquired using a Siemens Magnetom 3\u00a0T MR scanner with a 64-channel head coil at Northeastern University. For task fMRI data, continuous acquisition was used for 1440 volumes with a fast TR of 475\u00a0ms, for a total acquisition time of 11.4\u00a0min. Forty-eight axial slices (slice thickness\u2009=\u20093\u00a0mm, anterior to posterior, z volume\u2009=\u200914.4\u00a0mm) were acquired as echo-planar imaging (EPI) functional volumes covering the whole brain (TR\u2009=\u2009475\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u200930\u00a0ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200960\u00b0, FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u00a0mm, voxel size\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093 mm ). \n\nT1 images were also acquired using a MPRAGE sequence, with one T1 image acquired every 2400\u00a0ms, for a total task time of approximately 7\u00a0min. Sagittal slices (0.8\u00a0mm thick, anterior to posterior) were acquired covering the whole brain (TR\u2009=\u20092400\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u20092.55\u00a0ms, flip angle\u2009=\u20098\u00b0, FOV\u2009=\u2009256, voxel size\u2009=\u20090.8\u2009\u00d7\u20090.8\u2009\u00d7\u20090.8 mm ). Resting state and diffusion tensor imaging data were also collected, but as they are outside the scope of the present study, they will be reported in another manuscript. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Preprocessing \n  \nTask fMRI data was preprocessed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) software  with the CONN Toolbox . Preprocessing steps included functional realignment and unwarp, functional centering, functional slice time correction, functional outlier detection using the artifact detection tool, functional direct segmentation and normalization to MNI template, structural centering, structural segmentation and normalization to MNI template, and functional smoothing to an 8\u00a0mm gaussian kernel . Denoising steps for fMRI data included white matter and cerebrospinal fluid confound correction , and bandpass filtering to 0.008\u20130.09\u00a0Hz. \n\n\n#### Univariate whole-brain analysis \n  \nResponse data from the fMRI task were imported into R Studio, and onset values were extracted for each trial, including its liking rating (hate, neutral, like, love), familiarity rating (very unfamiliar, unfamiliar, familiar, very familiar), and music condition (self-selected, other-selected well-known, other-selected novel). Pre-intervention, four participants did not have onsets for the familiar condition (four participants did not feel that any of the stimuli were \u201cfamiliar\u201d to them), and four participants did not have onsets for the hate condition. Post-intervention, two participants were missing onsets for unfamiliar, one for familiar, one for neutral, and one for hate. Additionally, one of our participants post-intervention was missing all data for familiarity ratings due to a technical error. \n\nFirst- and second-level analyses were completed in SPM12 and visualized through CONN. For each participant, data were converted from 4 to 3D images, resulting in 1440 scans. The model was specified using the following criteria: interscan interval\u2009=\u20090.475\u00a0s, microtime resolution\u2009=\u200916, microtime onset\u2009=\u20098, duration\u2009=\u200942. Only data from the time while the participant was listening to the musical excerpt (rather than when the participant was making the familiarity and liking ratings) were included in this model. At the first-level, the following contrasts were extracted both pre- and post-intervention: the parametric effect of liking (linear contrast with all liking ratings), the parametric effect of familiarity (linear contrast with all familiarity ratings), and self-selected\u2009>\u2009other-selected music. The resulting first-level contrasts were then analyzed using a one-sample t-test across all participants at the second level. Results from the second-level analyses were statistically corrected using a cluster and voxel threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (FDR-corrected). Univariate pre-intervention and post-intervention effects of liking, familiarity, and self-selection did not differ at the whole-brain FDR-corrected level. We thus combined pre- and post-intervention scans in a conjunction analysis to show the effects that were common to both stages of the longitudinal study . Whole-brain results were rendered to a standard MNI brain. \n\n\n#### Seed-based connectivity analysis \n  \nSeed-based connectivity analysis was performed using the CONN toolbox to determine changes in functional connectivity after participation in MBI. Seed ROIs consisted of Auditory and Reward networks defined by previous work in our lab , with the effect of session used as a between-conditions contrast (post-intervention\u2009>\u2009pre-intervention). Significant clusters from these comparisons were then processed as new ROI masks, and beta time-series for these ROIs were extracted and compared trial-by-trial across the four liking and familiarity ratings for each participant. \n\n\n#### Auditory and reward network connectivity \n  \nBeta-weights for a series of auditory and reward network ROIs  were extracted from participant\u2019s first-level SPM.mat files using the Marsbar Toolbox . Values associated with each liking rating (hate, neutral, like, love) and each familiarity rating (very unfamiliar, unfamiliar, familiar, very familiar) were separated for each participant and averaged across all stimuli with that particular rating. For each rating, beta-weights were correlated across all auditory regions (auditory-auditory), across all reward regions (reward-reward), and between auditory and reward regions (auditory-reward). \n\n\n#### Representational similarity analysis \n  \nRepresentational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) definition and comparisons were performed in MATLAB (Mathworks, R2020b) using tools from the RSA toolbox . RDMs used in this study were a combination of fMRI-derived RDMs and model RDMs. Selection and Novelty RDMs were generated by assigning each stimulus either a 1 or a 0 depending on if it was one of the six participant-selected stimuli or one of the 16 well-known stimuli (including self-selected and researcher-selected excerpts), respectively, and then subtracting each pair of stimulus values to form a binary difference matrix. The model RDM of Familiarity was defined as the difference in participant familiarity ratings between each pair of stimuli, and similarly the model of Liking used participant liking ratings. \n\nfMRI-derived RDMs were generated using ROI-specific beta timeseries information for each stimulus. Each fMRI-derived RDM was defined as one minus the correlation coefficient of each pair of stimuli\u2019s average beta timeseries for a given ROI. Regions of interest included in this analysis consist of the 14 networks defined by the Stanford FIND lab atlas , as well as 12 hypothesis-driven ROIs, including ROIs for bilateral anterior and posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG), bilateral Heschl\u2019s Gyri (HG), Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc), and supplementary motor area (SMA), the mPFC, and the PCC derived from CONN Default and Networks Atlas. Finally, we included auditory and reward networks as defined in a previous study. \n\nFirst-level, participant-specific RDMs were generated for each ROI at both pre-intervention and post-intervention timepoints, and then compared to model RDMs. ROI to model comparisons were achieved through two independent analysis pipelines. In the first analysis pipeline, each first-level fMRI-derived RDM was compared to models of Selection, Novelty, Liking, and Familiarity through 10,000-fold bootstrap resampling  to generate relatedness values for each participant between each ROI-Model pair. These values then underwent 50,000 fold permutation T-max testing in order to determine significant ROI Model relationships at each session, and to determine any significant differences between sessions. The second analysis pipeline averaged first-level RDMs in order to form second-level, participant-averaged RDMs. These second-level RDMs were then visualized using second order multidimensional scaling . \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nTable   shows the means and SEs of liking and familiarity ratings of different stimulus types, before and after the intervention. We ran two repeated-measures ANOVAs, one for the liking ratings and one for the familiarity ratings, to determine the main effects of time (pre-intervention vs post-intervention)\u00a0and stimulus type, and the time \u00d7 stimulus type interaction.   \nDescriptive statistics for liking and familiarity behavioral data. \n  \n\n#### Liking \n  \nFor liking ratings, there was a significant main effect of stimulus type (F(2, 30)\u2009=\u2009103.8, p\u2009<\u20090.001,   = 0.874). Average ratings for self-selected stimuli were significantly higher than for well-known and novel stimuli (p\u2009<\u20090.001 Bonferroni-corrected), and ratings for the well-known stimuli were higher than for novel stimuli (p\u2009<\u20090.001 Bonferroni-corrected). There was no significant main effect of time (F(1, 15)\u2009=\u20094.330, p\u2009=\u20090.055,   = 0.224). There was, however, a significant time \u00d7 stimulus type interaction (F(1.4, 30)\u2009=\u20097.18, p\u2009=\u20090.009,   = 0.14), where well-known and novel stimuli were rated higher pre-intervention than post-intervention, but ratings for self-selected stimuli were rated higher post- than pre-intervention. \n\n\n#### Familiarity \n  \nFor familiarity ratings, there was a significant main effect of stimulus type (F(2,28)\u2009=\u2009307.7, p\u2009<\u20090.001,   = 0.956). Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons revealed that average familiarity ratings for self-selected stimuli were significantly higher than those for well-known (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and novel stimuli (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and familiarity ratings for the well-known stimuli were greater than for novel stimuli (p\u2009<\u20090.001). There was no significant main effect of time (F(1, 14)\u2009=\u20090.343, p\u2009=\u20090.567,   = 0.024), and no significant time \u00d7 stimulus type interaction (F(1.4, 28)\u2009=\u20092.590, p\u2009=\u20090.114,   = 0.156). \n\n\n\n### Whole-brain univariate effects of liking, familiarity, and self-selection \n  \nOur first hypothesis, i.e. that brain responses to musical stimuli would be sensitive to differences in liking, familiarity, and self-selection, was tested using parametric contrasts on liking and familiarity ratings, and a contrast between self-selected and other-selected music. Whole-brain effects for each liking rating, each familiarity rating, and each stimulus type can be found in  , and in Supplementary Materials Figs.  \u2013 . \n\n#### Parametric effect of liking \n  \nFigure\u00a0 A and Table   show the whole-brain corrected univariate, second-level parametric effects of liking ratings at the p\u2009<\u20090.05 voxelwise and clusterwise FDR-corrected level. A parametric effect of liking was observed in auditory regions including bilateral STG, superior temporal sulcus (STS), and middle temporal gyrus (MTG); and DMN regions (including mPFC, PCC, and TPJ/inferior parietal lobule (IPL)).   \nConjunction analysis of pre- and post-intervention univariate whole-brain results. (  A  ) Parametric effects of liking. Auditory (STG, STS, MTG), reward and DMN (mPFC and PCC) regions showed activity that varied parametrically with liking ratings. (  B  ) Parametric effects of familiarity. Auditory and DMN regions showed activity that also varied parametrically with familiarity ratings. (  C  ) Self-selected\u2009>\u2009Other-selected music. Greater widespread engagement was observed in auditory, reward, and DMN regions for self-selected music compared to other-selected music. All images are results of second-level analyses showing significant clusters at the p\u2009<\u20090.05 FDR-corrected level. \n    \nConjunction analysis of pre- and post-intervention. \n  \nVoxel Threshold: p FDR corrected\u2009<\u20090.05; Cluster Threshold: p FDR\u2009<\u20090.05. \n  \n\n\n#### Parametric effect of familiarity \n  \nFigure\u00a0 B and Table   show the whole-brain corrected univariate, second-level parametric effects of familiarity ratings, again at the p\u2009<\u20090.05 voxelwise and clusterwise FDR-corrected level. A parametric effect of familiarity was observed in auditory regions (including bilateral STG, STS, and MTG); the PCC; and the precentral gyrus. \n\n\n#### Effect of self vs. other-selection \n  \nFigure\u00a0 C and Table   show the whole-brain corrected univariate, second-level contrast of self-selected vs. other-selected music listening, again at the p\u2009<\u20090.05 voxelwise and clusterwise FDR-corrected level. Self-selected music, compared to other-selected music, elicited greater activation in the bilateral auditory areas (including STG, STS, and MTG); DMN (including mPFC, PCC, TPJ/IPL, and parahippocampal gyrus). \n\n\n\n### Seed-based connectivity: post-intervention\u2009>\u2009pre-intervention \n  \nFigure\u00a0 A shows pre- and post-intervention activity for the highest liking rating, showing significant activity in DMN areas post-intervention but not pre-intervention, suggesting some change in how the brain responds to music over time. To formally test our hypothesis of experience-dependent changes in activity and connectivity of auditory and reward regions, we conducted seed-based connectivity analyses, using auditory regions as the seed ROI and comparing its functional connectivity patterns before and after MBI. Figure\u00a0 B shows seed-based functional connectivity from the seed ROIs of the auditory network, including HG, STG, STS, and MTG. A between-sessions contrast (Post-intervention\u2009>\u2009Pre-intervention) on functional connectivity maps seeded from the auditory network showed a significant positive cluster in the mPFC at the p\u2009<\u20090.05 FDR-corrected level, indicating higher functional connectivity post-intervention than pre-intervention in this region. Thus, auditory areas increased in their connectivity to the mPFC after the intervention. Since this specific location within mPFC was the only region that increased its functional connectivity with the auditory network, we extracted the beta-series from this significant mPFC cluster for further ROI-based analyses.   \nSeed-based connectivity from auditory ROIs. (  A  ) Cortical regions active during musical stimuli that received the highest liking rating (\u201cLove\u201d) pre- and post-intervention, showing significant activity in mPFC post-intervention but not pre-intervention. Voxelwise and clusterwise FDR-corrected p\u2009<\u20090.05. (  B  ) The mPFC showed a significant effect of session (post-intervention\u2009>\u2009pre-intervention) in auditory network seed-based functional connectivity (voxel height p\u2009<\u20090.001, uncorrected; cluster size p\u2009<\u20090.05, FDR corrected). (  C  ,  D  ) Time-series data of ROIs extracted from the positive contrast in (  B  ), representing post\u2009>\u2009pre-intervention increase in functional connectivity. (  C  ) Beta series for different liking and familiarity ratings pre- and post-intervention, showing an increase in beta post-intervention, representing increased functional connectivity between auditory regions and mPFC, for loved and very familiar music. (  D  ) Beta series for self-selected and other-selected, and for well-known and novel music listening, showing an increase in auditory-mPFC functional connectivity after intervention for self-selected music but not for other-selected music. This increase in functional connectivity was not observed when comparing well-known vs. novel music listening. (  E  ) Correlations between auditory and mPFC activity in beta values for the four levels of liking ratings before and after intervention. Each data point is one participant. Comparing across the panels from \u201cHate\u201d (lowest liking rating) to \u201cLove\u201d (highest liking rating) shows more correlated auditory and mPFC activity during high liking ratings compared to low liking ratings, with the between-participant correlation being highest after the intervention for stimuli that received higher ratings. \n  \n\n\n### ROI analysis \n  \nTo test our hypothesis that auditory and reward regions would be sensitive in their activity and connectivity to the self-selectedness of music, we extracted beta values from the auditory network and the mPFC from the reward network. Figure\u00a0 E shows between-participant correlations between auditory and mPFC areas, pre- and post-intervention for the four levels of liking ratings. While auditory and mPFC activity were positively correlated across all conditions, the correlation was highest (r\u2009=\u20090.75) for musical stimuli that received a \u201cLove\u201d rating. Furthermore, the between-participants correlation between auditory and mPFC regions were higher post-intervention than pre-intervention, suggesting an increase in auditory-reward connectivity over time. \n\nTo address the functional connectivity of auditory and reward regions over the time-course of listening to music, we extracted the time-series of beta values (TR\u2009=\u20090.475\u00a0s) from the significant mPFC cluster identified in the auditory seed-based connectivity analysis above, and compared them across conditions and across sessions. While there was no clear difference between the conditions in pre-intervention beta-series, a clear pattern emerged between conditions in the post-intervention beta-series, such that at the midpoint of the 20-s-long musical stimuli, beta values were highest for self-selected, highly familiar, and well-liked stimuli (Fig.\u00a0 C,D). In other words, auditory-reward connectivity increased over time especially for well-liked, familiar, and self-selected musical excerpts, but did not increase over time for well-known vs. novel pieces of music. \n\n\n### Relating behavioral ratings to auditory and reward ROI-to-ROI connectivity \n  \nFunctional connectivity within the auditory network, within the reward network, and between auditory and reward networks at the four levels of liking and familiarity were all significantly above chance, as shown in Fig.\u00a0 A,C. Treating functional connectivity between auditory-auditory, reward-reward, and auditory-reward regions as dependent variables, a series of repeated-measures ANOVAs (three for liking and three for familiarity) were run to determine the main effects of time (pre-intervention vs post-intervention) and\u00a0rating, and the time \u00d7 rating interaction.   \n(  A   and   C  ) Correlation matrices showing the relationship between auditory and reward regions for different liking (  A  ) and familiarity (  C  ) ratings. (  B   and   D  ) Bar graphs depicting overall connectivity between auditory-auditory, reward-reward, and auditory-reward regions for different liking (  B  ) and familiarity (  D  ) ratings. \n  \n\n#### Liking \n  \nFor auditory-auditory connectivity, there were no significant main effects of time (F(1, 10)\u2009=\u20090.150, p\u2009=\u20090.707,   = 0.015) or ratings (F(3, 30)\u2009=\u20092.104, p\u2009=\u20090.121,   = 0.174). There was, however, a significant time \u00d7 rating interaction (F(3, 30)\u2009=\u20093.068, p\u2009=\u20090.043,   = 0.235), where hate and neutral ratings had higher beta-weights pre-intervention than post-intervention, but like and love had higher beta-weights post-intervention compared to pre-intervention. For reward-reward connectivity, there was an effect of rating (F(3, 30)\u2009=\u20092.923, p\u2009=\u20090.050,   = 0.226). There was no significant main effect of time (F(1, 10)\u2009<\u20090.001, p\u2009=\u20090.994,   <0.001) or time \u00d7 rating interaction (F(3, 30)\u2009=\u20091.301, p\u2009=\u20090.292,   = 0.115). For auditory-reward connectivity, there was also no significant main effect of time (F(1, 10)\u2009=\u20090.001, p\u2009=\u20090.981,   < 0.001) or rating (F(3, 30)\u2009=\u20091.647, p\u2009=\u20090.199,   = 0.141) or time \u00d7 rating interaction (F(3, 30)\u2009=\u20091.912, p\u2009=\u20090.149,   = 0.160).

See Fig.\u00a0 D. \n\n\n\n### Representational similarity \n  \nA representational similarity analysis (methods outlined in Fig.\u00a0 A) was conducted to compare how similarly the distinct ROIs and networks of interest represented psychological characteristics of the musical stimuli, such as their novelty (well-known vs. novel stimuli), their selection (self- vs other-selected), and their liking and familiarity ratings, before and after intervention. Permutation testing comparisons of model RDMs to first-level fMRI-derived RDMs (Fig.\u00a0 B) indicated a significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05, T-max corrected) representation of novelty in the auditory network pre-intervention, but not post-intervention. In addition, there was significant representation of novelty in the left and right anterior and posterior STG, as well as representation of stimulus selection in the right posterior STG, and representation of liking in the anterior salience network at pre-intervention. Post-intervention, there were significant representations of stimulus selection in the left and right anterior and posterior STG and the basal ganglia, significant representations of novelty in bilateral posterior STG and left anterior STG, and significant representations of familiarity in both the basal ganglia and the language networks. Comparing pre-intervention and post-intervention fMRI-derived RDMs showed a significant effect of session in the representation of stimulus selection in the right executive control network (RECN), with a significant increase in relatedness post-intervention.   \nRepresentational similarity analysis. (  A  ) Schematic of RSA processing pipeline. Participant-specific Ratings and task fMRI data are used to generate first-level representational dissimilarity matrices. First-Level RDMs are then used in 10,000-fold bootstrap resampling comparisons of models to functional RDMs for each participant. Resulting relatedness values are used in 50,000-fold t-max permutation testing (  B  ) to determine significant (yellow) model-brain relationships at pre-intervention and post-intervention, as well as any significant effect of session (p\u2009<\u20090.05). First-Level RDMs are then averaged across participants to generate second-level RDMs, which are used to produce second order multidimensional scaling visualizations of RDM relatedness (  C  ). \n  \n\nMultidimensional scaling visualizations of second-level RDMs (Fig.\u00a0 C) indicate a tight clustering of auditory (green) ROIs at both time points. These regions assort most closely with the model of novelty at both time points, and reward associated regions (pink) show a closer assortment with these regions post-intervention. A close relationship between models of liking, familiarity, and selection was also observed, and this relationship became even closer post-intervention. These models were most highly similar to bilateral SMA and the anterior salience network at pre-intervention, and they were most similar to anterior salience and language networks at post-intervention. Post-intervention representations of dorsal DMN and mPFC were also more closely related to bilateral nucleus accumbens as compared to pre-intervention. Overall, neural representations of musical stimuli were mostly similar before and after intervention, except that the reward network became more similar to the auditory network after intervention (Fig.\u00a0 C), and the RECN showed increased differentiation between self-selected and other-selected stimuli, resulting in higher representational similarity with the stimulus selection model after intervention (Fig.\u00a0 B, right panel). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe present an fMRI study testing the effects of liking, familiarity, and self-selection on older adults. Furthermore, we present the first exploratory longitudinal fMRI results from an ongoing receptive music-based intervention on auditory-reward activity and connectivity in older adults. As predicted, musical excerpts that were self-selected, well-liked, and highly familiar were the most effective at driving the activity of the auditory and reward areas, especially overlapping in regions within the DMN. Functional connectivity of the auditory system and the mPFC increased over the course of the intervention and became more selective for self-selected and well-liked music. These results provide more support for the role of functional connectivity between the sensory and reward systems supporting preference, familiarity, and agency as shown by the effect of self-selection. We also see preliminary evidence for changes in brain connectivity following a music-based intervention; this has implications for the design and implementation of music-based interventions for special populations who have disrupted DMN or reward systems, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and depression, respectively. \n\nBehavioral ratings of familiarity and liking, collected in the scanner before and after MBI, showed no overall difference between pre- and post-intervention liking ratings, but a stimulus-type by time interaction where ratings for self-selected stimuli were rated higher post- than pre-intervention, but well-known and novel stimuli were rated higher pre-intervention than post-intervention. Given that participants were listening to some of the same self-selected music as part of their intervention, this increase in liking could be a result of their increased familiarity due to repeated listening for a majority of the intervention. This similarity between familiarity and liking is broadly consistent with the fMRI data, which show many similar parametric effects between liking and familiarity in the auditory and DMN regions. \n\nUnivariate patterns of brain activity showed engagement of auditory and DMN regions. Both the parametric contrasts of liking and familiarity showed activity in auditory (STG, STS, MTG) and DMN (PCC) regions, with liking also engaging additional DMN regions (mPFC, TPJ/IPL) and familiarity also engaging a cluster in the precentral gyrus. While stimuli that were familiar and well-liked engage both the DMN and the auditory network, self-selected music was most effective at engaging additional DMN regions including the parahippocampal gyrus. This engagement of the DMN could be explained by the retrieval of autobiographical memories associated with the music that participants selected, as mPFC activity has been observed in music-evoked autobiographical memories . These effects of liking and familiarity are largely consistent with previous reports, but this is the first study that parametrically tested different levels of liking and familiarity in the same study. In addition to treating liking and familiarity as continuous variables in a parametric analysis, we also separated them in our pairwise testing of auditory and reward connectivity, confirming significantly above-chance levels of functional connectivity within and between auditory and reward networks. \n\nThe effect of familiarity on mental representations of music has been shown on activity of the auditory network identified here , with effects on emotion  and mental representation of music . While we did observe precentral gyrus engagement for familiarity, we did not observe significant activity in other auditory-motor regions, including the SMA. Precentral gyrus activity was only present for familiarity, but not for liking. This may suggest a motor engagement predictability that comes from the recognition of familiar musical elements, as has been shown from prior fMRI studies that involved listening to well-learned music . Activity in auditory areas may reflect that the auditory system was able to form stronger predictions for familiar music than for unfamiliar music . The DMN activity may reflect mind-wandering, or stimulus-independent thought , including autobiographical memory and associations that may be elicited by music that is well-known to the listener. \n\nComparing the effects of liking against effects of familiarity, the TPJ/IPL and mPFC are two regions that were active for liking but not for familiarity. This distinction between liking and familiarity is important: the mPFC is part of both the DMN and the reward system, and it is consistently active during pleasurable experiences including but not limited to music . Our results are consistent with Pereira et al. , who also demonstrated frontal pole/mPFC activity for liked but not for familiar musical stimuli. The fact that it is active during the liking contrast and not the familiarity contrast, adds further support to mounting evidence that the mPFC has a unique role within the DMN, as a region that is common to the DMN and the dopaminergic system. \n\nIn addition to being part of the DMN , the TPJ and the mPFC have together been posited as a theory-of-mind network . The TPJ/IPL is active during theory of mind tasks . This role of TPJ/IPL in thinking about other minds fits well with the idea that musical experiences are fundamentally intertwined with the listener\u2019s understanding of the intentions of the composer and the performer. It has been posited that \u201cthe best music\u201d should have rich structure that can be inferred from its surface, and that the subjective value of music arises from an alliance between \u201ccompositional grammar\u201d and the listener\u2019s \u201clistening grammar\u201d . While the relationship between the meaning of music and its subjective value is complex and abstract, the role of a theory-of-mind network may add to the claim that comprehensibility\u2014here, the understanding of other minds\u2014is necessary if not sufficient for subjective value in music. Here, we see that while the TPJ/IPL and mPFC responded selectively to well-liked music, they showed even greater activity in the self-selected vs. other-selected contrast. The fact that self-selected music was more effective at engaging the theory-of-mind network, compared to music that was retroactively rated as well-liked, again points to a role of agency in determining the subjective value of music. \n\nA strength of the present study is that we obtained fMRI data using a fast TR with many different kinds of musical stimuli, including some that were self-selected by the participant, and others selected by the researcher to span well-known musical selections as well as novel stimuli. The quality and quantity of data enabled more time-sensitive analyses of specific ROI data, including RSA to capture the relative distance between specific ROIs and functional networks, and between ROIs and experimentally-defined variables such as liking, familiarity, novelty, and self-selection. RSA confirmed that liking and familiarity for music are very similarly represented in the brain, and that both are strongly predicted by agency, or the effect of self-selection. Interestingly, the variables of liking, familiarity, and self-selection were more closely represented post-intervention than pre-intervention. Another important observation from RSA is that the reward network became more similar (closer in the MDS plot) to the auditory network after intervention. Novelty was represented differently from liking, familiarity, and self-selection. Relatedly, the RECN was the only network that showed a significant change in representation of stimulus features, specifically of the feature of selection. This is reflected in the increased dissimilarity in the RECN\u2019s representation of the self-selected and novel stimuli post-intervention (Supplementary Materials Fig.  ). In other words, the RECN was more representative of stimulus selection after intervention, in contrast to other networks such as the DMN. This pattern of increased dissimilarity between RECN and DMN that emerged after intervention converges with the well-replicated finding of anticorrelated activity between DMN and RECN at rest and during most cognitive tasks . \n\nSeed-based connectivity showed an increase in functional connectivity from auditory regions to mPFC after intervention. This increase in connectivity is modulated by liking and familiarity, as well as by self-selection. This is borne out by between-participants correlations as well as within-participants beta time-series comparisons: Highest auditory-mPFC connectivity was observed across participants during liked and loved stimuli, especially after intervention. The beta time-series data showed an increasing differentiation by liking, familiarity, and self-selection after the intervention. In contrast, stimuli that were chosen to be well-known to the participants did not differ from novel stimuli in auditory-mPFC functional connectivity. Thus, the music-based intervention increased auditory-reward connectivity, but especially for some individuals and for some listening conditions. This is an important finding, as it is the first longitudinal demonstration of change in auditory-mPFC connectivity. Auditory-reward connectivity has been shown previously during the experience of pleasure when listening to music in task fMRI, PET, resting state fcMRI, and white matter connectivity as identified by DTI . Auditory-reward connectivity has also been modulated pharmacologically  and with transcranial magnetic brain stimulation . However, this is the first study to show a natural (i.e. as opposed to experimentally-induced) longitudinal change in auditory-reward connectivity after a receptive music-based intervention. By mindfully listening to music over the course of weeks, we have shown that participants can change their auditory-reward connectivity. As the reward system is important for many kinds of motivated behavior, these results have profound implications for the design of lifestyle interventions, such as music listening, which may affect motivated behavior through its underlying brain mechanisms. \n\nThe mPFC is a crucial hub across multiple networks in the brain, due to its membership in the dopaminergic reward network, in the DMN, and in coding for subjective value and a sense of ownership or self-referential processing . Rather than disentangling between these theoretical contributions to mPFC activity, the finding that music selectively engages mPFC may highlight the role that music has in all of these psychological functions. Our findings support the idea that music provides an auditory channel towards reward centers including the mPFC. This auditory channel towards the reward system is posited to be the evolutionary basis for the role of music for social bonding . \n\nFrom a clinical standpoint, the mPFC and PCC are most sensitive to changes in functional connectivity in Alzheimer\u2019s disease . mPFC activity and connectivity are also disrupted in psychiatric diseases, including depression and schizophrenia . Thus, these results suggest that MBI may help those with depression and AD, and possibly those with neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases more generally, by mitigating aberrant network changes through modifying activity and connectivity of the mPFC. While these results suggest that MBI is effective in changing auditory-reward connectivity, one caveat is that the present longitudinal study is not a randomized controlled trial; thus the results could be explained by time-dependent changes that are extraneous to music listening. However, given that the older adult population sampled here is unlikely to have spontaneously increasing brain connectivity in these areas without a focused intervention, and given that auditory-reward connectivity is a relatively well-established set of regional hypotheses from previous research , we expect that the observed changes here point to the longitudinal effects of music listening. Nevertheless, the next phase of this study will include a auditory but non-musical control intervention to help isolate the roles of specific musical features on changes in auditory-reward activity and connectivity. \n\nThis study aims to provide a preliminary look at the effects of an MBI on older adults. Though the sample size for this study (N\u2009=\u200916) is relatively small at this point, these results offer a promising direction for research on MBIs and their effect on the aging brain. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted recruitment for this study, limiting trajectory of our recruitment goals and the participants who felt comfortable coming into the lab. Future directions of this study will continue to build on the promising results reported here. \n\nMore generally, the findings of this study suggest that participants should choose the music to be applied in a given intervention or music therapy treatment program, in order to leverage the effects of agency on engagement of brain functions. Allowing individuals to self-select music will also necessitate collaborations between neuroscientists and music therapists to implement MBIs in ways that respect the cultural dependence and personal salience of musical experiences . By demonstrating the ability of music to engage the connection between auditory and reward systems in healthy older adults, our findings shed light on potential therapeutic effects of music listening on healthy aging. \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9261172, "text_md5": "5bbc194e479d90be221d38b8965c6a27", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 158], "journal": [159, 166], "publication_year": [168, 172], "title": [183, 295], "keywords": [309, 371], "abstract": [384, 2003], "body": [2012, 55664]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 35798784, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-15687-5", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9261172", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9261172"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9261172\">9261172</a>", "list_title": "PMC9261172  Longitudinal changes in auditory and reward systems following receptive music-based intervention in older adults"}

We found that increased BOLD activity during the successful reappraisal of positive and negative emotional stimuli was associated with dietary self-control success. This cross-task correlation was present in medial and lateral prefrontal cortex as well as the striatum. In contrast, BOLD activity during the food choice task was not associated with self-reported emotion regulation efficacy. These results suggest that neural processes utilized during the reappraisal of emotional stimuli may also facilitate dietary choices that override palatability in favor of healthfulness. In summary, our findings indicate that the neural systems supporting emotion reappraisal can generalize to other behavioral contexts that require reevaluation of rewarding stimuli and outcomes to promote choices that conform with the current goal. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCognitive strategies and, more recently, the neural mechanisms used to regulate thoughts and actions have been intensely studied in many scientific disciplines. These studies have examined numerous forms of self-regulation, but one prominent strategy is the reappraisal of stimuli encountered in the world ( ;  ;  ). Pioneering studies by Mischel and colleagues ( ;  ;  ;  ) revealed that presenting tempting stimuli as less approachable (e.g. asking participants to imagine food stimuli as abstract pictures) increased the ability to delay gratification (see also  ). Thus, actively reconstructing and reconsidering situations or experiences may enhance control over one\u2019s desires and emotions ( ;  ). Converging evidence shows that reappraising stimuli decreases cravings for immediate rewards such as drugs or food when stimuli related to these rewards are viewed ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Reappraisal appears to be a highly relevant self-regulatory skill. Although ample evidence shows that individuals can dampen their cravings by reappraising food stimuli and recent studies show that training to reappraise food stimuli ( ) translates into healthier food choices when participants are asked to decide what to eat at the end of the study or right after applying reappraisal strategies on each trial ( ;  ), it remains unclear whether such regulation skills generalize between task types. For example, does the ability to reappraise emotional stimuli correlate with self-control in eating behavior? \n\nIt has been argued previously that self-regulation skills are domain-general, but temptations or challenges may be still be domain-specific ( ), potentially requiring very different neural responses. Most of the existing evidence for domain generality or specificity comes from meta-analyses, which either compare different neural candidate mechanisms or broad classes of tasks using between-subjects designs. The degree to which self-regulatory processes in different laboratory tasks and real-life situations share common cognitive and neural substrates is debated ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, it is important to understand whether an individual can engage neural mechanisms of regulation, be they overlapping or distinct, to modulate behavior to the same relative degree in different behavioral domains. For example,  ) found a significant correlation between the regulation of food and altruistic choices, and  ) reported that inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) activity during a go/no go task moderated the relationship between craving and smoking. A recent study by  ) showed that regulation of alcohol cravings and regulation of negative emotion share a common neural substrate in the left inferior frontal gyrus (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, vlPFC). Such questions and predictions can be tested directly using within-subjects designs. Therefore, here we compare self-regulation in the forms of reappraisal of emotion-evoking scenes and health-oriented dietary choices in order to test for associations between these two behaviors. \n\nMeta-analytic evidence suggests that the neural systems supporting the reappraisal of emotions and dietary self-control overlap to some extent ( ). \n\nPrevious work looking at emotion regulation has shown that explicit reappraisal recruits PFC regions including dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC), ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC), ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) and the supplementary motor area (SMA) ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). These regions appear to modulate the reactivity of the insula and dorsal ACC, amygdala and ventral striatum ( ;  ;  ;  ). Similarly, dietary self-control has been reported to involve a set of prefrontal regions including dlPFC, dmPFC, dACC and vmPFC ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ). However, all of these regions have been reported to be involved in a wide range of behaviors beyond self-regulation, and thus it is unclear what, if any, conclusions we can draw from partially overlapping patterns of activity between emotional reappraisal and dietary choice. Thus, it remains an open question what, if any, neural activation patterns might underlie individual differences in self-regulation success across domains. Therefore, it is important that studies directly test whether neural processes underlying self-regulation within one domain are associated with behavioral outcomes in another domain. \n\nIn order to directly compare and contrast neural processing and regulatory success between dietary and emotional self-regulation, we tested the same individuals using both established emotion reappraisal ( ;  ) and dietary self-control tasks ( ). For both tasks, we varied the challenge level across trials such that participants faced trials that ranged from small to large challenges. We hypothesized that if neural activity patterns during the reappraisal of emotional scenes are relevant to or correlated with processes that aid dietary self-control, then individual differences in BOLD activity during successful reappraisal will be associated with success in the dietary self-control task or vice versa. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nForty-three healthy adults (18 men) participated in this study. All participants were German native speakers and maintained a health-oriented lifestyle (including a specific interest in healthy eating) but also enjoyed eating snack foods (e.g. chocolate, cake, cookies, chips or crackers) and did so on at least two occasions per week. We used the Beck Depression Inventory I ( ), the German validated version by  ), and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale ( ), the German validated version by  ), to screen for depression and emotion blindness because both conditions have been associated with altered emotion perception. All participants provided written informed consent at the day of the experiment according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study was conducted in accordance with the regulations of the Ethics Committee of the Canton of Zurich. \n\nFive participants had to be excluded from dietary self-control analyses: two did not complete this task, for one the experiment could not be constructed with a sufficient number of challenging trials, one did not comply with the instructions, and one never chose to eat during the self-control challenge trials. This left a sample of 17 men (mean age\u2009=\u200922.47\u2009\u00b1\u20092.27 standard deviation [SD] years; BMI mean\u2009=\u200922.76\u2009\u00b1\u20092.34 SD) and 21 women (mean age\u2009=\u200921.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.09 SD years; BMI mean\u2009=\u200921.10\u2009\u00b1\u20092.25 SD) for the behavioral analyses of dietary choices. One additional participant had to be excluded from the fMRI dietary choice analyses for excessive head motion, but this dataset was included in the behavioral analyses. Seven participants were excluded from reappraisal analyses: five fell asleep during a substantial portion of the task (detected by the eye-tracker), one deliberately closed the eyes during negative pictures (reported during debriefing), and one reported experiencing discomfort due to head positioning during the task. We reasoned that the participant who was uncomfortable but remained in the scanner without complaint until after the study was engaging in constant self-regulation that would interfere with our analyses. One additional woman was excluded from fMRI analyses for this task due to excessive head motion. This left 35 usable fMRI datasets for the reappraisal task and 37 for the dietary self-control task. In total 31 participants (17 women) completed the reappraisal and dietary self-control tasks and had good fMRI data quality during both. We used a priori criteria that are well established in our lab to make our exclusion decisions. All datasets were excluded before analyzing any behavioral data. For recruiting, we followed the previously published cutoffs of our laboratory for this task ( ; Maier   et\u00a0al  ., in press): only individuals who consumed snack foods at least on two occasions per week on average for the past 4 weeks and had an interest in maintaining a healthy lifestyle took part. We only removed participants based on the observation of the experimenter that a given participant clearly did not follow through on the task (e.g. by falling asleep or closing the eyes deliberately) or was experiencing a condition that precluded measuring the emotion task cleanly (one participant only reported after the scan that he was in pain due to the tight fitting head coil). These observations were recorded in the lab notebook at the time of data collection, and these datasets were excluded from the analyses of the respective task a priori. For the fMRI data, we applied quality checks based on the realignment parameters from the preprocessing. In case motion in the   X  ,   Y   or   Z   direction exceeded 2\u00a0mm or 2\u00b0 tilt, we first tried realigning to another trial. We then accounted with a regressor of non-interest for any times for which there was still a deviation greater than 2\u00a0mm or 2\u00b0 from the reference slice for short periods (see information in the fMRI analysis section on flagged volumes). For one participant, who for the second half of the food choice run had moved more than 3\u00a0mm and 2\u00b0, we excluded the food choice run due to excessive motion before running any further analyses on the food choice data. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nParticipants were reminded by email on the day before to their study appointment that on the study day, they should eat a small meal of ~400 calories 3\u00a0h before their appointment and in the 2.5\u00a0h leading up to the appointment should consume nothing but water. Together with the study inclusion, instruction and behavioral ratings that were first completed in the laboratory session, this ensured a fasting period of 3\u00a0h before the dietary choice task. Initially, a 6-min baseline heartbeat measurement was taken while participants were lying supine in a comfortable position in a quiet room. Participants then rated a set of 180 foods for taste (regardless of healthfulness) and health (regardless of taste) on a generalized visual analog scale with markers in steps of 1 from \u22125 to +5 (with \u22125 being not at all and\u2009+\u20095 being maximally healthy/tasty) or vice versa. The middle of the scale showed a zone that was termed \u2018neutral\u2019 and comprised the area that corresponded to \u22125 and\u2009+5% of the total scale length centered on zero ( ). We randomly determined whether participants would use a rating scale in which the left\u2013right orientation ranged from negative to positive or positive to negative. We ensured that individual participants rated food properties and later feelings using the same directionality. \n  \nBehavioral tasks: Participants rated 180 food stimuli for taste and health using the rating scale depicted in (A). Items rated \u2018neutral\u2019 (falling within \u00b15% of the scale around zero) were not presented in the choice set. The order of rating from \u22125 (\u2018very untasty/unhealthy\u2019) to +5 (\u2018very tasty/healthy\u2019) or vice versa was counterbalanced across participants. In the dietary self-control task (B), participants had to choose what to eat at the end of the study. Stimuli were first presented for 1\u00a0s as a phase-scrambled image before participants had 3\u00a0s to choose whether to eat the food by pressing left or right (yes/no, order counterbalanced). The selected option was framed in white for 0.1\u00a0s. Trials were followed by a jittered 2\u20136-s inter-trial interval. In the emotion regulation task (C), participants were presented with positive, negative and neutral stimuli from the IAPS. In blocks of 20 trials, participants were asked to \u2018view\u2019 the positive and negative images or to \u2018reappraise\u2019 the content such that the elicited feelings got weaker. Neutral images were only presented in the \u2018view\u2019 condition. At the beginning of the block, a short verbal instruction for the block appeared for 1\u00a0s An abbreviated reminder (\u2018V\u2019 for \u2018view\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019 for \u2018reappraise\u2019) was then displayed centered on the stimuli instead of the fixation cross. First a phase-scrambled version of the stimulus was presented for 1\u00a0s together with the cue. Then the image was revealed for 7\u00a0s, in which participants had to try and reappraise the content of the picture in order to regulate their feelings or let their feelings evolve naturally. Participants then had 4\u00a0s to rate their current feeling on a 9-point Self-Assessment-Manikin scale (fourth screen). Participants rated both foods and feelings using the same directionality (counterbalanced; from negative to positive or vice versa). Trials were separated by a jittered 1\u20135\u00a0s inter-trial interval. After each block of reappraising or viewing, participants were given a 15-s break. Note that in this figure, we have replaced the IAPS stimuli by our own photos for display purposes. \n  \nNext, participants received a short practice session to familiarize themselves with the dietary self-control task. At the start, they were reminded to try and choose healthier foods as often as they could, bearing in mind that they would have to eat the item they chose if this trial was drawn to be realized in the end. They made five practice choices to get accustomed to the choice screen. The experimenter then introduced the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scale for rating current emotions according to the procedure detailed in  ) and explained the reappraisal task using a standardized instruction sheet with one example for positive and negative pictures. Participants were instructed to practice downregulating their feelings elicited by both negative and positive pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) by Lang and colleagues. In the view condition, they were instructed to watch the presented image and become aware of the feelings that this image evokes. They should not try to alter these feelings. In the reappraisal condition, participants should watch the image and try to come up with a different story that could explain the scene, such that the evoked feeling becomes weaker. Negative feelings should become less negative, and positive feelings less positive. For example, one could think of the image as a scene or mock-up from a movie: things are not as bad or good as they seem, but just staged. \n\nParticipants then practiced with a computerized version of the task as it was presented in the fMRI scanner, first for two pictures with free timing and then for two pictures with the timing for picture presentation and emotion rating that was applied during the scan. Before going into the scanner, participants rated their current hunger feeling on a visual analog scale with anchors in steps of 1 from \u22125 to +5 (with \u22125 being not at all, and\u2009+5 being maximally hungry) or vice versa. We transformed these values into percentages of maximal hunger feeling. Across the group, the mean hunger rating was 67\u2009\u00b1\u200918% SD. \n\nIn the scanner, participants completed the dietary self-control task and emotion regulation task each in a single run with 100 trials, in counterbalanced order. After the first run, the anatomical scan was collected to allow for a washout period of 7\u00a0min between the tasks. \n\nAfter the MRI scans, participants re-rated all 40 stimuli that had been presented in the reappraisal conditions while sitting at a standard computer terminal. Participants were asked to rate the images as in the \u2018viewing\u2019 condition, i.e. rating the feeling elicited by the image without altering this emotion. \n\nLastly, there was a 30-min waiting period during which one of the food choices was realized for each participant. In case the participant had chosen to eat this food, they were asked to do so within the 30-min waiting period. If they had refused to eat this food, they were asked to stay in the lab for these 30\u00a0min without eating anything else. In case the trial was missed, the computer chose randomly whether the participant would have to eat the food or not, thereby incentivizing participants to deliberately make their choices. Participants were fully informed about these procedures before beginning the study. Participants also filled in a battery of psychometric questionnaires during this waiting period. At the end of the 30\u00a0min, participants were paid a flat fee of 90 CHF for their participation in this 3-h study. \n\n\n### Reappraisal task \n  \nIn the emotion regulation task ( ), before each block of 20 trials, the condition \u2018view\u2019 or \u2018reappraise\u2019 was displayed for 1\u00a0s. All trials for the respective condition were performed in one block, and participants saw each stimulus only once during the fMRI session. Participants first saw a scrambled version of the stimulus image for 1\u00a0s centered on the screen before the stimulus was displayed in the same spot for 7\u00a0s. During this time, participants had to either passively view the image without altering their feelings or reappraise their feeling according to the practiced procedure so that their feelings became weaker. To remind them of the condition to be applied, a shortened cue (\u2018V\u2019 for view or \u2018R\u2019 for \u2018reappraise\u2019) replaced the fixation cross on top of the stimulus. We omitted the letters in the figure for clarity. Participants then had 4\u00a0s to rate their current feeling on a 9-point SAM valence scale. A jittered inter-trial interval (uniformly sampled from 1 to 5\u00a0s) separated one trial from the next. \n\nBlock types (reappraise positive, reappraise negative, view positive, view negative, view neutral) were presented in five different orders that were pseudorandomized across participants. Each block was followed by a 15-s break (with the word \u2018pause\u2019 appearing over a countdown that showed the remaining seconds of break time). \n\nIAPS Stimuli were selected based on a validation study in a German-speaking sample of young adults ( ). Based on the mean ratings given by young adults in this dataset, we identified 40 images that scored highest on positive and 40 images that scored highest on negative valence, skipping any that showed foods and proceeding to the next best scoring images as a replacement. We distributed the positive and negative images each into two sets such that both sets in each domain were equated on average for arousal (mean negative, 6.99\u2009\u00b1\u20090.44; mean positive, 2.86\u2009\u00b1\u20090.43 based on the ratings of the sample in  )). We randomly allocated for each of our participants which set they would see in the \u2018view\u2019 and \u2018reappraise\u2019 condition. We then identified 20 images that scored neutral on both valence and arousal. \n\n\n### Dietary self-control task \n  \nIn the dietary self-control task ( ), participants were shown one food in the center of the screen on each trial and had to indicate within the 3-s response window whether they wanted to eat this food or nothing at the end of the study. Choices were customized based on the input of the participant who, before the food choice task, gave their individual taste and health ratings for a large set of foods. The customized food sets were created such that each participant would face ~75% challenging choices, in which the presented food was either subjectively (i) palatable and unhealthy (i.e. rated above and below the neutral zone on the taste and health rating scales, respectively; see  , yellow zone) or (ii) healthy and unpalatable. In the remaining choices, health and taste were aligned, so the food was rated as palatable and healthy, or unpalatable and unhealthy. Trial types were randomly intermixed, and a jittered inter-trial interval (uniform draw of 2\u20136\u00a0s) separated each trial. \n\n\n### Psychometric inventories \n  \nThe psychometric questionnaire battery included the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire ( ), the German validated version by  )); the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire ( ), the German validated version by  )); PANAS (to describe their mood for the last week ( ), the German validated version by  )); BIS-BAS ( ), the German validated version by  ); BIS-15 ( ), the German validated version of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale ( ) short-form BIS-15 by  ); and NEO-FFI ( ), the German validated version by  )). \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nThe MRI data were recorded using a Philips Achieva 3\u00a0T whole-body scanner with an eight-channel sensitivity encoding head coil (Philips Medical Systems). Stimuli were presented with the Psychophysical Toolbox Software (Psychtoolbox 3.0,  ), RRID:SCR_002881) via back-projection to a mirror mounted on the head coil. \n\nWe acquired gradient echo T2 -weighted echo-planar images (EPIs) with blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast (37 slices per volume, field of view 200 x 132.6 x 200\u00a0mm, slice thickness 3\u00a0mm, 0.6\u00a0mm gap, in-plane resolution 2.5 x 2.5\u00a0mm, matrix 80 x 79, repetition time 2344\u00a0ms, echo time 30\u00a0ms, flip angle 77\u00b0) and a SENSE reduction (i.e. acceleration) factor of 1.5. Volumes were acquired in axial orientation. We collected 354 volumes during the dietary choice run (~12\u00a0min) and 679 volumes during the emotion regulation run (~25\u00a0min). There was one run of data collection for each task. Both runs were collected in ascending order. Before each run, five \u2018dummy\u2019 volumes were collected to allow for stabilization of the magnetic field. A T1-weighted turbo field echo-structural image was acquired in sagittal orientation for each participant between the functional scans (181 slices, field of view 256 x 256 x 181\u00a0mm, slice thickness 1\u00a0mm, no gap, in-plane resolution 1 x 1\u00a0mm, matrix 256 x 256, repetition time 8.3\u00a0ms, echo time 3.89\u00a0ms, flip angle 8\u00b0). To measure the homogeneity of the magnetic field, we collected B0/B1 maps before the first run and before acquiring the structural scan (short echo time\u2009=\u20094.29\u00a0ms, long echo time\u2009=\u20097.4\u00a0ms). We measured breathing frequency and took an electrocardiogram with the in-built system of the scanner in order to correct for physiological noise. \n\n\n### fMRI preprocessing \n  \nFunctional data were spatially realigned and unwarped with statistical parametric mapping software (SPM12, Update Rev. Nr. 6906; Functional Imaging Laboratory, University College London, RRID:SCR_007037), slice-timing corrected, coregistered to the participant\u2019s T1-weighted high-resolution structural image and normalized to the individual mean EPI template before segmenting according to the individual T1 scan and smoothing with an isometric Gaussian kernel (4\u00a0mm full width at half maximum). In order to account for fluctuations in the BOLD signal due to physiological noise, we finally used RETROICOR as implemented in the TAPAS PhysIO toolbox (Version 2015; open source code available as part of the TAPAS software collection:  ) by  ) to model respiration and heartbeat ( ;  ). Following  ), the algorithm implemented in the PhysIO toolbox uses Fourier expansions of different order to estimate the phases of cardiac pulsation (third order), respiration (fourth order) and cardio-respiratory interactions (first order). \n\n\n### Experimental design and statistical analysis \n  \nWe sought to identify whether neural processes occurring during reappraisal were associated with the behavioral outcome of another, distinct self-regulation task: dietary self-control. All correlations reported in this paper were calculated using a Bayesian estimation procedure ( ), where we calculated the Bayesian equivalent of Pearson\u2019s (linear) or Spearman\u2019s (rank) correlation coefficients across all participants. \n\nOur hypothesis was that neural activity during reappraisal would be correlated with dietary self-control success and potentially vice versa. Note, however, that these two relationships are distinct and a relationship in one case does not indicate or require the other. To compare both reappraisal and dietary self-control abilities, we chose a within-subject design. Based on prior reports of these self-regulation tasks in the literature, we expected a moderate effect size ( ). \n\nAll behavioral analyses presented in this paper were performed with the R (\u2018R Core Team,\u2019 2015), version 3.5.1, RRID:SCR_001905, STAN ( ) and JAGS ( ) statistical software packages. For all Bayesian modeling analyses, we used the default, uninformative priors specified by the brms ( ) and BEST ( ,  ) R-packages, which means that our Bayesian analyses would give very similar results to their frequentist analogs. \n\nSPM12 ( ), update 6906) was used to preprocess fMRI data and calculate first-level models. FSL\u2019s randomize tool ( ) was used to run non-parametric permutation tests (  n  \u00a0=\u20095000 permutations) with threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) on the group level. We chose to switch to the implementation in FSL 5 (RRID:SCR_002823) for this analysis, because the TFCE and permutation algorithms were more fully documented and computed faster in FSL compared to SPM12. \n\n\u2013  were created using the MRIcron and MRIcroGL software packages ( ,  , RRID:SCR_002403). Anatomical labels for the tables were derived from the Harvard\u2013Oxford cortical and subcortical atlases ( , RRID:SCR_001476) with FSL\u2019s atlasquery and cluster commands. \n\nIn the main text, we report   T  - and   P  -values for the strongest contiguous cluster in each analysis. Exact   T  -values at the voxel-level can be found in a Neurovault repository (link:  ). For non-significant contrasts, we report the minimum whole-brain corrected   P  -values (or minimum small-volume-corrected   P  -values where indicated). All analysis code and raw data for the behavioral results can be found at  . Raw fMRI data will be accessible after publication on  . \n\nThe mask for small-volume corrections in the left PFC was built from the Harvard\u2013Oxford Cortical Atlas and comprised the frontal pole, inferior frontal gyrus pars operculum and pars triangularis, as well as medial and superior frontal gyrus (14\u2009215 voxels). \n\n\n### Behavioral analyses \n  \n#### Reappraisal task \n  \nIn the emotion paradigm, reappraisal success was measured as the difference between emotion ratings given when reappraising the image inside the scanner and post-scan ratings made when viewing the same picture again without reappraising it as in  ). We calculated success scores for negative-valence stimuli as the difference, reappraisal minus view, because the reappraised rating should be higher (i.e. more positive) than the unregulated viewing rating if reappraisal of negative stimuli was successful. The difference, view minus reappraise, was calculated for positive reappraisal trials, because for positive stimuli, the unregulated view ratings should be higher than the reappraised rating when successfully modulating positive emotions. Our primary measure of reappraisal success, the overall emotion reappraisal success score, was computed across both negative and positive images as the mean of the positive plus negative reappraisal success scores. However, we also computed and checked the reappraisal success scores for each valence separately in some cases noted below. We also checked that positive and negative reappraisal success did not differ significantly (see  ). \n\nTo test whether ratings differed significantly between the conditions, we conducted the following linear regression: \n\n (1) \n\nIn this model,   valence rating   was the rating given on the respective trial, coded from 1 (very sad) to 9 (very happy) in steps of 1, according to the SAM scale, and   condition   was a factor with 5 levels (0\u2009=\u2009neutral view, 1\u2009=\u2009negative view, 2\u2009=\u2009negative reappraisal, 3\u2009=\u2009positive reappraisal, 4\u2009=\u2009positive view). The model included subject-specific random intercepts and slopes for the condition. \n\n\n#### Dietary self-control task \n  \nIn the dietary self-control paradigm, challenging trials were defined as those trials in which health and taste attributes were not aligned. The overall self-control success level was measured as the proportion of all challenging trials in which participants refused to eat a tasty, unhealthy food or accepted eating a healthy, unpalatable food as in  ). We tailored each participant\u2019s food choice set such that she/he would face ~75 self-control challenges (in which health and taste were not aligned) out of 100 decisions. To classify these challenges, we used the individual health and taste ratings that each participant had given previously on this day for the foods. The number and types of challenges we could present each individual depended on their ratings for the full set of 180 foods. Most participants faced more self-control challenges for items that were unhealthy and tasty (out of 100 choices: minimum 14, median 52.5, maximum 77) than challenges including healthy but unpalatable items (minimum 0, median 15, maximum 46). \n\nTo characterize dietary choice patterns, we modeled participant\u2019s choices of the healthier item as a function of taste and health properties with a Bayesian mixed logistic regression model (equation 2): \n\n (2) \n\nIn this model,   Yes   was a binary indicator for choices taking the value 1 when the participant chose to eat the presented item and 0 otherwise, and   taste   and   health   denoted the respective ratings for the item depicted on the screen that were standardized and mean-centered across all participants. The model included subject-specific random intercepts and subject-specific random slopes for the   taste   and   health   attributes  ,   allowing both variables to have differential effects in each participant. To check the robustness of our results, we also included control variables for the main effect of the   order   in which reappraisal and dietary self-control tasks were performed and the interactions of task order and taste and health attributes, as well as the main effects of   hunger   level (in percent, indicated on a visual analog scale from 0, not at all, to 100, maximally hungry),   gender   (male/female, self-reported),   body mass index (BMI)   and   restrained eating score (RE)   on the restraint subscale of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire ( ). Task order and gender were modeled as factors, and standardized scores were used for eating restraint, BMI and hunger level. We chose to include the restrained eating subscale of the TFEQ based on our prior work ( ), in which we showed that RE explained individual variation in dietary self-control behavior beyond the effects of task features. \n\nTo test for the determinants of self-control in challenging trials, in which health and taste aspects were not aligned, we modeled self-control success as a function of taste, health and challenge type: \n\n (3) \n\nwhere   SCS   was a binary variable taking the value of 1 if participants succeeded on this trial and 0 if they did not,   Taste   and   Health   described the within-participant   z  -scored taste and health ratings for the depicted food, and   LTHH   was a factor with two levels (coded as 1 if participants saw a low-taste/high-health food on this trial and 0 otherwise, i.e. using high-taste/low-health challenges as reference). The model included subject-specific random intercepts and subject-specific random slopes for taste, health, challenge type and their interactions. \n\nTo test for reaction time (RT) differences as a function of trial type, we fit the model described in Eq. 4: \n\n (4) \n\nwhere log(  rt  ) was the log-transformed RT for food choices on each trial,   Yes   was a binary indicator for the choice made, equaling 1 if the participant chose to eat the item on the screen and 0 otherwise, and   Type   was a factor with three levels indicating the type of trial (0\u2009=\u2009no challenge trials, 1\u2009=\u2009challenge trials with high-taste/low-health (HTLH) foods and 2\u2009=\u2009challenge trials with low-taste/high-health (LTHH) foods). The variable   Stakes   was calculated for each trial as described in equation (5), and the variable   Difficulty   was calculated for each trial as described in equation (6). The model included subject-specific random intercepts and subject-specific random slopes for answer, trial type and their interaction and for the self-control stakes and difficulty. \n\nInspecting the results of fMRI model GLM-SCS (described below) prompted us to investigate more carefully how individuals solved self-control challenges. To this end, we performed an exploratory analysis to investigate how participants tracked the objective challenge and importance of self-control choices. We constructed a measure we call the self-control   stakes   (see  , upper left and lower right quadrant). The stakes variable is a combination of the absolute magnitudes of two food attributes: one is the taste of the food, which determines how much taste temptation participants have to resist or how much aversion they have to overcome in order to eat an unpalatable item. The other, separate aspect is the health benefit or cost they accrue in doing so. The stakes are high both when a very tasty temptation carries with it large health drawbacks (upper left quadrant) and when a highly unpalatable food would yield high health benefits (lower right quadrant). By definition, self-control is only required when the taste and healthiness attributes are in opposition, and, therefore, the stakes are zero throughout both the lower left and upper right quadrants. In our analyses, we compute what is at stake in each self-control challenge trial by adding up the absolute value (i.e. the distance from zero, which is in our case equals neutral on the rating scale) of the taste (tr) and health (hr) aspects for all foods in the upper left or lower right quadrants of  , according to equation 5: \n\n (5) \n\nNote that this measure is different from subjective difficulty or decision conflict, which increases the closer weighted taste and health values are to zero ( ). We calculated the subjective difficulty or decision conflict on each trial according to equation 6: \n\n (6) \n\nWe also sought to estimate the weights on taste and health ratings that capture the subjective importance of taste and health aspects to the decision-maker for use in our fMRI analyses. We estimated these weights using the logistic regression model described in equation 7 that was calculated for each participant: \n\n (7) \n\nSimilar to the model in equation 2,   Yes   was a binary indicator for choices taking the value 1 when the participant chose to eat the presented item and 0 otherwise, and   taste   and   health   denoted the respective ratings for the item depicted on the screen that were mean-centered before entering the regression. \n\n\n\n### fMRI analyses \n  \n#### General linear models \n  \nAll fMRI models included nuisance regressors for head motion and cardiac and respiratory effects on each trial. Additionally, in case motion exceeded 2\u00a0mm or 2\u00b0 tilt, a binary regressor flagged this trial, the three preceding trials and one subsequent trial to account for any variance associated with the excessive motion. In total, 12 out of 35 included emotion reappraisal datasets contained flagged volumes (mean\u2009=\u20093.7%, range\u2009=\u2009[0.7%; 14.1%] of all acquired volumes), and 2 out of 37 included dietary choice datasets (mean\u2009=\u20097.2%, range\u2009=\u2009[1.4%; 13%]). \n\nIn the model of the reappraisal task, onsets for the cue and reappraisal/view screens were modeled as boxcar functions with a duration equaling the cue depiction and task periods (1 and 7\u00a0s), and rating periods were modeled as boxcar functions with durations equaling the RT for the rating. In the fMRI models of the dietary self-control task, regressors were defined as boxcar functions with durations equaling the RT on each trial. \n\n\n#### Correction for multiple testing \n  \nWe conducted two analyses examining associations between BOLD activity and performance across tasks. Therefore, we applied a Bonferroni correction to the results resulting in a significance threshold of   P  \u00a0<\u20090.025 for our whole-brain analysis. We also conducted a region of interest (ROI) analysis in five regions that have previously been found to be involved in reappraisal processes as well as decision-making (amygdala, dlPFC, hippocampus, striatum, vmPFC) to test whether activity change there in reappraisal success compared to viewing stimuli related to self-control success in the dietary domain. We used a Bonferroni correction to account for testing in five separate regions (resulting significance threshold\u2009=\u00a0  P  \u00a0<\u20090.01). \n\n\n#### Reappraisal task \n  \nOur main general linear model on emotion regulation (GLM-ER) tested for BOLD activity correlated with stimulus reappraisal. GLM-ER modeled events of interest for (1) positive view, (2) positive reappraisal success, (3) positive reappraisal failure, (4) negative view, (5) negative reappraisal success, (6) negative reappraisal failure, (7) neutral view trials, as well as (8) the time during which participants gave their emotion ratings. None of these had any parametric modulators. We calculated a first-level contrast for reappraisal success subtracting BOLD activity during viewing, collapsed over positive and negative modalities. On the group level, we then examined with this contrast whether we detected increases in BOLD activity during reappraisal success compared to viewing and whether these differential increases for each participant correlated with their empirically measured dietary self-control success level. In addition, to test whether BOLD activity differed for the success in negative compared to positive regulation trials, we calculated the contrasts Positive Reappraisal Success > Negative Reappraisal Success and Negative Reappraisal Success > Positive Reappraisal Success on the individual and group level. For comparison purposes and facilitating further meta-analyses, we also calculated the contrasts Positive Reappraisal > Positive View, Negative Reappraisal > Negative View and Reappraisal > View that can be inspected in the NeuroVault collection, but are not further interpreted here. \n\n\n#### Dietary self-control task \n  \nTo assess neural activity during dietary choice, we first calculated GLM-FC (food choice). It modeled events of interest for all trials in which a choice was made. The model included parametric modulators for the subjective food value (linear and quadratic effects), which were orthogonalized. We calculated participant-level and group-level contrasts for the parametric effects of subjective food value. \n\nSubjective food value was calculated as in  ) and  ): we first estimated the logistic regression model specified in equation 7 for each participant to model their food choices as a function of taste and health ratings. We then used these taste and health weights that characterize the subjective importance the participant placed on taste and health aspects to weight taste and health ratings for the food choices on each trial and summed up the weighted taste and health values into an overall subjective food value on each trial. \n\nIn order to track taste and health aspects separately, we next calculated GLM-TH (taste/health). It modeled events of interest for all trials in which a choice was made. The model included parametric modulators for the taste and health ratings (linear effects), which were not orthogonalized. We calculated participant-level and group-level contrasts for the parametric effects of taste and health. \n\nWe calculated a further GLM to test if any brain regions showed differential activity during self-control success   vs   failure (GLM-SCS) and an exploratory GLM to test whether the brain tracked the stakes of engaging self-control from trial to trial (GLM-ST). \n\nGLM-SCS was constructed after  ). It modeled events of interest for (1) self-control success, (2) self-control failure, (3) trials without a self-control challenge and (4) missed trials. None of these regressors had parametric modulators. Following the analysis of Hare and colleagues, we calculated a second-level correlation of the individual overall self-control success levels with the Self-control Success > No Challenge contrast to track individual differences in the BOLD signal relating to differences in self-control usage. To test for a link with individual differences in emotion reappraisal success, we additionally calculated a correlation of the Self-control Success > No Challenge contrast with the overall emotion reappraisal success score. Lastly, we also calculated the contrast for Self-control Success > Failure on the individual and group levels. \n\nThe exploratory model GLM-ST tests for brain areas correlating with our novel measure of self-control stakes, which should be represented in self-control challenges regardless whether or not participants succeeded in using self-control (see  , upper left and lower right quadrant). To examine our neural data, we used the stakes measure in addition to decision conflict as parametric modulators in GLM-ST. This GLM included onsets for (1) all trials in which participants decided on palatable\u2013unhealthy or unpalatable\u2013healthy items, (2) palatable\u2013healthy or unpalatable\u2013unhealthy foods and (3) missed trials. The \u2018stakes\u2019 modulator was orthogonalized with respect to decision conflict in order to obtain a readout of the unique signal associated with the need for self-control beyond that correlated with decision conflict ( ). The modulator thus explained unique variance associated with the self-control need, adjusted for the variance explained by decision conflict and the variance shared between both. We calculated participant- and group-level contrasts for the stakes parametric modulator in the challenging trials. Note that this model contained also second-order expansions for the parametric modulators in order to control for non-linear effects, but these did not explain any variance, indicating only linear effects were present. \n\nTo validate our novel stakes measure, we also re-analyzed a previously acquired dataset with GLM-ST. For the description of this dataset, please see our prior reports in  ) and  ). GLM-ST was run including all 51 participants. Note that in this replication test, we only included first-order polynomial expansions in the model given that there were no second-order effects in the original test on the current food choice data. \n\n\n#### Links between the neural activities in both tasks \n  \nWe chose to examine the link between the tasks through the Reappraisal Success > View and Self-Control Success > No Challenge contrasts, because these provide a clear interpretation that mechanisms associated with both contrasts also contributed to self-regulation success in both cases. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavior \n  \n#### Behavioral results within each separate task \n  \nWe found that participants were able to both regulate their emotions and use dietary self-control to select healthier foods well within each experimental task, respectively. \n\n\n#### Reappraisal task \n  \nIn the emotion regulation task, we asked participants to either (1) simply view and react naturally or (2) reappraise photographs with different emotional valence. After seeing or reappraising the pictures for 7 s, they rated their current affective state using the SAM scale on which 1 indicated the most negative and 9 the most positive emotional valence ( ). To test whether our paradigm was effective, we estimated a Bayesian linear regression that modeled emotion ratings as a function of block type (see equation 1 and  ). Ratings after reappraising negative content were more positive (mean negative reappraise rating\u2009=\u20094.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090.81 SD, posterior probability of negative regulate being greater than negative view ratings (PP(Negative Regulate > Negative View Ratings))\u2009>\u20090.9999) than after simply viewing negative scenes (mean negative view rating\u2009=\u20092.69\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 SD; PP(Neutral View > Negative View Ratings)\u2009>\u20090.9999). Likewise, emotion ratings after reappraising positive stimuli (mean positive reappraise rating\u2009=\u20095.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9 SD; PP(Positive Regulate < Positive View Ratings)\u2009>\u20090.9999) were lower than after simply viewing positive content (mean positive view rating\u2009=\u20097.09\u2009\u00b1\u20090.67 SD; (PP(Positive View > Neutral View Ratings)\u2009>\u20090.9999)). Thus, participants were successful in regulating their emotional responses to the affective pictures when asked to do so. \n  \nEmotion reappraisal behavior: mean ratings made during the fMRI blocks by each participant. Ratings are aggregated over the negative view, negative regulate (reappraise), neutral view, positive regulate and positive view blocks. Participants successfully reappraised negative images such that their emotions became more positive and positive images such that their emotions became more negative. The black solid line represents the group mean, and the gray box indicates the standard error of the mean. Each dot represents the mean ratings from one participant. \n    \nEmotion ratings by condition \n  \n(A) Mean and SD for the emotion ratings given in each block type. (B) Emotion ratings were modeled in a Bayesian linear regression model (specified in equation 1) as a function of block type, allowing participant-specific random intercepts and participant-specific random slopes. Block type was a factor with five levels (negative view, negative regulate, neutral view, positive regulate, positive view). The results show differences in the ratings with regard to neutral viewing as the baseline condition. The analyses in both (A and B) comprised   N  \u00a0=\u200936 participants. \n  \n\n#### Dietary self-control task \n  \nIn addition to the emotion regulation task, participants also completed a food choice task. The food choice task required subjects to make 100 decisions about whether or not they would eat the food item shown on the screen after the MRI scan. Participants knew that one of these trials would be selected at random and their choice on that trial implemented for real, meaning that they would have to eat the food item or go hungry for an additional 30\u00a0min. In analyzing the food choice behavior, we first examined the entire set of food choices using a mixed-effects logistic regression (see equation 2 and  ). This regression showed that, on average, participants considered both taste and health to a similar degree when choosing whether or not to eat the item shown on the screen (regression coefficient (coef.) taste\u2009=\u20091.47; coef. health\u2009=\u20091.46). Consumption choices did not significantly differ as a function of task order, hunger levels, gender, BMI or restrained eating score (see  ). \n  \nBasic food choice model \n  \nThis table reports the results from the Bayesian logistic regression model specified in equation 2 explaining food choices (i.e. eat/do not eat) by taste and health aspects. Taste and health denoted standardized and mean-centered taste and health ratings for the current food. The model controlled for the following additional variables: task order was a factor controlling for the order in which the dietary choice and emotion reappraisal tasks were completed, which was counterbalanced across participants. The model included the interaction of this factor with the taste and health decision attributes. Male was a factor accounting for self-reported gender. Hunger level denoted the standardized and mean-centered hunger level that participants indicated before completing the food choice task. BMI was the standardized and mean-centered BMI. Restrained eating denoted the standardized score on the restrained eating sub-scale of the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire. The regression included participant-specific intercepts and participant-specific random slopes for the taste and health ratings and their interaction with the factor task order. The coefficients (beta estimates) listed are the means of the population level posterior distributions \u00b1 SD and the 95% highest density interval. The analysis comprised   N  \u00a0=\u200938 participants. \n  \nNext, we focused specifically on food choices that represented a self-control challenge. These were trials in which the food was either palatable, but unhealthy, or healthy, but unpalatable according to the participants\u2019 subjective ratings for healthiness and tastiness. Participants faced a self-control challenge on ~75 out of the 100 trials. The mean dietary self-control success level across all participants was 62\u2009\u00b1\u200927 SD %. This indicates that self-control success levels were high on average, but also that there was substantial variability across participants in dietary self-control. We also found that self-control success was achieved more often by refusing to eat tasty\u2013unhealthy foods ( ). The mean self-control success level for refusing the tasty\u2013unhealthy foods was 77% in our sample, whereas the mean success level for accepting unpalatable\u2013healthy foods was only 19%. \n  \nDietary choice behavior: (A) The proportion of \u2018Yes\u2019 responses by choice category. (B) The mean RTs over all participants for accepting and rejecting to eat foods from each of the four categories. In both panels, the black solid line represents the group mean, and the gray box indicates the standard error of the mean. Each dot represents the proportion of \u2018Yes\u2019 choices (A) or mean RT by choice (B) for one participant. \n  \nTo test the influences of taste and health attributes and challenge type on self-control success, we performed a second mixed-effects logistic regression (equation 3 and  ). Overall, the log odds of self-control success were lower for unpalatable\u2013healthy foods (coef. = \u22121.89) compared to tasty\u2013unhealthy foods. For tasty\u2013unhealthy food, higher taste decreased the log odds of success (coef. = \u22121.40). Higher health ratings of the tasty\u2013unhealthy foods also decreased the chances of refusing to eat them (coef. = \u22122.75), perhaps because choosing such a food with relatively higher healthiness might be perceived as a less serious failure. These results suggest that participants were not just habitually refusing tasty\u2013unhealthy foods, because their choices were sensitive to both taste and health aspects in this type of challenge. For healthy\u2013unpalatable food, relatively less bad-tasting foods increased the log odds of success (coef. = 2.67). However, healthiness had little influence on choice during healthy\u2013unpalatable trials. Note that the total effect is equal to the type x health interaction coefficient (2.69) added to the baseline coefficient (\u22122.75). In other words, the significant influence of healthiness during unhealthy\u2013palatable trials, which serve as the baseline in our regression, disappears (2.69\u2009+\u2009\u22122.75\u2009=\u2009\u22120.06) in healthy\u2013unpalatable self-control challenges. The reduced influence of healthiness on these trials may be because the alternative of eating nothing at all for an extra 30\u00a0min is not viewed as an unhealthy outcome. \n  \nSelf-control success by taste and health attributes and challenge type \n  \nThis table reports the results from the Bayesian logistic regression model specified in equation 3 explaining dietary self-control success (coded as a binary variable, 1\u2009=\u2009success/0\u2009=\u2009no success) by taste and health aspects as well as challenge type. Taste and Health denoted between-participant standardized and mean-centered taste and health ratings for the current food. Type was a factor accounting for the type of challenge (levels, 0\u2009=\u2009high-taste/low-health, 1\u2009=\u2009high-health/low-taste). The model included the interaction of this factor with the taste and health decision attributes. The regression included participant-specific intercepts and participant-specific random slopes for the taste and health ratings and their interaction with the challenge type. The coefficients (beta estimates) listed are the means of the population level posterior distributions \u00b1 SD and the 95% highest density interval. The analysis comprised   N  \u00a0=\u200938 participants. \n  \nWe also examined RTs for trials including healthy\u2013unpalatable and palatable\u2013unhealthy foods as well as trials in which taste and health attributes were aligned ( ). Notably, participants were faster to refuse eating the foods for all trial types, except when foods were both high in taste and health attributes (i.e. obvious eat decisions; see  , equation 4 and  ). These RT results suggest that participants may have developed a bias toward refusing to eat the foods in this task. This can be seen in  : the non-challenging trials (in which health and taste aspects were aligned) served as the baseline for this model. In these trials (~25%), which were mostly high-taste/high-health foods, participants were significantly faster when they accepted to eat a food. Here, \u2018Yes/Eat\u2019 responses are fast because the positive values of taste and healthiness quickly overcome the bias toward refusing the items (coef. = \u22120.07). In contrast, for both the high-taste/low-health (HTLH) and low-taste/high-health (LTHH) challenge trials (~75% of all trials), participants were faster when they refused to eat the food compared to when they chose to eat it. This is consistent with an initial bias to refuse eating those conflicted foods and overriding it requiring more time. Such a bias is potentially strategic for self-control because participants most often saw tasty\u2013unhealthy foods in this task and, therefore, may have prepared in advance to decline eating them. \n  \nReaction time model for food choices \n  \nThis table reports the results from the Bayesian regression model of RTs for food choices specified in equation (4). RTs were transformed using the natural logarithm. The variable Yes was coded with a value of 1 if participants chose to eat the depicted item and 0 otherwise. Trial type was coded as a factor with three categories (non-challenging high-taste/high-health (HTHH) and low-taste/low-health (LTLH) trials as the reference category, and high-taste/low-health (HTLH) trials and low-taste/high-health (LTHH) trials as indicator variables). The variable stakes was calculated for each trial as described in equation (5) and the variable difficulty was calculated for each trial as described in equation (6). The regression included participant-specific intercepts and participant-specific random slopes for all regressors and interaction terms. The coefficients (beta estimates) listed are the means of the population level posterior distributions \u00b1 SD and the 95% highest density interval. The analysis comprised   N  \u00a0=\u200938 participants. \n  \nFurther corroboration for the existence of this initial bias comes from drift\u2013diffusion modeling results that show that in the current study, participants have a starting-point bias (~1/3) toward refusing the foods across all trials (see Supplementary Methods, Results, and Table S2). Response times generated using this starting-point bias and the other best fitting DDM parameters (Supplementary Figure S2) reproduce the RT pattern seen in  . Specifically, the Yes/Eat decisions are slower than No/Don\u2019t eat decisions in all cases, except when Yes is the obvious decision because both palatability and healthiness are high. \n\nNotably, the RT patterns for the low-taste/high-health foods speak against a default strategy of choosing healthy: pondering whether to eat the food or not in such choices slowed down participants substantially (coef. = 0.26). If the participants just followed an often-practiced health habit from their daily life, this should not be the case. If they followed such a habit, then choosing healthy foods should come to them naturally and quickly. The slowdown suggests participants perceived a challenge and/or had to overcome a bias to refuse eating the foods. Thus, the overall pattern of results is consistent with the idea that participants may have formed a bias to refuse eating the foods. \n\n\n#### Testing behavioral associations between tasks \n  \nNext, in order to address our questions about the potential link between emotional reappraisal and dietary self-control at the behavioral level, we tested for an association between the self-reported reappraisal and dietary self-control success scores. However, we did not observe a significant correlation between overall dietary self-control success level and emotional reappraisal success (Bayesian rank correlation rho\u2009=\u2009\u22120.023, 95% highest density interval (HDI)\u2009=\u2009[\u22120.368; 0.306], posterior probability of rho greater than zero (PP rho >0)\u2009=\u20090.450). For completeness, we also ran separate tests for reappraisal success in the positive (rho\u2009=\u20090.136, 95% HDI\u2009=\u2009[\u22120.199; 0.472], (PP rho >0)\u2009=\u20090.781) and negative-valence domains (rho\u2009=\u2009\u22120.175, 95% HDI\u2009=\u2009[\u22120.499; 0.156], (PP rho >0)\u2009=\u20090.159), but these did not show significant correlations with the overall dietary self-control success level either. \n\n\n\n### fMRI \n  \n#### Testing for previously observed patterns of BOLD activity within each task \n  \nBefore testing for associations between dietary self-control and emotion regulation at the neural level, we first checked if the patterns of neural activity within each paradigm were consistent with previous findings from emotion reappraisal and dietary choice studies. \n\n\n#### Reappraisal task \n  \nOur findings from the reappraisal paradigm were consistent with past fMRI studies examining the neural correlates of reappraising emotional scenes. The contrast of Reappraisal Success > View across both positive and negative valence showed several regions noted in previous work ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) such as the medial temporal gyrus, SMA, caudate, putamen, insula, vlPFC and dlPFC were more active when reappraising emotional scenes compared to viewing them and reacting naturally (GLM-ER;  ,  ). Note that the contrasts Reappraisal Success > View and Reappraisal > View were very similar in this sample. This is not surprising because participants rarely failed to reappraise the image content (see Supplementary Figure S3 and Table S3). In line with the behavioral finding that participants succeeded in reappraising both valences, positive and negative emotion reappraisal success did not significantly differ in terms of BOLD activity (Negative Reappraisal Success > Positive Reappraisal Success, all   P  -values >0.28, whole-brain family-wise error corrected; Positive Reappraisal Success > Negative Reappraisal Success, all   P  -values >0.29 whole-brain corrected). \n  \nSuccessfully reappraising > viewing emotional content: collapsed over both positive and negative stimuli, BOLD activity in GLM-ER was greater in a widespread set of brain regions when successfully reappraising the content of emotional pictures in order to dampen the elicited emotions, compared to viewing the stimuli without altering the elicited feeling (  P  \u00a0<\u20090.05, whole-brain corrected, derived from 5000 permutations of the data). The heat map represents T-statistics on a scale from 0 to 8 to keep the scale consistent across all subsequent figures. \n    \nReappraisal success > view in GLM-ER \n  \nThe contrast reappraisal success > view was collapsed across both positive and negative valence in order to test for domain-general regulation mechanisms. All reported regions were significant at   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05 after the whole-brain family-wise error correction. TFCE test statistics and their null distribution (5000 permutations) were calculated with the randomize package in FSL. Anatomical labels were derived from the Harvard\u2013Oxford cortical and subcortical atlases. The analysis comprised   N  \u00a0=\u200935 participants. These results are in line with the meta-analysis by  ) on brain regions supporting reappraisal > emotional baseline across 48 studies (their   and  ). For unthresholded T-maps of the contrasts split by valence, please see the Neurovault collection under  . \n  \n\n#### Dietary self-control task \n  \nIn the food choice task, some of our analyses were consistent with previous reports, but in other cases, there were notable differences. Using GLM-FC, we found BOLD activity scaling with subjective food value in a set of brain regions typically associated with value-based choices during tests of self-control ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and more generally (i.e. without explicit self-control) ( ;  ). These included the medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices ( ,  ;   P  \u00a0=\u20090.01, whole-brain corrected). A separate GLM (GLM-TH) that replaced the subjective food values with the individual taste and healthiness ratings showed that overlapping regions also represented healthiness ( ,  ;   P  \u00a0<\u20090.0001) and tastiness ( ,  ;   P  \u00a0=\u20090.02) attributes.   depicts the overlap between the regions that significantly encoded subjective food value, taste and health (conjunction threshold\u2009=\u00a0  P  \u00a0<\u20090.05, whole-brain corrected for family-wise error). \n  \nNeural activity at the time of food choice: (A) BOLD activity increased with higher subjective food value in a set of regions associated with value-based choice in GLM-FV. (B) Depicts regions that increased their BOLD activity with higher health ratings and (C) regions that increased their activity with higher taste ratings of the presented foods (both from GLM-TH). All results in (A to C) were significant at the threshold of   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05, whole-brain corrected. The heat map represents T-statistics derived from 5000 permutations of the data. (D) Depicts in pink the overlap of areas that significantly encoded the three-way conjunction of subjective food value, taste and health attributes. The conjunction threshold was   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05, whole-brain corrected for family-wise error. \n    \nSubjective food value representations in GLM-FV \n  \nAll reported regions were significant at   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05 after whole-brain family-wise error correction. TFCE test statistics and their null distribution (5000 permutations) were calculated with the randomize package in FSL. Anatomical labels were derived from the Harvard\u2013Oxford cortical and subcortical atlases. The analysis comprised   N  \u00a0=\u200937 participants. \n    \nHealth value representations in GLM-TH \n  \nThis table lists regions significantly correlated with the parametric modulator for health ratings in GLM-TH. All reported regions were significant at   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05 after whole-brain family-wise error correction. TFCE test statistics and their null distribution (5000 permutations) were calculated with the randomize package in FSL. Anatomical labels were derived from the Harvard\u2013Oxford cortical and subcortical atlases. The analysis comprised   N  \u00a0=\u200937 participants. \n    \nTaste value representations in GLM-TH \n  \nThis table lists regions significantly correlated with the parametric modulator for taste ratings in GLM-TH. All reported regions were significant at   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05 after whole-brain family-wise error correction. TFCE test statistics and their null distribution (5000 permutations) were calculated with the randomize package in FSL. Anatomical labels were derived from the Harvard\u2013Oxford cortical and subcortical atlases. The analysis comprised   N  \u00a0=\u200937 participants. \n  \nPrevious studies have reported that self-control success is associated with greater activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal and occipital cortex ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, in the current dataset, we did not find in GLM-SCS greater activity in the dlPFC or any other brain regions, on successful self-control trials compared to self-control failures (all   P  -values >0.21, whole-brain corrected; all   P  \u00a0>\u20090.65 small-volume corrected in left lateral PFC). Similarly, the contrast for Self-control Success > No Challenge yielded no significant difference in the PFC (all   P  -values >0.37, whole-brain corrected; all   P  \u00a0>\u20090.77, small-volume corrected in left lateral PFC). Individual differences in the overall dietary self-control success level did not correlate with activity in any prefrontal regions, but we did find that greater activity within the left lingual and fusiform gyri ( ;   P  \u00a0=\u20090.01, whole-brain corrected) during Self-control Success vs. No-Challenge trials was positively correlated with the individual overall dietary self-control success levels. These results linking self-control to activity in regions involved in visual and object processing are consistent with both the speculations about early filtering of visual attention as a mechanism to facilitate self-control in  ) and the pattern of fast refusals for unhealthy foods observed in the current participants\u2019 behavior. \n  \nCorrelation of individual differences in overall dietary self-control success level with the self-control success > no challenge contrast from GLM-SCS \n  \nThe reported region was significant at   P  \u00a0=\u20090.01 after whole brain family-wise error correction. TFCE test statistics and their null distribution (5000 permutations) were calculated with the randomize package in FSL. Anatomical labels were derived from the Harvard\u2013Oxford cortical and subcortical atlases. The analysis comprised   N  \u00a0=\u200937 participants. \n  \n\n#### BOLD activity during emotion reappraisal is associated with dietary self-control success \n  \nNext, we tested the hypotheses that neural activity patterns during successful reappraisal would be related to individual differences in dietary self-control success or vice versa. We computed a between-subjects regression relating individual differences in overall dietary self-control success levels to voxel-wise differences in the Reappraisal Success > View contrast. This analysis revealed that participants whose BOLD signal changed more strongly when successfully reappraising compared to viewing emotional content were also overall better at dietary self-control ( ,  ;   P  \u00a0<\u20090.025 whole-brain corrected). We observe this correlation in areas that represent the value assigned to foods during the food choice task ( ). These food values are based on the relative importance of the palatability and health attributes of the foods and are closely associated with the decision to eat or forego the food on every trial (see  ). Thus, the areas, in which activity during the emotion regulation task is linked to a participant\u2019s average level of dietary self-control, also correlate with trial-wise value computations that support dietary decisions in the food choice task itself. \n  \nEmotion reappraisal and dietary self-control link: (A) the results from a between-subjects regression relating individual differences in the overall dietary self-control success level to voxel-wise differences in BOLD activity during emotion regulation. Activation when successfully reappraising compared to viewing emotional content (GLM-ER) was higher in participants with better dietary self-control (  P  \u00a0<\u20090.025, whole-brain corrected, T-statistics derived from 5000 permutations of the data). This suggests that participants whose neural activity changed more strongly during reappraisal of positive and negative stimuli were also the ones who were better at modulating their dietary decisions to refuse eating tasty\u2013unhealthy foods or increase eating healthy\u2013untasty foods. (B) The conjunction of the contrasts \u2018subjective food value\u2019 from GLM-FV (panel [A] in  ) and the between-subjects regression contrast from GLM-ER (panel [A] in  ). The overlap suggests that regions in the medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices may be involved in modifying the subjective valuation of emotional stimuli and the computation of subjective food values that factor in both health and taste attributes. The scatter plots in (C) illustrate the strength of the relationship between emotion reappraisal and dietary self-control success shown in (A). We performed ROI analyses in five regions that have previously been associated with reappraisal and decision-making in order to assess how strongly the BOLD activity change in reappraisal > view conditions was related to the overall dietary self-control success level. The statistics in each plot give Pearson\u2019s rho (r) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) as well as the   P  -value (two-sided test) for the correlations between the mean BOLD activity for the contrast reappraisal success > view in each region and the overall dietary self-control success level (in percent). \n    \nReappraisal success > view (in GLM-ER) correlates with overall dietary self-control success levels \n  \nAll reported regions were significant at   P  \u00a0<\u20090.025 after whole brain family-wise error correction. We Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons because two separate analyses were required to obtain this result (assessment of the overall dietary self-control success level and assessment of neural reappraisal correlates). TFCE test statistics and their null distribution (5000 permutations) were calculated with the randomize package in FSL. Anatomical labels were derived from the Harvard\u2013Oxford cortical and subcortical atlases. The analysis comprised   N  \u00a0=\u200931 participants. \n  \nWe additionally conducted a priori ROI analyses in regions that have previously been associated with reappraisal and self-control decisions. We computed Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient between the overall dietary self-control success level and Reappraisal Success > View BOLD activity from the following regions (bilateral, anatomically defined based on the Harvard\u2013Oxford atlas): amygdala, hippocampus, striatum (nucleus accumbens, caudate and putamen) and vmPFC as well as left dlPFC (from the union of voxels associated with self-control in  ) or  )). We identified positive correlations between the contrast of Reappraisal Success > View and the overall dietary self-control success level in vmPFC, hippocampus and striatum (Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons: all   P  -values <0.01; see  ). \n\nThe complementary test for whether BOLD activity differences in the dietary Self-control Success > No Challenge contrast from GLM-SCS were linked to overall emotion reappraisal success scores did not yield a significant correlation in any regions (all   P  -values >0.35 after whole-brain correction). The potential reasons for this asymmetry in the relationship between BOLD activity and regulation success across domains are considered in the Discussion section. \n\n\n#### PFC BOLD signals correlate with dietary self-control stakes \n  \nBoth the unexpected tendency to quickly refuse palatable and unpalatable food items and the lack of a significant relationship between PFC activity and dietary self-control prompted us to conduct additional exploratory analyses on the fMRI data from the food choice task. One question we had was if participants were tracking the healthiness and tastiness attributes at stake on each trial with regard to the need for self-control even though they seemed to have a bias toward declining to eat the food items. Given the previous findings implicating left PFC in dietary self-control cited above, we initially searched there. We found that a measure of the objective self-control stakes (defined as |HR|\u2009+\u2009|TR| on challenge trials, see GLM-ST) was correlated with BOLD signals in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during dietary decisions ( , blue areas;  ,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.01, svc within left PFC). A   post hoc   comparison of the average coefficients for taste and healthiness stakes (i.e. |TR| or |HR|) within this functional ROI indicated that the left IFG region represented both attributes, rather than tracking only one or the other. Lastly, a whole-brain analysis revealed a trend for a bilateral activation of the IFG (with additional activation in the right IFG: peak MNI coordinate\u2009=\u2009[55 29 0], max   T  \u00a0=\u20095.49,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.06 whole-brain corrected), suggesting that this pattern is not strictly lateralized. Thus, this initial set of exploratory analyses indicated that the BOLD activity in the IFG is correlated with the size of the stakes for self-control challenges. \n  \nSelf-control stakes: the sketch in (A) explains the intuition for quantifying what is at stake in self-control. In the dietary self-control paradigm, any food can be categorized in one of four combinations of taste and health: tasty\u2013healthy foods (upper right quadrant) and foods that are neither tasty nor healthy (lower left quadrant) present no challenge to self-control. When taste and health are not aligned, as foods become tastier and less healthy, the need for self-control increases (upper left quadrant). The same is true for the lower right quadrant as foods become healthier and a higher desire to eat tasty needs to be overcome. The intensifying shading illustrates how both aspects become more important the farther from zero (the middle of the neutral zone of the rating scale) participants rated each aspect. Thus, adding up the distance from zero for taste and health (|tr|\u2009+\u2009|hr|) determines the self-control stakes. Note that the self-control stakes value is defined to be zero throughout the entire upper right and lower left quadrants. (B) Illustrates decision conflict or choice difficulty. In contrast to the stakes of self-control that increase with higher distance from zero, choices become more difficult when the food value approaches zero, which means the options of eating the food or nothing are very similar. Furthermore, choice difficulty can have non-zero values in all four quadrants, unlike self-control stakes. (C) Regions tracking the self-control stakes from GLM-ST: BOLD activity in the lateral PFC increased with higher stakes or importance of self-control (  P  \u00a0<\u20090.05, small-volume corrected within left lateral PFC, T-statistics derived from 5000 permutations of the data). The voxels in blue or purple indicate the results from the current sample. To further test the relationship between stakes level and BOLD activity in these voxels, we conducted an ROI analysis using the functionally defined cluster from the current sample (i.e. blue and purple voxels) as a mask. We tested whether BOLD activity in a priori, independent study ( ) showed the same association and found that BOLD signals in that sample also positively scaled with the trial-wise stakes level in these voxels (  P  \u00a0=\u20090.04,   T  \u00a0=\u20091.7472,   df  \u00a0=\u200950). The results of a whole-brain analysis for the stakes contrast in the  ) sample are shown in red. Voxels in purple represent the conjunction of the contrasts from both datasets. In both datasets, the need for self-control was tracked by voxels in the left inferior frontal gyrus, while the larger sample from  ) also identifies additional voxels in medial and dorsolateral PFC. \n    \nRegions tracking the self-control stakes parametric modulator from GLM-ST in the current study \n  \nThe reported region was significant at   P  \u00a0=\u20090.01 after small-volume family-wise error correction in a mask of the left PFC. TFCE test statistics and their null distribution (5000 permutations) were calculated with the randomize package in FSL. Anatomical labels were derived from the Harvard\u2013Oxford cortical and subcortical atlases. The analysis comprised   N  \u00a0=\u200937 participants. \n  \nIn order to test whether the correlation between IFG activity and self-control stakes could be replicated in another independent dataset, we went back to the food choice and fMRI dataset first reported in  ). We estimated the same BOLD GLM (i.e. GLM-ST) on these data and found that indeed, the BOLD signal during challenging trials tracked the stakes in this independent dataset as well. Using the same left lateral PFC mask as a small-volume search space, we observed activity in a region of the IFG that overlapped with the results from the current study ( , purple areas represent overlap between current and prior datasets), as well as the medial PFC ( , red areas;  ;   P  \u00a0<\u20090.0001 svc within left PFC). A whole-brain analysis of the  ) dataset revealed activity tracking the stakes in a large set of bilateral prefrontal voxels in the medial frontal gyrus, Brodmann areas 9 and 10, anterior cingulate, Brodmann areas 8 and 32 as well as the SMA ( ). These results show that BOLD activity in the PFC correlates with the combined taste and healthiness outcome at stake during dietary self-control challenges in two independent datasets. We also conducted an ROI analysis within the region identified in the current dataset ( , blue areas) and found that the stakes were also represented there in the dataset of   (one-sample   t  -test, one-tailed hypothesis: betas are bigger than zero;   P  \u00a0=\u20090.04,   T  \u00a0=\u20091.7472,   df  \u00a0=\u200950). \n  \nRegions tracking self-control stakes (i.e. the parametric modulator for stakes in GLM-ST) during self-control challenges in the  ) dataset \n  \n(A) All reported regions were significant at   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05 after small-volume correction for family-wise error in an anatomical mask of the left lateral PFC. (B) All reported regions were significant at   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05 after whole-brain correction for family-wise error. TFCE test statistics and their null distribution (5000 permutations) were calculated with the randomize package in FSL. Anatomical labels were derived from the Harvard\u2013Oxford cortical and subcortical atlases. The analyses in both (A and B) comprised all 51 participants of the study. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe demonstrated an association between BOLD activity during the successful reappraisal of emotional stimuli and the level of overall dietary self-control shown in a separate food choice task. Specifically, greater increase in BOLD signals in a distributed set of cortical and subcortical regions during successful emotional reappraisal was associated with better dietary self-control. Notably, many of the regions that showed this cross-domain correlation were more active for successful relative to failed reappraisal trials within our current and in previous emotion regulation experiments (see   for review). Together these results are consistent with the idea that neural processes related to the reappraisal of emotional stimuli may also facilitate dietary self-control. \n\n### Association between the tasks \n  \nDespite the seemingly straightforward answer to one of the questions motivating our experiments, our findings also contain surprises that raised intriguing questions and prompted us to conduct further analyses. For example, the relationship between BOLD activity and regulation success across tasks was not symmetric. We didn\u2019t find a significant relationship between BOLD activity during dietary self-control and self-reported reappraisal success. This may mean that stimulus reappraisal is one means of facilitating dietary self-control, but that the neural processes mediating dietary self-control are not directly relevant to stimulus reappraisal. \n\nHowever, there are several other plausible explanations for this asymmetric relationship. The lack of correlation between food choice BOLD activity and reappraisal success may also be due to individual differences in how the affective ratings are subjectively reported. Recall that we have only subjective self-reports of success in the emotion reappraisal task. Moreover, the interpretation of this null result is complicated by the fact that the fMRI results from the current food choice task differed from previous studies that used similar tasks. In contrast to previous studies ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ), we did not find significantly increased BOLD activity in the PFC as a function of dietary self-control success. \n\n\n### Dietary self-control task \n  \nDespite not showing any significant increase in PFC as a function of self-control, the participants in the current sample often made the healthier choice when faced with dietary self-control challenges. In fact, the mean overall dietary self-control success level in the current sample is among the highest we have observed across several similar experiments. Even so, the behavioral analysis showed that participants were tempted by highly palatable food items, more often failing to forego eating unhealthy items as they became more tasty. They were also sensitive to the \u2018health cost\u2019 of unhealthy foods, being more likely to eat a tasty\u2013unhealthy food if it was relatively less unhealthy (i.e. if the potential negative impact on health was lower). These results indicate that participants remained sensitive to health and tastiness attributes and did not simply follow a rule. Instead, they suggest that participants tried to actively modulate their behavior based on taste and health considerations. \n\nWhy, then, does the self-control success BOLD contrast in our dataset differ from the results in previous studies? One potential reason is that, although participants made active goal-directed choices, they also showed a bias toward refusing to eat the food items in terms of both choice outcomes and response times (i.e. faster refuse responses). We presented participants with self-control challenges on ~75% of the trials. In challenge trials, participants most often faced decisions in which success required them to refuse palatable\u2013unhealthy foods. A bias toward refusing would facilitate self-control in such cases. Indeed, the mean self-control success level for refusing palatable\u2013unhealthy foods was 77%. Furthermore, within this subset of challenges, successful self-control decisions were actually faster than choices to give into the taste temptations. The correlations between activity in visual processing regions and self-control in our data and previous EEG studies ( ) also suggest that participants may strategically bias information processing or decision strategies early in, or even prior to, choices in order to facilitate self-control. \n\nUnlike the palatable\u2013unhealthy challenges, self-control success was low in unpalatable\u2013healthy trials. The mean success level for accepting unpalatable\u2013healthy foods was only 19%. Successful healthier choices were slower than failures in this type of challenge as well. This is the opposite of the success-  vs  -failure response-time pattern seen in palatable\u2013unhealthy challenges. \n\nThe difference in self-control success levels between challenge types is consistent with previous reports, but the pattern of response times differs ( ;  ). In previous studies, self-control response times were generally slower or not significantly different than decisions that did not present a self-control challenge. However, it is worth noting that the  ) study upon which the current food choice task was based did not tailor the choice set to each individual and the median percentage of self-control challenge trials was only 22%. In other words, challenge trials occurred relatively rarely in that study, but were common in our current implementation of the task. The frequency of self-control challenges may have led participants to maintain tonic control-related activity in dlPFC and other brain regions. Alternatively, the frequent challenges may have prompted participants to engage phasic regulatory activity at the onset of each trial before determining if regulation was, in fact, needed in the current decision problem. Yet another possibility is that the frequent challenges might have led participants to shift to a decision mode that focused on healthiness attributes without the need for either tonic or phasic control-related brain activity. \n\nTheories of self-control predict that the frequency of self-control challenges will influence the probability of engaging in regulation. The key assumption in these theories is that self-regulation entails some form of costly monitoring and effort that decision-makers seek to minimize. Therefore, an individual will use self-control only when the cost of monitoring and trying to influence value computations (i.e. regulating) is smaller than the expected benefit of doing so ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ,  ). This calculation depends on how important it is to the decision-maker to choose healthy, and the state of the environment. For example,  ) theorize that in an environment consisting mainly of palatable\u2013unhealthy items, an individual could minimize regulation costs by deciding a priori not to consume foods unless she detects a healthy option rather than actively regulating on each trial. The pattern of RTs in our data (faster refusals) is consistent with such a strategy. Notably, all of these theories assume that individuals track what is at stake or the importance of control on each decision. \n\n\n### Tracking what is at stake in self-control challenges \n  \nTherefore, we conducted an exploratory analysis to look for patterns of BOLD activity that correlated with the self-control stake size on each trial. We defined the stakes as the sum of what could be gained and lost in each self-control challenge (see equation 5). We found that BOLD activity in PFC correlated with the stake size in the current participant sample, and that this result could be replicated when we repeated the same analysis in an independent dataset ( ). These results suggest that individuals track what is at stake in each self-control challenge as the theories mentioned above predict. \n\nIn summary, we cautiously speculate that our task design permitted a simplifying strategy that allowed participants to make healthy choices with less need for choice-specific dlPFC-based regulation or modulation of the value computation process. Specifically, we think that the high frequency of self-control challenge trials together with the high proportion of palatable\u2013unhealthy options within those trials prompted participants to bias their choices toward refusing to eat the proffered food items. This bias to refuse to eat food items may have reduced the need for trial-wise dlPFC engagement. This pattern of behavior may also reflect a shift from reactive to proactive forms of self-control during dietary choice ( ;  ). Therefore, we interpret our results from the food choice task as evidence for context-dependent adaptations in self-control strategies. This context specificity has important implications for the design and utilization of food choice and other paradigms designed to probe self-control and neural activity. However, we emphasize that we can only speculate at this point, and further research examining the recruitment of dlPFC for self-control in different choice environments is needed to test these hypotheses more directly. \n\n\n### Reappraisal task \n  \nIn contrast to the food choice task, our fMRI results for the emotional stimulus reappraisal task were quite consistent with previous reports on the regulation of responses to affective stimuli ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) or food images ( ;  ). Previous studies of emotion reappraisal have generally focused on the reappraisal of negative scenes and emotional reactions. Here, we extended the emotion reappraisal task to include the regulation of positive affective responses as well. Participants successfully regulated their reactions to both positive and negative stimuli. We did not find any significant differences in BOLD activity during positive   vs   negative emotion reappraisal. These results suggest that similar systems mediate the reappraisal of both affective valences. However, the standard cautions about (over-)interpreting null results apply to this result as well. \n\n\n### Limitations and further directions \n  \nWe wish to point out a few limitations of this study. First, the self-control contrasts for the dietary choice task did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. This precluded computing a conjunction between dietary self-control and emotion regulation success contrasts, which was one of the original objectives of this study. Second, a high frequency of self-control challenges was presented (~75% of all trials). Together with the high proportion of palatable\u2013unhealthy options within those challenge trials, this design feature may have prompted participants to bias the starting point for their choices toward refusing to eat the proffered foods. The ratio of health challenge to non-challenge trials should be carefully considered when designing future studies. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, we found that BOLD activity during emotion reappraisal is positively correlated with dietary self-control. In the case of dietary self-control, we can think of modulating the subjective values placed on the tastiness and healthiness attributes as a modification of the valuation or appraisal process used to place an overall value on the food items. This re- or modified appraisal of the food items leads to healthier choices, which is the goal of dietary self-control in this task. Our findings thus suggest that the neural systems supporting emotion reappraisal can generalize to other behavioral contexts that require reevaluation to conform to the current goal. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis work has been supported by Swiss National Science Foundation grant 32003B_166566 and European Union 7th Framework Programme grant number 607310 (NUDGE-IT). \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9910278, "text_md5": "0a3abd7bfae62057883d19c437052b31", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 32], "journal": [33, 57], "publication_year": [59, 63], "title": [74, 170], "keywords": [184, 242], "abstract": [255, 1279], "body": [1288, 89674]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 32701139, "doi": "10.1093/scan/nsaa097", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9910278", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9910278"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9910278\">9910278</a>", "list_title": "PMC9910278  BOLD activity during emotion reappraisal positively correlates with dietary self-control success"}

Multivoxel activity patterns in anterior prefrontal cortex predicted levels of confidence in a domain-specific fashion, whereas domain-general signals predicting confidence and accuracy were found in a widespread network in the frontal and posterior midline. The demonstration of domain-specific metacognitive representations suggests the presence of a content-rich mechanism available to introspection and cognitive control. \n\n SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT   We used human neuroimaging to investigate processes supporting memory and perceptual metacognition. It remains controversial whether metacognition relies on a global resource that is applied to different tasks or if self-evaluative processes are specific to particular tasks. Using multivariate decoding methods, we provide evidence that perceptual- and memory-specific metacognitive representations coexist with generic confidence signals. Our findings reconcile previously conflicting results on the domain specificity/generality of metacognition and lay the groundwork for a mechanistic understanding of metacognitive judgments. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMetacognition is the capacity to evaluate the success of one's cognitive processes in various domains; for example, perception or memory ( ;  ;  ;  ). Metacognitive ability can be assessed in the laboratory by quantifying the trial-by-trial correspondence between objective performance and subjective confidence ( ;  ;  ;  ). Anatomical ( ,  ;  ;  ), functional ( ;  ;  ;  ), and neuropsychological ( ;  ;  ) evidence indicates specific neural substrates (especially in frontolateral, frontomedial, and parietal regions) contribute to metacognition across a range of task domains, including perception and memory. However, the neurocognitive architecture supporting metacognition remains controversial. Does metacognition rely on a common, domain-general resource that is recruited to evaluate performance on a variety of tasks? Or is metacognition supported by domain-specific components? \n\nCurrent computational perspectives ( ;  ) suggest that both domain-general and domain-specific representations may be important for guiding behavior. One needs to be able to compare confidence estimates in a \u201ccommon currency\u201d across a range of arbitrary decision scenarios ( ). One solution to this problem is to maintain a global resource with access to arbitrary sensorimotor mappings ( ;  ;  ). Candidate neural substrates for a domain-general resource are the frontoparietal and cingulo-opercular networks, known to be involved in arbitrary control operations ( ). In particular, the posterior medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) (encompassing the paracingulate cortex and presupplementary motor area) has been implicated in representing confidence, monitoring conflict and detecting errors across a range of tasks ( ;  ;  ;  ). Conversely, if the system only had access to generic confidence signals, then appropriate switching between particular tasks or strategies on the basis of their expected success would be compromised. Functional imaging evidence implicates human anterior PFC in tracking the reliability of specific alternative strategies during decision making ( ) and such regions may also support domain-specific representations of confidence. \n\nCurrent behavioral evidence of a shared resource for metacognition is ambiguous, in part due to the difficulty of distilling metacognitive processes from those supporting primary task performance ( ;  ;  ). Some studies have found that efficient metacognition in one task predicts good metacognition in another ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), whereas others indicate the independence of metacognitive abilities ( ;  ;  ). Recent studies using bias-free measures of metacognition have identified differences in the neural correlates of memory and perceptual metacognition in both healthy subjects ( ;  ) and neuropsychological patients ( ). However, the study of behavioral individual differences provides only indirect evidence of the neural and computational architecture supporting metacognition. \n\nHere, we investigated this ontology directly by examining neural substrates engaged when metacognitive judgments are made during perceptual and memory tasks matched for stimulus and performance characteristics. We used a combination of univariate and multivariate analyses of fMRI data to identify domain-specific and domain-general neural substrates engaged during metacognitive judgments. We also distinguished activations engaged by a metacognitive judgment from neural activity that tracks confidence level. Together, our findings reveal the coexistence of generic and specific confidence representations consistent with a computational hierarchy underpinning effective metacognition. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nThirty healthy subjects (ages 18\u201333 years, mean 24.97; SD = 4.44; 14 males) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision were monetarily compensated and gave written informed consent to participate in the study at the Center for Neural Science at New York University. The study protocols were approved by the local institutional review board. The number of participants was determined a priori at   n   = 30, which is consistent with recent guidelines on neuroimaging sample sizes ( ). Due to behavioral and in-scanner motion cutoff criteria, six subjects were excluded from further analysis (details below). We present the results of 24 subjects whose data were fully analyzed. \n\n\n#### Experimental and task design \n  \nThe experiment had a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 design: condition (confidence/follow) \u00d7 task domain (perception/memory) \u00d7 stimulus type (shapes/words). It consisted of six scanner runs, each with eight nine-trial miniblocks (72 trials per run, 432 trials in total). Perceptual and memory two-alternative forced-choice (2-AFC) tasks were presented in separate, interleaved runs (three runs per task; order counterbalanced across subjects). In each run, there were four pairs of miniblocks from the confidence and follow conditions. To avoid stimulus confounds, two different types of stimulus were used throughout the experiment. In each run, two pairs of confidence/follow miniblocks used words and the remaining two pairs used abstract shapes (interleaved and order counterbalanced across runs). \n\nIn the perceptual task, subjects were asked to report the brighter of two stimuli on each trial. In the memory task, subjects began each miniblock by learning a set of nine consecutively presented stimuli. A stimulus from this set was then presented on each subsequent trial (in randomized order) alongside a new stimulus. The subjects' task was to identify the studied stimulus. In miniblocks from the confidence condition, subjects had to rate their confidence in their performance in each trial by selecting a number from a scale of 1 to 4. In miniblocks from the follow condition, subjects had to \u201cfollow the computer\u201d in each trial by pressing the button corresponding to the highlighted number regardless of their confidence. The highlighted number was yoked to their ratings in the previous confidence miniblock (randomized presentation order) to ensure similar low-level visuomotor characteristics in both conditions for any given pair of miniblocks. \n\nSubjects were reminded at the beginning of each miniblock of the condition, task, and stimulus type that would follow. They used two fingers of their right hand to respond on an MRI-compatible button box: left stimulus (index) and right stimulus (middle). For confidence ratings, they used four fingers: 1 (index), 2 (middle), 3 (ring), and 4 (little). If subjects failed to provide either type of response within the allotted time (see   A   for details), the trial was missed and an exclamation mark was displayed for the remainder of the trial. Failing to press the highlighted number counted as a missed trial. \n\nBefore entering the scanner, participants were familiarized with the tasks and the confidence rating scale. After computing independent brightness thresholding for words and abstract shapes, subjects practiced one of each miniblock type (i.e., eight miniblocks). Instructions emphasized that confidence ratings should reflect relative confidence and participants were encouraged to use all ratings. The whole experiment lasted \u223c1.5 h. \n\n\n#### Stimuli \n  \nThe experiment was programmed in MATLAB (The MathWorks) and stimuli were presented using Psychtoolbox ( ). Abstract, 22- or 28-line shapes were created randomly by specifying an (invisible) grid of 6 \u00d7 6 squares that subtended 4 degrees of visual angle where lines could connect two vertices horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first line always stemmed from the central vertex of the invisible grid randomly connecting one of the surrounding eight vertices to ensure shape centrality within the grid. The remaining lines were drawn sequentially, ensuring that all lines were connected. Orientation and originating vertices were selected randomly. \n\nAll words were nouns of six to 12 letters with one to four syllables obtained from the Medical Research Council Psycholinguistic Database ( ). In the perceptual task, words had high familiarity, concreteness, and imageability ratings (400\u2013700). In the memory task, words had low ratings (100\u2013400) to increase task difficulty. Each word and each shape was presented once throughout the experiment (across perceptual and memory blocks, including practice trials). All subjects were tested on the same words and shapes (counterbalanced across confidence and follow conditions across subjects). Words and rating scales were presented using DS-Digital font (40 points) to make their visual features similar to the abstract shapes. \n\nTo obtain stimulus sets of similar difficulty for shapes and words, we ran a series of pilot studies in which participants rated abstract shapes' distinctiveness and then performed the memory task [15 miniblocks per subject; 171 Amazon Mechanical Turk participants (73 for shapes; 98 for words) and six subjects in the laboratory who performed a complete version of the experiment]. Based on these results, we expected a mean performance in the memory task of \u223c71% correct responses when 22- and 28-line distinctive shapes were used in the same block and \u223c83% correct when long words (6\u201312 letters) with low concreteness, imageability, and familiarity ratings (100\u2013400) were used. To further increase difficulty, we created pairs of old and new words split between the confidence and follow conditions (counterbalanced across subjects), blocked by similar semantic category (e.g., finance, argumentation, character traits, etc.), such that each new word within a block was freely associated with one old word (and when possible, vice versa) according to the University of South Florida free association normed database ( ). \n\nIn the perceptual task, the difference in brightness (\u0394  b  ) between the two stimuli was calibrated for each subject and independently for each stimulus type. The brightness of a randomly located reference stimulus was fixed (middle gray). The brightness of the nonreference stimulus was titrated using a staircase procedure similar to previous experiments ( ,  ,  ). During practice, we used a fixed, large step size two-down/one-up procedure until subjects reached 15 reversals or 90 trials. The step sizes followed recommended ratios to match the expected performance in memory blocks ( ). The experiment began with a \u0394  b   value determined by the average of the \u0394  b   values at each reversal, excluding the first one. Throughout the experiment, we kept a small step size staircase running to account for learning or tiredness. \n\nA middle gray fixation cross subtending 0.3 degrees of visual angle was presented between the two stimuli on a black background. The reference stimulus in the perceptual task and all stimuli in the memory task were middle gray. All stimuli were surrounded by an isoluminant blue bounding box separated from the stimulus by a gap of at least 0.15 degrees of visual angle. \n\n\n#### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nData analysis was performed in MATLAB and statistical analysis in RStudio ( ). We estimated metacognitive efficiency by computing log(meta-  d'  /  d'  ) where   d'   is a signal detection theoretic measure of type I sensitivity and meta-  d'   is a measure of type II sensitivity (i.e., the degree to which a subject discriminates correct form incorrect responses) expressed in the same units as type I sensitivity (  d'  ) ( ;  ). Meta-  d'   indicates the   d'   that would have been predicted to give rise to the observed confidence rating data assuming a signal detection theoretic ideal observer. Meta-  d'   =   d'   indicates an optimal type II behavior for the observed type I behavior. Meta-  d'   greater or less than   d'   indicates metacognition that is better or worse, respectively, than the expected given task performance, as may occur, for instance, if first-order decisions and confidence are supported by partly parallel processing streams ( ). We used hierarchical Bayesian estimation to incorporate subject-level uncertainty in group-level parameter estimates ( ). Certainty on this parameter was determined by computing the 95% high-density interval (HDI) from the posterior samples ( ). For correlation and individual differences analyses, we used single-subject Bayesian model fits. Two subjects were discarded for missing >10% of the trials (i.e., >1 SD from the average missed trials, which was 5%). Missed trials were not analyzed. \n\n\n#### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nBrain images were acquired using a 3T Allegra scanner (Siemens). BOLD-sensitive functional images were acquired using a T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar images (42 transverse slices, interleaved acquisition; TR, 2.34 s; TE, 30 ms; matrix size: 64 \u00d7 64; 3 \u00d7 3 mm in-plane resolution; slice thickness: 3 mm; flip angle: 90\u00b0; FOV: 126 mm). The main experiment consisted of three runs of 210 volumes and three runs of 296 volumes for the perceptual and memory tasks, respectively. We collected a T1-weighted MPRAGE anatomical scan (1 \u00d7 1\u00d71 mm voxels; 176 slices) and local field maps for each subject. \n\n\n#### fMRI data preprocessing \n  \nImaging analysis was performed using SPM12 (Statistical Parametric Mapping;  ). The first five volumes of each run were discarded to allow for T1 stabilization. Functional images were realigned and unwarped using local field maps ( ) and then slice-time corrected ( ). Each participant's structural image was segmented into gray matter, white matter, CSF, bone, soft tissue, and air/background images using a nonlinear deformation field to map it onto template tissue probability maps ( ). This mapping was applied to both structural and functional images to create normalized images to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Normalized images were spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel (8 mm FWHM). We set a within-run 1 mm rotation and 4 mm affine motion cutoff criterion, which led to the exclusion of 4 subjects, leaving a total of 24 subjects whose functional and behavioral data were fully analyzed. \n\n\n#### Univariate analysis \n  \nAll of our general linear models (GLMs) focus on the \u201crating period\u201d of each trial by specifying boxcar regressors beginning at the subjects' type I response and ending at their type II response (i.e., either confidence rating or number press). Motion correction parameters were entered as covariates of no interest along with a constant term per run. Regressors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Low-frequency drifts were excluded with a 1/128 Hz high-pass filter. Missed trials were not modeled. For judgment-related (JR) analyses, we created a GLM with two regressors of interest per run to estimate BOLD response amplitudes in each voxel during the rating period in each trial of the confidence and follow blocks. For the confidence-level-related (CLR) parametric modulation analysis, a GLM was used to estimate BOLD responses in the confidence blocks. There were two regressors of interest in each run, one modeling the confidence rating period and another that encoded a parametric modulation by the four available confidence ratings (1\u20134). \n\n##### Statistical inference. \n  \nFor the JR analysis, single-subject contrast images of the confidence and follow regressors were entered into a second-level random-effects analysis using one-sample   t   tests against zero to assess group-level significance. For the CLR parametric modulation analysis, single-subject contrast images of the parametric modulator were entered into a similar second-level random-effects analysis. For conjunction analyses of activations common to both domains, second-level maps thresholded at   p   < 0.001 (uncorrected) were intersected to reveal regions of shared statistically significant JR and CLR activity. Activations were visualized using MRIcro ( ). All second-level unthresholded statistical images were uploaded to Neurovault ( ) ( ). \n\n\n##### ROI analysis. \n  \nTo define regions of interest (ROIs), 12 mm spheres were centered at MNI coordinates identified from previous literature (see   C  ). ROIs in left rostrolateral PFC (L rlPFC) [\u221233, 44, 28], right rlPFC (R rlPFC) [27, 53, 25], and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/presupplementary motor area (dACC/pre-SMA) [0, 17, 46] were created based on ( ). The mask for precuneus (PCUN) [0, \u221264, 24] was based on ( ). The MNI   x  -coordinates for the dACC/pre-SMA and PCUN masks were set to 0 to ensure bilaterality. Beta values were extracted from subjects' contrast images for the JR and CLR univariate analyses, respectively. \n\n\n\n#### Multivoxel pattern analysis \n  \nMultivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) was performed in MATLAB using the Decoding Toolbox ( ). We classified runwise beta images from GLMs modeling JR and CLR activity patterns in ROI and whole-brain searchlight analyses. ROI MVPAs were performed on normalized, smoothed images using the ROI spheres as masks. Previous work has shown that these preprocessing steps have minimal impact on support vector machine (SVM) classification accuracy while allowing meaningful comparison across subject-specific differences in anatomy, as in standard fMRI analyses ( ;  ). A single accuracy value per subject, per condition, and per ROI was extracted and used for group analysis and statistical testing. As a control, we added a 6-mm-radius sphere centered at the ventricles [0 2 15]. \n\nWhole-brain searchlight analyses used 12 mm-radius spheres centered around a given voxel for all voxels on spatially realigned and slice-time-corrected images from each subject to create whole-brain accuracy maps. For group-level analyses, these individual searchlight maps were spatially normalized and smoothed using a Gaussian kernel (8 mm FWHM) and entered into one-sample   t   tests against chance accuracy ( ,  ). Whole-brain cluster inference was performed in the same manner as in univariate analysis. Visualizations were made with Surf Ice ( ). \n\nBefore decoding, for JR activity pattern classification, we modeled two regressors of interest per run focused on the rating periods in the confidence and follow conditions. For classification of CLR activity patterns, we collapsed ratings 1 and 2 into a low-confidence regressor and ratings 3 and 4 into a high-confidence regressor to allow binary classification. The remaining parameters of no interest were specified as in the univariate case. For the CLR searchlight analysis, we used an exclusive mask of activity patterns associated with usage of the confidence scale obtained from the successful cross-classification of button presses (1\u20132 vs 3\u20134) between the confidence and follow conditions to eliminate low-level visuomotor confounds (see   D  ). \n\nIn independent across-domain classifications, we used the runwise beta images reflecting JR and CLR activity as pattern vectors in a linear support vector classification model (as implemented in LIBSVM). We assigned each vector from each domain a label corresponding to the classes confidence (1) and follow (\u22121) in the JR analysis and low confidence (\u22121) and high confidence (1) in the CLR analysis. We trained an SVM with the vectors from one domain (three per class, six in total) and tested the decoder on the six vectors from the other domain (and vice versa) (see   A  , left), obtaining a mean average classification accuracy value for each of these two-way cross-classifications. \n\nFor within-domain classifications, we ran independent leave-one-run-out cross-validations for each domain on JR activity patterns (confidence vs follow) and CLR activity patterns (low vs high confidence). Pattern vectors from two of the three runs in each domain were used to train an SVM to predict the same classes in the vectors from the left-out run. We compared the true labels of the left-out run with the labels predicted by the model and iterated this process for the other two runs to calculate a mean cross-validated accuracy independently for each domain (see   A  , right). \n\nWe also tested the ability of confidence-related activity patterns to predict objective performance in the absence of confidence reports. We used a GLM that modeled low versus high confidence trials with a regressor that focused on the rating period and incorrect versus correct follow trials with a regressor that focused on the decision period (i.e., from stimulus onset to subjects' type I response). We performed a cross-classification analysis in which a decoder trained on confidence trials (low vs high confidence) was tested on pattern vectors from follow trials (incorrect vs correct) and vice versa (collapsed across domain). This confidence-objective performance generalization score was compared with a leave-one-run-out cross-validation analysis decoding low versus high confidence on confidence trials only (collapsed across domain). Together, these scores characterize whether a particular set of patterns are specific to confidence or also generalize to predict objective performance ( ) (see  ). \n\n\n#### Individual differences \n  \nMetacognitive efficiency scores (log meta-  d'/d'  ) for each subject were estimated independently for the perceptual and memory tasks, together with a single score collapsed across domains. These scores were inserted as covariates in second-level analyses of within-perception, within-memory, and across-domain classifications of confidence-level-related activity, respectively, to assess the parametric relationship between metacognitive efficiency and decoding success. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe analyzed the data from 24 subjects who underwent hemodynamic neuroimaging while performing two-alternative forced-choice discrimination tasks in perceptual and memory domains (  A  ). In the perceptual task, subjects were asked to indicate the brighter of two stimuli (words or abstract shapes). In the memory task, subjects were asked to memorize exemplars of the same stimulus types and then select the previously learned stimulus from two stimuli presented on each trial. In half of the trials (\u201cconfidence\u201d condition), subjects performed a metacognitive evaluation after the discrimination task by rating their confidence in the correctness of their response by selecting a number on a scale of 1 to 4 (1 = not confident; 4 = very confident). To differentiate metacognitive-related activity from visuomotor activity engaged by use of the confidence scale, in the other half of trials (\u201cfollow\u201d condition), subjects were asked to respond according to a highlighted number without evaluating confidence in their response. To avoid stimulus-type confounds, two different types of stimuli, words and abstract shapes, were used in both tasks. \n  \nTask design and performance results.    A   , Subjects performed two-alternative forced-choice discrimination tasks about perception and memory. In perception blocks, subjects selected the brighter of two stimuli. Memory blocks started with an encoding period and then subjects indicated in each trial which of two stimuli appeared during the encoding period. Abstract shapes and words were used as stimuli in both tasks. In confidence blocks, subjects rated their confidence and, in follow blocks, they pressed the highlighted number.    B   , Percentage correct responses per block type in the confidence condition. Each marker represents a subject.    C   , Mean percentage correct responses by domain averaged over subjects and stimulus types. Dotted lines indicate chance performance. Bars indicate SEM. n.s., Not significant; P, perception; M, memory. \n  \n### Behavior \n  \nWe first compared task performance, measured by percentage of correct responses, across condition, task, and stimulus type. A 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 repeated-measures ANOVA (confidence/follow \u00d7 perception/memory \u00d7 shapes/words) showed that performance was well matched across conditions (confidence vs follow) (  F   = 3.036,   p   = 0.095). None of the four paired   t   tests (domain \u00d7 stimulus) comparing performance between the confidence and follow conditions returned a significant difference (  p   > 0.05). In the remainder of the behavioral analyses, we focused on the confidence condition. Matching performance across stimulus type was more challenging because subjects' memory for words was expected to be considerably higher than that for abstract shapes trials based on pilot data (see Materials and Methods for details). Instead, we aimed to match subjects' performance independently for each stimulus type across task domains by titrating the difficulty of the perceptual task to approximate the performance expected for the corresponding stimulus type in the memory task (shapes: perceptual M = 73%, memory M = 67%; words: perceptual M = 81%, memory M = 89%;   B  ). Critically, this ensured that performance was matched across task domains when averaging stimulus types across participants (perceptual: M = 77%, memory: M = 78%; paired   t   test   t   = 0.38,   p   = 0.70;   C  ). A 2 \u00d7 2 repeated-measures ANOVA of performance in the confidence condition (perception/memory \u00d7 shapes/words) confirmed there was no main effect of domain (  F   = 0.15,   p   = 0.702). However, we observed a main effect of stimulus type due to greater overall performance on words (  F   = 75.69,   p   = 9.87 \u00d7 10 ) and a domain \u00d7 stimulus interaction due to a greater difference in performance between shapes and words in the memory compared with the perception task (  F   = 16.74,   p   = 0.00045). \n\nSubjects were faster providing type I responses in perceptual trials (M = 636 ms) than in memory trials (M = 1222 ms). There was also a small difference in reaction times between shape (M = 967 ms) and word (M = 892 ms) trials. A 2 \u00d7 2 repeated-measures ANOVA confirmed a main effect of domain (  F   = 367,   p   = 1.23 \u00d7 10 ) driven by slower reaction types in the memory task. There was also a main effect of stimulus type on response time (  F   = 8.95,   p   = 0.006), as well as a significant domain \u00d7 stimulus interaction due to a greater difference in reaction times between shapes and words in memory compared with the perception task (  F   = 5.82,   p   = 0.024). \n\nAs expected, subjects gave higher confidence ratings after correct decisions than after incorrect decisions (  A  ) and mean confidence ratings were similar across task domains (perceptual M = 2.62, memory M = 2.47; paired   t   test   t   = 1.26,   p   = 0.22). Reaction times for confidence ratings were not different between domains (perceptual M = 518 ms, memory M = 516 ms; paired   t   test   t   = 0.16,   p   = 0.87). We next estimated log (meta-  d'  /  d'  ), a metacognitive efficiency measure derived from signal detection theory that assays the degree to which confidence ratings distinguish between correct and incorrect trials ( ;  ;  ). We used hierarchical Bayesian estimation to incorporate subject-level uncertainty in group-level parameter estimates ( ). Metacognitive efficiency in the perceptual task was significantly lower than in the memory task (  p   \u223c 1; for details, see   B   and the Materials and Methods), consistent with previous findings ( ). Metacognitive efficiency above optimality (meta-  d'   =   d'  ) in memory trials suggests subjects had better metacognition than expected given their task performance, whereas the suboptimal metacognitive efficiency in perceptual trials suggests that subjects had worse metacognition than expected given their task performance (assuming an ideal observer in both cases). We did not find a correlation between subjects' individual metacognitive efficiency scores in the perceptual and memory domains (  r   = \u22120.076;   p   = 0.72;   C  ). We also evaluated the correlation coefficient within a hierarchical model of meta-  d'  , which takes into account uncertainty in subject-level model fits ( ). The 95% confidence interval on the posterior correlation coefficient overlapped zero in this analysis (\u03c1 = 0.205; HDI = [0.826, \u22120.358]), also indicating a dissociation between domains. \n  \nMetacognitive measures.    A   , Mean number of correct and incorrect trials per confidence rating.    B   , Metacognitive efficiency measured by log(meta-  d'  /  d'  ). Zero indicates that metacognitive sensitivity (meta-  d'  ) is equal to task sensitivity   d'   (i.e., the   d'   that would have been predicted to give rise to the observed confidence rating data assuming a signal detection theoretic ideal observer). Group-level hierarchical Bayesian estimates differed significantly between domains. Error bars indicate 95% HDI from posterior samples.    C   , Metacognitive efficiency scores obtained from single-subject Bayesian model fits were not correlated across perceptual and memory domains.    D   , DGI for each subject that quantifies the similarity between their metacognitive efficiency scores in each domain (see main text for details). Greater DGI scores indicate less metacognitive consistency across domains. Mean log(meta-  d'/d'  ) values for each stimulus type in both domains are shown for reference. Bars in    A    and    D    indicate SEM. ***  p   \u223c 1. P, Perception; M, memory. \n  \nWe next estimated metacognitive efficiency separately for each stimulus type (  D  ). A 2 \u00d7 2 repeated-measures ANOVA (perception/memory \u00d7 shapes/words) indicated that metacognitive efficiency was greater for memory than perception (  F   = 22.44,   p   = 8.97 \u00d7 10 ). Importantly, there was no stimulus main effect (  F   = 0.015,   p   = 0.902) and there was no interaction between domain and stimulus type (  F   = 2.835,   p   = 0.106). To further assess a potential covariation between metacognitive abilities in each domain, we calculated for each subject a domain-generality index (DGI) that quantifies the similarity between scores in each domain for each participant ( ) as follows:\n  where   M   = perceptual meta-  d'/d'   and   M   = memory meta-  d'/d'  . Lower DGI scores indicate more similar metacognitive efficiencies between domains (DGI = 0 indicates identical scores). Mean DGI for shapes (1.42), words (0.66), and collapsed by stimulus type (0.95) were higher than zero (  D  ). Metacognition for words was behaviorally more stable across domains because the DGI was smaller than for shapes (paired   t   test:   t   = 2.86;   p   = 0.009). Together, these results suggest domain-specific constraints on metacognitive ability. \n\n\n### fMRI analyses \n  \nWe next turned to our fMRI data to assess the overlap between neural substrates engaged when metacognitive judgments are made during perceptual and memory tasks. A full understanding of the neural substrates of metacognition requires an independent examination of the process of engaging in a metacognitive task and the level of confidence expressed by the subject ( ). To this end, in both univariate and multivariate analyses, we focused on two distinct features of metacognition-related activity. First, we assessed brain regions engaged in JR activity (i.e., the difference between confidence trials requiring a metacognitive judgment and the follow condition). Second, we assessed brain regions engaged in CLR activity. In univariate CLR analysis, we focused on the parametric relationship between confidence ratings (1\u20134) and neural activity. In multivariate CLR analysis, we collapsed ratings 1 and 2 into a low-confidence category and ratings 3 and 4 into a high-confidence category to allow binary classification of activity patterns. \n\n#### Univariate results \n  \n##### JR activity. \n  \nIn standard univariate analyses, we found elevated activity in dACC/pre-SMA, bilateral insulae, and superior and middle frontal gyri when contrasting the confidence against the follow condition (collapsed by domain), which is consistent with previous findings ( ) (  A  ). There were no significant clusters of activity in the reverse contrast (follow > confidence). Splitting the data by domain ( ), an interaction contrast (memory confidence > memory follow) > (perception confidence > perception follow) revealed significant clusters of activity in middle cingulate gyrus, left insula, PCUN, left hippocampus, and cerebellum (  B  , blue). No significant clusters of activity were found in the reverse interaction contrast. In a conjunction analysis, elevated activity for the confidence > follow condition was observed across both perception and memory trials in anterior cingulate and right insula (  B  , green). \n  \nfMRI univariate analysis results.

The conjunction of memory confidence > memory follow and perception confidence > perception follow contrasts is indicated in green.

A conjunction analysis revealed shared activity that was positively (green) and negatively (yellow) correlated with confidence levels in both domains.

All displayed whole-brain activations are significant at a cluster-defining threshold   p   < 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons.   p   < 0.05; except for conjunction analyses, in which we computed the intersection of two independent maps thresholded at   p   < 0.001, uncorrected. Images are displayed at   p   < 0.001. Graded color bars reflect T-statistics. Error bars indicate SEM. ***  p   < 0.001; **  p   < 0.01; *  p   < 0.05. L, Left; R, right; P, perception; M, memory. \n    \nUnivariate fMRI analysis: judgment-related activity interacted with domain \n    \nTo further quantify these effects for each task domain, we focused on four a priori ROIs in the dACC/pre-SMA, bilateral rlPFC, and PCUN (  C   and the Materials and Methods), which previous studies have found to be recruited by perceptual and memory metacognition ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ). In a series of repeated-measures 2 \u00d7 2 ANOVAS (condition \u00d7 task), we found a main effect of greater activity on confidence compared with follow trials in all ROIs except PCUN, where instead we observed a main effect of task, with increased activity on memory trials (  D  ; condition main effect: dACC/pre-SMA,   F   = 19.34,   p   = 0.0002; left rlPFC,   F   = 6.62,   p   = 0.017; right rlPFC,   F   = 9.28,   p   = 0.006; PCUN:   F   = 0.40,   p   = 0.532; task main effect: dACC/pre-SMA,   F   = 2.33,   p   = 0.14; left rlPFC,   F   = 0.95,   p   = 0.34; right rlPFC,   F   = 4.94,   p   = 0.036; PCUN:   F   = 36.78,   p   = 3.47 \u00d7 10 ). We found that the difference between confidence and follow trials was greater in memory than in perception trials in dACC/pre-SMA, recapitulating the whole-brain results (condition \u00d7 task interaction;   F   = 12.16,   p   = 0.0019; paired   t   test, memory:   t   = 5.47,   p   = 0.0001, perceptual:   t   = 1.92,   p   = 0.067). A similar interaction pattern was observed in the PCUN (condition \u00d7 task interaction:   F   = 15.86,   p   = 0.0006; paired   t   test, memory:   t   = 2.43,   p   = 0.023, perceptual:   t   = \u22121.54,   p   = 0.136). There were no interactions in frontal regions (left rlPFC,   F   = 0.07,   p   = 0.795; right rlPFC,   F   = 0.002,   p   = 0.968). These results are compatible with previous findings indicating a distinctive contribution of PCUN to memory metacognition ( ;  ). \n\n\n##### CLR activity. \n  \nWe next sought to investigate the parametric relationship between confidence level and neural activity. Collapsing across domains, we found activity in the left precentral and postcentral gyri, the posterior midline, ventral striatum, and ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) correlated positively with confidence ratings (  E  , hot colors). We also replicated negative correlations between confidence and activation in dACC/pre-SMA, parietal cortex, and bilateral PFC that have been reported in several previous studies ( ;  ;  ;  ) (  E  , cool colors). When testing for differences between these parametric regressors by domain ( ), a memory > perception contrast revealed a significant cluster of activity in right parietal cortex (  F  , blue), whereas there was no significant activity in a perception > memory contrast. Shared positive correlations between confidence and activity in perception and memory trials were found in ventral striatum and in left precentral and postcentral gyri, the latter consistent with use of the right hand to provide confidence ratings (conjunction analysis;   F  , green). Shared negative correlations with confidence were found in regions of right dorsolateral PFC and medial PFC, overlapping with pre-SMA (  F  , yellow). \n  \nUnivariate fMRI analysis: confidence-level-related activity interacted with domain \n    \nComplementing the ROI analysis of JR activity, we performed an ROI analysis of CLR activity that recapitulated the whole-brain results. We observed negative relationships between confidence and activity in dACC/pre-SMA and positive relationships in PCUN. Importantly, no significant differences in the parametric effect of confidence were found between domains in any of our a priori ROIs (  G  ; paired   t   tests: dACC/pre-SMA,   t   = \u22120.47,   p   = 0.643; left rlPFC,   t   = 0.23,   p   = 0.820; right rlPFC,   t   = 1.62,   p   = 0.119; PCUN:   t   = 0.56,   p   = 0.583). Together with the lack of marked domain-specific differences in confidence-related activity at the whole-brain level, these results are suggestive of an absence of domain specificity in confidence-related activity. However, a lack of difference between univariate activation profiles is not necessarily conclusive. For instance, differences in confidence level may be encoded in fine-grained spatial patterns of activity even when the overall BOLD activity is evenly distributed across confidence levels ( ). Similarly, whereas metacognition-related activity may show similar overall levels of activation across tasks, distributed activity patterns in frontal and parietal areas may carry distinct task-specific information ( ;  ). We next turned to multivariate analysis methods, which are sensitive to differences in spatial activity patterns, to test this hypothesis. \n\n\n\n#### Multivariate results \n  \nWe performed a series of MVPAs (  A  ) focused on both JR activity patterns and CLR activity patterns. \n  \nMVPA results. Classification designs.    A   , Left, Across-domain classification design. Pattern vectors (runwise beta images) from one domain were used to train an SVM decoder on two classes and then tested in a cross-classification of the same two classes using vectors from the other domain (and vice versa). Classification of low (L) and high (H) confidence levels is illustrated. Right, Within-domain classification design. Pattern vectors of two classes (e.g., low and high confidence) pertaining to one domain were used to train a decoder in a leave-one-run-out design that was then tested in the left-out pair. The process was iterated three times to test pairs from every run. An identical, independent cross-validation was performed on vectors from the other domain.

White diamonds/circles indicate classification was significantly different from chance, Bonferroni corrected. All clusters in    C    and    F    are significant at cluster-defining threshold   p   < 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons at   p   < 0.05. Image is displayed at   p   < 0.001. Color bars indicate T-scores. A, anterior; P, posterior. ***  p   \u2264 0.001; **  p   \u2264 0.01; *  p   < 0.05; all one-sample   t   tests are Bonferroni corrected. \n  \n##### ROI analysis of JR activity patterns. \n  \nIf metacognitive judgments are based on domain-general processes (i.e., shared across perceptual and memory tasks), then a decoder trained to classify JR activity patterns in perceptual trials should accurately discriminate JR activity patterns when tested on memory trials (and vice versa). Alternatively, domain-specific activity profiles would be indicated by significant within-domain classification of JR activity patterns in the absence of across-domain transfer. To adjudicate between these hypotheses, we performed an SVM decoding analysis using as input vectors the runwise beta images pertaining to confidence and follow trials obtained from a GLM (12 input vectors in total). For within-domain classification, we used standard leave-one-out independent cross-validations for each domain and we tested for across-domain generalization using a cross-classification analysis (see Materials and Methods for details). Chance classification in both analyses was 50%. \n\nMean within-domain classification results were significantly above chance in all ROIs (one-sample   t   tests Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons \u03b1 = 0.05/4 = 0.0125: dACC/pre-SMA   t   = 5.77,   p   = 6.99 \u00d7 10 ; L rlPFC   t   = 3.27,   p   = 0.003; R rlPFC   t   = 4.47,   p   = 0.0002; PCUN   t   = 2.98,   p   = 0.007;   B  , red and blue striped bars). In contrast, across-domain generalizations were not significantly different from chance in any ROI (one-sample   t   test Bonferroni corrected: dACC/pre-SMA,   t   = 1.95,   p   = 0.06; L rlPFC,   t   = 0.79,   p   = 0.44; R rlPFC,   t   = 1.24,   p   = 0.23; PCUN   t   = 1.40,   p   = 0.17;   B  , yellow bars). As a control, classification accuracy in the ventricles was not different from chance (across:   t   = 0.66,   p   = 0.52; within:   t   = 1.04,   p   = 0.31). This suggests that the patterns of activity that distinguish metacognitive judgments from the visuomotor control condition in one domain are distinct from analogous patterns in the other domain. In particular, within-domain classification accuracy was significantly different from across-domain classification accuracy in (dACC/pre-SMA:   t   = 2.88,   p   = 0.008) and right rlPFC (  t   = 2.24,   p   = 0.035). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that metacognitive judgments recruit domain-specific patterns of cortical activity in PFC. \n\n\n##### Searchlight analysis of JR activity patterns. \n  \nWe ran a similar decoding analysis using an exploratory whole-brain searchlight, obtaining a classification accuracy value per voxel ( ). Consistent with our ROI results, we observed significant within-domain classification in large swathes of bilateral PFC for both perception (red) and memory (blue) (  C  ,  ). Within-perception classification was also successful in parietal regions, the PCUN in particular, and within-memory activity patterns were classified accurately in occipital regions. We also identified clusters showing significant across-domain generalization (yellow) in dACC, pre-SMA, SFG (BA9), supramarginal gyrus (BA40), and bilateral IFG/insula, consistent with univariate results (  A  ). \n  \nJudgment-related activity obtained from whole-brain searchlight classification analyses \n    \n\n##### ROI analysis of CLR activity patterns. \n  \nWe next investigated whether confidence is encoded in a domain-general or domain-specific fashion by applying a similar approach to discriminate low versus high confidence trials. In this case, ROI univariate analyses did not reveal any differences in confidence-related activity between domains (  G  ). We hypothesized that if confidence level is encoded by domain-general neural activity patterns, then it should be possible to train a decoder to discriminate low (1\u20132) from high (3\u20134) confidence rating patterns in the perceptual task and then accurately classify confidence patterns on the memory task (and vice versa). In the absence of across-domain classification, significant within-domain classification is indicative of CLR domain-specific activity patterns. ROI cross-classifications and cross-validations were performed in a similar fashion as above (  A  ). Two subjects did not provide ratings for one of the classes in at least one run and were left out from the main analysis to avoid entering unbalanced training data into the classifier; however, including those subjects did not change the main result. \n\nOne-sample   t   tests (Bonferroni-corrected) showed that across-domain classification of confidence was significantly above chance in dACC/pre-SMA (  t   = 2.83,   p   = 0.010) and PCUN (  t   = 4.69,   p   = 0.0001), indicative of a generic confidence signal, but not in rlPFC (left:   t   = 1.36,   p   = 0.19; right:   t   = 0.97,   p   = 0.34) (  E  , yellow bars). In contrast, mean within-domain classification accuracy was significantly above chance in right rlPFC (  t   = 3.75,   p   = 0.001), but not in the other ROIs (dACC/pre-SMA:   t   = 2.42,   p   = 0.025; left rlPFC:   t   = 1.03,   p   = 0.32; PCUN:   t   = 1.42,   p   = 0.17; Bonferroni-corrected;   E  , red and blue striped bars). The mean confidence classification accuracy in right rlPFC was 62% (perceptual = 59%, memory = 64%), notably above a recently estimated median 55% for decoding task-relevant information in frontal regions ( ). Importantly, classification accuracy in this ROI also differed from the corresponding across-domain classification accuracy (paired   t   test   t   = 2.37,   p   = 0.028). Classification accuracy in the ventricles was not different from chance (across:   t   = \u22120.24,   p   = 0.81; within:   t   = 0.86,   p   = 0.40). When subjects with unbalanced data were included, within-domain classification accuracy in right rlPFC remained at 62%, significantly above chance (  t   = 4.22;   p   = 0.0003) and significantly different from across-domain classification accuracy (paired   t   test:   t   = 2.54;   p   = 0.018). Together, these results suggest the coexistence of two kinds of CLR neural activity: dACC/pre-SMA and PCUN encode a generic confidence signal, whereas patterns of activity in right rlPFC were modulated by task, allowing within- but not across-domain classification of confidence level. \n\n\n##### Searchlight analysis of CLR activity patterns. \n  \nWe ran a similar decoding analysis of confidence level using an exploratory whole-brain searchlight, obtaining a classification accuracy value per voxel. Here, we leveraged the follow trials as a control for low-level visuomotor confounds by exclusively masking out activity patterns associated with usage of the confidence scale (  D  ). The remaining activity patterns can therefore be ascribed to CLR signals that do not encode visual or motor features of the rating (  F  ,  ). We found widespread across-domain classification of confidence (yellow) in a predominantly midline network including a large cluster encompassing dACC/pre-SMA, vmPFC, and ventral striatum. Domain-specific CLR activity patterns were successfully decoded from right PFC (insula, IFG, BA9, BA46) in memory trials (blue) and were also independently decoded in both domains from dACC/pre-SMA. \n  \nConfidence level-related activity obtained from whole-brain searchlight classification analyses \n    \n\n##### Generalization of CLR activity to objective performance. \n  \nTo further address the question of how confidence judgments may relate to activity patterns, we examined the relationship between objective task accuracy and confidence. Previous work suggested that the neural basis (and associated activation patterns) of confidence and performance may be partly distinct ( ;  ). Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that we could train a decoder using CLR activity patterns to classify objective performance-related activity patterns (correct/incorrect) on follow trials (and vice versa) in a cross-classification analysis (collapsed across domain). This analysis confirmed that activity patterns in dACC/pre-SMA (  t   = 2.38,   p   = 0.027) and right rlPFC (  t   = 2.64,   p   = 0.015) could predict objective accuracy levels in follow trials above chance ( , light gray; uncorrected), but not in left rlPFC (  t   = 1.49,   p   = 0.15) or PCUN (  t   = \u22120.46,   p   = 0.65). We then compared these decoding scores with a leave-one-run-out cross-validation decoding analysis of low versus high confidence on confidence trials only (collapsed by domain;  , dark gray; uncorrected). Consistent with the analyses reported in   E   (yellow), this decoder was unable to classify domain-general confidence patterns of activity in right rlPFC (  t   = 1.00;   p   = 0.33), but was above chance in dACC/pre-SMA (  t   = 3.80,   p   = 0.001), left rlPFC (  t   = 2.26,   p   = 0.034), and PCUN (  t   = 2.56,   p   = 0.018). Critically, in PCUN, confidence classification was significantly greater than confidence-performance generalization, which was at chance (paired   t   test   t   = 2.16,   p   = 0.043). This result indicates that confidence-related patterns in PCUN do not generalize to predict objective performance, consistent with a partly distinct coding of information relevant to task performance and confidence. In contrast, in dACC/pre-SMA, general confidence level and performance could be predicted from common patterns of activation. \n  \nGeneralization of confidence-related activity to objective accuracy.

To test for such a relation, we investigated whether individual metacognitive efficiency scores collapsed across domains and independently in each domain predicted searchlight classification accuracy of confidence level. We did not find any significant clusters after whole-brain correction for multiple comparisons in domain-general, within-perception, or within-memory analyses. However, memory metacognitive efficiency predicted memory confidence classification accuracy in a cluster in right PCUN and left precentral gyrus (  p   < 0.001, uncorrected), whereas perceptual metacognitive efficiency predicted perceptual confidence classification accuracy in left middle frontal gyrus, right vmPFC, bilateral temporal gyri, and cerebellum (  p   < 0.001, uncorrected). Previous studies ( ,  ;  ) have reported similar relations between perceptual and memory metacognitive efficiency and individual differences in the structure of prefrontal and parietal cortex, respectively. Although we do not interpret these findings further here, for completeness, second-level unthresholded statistical images of these analyses were uploaded to Neurovault to inform future work ( ) ( ). \n\n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWhen performing a cognitive task, confidence estimates allow for comparisons of performance across a range of different scenarios ( ). Such estimates must also carry information about the task context if they are to be used in decision making. Here, we investigated the domain generality and domain specificity of representations that support metacognition of perception and memory. \n\nUnlike previous studies ( ), subjects' performance was matched between domains for two different types of stimulus, thereby eliminating potential performance and stimulus confounds. Subjects' confidence ratings were also matched between domains and followed expected patterns of higher ratings after correct decisions than after incorrect decisions. Metacognitive efficiency scores between tasks were not correlated and metacognitive efficiency scores in the memory task were superior to those in the perceptual task. Using univariate and multivariate analyses, we showed the existence of both domain-specific and domain-general metacognition-related activity during perceptual and memory tasks. We report four main findings and discuss each of these in turn. \n\nFirst, we obtained convergent evidence from both univariate and multivariate analyses that a cingulo-opercular network centered on dACC/pre-SMA encodes a generic signal predictive of confidence level and objective accuracy across memory and perceptual tasks. Previous studies of metacognition have implicated the cingulo-opercular network in tracking confidence level ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, we go beyond these previous studies to provide evidence that these signals generalize to predict confidence across two distinct cognitive domains. This finding is consistent with posterior medial frontal cortex as a nexus for monitoring the fidelity of generic sensorimotor mappings, building on previous findings that error-related event-related potentials originating from this region are sensitive to variation in subjective certainty ( ;  ). The activity in dACC/pre-SMA was also consistently elevated by the requirement for a metacognitive judgment ( ). However, the results regarding the generalizability of the pattern of these increases across tasks were inconclusive. Whole-brain searchlight analysis revealed successful cross-classification of these activity patterns in dACC and insular regions, consistent with the results of the univariate analysis. These patterns of activity, however, did not generalize across tasks in a predefined region of interest centered in dACC/pre-SMA. \n\nAlthough both dACC/pre-SMA and PCUN showed significant domain-general decoding of confidence, in PCUN these patterns did not generalize to also predict changes in objective accuracy. Whereas performance and subjective confidence may both depend on similar decision variables ( ;  ), behavioral dissociations between these quantities are also consistent with distinct internal states contributing to decisions and confidence ratings ( ;  ). For instance, hierarchical models of confidence formation suggest a downstream network \u201creads out\u201d decision-related information in a distinct neural population ( ). The observed lack of cross-classification in PCUN ( ) is consistent with the recent observation of distinct neural patterns of activity pertaining to confidence and first-order performance revealed through multivoxel neurofeedback in frontal and parietal regions ( ). \n\nSecond, in lateral anterior frontal cortex, we found activity patterns that tracked both the requirement for metacognitive judgments and level of confidence. Large swathes of lateral PFC distinguished activity patterns pertaining to metacognitive judgments that were specific for each domain. Critically, however, confidence-related activity patterns were selective for domain in right rlPFC (  E  ): they differed according to whether the subject was engaged in rating confidence about perception or memory. Such signals may support the \u201ctagging\u201d of confidence with contextual information, thereby facilitating the use of confidence for behavioral control ( ;  ). The identity of perceptual and memory tasks can be reliably decoded from activity in right PFC neural populations ( ), consistent with the possibility that this contextual information is recruited during confidence rating. It is possible that anterior prefrontal regions combine generic confidence signals with domain-specific information to fine-tune decision making and action selection in situations in which subjects need to regularly switch between tasks or strategies on the basis of their reliability ( ). An alternative hypothesis, also compatible with our data, is that PFC first estimates the confidence level specifically for the current task, which is then relayed to medial areas to recruit the appropriate resources for cognitive control in a task-independent manner. Processing dynamics may also unfold simultaneously in both areas. These possibilities echo a longstanding debate in the cognitive control literature on the relative primacy of medial and lateral PFC in the hierarchy of control ( ;  ). Further inquiry and development of computational models of the hierarchical or parallel functional coupling of these networks in metacognition is necessary. \n\nThird, we obtained convergent evidence that PCUN plays a specific role in metamemory judgments. In univariate fMRI analyses, we found that the requirement for a metacognitive judgment recruited our preestablished region of interest centered on PCUN only on memory, but not perceptual, trials (  D  ). Individual metacognitive efficiency scores in memory trials predicted classification accuracy in a more dorsal precuneal region, whereas individual differences in metacognitive efficiency scores in perceptual trials predicted classification accuracy in vmPFC (albeit at uncorrected thresholds). These findings are consistent with the medial parietal cortex making a disproportional contribution to memory metacognition ( ;  ;  ) and offer a potential explanation for a decrease in perceptual, but not memory, metacognitive efficiency seen in patients with frontal lesions ( ). However, we do not conclude that PCUN involvement is specific to metamemory. We note that univariate negative correlations with confidence were found also on perceptual trials and multivariate classification results in PCUN indicated the presence of both perceptual- and memory-related signals. This dual involvement of the PCUN in perception and memory metacognition is consistent with previous studies suggesting a relationship between PCUN structure and visual perceptual metacognition ( ;  ). \n\nFourth, we found in both univariate and multivariate whole-brain analyses that domain-general signals in the ventral striatum and vmPFC (including subgenual ACC) were modulated by confidence level. These results are compatible with previous findings finding activity in the ventral striatum to be positively correlated with confidence ( ;  ;  ). Evidence of vmPFC encoding of confidence signals has been reported in connection with decision making and value judgments ( ;  ). Our experimental design, however, does not allow us to disentangle whether the signals found in these regions pertain uniquely to confidence or if they are entangled with implicit value and reward signals (e.g., the expected value of being correct). Future experiments are needed to explicitly decouple reward from confidence to resolve this issue. \n\nIn our experimental design, perception and memory blocks were interleaved across runs, which raises the question as to whether the domain-specific neural substrates that we found would persist if subjects had to switch between tasks more often. Due to intertask \u201cleaks\u201d in confidence ( ), in which confidence in one task influences confidence ratings on the following task (or even in the following trial), there is a possibility that interleaving blocks of different tasks might favor the observation of more domain-general confidence-related patterns. \n\nOur experimental design assumes that visual perception and memory are distinct domains. We acknowledge that distinguishing between cognitive domains or individuating perceptual modalities is not straightforward ( ). For instance, different modalities (e.g., vision, audition, touch, etc.), different aspects within a single modality (e.g., motion and color within vision), or closely related modalities (e.g., visual perception vs visual short-term memory) could be part of a unified perceptual domain for metacognitive purposes. Recent findings suggest that metacognitive efficiency in one perceptual modality predicts metacognitive efficiency in others and that they share electrophysiological markers ( ). Metacognitive efficiency is also correlated across vision and visual short-term memory, especially for features such as orientation ( ), and dACC and insula regions similar to those identified here have been found to show univariate confidence signals across both color and motion tasks in the visual domain ( ). However, it is an open question whether more fine-grained, modality-specific patterns of metacognitive activity could be decoded using multivariate approaches. More research is needed on the neural architecture of metacognition in other cognitive domains and whether this architecture changes in a graded or discrete fashion as a function of task or stimulus. \n\nIn summary, our results provide evidence for the coexistence of content-rich metacognitive representations in anterior PFC with generic confidence-related signals in frontoparietal and cingulo-opercular regions. Such an architecture may be appropriate for \u201ctagging\u201d lower-level feelings of confidence with higher-order contextual information to allow effective behavioral control. Previous studies have tended to draw conclusions about either domain-specific or domain-general aspects of metacognition. Here, we reconcile these perspectives by demonstrating that both domain-specific and domain-general signals coexist in the human brain, thus laying the groundwork for a mechanistic understanding of reflective judgments of cognition. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5895040, "text_md5": "b6e353588f6e5fbcf581ceec33b97cba", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 54], "journal": [55, 65], "publication_year": [67, 71], "title": [82, 189], "keywords": [203, 256], "abstract": [269, 2088], "body": [2097, 64928]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 29519851, "doi": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2360-17.2018", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5895040", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5895040"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5895040\">5895040</a>", "list_title": "PMC5895040  Domain-General and Domain-Specific Patterns of Activity Supporting Metacognition in Human Prefrontal Cortex"}

This behaviour has been associated with an imbalance in the integration of the networks involved in cognitive control and motivational processes. We examined whether the influence of emotional cues on cognitive control differs between adolescents who show high or low levels of risk-taking behaviour. Participants who scored especially high or low on a risky decision task were subsequently administered an emotional go/no-go fMRI task comprising angry, happy and calm faces. Both groups showed decreased cognitive control when confronted with appetitive and aversive emotional cues. Activation in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) increased in line with the cognitive control demands of the task. Though the risk taking groups did not differ in their behavioural performance, functional connectivity analyses revealed the dorsal striatum plays a more central role in the processing of cognitive control in high than low risk-takers. Overall, these findings suggest that variance in fronto-striatal circuitry may underlie individual differences in risk-taking behaviour. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAdolescence is a period characterised by increases in risk-taking and reward seeking, behaviours which have been described as both adaptive and maladaptive ( ). Though these tendencies have often been related to adverse outcomes, such as increases in instances of unintentional injuries, road traffic accidents, unsafe sexual behaviour and substance abuse ( ;  ), recent work has also suggested that higher levels of risk-taking may lead to increased exploration-based learning ( ;  ). Adolescents appear to respond differently to risks than adults, and both the positive and negative consequences of the resulting risk-taking behaviours suggest that an increased understanding of the mechanisms underlying this behaviour could have important societal implications. \n\nAt a neural level, various models have been proposed to explain adolescent risk-taking. A set of so-called dual systems or imbalance models has suggested that this behaviour is associated with a disparity in the integration of the networks involved in motivational processes and inhibitory control (for recent overviews see  ;  ;  ). These models posit that adolescence, compared to childhood and adulthood, is characterised by changes in activity in subcortical circuitry involved in affect and reward processing, such as the amygdala and ventral striatum ( ;  ). Conversely, the prefrontal cognitive control systems which interact with motivational systems show a more linear and protracted development. With age, frontal control over subcortical regions is thought to increase, thereby enabling greater behavioural regulation ( ;  ). But during adolescence these cortico-subcortical circuits are still developing, leading to a developmental imbalance in the influence of subcortical systems on behaviour ( ;  ). Consequently, when adolescents are exposed to emotionally or motivationally salient information they are often unable to sufficiently recruit inhibitory control resources to down-regulate robust appetitive drives. This leads to a greater influence of appetitive information on adolescent behaviour than during childhood and adulthood, often resulting in impulsive behaviour. \n\nWhile there is much research that supports these imbalance models, some have suggested that the claims may be overly simplistic, and do not fully reflect the diversity of findings within the field (see for example  ). For example, while numerous studies have shown hyperresponsiveness in the amygdala and striatum during adolescence (e.g.  ;  ;  ;  ), there are also a number of studies which did not replicate these findings (e.g.  ;  ; see also  ). This has led to the suggestion that adolescent neural responses may vary as a function of stimuli, context and task demands ( ). For example, in situations where motivational and affective demands are low, adolescents are often able to exhibit regulatory function that is comparable to that of adults ( ). However, the reality of adolescence is that many of the situations adolescents find themselves in are emotionally charged, for example due to the presence of their peers. During adolescence social relationships become increasingly important, and consequently social acceptance becomes a powerful motivator for adolescents to conform to patterns of behaviour that receive approval from their social group ( ). As a result, they are frequently confronted with situations with could potentially undermine their developing cognitive control abilities, and some are able to navigate this more successfully than others. The current study aims to elucidate how the interplay between emotional cues and cognitive control differs between adolescents who show high or low levels of risk-taking behaviour. \n\nA number of previous studies have assessed the interaction between emotional cues and inhibitory control using an emotional go/no-go paradigm, though these interactions have not been explicitly linked to risk-taking behaviours. Compared to adults and children, adolescents appear to be less able to suppress responses to appetitive cues such as happy faces, as well as showing enhanced reward-related activation in the ventral striatum in response to these stimuli ( ). Aversive stimuli, such as fearful or threatening faces, similarly decrease inhibitory control and slow response times in adolescent samples ( ). These behaviours are paralleled by increased activation during the task in limbic regions such as the amygdala, and decreased recruitment of prefrontal regions, rendering adolescents more sensitive to emotional interference during the task ( ;  ). Increased connectivity between these regions has been associated with improvements in cognitive control ( ). Even in a task where the emotional information was task-irrelevant, adolescents were more distracted than adults by negative stimuli, though not by positive stimuli ( ;  ). These studies suggest that adolescents find it more difficult than children or adults to suppress their responses when faced with emotional stimuli, regardless of whether the emotional information is task relevant or irrelevant. \n\nMost previous work on emotional inhibition has examined reactivity to fearful and happy facial emotions. While this provides insight into affective interference caused by differences in valence between these negative and positive emotions, the compared emotions differ in their motivational underpinnings: happiness is an approach-related emotion, but fear is an avoidance-related emotion. In order to distinguish the effect of these motivational differences from those due to the valence of the emotions, a negative social emotion associated with approach tendencies would be a more suitable comparison. Research has shown that anger is related to the approach motivational system ( ;  ), as it involves a reaction to something aversive, often resulting in an active effort to change this. Thus, a comparison of happiness and anger would help to examine the potential differential effects of positive and negative emotions on adolescent impulse control. \n\nIn this study we aimed to extend previous work by investigating how the decreased ability to regulate behaviour in emotional contexts is related to adolescent risk-taking. We examined the effect of emotional information on cognitive control in a group of high risk-taking and a group of low risk-taking adolescents using an emotional go/no-go paradigm ( ;  ). This type of task has been shown to enable reliable assessment of the effects of the affective context on task performance ( ). Happy, angry and calm faces were used as stimuli, and participants were instructed to respond to one emotion and ignore the other. We examined the differential effects of happy and angry faces, as well as differences in these effects between the risk-taking groups at both a behavioural and neural level. \n\nAdditionally, we used graph-theoretical methods to model functional connectivity between brain regions, to see if these regions play a differential role in emotional impulse control in low and high risk-taking adolescents. Graph-theoretical measures can be used to construct easily computable representations of relatively complex data and are therefore ideally suited to summarize functional connectivity networks ( ). In theory, interpreting task-based functional connectivity networks can be quite complicated as even if just a few regions are used, this involves assessing a vast number of separate potential connections between these regions. Graph theory facilitates this interpretation by allowing examination of characteristics of the network, while also considering the different functional connections between the regions that comprise it. Framing functional connectivity in terms of a network thus diminishes the need to separately look and test for all possible connections between ROIs, and instead computes a small number of neurobiologically meaningful measures ( ). Thus, it allows quantification and interpretation of the relative importance a region plays within a network, without having to interpret each of the connections between regions. This makes it a more powerful, and often more intuitive approach. Furthermore, it follows recent calls for a shift from one-to-one mappings of psychological states and regions of the brain towards network-based analyses which recognise the computational roles of the regions involved ( ;  ). \n\nIn our analyses we used the concept of degree centrality as a measure to describe the relative importance of a region within a functional connectivity network. Degree centrality, which corresponds to the number of connections a given region has, is viewed as the most fundamental network measure, as all other network measures are ultimately linked to it ( ). In a functional connectivity network, connections between regions reflect the magnitude of correlations over time ( ). Consequently, the centrality of a ROI in a functional connectivity network reflects synchronous information processing across the regions it is connected to. Differences between centrality scores thus highlight differences in the importance of a region across task conditions and/or experimental groups. It is important to note that since functional connectivity networks are undirected (i.e. the correlation between region A and B is the same as between B and A), centrality does not reflect the direction of information flow between regions. \n\nIn addition to degree centrality, network analyses often examine measures reflecting functional integration in the brain, which reflect the ease with which regions in the network communicate ( ). A frequently used measure is that of the shortest path length between nodes (e.g. brain regions) in a network, with shorter path lengths revealing greater potential for integration between regions. In our analyses we use both centrality and shortest path length measures to examine functional connectivity within an   a priori   defined fronto-striatal network of regions known to be involved in emotion processing and cognitive control. \n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe initial sample consisted of 35 healthy adolescents. Data from one participant was excluded due to incorrect inhibition on all no-go trials in three of the four runs, leaving a sample of 34 participants (20 female,   M   age\u202f=\u202f14.57,   SD   age\u202f=\u202f0.80, range: 13.21\u201316.41). Participants were recruited from a larger sample (  N  \u202f=\u202f323) in an ongoing longitudinal project examining cognitive and socio-emotional development during adolescence (see e.g.:  ;  ). During data collection for this project all participants completed the Columbia Card Task (CCT;  ). The CCT measures risk-taking under conditions of low and high emotional arousal. During this task, participants draw from a deck of cards, with each card earning or losing them points. The amount of gain and loss and the number of loss cards in the deck varies across trials. Consequently, the CCT is considered a dynamic risk-taking task: the risk parameters change each time a card is turned over. Such tasks are thought to be more reflective of real world behaviour than static tasks, as well as being more engaging for the participant ( ). In the \u2018hot\u2019 condition of the CCT, participants are shown the outcome of each card after turning it over, and subsequently decide if they wish to continue or move on to the next trial. This condition measures risk-taking under high emotional arousal, as evidenced by increases in physiological measures of arousal such as the skin conductance response ( ), as well as significant correlations between performance and measures of reward responsiveness ( ). The CCT has been shown to have good test-retest reliability ( ). All participants in the larger longitudinal sample were ranked based on their deviation from optimal performance during the \u2018hot\u2019 condition of the task (defined as the difference between the mathematically optimal number of cards per condition and the actual number of cards chosen). The top and bottom 30% of the longitudinal sample (  n  \u202f=\u202f220), defined as a high risk-taking and low risk-taking group, were subsequently approached to participate in the current study. Of the approached sample 15% were included in the current study, with orthodontic braces forming a constraint for the majority of those who were unable to participate. Participating adolescents did not differ in age from those who were approached but didn\u2019t participate (  t  (45.59)\u202f=\u202f1.04;   p  \u202f=\u202f.303), sex (  \u03a7  (1)\u202f=\u202f2.87;   p\u202f=\u202f  .090), or in CCT scores (  t  (44.17)\u202f=\u202f0.22;   p  \u202f=\u202f.823). In line with our selection criteria, the two risk-taking groups significantly differed on multiple aspects of their CCT performance, both with regards to performance and outcomes. The low risk-taking group chose a close to optimal number of cards (  M  \u202f=\u202f0.14,   SD  \u202f=\u202f1.00) while the high risk group selected more cards than optimal (  M  \u202f=\u202f7.47,   SD  \u202f=\u202f1.01; difference low vs high:   t  (31.44)\u202f=\u202f21.27,   p\u202f<  \u202f.001). The low risk group ended trials before a loss card was drawn (or turned over no cards during the trial) on an average of 71.2% (  SD  \u202f=\u202f10.0%) of trials, while the high risk group did so on only 48.2% (  SD  \u202f=\u202f10.3%) of trials. This difference was significant   t  (31.28)\u202f=\u202f6.581;   p\u202f  <\u202f.001. In addition, the low risk group finished the task with average earnings of \u22120.12 euro (SD\u202f=\u202f7.37) while the high risk group earned an average of -7.53 euro (SD\u202f=\u202f7.67). This difference was also significant   t  (31.16)\u202f=\u202f2.860;   p\u202f  =\u202f .007. \n\nAll participants were typically developing, had normal vision, reported no neurological or psychiatric disorders and had no contraindications for MRI. Demographic characteristics are reported in  . Age and sex did not differ between the two risk-taking groups (age:   t  (30.98)\u202f=\u202f1.17,   p\u202f  =\u202f.249; sex:   \u03a7  (1)\u202f=\u202f0.08,   p\u202f  =\u202f.773). Consent for all phases of the project was obtained from the Ethical Committee of the University of Amsterdam Faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences. All participants and their guardians provided written informed consent prior to participation.   \nParticipant characteristics. \n  Table 1     \n\n\n### Measures \n  \n#### Task development \n  \nThe emotional go/no-go task ( ;  ) comprising calm, happy and angry facial expressions was refined during an initial pilot phase to ensure comparable levels of emotional valence between conditions in adolescents. A group of 126 adolescents were recruited from local schools specifically for the pilot. Participants rated the valence of 96 (32 per emotion) calm, happy and angry faces from the NimStim set of facial expressions ( ) using a Likert scale ranging from \u22124 (strongly negative) to +4 (strongly positive). Participants reported how realistic they found the expressions using a 7-point Likert scale (1\u202f=\u202fcompletely unrealistic, 7\u202f=\u202fvery realistic). \n\nIn the happy and angry conditions, the data were used to select the 10 faces (5 male, 5 female) which the participants found most realistic and with the highest absolute valence ratings in the intended direction. Mean valence ratings were balanced between the happy and angry conditions to ensure that differences between the emotions were not due to the intensity of the emotions displayed. A set of 10 faces (5 male, 5 female) was also selected for the calm condition, based on those faces rated by the participants as most realistic, and with the most neutral valence ratings. Calm faces were used as neutral stimuli, as previous research has shown that neutral faces are often characterised by participants as portraying negative emotions ( ). All conditions comprised a combination of open and closed mouths. \n\n\n#### Experimental task \n  \nA modified emotional go/no-go task was created with stimuli selected based on data from the pilot phase ( ). Within a go/no-go paradigm participants are instructed to press a button as quickly as possible when shown a \u2018go\u2019 (i.e., target) stimulus and to inhibit their response by not pressing the button when shown a \u2018no-go\u2019 (i.e., non-target) stimulus.   \nGo/no-go task design. The figure displays three trials in a run with calm faces as target stimuli and angry faces as non-targets. \n  Fig. 1   \n\nThe rapid event-related task comprised four blocks presented across four different runs. Each block contained two facial emotions (calm and happy, or calm and angry), one instructed to be the target and one as the non-target stimulus, leading to four conditions: (i) happy go/calm no-go, (ii) happy no-go/calm go, (iii) angry go/calm no-go, and (iv) angry no-go/calm go. \n\nAt the start of each block participants were shown a screen indicating the target emotion for that block, and reminding them not to respond to other emotions. Each block consisted of 16 trials, with targets (\u2018go\u2019) occurring on 75% of these trials, resulting in a total of 96 angry/happy go trials (48 happy, 48 angry), 32 angry/happy no-go trials (16 happy, 16 angry), 96\u202fcalm go trials and 32\u202fcalm no-go trials across the four runs (256 trials in total). Trials within a block, and block order within a run, were randomized across participants. Each trial started with a face, which was displayed for 500\u202fms, followed by a fixation cross which was displayed for a variable interstimulus interval between 1500\u202fms\u20132500\u202fms (in steps of 500\u202fms). After the last trial of a block, the fixation cross was displayed for 10\u202fs. During the last trial of a run the fixation cross was displayed for 20\u202fs in order to acquire the final BOLD response in full. \n\nThe task was presented in Presentation using a projection screen and mirror within the head coil. Responses were recorded using a response box attached to the participant\u2019s respiratory belt. Participants responded with their right index finger. \n\n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nParticipants were scanned with a 3\u202fT Philips Achieva XT with a 32-channel receiver head coil. Functional images were acquired using a single shot GE-EPI sequence (MS-FFE single shot EPI, TE\u202f=\u202f27.63, FA\u202f=\u202f76.1, SENSE (AP)\u202f=\u202f2, FOV\u202f=\u202f240 , Bandwidth \u202f=\u202f36.2\u202fHz) with a voxel size of 3*3*3\u202fmm (37 slices with an interslice gap of 0.3\u202fmm) and a TR of 2\u202fs. Structural images were acquired using a fast MPRage sequence (3DFFE multishot TFE, TR\u202f=\u202f8.2, TE\u202f=\u202f3.8, FA\u202f=\u202f8, Sense P(RL)\u202f=\u202f2.5, Sense S(FH)\u202f=\u202f2, FOV\u202f=\u202f240*188, Bandwidth\u202f=\u202f191.4\u202fHz), with a voxel size of 1*1*1 mm (220 slices). \n\n\n### Analyses \n  \n#### Behavioural data analysis \n  \nFour behavioural outcome measures were computed based on the go/no-go task: proportion of hits (correct response to go stimulus), misses (failure to respond to go stimulus), correct rejections (correct withholding of response to no-go stimulus) and false alarms (incorrect response to no-go stimulus) across all trials. Mean reaction times for hits and false alarms were also calculated. Differences in performance between the risk-taking groups on trials classified as misses, false alarms, and reaction times on hit and false alarm trials, were analysed using a 3 (Emotion: calm, happy, angry)\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 (Risk-taking: high, low) ANOVA (linear mixed model with a random intercept across participants). Post-hoc paired samples   t  -tests were used to further examine significant interactions. \n\n\n#### Imaging data analysis \n  \nPre-processing and General Linear Model (GLM) analyses were performed using FSL ( ). Functional images were brain extracted ( ), motion corrected and registered to the structural images using linear registration (FLIRT (BBR 12 dof),  ). For the group analyses images were registered to standard MNI space. Time-series were pre-whitened and low-pass filtered (90\u202fs). Spatial smoothing was applied using a 6\u202fmm FWHM kernel. Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) responses were modeled as a double-gamma Haemodynamic Response Functions (HRF) with a temporal derivative to account for differences in slice acquisition time. The GLM design matrix included six main regressors (angry go, angry no-go, happy go, happy no-go, calm go, and calm no-go) and two regressors of no interest (errors and instruction screens). Motion regressors (6) derived from MCFLIRT ( ) were added to the GLM design matrix as regressors of no interest, and volumes with excessive motion (Root mean square (RMS)\u202f>\u202f0.75 percentile\u202f+\u202f1.5*Interquartile Range (IQR) using   fsl_motion_outliers  ) were regressed out using additional confound regressors. Mean number of volumes censored per run was 6.07 (  SD  \u202f=\u202f3.40, Range\u202f=\u202f(223)). Average motion over all runs and subjects was 0.73\u202fmm (  SD  \u202f=\u202f0.88). In five runs, maximum motion exceeded 3\u202fmm (two runs maximum motion was 5.26\u202fmm, in one run motion was 4.39, in one run motion was 3.62, and in one run motion was 3.28\u202fmm). Motion in these volumes was also censored. Four out of 136 runs (4 runs\u202f\u00d7\u202f34 subjects) were discarded due to no correct inhibitions on happy no-go trials (3 runs) or no correct inhibitions on angry no-go trials (1 run). \n\nA-priori region-of-interest (ROI) masks were generated bilaterally for the amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (FSL Harvard Oxford Atlas, 50% probability threshold), dorsal striatum and ventral striatum (FSL Striatum Atlas). These regions have been reported previously as being activated during emotional go/no-go tasks and implicated in cognitive control ( ;  ). \n\nTo confirm that regions previously implicated in emotional go/no-go paradigms were also activated in our sample, two whole-brain GLM analyses (Familywise Error (FWE) corrected with a cluster-forming threshold of   Z\u202f  >\u202f3.1; cluster-wise   p\u202f  <\u202f.05;  ) were examined. First, an emotional (angry\u202f+\u202fhappy)\u202f>\u202fcalm contrast was used to examine involvement of regions usually active in emotional paradigms. Second, a no-go\u202f>\u202fgo contrast was used to examine the contribution of regions associated with inhibitory control. \n\nTo examine differences between the risk-taking groups, masks were constructed as a 4\u202fmm radius sphere centred at the peak voxel in each a-priori defined ROI for each of the six trial types and subjects separately. Parameter estimates were extracted from this sphere for each ROI for each of the six trial types (calm go, calm no-go, happy go, happy no-go, angry go, angry no-go). An overview of the MNI coordinates of the spheres extracted from each ROI is given in  . The extracted values were used in a 3 (Emotion: calm, happy, angry)\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 (Trial Type: go, no-go)\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 (Risk-taking: high, low) ANOVA (linear mixed model with a random intercept across participants). Where appropriate   t  -tests were used to further examine significant interactions.   \nMedian (bold), minimum and maximum values of the peak-voxel coordinates (across subjects, split for each condition) within each predefined Region-of-Interest. All coordinates are in MNI space. \n  Table 2   \n\nThe ROI analyses were followed by an analysis to estimate functional connectivity in each condition between the eight regions of interest for each individual participant. We used a graph-theoretical approach using beta-series to determine connectivity between ROIs. This approach entails constructing a network with the 8 ROIs for each condition and each subject, with the nodes of the network defined by the 8 ROIs and the connections between the nodes defined by the correlation of the beta-series of these ROIs. To construct the network, we first summarized activity over time by taking the first eigenvector of all the time-series of each voxel within each ROI ( ). This resulted in a time-series characteristic of each of the eight ROIs. On these time-series single trial estimates of activity were calculated using the Least-Squares Single (LSS) method by   and  . This method entails performing a GLM for each trial in the experiment separately. In each GLM the trial of interest (e.g., the first calm no-go trial in a run) is modelled as a single regressor, with the other trials of the same stimulus type (e.g., the second through to the last calm no-go trial) as a second regressor. Other trials of other stimulus types (i.e. conditions) are added as additional regressors, as are the confound regressors (e.g. motion parameters) used in the ROI analyses. This resulted in an estimate of the amplitude of activation for each single trial in the experiment. Single-trial estimates where then concatenated over runs within each condition, resulting in an \u2018amplitude\u2019 time-series for each condition for each subject in the experiment. \n\nNext, for each condition in the experiment, we defined a network with the eight ROIs as nodes and the correlation between the amplitude time-series of the different ROIs as edges. The resulting network thus indicates the functional connectivity between brain regions within a certain condition. To overcome possible artefacts of differing lengths of the amplitude time-series \u2013 for example, the task consisted of more calm-go trials than angry no-go trials \u2013 we used a bootstrap approach. Each amplitude time-series was restricted to have a maximum length of 16 (the theoretical maximum number of correct trials of the condition with the lowest number of trials, 4 trials\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 runs). At every bootstrap iteration we sampled 16 data points from the amplitude time-series of conditions with more than 16 trials. With these resampled amplitude time-series we constructed the network. We repeated the resampling and network construction 1000 times and averaged the functional connectivity estimates (i.e. the correlations between ROIs within a condition) over these 1000 iterations. This resulted in an \u2018average\u2019 network for each condition for each subject. \n\nTo assess the resulting functional connectivity networks for each condition we looked at a measure of the relative importance of the ROIs (i.e.   nodes  ) within a network, termed   centrality   ( ). A node\u2019s centrality can be interpreted as the relative importance of the node within the network. Mathematically, it is the weighted sum of all the correlations between that node and the other nodes. In terms of a functional connectivity network (with the ROIs being nodes and the correlations between ROIs the weighted edges), a high level of centrality means that this ROI has a higher number and/or stronger correlations with the other nodes in the network. High centrality thus means that this region is more strongly functionally connected and/or has more functional connections with the other nodes. We calculated degree centrality and shortest path length for each ROI within each average network, resulting in an estimate of the importance of a region for each condition and each subject. These estimates were entered as dependent variables in a linear mixed model with Risk group as between-subjects factor, Emotion and Trial-Type as within-subjects factors and a random intercept over subjects. Analyses were performed separately for each ROI, similar to the ROI analyses in the previous section. \n\nTo further specify if differences in centrality are due to an overall increase of connections or due to large differences in the connectivity strength of specific connections, we performed the same analysis on binarized correlation matrices using different correlation thresholds (  r  \u202f>\u202f0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, or 0.9). This method is useful to filter out the influence of small/weak links within the network. As thresholds are determined somewhat arbitrarily, we follow the convention that multiple thresholds are used (see  ). In the binarized network all correlations below the threshold (i.e. sub-threshold) were set to zero, all the supra-threshold correlations were set to 1. The number of incoming supra-threshold connections was taken as the dependent variable. \n\nTo visualize the connectivity patterns, we plotted the graphs for each of the six conditions for both risk groups. Network analyses were performed using the R-package   qgraph   ( ), centrality measures were calculated using the method by   as implemented in   qgraph  . \n\nTo correct for inflated type I error rates across our ROI analyses for each of the 8 regions we used Bonferroni correction on the number of ROIs (\u03b1\u202f=\u202f0.05/8\u202f=\u202f0.0063; trends \u03b1\u202f=\u202f0.0125). For consistency, p-values in the text are uncorrected values. To show the specificity of our ROI and connectivity analyses we performed these analyses again using control regions where task effects weren\u2019t expected. Results of these analyses are shown in  . \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioural results \n  \nThe analyses showed a difference between the target emotional expression in participants\u2019 false alarm rates (main effect of Emotion:   F  (2, 64)\u202f=\u202f6.058,   p  \u202f=\u202f.004). Post hoc paired samples   t  -tests showed more false alarms in response to angry non-targets relative to calm non-targets (  t  (33)\u202f=\u202f\u22122.476,   p  \u202f=\u202f.019), and more false alarms to happy non-targets in comparison to calm non-targets (  t  (33)\u202f=\u202f\u22123.610,   p  \u202f=\u202f.001;  a). The number of miss trials differed marginally between emotions (  p  \u202f=\u202f.065). Post-hoc tests showed that more misses occurred in angry trials than in calm trials (  t  (33)\u202f=\u202f2.226,   p\u202f=  \u202f.033). No difference was found between the groups (  p  \u202f=\u202f.600) in the number of miss trials. Subsequent analyses of reaction times showed a similar main effect of Emotion on hit trials (  F  (2, 64)\u202f=\u202f4.863,   p  \u202f=\u202f.011), due to faster responses to angry (  t  (33)\u202f=\u202f2.392,   p  \u202f=\u202f.023) and happy (  t  (33)\u202f=\u202f3.128,   p  \u202f=\u202f.004) compared to calm trials. Reaction times for false alarms differed between emotions (  F  (2, 54)\u202f=\u202f3.334,   p  \u202f=\u202f.043), due to faster responses to happy faces than angry faces (  t  (29)\u202f=\u202f\u22122.071,   p  \u202f=\u202f.047;  b). No differences were found when comparing the emotional to calm stimuli, suggesting that the heightened false alarm rate in the emotional conditions was not due to a speed accuracy trade-off. No differences were found between risk-taking groups for any of the behavioural or reaction time indices.   \nHit and false alarm responses per emotion (a) proportion of hits and false alarms, (b) reaction times for hit and false alarm trials. \n  Fig. 2   \n\n\n### Imaging results \n  \n#### Whole brain analysis \n  \nInitial whole brain analyses (FWE cluster corrected,   Z  \u202f>\u202f3.1,   p\u202f  <\u202f.05) confirmed that regions previously implicated in go/no-go and emotional task performance were also activated in our sample. For the no-go > go contrast, clusters of activation were found in the temporal cortex, dorso- and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex and the dorso-anterior cingulate cortex ( , coordinates in  ). For the emotional (happy\u202f+\u202fangry)\u202f>\u202fcalm contrast, one cluster of activation was found in the temporal occipital fusiform cortex ( , coordinates in  ).   shows an overview of the a-priori ROIs (blue) and the actual activation values in our sample (red, FWE cluster-wise   p\u202f  <\u202f.05). For the emotional\u202f>\u202fcalm contrast no overlap was found. For the no-go\u202f>\u202fgo contrast overlap between a-priori ROIs concentrated on the amygdala.   \nWhole brain activation for the no-go\u202f>\u202fgo contrast (FWE cluster corrected, Z\u202f>\u202f3.1,   p  \u202f<\u202f.05) showing activation in the right temporal cortex, the right dorso- and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, right parietal cortex and the right dorso-anterior cingulate cortex.

All coordinates are in MNI space (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article). \n  Fig. 5   \n\n\n#### Region-of-interest analysis \n  \nFurther examination targeting the a priori ROIs revealed differences in the magnitude of activation between go and no-go trials in the right IFG (  F  (1, 160)\u202f=\u202f9.593,   p  \u202f=\u202f.002), and in the right amygdala at trend level (  F  (1, 160)\u202f=\u202f6.383,   p  \u202f=\u202f.012). In these regions activation was greater during no-go trials, which required higher levels of cognitive control, than during go trials. \n\nAnalyses also showed a bilateral interaction effect of Trial Type and Emotion in the left ventral striatum (  F  (2, 160)\u202f=\u202f3.367,   p  \u202f=\u202f.037) and right ventral striatum (  F  (2, 160)\u202f=\u202f3.536,   p  \u202f=\u202f.031). While it did not meet the Bonferroni adjusted p-value, it did fall within uncorrected thresholds. We tentatively report the results here as Bonferroni corrections are known to be conservative when tests are correlated ( ), similar effects were found bilaterally, and the findings are in line with previous research demonstrating that the ventral striatum is known to play an important role in reward processing (e.g.  ). Post hoc   t  -tests showed this was due to greater activation during happy no-go than happy go trials in right/left ventral striatum (right ventral striatum:   t  (33)\u202f=\u202f\u22122.650,   p  \u202f=\u202f.012; left ventral striatum:   t  (33)\u202f=\u202f\u22122.180,   p  \u202f=\u202f.037). No trial type differences were found for the calm or angry conditions in these areas. With regards to risk-taking groups the main effects of Emotion and Trial Type, as well as the interactions between these effects did not differ between the groups. Estimated marginal means and standard errors are displayed in  .   \nEstimated Marginal Means of the activation of each region-of-interest (amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), dorsal- and ventral striatum). Standard Errors are in brackets. \n  Table 5   \n\n\n#### Connectivity analysis \n  \nAnalyses of functional connectivity revealed a three-way Emotion by Trial Type by Risk Group interaction in the dorsal striatum (Left dorsal striatum:   F  (2,160)\u202f=\u202f5.198;   p  \u202f=\u202f.006; Right dorsal striatum:   F  (2,160)\u202f=\u202f5.233;   p  \u202f=\u202f.006). Further inspection of these effects within the risk-taking groups shows that the Emotion by Trial Type interaction is reversed for the high risk-taking group as compared to the low risk-taking group (see   and  ,  ). For participants in the low risk-taking group the dorsal striatum has lower centrality in the calm go trials compared to the calm no-go trials, while centrality scores where lower for emotional no-go trials than go trials. This effect is reversed for participants in the high risk-taking group: they showed lower centrality in the calm no-go trials than go trials, and the centrality of the dorsal striatum increased as the emotional demands of the task increased (i.e. from emotional go to no-go trials). This effect appeared stronger for angry than happy trials. The same three-way interaction effect was observed for the shortest path length (left dorsal striatum:   F  (2,160)\u202f=\u202f5.575;   p  \u202f=\u202f.005; right dorsal striatum:   F  (2,160)\u202f=\u202f5.552;   p  \u202f=\u202f.005), corroborating our degree centrality findings, where higher centrality is associated with shorter path lengths. Marginal means are displayed in  .   \nEstimated Marginal Means of the centrality values of each region-of-interest (amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), dorsal- and ventral striatum). Standard Errors are in brackets. \n  Table 6     \nMean centrality scores of the dorsal striatum (left and right) split by Trial Type (go, no-go) and Emotion (calm, happy, angry) for both risk-taking groups.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article). \n  Fig. 7     \nEstimated Marginal Means of the shortest path length values of the dorsal striatum. Standard Errors are in brackets. \n  Table 7   \n\nTo pinpoint if the differences in centrality scores in the left and right dorsal striatum are due to a few stronger connections or due to a smaller increase in many connections, we performed additional analyses on binarized networks using different thresholds. For the binarized networks we see the same three-way interaction with correlation thresholds between 0.2 and 0.45 for the right dorsal striatum, and for thresholds between 0.3 and 0.5 for the left dorsal striatum. This indicates that the number of incoming connections with a correlation strength between these numbers are driving the centrality differences. Appendix B shows the average connection strength of the connections between the left and right dorsal striatum with the other ROIs for the Emotion, Trial Type and Risk-taking groups. There is no indication that one specific connection is driving the centrality differences, but that it is more of an overall increase in connectivity strength of multiple ROIs. As can be seen for example in the left dorsal striatum, the higher centrality differences between the risk-taking groups in the angry no-go condition are driven by the amygdala (strength from approximately 0.20 to 0.45) and by the increased connection between the dorsal striatum and right IFG and ventral striatal areas (from approximately 0.40 to 0.52). A supplementary analysis where we subsequently left out one of the ROIs connecting to the dorsal striatum and repeated the centrality analysis, showed that the ventral striatal areas were most important in driving the centrality differences. The IFG (bilateral) and left amygdala were most important after that, while the right amygdala was least important. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study we used an emotional go/no-go paradigm to investigate the effect of salient appetitive and aversive emotional information on cognitive control in a group of high risk-taking and a group of low risk-taking adolescents. Consistent with prior work using a similar paradigm (e.g.  ;  ), we show that emotional cues decreased levels of cognitive control. While analysis of activation in our   a priori   regions of interest did not conclusively demonstrate differences between the risk-taking groups, analyses of functional connectivity did reveal differences, specifically in the interactions between the dorsal striatum and other regions. Our findings suggest that variance in fronto-striatal circuitry may underlie the observed individual differences in risk-taking behaviour. \n\n### The influence of emotional cues on cognitive control \n  \nThe behavioural data showed that when the emotional demands of the task were high, participants made more inhibitory errors. These behavioural effects did not differ between the risk-taking groups. The results suggest that both positive and negative emotional information disrupt adolescents\u2019 ability to inhibit a prepotent behavioural response. This is however not the case for neutral emotional information. Previous work in adolescents has shown that appetitive stimuli, (i.e., happy faces) facilitate approach responses and decrease reaction times ( ). Consequently, adolescents are often unable to override this strong approach motivation, leading to behavioural errors in the case of a go/no-go paradigm such as the one used in our study. A growing body of evidence suggests that adolescents also show decreased performance when confronted with negatively-valenced stimuli ( ;  ;  ;  ). While much of this previous work has focused on fearful or threatening faces, our results show that this is also the case for negatively valenced approach emotions, such as anger, evidenced by the increased errors and faster responses in response to angry compared to calm faces. This finding suggests that both positively and negatively valenced approach stimuli disrupt inhibitory control. However, there may be situations in which the effects of heightened emotional arousal during adolescence can be beneficial. Recent work suggests that adolescents\u2019 increased sensitivity to rewards enables them to achieve adult levels of simple forms of cognitive control when offered an incentive to do so ( ), but not for more complex forms (Insel et al., under review). In our sample the observed behavioural effects under emotional conditions did not differ between the low and high risk-taking groups. This failure to find a behavioural effect could be due to all participants in our relatively small sample generally performing well on the task and making few errors, thus leaving little room for individual differences in performance. \n\n\n### Neural correlates of emotional cognitive control \n  \nEffects of emotional information on cognitive control were also visible at a neural level. Activation in the right IFG was greater for non-target (no-go) than target stimuli, and a similar effect was found at trend level in the right amygdala. These results are in line with previous work, and consistent with proposed models of adolescent inhibitory control. Numerous studies have confirmed the role of the IFG in the suppression of response tendencies in both emotional and neutral contexts, as well as highlighting developmental shifts in this ability, with adolescents often showing particularly strong prefrontal recruitment compared to adults (e.g.  ;  ;  ). The observed trend-level increased recruitment of the amygdala in our study may be due to the heightened importance of the expressed facial emotions during no-go trials, as the content of the facial expressions (whether calm, happy or angry) then signifies the need for a change in dominant behaviour. This would be in line with the crucial role of the amygdala in the processing of emotional cues ( ;  ;  ), as well as signalling the salience and relevance of (social) stimuli ( ).   have suggested that this is particularly the case during adolescence, when hormonal changes during puberty result in the amygdala playing a vital role in the evaluation and weighting of specifically social stimuli, resulting in an increased relevance of social signals such as facial emotions. \n\nAt an uncorrected threshold of   p\u202f  <\u202f.05, we also observed an interaction between Emotion and Trial Type in the ventral striatum. Though this effect should be interpreted with caution, it may be explained by the increased salience of emotions during no-go trials. The effect appeared to be driven by a stronger striatal response to happy non-target than happy target faces. The ventral striatum plays an important role in motivated behaviour, especially during the anticipation and attainment of reward ( ;  ;  ), suggesting that the increased relevance of happy faces during non-target trials resulted in greater activation in our sample. Some recent work has also shown striatal activation in response to aversive outcomes, such as negative social feedback ( ), or the administration of an aversive liquid ( ) or auditory stimulus ( ), indicating a general sensitivity of this region to valenced stimuli, not just to reward. We did not observe a difference between target and non-target trials for angry faces. This suggests that the type of stimulus used may be an important, with negative facial expressions not eliciting significant striatal responses. This suggestion is supported by previous work using fearful and happy facial emotions ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Differences in functional connectivity networks between risk-taking groups \n  \nFronto-striatal circuitry has been identified as critical to goal-directed and motivated behaviour in both adolescents and adults ( ;  ). Previous work examining the inhibition of approach responses to appetitive stimuli has suggested that the functional organisation of the fronto-striatal network increases during adolescence and into adulthood, and that during adolescence the ventral-dorsal striatal coupling within this network is stronger than during adulthood ( ). Other work has shown that viewing emotional stimuli can reduce connectivity in cognitive control networks ( ). In this study we used graph-theoretical measures to examine functional connectivity networks. This enabled us to succinctly summarize the properties of the functional networks and identify the influence of brain regions under different conditions of the experiment. As opposed to more traditional methods, where every connection in a network is analysed separately, the graph-theoretical approach thus allows identification of the properties of an entire network and its most important brain regions. By using this method, we were able to establish differences between the risk-taking groups that were not visible when analysing each of the ROIs separately. \n\nOur analyses suggest there are differences between high and low risk-taking adolescents in the recruitment of fronto-striatal networks when regulating behaviour in emotional contexts. As the inhibitory control demands increase within emotional contexts (i.e. happy and angry no-go vs go trials), the centrality of the dorsal striatum increases in the high risk-taking group, and this is accompanied by shorter path lengths within the network. These effects are reversed in the low risk-taking group. Though previous work has often focussed on the role of the ventral striatum during adolescence, our findings suggest that the dorsal striatum may play a central role in emotion regulation during this period. The dorsal striatum is strongly interconnected with motor and higher cortical association areas in frontal and parietal regions, while the ventral striatum shows strong connections with regions involved in emotional processing such as the ventral prefrontal cortex, amygdala and anterior cingulate ( ). The dorsal striatum is often associated with learning and habit formation ( ), but has also been identified as a convergence point for signals from prefrontal cognitive control regions and the ventral striatum during goal-directed, motivated behaviour ( ;  ). Our findings are in line with this model, and suggest that when regulating both positive and negative emotionally salient cues, this role of the dorsal striatum may be of particular importance in those adolescents more prone to risk-taking behaviour. The increased centrality scores in the dorsal striatum were due to greater interconnections with other regions in the high risk-taking group (also reflected by shorter path lengths), and not due to changes in (a small number of) specific connections within the network (as is shown in  ). Therefore, the increased centrality may reflect greater engagement of fronto-striatal networks from the dorsal striatum when correctly suppressing responses to emotional stimuli. As no differences were observed between the groups in behavioural responses, it seems that the adolescents in the high risk-taking group may require greater coordination within the fronto-striatal network through the dorsal striatum to achieve the same level of performance as low risk-takers. \n\n\n### Limitations and conclusions \n  \nA number of limitations of the present study must be noted. Risk-taking groups were defined based on CCT performance, and not on reports of actual risk-taking behaviours. Previous work has however shown that performance on risk-taking tasks is related to real-world engagement in risk-taking behaviours ( ), as well as demonstrating a positive correlation between self-reported inhibitory control and behavioural measures of inhibition in the presence of emotionally salient stimuli ( ). However, further research is needed to confirm these relationships for the behavioural task used in our study. As our sample comprised only adolescents, further work examining children and adults is needed to determine if the observed effects are adolescent-specific. Previous work comparing performance on a variant of the emotional Go-Nogo task in children, adolescents and adults suggests that this may indeed be the case ( ). Finally, while not unusual for fMRI research, the size of the risk-taking groups in our sample was relatively small. Though by selecting participants from a larger sample based on their risk-taking behaviour we were able to create more homogeneous groups than would be expected if participants had been recruited from the general population, thereby increasing the ability to examine the differential effects of high and low levels of risk-taking. Our sample size was largely influenced by the fact that many participants in our longitudinal study had braces, and therefore were not suitable for participation in MRI research. This constraint is important to consider when working with adolescent samples, and oversampling may be required when aiming to select specific groups of participants. \n\nIn conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that both appetitive and aversive emotional cues lead to impairments in inhibitory control during adolescence. While no behavioural differences were observed between the risk-taking groups, functional connectivity analyses revealed differences at a neural level. The dorsal striatum was shown to play an essential role within the fronto-striatal network in the high risk-taking group when suppressing responses to emotional cues. These findings offer an initial suggestion that variance in fronto-striatal circuitry may underlie individual differences in risk-taking behaviour, though further research is needed to elucidate this relationship. \n\n\n\n## Conflict of Interest \n  \nNone \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6969196, "text_md5": "5bae2ffc46f9ea5390101268e62a2736", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 124], "journal": [125, 142], "publication_year": [144, 148], "title": [159, 259], "keywords": [273, 367], "abstract": [380, 1521], "body": [1530, 51908]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 29729493, "doi": "10.1016/j.dcn.2018.04.007", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6969196", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6969196"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6969196\">6969196</a>", "list_title": "PMC6969196  Neural substrates of the influence of emotional cues on cognitive control in risk-taking adolescents"}

In addition, a small but growing number of studies has shown that it also contributes to the resolution of response conflicts. It is less clear how these two functions are related, and how they are affected by hippocampal lesions in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Previous studies suggested that conflict stimuli might be better remembered, but whether the hippocampus is critical for supporting this interaction between conflict processing and memory formation is unknown. Here, we tested 19 patients with MTLE due to hippocampal sclerosis and 19 matched healthy controls. Participants performed a face-word Stroop task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) followed by a recognition task for the faces. We tested whether memory performance and activity in brain regions implicated in long-term memory were modulated by conflict during encoding, and whether this differed between MTLE patients and controls. In controls, we largely replicated previous findings of improved memory for conflict stimuli. While MTLE patients showed response time slowing during conflict trials as well, they did not exhibit a memory benefit. In controls, neural activity of conflict resolution and memory encoding interacted within a hippocampal region of interest. Here, left hippocampal recruitment was less efficient for memory performance in incongruent trials than in congruent trials, suggesting an intrahippocampal competition for limited resources. They also showed an involvement of precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex during conflict resolution. Both effects were not observed in MTLE patients, where activation of the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex instead predicted later memory. Further research is needed to find out whether our findings reflect widespread functional reorganization of the episodic memory network due to hippocampal dysfunction. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOnly a small proportion of our experiences is transferred into long-term memory. How long-term memory encoding interacts with cognitive control and which brain areas support their relationship has been studied, but many questions remain ( ;  ). \n\nIn explicit learning tasks, attention improves memory encoding. Conversely, explicit memory performance deteriorates when subjects perform a demanding secondary task ( ;  ). This suggests that cognitive control and memory encoding recruit similar resource-limited neurocognitive processes in frontal and parietal regions ( ). By contrast, in implicit learning tasks, even highly demanding tasks which rely on brain structures that support memory functions may improve memory encoding ( ). For example, a task-switching paradigm caused impaired memory for task-relevant but improved memory for task-irrelevant information ( ). This suggests that memory performance depends on the selectivity of attention, i.e. in the context of task-switching, the ability to maintain a stable task set and to effectively shield the relevant stimuli from distraction. \n\nAn influential theory of conflict monitoring and cognitive control postulates that conflict in information processing signals reinforcement of top-down control of attention to the current task, which helps resolving conflict ( ). This theory further assumes that while the anterior cingulate cortex provides the conflict signal, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) underlies cognitive control mechanisms that enhance attention to task-relevant stimuli ( ). As a result, stimuli that are presented with incongruent distractors should trigger enhanced selective attention and improve memory encoding of the relevant stimulus. We tested this hypothesis in a previous study that combined a face-word Stroop paradigm with a delayed incidental memory task ( ). Trial-unique male and female faces were overlaid with congruent or incongruent distractor words (the words \u201cman\u201d or \u201cwoman\u201d). This study showed that processing incongruent trials elicited behavioral costs (i.e., longer reaction times), but also improved later memory performance for the relevant stimulus. Conflicts induced activation of a common cognitive control network, including dlPFC and precuneus, and recruitment of these areas was associated with a memory benefit for face stimuli in conflict trials. Furthermore, functional coupling between these areas and the medial temporal lobe was associated with improved memory of incongruent items. These results suggest that prefrontal and parietal brain regions support control processes and exert a top-down modulation of hippocampus mediated memory encoding, highlighting the hippocampus as a crucial link between response conflict resolution and memory encoding. \n\nIn a series of studies, we recently investigated the role of the hippocampus in higher-order cognitive control processes such as response conflict resolution. We found that in healthy participants, the left hippocampus is recruited during the resolution of response conflicts ( ). Patients with a mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) due to hippocampal sclerosis had an impaired conflict resolution performance ( ). In these patients, we further observed a reduced recruitment of the left hippocampus that contributed to the deterioration in performance ( ). These studies suggest that the hippocampus is indeed required for the resolution of cognitive response conflicts. However, whether and how these effects relate to the memory function of the hippocampus remains unclear. Specifically, it is still an open question whether hippocampal dysfunction in MTLE patients affects the interaction between conflict resolution and memory encoding. \n\nHere, we employed the previously established paradigm by   in MTLE patients and healthy controls to further explore the interaction between conflict resolution processes and memory encoding. First, we tested whether stimuli that evoke a response conflict are subsequently better remembered than control stimuli in a delayed incidental memory task and whether this effect differs between controls and MTLE patients. If cognitive control mechanisms recruited during response conflict resolution promote memory encoding ( ) and MTLE patients exhibit reduced conflict resolution performance ( ), one would expect them to also show a reduced memory benefit for conflict stimuli. Second, we tested whether brain regions recruited during response conflict resolution predicted subsequent memory performance. In our previous study, we found increased functional coupling between prefrontal and parietal conflict processing regions on the one hand and the medial temporal lobe on the other hand in healthy participants ( ) which we interpreted as a top-down modulation of hippocampal memory encoding. In the present study, applying the same paradigm in healthy controls and hippocampus-lesioned patients allowed us to test whether conflict processing specifically provided by the hippocampus further contributes to improved subsequent memory performance. We predicted that a reduced conflict-induced hippocampal recruitment due to medial temporal lobe dysfunction affects the memory benefit for conflict stimuli. We further explored whether functional connectivity of the hippocampus differs between MTLE patients and healthy controls. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \n N  \u00a0=\u00a022 patients with MTLE according to International League Against Epilepsy criteria ( ) participated in the study. These patients are identical with those from our previous study ( ). Two patients were excluded from the study due to their extremely low accuracies in the Stroop task. One additional patient did not remember any faces and was excluded as well. The final group consisted of 19 patients (age: 45.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.7 years; 8 females; age at seizure onset: 29.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.2 years; disease duration: 15.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.5 years). All patients underwent neurological examination, EEG and structural MRI as part of their clinical diagnostic procedure. Based on EEG and seizure semiology, 17 patients were diagnosed with unilateral MTLE (left MTLE:   n  \u00a0=\u00a07; right MTLE:   n  \u00a0=\u00a010), two patients had a bilateral MTLE. Nine patients received antiepileptic drug (AED) monotherapy, 10 patients were on polytherapy (for AED dosages, please see supplemental patient characteristics in Table S1). Patients with multifocal epilepsy, comorbid neurological diseases or severe psychiatric disorders were excluded. \n\nIn addition to patients,   n  \u00a0=\u00a019 age matched healthy controls participated in the study (age: 45.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.5 years; 9 females). Subjects with a neurological or psychiatric disease, a central nervous system-active medication or cerebral lesions were excluded. \n\nAll participants gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the \u00c4rztekammer Westfalen-Lippe and University of Muenster (reference 2016 - 004 - f - S). \n\nAs described previously ( ) the structural MRI scans received concordant evaluations by two radiologists following a standardized protocol to assess signs of hippocampal sclerosis ( ). Healthy subjects did not show any signs of hippocampal sclerosis. In MTLE patients, radiological findings of individual MRI scans are described in the Supplemental Results (Table S1). Results of the volumetric analyses confirmed the qualitative findings of the radiologists with respect to the lateralization of the hippocampal lesion (see Supplemental Results, Table S3). \n\n\n### Experimental procedure \n  \nThe participants underwent functional MRI scanning using an adapted version of the face-word Stroop paradigm from a previous fMRI study ( ). This version of the task featured conflict and non-conflict trials, but no neutral trials (faces overlaid with an unrelated word) in order to reduce overall memory demands for this sample including patients. \n\n#### Familiarization and training \n  \nPrior to the MRI session, the participants performed a familiarization task for all face stimuli that were later presented in the face-word Stroop task. A pre-exposure to the stimuli of the fMRI task appeared necessary for two reasons. First, MTLE patients are significantly impaired in episodic memory ( ). We aimed to avoid floor effects and moreover to equalize baseline levels so that conflict modulation can be observed. Second, as there is an habituation of hippocampal response to novelty ( ), a familiarization phase avoids group differences for this effect. How pre-exposure may further affect interpretation will be addressed in the discussion. \n\nDuring familiarization, the face stimuli were displayed three times in a randomized order for 2000\u00a0ms each with a stimulus-onset-asynchrony (SOA) of 3000\u00a0ms. This procedure was chosen to avoid effects of novelty and floor effects during the later memory task. To ensure continuous attention, subjects had to indicate (via left vs. right button-press) whether they had seen the current face before or not. Stimuli were shown in the center of a white screen, and a black fixation dot was presented throughout the entire task. After familiarization, participants performed 20 separate training trials of the face-word Stroop task. These stimuli were different from those presented in the fMRI task. \n\n\n#### Face-word Stroop task \n  \nThe task comprised face-word stimuli consisting of male and female faces [Glasgow Face Database,  ], overlaid by the words \u201cman\u201d or \u201cwoman\u201d (in German language). These words could be either congruent or incongruent with the sex of the face ( A). The paradigm consisted of the 120 faces (60 males and 60 females) previously presented in the familiarization task. Faces were displayed for 1500\u00a0ms in the center of a white screen. We used an event-related design in order to identify separate trial-related Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses. Trial onsets randomly varied with a pseudo-exponentially distributed SOA of 5000\u00a0ms (75%), 7500\u00a0ms (17%) and 10,000\u00a0ms (8%). The words were displayed in red ink superimposed on the faces. Both trial types were presented in a randomized order and occurred with a probability of 50%. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two stimulus sets. Stimuli that were congruent in one group of subjects were incongruent in the other group. Subjects had to indicate whether a face was male or female by pressing the left or right mouse button (button assignments were counterbalanced across participants in each group). Throughout the entire paradigm, a black fixation dot was displayed in the middle of the face (and right below the word) to ensure accurate fixation.   \nFace-word Stroop task and behavioral results. (A) In the face-word Stroop task, each trial consisted of a face overlaid by the words \u201cman\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d that were either congruent or incongruent with the sex of the face. ITI, inter-trial interval. (B) Mean of response times (left) and mean of response time differences (right), overlaid with single-subject results. (C) Mean of the response accuracies (left) and response accuracy differences (right), overlaid with single-subject results. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n#### Incidental memory task \n  \nAbout 30\u201345\u00a0min after the face-word Stroop task, an incidental memory task of to the previously seen faces was conducted outside of the MRI scanner. All 120 faces that had been shown in the face-word Stroop task and 40 novel faces were presented in a random order on a standard laptop computer. The faces were displayed in the center of a white screen for 2000\u00a0ms, followed by an inter-trial interval of 2000\u00a0ms (SOA\u00a0=\u00a04000\u00a0ms). Subjects were asked to indicate whether they had seen the face before (during the fMRI task or the familiarization) or not by pressing one of four buttons (4: \u201cdefinitely old\u201d, 3: \u201cprobably old\u201d, 2: \u201cprobably new\u201d, 1: \u201cdefinitely new\u201d). We tested whether this rating scale was used differently by MTLE patients and healthy controls to exclude the possibility of strategic differences. In the supplement, Fig. S1 shows the number of responses for each response category, separately for target items and distractor items as well as for controls and MTLE patients. In a multivariate ANOVA, \u201cgroup\u201d (MTLE patients vs. controls) did not affect the number of responses for the different response categories (Pillai's Trace;   V  \u00a0=\u00a00.2,   F   (8, 29)\u00a0=\u00a01.0,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.45), arguing against a differential use of the rating scale in both groups. \n\n\n\n### MR image acquisition \n  \nMR images were collected using a 3T Achieva Philips MR scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, NL) equipped with a six-channel head coil. During the face-word Stroop task, a total of 294 T2*-weighted gradient echo-planar images (EPI) were acquired (TR\u00a0=\u00a02500\u00a0ms; TE\u00a0=\u00a035\u00a0ms; 36 axial slices; interleaved acquisition in ascending direction; FOV\u00a0=\u00a0230\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0230\u00a0mm ; matrix\u00a0=\u00a064\u00a0\u00d7\u00a063; slice-thickness\u00a0=\u00a03.6\u00a0mm; no interslice gap; flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0). The first 6 vol were discarded. The imaging volumes were tilted upwards by 15\u00b0 from the AC-PC-plane in order to reduce distortions and signal dropouts in the anterior temporal lobes. \n\nAdditionally, an anatomical 3D T1-weighted (T1w) turbo field echo (TFE) sequence (repetition time [TR]\u00a0=\u00a07.4\u00a0ms; echo time [TE]\u00a0=\u00a03.4\u00a0ms; inversion time [TI]\u00a0=\u00a0900\u00a0ms; flip angle\u00a0=\u00a09\u00b0; 176 slices; matrix\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0224; field of view [FOV]\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0224\u00a0mm ; slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mm) was acquired. To investigate changes in medial temporal lobe structures, paracoronal T2-weighted (T2w) images perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampi were acquired using a turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence (TR\u00a0=\u00a05196\u00a0ms; TE\u00a0=\u00a0118\u00a0ms; parallel imaging factor [SENSE]\u00a0=\u00a01.5; turbo factor\u00a0=\u00a026; 38 slices; FOV\u00a0=\u00a0200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0200mm ; acquisition matrix\u00a0=\u00a0372\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0312; slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0mm; slice gap\u00a0=\u00a00.2\u00a0mm). \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Behavioral data \n  \nMean response times (RT), including only correct responses, and accuracy of responses in the face-word Stroop task were analyzed with two-way mixed analyses of variances (ANOVAs) with \u201ccongruency\u201d (incongruent vs. congruent) as a within-subject factor and \u201cgroup\u201d (healthy controls vs. MTLE patients) as a between-subjects factor. \n\nMemory performance was analyzed as follows. First, we sought to replicate the previous finding of conflict-enhanced memory. As in our previous study, we contrasted the number of \u201cdefinitely old\u201d (remembered) with all other ratings (forgotten) for target stimuli, reflecting a high confident recognition measure (putatively mainly based on recollection). In an additional analysis, we counted previously presented stimuli rated as either \u201cdefinitely old\u201d or \u201cprobably old\u201d as remembered, and faces rated as \u201cprobably new\u201d and \u201cdefinitely new\u201d as forgotten, reflecting a more global measure of both recollection and familiarity. We also assessed false alarm rates (distractor items rates as \u201cdefinitely old\u201d or \u201cprobably old\u201d). In all analyses, two-way mixed ANOVAs were conducted to investigate main effects of congruency and group as well as their interaction. \n\nWe additionally analyzed response times for remembered target stimuli (\u201cdefinitely old\u201d and \u201cprobably old\u201d). These results are presented in the supplement. \n\nWe also tested for correlations between Stroop task performance and retrieval rates using non-parametric Kendall's tau, as this parameter is particularly suitable for small groups analyses. We corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction (p-value/2). The results are presented in the supplement. \n\n\n#### FMRI data preprocessing and analysis \n  \nThe fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12; University College, London, UK) using the same procedure as applied previously ( ). In short, functional EPIs were realigned, normalized, resliced and smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with 8\u00a0mm FWHM. We verified the accuracy of normalization in patients with the greatest abnormalities in the medial temporal lobe. Correction of normalization parameters was not necessary. \n\nBased on our a-priori hypothesis that conflict-induced memory improvement is directly mediated by hippocampal recruitment, in the fMRI analysis, we focused on the effects of congruency and the interaction between congruency and memory within a hippocampal ROI. If significant, we further report main effects of memory and group as well as the interaction \u201ccongruency x memory x group\u201d. To not miss any effects outside the hippocampus, we also tested for these effects in a whole-brain analysis. \n\nIn follow-up analyses, we extracted beta-values from significant activation clusters and performed within and between group comparisons, respectively. Please note that such post-hoc comparisons are not corrected for multiple comparisons. They are presented for illustrative purposes and they do not allow inferences. \n\nThe first level general linear model (GLM) included four regressors (and their temporal derivates) related to the experimental conditions and six movement regressors derived from the realignment procedure. Due to the overall high memory performance, the experimental conditions (congruent, incongruent) were divided into trials with faces that were recollected with high confidence vs. faces that were not recollected with high confidence. \n\nThus, in the fMRI analysis, we contrasted stimuli rated as \u201cdefinitely old\u201d with all other ratings, corresponding to an fMRI measure that is putatively mainly based on recollection, as in our previous study ( ). In the supplement, we also report fMRI results based on first-level models in which we contrasted remembered (\u201cdefinitely old\u201d and \u201cprobably old\u201d) with forgotten (\u201cprobably new\u201d and \u201cdefinitely new\u201d) items. \n\nFirst-level individual contrast images for each of the four experimental conditions were entered into random-effects second-level analyses for the two groups (healthy controls vs. MTLE patients). We applied flexible factorial designs to investigate main effects of \u201ccongruency\u201d (incongruent vs. congruent), \u201cmemory\u201d (recollected with high confidence vs. not recollected with high confidence) and the interaction (congruency x memory) within each group. Additionally, the contrast images from controls and MTLE patients were entered into a common GLM (flexible factorial design) to test for a main effect of \u201cgroup\u201d and for interactions of the two within-subject factors \u201ccongruency\u201d and \u201cmemory\u201d with the between-subjects factor \u201cgroup\u201d (group x congruency, group x memory). \n\nVoxel activations were identified at an initial cluster-forming threshold of   p   < 0.001 and family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level (for whole-brain analyses) or at the voxel-level (for hippocampal ROI analyses), respectively. In the hippocampal ROI analysis, we performed small volume correction for a ROI containing left and right hippocampus as defined by the Automatic Anatomic Labeling (AAL) atlas ( ). In this analysis, MTLE patients with amygdalohippocampectomy were excluded. For the interpretation of activations, we subdivided the hippocampus into an anterior (\u00a0Y \u2265 -21\u00a0mm MNI) and a posterior (Y \u2264 -22\u00a0mm MNI) part ( ). \n\n\n#### Functional connectivity analyses \n  \nWe performed exploratory functional connectivity analyses using the CONN toolbox V18.b ( , RRID:SCR_009550). Functional images were preprocessed using SPM and corrected for noise using the default denoising pipeline ( ). In addition to temporal band-pass filtering (0.008 \u2013 0.09\u00a0Hz), the procedure included linear regression of confounding factors, i.e. effects of no interest from white matter, cerebrospinal fluid and movements (realignment parameters). \n\nThe functional connectivity analysis was a seed-based connectivity measure (seed to voxel) based on bivariate correlational analyses during the task (averaging congruent and incongruent trials). We chose two anatomical seed regions, i.e. left and right hippocampus, based on the ROI in the univariate analysis. First-level connectivity maps representing z-transformed correlation coefficients in the BOLD signal between the seed and each voxel in the brain were entered into a second-level ANOVA, allowing us to investigate differences of hippocampal connectivity between MTLE patients and controls. The statistical threshold was identical to that used in the univariate fMRI analysis (i.e.   p   < 0.05; FWE-corrected at the cluster level with an initial cluster-forming voxel threshold of   p   < 0.001). Analysis and results of regional brain volumes are described in the supplement. \n\n\n\n### Data and code availability \n  \nGroup-level statistical maps are accessible under the following link:  . Behavioral data can be made available via data sharing agreement upon request to the corresponding author. \n\nSoftware used in this study is openly available. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \n#### Face-word Stroop task \n  \nThe results of the Stroop task are shown in  B,C. \n\nWith respect to RT, a mixed ANOVA revealed significant main effects of \u201ccongruency\u201d (incongruent vs. congruent; F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a044.3;   p   < 0.001) and \u201cgroup\u201d (MTLE patients vs controls; F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a04.7;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.037) as well as a significant interaction (group x congruency; F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a04.6;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.039). RT slowing in incongruent compared to congruent trials was found in both healthy subjects (t(18)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22125.4;   p   < 0.001) and MTLE patients (t(18)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22123.9;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.001), confirming robust interference effects in our paradigm. Comparing patients with left MTLE and patients with right MTLE, a mixed ANOVA did neither reveal a main effect of group (F(1,15) < 0.001;   p  \u00a0=\u00a01.0) nor an interaction (group x congruency; F(1,15)\u00a0=\u00a00.01;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.9). \n\nFor response accuracy, a mixed ANOVA showed no significant main effects (congruency: F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a00.5;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.46; group: F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a02.5;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.12) or interaction (group x congruency; F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a00.5;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.51). A mixed ANOVA comparing left and right MTLE patients did not yield a significant main effect of group (F(1,15)\u00a0=\u00a00.4;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.6). \n\nIn sum, in both groups, responses were significantly slower in incongruent trials while accuracy was unaffected. The results indicate conflict effects in both controls and MTLE patients, providing the basis for testing whether memory performance is modulated by conflict-related control processes. \n\n\n#### Incidental delayed memory task \n  \nRetrieval rates are presented in  . Before analysis, we excluded all error trials and misses in the face-word Stroop task. The number of analyzed items did not differ between controls (97%) and MTLE patients (93%; t(36)\u00a0=\u00a01.79;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.082). Notably, false alarm rates (new faces rated as \u201cdefinitely old\u201d or \u201cprobably old\u201d) did not differ between MTLE patients (33%) and controls (34%; t(36)\u00a0=\u00a00.1;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.9).   \nBehavioral results of the retrieval task.

A mixed ANOVA yielded a significant main effect of \u201cgroup\u201d (healthy controls vs. MTLE patients; F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a07.0;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.012) and a trend for an interaction (group x congruency; F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a03.0;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.092) but no significant main effect of conflict (F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a00.2;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.9). Thus, MTLE patients reached lower high confident recognition scores than healthy controls. This was true for both congruent (t(18)\u00a0=\u00a02.1;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.046) and incongruent trials (t(18)\u00a0=\u00a03.2;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.003). Within groups, high confident recognition scores did not differ between congruent and incongruent trials in either controls (t(18)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.3;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.21) or MTLE patients (t(18)\u00a0=\u00a01.2;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.25). Retrieval rates did not differ between right and left MTLE patients (main effect of group: F(1,15)\u00a0=\u00a02.6;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.13) and were independent of congruency (interaction: F(1,15) < 0.1;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.8). \n\nIn a complementary analysis, stimuli were counted as remembered when rated as either \u201cdefinitely old\u201d or \u201cprobably old\u201d (reflecting a low confidence recognition measure and possibly reflecting familiarity). In a mixed ANOVA of this more global memory measure, MTLE patients reached lower scores (main effect of group;   F  (1,36)\u00a0=\u00a06.6;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.015) and the interaction between \u201cgroup\u201d and \u201ccongruency\u201d was significant (  F  (1,36)\u00a0=\u00a05.0;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.032). This indicates that word congruency modulated memory differently in healthy controls and MTLE patients when considering a more global measure of memory. Specifically, healthy controls showed improved retrieval of faces from incongruent compared to congruent trials in healthy controls (81.6% vs. 77.6%;   t  (18)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.5;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.021). By contrast, MTLE patients did not show such memory benefit of incongruent stimuli (65% vs. 66%;   t  (18)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.7;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.5). In incongruent trials, retrieval rates were significantly higher for controls than MTLE patients (  t  (38)\u00a0=\u00a03.0;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.005), while this difference only reached a trend for congruent trials (  t  (30.5)\u00a0=\u00a02.0;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.052). \n\nIn sum, incongruent distractor words in the face-word Stroop task caused typical behavioral costs in terms of RT slowing in both healthy controls and MTLE patients, but familiarity-based recognition scores increased during conflict only in healthy controls. \n\n\n\n### FMRI results \n  \n#### Main effect of congruency \n  \n ROI analysis in the hippocampus  : In line with our main hypothesis and previous work ( ;  ), we first analyzed congruency effects in a ROI consisting of bilateral hippocampus. In healthy controls, we found a small but significant activation increase for incongruent vs. congruent trials in both left posterior hippocampus (MNI \u221230/\u221224/\u221216,   Z  \u00a0=\u00a03.74, p(FWE)\u00a0=\u00a00.036; cluster size\u00a0=\u00a01) and right posterior hippocampus (MNI 28/\u221236/\u22124,   Z  \u00a0=\u00a03.72, p(FWE)\u00a0=\u00a00.038; cluster size\u00a0=\u00a01). No effect in the reverse direction was observed in the hippocampus. In MTLE patients, the same analysis did not reveal a main effect of congruency in the hippocampus. In a mixed ANOVA with MTLE patients and controls, we did neither find main effects of congruency or group nor an interaction (group x congruency) within the hippocampus ROI. \n\n Whole-brain analysis  : In healthy controls, we found several significant clusters of increased activity during incongruent trials (including bilateral insula, bilateral supplementary motor area and cingulate cortex, left precentral gyrus, bilateral middle frontal gyrus, precuneus, caudate nucleus, left putamen;  ,  A). No clusters showed a reverse effect. These clusters largely replicate results of our previous study ( ) and are typical findings in cognitive tasks that require behavioral inhibition ( ).   \nActivation clusters in controls (main effect of congruency). \n  Table 1       \nWhole brain analysis of activations related to response conflict.

(C) Corresponding contrast estimates for the interaction cluster. Error bars show standard error of the mean. \n  Fig. 3   \n\nIn MTLE patients, the same analysis did not yield any significant activation clusters. A mixed ANOVA including controls and patients showed a significant group x congruency interaction in the precuneus spreading to the PCC (MNI peak coordinates: \u22124/\u221258/38; cluster size\u00a0=\u00a0182;   p  (FWE)\u00a0=\u00a00.048;  B). This interaction indicates a reduced conflict-induced activation increase in MTLE patients compared to controls. Post-hoc paired t-tests in this interaction cluster showed increased activation during incongruent relative to congruent trials in healthy subjects (  t  (18)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22124.5;   p   < 0.001) but not in MTLE patients (  t  (18)\u00a0=\u00a01.1;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.27;  C). \n\nIn sum, we found conflict-related activations in an extended frontoparietal network in healthy controls and reduced effects in MTLE patients. \n\n\n#### Subsequent memory effects \n  \n ROI analysis in the hippocampus  : In healthy controls, we did not observe a significant main effect of memory in bilateral hippocampi in an ANOVA with the within-subject factors \u201ccongruency\u201d (congruent vs. incongruent) and \u201cmemory\u201d (recollected with high confidence vs. not recollected with high confidence). Interestingly, however, we found a significant congruency x memory interaction with a peak in the left posterior hippocampus (MNI peak coordinates \u221232/\u221224/\u221216;   Z  \u00a0=\u00a03.81; p(FWE)\u00a0=\u00a00.028; cluster size\u00a0=\u00a04;  A), spreading into anterior hippocampus (max/min Y(mm): \u221220/\u221224). This cluster, which comprises only voxels surviving voxel-level FWE-correction within the hippocampal ROI, was directly adjacent to the area where we found conflict-related activation increase (MNI peak coordinates: \u221230/\u221224/\u221216).   \nBOLD activity related to subsequent memory performance.

In MTLE patients, neither the main effect of memory nor the interaction (congruency x memory) revealed significant activations within the hippocampal ROI. \n\nIn sum, in controls, hippocampal activation was associated with greater memory benefits for faces from congruent trials compared to faces from incongruent trials. \n\n Whole-brain analysis  : We next tested whether other brain regions were predictive of memory success. In healthy controls, the whole-brain analysis did not reveal any activation cluster with either a main effect of memory or an interaction (congruency x memory). \n\nIn MTLE patients, we found an activation cluster comprising the PCC and the precuneus (MNI peak coordinates: 0/\u221252/22, cluster size\u00a0=\u00a0182,   p  (FWE)\u00a0=\u00a00.022,  C) that showed a main effect of memory but no interaction with congruency. \n\nPost-hoc t-tests of the extracted beta values revealed that activation was increased during encoding of later remembered compared to forgotten faces from both congruent (t(18)\u00a0=\u00a02.9   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.01) and incongruent trials (t(18)\u00a0=\u00a03.7   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.002;  D). \n\nThe results indicate that the PCC/precuneus contributed to later memory success in MTLE patients independent of congruency. \n\n\n\n### Functional connectivity results \n  \nWe investigated functional connectivity between activations in hippocampal seeds and each voxel in the brain. For the left hippocampal seed, functional connectivity (over tasks) did not differ between groups. However, MTLE patients showed significantly decreased coupling between right hippocampus and right PCC compared to healthy subjects (MNI 12/\u221244/30; cluster size\u00a0=\u00a0197,   p  (FWE)\u00a0=\u00a00.004;  ). The analysis did not reveal a significant interaction (group x congruency).   \nResults of functional connectivity analysis for the right hippocampal seed.

MTLE, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. \n  Fig. 5   \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe investigated how hippocampal lesions in MTLE patients affect the impact of conflict resolution on memory encoding at a behavioral level and at the level of BOLD responses. Using a previously established face-word Stroop paradigm and an incidental memory task, we tested whether the conflict-induced memory benefit that we had found in healthy subjects ( ) was reduced in MTLE patients. Moreover, we investigated whether recruitment of the hippocampus or other conflict-related brain regions is necessary for a memory benefit of conflict stimuli. \n\nWhile both MTLE patients and healthy controls showed behavioral costs of conflict processing in the Stroop task, only healthy controls exhibited improved memory for incongruent items. Conflict processing was associated with activation of bilateral hippocampus, precuneus and PCC in healthy controls. Conflict-related activation of precuneus and PCC was significantly reduced in MTLE patients compared to controls. Furthermore, activation of precuneus and PCC instead predicted subsequent memory in MTLE patients. Interestingly, in healthy controls, left hippocampal activation was less efficient for memory encoding in case of conflict compared to non-conflict, a seemingly counterintuitive activation pattern. \n\nIn contrast to the auditory Stroop task in our previous studies ( a,  b), in the face-word Stroop task, MTLE patients showed normal response accuracy and increased RT in congruent but not incongruent trials. This discrepancy may be related to the difference between the tasks: Compared to naming the pitch of a tone (as in our previous study), decisions on the sex of a face are more complex and require integrating various kinds of information. As   already stated, this might have attenuated effects of conflict on behavioral measures and also explain why the present results do not perfectly match with our previous findings. \n\nPrevious studies found that the processing of incongruent items improved subsequent memory ( ;  ). Recently,   showed that memory was only enhanced for those incongruent items that were presented after another incongruent trial. These contradictory findings might be explained by different trial orders of congruent and incongruent trials and/or different Stroop trials that were selected for the later memory task. In the present study, the behavioral results in healthy participants indicate a memory benefit for incongruent items, but only when adapting a more global memory measure including high and low confident recognition. Thus, conflict-induced memory benefit seems to depend on task features such as trial composition or which kind of recognition measure is used. \n\nImportantly, no such memory benefit was found in MTLE patients. More specifically, MTLE patients showed reduced memory particularly for incongruent items. As we found impairments of response conflict resolution during an auditory Stroop task in an MTLE patient cohort largely overlapping with the current sample ( ), one may assume that the decreased memory benefit relates to reduced conflict resolution performance of patients. \n\nBased on our previous finding of a reduced conflict-related left hippocampus recruitment in MTLE patients ( ), we hypothesized that the hippocampus itself might contribute to improved memory encoding of incongruent items. Indeed, we found a significant interaction between memory and congruency in the left posterior hippocampus in healthy controls. However, hippocampal activation was actually less pronounced for encoding items from incongruent trials compared to congruent trials. This cluster was close to the region showing conflict-related activation in this study as well as in our previous study that used an auditory Stroop paradigm ( ). This suggests that recruiting the hippocampus for the resolution of response conflicts interferes with its role in memory formation. This finding was unexpected since previous fMRI results found posterior hippocampal recruitment during encoding of repeated stimuli ( ). One explanation might be that it reflects a competition for limited resources between two functions that are both hippocampus-dependent. A similar competition for neural resources in prefrontal cortex has previously been suggested as an explanation for lower memory encoding during a demanding secondary task ( ). Furthermore, converging evidence from animal lesion studies and human fMRI recordings suggest that multiple simultaneously activated memory systems interact in a bidirectionally competitive way ( ). For example, disruption of hippocampal function in rodents enhanced striatal instrumental learning ( ;  ). The theory of a hippocampal competition is also in line with human neuroimaging studies showing that the type of representation that is used for memory or spatial navigation (hippocampal or striatal mediated) affects both performance and activation ( ;  ). \n\nAlternative explanations for the counterintuitive activation pattern in the hippocampus should be taken into account. Considering that participants had performed a familiarization task before the main experiment, it might be plausible that they did not only encode information during the Stroop task but also retrieved the previously presented items, leading to a competition between encoding and retrieval. This notion is supported by evidence suggesting that encoding and retrieval cannot occur at the same time and, again, compete for limited resources ( ;  ). Thus, an increased recruitment of the posterior part of the hippocampus might reflect retrieval success ( ), leading to reduced memory encoding. This interpretation would be in line with the notion that encoding of familiar or repeated stimuli (possibly due to a retrieval component) more strongly relies on posterior hippocampus ( ;  ;  ). Nevertheless, since healthy subjects showed an improved memory for conflict-related stimuli, neural activity in other brain regions must have had an even greater impact on memory encoding. \n\nWe further tested whether activation of other, possibly connected, brain areas could account for the behavioral results. Healthy controls exhibited conflict-related activation clusters in prefrontal and parietal brain regions, largely in line with the results of our previous study ( ). More specifically, activations in the lateral and medial PFC are thought to mediate conflict monitoring and conflict resolution ( ;  ). From a network perspective, controls\u2019 bilateral activation in the anterior insula suggest an involvement of the salience network ( ). This might represent the neural signal which initiates a switch from default mode activity to cognitive control activity ( ). Posterior midline regions, particularly the precuneus, are also involved in cognitive control processes, probably through their role in directing attention ( ;  ). Conflict-related activation in the precuneus and partly the PCC was significantly reduced in MTLE patients. Notably, these functional changes in the recruitment of precuneus/PCC of MTLE patients were not reflected by volumetric changes in these areas (see Supplemental Results, Table S3). The results are largely in line, however, with our functional connectivity results that revealed decreased coupling between the right hippocampal seed and right PCC ( ). This finding is consistent with previous studies showing extratemporal functional changes in MTLE patients, particularly in regions involved in the default mode network (DMN;  ;  ), and, more specifically, a decoupling between hippocampus and other parts of the DMN ( ;  ;  ). \n\nThe reduced effects of congruency mainly in the precuneus and partly the PCC in MTLE patients compared to healthy controls are in line with the behavioral finding that congruency modulated memory performance in controls but not in MTLE patients. However, can functional changes in the precuneus/PCC indeed explain the reduced memory benefit for conflict stimuli in MTLE patients? Precuneus and also PCC have been suggested to be core nodes of the DMN which is active in the absence of a task and associated with internally directed cognition ( ). In contrast, other studies argued against an involvement of the precuneus in the DMN ( ;  ). It is likely that there is a functional differentiation within precuneus and PCC. Whereas the ventral precuneus and ventral PCC (corresponding to Brodmann areas 29/30) shows integration in the DMN, the dorsal precuneus (or Brodmann area 7) and dorsal PCC are more strongly related to brain areas of motor execution and cognitive control ( ;  ,  ). In MTLE patients, functional changes in the precuneus did not show clear restriction to either ventral or dorsal precuneus. Thus, interpretation on the level of functional networks seems equivocal. Instead, there is convincing evidence for a crucial role of the precuneus in episodic memory ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The idea that the role of the precuneus in episodic memory explains the reduced conflict-related memory benefit in MTLE patients is in line with the finding in our previous study that the precuneus was predictive of a conflict-induced memory benefit ( ). Moreover, and most importantly, we found a distinct activation cluster comprising parts of the PCC and the precuneus which predicted retrieval success independent of congruency in MTLE patients. Notably, the precuneus is more strongly related to memory retrieval ( ) which is in line with the idea that subjects did not only encode but also retrieved the faces they had been familiarized before. Functional impairment in the precuneus due to hippocampal damage might reflect (presumably) maladaptive reorganization of memory processes from hippocampus to posterior midline regions which might contribute to episodic memory impairment and deficits in their modulation by cognitive control. This is largely in line with a previous study showing that functional changes in the posterior cingulum were related to memory performance ( ). We speculate that due to changes in precuneus recruitment, memory recall was not modulated by congruency in MTLE patients, leading to similar (additional) encoding efficiency in both trial types. \n\nFrom a broader perspective, the present findings are relevant with regard to a related research line on hippocampal involvement during approach-avoidance conflicts (for review, see  ). For instance, it has been shown that behavioral adaptations in an approach-avoidance conflict paradigm, and in particular the avoidance of threats, was associated with larger activity in the anterior hippocampus of healthy participants ( ). Crucially, behavioral adaptation was impaired in TLE patients, and this did not merely reflect general memory impairments (based on neuropsychological assessment). Moreover, in a recent study, patients with a mesial temporal lobe lesion were impaired in approach-avoidance decision-making but showed recollection of threat memory similar to controls ( ). These findings suggest that hippocampal involvement during approach-avoidance conflict tasks is not necessarily related to memory. In how far hippocampal activity during these particular conflicts is directly contributing to long-term memory is, however, a matter of debate. Specifically, a recent behavioral study ( ) did not find memory improvements in an approach-avoidance conflict task. This is not only challenging the above view, but is also inconsistent with our previous ( ) and current findings in the face-word Stroop task. As discussed by  , this behavioral discrepancy might be explained by differences in the task design (i.e., presence vs. absence of incentive valence; associative vs. item memory) and a ceiling effect due to pre-exposure. Moreover, the interpretation of hippocampal involvement in approach-avoidance conflict tasks is complicated by the incentive valence dimension, which is known to modulate memory formation via the hippocampus ( ). Together, the diverse set of results across different studies and domains support the notion that the hippocampus has a role in both (approach-avoidance) conflict processing and conflict-based memory formation, but the exact relationship between these processes seems to depend on the nature of the paradigm. In the light of this discussion, our observation that hippocampal lesions abolish conflict-induced memory improvements might indicate that an active hippocampus during conflict processing indirectly enhances memory encoding by allowing the conflict-related recruitment of other brain regions, such as the precuneus. \n\nIn the present study, we found reduced BOLD signal in several brain regions in MTLE patients. As patients showed altered conflict-modulation of memory, we interpreted changes of the activation pattern as a dysfunctional process. This is in line with the majority of previous studies showing that activation changes represent a pathological process or an inefficient compensatory attempt in TLE ( ). The situation is even more complex because the BOLD signal depends on neurovascular coupling between neural activity and blood oxygenation (and volume), and this coupling may be substantially altered in epilepsy. Specifically, in epilepsy patients, interictal epileptiform discharges can affect the BOLD signal and thus lead to deviations from linearity in neurovascular coupling ( ;  ). In our study, we reduced the impact of this confound by testing the group differences in the relative activations between two conditions (congruent vs. incongruent). Nevertheless, future studies which allow for a direct measurement of neural activity such as intracranial EEG recordings should be conducted with the same paradigm, ideally after running the experiment via fMRI before electrode implantation. \n\nOur study has several limitations. Our main behavioral outcome measures of the Stroop task were RT and accuracy which we analyzed separately. The results show that RT was clearly modulated by conflict, while accuracy was not affected (ceiling effect), neither in controls nor in patients. This indicates that the present conflict manipulation did not evoke a substantial number of response errors (a reflection of automatic response capture by the irrelevant stimulus), but led to significantly prolonged RTs (a reflection of cognitive control processes to prevent response errors). The low error rate might be related to the fairly simple two-alternative choice (instead of four responses in the regular Stroop task), and the processing of superimposed gender labels might not be as \u201cautomatic\u201d as color-word reading in the regular Stroop task. Having said this, integrating the behavioral data into a diffusion decision model, e.g. see  , could be useful to better characterize the neural and cognitive processes of decision making in the face-word Stroop task (and in comparison to the color-word Stroop task), but this is beyond the scope of the current study. Here, we focused on how memory processes were modulated by previous conflict processing. The precise mechanisms underlying the Stroop effect in different paradigms may be addressed in future studies. Moreover, RT and accuracy assess partly different aspects of conflict processing and the data do not suggest that participants have traded speed for accuracy. \n\nFurthermore, none of the conflict-related activation clusters we found in the whole-brain analysis in healthy controls turned out to be predictive of healthy subjects\u2019 memory performance, neither over both task conditions, nor specifically for faces of incongruent trials. This might be explained by an insufficient study power. Moreover, it might be related to the generally increased retrieval rates in healthy subjects in the present study compared to the previous one ( ). To account for memory deficits in MTLE patients, we extended the learning phase (familiarization), assuming that this may reduce memory encoding demands during the actual Stroop task. Furthermore, the absence of neutral trials (compared to the paradigm in our previous study) possibly reduced the saliency of the conflict condition. Thus, we suspect that changes in the paradigm that were necessary for investigating MTLE patients reduced the effects of congruency on memory and the corresponding BOLD contrasts of healthy subjects. Related to this, the behavioral congruency effect was particularly evident for the true remembered vs. forgotten comparison. However, which type of memory (i.e. hippocampus-dependent episodic details or hippocampus-independent schematic information) is particularly modulated by conflict, cannot be answered by the current study. This might be an interesting step towards a better understanding of conflict-modulation of memory processes. Furthermore, in contrast to the behavioral contrast, the fMRI recollection contrast (high confident vs. not high confident recollection) revealed more reliable effects due to balanced item numbers. Thus, the relation between behavioral and fMRI results is limited. \n\nAnother limitation is that patients with unilateral left and right MTLE as well as bilateral MTLE were involved in the study, so that we cannot infer whether the fMRI results are modulated by epilepsy lateralization. We did not further analyze fMRI results of subgroups due to their small sample sizes. The delay between learning and retrieval task was not identical between subjects but was between 30 and 45\u00a0min. However, the delay randomly varied in all participants and it is unlikely that a systematic error affected group differences. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur study provides first evidence that the memory benefit of conflicting information is absent in MTLE patients and thus seems to critically rely on the integrity of the hippocampus. In healthy participants, the two functions of memory formation and response conflict resolution competed for resources in the hippocampus. In addition, posterior midline areas such as precuneus and PCC supported conflict resolution. In MTLE patients, these posterior midline areas showed reduced conflict-related activation but were recruited for memory formation instead. These results would be in line with a large-scale reorganization of memory networks in epilepsy patients. These alterations may be related to memory impairments and/or deficits in the employment of memories for cognitive control functions. However, further studies in hippocampus-lesioned patients are needed to test the association between episodic memory networks and cognitive control mechanisms. \n\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement \n  \n Markus Ramm:   Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review & editing.

Previous studies suggest that GABA agonists lead to an attenuation of emotion-processing related BOLD signals in the insula. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between GABA concentration and fear-related BOLD responses in this region. In 44 female participants with different levels of fearfulness, GABA concentration in the left insula was measured using a GABA+ MRS acquisition during rest; additionally, BOLD signals were obtained during performance of a fear provocation paradigm. Fearfulness was not associated with GABA+ in the left insula, but could predict fear-related BOLD responses in a cluster in the left anterior insula. The BOLD signal change in this cluster did not correlate with GABA+ concentration. However, we found a significant positive correlation between GABA+ concentration and fear-related BOLD responses in a different cluster that included parts of the left insula, amygdala and putamen. Our findings indicate that low insular GABA concentration is not a predisposition for fearfulness, and that several factors influence whether a correlation between GABA and BOLD can be found. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFear is an acute behavioural and physiological reaction to perceived threat, which has been observed in all mammals and probably evolved because it is useful for survival and avoidance of pain [ ]. Recent research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has identified the amygdala and the anterior insula as key brain structures associated with the experience of fear [ \u2013 ]. While the amygdala is important for the detection of environmental \u2018fear\u2019 cues [ ], the anterior insula seems to play the role of integrating internal bodily perceptions and information from external cues to create the experienced emotional state [ ]. Both these structures have shown increased levels of activity when phobic participants are presented with phobia related material [ \u2013 ], but also when healthy controls are confronted with negative images [ , , ]. \n\nStudies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have also shown that individuals suffering from anxiety disorders have reduced GABA concentration in the occipital cortex [ ], the anterior cingulate and basal ganglia [ ], and the insula [ ]. Also, by enhancing GABA transmission pharmacologically, fear responses [ , ] and emotion related BOLD responses in the insula and the amygdala are attenuated [ \u2013 ]. All these suggest a relationship between GABA neurotransmission and fear-related BOLD responses. However, thus far, this hypothesis has not been directly tested. Previous studies have reported a negative relationship between stimulus-induced BOLD contrast and GABA in the visual cortex [ \u2013 ] and the anterior cingulate [ ]. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between fear induced BOLD responses and GABA concentration in the insula. We recruited participants with either high or low fearfulness and confronted them with a paradigm designed to elicit fear-related BOLD responses. GABA concentration in the insula was assessed in a separate MRS scan at the end of the same scanning session. We expected stronger BOLD responses upon fear inducing stimuli in the insula and amygdala of highly fearful participants, as well as lower GABA concentration in the insula. We also expected a negative correlation between fear-related BOLD changes and GABA concentration in the insula. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nFive-hundred and seventy-four females (Mean[Std] age = 21[ ]) from Cardiff University (students and staff) underwent an online screening, consisting of the Fear-Survey Schedule-II (FSSII, [ ]) and the Fear of Spider Questionnaire (FSQ, [ ]). The FSSII consists of 51 items assessing fear to a wide variety of potential stimuli/situations. The FSQ consists of 18 items assessing fear of spiders; this questionnaire has also shown to discriminate among levels of spider fear within non-phobic population [ ], which was important for our recruitment strategy. Both questionnaires have previously shown adequate psychometric properties [ \u2013 ]. \n\nSince our aim was to recruit a sample of participants with either high or low fearfulness and to induce fear in them via the presentation of still images of specific feared stimuli, we invited candidates with the lowest and highest scores in both questionnaires to participate in the imaging study. Therefore, we aimed for a group of low fearful participants who were also not afraid of spiders, and a group of high fearful participants who all shared their fear of spiders.   illustrates the recruitment criteria on both questionnaires. \n   Recruitment of extreme groups.  \nThe scatter plot for the whole screening sample (N = 574) is shown, with scores in the Fear of Spider questionnaire on the x-axis, and the Fear Survey Schedule II on the y-axis. The purple box illustrates the recruitment thresholds for the high-fear group, the blue box the thresholds for the low-fear group. \n  \nCandidates were screened over the telephone to ascertain their MRI compatibility, right-handedness, and absence of current or personal history of psychosis, mood or anxiety disorders\u2014other than potential specific spider phobia\u2014according to the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, [ ]). On the day of the scan, participants were requested to complete again the FSSII and FSQ, along with the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, [ ]), Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS; [ ]), and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12, [ ]).   shows the mean scores on all the questionnaires. \n   Questionnaires.        \nWe scanned 44 participants, 22 in the high fear group and 22 in the low fear group. Three participants from each group had to be excluded because their scores on the screening questionnaires at the time of scanning did not reflect their original group assignment (their score lay on the other side of the total median). One participant of the low fear group had to be excluded due to problems during the acquisition of the functional imaging data. The final sample consisted of 37 participants, 19 in the high fear group and 18 in the low fear group. \n\nDue to some evidence for an influence of the menstrual cycle on GABA levels [ , ], participants were asked to come for the imaging study during the first 9 days of their cycle; during this period the probability of being in the follicular phase\u2014during which steroid hormone levels are most stable\u2014is 95% [ ]. Three participants did not comply with these instructions: one participant in the low fear group came on day 10, and two participants in the high fear group came on day 12 and day 14, respectively. Participants who were taking hormonal contraception (11 in the high fear and 11 in the low fear group) were asked to come for the scanning session outside their pill-free period, if applicable. The study was approved by the Cardiff University School of Psychology Ethics Committee and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Participants were financially compensated for their time. \n\n\n### 2.2. Fear inducing paradigm \n  \nThe fear inducing paradigm involved presenting still pictures of spiders, of other control animals (birds, caterpillars, snails and lizards), generally negative pictures taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS, [ ]) and neutral pictures also obtained from the IAPS. This allowed us to produce a fear-specific contrast   SPIDERS > ANIMALS   and a fear-unspecific contrast   IAPSnegative > IAPSneutral  . The images were presented in short blocks of 10 seconds, with 4 images (presented for 2.5 sec.) each. After half of the blocks a fixation cross appeared for either 7, 9, 11 or 13 seconds (there were no blocks of the same kind one after the other without a fixation period in between). For each condition, 10 blocks were presented (for more detail see  ). \n\nIn order to guarantee that participants were processing the images presented and not avoiding the more unpleasant pictures, they were instructed to perform a covert task of responding (button press with right index and middle finger) whether they could detect the presence of a human in the picture (50% of the pictures). The tasks were presented in the scanner using Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA) and rear-projected onto a screen behind the participant's head that was visible through a mirror mounted on the RF head coil. After scanning, participants were asked to rate the pictures using a 1 (  very negative  ) to 9 (  very positive  ) scale based on Lang et al\u2019s [ ] pleasure dimension of the Self-Assessment-Manikin scale [ ]. \n\n\n### 2.3. Imaging protocol \n  \nAll data were acquired using a 3T GE HDx MRI System, using a body transmit RF coil and an eight channel receive-only head coil. \n\n#### 2.3.1. Structural scans \n  \nA T1 weighted whole-brain structural scan was acquired for purposes of image and MRS voxel registration (3D fast, spoiled gradient echo, TR/TE = 7.9/3.0 ms, TI = 450 ms, Flip angle = 20 deg, 1 x 1 x 1 mm resolution, 256 x 256 x 176 matrix size). \n\n\n#### 2.3.2. Functional scan: fear inducing paradigm \n  \nDuring task performance, gradient-echo echo-planar T2* images of the entire brain. Forty-six interleaved 2 mm (1 mm gap) AC-PC parallel slices were obtained per volume (204 volumes) with a TR = 3 s, TE = 35 ms, matrix = 64 x 64, FOV = 220 mm, flip angle = 90 . \n\n\n#### 2.3.3. GABA+ magnetic resonance spectroscopy \n  \nGABA+ was quantified from a 25 x 30 x 40 mm voxel located in the left insula and aligned with the insula cortex in an anterior\u2013posterior direction (see  ). Two spectra were acquired for each participant. GABA+ data (GABA plus coedited macromolecules) were acquired using a J difference editing technique (MEGA-PRESS, [ ]). Spectra were acquired with TR = 1800 ms, TE = 68 ms, 300 transients of 4096 data points were acquired in 9 minutes. Gaussian editing pulses (of 16 ms duration) were applied either to the GABA+ spins (1.9 ppm) or symmetrically about the water peak (7.5 ppm) in an interleaved manner. A further eight transients were acquired, without water suppression, in order to obtain water concentration as an internal concentration reference (GABA/water). For a fuller description of this method please refer to Puts & Edden [ ]. \n   Insula voxel position.  \nThis shows the areas that a participant's voxel covered with 85% probability. This map was used for performing the restricted higher-level analysis. \n  \nAll spectra were analysed using Gannet [ ]. GABA+ values were corrected for the tissue composition of the voxel as follows: Tissue segmentation was performed using FAST. The water concentration (used as the reference concentration) was corrected for voxel water content according to Ernst et al. [ ], as implemented in Gannet. The GABA+ signal was divided by the fraction of tissue in the MR voxel to account for the fact that the GABA concentration in the CSF is negligible (for a similar approach see [ ]). Groups did not significantly differ in their voxel gray matter (  t  [ ] = 1.05,   p   = .30) or white matter (  t  [ ] = -0.11,   p   = .91) content. Prior to using GABA+ values for analysis, all spectra were visually inspected independently by two researchers, and rated using a 3-point scale (2 =   very good  , 1 =   satisfactory  , 0 =   reject  ), to ensure the presence of artefacts did not affect the quantification of GABA. Spectra scoring below 1 were rejected, resulting in the exclusion of 26/74 spectra from the dataset. The GABA+ concentration estimations from the two scans per voxel were averaged for each participant if two spectra were available. Altogether, usable GABA+ data was acquired for 29 participants (all included spectra can be seen in  .). \n\n\n\n### 2.4. Physiological parameters \n  \nThe following physiological parameters were recorded during the scanning session: a) the cardiac cycle was recorded using a pulse-oximeter placed on the left index finger, b) a respiration trace was recorded with a pneumatic belt around the chest, c) end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO ) and end-tidal oxygen (PetO ) were recorded using a nasal cannula attached to rapidly responding gas analysers (AEI Technologies, PA) to provide representative measures of arterial partial pressures of both gases. \n\n\n### 2.5. Data preprocessing and analyses \n  \nThe BOLD fMRI time-series data during the emotion paradigm were first corrected for physiological noise. This correction consisted of applying correction of cardiac and respiratory artifacts (RETROICOR, [ ])\u2014using two cardiac, two respiratory and one interaction component and of the variance related to carbon dioxide (PetCO ) level, oxygen (PetO ) level (both HRF convolved), heart rate (HR; CRF convolved; [ ]) and respiratory volume per time (RVT; RRF convolved; [ ]), using a general linear model framework. Both steps were performed using Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., vs. R2011a). Physiological noise correction was performed prior to analysing the data for task responses. For seven participants at least one of the physiological parameters could not be analysed due to technical difficulties during recording. For these participants physiological noise correction was performed with the remaining parameters, for two participants physiological recordings were missing altogether. \n\nThe corrected dataset was subsequently analyzed using FEAT (FMRIB Expert Analysis Tool, v5.98,  , Oxford University, UK). Preprocessing steps before model fitting were applied to each participant\u2019s time-series, and included: highpass filtering of the data (100 s temporal cutoff), non-brain removal using BET [ ],\u201dMCFLIRT\u201d motion correction [ ], spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of full-width-half-maximum 5 mm and fieldmap-based EPI unwarping using PRELUDE + FUGUE [ , ]; for three participants this was not performed due to problems during the acquisition of the fieldmaps. Functional images were registered using FLIRT [ ] in a first step to the structural image with 6 degrees of freedom, and in the second step to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space with 12 degrees of freedom and FNIRT non-linear (10 mm) warp [ , ]. GABA+ measures were not correlated with head motion during the fear provocation task (mean displacement and covariance between task and head motion). \n\nTo model the fear provocation task, four event types were defined, one for each picture condition (i.e.   IAPSnegative  ,   IAPSneutral  ,   SPIDERS  ,   ANIMALS  ). Fixation cross periods were used as the baseline. The model was convolved with the hemodynamic response function (gamma convolution), and the same temporal filtering was applied to the model as to the data. Temporal derivatives were included as regressors of no interest. Two main contrasts of interest were defined: 1)   SPIDERS > ANIMALS  , 2)   IAPSnegative > IAPSneutral  . Group average and group difference (high fear vs. low fear) maps were created with a mixed effects model using FLAME1. For the analysis looking at the influence of GABA+ on the BOLD responses, the demeaned GABA+ measures were entered as a regressor in the group analysis model. For participants with no GABA+ data, the mean value was entered. The Z (Gaussianised T/F) statistic images were thresholded using clusters determined by Z > 2.3 and a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of P <. 05 [ ]. \n\nFor all correlations we defined bivariate outliers based on the overall structure of the data using the Matlab toolbox provided by Pernet et al. [ ], and Pearson correlation coefficients were computed with the remaining data points. Due to outlier removal, sample size changed slightly for each reported correlation. We therefore report correlations with respective degrees of freedom in brackets. \n\nANOVAs were computed using the Matlab functions anova1 and mixed_between_anova ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### 3.1. Behavioural responses \n  \nPerformance on the covert task was very high with a mean accuracy of 93% (  Min  . = 73%,   Std  . = 6%), suggesting that participants did pay attention to the stimuli. We did not find group differences in accuracy or reaction times (  F  [ , ] = 0.23,   p   = .64), and no interaction between group and stimulus category (  F  [3,108] = 0.36,   p   = .78). \n\nWith regard to the picture ratings, we found a significant interaction between group and stimulus category (  F  [3,102] = 6.5,   p   <. 001). This interaction was driven by the group difference in the ratings for spiders (  F  [ , ] = 11.6,   p   <. 01) but not for any of the other categories. Pictures of spiders were rated significantly less pleasant by participants in the high fear group (  Mean   = 2.2,   Std  . = 1.3) as compared to participants in the low fear group (  Mean   = 5.6,   Std  . = 2.9). Spiders were perceived as significantly more negative than the control animals in both of the groups (high fear:   F  [ , ] = 58,   p   <. 01; low fear:   F  [ , ] = 9.08,   p   <. 01), and the negative IAPS pictures as more negative than the neutral pictures (high fear:   F  [ , ] = 67,   p   <. 01; low fear:   F  [ , ] = 40,   p   <. 01). \n\n\n### 3.2. Group activation and group differences in BOLD and GABA+ signal \n  \nThe whole-brain analysis of the fear provocation paradigm showed significant BOLD responses in the orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex, posterior temporal and occipital regions, bilateral anterior insula, medial and lateral prefrontal cortices and cerebellum (see   and  ) for the   SPIDERS > ANIMALS   contrast. The contrast   IAPSnegative > IAPSneutral   resulted in significant BOLD responses in the orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex, left insula, bilateral amygdala, and posterior temporal and occipital regions (see   and  ). Furthermore, the exploratory whole brain analysis revealed stronger BOLD responses for participants in the high fear group in the cerebellum and anterior cingulate for the contrast   SPIDERS > ANIMA  LS, and stronger BOLD responses for participants in the low fear group in the posterior cingulate for the contrast   IAPSnegative > IAPSneutr  al (see  ). Further exploration revealed that the BOLD responses in the posterior cingulate cluster are negative BOLD responses (greater activation during rest than during the task) for both IAPS conditions. \n   Higher level whole-brain analysis for the contrast   SPIDERS > ANIMALS  .

High and low fear groups only differed for the former contrast, with highly fearful participants showing increased BOLD in the insular spectroscopy voxel compared to low fearful participants (see  ). Based on these clusters, functional ROIs within the insula were defined: 1) a fear-specific ROI using the whole-group cluster of the contrast   SPIDERS > ANIMAL  S, 2) a fear-unspecific ROI using the whole-group cluster contrast   IAPSnegative > IAPSneutra  l. \n\nThere was no significant difference between the GABA+ levels of low and high fearful participants (  t  [ ] = -0.29,   p   = .78). \n   Voxel-wise group level analysis, restricted to the regions covered by the spectroscopy voxel.        \n\n### 3.3. The relationship between GABA+ and fear-related BOLD responses \n  \nGABA+ concentration did not correlate with % signal change from either the   SPIDERS > ANIMALS   in the fear-specific ROI (all:   r  [ ] = .26,   ns  ; high fearfulness group:   r  [ ] = .39,   ns  ; low fearfulness group:   r  [ ] = .31,   ns  ), or for the contrast   IAPSnegative > IAPSneutral   in the fear-unspecific ROI (all:   r  [ ] = -.01,   ns  ; high fearfulness group:   r  [ ] = -.31,   ns  ; low fearfulness group:   r  [ ] = .16,   ns  ). \n\nIn order to further investigate the correlation of GABA+ and fear-related BOLD responses, we entered the GABA+ values as a regressor of interest in the whole-brain group level analysis of the fear provocation paradigm. For the contrast   SPIDERS > ANIMALS  , GABA+ predicted BOLD responses in a cluster covering parts of the left amygdala, insula, and ventral striatum (coordinates [x,y,z] = -28,-4,-12, cluster size = 420; see  ) ), and in the frontal cortex (coordinates [x,y,z] = -46, -26, 58, cluster size = 649). No correlations between GABA+ and BOLD were found for the contrast   IAPSnegative > IAPSneutral  . \n   Two clusters within the spectroscopy voxel, both from contrast   SPIDERS > ANIMALS  , red: cluster in the left anterior insula obtained from group level analysis of the contrast   SPIDERS > ANIMALS  , yellow: cluster in the left anterior insula obtained from entering GABA+ as a regressor in the group level analysis.  \nMedian %SC from clusters were extracted. ANOVAs were calculated for both ROIs, with a significant interaction for the group-sensitive ROI, and no significant results for the GABA+-sensitive ROI. Purple dots represent participants from the high fear group, blue dots participants from the low fear group, and dots with a strike through participants that were identified as outliers and excluded for correlation. Correlations without outlier exclusion are   r  [ ] = .22 (  p   = .24) for the cluster obtained from group level analysis, and   r  [ ] = .71 (  p   <. 0001) for the cluster obtained from entering GABA+ as a regressor in the group level analysis. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe goals of the present study were to investigate BOLD reactivity in the anterior insula during fear provocation, and the role of insular GABA+ concentration and fearfulness in this reactivity. We found increased BOLD responses during fear provocation, this being greater in individuals with high, relative to low, fearfulness. GABA+ concentration in the insular cortex did not differ between the fearfulness groups, and was not associated with BOLD responses in the insula cluster detected during the task. Finally, GABA+ concentration predicted BOLD responses during the task in a different cluster that included brain areas typically associated with the experience of fear, among them part of the insula. \n\n### 4.1. The relationship between fearfulness and neuroimaging measures (BOLD and GABA+) in the insular cortex \n  \nOur fear provocation paradigm was designed to elicit fear-specific (pictures of spiders vs. control animals) and fear-unspecific (negative vs. neutral IAPS pictures) BOLD responses. In line with previous results [ , , ], our paradigm succeeded in eliciting BOLD responses in the anterior insula during both fear-specific and fear-unspecific conditions, along with responses in cingulate cortex, cerebellum and regions within the frontal, temporal and occipital cortices; only the fear-unspecific images brought significant responses in the amygdala, though. Group differences were only observed for the fear-specific BOLD responses, with high fearful participants showing greater responses in cerebellum, anterior cingulate and left anterior insula. These results suggest that fearfulness only influences fear-specific, but not fear-unspecific, BOLD responses. This effect is also reflected at a behavioural level, since we only found group differences in the rating of spider pictures but not negative IAPS pictures. This finding somehow opposes previous results suggesting general increased responses in amygdala and insula to negative stimulation in anxiety prone participants [ ] or in phobic participants to general negative\u2014opposite to phobia related\u2014stimulation [ ]. However, the two groups in our sample differed more markedly in their scores to the SPQ than to the FSS-II, which could explain why group differences were also more substantial regarding the fear-specific than fear-unspecific stimulation. In any case, whether brain responses to fear related stimuli are qualitatively similar to responses to generally negative stimulation remains unresolved and would require further investigation. \n\nWe did, however, find stronger BOLD signals for the low fear group than for the high fear group in the posterior cingulate. The posterior cingulate is often investigated in the context of the default-mode and task-negative network [ , ]. Task-related deactivation of this area was also the case in this study. The group difference we found was caused by less deactivation during presentation of negative vs. neutral IAPS pictures, in participants with low fearfulness only. We speculate that this might indicate that low fearful participants are using an emotion regulation strategy that involves upregulating their default mode network\u2014Goldin et al. [ ] found the BOLD in the posterior cingulate associated with reappraisal\u2014however, this needs further investigation. \n\nPrevious studies using clinical samples, such as patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, have shown a GABA+ deficit in highly fearful participants over a number of brain regions [ \u2013 ]; however, we did not find this to be the case in our non-clinical sample when looking at GABA+ in the insular cortex. It is possible that reduced GABA+ levels are only a marker in clinical populations; although it could also be possible that lower GABA+ concentration is a clinical consequence of the disorder rather than a premorbid factor. Additionally, in some of the previous studies investigated patients were medicated, which could contribute to the measured GABA+ concentration. It also has to be mentioned that not all previous studies report a decrease in GABA+ in highly anxious individuals [ ], and whether a decrease can be found might depend on the investigated brain area. In any case, our results suggest no association between GABA+ concentration in the insula and individual differences in fearfulness. \n\n\n### 4.2. The relationship between GABA+ and fear-related BOLD signals \n  \nEven though the %BOLD signal change obtained in the anterior insula in response to fear-specific stimuli did not correlate with GABA+ concentration in the same area of the brain, entering GABA+ as a regressor of interest in the analysis of the fear provocation paradigm revealed a second cluster covering parts of the insula, amygdala and striatum. Unlike most previous studies, though, we found a positive rather than a negative correlation between BOLD and GABA+ [ \u2013 ]. This difference in the direction of the relationship could be explained by several factors: A) the voxel from which GABA+ concentration was extracted. Even though interneurons and inhibition are present throughout the cortex, their importance and role might differ from region to region. To our knowledge, there is only one previous study investigating BOLD-GABA+ correlation in the insula [ ]. Like the present results, this study reported a positive correlation between both measures, which could indicate that GABA-BOLD relationship depends on the brain area investigated. B) our BOLD measure results from the contrast between two active conditions rather than the comparison to baseline. We did match the stimuli in our conditions with regard to a number of features that could influence the BOLD response, in order to be left with the emotional aspect when contrasting the conditions. Even though there are non-negligible problems with setting up contrasts [ ], BOLD responses compared to baseline could be contaminated by factors such as level of visual processing (e.g. how much attention to detail do participants pay), strategies to solve the simple task, and also more physiological factors such as vascular reactivity\u2014factors that should play a reduced role for a contrast. This in mind, previous studies did show a negative correlation between GABA+ and BOLD, but the factors driving that correlation are not yet resolved. \n\nTo test whether looking at the contrast vs. main effect makes a difference with regard to the effect of GABA, we calculated the correlation between GABA+ and BOLD for all four main effects (contrast to fixation cross baseline). It turned out that there are no correlations in any but the   ANIMAL   condition, and the correlation is negative (see  ). This suggests that the correlation between BOLD and GABA+ depends on the nature of the BOLD signal investigated. The BOLD signal in the anterior insula, which was found to be influenced by levels of fearfulness, was not influenced by GABA+ levels. The BOLD signal in the cluster sensitive to GABA+ was not influenced by fearfulness, and GABA+ was only associated with BOLD signal during the presentation of animal pictures but not fear-inducing spider pictures or IAPS images. It is possible that GABA related processing plays different roles dependent on stimuli, and that the BOLD signal during the presentation of negatively valenced (spiders and negative IAPS) or complex (IAPS pictures as compared to the pictures of animals) is more strongly influenced by other factors than GABA, which could explain why we only found the GABA-BOLD relationship for the control animal condition. The previous studies that demonstrated the negative correlation between GABA and BOLD used simple visual stimulus material without complex or emotional content to be processed [ \u2013 ], except for Northoff et al. [ ] using emotional faces, but looking at negative BOLD. The pictures of our control animals are also rather simple stimuli. These results suggest that the GABA concentration in a region might have a specific role in fear-processing in that region. However, in contrast to studies which reported a decrease in fear-specific BOLD responses upon manipulation of GABA transmission [ , ], our study looked at between-subject correlations rather than at within-subject effects. This means, that even though we could not demonstrate a fear-specific relationship between GABA and BOLD, manipulating GABA transmission might still affect the fear-related BOLD responses in the insula we detected. Importantly, the correlation we found between GABA+ and BOLD responses in the control condition of our task indicates that future studies adopting pharmacological manipulation should also investigate the effect of GABAergic drugs on BOLD responses in the control condition of their task. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nDesigning our paradigm, we aimed for two contrasts comparing the BOLD signal during the processing of negatively valenced images to the BOLD signal upon neutral stimuli. Participants were asked to rate the images after the scanning session, and as expected negative IAPS pictures were rated as significantly more negative than neutral IAPS pictures, while spider pictures were rated as significantly more negative than pictures of other animals. However, both neutral conditions (neutral IAPS pictures and control animal pictures) were rated as slightly positive with a median of around 7 on a scale from 1\u20139. Even though this indicates that our neutral conditions were in fact slightly positive conditions, we argue that the positive ratings are result of a contrast effect. In other words, because we did not include positive stimuli in the paradigm, participants might have tried to make use of the whole rating scale which resulted in positive ratings for the neutral stimuli. We did select the control stimuli based on ratings in a previous study [ ] and on a pilot we conducted, suggesting that the pictures were in fact neutral. To make sure neutral pictures are actually perceived as neutral, for future studies, it might therefore be an advantage to include positive stimuli, irrespective of the research question. \n\nOur results suggest that a low GABA concentration in the insula is not\u2014as hypothesized\u2014a predisposition for fearfulness and fear-related BOLD responses. This does not necessarily challenge the importance of GABA neurotransmission in fear learning and expression, as frequently demonstrated in animal studies [ ]. Even though a negative correlation between GABA concentration in a region and BOLD responses in the same region seems intuitive, the idea of \u201cmore GABA, more inhibition, less BOLD\u201d is probably oversimplified. It is in fact not well understood what role GABA and GABAergic interneurons play in the generation of the BOLD signal [ \u2013 ], the current understanding being that even though postsynaptic activity in excitatory synapses but not in inhibitory synapses directly influence BOLD, it is the balanced proportional changes in excitation-inhibition activity that lead to the generation of the BOLD response [ ]. So even though the negative correlation between GABA+ and BOLD responses in the   ANIMAL   control condition suggests that higher GABA+ levels are associated with higher levels of inhibition and lower BOLD responses, in the future, analysis of GABA as well as excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, might provide a more complete picture of the relationship between neurochemistry and BOLD responses. \n\nOne limitation of this study, common to all research using MRS, is the unspecificity of the MRS signal with regard to the region of interest, but also to the origin of the signal. Due to low signal-to-noise ratio, MRS has very low spatial resolution as compared to the fMRI sequence. The insula voxel was 25 x 30 x 40 mm, and covered areas surrounding the insula, such as frontal areas and the putamen. Furthermore, spatial overlap of the spectroscopy voxel between participants is not exact. This means, we acquired GABA+ concentration from slightly different regions in each participant. Due to increased noise in the insula spectroscopy voxel as compared to other voxel locations, we acquired two spectra from each participant, and excluded bad quality spectra based on expert ratings. The amount of spectra that were excluded reflects the challenge related to obtaining GABA+ data from more noisy regions, and the data loss is a limitation of this study. Given the restricted data quality, further studies are needed to support our results since it is possible that the positive correlation we found is a false positive result. \n\nFurthermore, within the measured regions, the origins of the GABA+ signal are not clear. The concentration measure is unspecific to whether GABA is intra- or extracellular, so it does not necessarily give an indication of GABA transmission. Low GABA concentration could either indicate a less established interneuron network, with less interneurons, or less connected interneurons. On the other hand, GABA concentration could be a state marker of interneuronal activity or current GABA availability. Last but not least, the GABA+ peak in the spectrum is influenced by macromolecules [ ] however, studies such as this investigating links between behaviour and GABA have been proposed to be less influenced by the macromolecule signal than those comparing GABA+ levels patients and control groups [ ]. \n\nWe cannot rule out that the fear-inducing paradigm had an effect on the GABA+ concentration, potentially influencing the correlation between BOLD responses and GABA+ concentration. Recently, a few studies have suggested that GABA+ may be subject to changes induced by experimental manipulation, such as stress induction [ ]. Also the activation of a brain region can have an influence on later measured GABA+ levels, as shown by Michels et al. [ ]. These findings indicate that GABA+ levels are not completely stable. In our scanning protocol, we performed the GABA+ spectroscopy at the end of the session. We cannot rule out that the functional paradigm or potentially even the scanning situation itself altered the GABA+ levels in our participants. \n\nThe sample used in this study exclusively consisted of female participants. This somewhat limits the generalizability of the findings. However, investigating female populations is particularly important in the face of higher prevalence of anxiety disorders in females as well as stronger BOLD responses to negatively valenced stimuli [ ]. Since gender differences in the GABA-BOLD correlation cannot be excluded, replication of our findings in a male sample would be required. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nWe found fear-related BOLD responses brain regions that have been previously associated with emotion processing. BOLD responses in the insula were stronger for participants with high fear than for participants with low fear, but we did not find any group differences in GABA+ concentration. We found a positive correlation between fear-related BOLD and GABA+ concentration in a cluster including insula, putamen and amygdala. This was in contrast to our expectations, and suggests that whether a positive vs. negative relationship between GABA+ and BOLD is found depends on the investigated region and the nature of the contrast. \n\n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4374765, "text_md5": "739a8566f1d7599a4ee54f7df7c304e4", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 109], "journal": [110, 118], "publication_year": [120, 124], "title": [135, 225], "keywords": [239, 239], "abstract": [252, 1543], "body": [1552, 37671]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 25811453, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0120101", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4374765", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4374765"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4374765\">4374765</a>", "list_title": "PMC4374765  The Relationship between Fearfulness, GABA+, and Fear-Related BOLD Responses in the Insula"}

Here, we used experimental sleep disruption to examine the relationship between sleep disruption\u2010induced pain sensitivity and functional connectivity (FC) of cognitive networks contributing to pain modulation. Nineteen healthy individuals underwent two counterbalanced experimental sleep conditions for one night each: uninterrupted sleep versus sleep disruption. Following each condition, participants completed functional MRI including a simple motor task and a noxious thermal stimulation task. Pain ratings and stimulus temperatures from the latter task were combined to calculate a pain sensitivity change score following sleep disruption. This change score was used as a predictor of simple motor task FC changes using bilateral executive control networks (RECN, LECN) and the default mode network (DMN) masks as seed regions of interest (ROIs). Increased pain sensitivity after sleep disruption was positively associated with increased RECN FC to ROIs within the DMN and LECN (  F   = 25.28,   pFDR   = 0.05). However, this pain sensitivity change score did not predict FC changes using LECN and DMN masks as seeds (  pFDR  \u2009>\u20090.05). Given that only RECN FC was associated with sleep loss\u2010induced hyperalgesia, findings suggest that cognitive networks only partially contribute to the sleep\u2010pain dyad. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nEvidence consistently shows that sleep disturbance leads to a variety of neurobiological and behavioral adaptations (Bosch et al.,  ; Short & Banks,  ; Verweij et al.,  ). Even one night of total sleep deprivation is associated with brain changes, especially in neural networks underlying cognitive control, affect, and memory (Krause et al.,  ). However, these neurobiological differences are not always linked with detrimental behavioral responses. Some individuals actually benefit from acute sleep disturbance (Chuah, Venkatraman, Dinges, & Chee,  ; Sletten, Segal, Flynn\u2010Evans, Lockley, & Rajaratnam,  ), begging the question: what mechanisms drive diverging responses to various types of sleep loss? \n\nAmong aberrant sequelae associated with sleep loss, maladaptive changes in pain perception represent one of the largest public health concerns. First, emerging evidence suggests that chronic sleep loss predicts new cases of chronic pain and exacerbations of existing pain symptoms (see Finan, Goodin, & Smith,   for a review). Second, there is a high prevalence and rate of comorbidity between chronic pain and chronic sleep disturbance (Alsaadi et al.,  ; Karaman et al.,  ; Koffel et al.,  ; Tang, Wright, & Salkovskis,  ). There are many protocols to experimentally alter sleep in order to explore mechanisms of the sleep\u2010pain dyad, such as total sleep deprivation (i.e., preventing individuals from sleeping at all through >24\u2010hr period), sleep restriction (i.e., limiting sleep under 8 hr), and forced awakenings (i.e., interrupting sleep at various intervals throughout the night). Because chronic pain patients tend to experience difficulty staying asleep\u2014characterized by multiple night time awakenings (i.e., sleep maintenance insomnia)\u2014the forced awakenings paradigm is a particularly relevant tool for understanding the relationship between sleep disruption and pain sensitivity (Rosseland, Pallesen, Nordhus, Matre, & Bl\u00e5gestad,  ). \n\nPain itself is a complex experience that is influenced by sensory, affective, and cognitive processes (Apkarian, Bushnell, Treede, & Zubieta,  ; Bushnell, \u010ceko, & Low,  ; Price,  ). While various networks contribute to this perception, brain regions associated with cognitive control are critical for our ability to modulate pain. Notably, cognitive control exerts top\u2010down influence over sensory and affective pain components (Seminowicz & Ceko,  ). For this reason, the present study focused on the relationship between sleep disruption\u2010induced hyperalgesia and function across networks associated with cognitive control. \n\nTwo key networks involved in cognitive pain control are the executive control network (ECN) and default mode network (DMN). The ECN predominately includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and posterior parietal areas, and the DMN is composed of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, and inferior parietal lobules. Functionally, the ECN is linked with attention to relevant information and suppression of irrelevant information (Awh, Vogel, & Oh,  ; Gazzaley & Nobre,  ; Smith et al.,  ), and the DMN is associated with self\u2010referential thought and focus on internal milieu (Andrews\u2010Hanna, Reidler, Sepulcre, Poulin, & Buckner,  ; Lorenzi et al.,  ; Raichle,  ). \n\nPrevious work suggests that the functional dynamics of these networks can contribute to the detection and inhibition of nociceptive inputs. For example, greater ECN\u2010mPFC functional connectivity (FC) was associated with better cognitive modulation of pain among healthy individuals (Kong et al.,  ). Commensurate with this finding, another study demonstrated greater ECN\u2010DMN FC in individuals who learned and practiced cognitive modulation strategies over 21\u2009days compared to participants who completed a treatment control (Kucyi, Salomons, & Davis,  ). These results suggest that ECN\u2010DMN FC is positively associated with pain modulation and is responsive to intervention. \n\nInteractions between these networks are susceptible to experimental sleep manipulation. In this regard, greater ECN\u2010DMN FC has been documented in healthy individuals after one night of experimental sleep deprivation (Bosch et al.,  ). Additional measures reflecting increased functional coupling among DMN and ECN nodes, such as a reduction in anticorrelation and loss of functional segregation, following sleep deprivation have also been reported (De Havas, Parimal, Soon, & Chee,  ; Ben Simon, Lahav, Shamir, Hendler, & Maron\u2010Katz,  ). Per se, sleep deprivation is associated with the separate phenomena of hyperalgesia and greater ECN\u2010DMN coupling; however, it is unclear how sleep disruption via forced awakenings might influence the relationship between ECN and DMN. \n\nThe present study used one night of forced awakenings to determine the effects on pain sensitivity and cognitive networks associated with pain modulation. The limited timeframe of the sleep manipulation used in this study may help to identify early brain responses to sleep disruption that contribute to sleep loss\u2010related hyperalgesia. Based on the complex literature described above, we hypothesize that changes in ECN\u2010DMN FC following sleep disruption will be associated with changes in pain sensitivity. However, given that previous studies suggest that the association between changes in ECN\u2010DMN FC and pain sensitivity could be either positive or negative, the potential direction of this association remains unclear. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \nThe present analyses were completed on data from an fMRI task that was part of a larger neuroimaging protocol used to examine the effects of one night of experimental sleep disruption via forced awakenings on the neural correlates of pain sensitivity and affective pain modulation in healthy individuals (Seminowicz et al.,  ). The primary data examined in the present study include (a) pain ratings and stimuli temperatures from a noxious thermal stimulation task (i.e., we did not use fMRI data from this task) and (b) a simple motor task (SMT) designed to elicit intrinsic network connectivity without the risk of participants falling asleep. Pain ratings and stimuli temperatures were computed in a change score (described below) and used as a predictor of individual differences in pain sensitivity following sleep loss. More information about the task used to derive the pain ratings and stimuli temperatures is provided in  . \n\nThe neuroimaging protocol was further nested within a larger study (R01DA032922) that included additional nights for each sleep conditions and separate daytime procedures conducted on the day following the MRI scan; these data are not examined for the present study. All procedures were approved by Institutional Review Boards (IRB) at Johns Hopkins University and University of Maryland, Baltimore in conformation to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent to complete study procedures and were notified of their right to withdraw from study procedures at any time without penalty. Figure   demonstrates the methods used in the present study. \n  \nThis study is an analysis of a simple motor task collected during fMRI scanning as part of a larger protocol. Procedures used in the present study are outlined above. Participants underwent two nights of monitored sleep. One night included an 8\u2010hr opportunity for uninterrupted sleep. The other night included a sleep disruption protocol, wherein participants were awakened during one randomly chosen 1\u2010hr interval and seven 20\u2010min tertiles for the remaining hours. Structural and functional MRI scanning was completed following each night. Structural MRI and simple motor task fMRI data were used to address the study's aims \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSMT fMRI data were collected from 22 healthy individuals after uninterrupted and experimentally disrupted sleep. Participants were eligible if they met the following criteria: (a) met Research Diagnostic Criteria for Normal Sleepers, (b) scored <5 on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and <10 on the Epworth Sleepiness scale, (c) had average total sleep time between 6.5 and 8.5 hr/night and sleep efficiency >85% as reported on 2\u2009weeks of sleep diaries and captured via actigraphy monitoring, (d) showed a stable sleep phase within 21:00 and 10:00, (e) polysomnography\u2010confirmed apnea\u2010hypopnea index <10, (f) denied a lifetime history of pain persisting >6\u2009months or acute pain as measured on the McGill Pain Questionnaire and baseline sleep diaries, (g) reported no significant medical or psychiatric morbidity within 6\u2009months of study participation and obtained   T  \u2010scores <64 on the Brief Symptom Inventory global scales, (h) no lifetime history of bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, recurrent major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, reported history of traumatic brain injury, or seizures, (i) reported no tobacco/nicotine use and low caffeine use (<2 cups per day), (j) had a BMI <35, and (k) no MRI contraindications. \n\nThe present analyses were completed on data from 19 individuals (14 women; mean age = 23.95\u2009years (  SD   = 4.17)) after two participants were excluded for incomplete fMRI data, and one individual was found to be an outlier with influential, extreme values for pain ratings. Seven participants identified as White Non\u2010Hispanic, two individuals identified as White Hispanic, five participants identified as Black Non\u2010Hispanic, one individual identified as Black Hispanic, two participants identified as mixed race, and one individual identified as Other Hispanic. Participant demographics and psychosocial function are listed in Table  . \n  \nParticipant demographic characteristics (  n   = 19) \n    \n\n### Experimental design and statistical analyses \n  \n#### Sleep monitoring and manipulation \n  \nParticipants completed two nights of sleep monitoring at the Johns Hopkins Clinical Research Unit (CRU). Neuroimaging data analyzed for this study were collected following a night of 8\u2010hr sleep opportunity (uninterrupted sleep, US) and following a night of sleep fragmentation via forced awakenings (FA). The order of these study visits was counterbalanced among participants to control for temporal confounds. \n\n##### Uninterrupted sleep \n  \nFor the US condition, participants were given the opportunity for 8 hours of sleep at the CRU without experimental disruption. \n\n\n##### Sleep disruption procedure \n  \nThe present study used a previously described sleep disruption protocol (see Finan et al.,  , for a complete description). We chose sleep disruption (i.e., FA) based on previous work suggesting that this type of paradigm results in greater impairment of endogenous pain modulation compared to sleep restriction (Smith, Edwards, Mccann, & Haythornthwaite,  ). \n\nBriefly, the night was divided into eight 1\u2010hr intervals, with one randomly chosen interval in which no sleep was allowed. The remaining seven 1\u2010hr intervals were further divided into 20\u2010min tertiles, so that one tertile per hour interval was randomly selected for a forced awakening. CRU staffs were responsible for waking up participants at these randomly chosen times and ensuring that participants remained awake throughout the interval. The maximum sleep allowed for the FA night was 280\u2009min. \n\n\n\n#### MRI session \n  \nAll structural and functional MRI scanning was completed at the University of Maryland, Baltimore Magnetic Resonance Research Center between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. Data were acquired using a Siemens 3T Tim Trio scanner with a 32\u2010channel head coil. Structural images were collected using a high\u2010resolution T1\u2010weighted MPRAGE anatomical scan with the following parameters: 240 slices, TR 2,300\u2009ms, TE 2.98\u2009ms, flip angle 9\u00b0, FOV 256\u2009mm, matrix 256 \u00d7\u2009256\u2009mm, resolution 1.0 \u00d7\u20091.0\u2009mm, slice thickness 1\u2009mm, no gap. Participants also completed 3 fMRI runs of an experimental pain task, during which a noxious thermal stimulus was applied to the left medial forearm (fully described in Seminowicz et al. ( ) and  ). Neuroimaging data from this task were not used in the present study, but pain ratings aggregated over 15 stimulation periods were used to derive the predictor variable for FC analyses. Please see   for complete methods related to the noxious thermal stimulation task. \n\nThe present study aimed to examine changes in FC as they related to individual differences in pain sensitivity before and after sleep disruption. Due to concerns that participants might fall asleep in the scanner using a traditional resting\u2010state task, we instead collected data using a 10\u2010min SMT, which required participants to respond to the direction of a projected arrow (left or right). Arrows were sequentially displayed for 500\u2009ms seconds at a time, with a total of 150 trials. Left and right arrows were shown in equal proportion. Interstimulus intervals were jittered and ranged from 1s to 4\u2009s each. Task stimuli were programmed and run using Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, Berkeley, CA) on a desktop computer in the scanner suite. Participants used an angled mirror mounted on the MRI head coil to view task images via a translucent screen with back\u2010project images. The following instructions were provided:   During this time  ,   we will help you stay awake by having you engage in a simple task that involves using your response box. You will look up and see a screen  ,   and on the screen an arrow pointing either left or right will flash periodically. When the right facing arrow flashes  ,   you should press 3 (the button farthest to the right). When the left facing arrow flashes you should press 1 (the button farthest to the left)  . \n\nPrevious work has shown minimal FC differences between traditional resting\u2010state tasks (i.e., acquired during a steady\u2010state period of non\u2010goal\u2010directed activity) and simple motor tasks, such as the one we employed (Baliki, Geha, Apkarian, & Chialvo,  ; Jurkiewicz, Crawley, & Mikulis,  ). At each visit, the SMT scanning sequence included an interleaved T2*\u2010weighted, echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: spin\u2010echo, 658 volumes/run, 66 slices, TR: 907\u2009ms, TE: 30\u2009ms, flip angle 52\u00b0, FOV 224\u2009mm, matrix size 110 \u00d7\u2009102\u2009mm, resolution 2.0 \u00d7\u20092.0\u2009mm, slice thickness 2.0\u2009mm, multiband factor 6. \n\n\n#### Pain sensitivity change score \n  \nThe present study aimed to examine changes in FC among cognitive networks as it related to sleep loss\u2010induced hyperalgesia. In order to examine this aim, we computed a pain sensitivity change score as a predictor variable. For the parent study, participants underwent a quantitative sensory testing session before scanning at both study visits to derive participant\u2010tailored temperatures for the fMRI noxious stimulation task. Temperatures rated between 5 and 8 out of 10 were selected. During fMRI scanning, these tailored temperatures were presented concomitant with music of neutral valence. Pain ratings were made following the delivery of each noxious thermal stimulus, which ended at the same time the music clip ended. The same procedure was employed at each study visit (see   for additional details). Due to the aims of the parent study, music stimuli were paired with each noxious thermal stimulus. The parent study also overlaid positive\u2010valence song clips on noxious thermal stimuli in separate blocks, but pain ratings associated with those blocks were not used in the present study because they were associated with pain inhibition (Seminowicz et al.,  ). \n\nA pain sensitivity change score was calculated using pain ratings and tailored temperatures. Temperatures ranged from 40\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C, so we subtracted 40 from each temperature denominator to make the scales of pain ratings and temperatures equal (0\u201310). Our approach of subtracting 40 from temperature values was intended for scaling purposes only and does not assume an association between the temperature value and pain rating value. \n\nSome individuals experienced changes in both temperature and pain ratings (e.g., lowered temperatures with higher pain ratings after FA sleep would indicate increased pain sensitivity). As such, we calculated a pain sensitivity change score using the following equation, with higher values indicating greater pain sensitivity following FA: \n\n\n#### Behavioral data analyses \n  \nUsing SPSS 25 (IBM), we ran paired\u2010samples   t   tests to examine condition\u2010based differences in the following variables: total sleep time (TST), stage N1, stage N2, slow wave sleep (SWS), rapid eye movement sleep (REM), Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), SMT percent accuracy, pain ratings collected during the noxious thermal stimulation task, and thermal stimuli temperatures used during the noxious thermal stimulation task. No transformations were applied to these data. \n\n\n#### Neuroimaging data processing \n  \n##### Functional MRI data preprocessing \n  \nSMT data were preprocessed in SPM12 v6906. The preprocessing pipeline included realignment (motion correction), coregistration of the T1 anatomical to the mean functional image, segmentation of the anatomical to six standard tissue probability maps in SPM12, normalization of functional images using forward deformation fields from anatomical segmentation, and spatial smoothing using a 6\u2009mm full\u2010width at half maximum (FWHM) kernel. Data were visually inspected for quality control to determine motion artifact. Further, the Artifact Detection Tool (ART;  ) was also used to mark potentially confounding outliers in the SMT time series for exclusion (i.e., rotation >.02\u2009rad from prior volume, or translation >.4\u2009mm from the prior volume (Chai, Ofen, Gabrieli, & Whitfield\u2010Gabrieli,  ). No condition\u2010based differences in outlier detection (  p   = .4) or motion correction (  p   = .38) were identified. \n\nWe used the CONN toolbox (Whitfield\u2010Gabrieli & Nieto\u2010Castanon,  ) to complete denoising procedures and FC analyses. Gray matter, white matter, and CSF masks were created via anatomical segmentation and were eroded by one voxel to minimize partial volume effects (Whitfield\u2010Gabrieli & Nieto\u2010Castanon,  ). Physiological confounds, including respiratory and cardiac activity, were accounted for by using the white matter and CSF masks as nuisance regressors during denoising (Behzadi, Restom, Liau, & Liu,  ). Denoising including scrubbing of excessive motion and outliers detected via ART and regression of white matter and CSF masks (% volumes removed: mean = 1.9%, range = 0.53\u20135.34%). A stepwise, rather than simultaneous, regression approach was applied to maintain adequate degrees of freedom of the resting\u2010state data (Patel & Bullmore,  ). Data were bandpass filtered between .008 and .09 (Aurich, Alves Filho, Marques da Silva, & Franco,  ). \n\n\n##### Hybrid independent component analysis\u2010seed\u2010based functional connectivity \n  \nWe conducted hybrid independent component analysis (ICA)\u2010seed\u2010based FC analyses on denoised fMRI data in the CONN toolbox. Previous work suggests that hybrid ICA\u2010seed\u2010based FC analyses result in better reproducibility of fMRI results than either ICA or seed\u2010based analyses alone (Kelly et al.,  ). First, group ICA is a data\u2010driven technique that identifies orthogonal sources of variance within the data (Calhoun, Adali, Pearlson, & Pekar,  ), yielding independent components (ICs). Each IC contains brain regions with activity co\u2010occurring across a unique time course, thought to represent a neural network (Calhoun, Adal\u0131, & Pekar,  ). \n\nConsistent with steps described by Calhoun et al. (Calhoun et al.,  ), denoised data first underwent participant\u2010 and condition\u2010level BOLD signal concatenation. We estimated the optimum number of ICs within the GIFT toolbox using minimum description length criterion (Li, Adali, & Calhoun,  ), yielding 20 potential ICs. Dimensionality reduction was then conducted at the group\u2010level to identify these 20 dimensions/ICs. To estimate IC maps at the group\u2010level, the fastICA algorithm was used. Group\u2010level IC maps are then back reconstructed on individual\u2010level data via GICA1 backprojection to create individual\u2010level IC spatial maps that can be pooled for second\u2010level GLM statistics; however, only the group\u2010level ICs were used to create seeds for subsequent analyses. Resultant group\u2010level ICs were sorted to freely available spatial templates of RECN, LECN, and the DMN (Shirer, Ryali, Rykhlevskaia, Menon, & Greicius,  ). The IC with the strongest match to each template (based on the Dice coefficient) was converted into a binarized map used in subsequent seed\u2010based analyses (Table  ; Figure  ). \n  \nClusters identified within each independent component that was used as a seed for seed\u2010to\u2010ROI functional connectivity analyses. Independent components represented the right executive control network (RECN), left executive control network (LECN), and default mode network (DMN) \n      \nIndependent component analysis (ICA) was conducted on simple motor task fMRI data. Resultant independent components (ICs) were spatially sorted to standardized templates to identify bilateral executive control networks (blue and green) and the default mode network (red). Dice coefficients ranged from 0.26 to 0.39 for goodness of fit. These top fitting ICs were masked for use as a region of interest (ROI) in subsequent seed\u2010to\u2010ROI functional connectivity analyses \n    \nMean pain ratings and temperatures are shown in white (uninterrupted sleep, US) and gray (forced awakenings, FA) bars, whereas individual differences in these measures are shown in uniquely colored lines. The present study aimed to examine cognitive network FC changes as a function of sleep induced\u2010hyperalgesia. To derive a measure of change in pain sensitivity following FA during the sleep fragmentation condition compared to US, we calculated a pain sensitivity change score accounting for changes in individually tailored stimulus temperatures used for a noxious thermal stimulation task and concomitant pain ratings. In the \u201cThermal Stimuli Temperature\u201d panel, some lines overlap and are eclipsed for individuals who had identical changes in temperature \n  \nBinarized IC masks were added to the CONN toolbox as a priori regions of interest (ROIs). Further, the Power 264\u2010region atlas was used to define 10\u2009mm ROI spheres across the whole brain (Power et al.,  ). This whole\u2010brain atlas describes subgraphs of functionally integrated nodes as defined by graph theory analyses on resting\u2010state fMRI data, rather than structurally defined. First\u2010level analyses were completed in CONN to extract time series data within each ROI and compute Fisher's r\u2010to\u2010Z transformed bivariate correlations among these ROIs. \n\n\n##### GLM analyses \n  \nContrast images were entered into a second\u2010level seed\u2010to\u2010ROI analysis to determine FC differences between US and FA across the sample. The pain sensitivity change score described above was inserted as a regressor of interest, and RECN, LECN, and DMN masks were defined as seeds. In total, there were six primary sets of GLM tests, including three seed\u2010to\u2010ROI tests (i.e., RECN, LECN, and DMN as seeds) and three tests examining associations among RECN, LECN, and DMN masks (i.e., RECN\u2010LECN, LECN\u2010DMN, RECN\u2010DMN). ROIs in the seed\u2010to\u2010ROI analyses included 264 spheres from the Power 264 atlas. A conservative analysis\u2010level threshold across seeds was applied as a correction for multiple comparisons (  pFDR  \u2009<\u2009.05). We used a two\u2010tailed test given the nature of our competing directional hypotheses. \n\n\n\n#### Data availability statement \n  \nWe have shared the resultant ROI maps from the present study in   (Gorgolewski et al.,  ), which is a public repository for neuroimaging statistical maps. Data are located at the following link:  \n\n\n#### Validation analyses \n  \nGiven the small sample size, we attempted to replicate findings using a distinct dataset. These analyses were exploratory in nature and not part of the primary aim. However, the complex and unique experimental approach used in our study limited our ability to test replication in an experimentally matched dataset. Instead, we examined whether clinical pain ratings moderated the relationship between sleep quality (i.e., Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory scores) and FC values that resulted from our primary analyses. This validation sample included 30 individuals with migraine who reported poor sleep quality (i.e., PSQI >5). Methods from the study associated with our validation sample are reported at the following link:  . \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Sleep manipulation check \n  \nTo examine the efficacy of our sleep disruption manipulation we examined condition\u2010based differences in several sleep parameters. As expected, there was a significant decrease in minutes of TST, stage N2, SWS, and REM sleep phases, and a significant increase in stage N1 sleep. Participants reported significantly greater sleepiness during the FA compared to US condition. Table   provides means,   SD   values, and paired\u2010samples   t   test results for these variables. Combined, these results indicate the efficacy of the experimental manipulation. \n  \nComparison of polysomnography findings detailing participants\u2019 total sleep time (TST) and times in stages N1, N2, slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep at the uninterrupted sleep (US) and forced awakenings (FA) conditions. Additional data reflect condition\u2010based differences in self\u2010reported sleepiness (Stanford Sleepiness Scale; SSS), performance on the fMRI simple motor task (SMT), and pain ratings/stimulus temperatures from the noxious thermal stimulation task \n    \n\n### Pain ratings, thermal stimuli temperatures, and SMT performance \n  \nTable   lists statistical information about condition\u2010based differences in pain ratings, thermal stimuli temperatures, and SMT performance. Neither pain ratings nor thermal stimuli temperatures significantly differed between the US and FA conditions. On the SMT, participants\u2019 accuracy in identifying arrow directions was better during US compared to FA (74.8% and 63.3% accuracy, respectively). The low accuracy scores were due to missed trials or incorrect responses. \n\n\n### Left and right ECN and DMN functional connectivity \n  \n#### RECN as a seed \n  \nSeveral ROIs from the Power atlas demonstrated significant FC changes with the RECN seed associated with pain sensitivity change scores (omnibus model:   F   = 25.28,   pFDR   = .05; individual ROI statistics reported in Table  ; Figure  ). Specifically, there was a positive association between increased pain sensitivity and increased RECN FC to left dlPFC (part of the LECN), left medial and inferior frontal gyri (MFG, IFG, respectively; part of the DMN), and the right paracingulate gyrus (part of the DMN). There was also a positive association between increased pain sensitivity and decreased RECN FC to the right lateral occipital cortex (LOC; part of the DMN). Table   provides additional information about these ROIs, and Table   provides descriptive statistics for FC values based on condition. \n  \nSignificant power atlas ROIs yielded from seed\u2010to\u2010ROI analyses examining differences in cognitive network FC between the uninterrupted sleep and forced awakenings sleep conditions associated with pain sensitivity change scores \n      \nTo examine the relationship between change in pain sensitivity and change in cognitive network functional connectivity (FC) following forced awakenings, we conducted seed\u2010to\u2010region of interest (ROI) FC analyses using the right executive control network (RECN, red), left executive control network (LECN), and default mode network (DMN) as a priori seeds and a pain sensitivity change score as a predictor of interest. We did not identify significant associations between the LECN and DMN as seeds for seed\u2010to\u2010ROI FC analyses. However, there was a positive association between pain sensitivity change scores and change in FC between the RECN seed and several ROIs located within the LECN, dDMN, and the primary visual network (shown as colored spheres; as defined by the Power 264 atlas). Numbers represent the associated ROI within the Power 264 atlas (see Table   for corresponding region names). Scatterplots demonstrate the relationship between FC values and pain sensitivity change scores \n    \nDescriptive information for functional connectivity values based on sleep condition \n    \n\n#### Null results \n  \nAlthough the RECN seed demonstrated significant associations between six RECN\u2010ROI pairs and pain sensitivity change scores, the additional five primary analyses did not pass our significance threshold corrected for multiple comparisons. Specifically, neither the LECN nor DMN seed demonstrated significant seed\u2010to\u2010ROI FC associations with pain sensitivity changes (  p  FDR\u2009>\u2009.05). Further, FC between ECN and DMN seeds did not show significant pairwise associations between FC and pain sensitivity change scores (  p  FDR: RECN\u2010LECN = .06, RECN\u2010DMN = .16, LECN\u2010DMN = .63). \n\n\n\n### Validation analyses \n  \nWe tested whether clinical pain ratings moderated the relationship between PSQI scores and FC values from the six significant RECN\u2010ROI pairs on a separate sample of migraine patients who reported poor sleep quality. Among these six ROIs, there was only one significant moderation effect of pain on the relationship between RECN\u2010right paracingulate gyrus (  F   = 6.4,   p\u2009=   .02). The other RECN\u2010ROI moderation analyses were not significant (  p  s range = .37\u2013.91). Because this was not an ideal validation sample, however, we do not further interpret results. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThe present study examined the association between cognitive network FC and individual differences in sleep loss\u2010induced hyperalgesia following one night of sleep disruption. In a healthy sample of normal sleepers, we used an experimental manipulation to produce multiple, prolonged FA during one night of sleep. We broadly hypothesized that neural systems associated with cognitive pain control would be affected by sleep loss and that these changes would be related to changes in pain sensitivity. Overall, we saw variability in the magnitude and direction of changes in participants\u2019 pain sensitivity following one night of acute sleep loss, with an overall positive association between pain sensitivity changes and changes in RECN FC to several brain regions (i.e., dlPFC, MFG, IFG, paracingulate gyrus, and LOC). These results, however, are qualified by null findings across five additional a priori tests. Taken together, results only partially support our hypothesis of greater ECN\u2010DMN FC in individuals with higher pain sensitivity following sleep disruption, suggesting that cognitive network alterations only partially contribute to sleep loss\u2010induced hyperalgesia. \n\n### Pain sensitivity following forced awakenings \n  \nWhen combining pain ratings and thermal stimuli temperatures, some individuals displayed hyperalgesia while others showed decreased pain sensitivity. Even across pain ratings, which were obtained following tonic noxious thermal stimuli that were paired with neutral\u2010valenced music, there were no overall mean changes in pain sensitivity across the sample after a single night of FA sleep. Although these findings are somewhat inconsistent with previous research demonstrating hyperalgesia following sleep loss, it should be noted that most of those studies were conducted over multiple nights of accumulated sleep loss. In fact, this study's parent project recently found that two nights of sleep disruption via FA\u2010induced hyperalgesia in a larger sample (  n   = 79), reducing both heat pain threshold and cold pain tolerance. The present study's design using one night of FA did not induce a ubiquitous hyperalgesic response; however, results cautiously show the early changes in RECN FC contributes to sleep disruption\u2010induced hyperalgesia. \n\nFurther, differences in quantitative sensory testing across studies make comparisons across studies challenging. In the present study, we analyzed pain ratings obtained following the application of tonic noxious thermal stimuli that were paired with neutral\u2010valenced music, as the parent study design did not include noxious thermal stimuli presented alone (see Seminowicz et al.,  ). As with many quantitative sensory testing studies, the uniqueness of our study design may limit the generalizability of the present results. We encourage future replication attempts. Cautiously, these results suggest varied responses to acute sleep loss in healthy adults, with some individuals evidencing greater pain vulnerability to sleep loss, which may have more significant clinical implications (Lautenbacher, Kundermann, & Krieg,  ). \n\n\n### RECN functional connectivity changes following forced awakenings \n  \nOur study specifically examined FC of bilateral ECNs and DMN to functionally defined ROIs throughout the brain (Power et al.,  ), and FC among bilateral ECN and DMN masks. The ECN is a group of brain regions associated with top\u2010down modulation of sensory stimuli via goal\u2010directed attentional amplification of relevant information, as well as goal\u2010directed suppression of irrelevant information (Awh et al.,  ; Gazzaley & Nobre,  ; Smith et al.,  ). Importantly, the ECN is engaged during cognitive pain control in individuals with and without chronic pain (Ceko et al.,  ; Ceko et al.,  ; Kong et al.,  ; Rainville,  ; Sevel, Letzen, Staud, & Robinson,  ; Villemure & Bushnell,  ). The DMN, on the other hand, is a group of brain regions associated with self\u2010referential thought and focus on internal milieu (Andrews\u2010Hanna et al.,  ; Lorenzi et al.,  ; Raichle,  ). Its activity is typically anticorrelated with ECN activity during cognitive tasks so that better suppression of the DMN is associated with better cognitive performance (Fox et al.,  ; Seminowicz & Davis,  ; Smith, Sip, & Delgado,  ). Because evidence links ECN and DMN interactions with cognitive control of sensory inputs that are susceptible to perturbations from sleep disruption, the combined previous findings were suggestive of ECN\u2010DMN FC as a putative mechanism for sleep loss\u2010induced hyperalgesia. \n\nAmong tested networks in the present study, however, changes in pain sensitivity were only associated with changes in RECN FC, and we did not observe significant changes in the association between pain sensitivity and ECN\u2010DMN FC. Instead, there was a positive association between increased pain sensitivity following sleep deprivation and increased RECN FC to specific regions within the DMN and LECN as well as decreased RECN FC to a primary visual network region as a function of changes in pain sensitivity. These regions included the left dlPFC (LECN), left MFG/IFG and right paracingulate gyrus (DMN), and right LOC (primary visual network). \n\nThe dlPFC is among the brain regions commonly associated with pain vigilance, awareness, and attention (Lorenz, Minoshima, & Casey,  ; Seminowicz et al.,  ; Seminowicz & Davis,  ; Seminowicz & Moayedi,  ; Valet et al.,  ). Findings from experimental sleep research suggest that individual differences in emotional responses following sleep loss are associated with changes in attention (Alfarra, Fins, Chayo, & Tartar,  ). Attentional processes are well documented in the context of experimental pain so that pain vigilance contributes to exacerbated pain intensity and distraction is associated with lower pain report (for a review, see Wiech, Ploner, & Tracey,  ). Individuals sleeping less than 6.5 hr per night have also been found to have impaired ability to derive analgesic benefits from distraction techniques (playing video games) during an experimental pain task. Further, because stronger anticorrelation between DMN\u2010ECN activity is associated with better segregation of internally and externally directed awareness (Buckner,  ; Horovitz et al.,  ; Larson\u2010Prior et al.,  ), increased RECN\u2010DMN FC\u2014as identified in this study\u2014potentially suggests poorer ability to modulate attention. The combined findings of increased intrinsic, interhemispheric dlPFC FC and RECN FC to regions within the DMN might represent heightened attention to sensory stimuli, contributing to greater pain sensitivity. \n\nIt is not fully clear why we observed lateralization effects of significantly altered RECN, but not LECN, FC. Although debated, there is some evidence suggesting a greater propensity of right hemisphere activity in relation to pain processing (Coghill, Gilron, & Iadarola,  ; Ji & Neugebauer,  ; Symonds, Gordon, Bixby, & Mande,  ). Additionally, a previous study examining resting\u2010state attentional networks in individuals with insomnia found altered right, but not left, hemisphere FC (Li et al.,  ). Although it is possible that RECN FC is one mechanism contributing to sleep loss\u2010induced hyperalgesia, the fact that this was the only seed to demonstrate significant findings across all six a priori tests tempers the strength of inference. Future research is encouraged to measure whether other neural networks contribute to sleep loss\u2010induced hyperalgesia. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe present results should be interpreted in the context of several important limitations. First, the small sample size used in the present study, coupled with the high number of a priori tests, weakens the strength of inference. Second, previous studies using the FA protocol over two nights showed it maximally induced hyperalgesia (Iacovides, George, Kamerman, & Baker,  ) and diminished pain inhibition (Finan et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ). In the present study, we used a smaller time window (one night) than previously reported, which might account for our lack of robust hyperalgesia findings. Our previous data suggest that more than one night of FA sleep is beneficial for examining sleep\u2010pain responses. Third, although the FA paradigm is thought to have face validity for the type of sleep disturbance profile commonly observed in patients with chronic pain (i.e., multiple prolonged awakenings with significant concomitant reduction in total sleep time) (Rosseland et al.,  ), it may not generalize fully to sleep disruption linked with chronic insomnia, which may be due to a variety of clinical factors that influence pain in addition to the multiple awakenings themselves. Our results should be extended to include patient populations that suffer from sleep loss. Fourth, as mentioned earlier, pain ratings were collected from a paradigm using neutral music overlay, so we could not rule out the possible influence of distraction on imaging findings. The primary findings should be replicated in a design that includes thermal stimuli presented alone. Fifth, we did not assess individuals\u2019 cognitive strategies used to control pain. Given that there are individual differences in cognitive pain control strategies (Seminowicz, Mikulis, & Davis,  ), future studies should measure how ECN\u2010DMN FC patterns relate to strategy use following sleep disturbance. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nThe present findings suggest that healthy individuals have idiographic pain responses to one night of sleep disruption and that these responses are partially associated with changes in RECN FC to regions within the LECN and DMN. Future prospective studies are needed to examine whether additional neural networks further contribute to the sleep\u2010pain dyad and whether RECN FC changes might act as one mechanism potentially involved in the chronification of pain via sustained sleep disruption. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors declare no competing financial interests. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6981017, "text_md5": "60b977a919a9e885635e3230433050f3", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 131], "journal": [132, 146], "publication_year": [148, 152], "title": [163, 320], "keywords": [334, 428], "abstract": [441, 1839], "body": [1848, 41412]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 31617662, "doi": "10.1002/hbm.24824", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6981017", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6981017"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6981017\">6981017</a>", "list_title": "PMC6981017  Individual differences in pain sensitivity are associated with cognitive network functional connectivity following one night of experimental sleep disruption"}

Social stress buffering, the phenomenon of a social partner attenuating acute stress responses, is a potential yet unexplored mechanism that may underlie this relationship. \n\n Objective:   This study examined whether perceived friendship quality was related to better mental health and lower neural stress response in young people with CA. \n\n Method:   A total of   N  \u2009=\u2009102 young people (aged 16\u201326) with low to moderate CA were included in the study. We first investigated associations between friendship quality, mental health, and CA. In a representative subset (  n  \u2009=\u200962), we assessed neural stress responses using the Montreal Imaging Stress Task. In our sample, CA was best described along two dimensions resembling threat or deprivation like experiences. Hence, we investigated both cumulative and dimensional effects of CA. \n\n Results:   We found no support for social thinning after CA, meaning that the severity of CA (cumulative or dimensional) did not differentially impact friendship quality. High-quality friendships, on the other hand, were strongly associated with better mental health. Furthermore, acute stress increased state anxiety and enhanced neural activity in five frontolimbic brain regions, including the left hippocampus. We found weak support that threat experiences interacted with friendship quality to predict left hippocampal reactivity to stress. However, this effect did not survive multiple comparison correction. \n\n Conclusion:   The absence of social thinning in our sample may suggest that the risk of developing impoverished social networks is low for rather well-functioning young people with low to moderate CA. Regardless, our findings align with prior research, consistently showing a strong association between high-quality friendships and better mental health in young people with CA. Future research is needed to examine whether friendships aid neural stress responses in young people with childhood threat experiences. \n   HIGHLIGHTS  \n  \nYoung people with childhood adversity underwent acute stress induction, eliciting frontolimbic reactivity. \n  \nHigh-quality friendships were strongly associated with better mental health. \n  \nWeak support for friendship stress buffering did not survive multiple comparison correction. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nUp to half of children and adolescents worldwide experience at least one form of childhood adversity (CA), such as abuse, neglect, bullying, or poverty (Bellis et al.,  ). Exposure to CA represents a deviation from the \u2018expectable\u2019 environment, which requires young people to adapt their psychological, social, and neurobiological functioning, ultimately putting them at greater risk for prolonged mental health problems (Cicchetti & Valentino,  ; Clark et al.,  ; Kessler et al.,  ; McLaughlin,  ). In fact, around a third of lifetime mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders can be attributed to CA (Green et al.,  ). Hence, investigating neurodevelopmental mechanisms that underlie mental health vulnerability and identifying protective factors that buffer these risk pathways is crucial for informing the development of effective psychosocial interventions. \n\nChronic or repeated exposure to CA has programming effects on key stress response systems, which can increase later-life mental health vulnerability (Lupien et al.,  ). For example, repeated activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis leads to elevated levels of stress hormones (glucocorticoids) in the body (McEwen,  ). This neuroendocrine response to prolonged psychosocial stress may promote adaptive functioning (e.g. increased alertness) in the short-term to support survival in stressful environments. However, over time, sustained activation of this stress response system may be detrimental to the structure and function of stress-sensitive brain regions (Arnsten,  ; Chen & Baram,  ; Danese & McEwen,  ). Frontolimbic brain regions, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex (PFC), may be particularly sensitive to stress in the context of chronic CA exposure due to their dense innervation with glucocorticoid receptors (Cohodes et al.,  ; Ioannidis et al.,  ; Tottenham & Sheridan,  ). \n\nGiven the importance of the frontolimbic system for social information and emotional processing (Humphreys et al.,  ; McLaughlin et al.,  ), alterations to that system following CA may increase mental health vulnerability, as suggested by (McCrory et al.,  ). Their social transactional model of mental health vulnerability posits that through neurocognitive adaptations to high stress environments, young people with CA might become more likely to subsequently experience (interpersonal) stress (i.e. \u2018stress generation\u2019; [McCrory et al.,  ]) and attenuation in their support networks (i.e. \u2018social thinning\u2019; [Nevard et al.,  ; Sheikh et al.,  ]), contributing to greater mental health vulnerability. \n\nCritically, social support is a key protective factor against the emergence of mental health problems in young people with CA (Li et al.,  ; Trickey et al.,  ). However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of this relationship. Social stress buffering models suggest that the presence of a social partner can reduce physiological responses to acute psychosocial stress, measured by glucocorticoid blood levels (Gunnar,  ; Sullivan & Perry,  ). During childhood, caregiver support suppresses cortisol secretion to acute psychosocial stress (Hostinar et al.,  ), dampens amygdala reactivity, and promotes emotion regulation (Gee et al.,  ) in children without CA. In addition, previously institutionalised children with greater self-reported feelings of caregiver security exhibited reduced amygdala reactivity to caregiver cues, which was also predictive of a greater decrease in future anxiety symptoms (Callaghan et al.,  ). During adolescence, a unique time of social reorientation and increased sensitivity to peers (Cosme et al.,  ), friendship support takes on a more potent stress buffering role, capable of protecting against the emergence and progression of mental health problems following CA (van Harmelen et al.,  ,  ). Preliminary evidence for friendship stress buffering has shown that the more time spent interacting with supportive friends was associated with diminished neurobiological stress responses (i.e. reduced cortisol, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and anterior insula reactivity) in young people without CA (Eisenberger et al.,  ; Masten et al.,  ). To date, only two studies have examined friendship stress buffering in young people with CA and reporting mixed results, for a systematic review see (Scheuplein & van Harmelen,  ). Tang et al. ( ) showed that high-quality friendships were associated with improved sympathetic nervous system reactivity to social rejection feedback at age 12 and reduced peer problems at age 16 in early institutionalised young people. In contrast, no support for friendship stress buffering was found in a small community sample of well-functioning adolescents with low to moderate CA (Fritz et al.,  ). Therefore, it remains unclear whether high-quality friendships aid mental health and well-being in young people with CA through dampening neurobiological stress responses. \n\nTo investigate friendship stress buffering in young people with CA, it is crucial to clearly quantify CA experiences, whilst accounting for the fact that different types of CA often co-occur (Brown et al.,  ; Dong et al.,  ). On the one hand, the cumulative-risk approach assumes that discrete forms of CA have additive, but not distinct, effects on neurocognitive functioning, with more CA being associated with stronger effects. Hence, this prevailing approach combines the number of distinct types of adverse experiences into a cumulative risk score (Evans et al.,  ). This approach has been highly influential in public policy and clinical practice (Lacey & Minnis,  ). On the other hand, dimensional models of adversity differentiate between experiences of   threat/harshness   (involving harm or threat of harm to oneself and others),   deprivation   (involving absence of expected cognitive and social stimulation), and   unpredictability   (involving spatial-temporal variation in threat) to identify mechanisms linking these partially distinct experiences of CA with unique neurodevelopmental and psychopathological consequences (Ellis et al.,  ; Humphreys & Zeanah,  ; McLaughlin et al.,  ; Sheridan & McLaughlin,  ). In line with this framework, Puetz et al. ( ) showed that different forms of childhood maltreatment (abuse, neglect, and their combination) were associated with differential neural processing of threat-related cues. Specifically, childhood abuse was associated with increased localised ventral amygdala reactivity to threat, whereas childhood neglect was associated with heightened reactivity in the dorsal amygdala and across spatially distributed frontoparietal brain networks. Notably, cumulative experiences of abuse and neglect were associated with hypoactivation in various higher- order cortical regions, in addition to the amygdala. Furthermore, a systematic review by (McLaughlin et al.,  ) investigated differential associations between threat and deprivation experiences and neural development. To summarise their key findings, threat experiences were found to influence frontolimbic neural networks involved in threat detection and emotion regulation (amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)), salience processing (insula, ACC), and various forms of learning and memory (hippocampus). Deprivation experiences, on the other hand, were found to influence frontoparietal circuits (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and superior parietal cortex) contributing to working memory and cognitive control. However, these neural patterns were not consistently observed across studies, highlighting the need for more neuroimaging research to establish consistent and replicable associations between brain alterations and different dimensions of CA. \n\nThe main goal of this study was to investigate whether perceived friendship quality was related to reduced neural stress responses in a sample of adolescents and young adults (aged 16\u201326) with low to moderate CA. In addition, we examined relations between CA, friendship quality, and mental health and well-being. To challenge neural stress responses affected by CA, we utilised the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST) (Dedovic et al.,  ). The MIST is a well-validate acute psychosocial stress paradigm combining the stress-eliciting effects of high cognitive demands (solving math problems under time pressure) with negative social feedback (on screen and verbally via the experimenter), see review by (Noack et al.,  ). Previous studies that utilised the MIST reported stress-related activation in frontolimbic regions, including the hippocampus, amygdala, insula, mPFC, ACC, nucleus accumbens (NAc), and thalamus (Chung et al.,  ; Noack et al.,  ; Voges et al.,  ; Wheelock et al.,  ). Hence, we examined the neural correlates of friendship stress buffering in these regions of interest (ROIs). \n\nSpecifically, we examined three hypotheses. First, we hypothesised that more severe CA experiences would be associated with lower levels of perceived friendship quality (McCrory et al.,  ; Nevard et al.,  ; Sheikh et al.,  ) and that reduced friendship quality would be associated with worse mental health functioning (Fritz et al.,  ; van Harmelen et al.,  ,  ) (hypothesis 1). Second, we expected that acute psychosocial stress would increase state anxiety (Chung et al.,  ; Zschucke et al.,  ) and increase neural activity in our ROIs (Noack et al.,  ) (hypothesis 2). Third, we expected that friendship quality would moderate the relationship between CA and neural stress responses. Specifically, we investigated whether higher friendship quality would be associated with reduced frontolimbic ROI reactivity to stress (Scheuplein & van Harmelen,  ; Tang et al.,  ) (hypothesis 3). Finally, we examined these hypotheses with both a cumulative-risk approach and a dimensional approach. We expected that more CA experiences, or more severe threat experiences, would be associated with greater frontolimbic ROI reactivity to stress (McLaughlin et al.,  ). \n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Resilience after individual stress exposure (RAISE) study \n  \nData were drawn from the Resilience after Individual Stress Exposure (RAISE) study, a multilevel study of   N  \u2009=\u2009102 young people aged 16\u201326 (Moreno-L\u00f3pez et al.,  ). All RAISE participants retrospectively self-reported a history of CA, which was defined as exposure to any adverse life event experienced within the family environment before the age of 16. This included childhood maltreatment (e.g. emotional, sexual, or physical abuse, emotional or physical neglect) or intrafamily adversity (e.g. marital distress or conflict, parental mental health problems or parental alcohol dependence, violence, or aggressive behaviour) ( ). Participants were recruited across Cambridgeshire, UK from the general population through flyers and via social media as well as from previous studies conducted at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge (NSPN 2400 Cohort; [Kiddle et al.,  ]). The RAISE study has received funding from the Royal Society in January 2018, ethical approval from the National Research Ethics Service and the NRES Committee East of England-Cambridge Central (REC reference: 18/EE/0388, IRAS project ID: 241765) in February 2019, and commenced in August 2019.\n   \nSeverity of childhood adversities in the baseline sample. \n\nNote. Severity (in percent; x-axis) of individual childhood adversities (y-axis) retrospectively self-reported by all   N  \u2009=\u2009102 young people, who participated during the first assessment timepoint (T1) of the RAISE study. Each boxplot displays the median severity (solid vertical line) and interquartile range. Based on established cut-off scores for the CTQ (Bernstein et al.  ), this baseline sample can be characterised reporting low to moderate levels of CA. Summary statistics are provided in the supplementary Table A.1.1. \n    \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nThis study utilised data from the first two RAISE assessment timepoints. At timepoint 1, participants completed online questionnaires (  N  \u2009=\u2009102; \u2018Baseline sample\u2019). Timepoint 2 was completed on average 1 month later and consisted of an in-unit visit at Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital in Cambridge, UK during which, among other measures, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data was acquired (  n  \u2009=\u200962; \u2018Neuroimaging sample\u2019). At each timepoint, informed consent was obtained from the participant. A comprehensive description of the full study procedure as well as the inclusion and exclusion criteria has been previously published by (Moreno-L\u00f3pez et al.,  ). To summarise, individuals were eligible to participate if they were aged between 16 and 26 years, able to speak, write, and understand English, had a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 29.9\u2005kg/m , did not currently take medication (e.g. corticosteroids) likely to compromise the interpretation of our data, had no MRI contraindications, and self-reported CA experienced before the age of 16. All inclusion and exclusion criteria were assessed via telephone by a trained member of the study team to ensure that interested participants were eligible. Medication use and BMI were re-assessed by a trained research nurse at the day of scanning. Participants received a total of \u00a3150 upon completing all three study phases (please note that data from the third study phase was not included in the analysis for this study). If participants chose not to proceed after the first or second phase, they were partially reimbursed. The payment was distributed as follows: \u00a310 for the initial completion of online questionnaires and three cognitive tasks, \u00a3100 for their attendance at Addenbrooke's Hospital, and \u00a340 for completing the second set of online questionnaires. This study commenced in August 2019 and was terminated prematurely in March 2020, prompted by a University-wide closure of laboratory research activities and the redirection of clinical research facilities toward COVID-19 related studies. Hence,   n  \u2009=\u200942 participants who completed the baseline assessment could not be assessed at timepoint 2. However, key characteristics (e.g. age, gender, CA experiences, or friendship quality) are comparable between the neuroimaging sample and baseline and the participants who could not complete the study as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic (Table A.1.1). \n\n\n### Baseline assessments (T1) \n  \nAt baseline, participants received an email containing an online link to remotely complete self-report questionnaires assessing past CA experiences as well as current (past two to four weeks) mental health, well-being, and friendship quality. Specifically,   CA   was assessed with the Short-Form of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-SF; [Bernstein et al.,  ]), the Measure of Parental Style Questionnaire (MOPS; [Parker et al.,  ]), and the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ; [Frick,  ]).   Mental health and well-being   (in the following referred to as psychosocial functioning) was assessed with the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ; [Angold & Costello,  ]), Revised Children\u2019s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS; [Reynolds & Richmond,  ]), the Leyton Obsessional Inventory-Child Version (LOI-CV; [Bamber et al.,  ]), the Behavioral Checklist (BCL; [van Harmelen et al.,  ]), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES; [Rosenberg,  ]), the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10; [Kessler et al.,  ]), the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS; [Tennant et al.,  ]), and the Drugs and Self Injury Questionnaire (DASI; [Wilkinson et al.,  ]).   Friendship quality   was assessed with the Cambridge Friendship Questionnaire (CFQ; [van Harmelen et al.,  ]). Across all questionnaires, higher scores reflect more severe CA experiences, better psychosocial functioning, and greater perceived friendship quality. A detailed description of all questionnaires is provided in the supplementary information (section B). Given that we recruited adolescents and young adults aged 16\u201326 (  M  \u2009=\u200922.24 at baseline), we chose these measures to ensure that all questionnaires (incl. instructions and items) were accessible and age-appropriate for the entire sample (Demkowicz et al.,  ), which is also in line with similar approaches utilised in previous large-scale longitudinal cohort studies assessing young people aged 14\u201324 (Goodyer et al.,  ; Kiddle et al.,  ). \n\n\n### In-unit assessments (T2) \n  \nDuring the in-unit visit, participants completed the vocabulary and matrix reasoning subtests of the   Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence   (WASI-II; [Wechsler,  ]) from which age-normed IQ scores were derived. IQ scores ranged from 78 to 138 (  M  \u2009=\u2009116.09,   SD  \u2009=\u200910.18). Furthermore, the   Edinburgh Handedness Inventory   (EHI; [Oldfield,  ]) indicated that 91% of participants preferred using the right hand for more complex manual tasks. Furthermore, state anxiety was assessed with the   State-Trait Anxiety Inventory   (STAI; [Spielberger & Vagg,  ]) before and after participants completed the MIST in the MRI scanner. \n\n#### fMRI stress paradigm \n  \nThe   Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST)   is a well-validated and widely used acute psychosocial stress paradigm for fMRI (Berretz et al.,  ; Chung et al.,  ; Corr et al.,  ; Dedovic et al.,  ,  ; Noack et al.,  ; Pruessner et al.,  ). This computerised mental arithmetic task with an artificially induced failure component was presented as a block design across two imaging runs. Each run lasted 11\u2005min and consisted of a stress, control, and rest condition ( ). The order of these conditions was counterbalanced across participants to avoid order effects.\n   \nGraphical user interfaces of the Montreal Imaging Stress Task. \n\nNote. (A) Stress condition: from top to bottom, the figure shows the performance bar displaying the average performance of previous participants (artificially set to 80%) as well as the participant\u2019s current performance. Below, participants were presented with math problems of varying difficulty whilst being shown the titrated time limit, they had to provide a response. A response was submitted via the rotary-dial (answer choices between 0 and 9). Finally, participants received trial-by-trial on screen performance feedback (\u2018correct\u2019 in green, \u2018error\u2019 in red, or \u2018timeout\u2019 in yellow). (B) Control condition: participants answered math problems of the same difficulty level and received trial-by-trial performance feedback (\u2018correct\u2019, \u2018error\u2019). However, no time constraints were enforced, the performance bar was not displayed, and participants were instructed that their performance would not be recorded. (C) Rest condition: participants were presented with the empty task interface and asked to keep their eyes open and not press buttons until the next math problem would appear. \n    \n\nDuring the 5\u2005min   stress condition   ( A), participants were asked to answer math problems of varying difficulty under time constraints whilst receiving trial-by-trial on screen performance feedback (\u2018correct\u2019 in green, \u2018error\u2019 in red, or \u2018timeout\u2019 in yellow). To answer, participants were provided a button box and instructed to navigate left or right on a rotary-dial to the correct digit (between 0 and 9). In addition, a performance bar at the top of the screen continuously displayed the \u2018average\u2019 performance of previous participants (artificially set to 80%) as well as the participant\u2019s current performance. Participants were instructed to attain or surpass the average performance of their peers. To induce a high failure rate, the participant\u2019s response time limit got adjusted throughout the task to enforce a range of approximately 20% to 45% correct responses (Dedovic et al.,  ). Specifically, participants were given 10% less time after three consecutive correct responses and 10% more time after three consecutive incorrect or timeout responses. To further induce psychosocial stress, participants were presented with a 5 sec on screen summary of their current performance and were reminded that their \u2018performance should be close to or better than the average performance\u2019. This summary was presented at five timepoints during the stress condition. In addition, participants received scripted negative verbal feedback in between runs from a member of the study team saying: \u2018Your performance is below average. In order for your data to be used, your performance should be close to or better than the average performance. Please try as hard as you can next round\u2019. \n\nDuring the 5\u2005min   control condition   ( B), participants answered math problems of the same difficulty level and received trial-by-trial performance feedback (\u2018correct\u2019 in green, \u2018error\u2019 in red). However, no time constraints were enforced, the performance bar (including the \u2018average\u2019 peer performance) was not displayed, and participants were instructed that their performance would not be recorded. \n\nDuring the 1\u2005min   rest condition   ( C), participants were presented with the empty task interface and asked to keep their eyes open and not press buttons until the next math problem would appear. \n\nThe MIST took approximately 35\u2005min to complete including approximately 5\u2005min of practice outside the MRI scanner to familiarise participants with each condition. For this study, we used an adapted version of the MIST originally programmed by (Borchert,  ) for Millisecond Software, LLC (openly available at:  ). \n\n\n\n### Imaging procedures \n  \n#### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nfMRI was conducted on a Siemens 3T Magnetom Prisma Fit whole body MRI scanner (Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head coil. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) data were collected using a T2*-weighted transversal echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with interleaved slice acquisition, covering the entire brain (repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20092000\u2005ms, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u200930\u2005ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200978\u00b0, number of slices\u2009=\u200934, slice thickness\u2009=\u20093\u2005mm, slice gap\u2009=\u20090.3\u2005mm, voxel size\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2005mm , field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192\u2005mm , in-plane resolution\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964). To obtain a 3D structural scan, high-resolution sagittal T1-weighted images were acquired using a magnetisation prepared-rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (TR\u2009=\u20092000\u2005ms, TE\u2009=\u20092.98\u2005ms, flip angle\u2009=\u20099\u00b0, number of slices\u2009=\u2009176, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2005mm, slice gap\u2009=\u20090.5\u2005mm, voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2005mm , FOV\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2005mm , in-plane resolution\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256). \n\n\n#### fMRI preprocessing and data analysis \n  \nPreprocessing of the imaging data was performed using SPM12 ( ) implemented in MATLAB (version R2020a; MathWorks) following standard procedures. To summarise, images were realigned to the mean image of the scan run using a 6-parameter rigid body spatial transformation, spatially normalised to the standard stereotactic space of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template, resampled to 3\u2005mm isotropic voxels, and smoothed with an 8\u2005mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. In addition, framewise displacement (FD) was computed based on the head motion parameter and used as quality checks (Power et al.,  ). As recommended by (Schwarz et al.,  ), participants with a   M  \u2009>\u20090.5\u2005mm or more than 20% volumes with FD\u2009>\u20090.5\u2005mm in any of the two runs were excluded from subsequent analyses. Based on this rule and through visual inspection,   n\u2009  =\u20092 participants were excluded, leaving a total neuroimaging sample of   n  \u2009=\u200960 (Table A.1.1). \n\nFor the first-level analysis, we defined a general linear model (GLM) for each subject and each condition of the MIST (convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) of SPM12). Six head motion parameters from the realignment step were included as covariates. A high-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 1/262\u2005Hz and an autoregressive model of the first order were applied. To identify regions showing greater activation (i.e. greater mean BOLD signal) during the stress condition compared to the control condition, we computed stress\u2009>\u2009control first-level contrasts for each participant. This contrast allowed for investigating the effect of acute psychosocial stress on brain activation whilst controlling for activation changes induced by mental arithmetic. \n\nFor the second-level analysis, single-subject contrast maps were entered into random effects analyses (one-sample   t  -test). Based on our a-priori hypotheses, ROI analyses were performed using bilateral masks for the hippocampus, amygdala, insula, mPFC, ACC, NAc, and thalamus. ROI analyses were conducted using the pipeline implemented in the Wake Forest University (WFU) PickAtlas SPM12 toolbox (version 3.0.5; (Maldjian et al.,  ,  );  ). Specifically, these ROIs were defined using the PickAtlas GUI and resliced to match smoothing. Given that the anatomical region of the mPFC is less well defined, this ROI mask was based on the anatomical location of both dorsal and ventral mPFC (including the ACC; Brodmann areas (BA): 9, 10, 11, 24, 25, 32) (Moreno-L\u00f3pez et al.,  ; Passingham & Wise,  ; van Harmelen et al.,  ). All other ROIs were based on the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al.,  ). ROI results were familywise error (FWE) corrected (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05) using voxel-level statistics. For all ROIs that showed a significant main effect of task, we extracted individual beta weights by averaging across all activated voxels in the cluster containing the ROI peak (Tong et al.,  ). We applied no restriction for the minimum cluster size. To comprehensively examine neural activation outside our ROIs, we additionally conducted follow-up exploratory whole-brain analyses (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05) using the same stress\u2009>\u2009control contrast, k\u2009>\u200925 voxels. \n\n\n\n### Principal component analysis \n  \nPrincipal component analyses (PCAs) with oblique rotation were used to explore differential dimensions of CA experiences and to capture the range of psychosocial outcomes in our sample. Specifically, we computed principal component (PC) scores, weighted by their explained variance for CA and psychosocial functioning, respectively. The PCA for CA revealed a two-component solution so that CA could be delineated along two dimensions resembling   threat   and   deprivation   experiences. Those dimensional scores were subsequently combined into a   cumulative CA index  , with a higher index indicating more severe CA ( A). Specifically, this PCA was conducted on standardised individual total scores of the Measure of Parental Style Questionnaire (MOPS; measure of maternal and paternal abuse, indifference, and overcontrol), the Short-Form of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-SF; measure of physical abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect), and the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ; measure of corporal punishment, poor parental involvement, and negative parenting). The PCA for psychosocial functioning revealed a three-component solution, and we summed the weighted PC1, PC2, and PC3 scores to compute a   cumulative psychosocial functioning index  , with a higher index indicating better mental health and well-being ( B). This PCA was conducted on standardised individual total scores of the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS; measure of mental well-being), the Revised Children\u2019s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS; measure of physiological anxiety, worry/oversensitivity, and social concerns/concentration), the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ; measure of depressive symptoms); the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES; measure of self-esteem); the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10; measure of psychological distress); the Leyton Obsessional Inventory-Child Version (LOI-CV; measure of compulsions, obsessions, and cleanliness), and the Behavioral Checklist (BCL; measure of behavioural problems). Please note that all results hold when only using the weighted PC1 score for psychosocial functioning. A similar method has been employed by (Anand et al.,  ) and a detailed description of our analyses as well as a summary of the PC scores and their associations can be found in our supplementary information (section E).\n   \nPrincipal component analysis loading matrices for childhood adversity and psychosocial functioning. \n\nNote. Two PCAs with oblique rotation were conducted on individual scores of (A) CA measures and (B) psychosocial functioning measures. The PCA for CA resulted in two principal components (PCs) which were further divided into a deprivation dimension (blue; PC1 explaining 37% of variance) and a threat dimension (red; PC2 explaining 21% of variance). To account for the contributions of both PCs, we weighted the scores for each PC by their explained variance and subsequently summed these scores to compute a single index of total severity experienced (cumulative CA index). The PCA for psychosocial functioning resulted in three PCs (PC1 explained 55% of variance; PC2 explained 15%; PC3 explained 10%). To compute a cumulative psychosocial functioning index, we summed the weighted PC1, PC2, and PC3 scores. Factor loadings of each measure are displayed on the arrows. \n    \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nFirst, we analysed behavioural data collected at baseline (T1;   N  \u2009=\u2009102). Specifically, we examined associations between friendship quality and CA through linear regression models. We ran separate models for the cumulative CA index (derived through summing the weighted PC1 and PC2 scores) as well as the weighted deprivation (PC1) and threat dimensions (PC2). In addition, we examined associations between friendship quality and the cumulative psychosocial functioning index (hypothesis 1). All models included age at the time of assessment and gender identity as covariates. To handle missing questionnaire data, we derived sum scores from scales with \u226515 items if 85% or more of the items were answered. For scales with less than 15 items, a sum score was only derived if 100% of the items were answered. This resulted in 2.45% of missing data. \n\nSecond, we analysed data collected during the in-unit assessment (T2;   n\u2009  =\u200960). We used a paired   t  -test to examine individual mean differences in state anxiety before and after completing the MIST in the MRI scanner. Afterwards, we investigated overall task effects in our predefined ROIs (hypothesis 2) and then examined associations between CA and friendship quality on stress-induced significant ROI reactivity during stress (> control) trials of the MIST (hypothesis 3). We ran separate moderated multiple regression models for the cumulative CA index, the deprivation, and threat dimensions. All multiple regression models included age at the time of scanning and gender identity as covariates. As our stressor comprised of a timed arithmetic test, we further added IQ as a covariate to all models. Furthermore, friendship quality scores were mean centred to align the scaling of the predictor variables and thereby enhance interpretation of the multiple regression results (Iacobucci et al.,  ). \n\nAll statistical analyses outlined above were run in R version 3.6.3 (R Core Team,  ). The PCAs were performed using the psych R package (version 2.2.9; [Revelle,  ]) and mean imputations to replace missing values were performed using the mice R package (version 3.15.0; [van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn,  ]). Regression models were run using the stats R package (version 3.6.3). Partial Cohen\u2019s f-squared ( ) and Cohen\u2019s d (  d  ) effect size estimates are reported for all relevant tests. Significance was set at   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 throughout all analyses unless stated otherwise and all tests were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons (# of models tested). In addition, we used the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) method (i.e. median plus or minus 3 times the MAD; [Leys et al.,  ]) in combination with the Rosner\u2019s test (EnvStats R package version 2.7.0; [Millard,  ]) to detect and exclude potential outliers. Moreover, to visualise significant interactions, we plotted model estimated marginal means using the sjPlot R package (version 2.8.14; [L\u00fcdecke,  ]) alongside 95% confidence intervals. Specifically, we explored how the relationship between CA and stress-induced ROI reactivity changed as a function of low and high friendship quality (\u22121  SD  , +1  SD  ). For statistical power considerations, please refer to the supplementary information (section F). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioural results (T1;   N  \u2009=\u2009102) \n  \nFirst, we did not observe that participants with more severe retrospectively self-reported CA experiences self-reported lower friendship quality,   \u03b2  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.19, SE\u2009=\u2009.01,   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22121.89,   p  \u2009=\u2009.062 ( A). Next, we observed that models specifying either deprivation or threat experiences as a predictor showed a better model fit compared to a model specifying cumulative CA (see supplementary information for full details). However, none of these dimensional models significantly predicted differences in friendship quality (deprivation experiences:   \u03b2  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.16, SE\u2009=\u2009.01,   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22121.57,   p  \u2009=\u2009.120; threat experiences:   \u03b2  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.17, SE\u2009=\u2009.01,   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22121.65,   p  \u2009=\u2009.103). Second, we found that greater subjectively perceived friendship quality was significantly related to better psychosocial functioning in young people with CA,   \u03b2  \u2009=\u20090.44, SE\u2009=\u2009.02,   t  \u2009=\u20094.87,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,  \u2009=\u2009.245,   R  \u2009=\u2009.207 ( B). Finally, we observed no significant associations between CA (including cumulative index, threat, or deprivation experiences) and psychosocial functioning,   p  \u2019s\u2009>\u2009.235. Please see our supplementary information for the full model output, descriptive statistics, and correlations between the study variables (sections G-H).\n   \nAssociations between friendship quality and (A) Childhood adversity and (B) Psychosocial functioning. \n\nNote. Participants with greater subjectively perceived friendship quality (A) did not retrospectively self-reported less negative CA (  p  \u2009=\u2009.062) but (B) showed better psychosocial functioning (  p  \u2009<\u2009.001). Index scores of CA comprise two weighted principal components (PCs) and index scores of psychosocial functioning comprise three weighted PCs, both oblique rotated. Both y-axes represent factor scores with M\u2009=\u20090 and SD\u2009=\u20091. Brighter shading (green) of individual data points represents (A) less severe CA and (B) better psychosocial functioning on each graph respectively. The black lines show the best-fitting linear regression lines, and the shaded regions around them represent the 95% confidence intervals. \n    \n\n\n### Neuroimaging results (T2;   n  \u2009=\u200960) \n  \n#### State anxiety before and after acute psychosocial stress \n  \nWe observed a significant increase in self-reported state anxiety upon completion of the MIST (  M  \u2009=\u200929.19,   SD\u2009  =\u20095.75;   M  \u2009=\u200934.88,   SD\u2009  =\u200911.57),   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22124.33,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   d  \u2009=\u2009.568, suggesting that our task successfully induced subjective emotional stress ( ).\n   \nState anxiety increased after acute psychosocial stress. \n\nNote. Participants exhibited greater self-reported state anxiety after completing the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST) compared to state anxiety levels before the MIST (  p  \u2009<\u2009.001). The boxplot displays the median (Mdn, solid vertical line) and interquartile range (IQR) before (Mdn\u2009=\u200929.00, IQR\u2009=\u200910) and after (Mdn\u2009=\u200933.00, IQR\u2009=\u200917.75) completing the MIST. The points represent individual datapoints with the grey lines connecting paired observations. ***   p  \u2009<\u2009.001. \n    \n\n\n#### Brain responses to acute psychosocial stress \n  \nFirst, we investigated the main effect of stress (> control) in our predefined ROIs (hippocampus, amygdala, insula, mPFC (ACC), NAc, and thalamus) using familywise error (FWE) correction (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05) at the voxel level. This analysis identified significant activation in the left hippocampus (  t  \u2009=\u20094.24,   p  \u2009=\u2009.007; MNI coordinates: \u221227, \u221237, \u22124), bilateral insula (  t  \u2009=\u20094.07,   p  \u2009=\u2009.020; MNI coordinates: \u221242, 14, 5), left mPFC (ACC) (  t  \u2009=\u20094.35,   p  \u2009=\u2009.043; MNI coordinates: \u22123, 16, 38), right NAc (  t  \u2009=\u20093.09,   p  \u2009=\u2009.016; MNI coordinates: 15, 11, \u221210), and bilateral thalamus (  t  \u2009=\u20095.22,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001; MNI coordinates: 12, \u221210, 14). All significant task-related ROI clusters are summarised in   and visualised in   below. Whole-brain analyses (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05) revealed no significant activation outside our predefined ROIs.\n   \nOverview of neural activation during acute psychosocial stress (> control). \n\nNote. Displayed are   t  -values of neural activation (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05) during stress (> control) trials of the Montreal Imaging Stress Task. Results are presented (A) centred at the left hippocampus region of interest (MNI coordinates: x\u2009=\u2009\u221227, y\u2009=\u2009\u221237, z\u2009=\u2009\u22124) and (B) as axial slices with corresponding   z  -coordinates. L\u2009=\u2009left; R\u2009=\u2009right. \n      \nROIs activated during stress (> control) trials of the Montreal Imaging Stress Task. \n    \n\n\n#### Moderation effect of friendship quality \n  \nTo examine whether perceived friendship quality was related to lower neural stress responses, we ran three separate linear regression models for each of our five predefined ROIs. Specifically, we examined the interaction between friendship quality and cumulative CA, deprivation, or threat experiences. These analyses revealed only a significant threat experiences x friendship quality interaction on left hippocampal reactivity,   \u03b2  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.33, SE\u2009=\u2009.26,   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22122.26,   p  \u2009=\u2009.029,  \u2009=\u2009.111,   R  \u2009=\u2009.142 ( ). However, this effect did not survive correction for multiple comparisons (  p  \u2009=\u2009.145; corrected for five ROI comparisons). Age had a significant effect on left hippocampal reactivity across all analyses, with older participants showing increased left hippocampal reactivity. No other main effects or interactions were observed in any of our analyses (  p  \u2019s\u2009>\u2009.050).\n   \nExploratory average marginal effects in the interaction of threat experiences and friendship quality on left hippocampal reactivity to acute stress. \n\nNote. Friendship quality had a weak moderating effect on the relationship between threat experiences and left hippocampal reactivity to acute stress (  p  \u2009=\u2009.029), such that hippocampal reactivity increased with more negative threat experiences in participants reporting low friendship quality. However, this effect did not survive correction for multiple comparisons (  p  \u2009=\u2009.145; corrected for five ROI comparisons). The lines show the estimated marginal means of threat experiences (x-axis; second weighted PC) on left hippocampal reactivity (y-axis; beta weights) at different values of friendship quality (\u22121SD\u2009=\u200924.31; +1SD\u2009=\u200931.05) with a pointwise 95% confidence interval, derived from a multiple linear regression model. \n    \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we examined whether perceived friendship quality was related to better mental health and well-being (  N  \u2009=\u2009102) and lower neural stress responses using the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (  n  \u2009=\u200962) in young people (aged 16\u201326) with low to moderate CA. In addition, we examined the relation between CA and friendship quality. A principal component analysis revealed two dimensions of CA resembling threat or deprivation like experiences. Hence, we investigated both cumulative and dimension specific effects of CA (Evans et al.,  ; Sheridan & McLaughlin,  ). Contrary to the social transactional model of mental health vulnerability (McCrory et al.,  ), we found no support for social thinning after CA, meaning that the severity of CA (neither cumulative nor dimension specific) did not differentially impact friendship quality. Higher friendship quality, on the other hand, was strongly associated with better psychosocial functioning. Furthermore, we found that experimentally induced acute stress increased state anxiety and enhanced neural activity in five frontolimbic regions (left hippocampus, bilateral insula, left mPFC (ACC), right NAc, and bilateral thalamus). Finally, we found weak support that threat experiences interacted with friendship quality to predict left hippocampal reactivity to acute stress. However, this effect did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Therefore, future research is needed to examine whether friendships aid neural responses to acute stress in young people with childhood threat experiences. \n\nDespite the prominence of research suggesting that CA can lead to impoverished social networks (Horan & Widom,  ; McCrory et al.,  ; Nevard et al.,  ; Sheikh et al.,  ; Sperry & Widom,  ), we observed that neither conceptualisation of CA (i.e. cumulative, deprivation, or threat) was associated with lower friendship quality. Our findings are in fact aligned with previous longitudinal studies by (Miller et al.,  ; van Harmelen et al.,  ) who showed that CA was not directly associated with poor friendships in healthy community samples. In addition, (Fritz et al.,  ) even showed that CA predicted higher friendship quality at ages 14 and 18. The absence of social thinning in our sample may suggest that the risk of developing impoverished social networks is low for rather well-functioning young people with low to moderate CA. This assumption is further supported by our finding that neither conceptualisation of CA was related to subsequent psychosocial functioning. Furthermore, we showed that higher friendship quality was strongly associated with better psychosocial functioning. This is in line with previous research showing that social support provided by friends, family, or significant others is related to better mental health and well-being in samples with CA (Jaffee,  ; Lagdon et al.,  ; Salazar et al.,  ; van Harmelen et al.,  ,  ; Vranceanu et al.,  ). \n\nNext, we found that high-quality friendships aided left hippocampal reactivity to acute stress in young people with childhood threat experiences. While this interaction effect did not survive stringent correction for multiple comparisons, we recognise the value in cautiously aligning our uncorrected findings with previous research. For example, recent work by (Tang et al.,  ) showed that low, but not high, levels of friendship quality facilitated blunted sympathetic nervous system reactivity to social rejection feedback, linking early institutionalisation (i.e. severe deprivation experiences) with later-life peer problems. In contrast, (Fritz et al.,  ) utilised a cumulative-risk approach to quantify CA and found that friendship support at ages 14 or 17 was not associated with neural responses to social rejection at age 18. Consequently, our results align with previous findings that have shown friendship stress buffering through dimensional, but not cumulative, approaches, despite some divergence regarding the specific dimensions investigated. However, it is worth noting that (Tang et al.,  ) did not formally examine different dimensions of early experiences in their sample. \n\nGiven the established association between past threat experiences and hippocampal neurodevelopment, our uncorrected findings regarding friendship stress buffering on hippocampal functioning are particularly interesting. The hippocampus is a subcortical region which develops mainly in the first two years of life, and is vital for learning, memory, spatial navigation, and emotional processing (Bird & Burgess,  ; Phelps,  ). The hippocampus also plays an important role in inhibiting HPA axis activity in response to elevated blood glucocorticoid levels (Lupien et al.,  ). Due to its dense innervation with glucocorticoid receptors, the hippocampus is particularly sensitive to chronic or repeated stress exposure. Both animal and human studies have shown that early onset and increased severity of CA, specifically threat exposure, was associated with structural and functional alterations in the hippocampus, which in turn was identified as a risk factor for later-life psychopathology (Chen et al.,  ; Cohodes et al.,  ). For example, reductions in hippocampal volume were consistently observed in children and adolescents with past threat experiences, which partially mediated the relationship between threat exposure and internalising (Weissman et al.,  ) and externalising problems (Hanson et al.,  ), whilst also being associated with reduced friendship support (Malhi et al.,  ). Furthermore, hippocampal hyperreactivity to acute stress has been reported in young adults with cumulative CA (Seo et al.,  ) and middle-aged adults with emotional maltreatment (Leicht-Deobald et al.,  ). Interestingly, such hippocampal hyperreactivity to acute stress was associated with greater adverse health symptoms (Seo et al.,  ). In other words, reductions in hippocampal volume and functioning may act as a potential mechanism of stress vulnerability in young people with CA. In line with this claim, CA has been linked with a greater sensitivity towards peer rejection (van Harmelen et al.,  ) and a greater likelihood of experiencing interpersonal stress (Benedini et al.,  ; Handley et al.,  ; van Harmelen et al.,  ; Widom et al.,  ). Through this process, CA experiences are thought to reduce an individual\u2019s likelihood to form and maintain long-lasting, high-quality relationships (Labella et al.,  ; McLafferty et al.,  ). Again, an effect we did not observe in the current study, despite other studies reporting impoverished social networks in individuals with CA (Horan & Widom,  ; Nevard et al.,  ; Sperry & Widom,  ). Regardless, our findings, as well as those from other studies, consistently demonstrate a strong association between high-quality friendships and better mental health outcomes in young people with CA. \n\nOur findings are considered in the context of important limitations. First, the current study design prohibits causal inferences. Future large-scale, longitudinal, prospective, and genetically sensitive studies are needed to draw conclusions about the causal impact of CA on neurocognitive and social functioning and the relationship to mental health vulnerability (Danese & Lewis,  ; McCrory et al.,  ). Second, the data collection period of this study was cut short due to re-allocation of the clinical research facilities in Cambridge, UK during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a small neuroimaging sample (  n  \u2009=\u200962). Although a retrospective power analysis confirmed that the sample size was sufficient to detect large effects, future research is needed to validate and extend our findings. Despite previous research indicating that stress can induce laterality changes in the hippocampus (Riem et al.,  ), we refrained from interpreting our laterality findings as these might be driven by our stringent significance threshold and reduced sample size. Third, the value of dimensional approaches for conceptualising CA and identifying mechanisms shaping developmental outcomes is actively being debated (McLaughlin et al.,  ; Pollak & Smith,  ). The current study suggests that continuously assessing the severity of different CA dimensions may be helpful for specifying putative neural mechanisms that potentially increase mental health vulnerability (McLaughlin et al.,  ; Puetz et al.,  ). In addition, future work should consider the developmental timing and chronicity of exposure to holistically understand the detrimental impact CA can have on the developing brain and consequently on neurocognitive and social functioning. Similarly, future work should account for differential friendship dimensions, such as intimacy, loyalty, frequency of engagement, or network size, as well as differences in stress paradigms with regards to type, intensity, and duration of acute stress, to gain a more nuanced mechanistic understanding about friendship stress buffering after CA. It is worth noting that our sample self-reported on average high levels of friendship quality suggesting a well-functioning group of young people. Nevertheless, current individual characteristics, such as mental health vulnerabilities, may have biased the reporting of friendship quality, in that relationships may be perceived as more negative (Baldwin & Degli Esposti,  ; Colman et al.,  ). However, this concern seems negligible given that we successfully replicated previous longitudinal findings showing a strong link between high-quality friendships and better mental health in samples with low to moderate CA (van Harmelen et al.,  ,  ,  ). Furthermore, in our sample, we found no association between CA and psychosocial functioning, which is at odds with robust associations reported in the literature (Humphreys et al.,  ; McCrory et al.,  ; Shackman & Pollak,  ; Sheikh et al.,  ). It is plausible that the remote assessment of CA and psychosocial functioning in our study may have introduced some limitations to the validity of these measures in our particular sample. However, remote psychosocial functioning assessments have demonstrated adequate psychometric properties (van Ballegooijen et al.,  ) and strong internal consistency (Brock et al.,  ) in previous studies. Furthermore, our remote assessment of the MFQ at T1 exhibited a moderate correlation with the MFQ assessment we conducted in the laboratory at T2 (  r  \u2009=\u2009.69,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001). Additionally, all our questionnaires demonstrated acceptable to excellent internal consistency at baseline, and we successfully replicated the above mentioned large-scale longitudinal findings (van Harmelen et al.,  ,  ). Given these considerations, it is possible that the absence of a relationship between CA and psychosocial functioning in our sample can be attributed to the fact that our sample consisted of relatively well-functioning young people who reported only low to moderate CA. \n\nIn conclusion, we showed that young people with more severe CA did not self-report lower friendship quality. However, higher friendship quality was strongly associated with better psychosocial functioning. We found only weak support that threat experiences interacted with friendship quality to predict left hippocampal reactivity to acute stress. However, this effect did not survive correction for multiple comparisons and therefore requires replication in larger ideally longitudinal samples. Hence, future research is needed to examine whether friendships aid neural responses to acute stress in young people with childhood threat experiences. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10990450, "text_md5": "824f5b1f9b6fddf11554d4b213d5c5c4", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 191], "journal": [192, 213], "publication_year": [215, 219], "title": [230, 342], "keywords": [356, 612], "abstract": [625, 3050], "body": [3059, 53347]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 38154076, "doi": "10.1080/20008066.2023.2281971", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10990450", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10990450"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10990450\">10990450</a>", "list_title": "PMC10990450  The stress-buffering role of friendships in young people with childhood threat experiences: a preliminary report"}

The literature on normative neurodevelopment implicates aberrant activation of affective and regulatory regions as key to inhibitory failures. However, many of these studies have not included adolescents engaging in high rates of risky behavior, making generalizations to the most at-risk populations potentially problematic. We conducted a comparative study of nondelinquent community (  n  \u2009=\u200924, mean age\u2009=\u200915.8\u00a0years, 12 female) and delinquent adolescents (  n  \u2009=\u200924, mean age\u2009=\u200916.2\u00a0years, 12 female) who completed a cognitive control task during functional magnetic resonance imaging, where behavioral inhibition was assessed in the presence of appetitive and aversive socioaffective cues. Community adolescents showed poorer behavioral regulation to appetitive relative to aversive cues, whereas the delinquent sample showed the opposite pattern. Recruitment of the inferior frontal gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, and tempoparietal junction differentiated community and high-risk adolescents, as delinquent adolescents showed significantly greater recruitment when inhibiting their responses in the presence of aversive cues, while the community sample showed greater recruitment when inhibiting their responses in the presence of appetitive cues. Accounting for behavioral history may be key in understanding when adolescents will have regulatory difficulties, highlighting a need for comparative research into normative and nonnormative risk-taking trajectories. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAdolescence is often described as a paradoxical time, where relative improvements in certain domains (e.g. abstract reasoning) are often coupled with suboptimal decision making in other domains (e.g. health risk behaviors;  ). Much of this paradox has been attributed to the outsized role that affective processing plays in adolescents\u2019 lives (Somerville, Hare & Casey, 2011). Specifically, adolescents\u2019 ability to regulate their behavior is particularly affected by socioaffective cues ( ;  ), which may explain the onset of negative outcomes like psychopathology ( ) and increased risk taking ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), and rises in delinquency ( ). Developmental neuroscience research has speculated that suboptimal behaviors like delinquency may be driven, in part, by neural changes that make adolescents more susceptible to disinhibited responses. While such work has aided in theorizing how neuroscience can inform the treatment of adolescents engaging in high rates of disruptive behaviors ( ;  ), it is unclear if these normative increases in risk taking are explanatory for the youth actively engaging in high-risk behaviors. \n\nNeuroscientific inquiries have found socioaffective stimuli\u2014both negatively and positively valenced\u2014to impact regulation in adolescents, although the specific effect has not been consistent. A number of studies have found that aversive stimuli\u2014such as fearful faces (Grose-Fifer, et\u00a0al., 2014;  ), negative affective images ( ), and threat cues ( )\u2014are particularly deleterious to regulatory capacities, whereas others have found that compromised regulation may be more specific to appetitive stimuli\u2014such as happy faces ( ), positive affective images ( ), and the presence of peers ( ). The nature of this discrepancy is of great importance, as it suggests adolescent dysregulation in response to socioaffective stimuli is complex and likely driven by more than merely the type of stimuli observed. \n\nSuch divergent findings may be reflective of differences in the participants\u2019 lived experiences. For example, increased focus on appetitive socioaffective cues may theoretically help adolescents identify and act on opportunities to increase their status within their respective social hierarchies (Nelson, Jarcho, & Guyer, 2016). Not all social groups are alike, and for some adolescents, dysregulation in aversive or threatening situations may place them at an increased risk of negative consequences. Furthermore, research has shown that environmental inputs often change behavior ( ), with a particular focus on the impact of unstable environments and their role in behavioral reactivity ( ). What is valuable within a given environment will vary, and the socioaffective cues relevant to those consistently engaging in delinquency may fundamentally differ from their nondelinquent community counterparts. Perhaps those engaging in delinquency demonstrate behavioral and neural adaptations necessary for surviving and rising in disruptive environments ( ). Alternatively, past delinquent behavior may alter processing that impacts future decision making in ways not applicable to normative samples ( ). To better understand how affective processing difficulties may lead some adolescents astray, more inquiries need to focus on how, when, and for whom affective stimuli are problematic, as increased generalizability to diverse samples may highlight developmental issues currently overlooked ( ). \n\nThe interplay between subcortical affective circuitry and regulatory cortical regions has been highlighted in accounts of adolescent disinhibition. Volumetric and functional changes in social cognition regions [e.g. the fusiform face area, superior temporal sulcus, and temporoparietal junction (TPJ);  ) and increases in neural activation of affective circuitry (e.g. amygdala ( ), ventral striatum ( )], coupled with aberrant activity in regulatory regions [e.g. inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC);  ], are reported in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research with adolescent samples. These neural changes are proposed to reorient cognitive resources toward salient socioaffective cues and away from regulatory processing ( ;  ;  ;  ). The amygdala and ventral striatum show greater responsivity to appetitive socioaffective cues in adolescence, which may override inhibition ( ;  ). The recruitment of prefrontal regions implicated in executive functioning [such as the IFG (Aron, Robbins & Poldrack., 2014) and the mPFC ( )] is necessary to successfully inhibit and override the attentional resources engaged in the presence of salient affective cues ( ). Given the role these regulatory regions have shown in successful inhibition in the presence of salient stimuli ( ;  ;  ;  ), they likely play a key role in adolescents\u2019 ability to successfully focus on the task at hand and away from distracting salient information (Fukada & Vogel, 2009;  ;  ). \n\nIn the current study, a low-risk community and high-risk delinquent sample of adolescents completed a modified go/no-go task ( ) during which participants were instructed to inhibit a prepotent behavioral response while distracted by socioaffective cues, which were either appetitive or aversive social stimuli. We assessed how the presence of these cues differentially impacted inhibitory and neural responses. By comparatively assessing the influence of socioaffective cues on both delinquent and community adolescents, we aimed to extend normative neurodevelopmental work into a high-risk population. There is a need to test whether regulatory problems observed in delinquent adolescents are different from their community peers in terms of the magnitude (i.e. same patterns of behavior and brain across appetitive and aversive contexts, but higher overall deficits in the delinquent sample) or context (i.e. different patterns of behavior and brain across appetitive and aversive contexts) in order to correctly conceptualize disinhibition leading to psychosocial dysfunction. \n\nOn the one hand, current theory suggests social reorientation may impact all adolescents along a continuum ( ), such that the patterns of behavioral and neural processes are pointed in the same direction, in which case delinquent adolescents may represent more extreme examples of disinhibition relative to their nondelinquent community counterparts ( ). However, we argue that, rather than showing overall greater difficulty to the same cues, delinquent adolescents\u2019 disinhibition may differ based on the socioaffective context they are experiencing. Adolescents with behavioral issues may have adapted to their environment in such a fashion that social reorientation directs attention to cues of threat or those that evoke aversive affective states. Thus, adolescents engaging in disruptive behaviors may find aversive cues more salient, as this may signify oncoming danger, whereas appetitive cues may be more salient for nondelinquent samples, as processing these cues may provide adolescents opportunities to rise in their social hierarchy. In other words, the process of a social reorientation may be universal, in that attentional resources at this developmental stage are disproportionately directed toward socioaffective cues in the environment ( ), but the cues that are salient may differ based on life experience and behavioral profile. Clarifying the nature of inhibitory responses to socioaffective cues in adolescence may provide valuable insight into explaining what differentiates those undergoing normative development from those actively engaged in high-risk behaviors. \n\nIn the current study, we hypothesized that socioaffective cues would lead to greater recruitment of attentional resources ( ) and greater disruption in task performance in an implicit emotion regulation task. We predicted that the emotion regulation difficulties observed in the task would depend on the behavioral profiles (low-risk community, high-risk delinquent) of the adolescents. Specifically, community youth will show greater disruption to appetitive cues ( ), while high-risk youth will show greater disruption to aversive cues ( ). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA total of 51 adolescents were recruited, with a total of 48 adolescents included in the final sample after removing participants unsuitable for analyses [one participant was removed due to an inability to adequately complete the scanning protocol (as determined by poor task comprehension during training and excessive movement throughout the scanning protocol), and two others chose to not complete the scanning session]. The community and delinquent sample each included 24 participants (see   for demographic breakdown of both samples). Given that disciplinary contacts with school (e.g. suspensions and expulsions) and legal institutions (e.g. arrests) in adolescence have been linked with continued criminal behavior ( ;  ;  ), we recruited participants engaging in antisocial behaviors that resulted in institutional involvement (e.g. property theft, fighting, drug use and/or sale, weapon use, etc. leading to disciplinary actions). We recruited the delinquent sample from (i) an alternative school for students who have been expelled or suspended (ii), the local juvenile detention center, and (iii) the local parole and probation office. To provide greater clarity regarding the scope of delinquency and institutional discipline, the numbers of suspensions, expulsions, and arrests were collected in the delinquent sample ( ). Participants in the community sample were recruited from traditional schools in the same geographic area. Participants were compensated US $50. Informed consent and assent were obtained for participants in accordance with the university\u2019s institutional review board. \n  \nDemographic information for community and delinquent adolescents \n    \nDisciplinary history of delinquent sample \n  \n\n### Experimental paradigm: Go/No-Go and social Go/No-Go task \n  \nWhile completing an fMRI scan, participants completed both a control go/no-go, which was used solely to establish baseline cognitive performance in the absence of socioaffective cues, and a social go/no-go task ( ) adapted from prior research ( ), which was used to assess emotion regulation in the context of socioaffective cues. The control go/no-go task consisted of four blocks, each containing 25 trials. The control task was completed prior to the social go/no-go, which included four aversive and four appetitive blocks, which were presented in a randomized order. Participants were presented with blocks of socially appetitive or aversive scenes for 300\u00a0ms, after which a letter was superimposed on the image for 500\u00a0ms. During this 500\u00a0ms window, participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible by pushing a button for every letter shown (\u2018go\u2019) except the letter \u2018X\u2019 (\u2018no-go\u2019). The control go/no-go task was identical in design structure, but did not include superimposed images (rather, a white square was presented on a black screen for 300\u00a0ms, after which a black letter was superimposed on the white background for 500\u00a0ms). In both task variants, 28% of the trials were no-go trials, which created a prepotent response to press, requiring inhibition on no-go trials. A jittered Intertrial interval (ITI) was presented between trials, averaging 1200\u00a0ms. In total, the social go/no-go consisted of 100 trials per condition across eight randomized blocks. Socially appetitive blocks included scenes of people celebrating, cooperating, and being affiliative, while socially aversive blocks included scenes of people excluding one another, bullying peers, and showing negative affect (see   for selection and reliability of the stimuli). The task was programmed and presented using E-Prime 2.0 (2012). \n\nTo assess for behavioral performance, we chose to use   d  \u2019 as our behavioral measure of emotion regulation ( ).   d  \u2019 is an index originating from signal detection theory in which the normalized rate of correct discrimination of a signal (\u2018hits\u2019) is compared to the normalized rate of false attributions of signal due to noise (\u2018false alarms\u2019) ( ;  ). Given that socioaffective stimuli may alter a number of psychological processes,   d  \u2019 is an ideal metric given its incorporation of multiple signal (correct hits and correct inhibition) and noise (incorrect misses and false alarms) components. In this experiment, a \u2018hit\u2019 was defined as making a button press when appropriately required to (i.e. on go trials), and a false alarm was defined as making a button press when inappropriate to do so (i.e. on no-go trials).   d  \u2019 was calculated for each participant by subtracting their normalized (  Z  ) score of false alarm rates from their normalized (  Z  ) score of hit rates; thus,   d  \u2019 for each condition equaled   Z  \u2009\u2212\u2009  Z   (Macmillan & Creelman, 1991).   d  \u2019 was calculated separately for socially appetitive and socially aversive blocks as well as the baseline control task. Calculating   d  \u2019 within condition provided an index of how well participants performed with and without affective stimuli, where greater   d  \u2019 values indicate better performance on the task (i.e. more effective inhibition coupled with less disinhibition). Utilizing a control go/no-go is optimal for establishing baseline rates of inhibitory control. Given that emotional stimuli are more engaging than the control condition, and our stated focus on how adolescent decision making is specifically affected in social contexts ( ), we examined how socioaffective cues (appetitive versus aversive) may have distinct effects on emotion regulation on the social go/no-go. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nImaging data were collected with a 3 T Siemens TRI MRI scanner. T2 -weighted, matched-bandwidth, high-resolution anatomical scan [repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20094\u00a0s; echo time (TE)\u2009=\u200964\u00a0ms; field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009230; matrix\u2009=\u2009192x192; slice thickness\u2009=\u20093\u00a0mm; 38 slices], and T1  magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE; TR\u2009=\u20091.9\u00a0s; TE\u2009=\u20092.3\u00a0ms; FOV\u2009=\u2009230; matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256; sagittal plane; slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u00a0mm; 192 slices) scans were acquired as structural images. Each condition of the experimental paradigm comprised 120 T2-weighted echoplanar images (EPI; slick thickness\u2009=\u20093\u00a0mm, 38 slices; TR\u2009=\u20092\u00a0s; matrix\u2009=\u200992x92; FOV\u2009=\u2009230\u00a0mm; voxel size of 3x3x3 mm). An oblique axial orientation was used to maximized coverage area and reduce signal dropout for the T2 images. \n  \nWithin-group comparisons of   d  \u2019 as a function of task condition \n  \n\n### fMRI data preprocessing and analysis \n  \nData preprocessing and analysis were conducted using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College, London, UK). Functional images were spatially realigned in order to correct for movement (no participant exceeded 3\u00a0mm of maximum image to image motion in any direction for more than 5% of their echoplanar images). The images were coregistered to each participant\u2019s high-resolution MPRAGE and segmented into cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter, and white matter. A normalization transformation matrix was applied to the functional and T2 structural images, thereby converting each participant\u2019s data into the standard stereotactic space specified by the Montreal Neurological Institute. Normalized functional data were smoothed using an 8-mm Gaussian kernel (full width at half maximum). A restricted maximum likelihood algorithm, with an autoregressive model order of 1, was used to address serial autocorrelations, and a high-pass filter with a 128-s cutoff was applied to remove low-frequency noise. \n\nData were analyzed using the general linear model (GLM) in the SPM software. At the individual level, a fixed-effects analysis was modeled with a block design, in which all individual trials were modeled within each block (800-ms duration) for each condition (socially appetitive, socially aversive), so that null events (i.e. jittered ITIs) served as the implicit baseline. To model inhibitory processing, a parametric modulator (PM) was included for each trial in participants\u2019 first level model for the conditions of interest (appetitive or aversive socioaffective cues) to represent behavioral accuracy. We represented successful completion of an individual trial, such that 1\u2009=\u2009correct response (correct hit or \u2018go\u2019 and correct inhibition or \u2018no-go\u2019) and 0\u2009=\u2009incorrect response (incorrect hit or \u2018false alarm\u2019 and not responding on go trials \u2018miss\u2019). The PM isolates neural responses linked to behavioral performance on the task (i.e. successful inhibition relative to failed inhibition), allowing us to identify regions specifically recruited for successful relative to unsuccessful behavioral performance. Significant voxels represent brain regions that show parametrically greater activation to correct versus incorrect trials based on the given condition of interest (socially appetitive or socially aversive). \n\nParameter estimates from the GLM were used to create linear contrasts for comparisons of interest (socially appetitive > socially aversive) at the group level. Random-effects, whole-brain analyses were conducted in order to examine group differences between delinquent and community adolescents. To correct for multiple comparisons at the group level, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation using the AFNI software package\u2019s 3dClustSim command for the group-level brain mask ( ) and corrected for intrinsic smoothing, which was estimated using the 3dFWHMx command and acf. Results of the simulation indicated that a family-wise error\u2013corrected rate of   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 would be achieved with a voxel-wise threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.005 and a minimum cluster size of 132 voxels. Age, gender, and ethnicity (white, black, and other) were controlled in all analyses. All neural analyses are available on Neurovault ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nTo examine behavioral differences between the low-risk community and high-risk delinquent samples, we used   to conduct a repeated-measures GLM with one within-subject variable (task condition: control, appetitive, aversive) and one between-subject variable (group: community, delinquent), while controlling for self-reported ethnicity, age, and gender. The effects of task (  F  (2,74)\u2009=\u2009.128) and group (  F  (1,37)\u2009=\u20092.548) were not statistically significant, but there was a significant condition-by-group interaction (  F  (1,74)\u2009=\u200913.419,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, \u03b7 \u2009=\u2009.266). We used paired-samples   t  -tests to explore the group-by-task interaction effect ( ). In the community sample, inhibitory performance in the control condition (  d  \u2019 \u2009=\u20092.617, SD\u2009=\u20090.475) was significantly better than in both the appetitive (  d  \u2019 \u2009=\u20092.07, SD\u2009=\u20090.537, (  t  (23)\u2009=\u20094.18,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, Cohen   d  \u2009=\u20090.853) and aversive condition {  d  \u2019 \u2009=\u20092.299, SD\u2009=\u20090.541, [  t  (23)\u2009=\u20092.884,   P  \u2009=\u20090.008, Cohen   d  \u2009=\u20090.589]}; additionally, inhibitory performance in the aversive condition was significantly better than in the appetitive condition [  t  (23)\u2009=\u20092.079,   P  \u2009=\u20090.049, Cohen   d  \u2009=\u20090.424]. Inhibitory performance patterns in the delinquent sample differed from the community sample. Specifically, inhibitory performance in the appetitive condition (  d  \u2019 \u2009=\u20092.391, SD\u2009=\u20090.591) was significantly better than in both the control (  d  \u2019 \u2009=\u20092.017, SD\u2009=\u20090.567, (  t  (23)\u2009=\u20093.747,   P  \u2009=\u20090.001, Cohen   d  \u2009=\u20090.765) and aversive condition (  d  \u2019 \u2009=\u20091.647, SD\u2009=\u20090.644, (  t  (23)\u2009=\u20099.469,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20091.932); additionally, inhibitory performance in the control condition was significantly better than in the aversive condition (  t  (23)\u2009=\u20093.318,   P  \u2009=\u20090.003, Cohen   d  \u2009=\u20090.678). In short, the community sample showed greater inhibitory failures to appetitive cues, whereas the delinquent sample showed greater inhibitory failures to aversive cues. These findings suggest emotion-regulation difficulties for members of each group differ based on the socioaffective context, as the delinquent sample shows a different pattern of emotion regulation disruption compared to their community counterparts. \n  \nNeural regions that differentiate group (delinquent, community) and socioaffective condition (socially appetitive\u2009>\u2009socially aversive) linked to successful task performance \n  \nNote. R refers to right and L refers to left;   x  ,   y  , and   z  , to Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates;   t  ,   t  -score at those coordinates (local maxima);   k  , number of contiguous voxels; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; mPFC, medial prefrontal cortex; TPJ, temporal parietal junction. \n  \n\n### Neuroimaging results \n  \nGiven that both behavioral profile and cue type produced a significant interaction effect on behavioral disruption, we next examined regions tied to successful task completion between groups. We conducted a two-sample (delinquent vs. community) whole-brain   t  -test comparing neural activation on the main contrast of interest (socially appetitive cues\u2009>\u2009socially aversive cues), using the PM for successful task completion relative to task failures. We observed significant group differences in the bilateral IFG, mPFC, TPJ, cuneus, and brainstem ( ). To understand the nature of interaction, we extracted parameter estimates from the IFG, mPFC, and TPJ clusters to unpack how these regions differentiated inhibitory success as a function of group and cue type. For descriptive purposes, we extracted parameter estimates of signal intensity from each group separately within the aversive and appetitive blocks. As shown in  , delinquent adolescents showed greater recruitment during successful inhibition toward socially aversive cues compared to community adolescents who showed greater recruitment during successful inhibition toward socially appetitive cues, suggesting that recruitment of these regions promoted successful task performance during the cue type where each group showed the most inhibitory failures. This suggests that the IFG, mPFC, and TPJ are involved in successfully inhibiting behavior in the presence of socioaffective cues; however, recruitment is not uniformly observed for all socioaffective cues but depends on the types of cues that underlie emotion-regulation difficulties for each group. Looking solely within the control condition, we see significant activation differences in the posterior cingulate cortex; for the purposes of this article, focused on social cognition, we do not explore this further, although the analysis can be found on Neurovault ( ). Additionally, we conducted an exploratory seed-based functional connectivity analysis using the clusters of activation observed in the mPFC and the IFG. We conducted whole-brain connectivity analyses comparing the two groups using the gPPI toolbox in SPM ( ). We did not observe significant differences between the two groups in connectivity with either region that survived multiple-comparisons threshold correction. \n  \nCommunity and delinquent adolescents show differential tracking of successful inhibition in the left (L) and right (R) inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), and left temporal parietal junction (TPJ). The   y   axis represents parameter estimates of signal intensity from neural regions that tracked with successful task performance. Positive numbers indicate increased recruitment in each region when successfully performing, whereas numbers around 0 indicate the region was not recruited as a function of task performance. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAdolescence is a transitory period, where social information takes on great importance for achieving age-specific goals ( ). The increased focus on socioaffective information guides attention toward cues that may signify a window of opportunity for adolescents to rise socially ( ). However, these opportunities for social advancement may also bear increased risk, and when neural reactivity is coupled with poor regulation, suboptimal outcomes may result ( ). Previous research examining the effects of socioemotional stimuli on adolescents has shown that appetitive cues ( ;  ) are linked with disinhibition at the behavioral and neural level in normative adolescent development. To extend this research to at-risk populations, we compared a community sample to a delinquent sample of adolescents to assess if these groups responded to socioaffective cues similarly (with the main distinction being one of magnitude where delinquent adolescents may show more difficulty with emotion regulation) or if these groups may respond differentially (with delinquent youth showing different patterns of emotion regulation difficulties). We found that the emotion regulation differences between community and delinquent adolescents were not entirely one of magnitude, as community adolescents showed greater difficulties in the presence of appetitive social cues, whereas delinquent adolescents showed greater difficulties in the presence of aversive social cues. \n\nAt the neural level, we observed that recruitment of the IFG, mPFC, and TPJ distinguished the groups. Delinquent adolescents showed significantly greater recruitment of these regions when successfully inhibiting their responses specifically in the presence of aversive cues, whereas the community sample showed greater recruitment in these regions when successfully inhibiting their responses in the presence of appetitive cues. These results suggest that while the same regulatory and social processing regions were recruited during the task, when they were recruited, they differed depending on the group (delinquent, community) and condition (aversive, appetitive). The inclusion of these regions is noteworthy, as they have been implicated in much of the developmental social neuroscience research examining adolescent cognition in social contexts ( ). \n\nInterestingly, recruitment of the IFG and mPFC is greatest when it was most difficult for adolescents to complete the task without error. In particular, community adolescents showed the greatest behavioral disruption to appetitive socioaffective cues, which coincided with greater IFG recruitment, whereas delinquent adolescents showed the greatest behavioral disruption to aversive socioaffective cues, which coincided with greater IFG recruitment. The IFG has been consistently identified as a region implicated in inhibiting behavioral responses broadly ( ;  ), as well as tracking salient information and guiding attentional resources ( ;  ;  ). Hence, it is not surprising that the ability to focus on the go/no-go task while in the presence of affective stimuli was linked with IFG recruitment, as this would rely on inhibiting a disruptive affective response, focusing on task-specific instructions, and guiding attentional resources away from distracting cues. \n\nThe mPFC has been implicated in suboptimal adolescent decision making, specifically in relation to impulsivity ( ) and disruption related to affective stimuli ( ). The mPFC is also linked with tracking errors during cognitive control ( ), as well as negative feedback during risk taking ( ), suggesting that the mPFC may be integral in decision making. Together, our findings suggest that the mPFC aids in monitoring errors and task-irrelevant information, as greater recruitment of this region corresponds to improved performance in conditions that the adolescents found the task most challenging. Ostensibly, the IFG and mPFC were recruited to regulate distracting cues and complete the task; however, when recruitment occurred, they differed between the adolescent groups depending on the socioaffective cues. \n\nA similar pattern was found for the TPJ. The TPJ is implicated in many processes, including social cognition ( ). In adolescence, TPJ activation is tied to observing social cues ( ) and is theorized to be integral in increases in social information processing observed in this time period ( ). While some studies have linked increased TPJ activation with decreased risk taking ( ) and increased prosocial decision making ( ), others have implicated decreased recruitment of the TPJ in improved task performance ( ), and it is consistently activated in adolescent decision making in social contexts ( ). Perhaps the recruitment of the TPJ in the current study is indicative of greater social information processing or attentional capture ( ). Given that community adolescents needed greater regulatory recruitment during the appetitive condition\u2014and vice versa for the delinquent adolescents\u2014it would stand to reason that this recruitment was in response to the adolescents more fully processing cues in the given condition. As our results show, clarifying the role the TPJ plays in social information processing and how that impacts regulatory mechanisms is important in addressing (sub)optimal behaviors in adolescence. \n\nThe differential recruitment of regulatory and social information processing regions in this task suggests that delinquent and community adolescents may fundamentally differ in their processing of socioaffective cues. The presence of affective stimuli is irrelevant to the task behavior (i.e. each subject is supposed to either press or inhibit their response to the letter stimuli, regardless of the background image); however, our results highlight that task-irrelevant affective information can have an outsized role for adolescents. While models of adolescent brain development have postulated that individual difference factors (such as life history and environmental context) likely alter how socioaffective and regulatory systems evolve ( ), such positions until recently have been mostly theoretical ( ;  ;  ). \n\nOur research highlights that while emotional stimuli may be problematic across adolescence, the effect is not uniform and is distinguishable when accounting for behavioral characteristics. Community adolescents had problems with appetitive stimuli\u2014perhaps reflective of disruption in approach to the presence of prosocial cues\u2014while delinquent adolescents had problems with aversive stimuli\u2014perhaps reflective of disruption toward threat or environmental instability, which may be more prevalent in their daily lives ( ;  ). Our task utilized emotional stimuli to indirectly capture attention, requiring adolescents to engage regulatory processing to redirect the adolescent (e.g. the distracting effect of emotion). Tasks that require more explicit focus on emotional stimuli for task completion, such as reading emotional cues, likely invoke different psychological processes ( ;  ), a distinction that may be particularly useful for pinpointing when delinquent adolescents differ from their low-risk counterparts. Historically, studies examining adolescents with conduct issues have observed a broad pattern of physiological hypoactivity (as measured by heart rate, galvanic skin response, eye-blink startle, and neuroimaging studies) to negatively valenced stimuli ( ). The findings presented in this study suggest future research should examine how socioaffective information may be incorporated into decision-making processes irrespective of physiological responsivity, as emotional stimuli are likely to impact behavior even if it does not impact autonomic functioning. Our results provide preliminary evidence to the hypothesis that behavioral profiles may undergird neurodevelopment, as the past behavior of adolescents was related to both when they were likely to be distracted by affective stimuli, and when the same neural regions were recruited to successfully regulate behavior. \n\nWe found that past delinquent acts were a meaningful variable for understanding emotion regulation, as we saw differential neurobehavioral responses. High-risk adolescents\u2019 problematic behaviors may be tied to adapting to aversive social cues and contexts, which suggests that assessing the contextual information surrounding past behavior may be integral to understanding delinquency and sharpening future research inquiries. Disinhibition, in and of itself, is not a universally problematic phenomenon, as acting quickly in response to seeing opportunities for rewarding social gains or threatening contexts may sometimes be beneficial. As the field of developmental neuroscience progresses, the need to apply our findings within the greater context of varying social structures becomes more pertinent ( ). In order for empirically based findings to best inform potential interventions aimed at addressing social problems, it is imperative that we base our results on samples actively engaged in the problems we want to tackle (e.g. delinquency) in relevant situational contexts. Our study suggests that ancillary socioaffective cues are likely to be particularly distracting in adolescence. Future work ought to tackle how disinhibition to varying social stimuli may directly (or indirectly) connect to substance use and antisociality, as the relationship between social disinhibition and antisocial behaviors occurring due to psychopathology is currently not well elucidated. Exploring if these suboptimal outcomes are driven by, or orthogonal to, socially provoked disinhibition will be of great importance for future research. \n\nWhile this study represents an important step toward understanding how individual difference factors need to be accounted for in developmental neuroscience, there are limitations that require future attention. First, because we used a cross-sectional design, we did not explore the progression of emotion regulation in adolescents, which limits our ability to developmentally answer how regulatory ability changes due to learned experience ( ;  ). It is possible that such experiences may alter how individuals perceive socioaffective stimuli in future interactions, a concern we are unable to address in the current study. Future research should examine how individual difference factors (such as behavioral history) alter trajectories of affective perception and the progression of emotion regulation difficulties. By applying both prospective and retrospective analyses that tie neural development to meaningful behavioral differences, researchers may gain insight into critical intervention periods. Future research examining how the development of social cognition is impacted by behavior and the environmental inputs, as well as how that might cascade into the neurodevelopment of regulatory processing, is of the most importance. \n\nSecond, while the distinction between adolescents who offend and those who do not has been shown to be quite meaningful ( ;  ;  ), this assessment is somewhat blunt and oftentimes open to class, gender, and race biases ( ). We attempted to mitigate this concern by selecting a gender- and race-balanced cohort for our high-risk delinquent sample that was from the same region as our community sample, but we recognize that not all acts receive the same type of discipline and that not all disciplinary actions are inherently just or represent equivalently severe transgressions. We believe verifiable evidence of a disciplinary act would be a useful starting point but recognize the need for greater specificity of transgression in future endeavors. While having a continuous measure of verifiable acts of delinquency would be ideal for such a study, verifying such information without secondary sources (e.g. school, police, and social services records), clinical assessments, and parental input is quite difficult. There have been calls for greater specificity and standardization when assessing delinquency, such as focusing on intent, motivational factors, and specific behaviors present in delinquent acts ( ); perhaps this is an avenue the field can proceed down to improve the precision of our findings to the detrimental behaviors delinquent populations may engage in. Quantifying delinquent acts on a number of continuums will allow for greater precision in explaining physiological differences and targets for intervention in future research. \n\nThird, we did not have clinical assessments or other measures aimed at delinquency collected in both groups; future work should incorporate both verifiable evidence and a wide assay of individual difference factors, as variations in social motivation, perceptual processing, and lived experience are theorized to explain much of when and why adolescents focus on socioaffective stimuli ( ). There is a large body of research focusing on externalizing and aggression (see  ;  ;  ) that has by proxy examined delinquent behavior via clinical populations. While certainly valuable, this research base may not be dispositive toward understanding normative increases in adolescent risk taking and how that can result in suboptimal outcomes in nonclinical samples. Part of the complication is that much of the aforementioned research focuses on deficiencies in offending youth ( ). Focusing on antisocial behaviors versus psychometrically assessed constructs associated with antisociality provides different information that may muddy how we understand delinquency and offending populations ( ). Given that research into hierarchical approaches of psychopathology has found that delinquent outcomes are tied to both general dysfunction (the p-factor) and externalizing syndromes ( ), measurement issues and outcome convergence need to be thoughtfully addressed in future research ( ). Future research into adolescent risk taking ought to focus more on recruiting delinquent samples, increased collection of demographic and individual difference variables, and providing as much contextual information regarding past behavior as feasible. Many studies, including this one, are limited by their sample size and time requirements to get fine-grained assessments across individual differences. \n\nOur results help to shed light on the process of successful emotion regulation in adolescents, as well as provide a window into how prior behavior may inform when and why adolescents are likely to engage in specific types of suboptimal decision making. The cues that lead adolescents without prior histories of delinquency astray may not be equivalent for adolescents already engaging in delinquent acts. Emotion regulation difficulties across different adolescents are specific to both behavioral history and social context, and research surrounding how to best understand and ultimately intervene upon problematic adolescent outcomes ought to account for this discrepancy. This study provides a useful comparative analysis, showing that emotion regulation failures seen across adolescence require accounting for behavior profile, as community adolescents\u2019 emotion regulation difficulties were qualitatively different from delinquent adolescents. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis manuscript was partially supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF SES 1459719 to E.H.T. and NSF Graduate Fellowship 2\u2009016\u2009220\u2009797 to J.F.G.M.), the National Institute of Drug Abuse (R01DA039923 to E.H.T.), the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH 2T32MH100019-06 to J.L.L. & D.M.B.) and generous funds from the Department of Psychology at the University of Illinois.

This study tested whether four FTD dimensions differ in their association with brain perfusion and brain structure. \n\n\n## Study Design \n  \nThis cross-sectional study investigated 110 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders using 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The Thought and Language Disorder scale (TALD) was utilized, which comprises four subscales: Objective Positive (OP), Objective Negative (ON), Subjective Positive (SP), and Subjective Negative (SN). Resting-state cerebral blood flow (rsCBF), cortical thickness (CortTh), gray matter volume (GMV), and diffusion MRI tractography were tested for associations with TALD subscales controlling for age, medication, total intracranial volume, and for variance of the 3 other TALD subscales. \n\n\n## Study Results \n  \nFollowing Bonferroni correction, the FTD dimensions presented distinct neural correlates. OP scores were associated with increased rsCBF and increased GMV in the right cerebellum lingual gyrus. Higher SP scores were linked to increased GMV in bilateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, ON was associated with increased GMV in the right premotor cortex. At more liberal statistical thresholds, higher SP was associated with increased CortTh in the right inferior frontal gyrus, whereas SN scores were linked to decreased GMV in the right prefrontal lobe, the left inferior temporal gyrus, and the left supplementary motor area. Unadjusted analyses mostly corroborated these findings. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThese findings stress the heterogeneity in FTD, suggesting distinct neural patterns for specific FTD experiences. In sum, FTD in psychosis may require distinct treatment strategies and further mechanistic investigations on single-item levels. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFormal thought disorder (FTD) is a multidimensional syndrome in many psychiatric disorders that may also occur in healthy subjects. It is a core symptom in schizophrenia with a prevalence of about 50%\u201380%.  FTD severity may inform prognosis and predict illness severity, as well as occupational attainment, social functioning, well-being, and the quality of therapeutic relationships.  The heterogeneity of FTD has been described in a positive\u2013negative dichotomy with loose associations and increased speech production on one side and thought blocking and concretism on the opposite.  Nevertheless, factor analytic studies suggest up to 5 FTD factors, explaining more variance than positive\u2013negative dichotomy.  While the distinction between positive and negative FTD is well established,  self-reported and clinician\u2019s assessment are rarely distinguished. \n\nKircher et al.  introduced a novel rating scale, that is, the thought and language disorder scale (TALD), which distinguishes self-reported (subjective) and clinician reported (objective) as well as positive and negative FTD, resulting in 4 FTD dimensions: objective positive (OP), objective negative (ON), subjective positive (SP), subjective negative (SN). Factor analysis confirmed these 4 FTD dimensions. Two studies linked OP FTD to executive dysfunction, whereas ON FTD was linked to other cognitive impairment and poor functioning, while SN FTD was associated with poor quality of life.  These clinical associations with TALD subscales support the consideration of four distinct FTD dimensions, which are likely to arise from both shared and distinct neural mechanisms. However, little is known on the neural underpinnings of the 4 FTD dimensions. \n\nStructural brain imaging of FTD consistently indicates reduced gray matter volume (GMV) and lower cortical thickness (CorTh) in the language circuitry, including the bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior parietal lobe (IPL), the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and left middle temporal gyrus (MTG).  Furthermore, positive FTD was mainly linked to reduced GMV and lower CorTh in the core cortical language network including bilateral STG and MTG, as well as the left IFG and IPL.  In contrast, negative FTD was associated with reduced GMV or CorTh in frontal cortices and subcortical structures including thalamus and hippocampus.  Still, the available data is missing a consistent pattern of gray matter (GM) alterations. \n\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies reported white matter (WM) alterations in patients with FTD in major fronto-temporal and fronto-parietal association fibers.  The majority of studies indicated increased diffusion in language tracts in patients with severe positive FTD. \n\nFunctional neuroimaging studies on FTD during rest or during language tasks have yielded conflicting findings.  Perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies during the resting-state repeatedly indicated higher perfusion with more severe FTD in regions of the bilateral language network, specifically in the IFG, STG, MTG, and IPL.  Few functional MRI (fMRI) studies investigated positive or negative FTD specifically.  For instance, resting-state perfusion was increased in the STG with higher negative FTD ratings.  Task fMRI studies indicated lower activity in the left temporal cortex in subjects with increased positive FTD severity.  In contrast, increased negative FTD was linked to higher activity in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC), inferior frontal, and left temporal cortex during a 2-back task. \n\nTo develop specific treatments for FTD, we need to understand the underlying pathobiology. Studies testing 1 or 2 FTD dimensions broadly indicated an involvement of the language circuitry, but failed to explain specific phenomena while reporting inconsistent patterns of brain-behavior associations. Given the multidimensional structure of FTD, we may need to test four dimensions, including objective, subjective, negative, and positive FTD. As positive and negative FTD typically correlate with each other, any correlation between FTD ratings and a neuroimaging measure will emphasize common over distinct effects of FTD dimensions.  Therefore, we will explore the neural correlates of four TALD dimensions utilizing multimodal brain imaging including resting-state perfusion and GM structure in patients with schizophrenia. We hypothesize to replicate the general association of FTD severity with brain structural and perfusion alterations in the broad language network. In addition, we assume distinct patterns of brain-behavior correlations for OP, ON, SP, and SN FTD dimensions. To test specific contributions of each dimension, we will control for covariance with the other dimensions. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nFor the present study, we collected data from 129 patients, of which 110 entered the final analysis following quality checks (see  ). We combined data from two clinical trials targeting psychomotor slowing or gesture impairments in schizophrenia spectrum disorders: OCoPS-P (Overcoming Psychomotor Slowing in Psychosis, NCT03921450) and BrAGG-SoS (Brain stimulation And Group therapy to improve Gesture and Social Skills in psychosis, NCT04106427). Recruitment was done at the in- and out-patient departments of the University Hospital of Psychiatry, Bern. All participants provided written informed consent. The study protocols adhered to the declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the local ethics committee. To be included, participants had to be right-handed, age 18\u201365 years, and to suffer from schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, brief psychotic disorder, or schizophreniform disorders according to DSM-5. Exclusion criteria were substance abuse other than nicotine, history of neurologic disease, severe brain injury, transcranial magnetic stimulation in the past 3 months, pregnancy or nursing, and any metal objects in the body. Diagnoses and exclusion criteria were ascertained following clinical diagnostic interviews, physical examination, and review of case files by trained psychiatrists. One hundred four out of 110 patients currently received antipsychotic medication, while 24 (22%) also received additional psychotropic medication, mainly antidepressants (for details see  ). In total 91 had schizophrenia, 14 schizoaffective disorder, and 5 schizophreniform disorder ( ). Twenty-one patients had comorbid diagnoses, including catatonia (14), depression (4), obsessive-compulsive disorder (2), and posttraumatic stress disorder (1). \n\n\n### Procedures \n  \nWe assessed psychopathology using the TALD  and the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).  The TALD is a comprehensive 30-item clinical rating scale covering a wide array of FTD symptoms including both objectively observable, as well as subjective symptoms in the positive and negative dimensions.  Thus, the TALD is comprised of four subscales: OP, ON, SP, and SN. The relative score for each subscale was calculated and used in all subsequent analyses, that is, the sum of the subscale divided by the number of items of the subscale ( ,  ). All raters (LM, AK, DA, DB-G) were clinical psychiatrists, who received TALD training by the principal investigator to achieve optimal inter-rater reliability (\u03b1 > .80). Psychopathology assessments were performed within 48 h of MRI scanning. We calculated the mean olanzapine equivalents (OLZ eq.) according to Leucht et al. \n  \nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics \n    \n\n### MR Imaging \n  \nWe performed multimodal neuroimaging at the translational imaging center of the Swiss Institute for Translational and Entrepreneurial Medicine, Bern, Switzerland and acquired 3 neuroimaging markers: resting-state cerebral blood flow (rsCBF); CortTh, GMV. The MRI scans were acquired on a 3T Prisma MRI whole-body scanner using a 20-channel radio-frequency head coil (Siemens, Germany). Patients lay horizontally in the MR scanner and their arms rested beside their trunks. We placed head motion foam pads around the patients\u2019 heads and we explicitly instructed them to avoid head motion. In addition, in a subgroup of 71 patients, we successfully acquired diffusion-weighted images (DWI). Details regarding the MRI acquisition parameters are given in  . \n\n#### Perfusion and Voxel-Based Morphometry Preprocessing. \n  \nFirst, the MP2RAGE T1-3D images were segmented into GM, WM, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using the CAT12 toolbox ( ) in SPM12 (Version 7771, Welcome Trust, London, UK.  ). The segmented tissues were saved in both native and DARTEL space. \n\n##### Perfusion Imaging Preprocessing \n  \nThe pulsed arterial spin labeling preprocessing steps consisted of realignment and unwrapping to correct for motion and distortion due to field inhomogeneity. We then quantified rsCBF (ml/100 g/min) according to a previously applied, standardized protocol  (see  ). CBF Images were realigned and co-registered to the corresponding raw T1-3D image and normalized using the deformation matrix of the corresponding T1-3D image. A denoising step was performed using subject-wise first-level generalized linear models (GLMs) with the WM and CSF signal and the 6 motion parameters from realignment as explanatory variables.  We used the mean rsCBF map for further analysis. For quality control, we checked six motion parameters (  x  -,   y  -,   z  -translations, roll, pitch, and yaw) and set a limit of 2.5 mm of motion in any direction for exclusion. \n\n\n##### Voxel-Based Morphometry \n  \nThe preprocessing of the GM volume was performed using the DARTEL VBM algorithm with SPM 12, following the standard procedure established by Ashburner.  First, we created a DARTEL template by integrating the sampled patients\u2019 brains for spatial normalization. Then, the modulated native GM was normalized and smoothed using a 6 mm FHWM Gaussian kernel to the MNI template for position localization using SPM12. Total intracranial volume (TIV) was calculated for each patient by summing GM, WM, and CSF tissue volumes. \n\n\n\n#### CortTh and Diffusion-Weighted Imaging. \n  \nDetails for the structural imaging preprocessing are given in  . We used the standard FreeSurfer image analysis suite for cortical reconstruction  (7.1.1)( ) to conduct the preprocessing steps for CortTh analyses. The preprocessing for diffusion-weighted imaging was performed using FSL 6.04 ( .  For tractograghy, we computed the diffusion tensor parameters (Fractional anisotropy [FA] and mean diffusivity [MD]) for each of the 11 fiber bundles of interest (see  ), using the Quantitative Imaging Toolkit (QIT, ). Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) in FSL was used for the voxel-wise statistical analysis of FA and MD. \n\n\n\n### Statistical Analyses \n  \nIn all the imaging analyses we controlled for age, medication (OLZ), and TIV. Moreover, when exploring the associations of brain markers with each of the TALD sub-scores (OP, ON, SP, and SN), we entered the other three sub-scores as covariates. Internal consistency of the TALD was tested with Cronbach\u2019s alpha. While all tests were corrected for multiple comparisons, the most stringent correction would include adjusting for 16 tests (4 brain parameters and 4 TALD subscales), yielding a   P  -value of .0031. \n\n#### rsCBF Analysis. \n  \nFor rsCBF analyses, we calculated the association between brain perfusion and FTD severity, using a second-level multiple regression model for TALD total score and another for the TALD sub-scores. We set a cluster-forming threshold of   P   = .005 and a   P  -value corrected with false discovery rate (qFDR) corrected < .05 for the cluster-wise threshold. \n\n\n#### CortTh Analysis. \n  \nTo identify the association between CortTh and TALD total or TALD sub-scores, group comparisons were performed using the GLM and DODS (\u201cdifferent offset, different slope\u201d) method with no smoothing.  Left and right hemispheres were analyzed separately. The main results were corrected for multiple comparisons with the standard process, that is, a pre-cached cluster-wise Monte-Carlo simulation using a cluster-wise forming threshold of   P   < .05 and 10 000 random permutations.  Statistical models were also corrected for the 2 hemispheres, respectively, and the cluster-level   P  -value was set at .025  to correct for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, the CortTh value of the significant cluster provided by Freesurfer was exported to run a partial correlation (Kendall method) in R (version 4.0.2) using the ppcor package for the TALD sub-scores and added age, medication, TIV, and the other TALD sub-scores as covariates of non-interest. \n\n\n#### VBM Analysis. \n  \nFor VBM analysis, we used an absolute threshold of.1 to ensure the inclusion of GM voxels with a probability \u2265 .1 of being GM. To evaluate the association between local GMV and FTD severity, we used a second-level multiple regression model for TALD total score and a second one for the TALD sub-scores. We set a cluster-forming threshold of   P   = .005 and a   P  -value qFDR corrected < .05 for the cluster-wise threshold. \n\n\n#### DTI Analyses. \n  \nThese exploratory analyses were performed only in a subset of 71 patients. Using the preprocessed DWI, we performed tractography analyses as well as TBSS to explore the association between the measures of structural connectivity and FTD severity. For tractography analysis, Kendall tau correlation analyses were performed between the mean FA of each of the 11 fiber bundles and TALD total score, as well as the TALD sub-scores. We performed the same set of analyses on the MD values. A   P  -value < .05 FDR corrected was considered statistically significant for these exploratory analyses. Within TBSS, a regression analysis of whole-brain FA and MD with TALD total and subscales was performed. The level of significance was set at   P  -FWE corrected < .05, using a threshold-free cluster enhancement with 5000 randomized permutations. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and Clinical Characteristics \n  \nClinical and demographic characteristics of the 110 patients are presented in  . Symptom severity as measured by the PANSS was moderate to severe, as was FTD according to the TALD, but no gender differences or differences between diagnoses appeared (see  ). Using Kendall\u2019s tau we tested bivariate correlations between the 4 TALD subscales across subjects. The subjective subscales (SP and SN), the positive subscales (OP and SP), as well as the negative subscales (ON and SN) showed positive correlations ( ). Internal consistency of the TALD and its subscales was acceptable to good (TALD total \u03b1 = .77, SP \u03b1 = .56, SN \u03b1 = .70, OP \u03b1 = .83, ON \u03b1 = .67). \n\n\n### General FTD Severity\u2014TALD Total \n  \nThe multiple regression model exploring the association between TALD and whole-brain rsCBF indicated that higher FTD severity is associated with increased rsCBF in bilateral DLPFC (Broadman area [BA] 9), left frontal eye field (BA 8), and right cerebellum ( ,  ). Neither for CorTh nor for GMV did we observe associations with the TALD total score. \n  \nMRI Analysis Summary of Only Significant Clusters for the Associations of TALD Total Score, As well as, TALD Sub-scores (OP, ON, SP, SN) Severity for rsCBF, CorthTh, and GMV Analyses \n      \nAssociations of TALD total score, as well as TALD sub-scores (OP, ON, SP, SN) severity with rsCBF, CorthTh, and GMV analyses corrected for each other subscale, age, medication (OLZ eq), and TIV. Red/yellow denotes a positive association (corrected   P  -value < .05), while blue denotes a negative association (corrected   P  -value < .05). Specific statistics of significant clusters are given in  . Detailed associations of TALD sub-scores with GMV are presented in  . TALD, Thought and Language Disorder scale; OP, objective positive, ON, objective negative; SP, subjective positive, SN, subjective negative; rsCBF, resting-state cerebral blood flow; CortTh, cortical thickness; GMV, gray matter volume; OLZ eq, olanzapine equivalents.. \n  \n#### FTD Dimensions\u2014TALD Subscales \n  \n##### Objective Positive \n  \nThe multiple regression model exploring the association between OP sub-score and whole-brain rsCBF showed that higher OP scores were associated with increased rsCBF in bilateral cerebellum, bilateral thalamus, and bilateral limbic areas ( ,  ). Furthermore, we observed OP severity to be associated with higher GM volume in the bilateral cerebellum as well as in the right putamen and lingual gyrus ( ,  ,  ). However, OP sub-score and whole-brain CortTh were not associated. \n\n\n##### Objective Negative \n  \nThe model exploring the ON sub-score showed no association with whole-brain rsCBF. Likewise, we found no correlation with whole-brain CortTh. In contrast, ON severity was associated with higher GMV in the right middle frontal gyrus including the right supplementary motor area (SMA) ( ,  ,  ). \n\n\n##### Subjective Positive (SP) \n  \nExploring the association between SP and whole-brain CortTh, we observed that higher SP severity was linked to increased CortTh in the right IFG pars triangularis. Furthermore, SP severity was associated with higher GMV in the bilateral anterior prefrontal cortex, right orbital part of the IFG, as well as left orbito-frontal cortex. In addition, trend associations between SP severity and higher GMV were noted in right primary motor cortex, SMA, and right Broca\u2019s area ( ,  ,  ). However, we found no association with whole-brain rsCBF. \n\n\n##### Subjective Negative \n  \nSN severity was associated with lower GMV in the right anterior prefrontal cortex and right orbital part of the IFG as well as left premotor cortex and SMA, left inferior temporal gyrus, and left temporal pole ( ,  ,  ). However, no associations were detected between SN scores and CBF or CortTh. \n\n\n##### Unadjusted TALD Subscales \n  \nWhen we analyzed the associations of the TALD subscales without correcting for the other subscales, results remained very similar ( ). However, we found increased SN to be linked to increased rsCBF in left prefrontal and right premotor cortex, while its association with lower GMV disappeared. \n\n\n\n\n### Exploratory Analyses of DTI Data \n  \nIn the tractography analyses, only the TALD total score showed negative correlations ( ) with mean FA within left and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), left superior longitudinal fasciculus II, right uncinate fasciculus, and superior temporal cortex connections via the corpus callosum. As an example, 2 correlation plots are presented in  . No statistically significant association was observed for MD or any TALD sub-scores. \n  \nPartial Correlation of the Association Between Total TALD Severity and Mean FA and MD Values (Corrected for Age, Medication [OLZ eq] and TIV) for a Subset of Our Sample Size (  n   = 71) for 11 Bundles Following Diffusion Tensor Imaging Analyses \n      \n(A) Example correlation plots for 2 bundles (superior longitudinal fasciculus II and left inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus) showing the association between mean FA and total TALD score.

This sub-score severity also presented a trend for a positive association with mean FA in the frontal lobe (cluster: 94 voxels, TFCE qFWE   P   = .09) in the interhemispheric premotor pathway. All other associations were not statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn 110 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, we aimed at exploring the neural correlates of four distinct dimensions of FTD using perfusion and structural MRI. In line with our hypotheses, we found distinct associations for each of the 4 FTD dimensions controlling for the severity of the other FTD dimensions. Four main findings emerged: (1) OP FTD was associated with increased resting-state perfusion and GMV in subcortical areas, such as bilateral cerebellum, thalamus, and basal ganglia. (2) SP FTD was associated with increased GMV and CorTh in the right IFG, whereas (3) SN FTD was linked to reduced GMV in premotor cortex and IFG. And (4) ON in turn was associated with increased GMV in premotor cortices. \n\nLanguage is processed by a left-lateralized fronto-temporal association network, including Broca\u2019s and Wernicke\u2019s regions as well as the arcuate fascicle.  In addition, this language network is closely tied to other important brain networks, such as the default mode, salience, and central executive networks.  Components of the network are specialized, for example, superior and middle temporal lobe for semantic memory, IFG for integrating multiple information, and the cingulate and DLPFC for language control, for example, discourse planning. Brain alterations located in the core language network and adjunct cortical and subcortical brain areas are neural correlates of the clinical phenomenon of FTD.  In line with previous studies on FTD, the present study linked FTD severity to neural alterations in orbito-frontal and medialfrontal cortices, thalamus, and cerebellum.  Indeed, as in previous reports, both negative FTD dimensions (ON and SN) were associated with bilateral GM alterations in orbito-frontal and medialfrontal cortices.  Similarly, the current findings on resting-state perfusion broadly corroborate previous reports on altered perfusion and task-based activation in the cerebellum and medial temporal lobe in patients with FTD. \n\nBesides these commonalities, this study extends previous knowledge by applying multimodal brain imaging and a multidimensional FTD measure that also includes subjective FTD. Differences between our study and prior reports are likely to arise from three important factors: sample characteristics, FTD measure used, and neuroimaging analyses applied. Indeed, sample size and heterogeneous clinical characteristics heavily impact associations between brain and behaviors. Our patients had a broad distribution of FTD severity, general symptom severity, and chronicity. While previous reports applied the Thought, Language, and Communication scale, our study used the TALD covering FTD much broader allowing to explore 4 distinct FTD dimensions, including 2 on the subjective experience of FTD.  Finally, we chose to explore the contribution of each dimension separately, correcting for the variance of the other three dimensions. While this approach enables to test associations specific to single FTD dimensions, it is also prone to eliminate the effect of common pathways to FTD as their scores jointly correlate. The FTD dimensions are not mutually exclusive in the single subject, instead, some participants score on more than one FTD dimension. Thus, with correction for the other dimensions, shared neural alterations among the subscales are excluded in these results. However, when we explored the associations without correcting for the other subscales, results generally included clusters of similar size and location, suggesting small contributions of the shared variance among FTD dimensions. Only in the SN dimension did results change with the novel appearance of rsCBF clusters and GMV clusters vanishing, which might be due to strong correlations of SN with SP and ON. Collectively, the current results should be appreciated as complementary to previous findings. \n\nResting-state CBF is a marker of local metabolic activity. Previous studies reported more severe FTD to be associated with higher rsCBF in the core language network, i.e., bilateral STG, angular gyrus, or left IFG.  Our study found higher TALD total scores (severer FTD) to be linked to increased rsCBF in adjunct regions of the language network, for example in bilateral DLPFC and right cerebellum. The DLPFC has been proposed to critically contribute to language processing, for example when processing syntax, prosody, coherence.  Likewise, the cerebellum is involved in word generation, verbal working memory, and articulatory movements.  Thus, increased neural activity in bilateral DLPFC might reflect specific pathology causing defective language control, such as peculiar articulation or loose associations. Likewise, OP severity was linked to increased rsCBF in thalamus, fusiform gyrus, and cerebellum. Indeed, increased neural activity during increased speech production, tangentiality, or neologisms seems plausible. For example, patients with positive FTD had increased neural activity in cerebellum, fusiform gyrus, and caudate in fMRI-tasks of free speech. \n\nIn general, FTD severity has previously been linked to reduced GMV and lower CorTh in the language circuitry, including the bilateral STG, IPL, IFG, and left MTG.  In line with our hypotheses, we found 3 FTD dimensions (OP, ON, SP) to be associated with increased GMV, while 1 (SN) was linked to reduced GMV. \n\nThe OP subscale summarizes observable signs of increased thought and language production, for example, logorrhea, pressured speech, and neologisms.  OP severity was associated with increased GMV in right putamen and bilateral cerebellum, where we noted spatial overlap with findings of increased rsCBF. The association of GMV and OP severity was detected in bilateral lobule VI, an area active during verb generation, motor verbal utterance, and verbal working memory.  Collectively, observable positive FTD seems to be associated with speech motor regions. \n\nThe SP subscale includes the subjective experiences of pressure of thought and thought interference.  Increased SP scores were specifically associated with altered GM in the executive network, which is thought to control language output and often found less efficient in subjects with conceptual disorganization. \n\nThe ON subscale represents qualitative and quantitative reductions of language and thought with items such as concretism and poverty of speech.  Higher ON scores were associated with increased GMV premotor areas. A similar effect had previously been reported for reduced motor behavior in schizophrenia, which was associated with increased GMV and increased rsCBF in the SMA. \n\nThe SN subscale includes items such as poverty of thought, rumination, or blocking.  SN was the only subscale linked to decreased GMV in multiple fronto-temporal areas including the SMA. The anterior prefrontal cortex is critical in planning and allocating resources of attention.  Disturbance of these functions could give rise to typical features of SN, such as inhibited thinking, or impaired speech reception. SN was also associated with decreased GMV in the left temporal pole, which serves important semantic functions such as naming, word-object labeling, and semantic processing in all modalities. \n\nOur exploratory diffusion tensor imaging tractography analysis detected higher total TALD scores to be associated with reduced FA, indicating more diffusion and less organized WM microstructure, in the ventral language stream (left and right IFOF, right uncinate fasciculus). These results are in line with most reports linking FTD to FA in major fronto-temporal and fronto-parietal association fibers. \n\nWhile some cognitive domains and clinical courses have been linked to sex differences, this study did not find sex differences in the clinical presentation of FTD.  Also, the reported neuroimaging correlates were unchanged when adding sex as covariate to the models (data not shown). \n\nThis study has several limitations. First, we exclusively focused on FTD in the context of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Thus, our results may not translate to FTD in other conditions. Second, the analyses combined data from two RCTs introducing potential selection bias, as patients consented to complicated procedures. Nevertheless, subjects had substantial illness severity and duration. Third, 104 out of 110 patients received antipsychotic medication at the time of the study. As antipsychotics may affect both brain structure and FTD severity, we covaried for current dosage in all analyses. In addition, we corrected imaging analyses for TIV and age. Still, in the small group of patients with other medication, further effects on brain structure are possible. Fourth, DTI was available only in a subset of our sample (  n   = 71), limiting the statistical power for these analyses. Fifth, comparisons across imaging modalities are hampered by the application of different techniques to control for multiple comparisons, however, we chose the standard corrections for each neuroimaging method. Sixth, the cross-sectional design of the study does not allow inferences on whether rsCBF increases may compensate for altered GMV.  Finally, the TALD subscales include heterogeneous numbers of items (OP > SN > ON > SP) due to the origin of factor analysis. We calculated a relative score for each subscale, but the variance explained by the total TALD differs between subscales, rendering some subscales more robust than others. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis study found distinct neural correlates across multiple MRI measures for four FTD dimensions in psychosis, extending prior work on positive and negative FTD. Cerebellar structure and perfusion are implicated in OP FTD, IFG in SP FTD, and premotor cortex volumes in objective and SN FTD. Findings suggest that specific FTD dimensions may be targeted by non-invasive brain stimulation, calling for more refined investigations on FTD networks, as well as longitudinal and transdiagnostic studies. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \nSupplementary material is available at  . \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10031743, "text_md5": "2ff63ef3ef82a6222caf5d2d805b5d13", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 320], "journal": [321, 335], "publication_year": [337, 341], "title": [352, 420], "keywords": [434, 473], "abstract": [486, 2366], "body": [2375, 32580]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 36946525, "doi": "10.1093/schbul/sbac120", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10031743", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10031743"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10031743\">10031743</a>", "list_title": "PMC10031743  Neural Correlates of Formal Thought Disorder Dimensions in Psychosis"}

Detailed memory retrieval is thought to involve the reinstatement of those representations. Functional MRI combined with representational similarity analyses (RSA) of spatial patterns of brain activity has revealed reinstatement of recently-experienced events throughout a core memory retrieval network. In the present study, participants were scanned while they watched, immediately retrieved and then retrieved after a week, 24 short videos. Following the delayed retrieval, they freely recalled all videos outside of the scanner. We observed widespread within- and between-subject reinstatement effects within a posterior midline core memory retrieval network during all phases of the experiment. Within precuneus, bilateral middle temporal gyrus and the left hippocampus, reinstatement effects between the retrieval phases correlated with memory performance. These findings extend previous studies that have only employed short retention periods or highly rehearsed materials, demonstrating that memory representations for unique events are reliably reinstated over longer timeframes that are meaningful in the context of real-world episodic memory. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEpisodic memory is the recollection of lifelike events . Very recent events can often be recollected in great detail, but specific details may be quickly forgotten, leaving only a vague and gist-like memory . Nevertheless, some memories are retained in detail for weeks and even years . When we retrieve an episodic memory, it is thought that we reinstate neural representations that were present when the event was encoded . In addition to enabling detailed and vivid recall of the event, this active retrieval may promote consolidation of the event . Although reinstatement effects for complex lifelike stimuli such as video clips have been observed over short retention periods  or over long delays using highly practiced stimuli , reinstatement of individual episodic memories has not been demonstrated over the timeframes in which episodic memory operates in everyday life. In this study we investigate memory reinstatement for detailed lifelike memories between encoding, immediate retrieval and one-week delayed retrieval. \n\nMost neuroscientific models of systems memory consolidation argue that memory traces are stabilized by neuronal reactivation of memory traces, whereby the reinstatement of patterns of neural firing elicited during encoding strengthens links between the hippocampus and distinct cortical areas or between cortical regions themselves . Although this is often viewed as a passive process, some have argued that active retrieval may promote faster consolidation of memories . Several functional MRI studies have found evidence for this reactivation by showing that spatial patterns of fMRI BOLD activity are similar when people encode and retrieve the same memories. This is the case for simple stimuli such as picture-picture or word-picture pairings  as well as more complex stimuli such as short videos  or events from a continuous film . Reinstatement effects between encoding and retrieving episodic memories  are usually seen within a \u201ccore retrieval network\u201d including the hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus, the angular gyrus (AG) and posterior midline cortex (PMC) including precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC ), a group of regions which has also been characterized as the Posterior Medial system (PM System ; see also  for a similar chracterization). Bird   et al  . demonstrated that the degree of reinstatement in the PCC is related to subsequent memory performance, suggesting a particularly important role for this structure in successful memory retrieval. \n\nBeyond these within-subject findings, a recent study also reported inter-subject correlations in the core retrieval network across subjects watching and retrieving aloud a 50-minute film , suggesting the existence of \u201cshared\u201d representations of the contents of specific scenes. Within PMC and other parts of the core retrieval network, these inter-subject pattern correlations were higher during retrieval than between encoding and retrieval, suggesting that memories had been altered in a systematic way across participants to representations that were more generic and schematic in nature. \n\nReinstatement effects have typically been investigated across retention intervals of less than a day. Investigating episodic memories over longer retention intervals presents a challenge as they are typically forgotten relatively quickly , and even lifelike stimuli such as videos are remembered relatively poorly after a week if they are not rehearsed . To circumvent this issue, Buchsbaum and colleagues  scanned a group of participants who were highly practiced at mentally replaying a large number of 5-second videos and showed that patterns of BOLD activity during mental replay resemble those present during encoding (see also ). Using longer videos, Bird   et al  .  showed that a single retrieval phase soon after encoding resulted in memories that could be recalled in detail one or two weeks later. Very similar findings were reported by Sekeres   et al  . . This benefit of an immediate retrieval phase on subsequent recall performance has been reported for a wide variety of memory stimuli and is referred to as the \u201ctesting effect\u201d or \u201cretrieval practice effect\u201d . The design of our study allows us to investigate this phenomenon in greater depth, as participants were scanned during memory encoding, immediate retrieval (retrieval practice) and delayed retrieval after a week. Our study had several aims. The first was to replicate previous studies demonstrating reinstatement between encoding and immediate retrieval. The second was to investigate reinstatement between encoding and delayed retrieval, extending the findings of Buchsbaum and colleagues . The final and most important aim was to investigate reinstatement between immediate and delayed retrieval and to compare this to reinstatement effects between encoding and retrieval. \n\nIn general, we predict that retrieval of lifelike events involves the reinstatement of spatial patterns of BOLD activity that were present during encoding, irrespective of the retention delay. However, it is possible that reinstatement between the retrieval phases will be greater than between encoding and retrieval. Retrieval practice is argued to result in the establishment of elaborated or transformed memory traces rather than simply strengthening or stabilizing the original traces . In this case (a) there should be additional regions that exhibit reinstatement between retrieval phases compared with encoding and retrieval phases, or (b) there should be significantly greater reinstatement between retrieval phases in at least a subset of the regions where there is reinstatement between encoding and retrieval phases. \n\nFollowing previous studies, we use representational similarity analyses (RSA ) to investigate reinstatement effects when encoding and retrieving matching videos as well as to identify regions where reinstatement correlates with memory performance a week after encoding. Whole brain \u201csearchlight\u201d analyses are reported which show the entire distribution of the effects, as well as effects within a PMC region of interest (ROI) given this area\u2019s consistent implication in memory reinstatement effects. Our main focus will be on reinstatement effects between the two retreival phases, including where reinstatement correlates with subsequent memory performance. Additionally, we report findings from inter-subject pattern correlation analyses that replicate and extend the recent findings of Chen and colleagues . \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-five adults participated in the study but four were excluded from further analyses: one due to excessive head motion, one due to failure to remember the videos and two due to technical problems leading to incomplete data sets. We report results from 21 young adults (aged 18\u201335, mean age 25.6\u2009SD 5.1 years, 11 female). All were healthy adults, right-handed and had normal or corrected to normal vision. They gave written informed consent and were paid for participation. The study was approved by the Brighton and Sussex Medical School Research and Governance Ethics Committee and was conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. \n\n\n### Experimental design \n  \nParticipants watched 24 short videos while in the MRI scanner. The videos lasted on average 38\u2009seconds (range 29\u201348\u2009s) and were taken from short films or videos posted on  . All videos depicted a short narrative and were presented without sound. The stories centered around one character (5 videos), two main characters (8 videos) or an interaction of multiple characters (11 videos). 13 videos took place outside, 8 videos took place inside of a building and three videos switched between these types of locations. The order of the videos was pseudorandomized across participants. All stimuli were pre-experimentally unfamiliar to the participants. \n\nAll participants were scanned twice, with one week between scans. Participants were scanned at a similar time of day on both days. The task was programmed in the Cogent 2000 toolbox ( ) using MATLAB (Version 2013b, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). For a visualization of the study design, see Fig.\u00a0 .   \nStudy design. On Day 1 there were two scanning runs. In each run, participants consecutively watched all 12 videos (encoding phase, Enc), and then were cued to silently retrieve each video (immediate retrieval phase, ImRet) and then rate the vividness of their memory. Cues were the titles of the video and a screenshot showing the first frame. One week later (Day 8), participants silently retrieved all 24 videos (delayed retrieval phase, DelRet) and rated the vividness of each memory in a single scanning run. After scanning, they described all 24 videos to the experimenter. \n  \n\n Day 1  : Before scanning, all participants performed a practice trial with an example video outside of the MRI scanner. In the scanner participants watched (encoding phase: Enc) and retrieved (immediate retrieval phase: ImRet) 24 short videos, split into two scanning runs. In each run participants watched all 12 videos first, and then completed the retrieval phase. We chose to split this phase into two separate scanning runs in order to give the participants a break from the scanner noise, as the experimental portion of the scanning on Day 1 lasted around 45\u2009minutes on average (durations differed across subjects due to the self-paced nature of the retrieval task). \n\nDuring the Enc phase, each video was presented on a black background and had a title displayed above throughout the presentation which was broadly related to the content of the video (e.g. \u201cNasty neighbours\u201d). Between each video, a white fixation cross was shown on a black background for 12\u2009s. \n\nBefore the ImRet phase, participants saw a 2-second cue consisting of the video\u2019s title and a static image of the first frame of the video; the screenshot then disappeared and the title then faded to grey and but was displayed for the duration of the trial on a black screen. The ImRet phase started as soon as the cue faded. It was self-paced within a duration window of more than 20\u2009s and less than 55\u2009s per trial. Participants indicated when they had finished silently retrieving the video by pressing a button with their right index finger. They were then asked to rate the vividness of their memory on a sliding scale of 1 to 6. After the ISI of 12\u2009s, retrieval of the next video began. \n\nAfter the scan, participants were requested not to rehearse the videos during the following week until their next scan. \n\n Day 8  : In a single scanning run, participants again silently retrieved all 24 videos (delayed retrieval phase: DelRet). The DelRet phase was structured identically to Day 1, including a cue and a vividness rating for each memory. \n\nAfter the scan, participants were asked to describe each video in as much detail as possible to the experimenter. They were cued with the title of the video. If they could not remember the video by the title alone, they were given up to three standardized hints per video. All video descriptions were audiotaped. \n\n\n### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nMemory performance during the final free recall phase outside of the scanner was assessed using the same procedure as Bird   et al  . . This provides a single score corresponding to the amount of detail recalled about each clip and is an objective performance measure that can be used in parametric analyses of the imaging data. Each video\u2019s description was scored for the amount of independent details they contained. For each detail recalled, participants were given a score of 0, 0.5 or 1. The score would be 0 if a detail was not mentioned, it would be 0.5 if a detail was partially correct (e.g. \u201csomeone\u201d, \u201cpicks up something\u201d) and 1 if the detail was fully correct (e.g. \u201ca man\u201d, \u201cpicks up bricks\u201d). There was no maximum amount of details to be recalled per video. This procedure is based on the scoring of widely used prose recall tests (e.g. Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test; ). To ensure consistency across participants, all video descriptions were rated by one of the authors (C.O.). \n\nIn the parametric analyses of the imaging data (see Within-subject RSA below) we wished to account for the fact that some videos were more memorable than others. For example, a score of 10 might be above the mean for one particular video but below the mean for another. Therefore, the mean number of details recalled across all participants for a video was subtracted from the participant\u2019s score for that video, in order to index the relative memory performance on each video. \n\nAll behavioral data were analyzed in SPSS 22 (IBM). We compared retrieval duration and vividness ratings across scanning runs on Day 1 and Day 8 with paired   t   tests. \n\n\n### MRI scanning \n  \nAll images were acquired on a Siemens 1.5\u2009T Avanto MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a 32-channel head coil. For the acquisition of fMRI data we acquired T2*-weighted gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences (TR\u2009=\u20092.62\u2009s, TE\u2009=\u200942 ms, FA\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, FoV\u2009=\u2009256 mm). We acquired 35 oblique 3-mm-thick slices in ascending order; voxel size 3.0\u2009\u00d7\u20093.0\u2009\u00d7\u20093.0 mm, with 0.6 mm inter-slice gap, aligned parallel to the AC\u2013PC plane. The Enc and ImRet phases were scanned in two runs on Day 1 and the DelRet phase was scanned in one run on Day 8. Anatomical images were acquired on Day 8 using a 3D T1-weighted MP-RAGE sequence (TR\u2009=\u20092.73\u2009s, TE\u2009=\u20093.57 ms, FoV\u2009=\u2009256 mm, voxel size 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0 mm). \n\n\n### Functional MRI data analysis \n  \nWe conducted several RSA searchlight analyses  to investigate similarities in spatial patterns of BOLD signal associated with memories for lifelike events over time. All images were analyzed using SPM8 ( ) and the CoSMoMVPA toolbox  in MATLAB (Version 2013b, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). To describe our findings we used MNI coordinates and the Anatomy toolbox for SPM8 . Statistical images were cluster corrected for FWE at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, using a height-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001. Thresholds were determined for whole-brain comparisons as well as for a ROI encompassing the hippocampus and the parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally (HC/PHC ROI, defined in the WFU PickAtlas, Functional MRI Laboratory, Wake Forest University School of Medicine) which was selected based on the findings of Bird   et al  .  and the known importance of this region in episodic memory. \n\nIn addition, we performed RSAs on the data from all voxels contained within two independently defined posterior midline ROIs. The PMC ROI (center of mass: 1, \u221253, 28), encompassing precuneus and PCC, was created from a posterior-medial cluster in the dorsal default mode network and was taken from a study of resting state connectivity  and was used in the study by Chen   et al  . . The mask was transferred into native space and we extracted average Fisher-transformed same\u2013video and different\u2013video correlations from this PMC ROI for each participant. In addition we used the PMC ROI to look at the\u00a0association of reinstatement with memory performance. To attempt to replicate the finding of Bird   et al  . , who found that the degree of reinstatement correlated with memory performance in a region of the PCC, a second ROI encompassing this region (center of mass: \u22125, \u221243, 33) was used for an RSA analysis between Enc and ImRet weighted by memory performance. \n\n#### Preprocessing \n  \nThe first five volumes of each run were discarded to allow for T1 equilibrium. Functional EPIs were realigned, slice-time corrected to the middle slice and co-registered to the participant\u2019s own anatomical image. These images were used for the RSA analysis. \n\n\n#### Multivariate analysis \n  \nAt the first level all runs were modeled separately and analyses were carried out in native space. On Day 1, there were 36 regressors of interest in each of the two runs corresponding to the 12 Enc trials, the 12 ImRet trials and the 12 screenshot cues at the start of each retrieval. The Enc and ImRet regressors varied in duration according to the length of the video or the self-paced retrieval phase, whereas the cue regressor was modelled with a 2\u2009s duration. To account for nuisance fluctuations in the EPI data, all first-level models included a regressor coding for global white matter drift in the MR signal (computed as mean white matter intensity after voxel-wise z-scoring). This was done rather than high-pass temporal filtering to maximize the detection power of BOLD effects that spanned across the encoding and retrieval phases of Day 1. In total, eight regressors of no interest were included in the model (one for rating (vividness), 6 for motion and one for global white matter drift). On Day 8 there were 48 regressors of interest, one for each of the 24 DelRet trials and one for each screenshot cue at the start of each retrieval phase. The DelRet regressors varied in duration and the cue was modelled with a 2\u2009s duration. The same regressors of no interest were included in the model. \n\n\n#### Within-subject RSAs \n  \nIn a series of RSAs, we investigated similarities in spatial patterns of BOLD signal between encoding and retrieval phases (Enc/ImRet, Enc/DelRet), as well as between\u00a0the two retrieval phases (ImRet/DelRet). \n\nIn the first type of RSA, we took the correlations between activity patterns associated with the same videos and contrasted these with the correlations between different videos, i.e. a same-vs-different RSA comparison (Fig.\u00a0 ). This can be thought of as a basic reinstatement effect and might reflect general aspects of the video such as its location and the overarching theme. The second type of RSA considered only the correlations between patterns of activity for the same videos. These correlations are weighted positively and negatively by the factor of interest (memory performance or within-scanner ratings of vividness of retrieval) such that the diagonal sums to zero (Fig.\u00a0 ). This contrast identifies areas where the degree of reinstatement correlates with the richness of the retrieval.   \nSummary of main analyses. Panel (A) Within-subject RSAs were carried out between the three phases of the experiment. Panel (B) Same- versus-different RSA. Matrix comparing pattern similarity between same- versus-different videos. Same-video correlations are shown on-diagonal (red), different\u2013video correlations are shown off-diagonal (blue), and the weights sum to zero. Run effects within Day 1 were accounted for by not including between-run comparisons (black). Panel (C) Weighted RSA (example for a single participant). Here, only the same\u2013video correlations along the diagonal are considered. Correlations are weighted positively and negatively by a factor of interest (e.g. memory performance) such that the value along the diagonal sums to zero. This contrast is orthogonal to the same- versus-different RSA, as it only detects regions where reinstatement is greater for videos that are weighted positively; if all videos were reinstated equally, the resulting contrast would sum to zero. Three inter-subject RSAs were also performed, corresponding to the analyses shown in Panel A. Here, matching videos from the Enc, ImRet and DelRet phases were compared between subjects rather than within subject. \n  \n\nInputs to all searchlight analyses were   t  -statistic maps of each encoding or retrieval trial. For each type of RSA, a contrast matrix was specified that reflected the predicted differences in correlation across pairs of trials (Fig.\u00a0 ). A spherical searchlight was centered at each voxel in turn and comprised all surrounding voxels within a radius of 3 voxels (=about 110 voxels on average). This searchlight returned the summed difference in Fisher-transformed correlations for each pairwise comparison of interest, and this value was assigned to the center voxel of the searchlight. The resulting images of each analysis were then normalized to MNI space (voxel size 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092) and analyzed at group level in SPM8 with one-sample   t   tests against a null hypothesis of zero. \n\nA series of within-subject RSAs are reported where we investigated the correlations in patterns of BOLD activity between Enc/ImRet, Enc/DelRet and ImRet/DelRet, both across the whole-brain and within the pre-specified ROIs. For all comparisons, we report the same-vs-different video RSA effects as well as the RSAs weighted by memory performance. We additionally\u00a0report a further RSA of the retreival phases\u00a0weighted by in-scanner vividness ratings. Lastly, to rule out the possibility that RSA effects during the retrieval phases were driven by processing of the cues, we report a control same-vs-different RSA, where the first 12\u2009seconds of the retrieval trials are removed from the analysis. \n\n\n#### Comparison of within-subject RSAs between the phases \n  \nTo determine whether the reinstatement for ImRet/DelRet differs significantly from the reinstatement for Enc/ImRet (or Enc/DelRet), we directly compared the whole-brain maps from each RSA using paired samples   t   tests. We also compared same\u2013video and different\u2013video correlations from all voxels within the PMC ROI across the different phases. For the weighted analysis, we compared whole brain maps of the RSAs weighted by memory performance. \n\n\n#### Inter-subject RSAs \n  \nTo investigate whether there was evidence for shared neural representations of the events that are stable across time, we report inter-subject RSAs for Enc/ImRet, Enc/DelRet and ImRet/DelRet similar to those described by Chen and colleagues . Following the methods of their study, we first smoothed the data using a 6mm FWHM Gaussian kernel, then normalized the data to the MNI template. Each participant\u2019s data was then correlated using searchlight analysis with the average map of all other participants. For instance, to calculate the map for the correlation of Enc and DelRet, each participant\u2019s smoothed map of the Enc phase for each video was correlated with the average of all other participants\u2019 data for that video from the DelRet phase. All other methods were the same as described for the within-subjects RSAs above. \n\n\n#### Comparisons of inter-subject RSAs \n  \nTo investigate evidence for a systematic change in memory representations during the retrieval phases across subjects, we directly compared maps for the inter-subject RSAs between ImRet/DelRet and either Enc/ImRet or Enc/DelRet. \n\n\n\n### Data availability statement \n  \nThe datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. Unthresholded maps for all the reported analyses are available at  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nWe compared retrieval duration and vividness ratings for ImRet and DelRet. Retrieval duration did not change across runs, with a mean duration of 35.1\u2009s (SD\u2009\u00b1\u20098.0) during ImRet and a mean duration of 33.6\u2009s (SD\u2009\u00b1\u20098.8) during DelRet (  t  \u2009=\u20091.35,   p  \u2009=\u20090.193). Across the group of participants there was a 16% decrease in ratings of vividness over one week. Between ImRet and DelRet, vividness ratings dropped significantly from 4.2 (SD\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4) to 3.5 (SD\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6) (  t  \u2009=\u20097.7,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). Based on previous studies, we expected participants to give a detailed report of videos when they recalled them a week later and indeed memory performance for each video was goo, with\u00a0an average of 11.5 (SD\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7) details recalled from each video. A visualization of memory performance for each participant for each video can be found in Supplementary Figure\u00a0 . \n\nIn a follow-up analysis we investigated the relationship between vividness ratings from the ImRet and DelRet trials and memory performance. At an individual level, there was a significant (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05) correlation between vividness ratings during ImRet and memory performance in 11 of the 21 participants. For the vividness ratings during DelRet and memory performance there was a significant correlation in 17 of the 21 participants. To analyze the relationship between vividness and memory performance across the whole group, we Fisher-transformed the Pearson correlation coefficients for each individual and tested this against 0, using a one-sample   t   test. This was significant for ImRet (  t  \u2009=\u20099.48,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001) and DelRet (  t  \u2009=\u200910.31,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), indicating that there was a robust relationship between vividness and memory performance at the group level. \n\n\n### Functional MRI results \n  \n#### Reinstatement between encoding and immediate retrieval (Enc/ImRet) \n  \nThe same- vs-different RSA between Enc and ImRet identified the precuneus bilaterally as showing a significant reinstatement effect (Supp. Figure\u00a0  and Supp. Table\u00a0 ). This replicates the finding of Bird   et al  .  who showed the largest reinstatement effect between encoding and immediate retrieval in the same region. Within the independently defined PMC ROI, there was also a significant reinstatement effect (same: 0.129 (SEM\u2009\u00b1\u20090.018), different: 0.104 (SEM\u2009\u00b1\u20090.014), (  t  \u2009=\u20093.53,   p  \u2009=\u20090.002), see Fig.\u00a0  below).   \nBrain regions showing reinstatement for encoding and delayed retrieval. \n  \nCoordinates are in MNI space. Clusters are significant at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (FWE cluster corrected; cluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). \n    \nReinstatement effects for all phases in the PMC ROI. The differences between same\u2013 versus different\u2013video correlations are shown for the encoding and immediate and delayed retrieval phases within the PMC ROI (white). Significant effects were present in all three comparisons (the differences were greater than 0) but there were no significant differences between the effects across the three comparisons. Errors bars represent \u00b11   SEM   corrected for the within subject error term. \n  \n\nIn an RSA weighted by memory performance, we identified a region in the midline of the cerebellum (Supp. Table\u00a0 ). In the previous study by Bird   et al  . , this analysis identified a region within the PCC. We replicated this finding: an ROI analysis within the same PCC region (277 voxels, center of mass x\u2009=\u2009\u22123, y\u2009=\u2009\u221242, z\u2009=\u2009\u2009+\u200935) revealed a significant association between the strength of the Enc/ImRet correlation and memory performance (t \u2009=\u20092.36,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05). \n\nOverall, our results for Enc/ImRet largely replicate our previous findings, showing reinstatement effects in PMC regions, both in terms of general reinstatement between encoding and retrieval as well as the degree of reinstatement correlating with subsequent memory performance within the PCC. \n\n\n#### Reinstatement between encoding and delayed retrieval (Enc/DelRet) \n  \nThe same- vs-different RSA for Enc/DelRet revealed a network of regions centering on precuneus and lateral temporoparietal regions (Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ). The distribution of the reinstatement effects shown in Fig.\u00a0  is highly similar to the reinstatement effects between encoding and immediate retrieval reported by Bird   et al  .  and, at a lower threshold, to the Enc/ImRet RSA in the present study (see Supp. Figure\u00a0 ). There was again a significant reinstatement effect within the PMC ROI (same: 0.131 (SEM\u2009\u00b1\u20090.019), different: 0.100 (SEM\u2009\u00b1\u20090.017), (  t  \u2009=\u20095.06,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), see Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nBrain regions showing reinstatement between encoding and delayed retrieval. Clusters are significant at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (FWE cluster corrected; cluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001. \n  \n\nIn a whole brain analysis two regions showed an association between the strength of the correlations between Enc/DelRet and memory performance, one in right middle cingulate cortex and one in right inferior frontal gyrus (Table\u00a0 ). \n\nOverall, these results demonstrate that even when event memories are retrieved after a week, retrieval reinstates the same patterns of activity within regions of the core retrieval network that were present during encoding. \n\n\n#### Reinstatement between immediate and delayed retrieval (ImRet/DelRet) \n  \nWe identified several regions where the similarities in spatial patterns of BOLD signal for ImRet/DelRet was higher for the same- versus-different videos. This reinstatement effect was found in the bilateral precuneus, left AG, bilateral MTG/occipital gyrus, bilateral fusiform gyrus and right parahippocampal gyrus (Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ). The distribution of these reinstatement effects is very similar to those seen in the Enc/DelRet RSA (compare Fig.\u00a0  with Fig.\u00a0 ). There was once again a significant reinstatement effect within the PMC ROI (same: 0.136 (SEM\u2009\u00b1\u20090.015), different: 0.103 (SEM\u2009\u00b1\u20090.012), (  t  \u2009=\u20095.64,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), see Fig.\u00a0  below).   \nBrain regions showing reinstatement between immediate and delayed retrieval. Clusters are significant at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (FWE cluster corrected; cluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). \n    \nBrain regions showing reinstatement for immediate and delayed retrieval. \n  \nCoordinates are in MNI space. Clusters are significant at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (FWE cluster corrected; cluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001).  Within the HC/PHC ROI cluster is significant at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (FWE cluster corrected; cluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). \n  \n\nA number of regions showed significant effects of reinstatement for ImRet/DelRet weighted by memory performance. Most prominent were the bilateral precuneus and bilateral MTG (Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ). Smaller regions were also identified in the right temporal pole and left precentral gyrus. Additionally, within the HC/PHC ROI there was an effect in the left posterior hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05 FWE cluster corrected).   \nBrain regions showing reinstatement effects between immediate and delayed retrieval that correlate with memory performance. Clusters are significant at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (FWE cluster corrected across the whole brain or within a HC/PHC ROI; cluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). \n  \n\nA rather similar pattern of results were found when the ImRet/DelRet similarities were weighted by vividness ratings, including precuneus, bilateral MTG and right inferior temporal gyrus (see Supp. Figure\u00a0  for a comparison). Within the PMC ROI, we found an association with ImRet/DelRet and vividness (t \u2009=\u20094.61,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). It is unsurprising that the RSAs weighted by memory performance and vividness ratings should look similar, since both measures likely reflect the retrieval of episodic memories rich in sensory details. \n\nIt is possible that the reinstatement effects that we observed might be partly due to the presentation of a screenshot cue immediately prior to retrieval. To rule out this possibility we carried out a control same-vs-different RSA for ImRet/DelRet where we did not include the first 12\u2009seconds of each retrieval trial. This analysis once again identified reinstatement effects in PMC, right parahippocampal gyrus/fusiform gyrus, right MTG, left inferior temporal gyrus and right AG (see Supp. Figure\u00a0 ) indicating that the results were not driven by the cue. \n\nIn summary, reinstatement effects between the two retrieval phases are observed throughout the retrieval network and the pattern of effects is strikingly similar to those seen for Enc/DelRet. In several regions, reinstatement correlated with both memory performance and in-scanner ratings of vividness of retrieval, suggesting a key role of these regions in the processing of rich, sensory details. Reinstatement effects are highly unlikely to be driven by processing of the retrieval cues, since the effects are still present even if the first 12\u2009seconds of the retrieval events are not analyzed. \n\n\n#### Comparison of the patterns of reinstatement across phases \n  \nTo evaluate whether reinstatement for ImRet/DelRet engaged additional regions or showed greater reinstatement compared with Enc/ImRet or Enc/DelRet, we conducted two direct comparisons between the same-vs-different RSAs. At the whole-brain level, there were no significant differences in reinstatement (see Supp. Figures\u00a0  and  ). Within the PMC ROI, the difference between same-video and different-video correlations was similar between ImRet/DelRet and between Enc/ImRet as well as EnDelRet (Fig.\u00a0 ). Importantly, there was no evidence for an interaction between correlation type (same-video and different-video) and phase (Enc/ImRet, Enc/DelRet, ImRet/DelRet) within the PMC ROI (  F  \u2009=\u20090.53,   p  \u2009=\u20090.59). \n\nLastly, we performed whole-brain comparisons between all of the RSAs weighted by memory performance to search for regions where the association between reinstatement and subsequent memory was stronger between the ImRet/DelRet phases versus Enc/ImRet or Enc/DelRet. No regions showed this effect. Although not predicted   a priori  , the middle cingulate cortex showed a stronger effect for Enc/DelRet in contrast to ImRet/DelRet. \n\nThe purpose of these comparisons was to directly contrast the reinstatement effects for ImRet/DelRet with reinstatement between encoding and the retrieval phases (Enc/ImRet, Enc/DelRet). Identifying any region where reinstatement effects were stronger between retrieval phases compared with encoding would have been evidence for elaborated or transformed memory traces created during the immediate retrieval (retrieval practice) phase. However, we found no evidence for reinstatement between retrieval phases (ImRet/DelRet) that is over and above that seen between encoding and retrieval (Enc/ImRet, Enc/DelRet), either in terms of simple reinstatement effects (same-vs different RSA) or when reinstatement was weighted by memory performance. \n\n\n#### Inter-subject RSAs \n  \nInter-subject RSAs identified regions where the patterns of brain activity during encoding or retrieving specific videos are similar across participants, indicating a shared spatial organization of the memory representations. We performed three inter-subject RSAs (Enc/ImRet, Enc/DelRet, ImRet/DelRet), the results of which can be seen in Supplementary Figure\u00a0 . Similarly to the within-subject RSAs, these analyses identified several regions associated with the core retrieval network including the PMC, AG (as well as the supramarginal gyrus), the MTG and higher-order visual regions were associated with significant effects in all three analyses. In addition, a region including the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform gyrus was identified in analyses of the correlations between Enc/ImRet (bilaterally) and Enc/DelRet (in the right hemisphere). \n\n\n#### Comparisons of inter-subject RSAs \n  \nTo identify whether any regions showed a consistent alteration in representations of the videos between retrieval and retrieval, we looked for brain regions in which the correlations between ImRet/DelRet were more similar than between Enc/ImRet or Enc/DelRet. The comparison of ImRet/DelRet over Enc/DelRet identified one significant effect in the middle cingulate/pre-SMA region (peak t\u2009=\u20096.4, x\u2009=\u2009\u22125, y\u2009=\u20097, z\u2009=\u200945). However, no effects were found in the PMC, AG, MTG or elsewhere in the brain. Overall the network identified with the inter-subject RSAs is remarkably similar to the core retrieval network seen across within-subject RSAs, confirming the stability of reinstatement across different individuals. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study we investigated the stability of memories for lifelike events over one week. The events were short video clips and their mnemonic representations were indexed by spatial patterns of BOLD activity measured during encoding, immediate retrieval and delayed retrieval. Consistent with previous research, inclusion of an immediate retrieval practice phase of the videos resulted in the creation of durable memories that were recalled in detail at the end of the study. Video-specific patterns of activity throughout many regions of the core retrieval network elicited during encoding were subsequently reinstated during both immediate and delayed retrieval. These patterns were not only stable within individuals but consistent across participants. No regions showed significantly greater reinstatement between the two retrieval phases compared with encoding and retrieval phases. Our findings demonstrate that detailed and vivid retrieval of an episodic memory involves reactivating representations formed during the encoding of an event, even after a week. In contrast, we did not find clear-cut evidence for an alternation in the memory representation caused by the immediate retrieval practice phase of the study. \n\nParticipants watched and silently retrieved videos on the first day of the experiment and then silently retrieved the videos again after a week, before then recalling all videos out loud. Memory performance on the final recall task was good; on average 11.5 details were recalled from each video. A previous study with a very similar procedure found that if participants were shown videos in the scanner but not asked to immediately retrieve them, they could only recall an average of 2.6 details after a week delay (  Experiment 2; see also  Experiment 1 and  for similar findings). Furthermore, in-scanner vividness ratings taken after every retrieval event also indicated that participants were able to vividly retrieve the videos after a week. Taken together, these findings indicate that the participants performed the task as expected and we can infer that processing during the immediate retrieval results in robust memory traces that were retrieved a week later. \n\nMemory retrieval is thought to involve the reactivation of representations that were created at the time of memory encoding . Some of the best evidence for memory reactivation in humans comes from multivariate studies of fMRI data that have demonstrated that event-specific patterns of BOLD activity present during encoding are reinstated at retrieval . However, these studies typically test encoding and retrieval within the same scanning session, leaving open the possibility that such effects are short-lasting and not present after the retention intervals more usually experienced outside of the laboratory. Although some studies have used longer retention intervals, in these cases the videos were extensively rehearsed . The use of highly practiced memories meant that the memories themselves were not unique in place and time \u2013 a key feature of episodic memory  (see  for a discussion of this issue). In our study, we saw that reinstatement effects were robust and widespread when memories were retrieved after a week. This provides some of the strongest support to date that episodic recollection consistently reinstates memory representations created during encoding. \n\nOur study also showed that video-specific patterns of activity are not only stable over time, but they are also consistent across participants. Within the retrieval network, video specific patterns were reinstated between participants, both when comparing encoding with retrieval and when comparing immediate with delayed retrieval. Thus, the activity patterns elicited by each video are present during encoding, immediate and delayed retrieval and share a common distribution across participants. This replicates and extends the study of Chen and colleagues  who recently reported inter-subject correlations whilst participants watched and then immediately recalled an extended video. \n\nReinstatement effects were localized within the core retrieval network . The effects were centered on posterior brain regions, namely bilateral precuneus, bilateral inferior lateral parietal lobe/angular gyrus and bilateral middle temporal/occipital gyrus. This network has been found in many memory retrieval studies and is also thought to guide navigation, self-referential processes, imagining the future and constructing situation models . It is also affected early in the course of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in which episodic memory impairment is the primary symptom . It is thought that these regions represent high-level, relatively abstract information, such as the situational content of an event, rather than low-level sensory information . \n\nIt is possible that our reinstatement effects may reflect the activation of very broad schemas or concepts that are specific to each video. However, in the PMC, posterior hippocampus, MTG and higher-order visual regions, reinstatement between immediate and delayed retrieval correlated with memory performance outside of the scanner (Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ). Furthermore, vividness ratings during retrieval also modulated reinstatement in a largely overlapping set of regions (see Supp. Figure\u00a0 ). Our findings suggest a key role for these regions in the retrieval of rich, sensory details\u2013 the hallmark of episodic recollection. Moreover, it has been argued that active retrieval of memories, triggered by partial cues (such as the video titles used in our study), may promote the rapid consolidation of memories . The association between reinstatement and memory performance within the core retrieval network is consistent with this proposal. \n\nAlthough the effects of similarity between immediate and delayed retrieval were more widespread than between encoding and immediate retrieval (compare Fig.\u00a0  with Supp. Figure\u00a0 ), the differences between these effects were not significant (Supp. Figures\u00a0  and  ). Within one of our primary regions of interest, the PMC, it is clear from Fig.\u00a0  that similar reinstatement effects were observed between encoding, immediate and delayed retrieval. The inter-subject RSAs were consistent with this finding; correlations of spatial patterns of BOLD activity were similarly strong between all three phases. This implies that video-specific representations are established within regions of the core retrieval network during encoding and reinstated to a similar degree whenever the videos are retrieved. \n\nThis finding is consistent with the view that memory retrieval reactivates representations formed during encoding. However, it does not support a popular explanation for the benefits of retrieval practice: that immediate retrieval leads to a transformation or elaboration of the memory representations . If this were the case, retrieval should involve the transformation of the representation of the event into one that is more generic yet reproducible , or involve the incorporation of additional information . In both cases, we would expect to see greater reinstatement between the retrieval phases than between encoding and retrieval \u2013 yet this was not found. Of course, it is possible that any modifications of the memory traces during immediate retrieval were undetectable in our study for a variety of reasons. What we can conclude is that the spatial and temporal grain of fMRI is well-suited to detecting the similarities in memory representations that are present both at encoding and during retrieval. \n\nIn summary, the current study shows that event-specific spatial patterns of BOLD activity established during memory encoding are reinstated during memory retrieval after as long as a week, and that these patterns are similar across individuals. This extends previous findings which have only shown reinstatement effects during the same scanning session or for highly practiced memories. In addition our study is the first to show these similarities between immediate and delayed retrieval. Although retrieval practice is known to reduce forgetting over periods of a week, we found no evidence for any systematic transformation or elaboration of the memory representations during immediate retrieval. Overall, the findings support the view that episodic recollection involves the reactivation of memory representations created during encoding even after long retention intervals. \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5662713, "text_md5": "98839427712ffd12289213a1e6b22ccd", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 86], "journal": [87, 94], "publication_year": [96, 100], "title": [111, 196], "keywords": [210, 210], "abstract": [223, 1468], "body": [1477, 45233]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 29084981, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-13938-4", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5662713", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5662713"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5662713\">5662713</a>", "list_title": "PMC5662713  Reinstatement of memory representations for lifelike events over the course of a week"}

However, most research on this topic is limited to one follow-up time point, and single outcome measures. The present study seeks to add to that literature by employing a more refined assessment of food craving and consumption outcomes along with a more detailed neurobiological model of behavior change over several time points. Here, a community sample of 88 individuals (age:   M   = 39.17,   SD   = 3.47; baseline BMI:   M   = 31.5,   SD   = 3.9, range 24\u201342) with higher body mass index (BMI) performed a food craving reactivity and regulation task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. At that time\u2014and 1, 3, and 6 months later\u2014participants reported craving for and consumption of healthy and unhealthy foods via the Food Craving Inventory (FCI) and ASA24 (N at 6 months = 52\u201355 depending on the measure).   A priori   hypotheses that brain activity associated with both viewing and regulating personally desired unhealthy, energy-dense foods would be associated with self-reported craving for and consumption of unhealthy foods at baseline were not supported by the data. Instead, regression models controlling for age, sex, and BMI demonstrated that brain activity across several regions measured while individuals were regulating their desires for unhealthy food was associated with the self-reported craving for and consumption of healthy food. The hypothesis that vmPFC activity would predict patterns of healthier eating was also not supported. Instead, linear mixed models controlling for baseline age and sex, as well as changes in BMI, revealed that more regulation-related activity in the dlPFC, dACC, IFG, and vmPFC at baseline predicted decreases in the craving for and consumption of healthy foods over the course of 6 months. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFor many of us, simply seeing or smelling something that reminds us of a favorite food can elicit a strong desire for that food. Strong desires, called cravings, often lead to the consumption of that food (e.g.,  ). This frequently occurs for unhealthy or energy-dense foods like snacks and desserts ( ). Consumption of such energy-dense foods is associated with increased risk for overweight [25 kg/m  \u2264 body mass index (BMI) < 30 kg/m ], obesity (BMI \u2265 30 kg/m ), and health consequences associated with higher body weight ( ;  ;  ). \n\nCravings are a form of \u201cfood cue reactivity,\u201d or conditioned responses to food that are frequently accompanied by a suite of experiential, physiological, and neural responses ( ). However, people also work to regulate the cravings they experience, such that they don\u2019t automatically lead to consuming the craved food ( ). A growing body of research has focused on brain activity associated with food cue reactivity and the regulation of these responses, with the goal of explaining how these neural responses predict subsequent health outcomes. At present, this research is mostly limited to studies with one follow-up time point, or a single outcome measure (e.g., BMI, snack consumption;  ;  ). The present study seeks to extend this work by (1) employing a more refined assessment of food preference, craving, and consumption outcomes above and beyond BMI, (2) interrogating these patterns for both healthy and unhealthy foods, and (3) creating a more detailed model of behavior change over multiple time points. \n\n### Behavior Change From Food Cue Reactivity \n  \nThe subjective experience of craving predicts subsequent eating behavior in the presence ( ;  ,  ;  ) and absence of actual food cues ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Recent work suggests that this effect is specific to highly palatable energy-dense foods ( ), which are also those that individuals most often report craving ( ). Craving is related to but separable from liking; where craving implies a motivational state, liking is the hedonic reaction to the pleasure of the reward ( ). As such, a full investigation of the patterns of behavior change from food cue reactivity should interrogate both subjective liking for foods as well as craving for and intake of those foods. \n\nSimilarly, physiological and neural responses to food cues are also prospectively associated with both eating behavior and weight gain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). This literature, while robust, is not uniform; several studies investigating measures of food cue reactivity have failed to demonstrate associations with eating behavior and/or weight, or found an association with physiological cue reactivity but not self-reported reactivity (see  ). A recent meta-analysis by   found a medium effect of food cue reactivity and craving on food consumption and weight (  r   = 0.33), which did not vary based on the presence or absence of an actual food cue to induce the craving. \n\nInterestingly, the bulk of the neurobehavioral work in this area has focused on brain regions associated with reward processing and incentive valuation, including the ventral striatum (VS), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and amygdala ( ). Craving is thought to recruit more of this reward network than liking, but the overlapping neural structures make experimentally separating the two processes quite difficult ( ). Recent evidence suggests that liking may be more associated with BMI than craving ( ), and that food cue reactivity in the VS may be more strongly associated with food consumption than the vmPFC, which tracks with craving ( ). Past work from our lab found that, independent of an individual\u2019s motivational state, activity in a broad network of regions involved in food cue reactivity, including the parahippocampal gyrus, cingulate, inferior occipital gyrus, and anterior insula, predicted consumption of a personally desired unhealthy food, but only in individuals who were not dieting ( ). Other studies have found that activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, a lateral prefrontal region typically implicated in inhibitory control) while viewing food cues was positively associated with weight loss several months later ( ). Therefore, the field\u2019s dominant focus on the mesolimbic dopamine system as the neural seat of food cue reactivity, craving, and consumption may be obscuring the roles of other brain regions and complementary cognitive processes such as liking in predicting these behaviors. \n\n\n### Behavior Change From Food Craving Regulation \n  \nAnother complementary cognitive process is regulation. When individuals view energy-dense foods that they crave, they often don\u2019t passively follow those temptations. People use a variety of methods to regulate cravings for things that aren\u2019t in line with their long term goals ( ). In the face of a tempting food, individuals engage in a variety of food craving regulation strategies. One popular strategy is reappraisal, which entails recontextualizing the food stimulus to change one\u2019s response to it (e.g., focusing on the negative consequences of eating a desired but unhealthy food;  ). Indeed, the tendency and capacity to engage in food craving regulation varies substantially among individuals ( ), supporting the notion that obesity, overweight, and the consumption of unhealthy foods is much more complex than differences in cue reactivity and craving. Behavioral measures of food craving regulation have been found to predict changes in the consumption of both healthy and unhealthy food over time ( ;  ). \n\nRegulating the motivation to consume a desired unhealthy food relies heavily on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is implicated in the control over human behaviors, actions, and thoughts. When individuals are instructed to reappraise or suppress their cravings for food, increased activity in the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and inferior temporal lobe is regularly observed ( ;  ). A recent meta-analysis found that BMI is negatively associated with activity in the left dlPFC, right ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC), and IFG during regulation, which suggests that individuals with higher BMIs may be less able to recruit the lateral PFC to regulate their food choices ( ). Indeed, it is believed that lateral regions like the dlPFC modulate incentive valuation and reward processing within medial regions like the vmPFC and ventral striatum, which then affects the likelihood that individuals will select food items on the basis of healthiness compared to taste ( ;  , though see  ). Of these regions, the vmPFC is uniquely thought to support value-based decision-making ( ), in which choice options are assigned subjective values and a decision is made through a dynamic integration process of gains and costs. Assessments of vmPFC activation during decision-making, including in this study, typically take place before consumption as people consider their degree of motivation to approach (e.g., eat or purchase) the food stimuli. As such, vmPFC activation as measured by tasks such as the one used in this study can be considered an index of \u201cwanting\u201d as opposed to \u201cliking.\u201d \n\nMoving laterally, further evidence for the role of the lateral PFC in regulation comes from experimental manipulation of dlPFC activity. Stimulation of this region attenuates food cravings and the consumption of energy-dense foods in individuals who report strong food cravings, and inhibiting dlPFC activity is associated with overconsumption of energy-dense foods via changes in inhibitory control ( ). While there is considerable evidence linking eating behavior to brain activity (see  ), additional evidence supports the effect of weight on brain function. Recent work on individuals who underwent bariatric surgery revealed that weight loss resulted in significant increases in dlPFC activity during food appraisal ( ). As such, this literature suggests a strong but bidirectional association between lateral PFC activity and eating behavior. Thus, according to  , weaker lateral PFC responses to food cues may increase individual susceptibility to the rewarding properties of energy-dense foods, which prompts overconsumption, which then, over time, leads to lateral PFC dysregulation, exacerbated sensitivity to food rewards, and increased adiposity. While this model is intriguing, few studies have attempted to reconcile this PFC-centered model with the large literature implicating mesolimbic food cue reactivity in predicting food craving and consumption or the recent work indicating that both reactivity and regulation information are integrated in the vmPFC. \n\n\n### The Present Study \n  \nThe present study aimed to address this gap by measuring brain activity associated with both food cue reactivity and regulation, and prospectively investigating how it predicted changes in self-reported liking of, craving for, and consumption of both healthy and unhealthy foods over the course of 6 months in a sample of middle-aged adults with higher BMIs. \n\nFirst, we hypothesized that brain activity associated with both viewing and regulating personally desired unhealthy, energy-dense foods would be associated with self-reported craving and consumption of unhealthy foods at baseline. We also explored the association between brain activity and liking of, craving for, and consumption of healthy foods in order to examine the specificity of this effect to unhealthy food. Second, we hypothesized that activity in the vmPFC during the viewing of unhealthy foods would mediate the association between regulation-related brain activity and self-reported craving for and/or consumption of these foods. Third, we hypothesized that value-related brain activity in the vmPFC during food craving regulation at baseline would predict a decrease in the consumption of unhealthy food and an increase in the consumption of healthy food over 6 months. We also explored the role of other brain regions in predicting eating behavior change. \n\n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA community sample of 105 middle-aged individuals with higher BMIs who intended to eat more healthfully were screened and enrolled into a larger project investigating a text message-based intervention aimed to improve eating habits. Inclusion criteria for the overarching study included (1) an approximate BMI between 25\u201340; (2) early, middle-age (i.e., approximately 35\u201345 years old); (3) no psychiatric, neurological, or eating disorders; (4) no fMRI contraindications; (5) not actively enrolled in a diet program or any other type of eating intervention; and (6) self-reported desire to eat more healthfully. Ten participants were excluded for non-compliance or repeatedly missing appointments, or decided to drop out before completion of the baseline session. A further 7 participants were excluded from the MRI analyses because they had excessive motion artifacts (defined below;   n   = 2), were not compliant with enrollment criteria (  n   = 2), had structural anomalies (  n   = 1), or for whom timing data were lost due to a technical error (  n   = 2). Therefore, analyses for this study are from the 88 individuals who provided useable MRI data (age:   M   = 39.2,   SD   = 3.57, range 33\u201346; baseline BMI:   M   = 31.5,   SD   = 3.9, range 24\u201342); they did not differ with regard to age or BMI from those who provided MRI data that were not useable. These participants were 81.91% female, and 79.5% identified as Caucasian, 8% Hispanic, 3.4% Black (not of Hispanic origin), 2.3% Middle Eastern, 1.1% each South Asian and American Indian/Alaskan Native, and 3.4% other. \n\nAn   a priori   power analysis was not conducted for this study; sample size was determined by budget and the duration of the grant award period. A   post hoc   power analysis in G Power ( ) indicated that we were adequately powered to test for medium-sized brain-behavior associations at baseline (f  = 0.156, with power = 0.8, \u03b1 = 0.05, 5 predictors). With regard to change over time, we achieved up to 89% power (time x dlPFC interaction predicting craving for healthy foods) according to   post hoc   power simulations using simr ( ). However, many of the other findings were underpowered and should be interpreted accordingly. Hypotheses and analytical procedures for this study were preregistered at the Open Science Framework . \n\n\n### Protocol \n  \nParticipants were recruited for this study using a combination of online, newspaper, and public advertising. Interested individuals were screened for exclusion criteria via phone, and eligible participants were sent a battery of measures to complete before arriving for their baseline session. Participants were scheduled for their baseline lab visit, and asked to complete the pre-baseline measures within 24 h of the visit. Pre-baseline measures included demographic information, assessments of eating behavior, self-reported food craving and liking, and a set of psychometric measures not presented here. Participants were instructed to not eat anything for at least an hour before the baseline visit. During the baseline (T1) visit, participants provided informed consent, after which they were screened for MRI contraindications and instructed on the requirements of the study. Weight and height were measured, after which participants took part in an MRI session (described below). After the MRI session, they were randomized into intervention and control groups. The intervention, in which participants received self-authored text messages aligning healthy eating with personal values for 28 days after T1, did not have a significant effect on changes in BMI, healthy eating, or food craving compared to the control condition, where participants received standardized healthy eating messages. For the purposes of the analyses pursued here of measures acquired after randomization to condition, individuals were collapsed across groups, with group assignment controlled in the statistical models as a dummy-coded variable. \n\nAfter the 28 days follow-up period, participants returned to the lab where they repeated all baseline measures with the exception of demographics and the MRI session (T2). Eating behavior was assessed over two separate days in advance of the visit. Three months after baseline (T3), participants were emailed instructions as to how to provide information on eating behavior and self-reported food craving and liking online. Six months after baseline (T4), participants returned to the lab where they repeated the procedures of the T2 visit. \n\n\n### Measures \n  \n#### Body Mass Index (BMI) \n  \nWeight and height were measured using a commercially available weight scale and wall ruler, and BMI was calculated by dividing the participant\u2019s weight in kilograms by height in square meters. These measures were collected in the laboratory at T1, T2, and T4. The number of participants from whom we collected this information at each time point is listed in  . \n  \nDemographic and self-report information. \n    \n\n#### Food Craving Inventory (FCI) \n  \nThe FCI ( ) is a 67-item self-report measure of cravings for and liking of specific foods. Craving was defined as \u201can intense desire for a specific food that is difficult to resist.\u201d Participants were asked to rate the frequency of cravings for the past 30 days on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = \u201cnot at all,\u201d 5 = \u201cnearly every day\u201d). They were also asked to rate how much they liked each food on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = \u201cdislike,\u201d 4 = \u201clove\u201d). \n\nFoods were grouped into categories and ratings in each category were averaged for craving and liking separately. The foods included in each category are listed in the  . We created composite measures of liking of and craving for unhealthy foods by averaging across ratings in the following categories: processed meats, fried foods, red meats, sugary foods, and empty calories. The same procedure was followed for healthy foods with the following categories: vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, whole grains, and olive oil. \n\n\n#### ASA24 \n  \nEating behavior was assessed via the Automated Self-Administered 24 h (ASA24 ) Dietary Assessment Tool ( ) which allows for the calculation of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI;  ) using calculations provided by the developers of the ASA . Following the recommendations proposed by the developers of this measure, participants completed the ASA twice at each time point to obtain a more representative estimate of daily eating behavior. We used the HEI as our measure of healthy eating as it quantifies how well a person\u2019s eating behavior aligns with recommended dietary guidelines for Americans. We also created an average of HEI indices 1\u20134, which captured daily consumption of total vegetables, greens and beans, total fruit, and whole fruit. In addition, we used the ASA24\u2019s calculation of total kilocalories consumed and empty calories consumed. All data were averaged across the 2 days of data collection at each time point. \n\n\n#### Regulation of Craving (ROC) Task \n  \nParticipants were trained to decrease their desire to consume personally-desired (for task purposes these are referred to as \u201ccraved\u201d foods) foods using cognitive reappraisal ( ;  ). Participants viewed unhealthy craved foods (\u201cCraved\u201d condition), unhealthy not-craved foods (\u201cNot Craved\u201d condition), or healthy vegetables (\u201cNeutral\u201d condition). For unhealthy craved foods, participants either actively viewed the foods (\u201cLook\u201d condition) or reappraised their craving for them (\u201cRegulate\u201d condition). On \u201cLook\u201d trials, participants imagined how they would interact with the food if it were in front of them. On \u201cRegulate\u201d trials, participants reappraised the foods by focusing on the short- or long-term negative health consequences associated with consumption (e.g., stomach aches, weight gain, cavities, etc.). Participants generated several negative health consequences with the help of the experimenter, to ensure they had multiple reappraisals they could use during the task. To minimize demand characteristics (e.g., reduced craving ratings on regulate trials), participants were reassured they were not expected to be able to regulate well on every trial and were told that it was important to rate their cravings honestly. Neutral stimuli were only viewed under \u201cLook\u201d instructions, and are not used in the present analyses. To keep task time to a minimum, only craved foods were viewed under \u201cRegulate\u201d instructions. \n\nTo maximize craving, participants selected their most craved and least craved food from the following menu of unhealthy food categories for the \u201cCrave\u201d and \u201cNot Craved\u201d conditions respectively: chocolate, cookies, donuts, French fries, ice cream, pasta, pizza. Stimuli were independently rated for desirability, such that the mean desirability of stimuli within each unhealthy food category did not differ significantly across categories ( ). As such, each participant viewed a set of individually adapted unhealthy food stimulus categories; across all participants, the only domain on which the \u201cCraved\u201d and \u201cNot Craved\u201d conditions differed was with regard to individual food preferences. Each condition (Look Neutral, Look Craved, Look Not Craved, and Regulate Craved) had 20 trials, presented across two task runs. On each trial (see  ), participants are presented with an instruction (2 s; Look or Regulate), viewed a food image while following the instruction (5 s), and rated their craving for the food on a 5-point Likert scale (4 s; 1 = not at all, 5 = very much). Each 11s trial of this event-related design was followed by a jittered fixation cross (  M   = 1 s) and trial order is optimized using a genetic algorithm ( ). Stimuli were presented using Psychtoolbox 3 ( ), and participants responded using a five-button box. \n  \nExample trials from the ROC task. \n  \n\n\n### Neuroimaging Data Acquisition and Preprocessing \n  \nNeuroimaging data were acquired on a 3T Siemens Skyra scanner at the University of Oregon Lewis Center for Neuroimaging. We acquired a high-resolution anatomical T1-weighted MP-RAGE scan (TR/TE = 2,500.00/3.43 ms, 256 \u00d7 256 matrix, 1 mm thick, 176 sagittal slices, FOV = 208 \u00d7 208 mm), functional images with a T2 - weighted echo-planar sequence (72 axial slices, TR/TE = 2,000.00/27.00 ms, 90-degree flip angle, 100 \u00d7 100 matrix, 2 mm thick, FOV = 208 \u00d7 208 mm, multiband acceleration factor = 3), and opposite phase encoded echo-planar images to correct for magnetic field inhomogeneities (72 axial slices, TR/TE = 6,390.00/47.80 ms, 90-degree flip angle, 104 \u00d7 104 matrix, 2 mm thick, FOV = 208 \u00d7 208 mm). \n\nNeuroimaging data were preprocessed using fMRIPrep 1.1.4 ( ). A detailed account of the preprocessing pipeline appears in  , but briefly, anatomical images were segmented and normalized to MNI space using FreeSurfer ( ); functional images were susceptibility distortion corrected, realigned, and coregistered to the normalized anatomical images. Normalized functional data were then smoothed (6 mm FWHM) in SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology ). \n\n\n### Neuroimaging Analysis \n  \nEvent-related condition effects were estimated in first-level analyses using a fixed-effects general linear model and convolving a canonical hemodynamic response function to stimulus events using SPM12. Regressors were entered for each experimental condition (regulate craved, look craved, look not-craved, look neutral) and were modeled during stimulus presentation (5 s). Additional regressors of no interest were added for the instruction and rating periods. Five motion regressors were modeled as covariates of no interest. Realignment parameters were transformed into Euclidean distance for translation and rotation separately; we also included the displacement derivative of each, resulting in a total of four motion regressors. Another regressor of no interest indicated images with motion artifacts (e.g., striping) identified via automated motion assessment ( ) or visual inspection. Data were high-pass filtered at 128s and temporal autocorrelation was modeled using FAST ( ). Task runs with > 10% of volumes contaminated with motion artifacts were excluded (  n   = 8) or if they were missing 80% or more responses (  n   = 5). Participants were excluded completely if both task runs were excluded (  N   = 4). For each participant, we computed the following linear contrasts: Look Craved > Look Not Craved (LC > LNC, called \u201creactivity\u201d) and Regulate Crave > Look Crave (RC > LC, called \u201cregulation\u201d) using SPM12. \n\nWe estimated second-level random effects for each contrast using a one-sample   t  -test in SPM12. Multiple comparisons were corrected using cluster-extent thresholding implemented in AFNI version 18.2.04 ( ). In accordance with recent guidelines ( ), the spatial autocorrelation function was first estimated for each subject and task run separately using AFNI\u2019s 3dFWHMx, and then averaged across subjects. To determine probability estimates of false-positive clusters given a random field of noise, Monte-Carlo simulations were conducted with AFNI\u2019s 3dClustSim using the average autocorrelation across subjects (ACF = 0.70, 4.27, 8.63). For each model, a voxel-wise threshold of   p   < 0.001 and cluster extent of k = 61 was estimated (voxel dimensions = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm) to achieve a whole-brain familywise error rate of \u03b1 = 0.05. \n\n\n### ROI Definition and Extraction \n  \nRegion of interests were defined anatomically due to the   a priori   nature of our hypotheses. The VS and vmPFC ROIs were from Bartra and colleagues\u2019 (2013) publicly available database of ROIs based on a 200 paper meta-analysis of subjective value ( ) . The dlPFC, IFG, and dACC ROIs were all created using the WFU PickAtlas ( ;  ). For the dlPFC ROI, we selected Brodmann areas 8 and 9, and dilated the mask by 1mm. The IFG ROI was defined using the WFU PickAtlas TD Labels inferior frontal gyrus ROI. The dACC ROI was created by bounding the WFU PickAtlas TD Labels anterior cingulate ROI on the y-axis at 0\u201332. Per our hypotheses, we extracted individual parameter estimates from the VS and vmPFC ROIs from the LC > LNC contrast, and dlPFC, IFG, and dACC ROIs from the RC > LC contrast. These three regulation ROIs were averaged and combined into a composite for analysis purposes, and also explored separately. \n\nIn addition, we explored associations between regulation-related brain activity and food craving (from the FCI) and consumption (from the ASA24) by creating 6 mm  spherical ROIs around the peaks from the RC > LC contrast (listed in  , labeled with an  ). The purpose of these ROIs was to explore the association of regulation-related brain activity with longitudinal patterns of healthy and unhealthy food liking, craving, and consumption orthogonal to the contrast that defined the ROIs. These seven ROIs were averaged and combined into a composite to reduce the number of statistical tests run, and also explored separately. \n  \nCorrelations at baseline (T1). \n    \n\n### Statistical Analyses \n  \nStatistical analyses were conducted in R (version 3.6.1;  ). First, variables were investigated for skewness and kurtosis; all exhibited acceptable distributions and were retained for further analysis. We then created a series of multilevel models predicting liking, craving, and intake of healthy and unhealthy foods with time at Level 1 and person at Level 2 using lmer in R ( ). Because the models failed to converge when including the linear effect of time (month slope) as a random effect, only participant intercepts were modeled as random effects. The time variable (number of months since T1) was centered at 0, and the rest of the variables were grand mean centered. These models included main effects of brain activity, BMI, age, gender, and condition at baseline, as well as the main effect of time and the interaction between time and brain activity. Lastly, we investigated the pattern of missingness in this data set using the non-parametric MCAR (Missing Completely at Random) test proposed by  , as implemented in the MissMech R package,  ). Here, a significant result for the Hawkins test of normality and homoscedasticity indicates that the hypothesis of MCAR would be rejected, and results should be interpreted accordingly. \n\nTo interrogate hypothesis 1, that food craving reactivity and regulation brain activity would be associated with self-reported craving for and consumption of unhealthy food at baseline, we assessed these models for main effects of brain activity on FCI-reported craving for unhealthy foods and ASA24-reported consumption of empty calories. Because eight separate models (4 ROIs \u00d7 2 dependent variables) were run to address this hypothesis, a Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple comparisons. The corrected alpha was therefore set at   p   < 0.0063. Additional models assessing self-reported liking of unhealthy foods were also included, in order to separate out the motivational state (craving) from the hedonic response (liking). We also explored the associations between brain activity and the liking of, craving for, and consumption of healthy foods at baseline, in order to examine the specificity of previously reported brain-behavior associations by food type. Because these analyses were exploratory, we only report estimates and 95% confidence intervals for effects that surpass \u03b1 < 0.05 in the text; all results are included in supplementary material available online . To interrogate hypothesis 2, that vmPFC activity would mediate the relation between regulation-related brain activity and unhealthy food craving and/or consumption, we planned to run mediation models in R using lavaan ( ) for any and all significant associations between regulation-related brain activity and behavior at baseline. These models would be constructed as follows: regulation-related brain activity would be the independent variable; reactivity-related vmPFC activity would be the mediator; the craving or consumption variable associated with regulation-related activity would be the dependent variable; and BMI, age, gender, and condition included as covariates. Lastly, to interrogate hypothesis 3, that vmPFC brain activity associated with regulating the desire for personally desired energy-dense foods at baseline would predict an increase in the consumption of healthy food and a decrease in unhealthy food over 6 months, we examined the time x brain interaction terms from the multilevel models. We additionally explored other reactivity- and regulation-related brain activity in other regions for this interaction on liking of, craving for, and consumption of both food types. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Baseline \n  \nBaseline data from the FCI and the ASA24 are presented in  , along with relevant demographic information. Correlations among non-brain variables at baseline are presented in  . BMI was significantly positively correlated with self-reported craving for unhealthy [  r  (88) = 0.260,   p   = 0.014] foods. Liking and craving were significantly correlated for both healthy [  r  (88) = 0.467,   p   < 0.001] and unhealthy [  r  (88) = 0.592,   p   < 0.001] foods. Total calories consumed was positively correlated with self-reported liking of unhealthy foods [  r  (87) = 0.263,   p   = 0.015], and negatively correlated with consumption of empty calories [  r  (87) = \u22120.322,   p   = 0.002]. The ASA24\u2019s HEI was positively correlated with fruit and vegetable consumption [  r  (87) = 0.680,   p   < 0.001] and empty calories [  r  (87) = 0.578,   p   < 0.001]; it was not significantly associated with liking or craving of healthy foods (  p  -values > 0.24). Consumption of empty calories was significantly negatively associated with self-reported liking of unhealthy foods [  r  (85) = \u22120.221,   p   = 0.042] and total calories consumed [  r  (87) = \u22120.322,   p   = 0.002]. \n\nAs shown in  , whole brain results for the main effect of food cue reactivity revealed significant clusters in the left postcentral gyrus, right lingual gyrus, right fusiform gyrus, and right inferior temporal gyrus. Peaks and cluster sizes are listed in  . The main effect of regulation was associated with a very large cluster of activity with subpeaks in the left supramarginal gyrus, right post-medial frontal gyrus, and left inferior gyrus. Additional peaks were located in the right supramarginal gyrus, midbrain, left cerebellum, and left parahippocampal gyrus (  and  ). \n  \nWhole brain maps of   (A)   reactivity and   (B)   regulation.   p   > 0.001,   k   = 61. \n    \nRegions, MNI coordinates, cluster sizes, and peak t values for the Look Craved > Look Not Craved and Regulate Craved > Look Craved main effects (  p   < 0.001,   k   = 61 threshold used for all contrasts). \n    \nIn contrast to Hypothesis 1, reactivity-related activity in neither the VS ROI nor the vmPFC ROI was significantly associated with self-reported craving for or consumption of unhealthy foods at baseline. Average regulation-related brain activity in neither the   a priori   ROIs nor the peak ROIs were significantly associated with self-reported craving for or consumption of unhealthy foods. Full models are available in the supplementary material available online (see footnote). \n\nRegulation-related activity in the average of the   a priori   ROIs was positively associated with consumption of fruits and vegetables,   B   = 0.73, 95% CI [0.08, 1.37], SE = 0.33,   t  (108.06) = 2.24,   p   = 0.027. Exploration of the individual ROIs revealed that this effect was only statistically significant in the dlPFC,   B   = 0.68, 95% CI [0.07, 1.28], SE = 0.31,   t  (108.96) = 2.21,   p   = 0.029. In addition, regulation-related activity in the vmPFC   a priori   ROI was positively associated with craving for healthy foods,   B   = 0.27, 95% CI [0.02, 0.52], SE = 0.13,   t  (90.80) = 2.11,   p   = 0.037. While the average of the peak ROIs from the RC > LC contrast was not significantly associated with liking, craving, or consumption, individual peaks showed intriguing associations with behavior at baseline. Left cerebellum activity (\u22126, \u221256, \u221244) was positively associated with the HEI,   B   = 4.18, 95% CI [0.64, 7.72], SE = 1.79,   t  (124.12) = 2.34,   p   = 0.021, and fruit and vegetable intake,   B   = 0.58, 95% CI [0.21, 0.95], SE = 0.18,   t  (109.81) = 3.13,   p   = 0.002. This pattern was also observed in the right supramarginal gyrus [64, \u221246, 36; HEI:   B   = 4.07, 95% CI [0.63, 7.52], SE = 1.74,   t  (123.28) = 2.34,   p   = 0.021; fruit and vegetable intake:   B   = 0.49, 95% CI [0.13, 0.85], SE = 0.18,   t  (110.40) = 2.72,   p   = 0.008]. Lastly, activity in the right post-medial frontal peak (6, 12, 70) showed an inverse relationship with the consumption of empty calories,   B   = \u22121.80, 95% CI [\u22123.50, \u22120.09], SE = 0.86,   t  (136.97) = \u22122.08,   p   = 0.039. Because Hypothesis 1 was not supported by the data, the criteria for assessing the mediation outlined in Hypothesis 2 was also not met. \n\n\n### Change Over Time \n  \nAs shown in  , there was notable attrition over time. A test for the nature of the missing data revealed that these data were not Missing Completely At Random (Hawkins Test   p   < 0.001). However, follow-up group comparisons between participants who provided data at all three follow-up time points compared to those who did not indicated that these groups did not significantly differ with regard to age, gender, intervention condition, reactivity or regulation-related brain activity, or baseline BMI, healthy eating (both HEI and fruit/vegetable consumption), or liking/craving for healthy and unhealthy foods. The individuals who provided complete data did, however, report consuming significantly fewer calories per day at baseline compared to those who provided incomplete data,   F  (1, 85) = 4.61,   p   = 0.035. As such, the following results should be interpreted with this limitation in mind. \n\nWith regard to Hypothesis 3, linear mixed models controlling for changes in BMI and age, gender, and intervention condition indicated that regulation-related activity in the vmPFC ROI was not associated with changes in the consumption of unhealthy food over time, operationalized as self-reported intake of empty calories via the ASA24. It was, however, significantly associated with changes in fruit and vegetable intake over time,   B   = \u22120.11, 95% CI [\u22120.21, \u22120.00], SE = 0.05,   t  (137.64) = \u22122.03,   p   = 0.045. A visual interrogation of this effect revealed a crossover interaction ( ), such that individuals who recruited more vmPFC activity during the regulation of the desire to consume unhealthy food reported consuming fewer fruits and vegetables over time, whereas those who displayed less vmPFC activity during regulation reported eating more fruits and vegetables. \n  \nVisualization of the time x vmPFC activity interaction predicting changes in self-reported fruit and vegetable intake over time via the ASA24.

It was also seen in the average regulation-related brain activity across the three   a priori   ROIs for changes in healthy food craving,   B   = \u22120.08, 95% CI [\u22120.14, \u22120.02], SE = 0.03,   t  (124.50) = \u22122.84,   p   = 0.005, and only in the dlPFC ROI with regard to changes in the consumption of fruits and vegetables,   B   = \u22120.14, 95% CI [\u22120.27, \u22120.00], SE = 0.07,   t  (134.70) = \u22122.00,   p   = 0.047. Visual inspection of the healthy craving interaction across all three ROIs ( ) indicated that people who recruited these brain regions more during regulation showed a decrease in their self-reported craving for healthy food over time, which was not seen in individuals who did not recruit these regulation network regions as strongly. Additional model results that did not pass the significance threshold are included in the   online. \n  \nVisualization of the time x activity interaction predicting changes in self-reported craving for healthy foods over time via the ASA24.

This is surprising, given that the bulk of the brain-behavior research in this area has focused on food cue reactivity, and that a recent meta-analysis of this literature demonstrated a medium effect of food cue reactivity on food consumption and weight ( ). Because we controlled for BMI in our analyses in order to focus on brain-behavior associations, we may have obscured any weight-related effects. However,   post hoc   analyses showed that there was also no association between baseline BMI and reactivity-related brain activity in the present sample [  r  (88)-values = 0.024\u20130.087,   p   > 0.41]. As such, removing variance associated with BMI most likely did not obscure any weight-driven brain-behavior associations at baseline. It is also possible that these null results could be related to the contrast we used to operationalize reactivity in the brain. As evident in  , there were very few clusters that differed significantly between the craved (LC) and not craved (LNC) foods, indicating that reactivity was similar across conditions, despite substantial differences in self-reported craving ratings for craved and not craved foods ( ). Because this measure of cue reactivity does not appear to have been specific to craved foods here, it may account for not observing the expected relationships. Lastly, these null findings may also be due to limitations inherent to the self-report measures we used to assess food craving and consumption (e.g., self-presentation bias, imperfect memory recall). Accurate measurement of food consumption is notoriously challenging, and while the ASA24 retrospective food intake measure used in the present study is the measure of choice for the National Cancer Institute, a recent paper documented several usability challenges with this tool that may have led to reporting errors ( ). \n\n\n#### Regulation \n  \nWe also did not see any significant baseline associations between regulation-related activity and self-reported liking of, craving for, or consumption of unhealthy foods in our   a priori   ROIs. However, exploratory analyses revealed that regulation-related brain activity was positively associated with the craving for and consumption of healthy foods. Specifically, activity in an average of our three   a priori   ROIs (dlPFC, dACC, IFG) was significantly positively associated with fruit and vegetable consumption, which appeared to be driven by dlPFC activity. We also saw this effect with regard to healthy food craving in the vmPFC, and general healthy eating as well as fruit/vegetable intake in the left cerebellum and right supramarginal gyrus. We also found that right post-medial frontal activity was negatively associated with empty calorie consumption. \n\nTogether, these data demonstrate that greater engagement of these regions during the regulation of the desire for unhealthy food was associated with concurrent healthier eating. Activation in these regions could also be indexing health goals representations ( ), motivation to change, or effort on and engagement with the task of down-regulating craving for unhealthy foods. While we expected to see this pattern in the traditional lateral prefrontal regions like the dlPFC, we were somewhat surprised that the cerebellum and supramarginal gyrus also showed such a consistent pattern of associations with healthy eating. These two regions are generally thought to underlie mentalizing and other types of social cognition ( ), yet some studies have found them to be significantly involved in cognitive control (e.g.,  ). Therefore, it may be that individuals who engage these regions during regulation may be\u2014consciously or subconsciously\u2014using more socially-relevant regulation strategies, which may be associated with greater healthy food intake. While we have explored different types of craving regulation strategies in past work (see  ), these have not yet included social strategies ( ). \n\nThe fact that almost all of the baseline associations we observed were in the domain of healthy eating also supports the assertion that our present lack of reactivity-consumption findings\u2014which are traditionally seen in the domain of unhealthy food (e.g.,  )\u2014may be due to the increased motivation of our participants to eat better. The specificity of the results to the healthy food domain may also be why we found relatively few effects on craving for these foods, as there are not as frequently craved as unhealthy foods ( ). Interestingly, we also found no brain-behavior associations regarding the self-reported liking of healthy foods, which suggests that this pattern is specific to the motivational and ingestive aspects of eating behavior, and not the more subjective process of liking. \n\n\n\n### Change Over Time \n  \n#### Reactivity \n  \nWith regard to baseline levels of brain activity predicting overall changes in food liking, craving, and consumption over the course of the 6 month follow-up period, we did not find any evidence that brain activity during food cue reactivity predicted behavior changes in the domains of unhealthy or healthy foods. These results are contrary to much of the previous findings in this domain, which have shown relatively consistent associations between food cue reactivity and behavior change using dependent variables such as weight gain/loss, cue-induced eating, or snack consumption (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ). The present null result may be due to the paradigm we used to index food cue reactivity, which contrasted two energy-dense foods that only differed based on participant preference. This is quite different from most other studies in this domain, which usually contrast high energy-dense foods with low-density foods, if a contrasting condition is used at all. In addition, these results may be due to the sample, which consisted of community adults who were selected because they had BMIs between 25 and 40 but were also highly motivated to improve their eating habits. As such, the increased motivation of the subjects may have negated any hypothesized reactivity-consumption associations by influencing both brain reactivity to pictures of unhealthy foods and consumption of those foods. \n\n\n#### Regulation \n  \nIn contrast to the reactivity results, we did find that brain activity associated with regulating the desire for unhealthy foods was significantly associated with changes in craving for and consumption of healthy foods. Specifically, we found that increased regulation-related activity in the dlPFC, IFG, dACC, and vmPFC significantly predicted decreases in healthy food craving over time. Regulation-related activity in the dlPFC and vmPFC also predicted a decrease in self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption. Across all of these regions, greater engagement during regulation predicted less craving for and consumption of healthy foods over time. While the brain regions implicated here are those we expected would track with real-world regulation success, we found an opposite pattern than predicted:   less   brain activity during regulation was associated with   more   craving for and consumption of healthy foods. \n\nThis pattern of brain-as-predictor results is complex and somewhat contradictory, with more regulation-related activity associated with healthier eating at baseline, which then waned over the course of 6 months. One possible explanation is simply that craving regulation is multifaceted, reflecting many psychological processes including effort, attentional control, motivation, desire, meta-cognition and planning, among others. As such, simply asking people to indicate their food desire ratings via a button press after attempting to down-regulate their desire for a food may not get at the complexity of the process (e.g., effort, conflict, etc.). In addition, we used mean-level activation within ROIs as brain-based indices of reactivity and regulation, but because they are not specific indicators of these psychological processes, they likely represent integrated engagement of numerous cognitive functions. Future studies should investigate multivariate measures of reactivity and regulation to improve sensitivity and potentially predictive utility ( ). Regardless, the present findings suggest that the health neuroscience literature may benefit from an increased interrogation of the factors predicting healthy food consumption, instead of continuing to focus primarily on reducing the consumption of unhealthy food. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, some features of the sample itself are worth considering and might provide clues that help interpret the observed pattern of response. The sample consisted of community adults who were selected because they had higher BMIs, and also highly motivated to improve their eating habits. Indeed, it may be that this increased motivation to eat better upon study entry was reflected in both greater effort during regulation\u2014which resulted in more brain activity\u2014and healthier baseline eating behavior. Cognitive reappraisal, the regulation strategy employed in the present study, is thought to be relatively less effortful compared to more response-focused regulation strategies like suppression ( ). However, this work was done using negative images; neural reactions to unhealthy food cues have been found to occur early and are relatively automatic ( ). As such, reappraising the desire for a delicious-looking unhealthy food may actually be a form of late reappraisal, which has been shown to engage substantial inhibitory control resources ( ). This level of effort is hard to maintain in the long run, which is why greater recruitment of these brain regions at baseline ultimately resulted in a downward trajectory of healthy eating over 6 months. These results suggest that targeting less effortful food craving regulation strategies may be more successful in helping people meet their healthy eating goals over longer periods of time. Recent work by   supports this idea, showing that greater success at up-regulating the desire for healthy foods was associated with increased craving strength for low-calorie foods as well as decreased consumption of high-calorie foods in their daily lives. \n\n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe present findings should be interpreted in light of several limitations of the present study. First, the sample was majority female and Caucasian. We did employ broad recruitment in the community of a mid-sized city in the Pacific Northwest, United States, but the limited gender and racial makeup of the present sample may limit the generalizability of the present findings to other samples. In addition, the sample was entirely higher BMI, with no comparison group. As such, the patterns of results in this study may be reflective of this specific group, who may also process stimuli and approach food in ways different from lower-weight individuals. Second, while we excluded individuals who were actively enrolled in a diet program, we did not collect information about past diet attempts or weight fluctuations. Because previous studies have found an influence of dietary behavior on brain activity (e.g.,  ), this is an important caveat to the present results that should be addressed in future work. Third, while we worked hard to retain our sample throughout the full 6 month study protocol, we experienced substantial attrition, with only 52 of the original 88 participants providing BMI data at T4. A comparison of the participants who provided data throughout the study versus those who did not revealed that they did not differ significantly with regard to age, gender, or ethnicity. However, we cannot assess how this attrition may have impacted our longitudinal outcome measures, as we do not have follow-up data from participants who did not return to the lab at T4. Relatedly, participants reported that inventorying their 24-h food consumption using the ASA24 twice at each time point was cumbersome, which may have led to loss of follow-up data and perhaps also contributed to careless or more inaccurate reporting among those who did complete the follow-up assessments ( ). While accurately measuring actual food consumption is notoriously difficult, future work would benefit from employing a measure of food intake that participants are more likely to complete at multiple time points (i.e., taking photos of meals). Lastly, half of the participants in these analyses were enrolled in an intervention designed to increase their motivation to engage in healthier eating behaviors. While we collapsed across groups and included intervention condition as a covariate in all analyses, the fact that half of the participants had received this intervention between baseline and T2 may have affected the self-reported food craving and consumption data we collected at all three time points. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOverall, this study demonstrated that brain activity associated with regulating desires for unhealthy food predicted meaningful changes in the craving for and consumption of healthy food over the course of 6 months in a population of middle-aged adults with higher BMIs. These nuanced findings add to the growing body of research on the neuroscience of eating, which has predominantly focused on the consumption of unhealthy foods and/or body weight, and highlights the importance of studying healthy eating behavior as well. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

In conclusion, our research provided evidence of the common neural correlates of monetary loss and pain. \n  \nRegardless of the type of pain experienced, activation of the anterior insula was a shared neural representation of monetary loss and pain. The network representation pattern of monetary loss was more similar to that of social pain than that of physical pain.    \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nMoney is considered to have multiple psychological meanings for its functions of exchanging goods and services, and motivating others (Lea & Webley,\u00a0 ). For example, money can elicit both positive and negative emotions (Tang,\u00a0 ), inspire individuals\u2019 internal motivations (Lea & Webley,\u00a0 ), reduce the harm caused by low self\u2010esteem (Zhang,\u00a0 ), and transform the norms of interpersonal relationships (Vohs, Mead, & Goode,\u00a0 ; Zaleskiewicz & Gasiorowska,\u00a0 ). Monetary loss refers to the loss of money (Kamarajan et al.,\u00a0 ), which can alter individuals\u2019 behavior and mental states. Individuals report more negative emotions after monetary loss relative to monetary gains (Jang, Lin, & Lustig,\u00a0 ). Monetary loss can also act as punishment to improve individuals\u2019 behavioral performance (Li, Cox, Or, & Blandford,\u00a0 ). \n\nPeople often viewed the experience of monetary loss as undesirable and disgusting. For example, people usually described the experience of monetary loss with words that described physically painful experiences such as using the word \u201cheadache\u201d to depict the psychological state of receiving a costly bill (Xu, Zhou, Ye, & Zhou,\u00a0 ). Moreover, some researchers have found that monetary loss directly affects individuals\u2019 sensitivity to pain, since monetary loss might amplify the painful feelings of nociceptive stimuli or social exclusion (Zhou, Vohs, & Baumeister,\u00a0 ). \n\nAll these results suggested a psychological overlap between monetary loss and pain including physical pain and social pain, two typical types of pain, which have been widely investigated in pain\u2010related research (Merskey,\u00a0 ). Physical pain refers to the displeasing sensory and affective experience caused by real or potential body injuries (Merskey,\u00a0 ), whereas social pain refers to the painful experience of social harm when social relationships are threatened, damaged or lost, such as social exclusion (Eisenberger & Lieberman,\u00a0 ; Rotge et al.,\u00a0 ). Despite the linguistic overlap and mutual relationship between monetary loss and pain, one problem we remained unclear about was whether the processing of monetary loss and pain engaged overlapping neural bases. \n\nPrevious studies have detected neural activity related to monetary loss. The receipt of monetary loss activates a broad range of brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), inferior frontal gyrus, medial frontal cortex, insula, cuneus, lingual gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus (Garc\u00eda, Filbey, Dunlop, & Myers,\u00a0 ; Kocsel et al.,\u00a0 ,  ; Lauwereyns, Bjork, Smith, Chen, & Hommer,\u00a0 ; Luo et al.,\u00a0 ; Ubl et al.,\u00a0 ; Yan et al.,\u00a0 ; Yu, Duan, Wu, & Luo,\u00a0 ; Yu, Wu, Huang, & Luo,\u00a0 ). Moreover, a meta\u2010analysis of monetary loss found that the outcome of monetary loss consistently activated the striatum and anterior cingulate gyri (Dugr\u00e9, Dumais, Bitar, & Potvin,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe neurocognitive network underlying physical pain and social pain were similar to those underlying monetary loss. The processing of physical pain involves a specific brain network referred to as the \u201cpain matrix,\u201d including the sensory\u2010discriminative system and cognitive\u2010affective system (Wager et al.,\u00a0 ; Wiech,\u00a0 ). The sensory\u2010discriminative system is responsible for recognizing the intensity, location, and quality of nociceptive stimuli and this system includes the lateral thalamus, posterior insula, and primary and secondary somatosensory cortex. The cognitive\u2010affective system is responsible for processing the psychological characteristics of physical pain, and this system includes the anterior insula (AI) and ACC. Regarding social pain, previous studies have found that social pain activates the insula, ACC, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (Cristofori, Harquel, Isnard, Mauguiere, & Sirigu,\u00a0 ; Eisenberger & Lieberman,\u00a0 ; Luo et al.,\u00a0 ; Luo et al.,\u00a0 ; Luo, Shi, Yang, Wang, & Han,\u00a0 ). Moreover, the activity of the ACC and AI positively correlate with self\u2010reported distress (DeWall et al.,\u00a0 ; Eisenberger, Lieberman, & Williams,\u00a0 ; Luo et al.,\u00a0 ; Luo, Yu, & Han,\u00a0 ; Luo & Zhang,\u00a0 ,  ; Luo, Zhu, Kong, & Xu,\u00a0 ; Masten et al.,\u00a0 ). Therefore, monetary loss and pain, including physical pain and social pain, may recruit a common neural substrate, such as insula and ACC. \n\nIn this study, we first conducted a neuroimaging meta\u2010analysis to investigate the overlapping neural bases of monetary loss and pain, including physical pain and social pain, with the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) technique (Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ; Eickhoff, Bzdok, Laird, Kurth, & Fox,\u00a0 ). Furthermore, if the processing of monetary loss and pain, including social pain and physical pain, engaged overlapping brain regions, we wanted to further explore which type of pain exhibited a more similar neural representation to monetary loss by representational similarity analysis (RSA; Huang, Yu, Long, Huang, & Luo,\u00a0 ; Peng & Luo,\u00a0 ; Yuan, Long, Huang, Huang, & Luo,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Literature search \n  \nFor each domain, we searched relevant articles in Google Scholar on December 27, 2019, and supplemented the included literature by searching articles in PubMed on November 16, 2021. For monetary loss, we used the terms fMRI AND (\u201cmonetary loss\u201d OR \u201close money\u201d OR \u201clost money\u201d OR \u201closes money\u201d OR \u201cmoney loss\u201d OR \u201cfinancial loss\u201d) and identified 4012 studies. For physical pain, we used the terms fMRI AND pain AND (\u201celectric stimuli\u201d OR \u201cthermal stimuli\u201d OR \u201cmechanical stimuli\u201d OR \u201cpressure stimuli\u201d) AND participants and identified 4,514 studies. For social pain, we used the terms fMRI AND pain AND (\u201csocial pain\u201d OR \u201csocial rejection\u201d OR \u201csocial exclusion\u201d OR \u201csocial ostracism\u201d) and identified 8,103 studies. \n\n\n### Sample selection \n  \nWe screened all the studies according to the following criteria (Figure\u00a0 ): (a) only FMRI studies; (b) only studies that contained whole\u2010brain activation coordinates; (c) only studies whose activation coordinates were represented in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space or Talairach (TAL) space; (d) only studies involving normal participants; (e) only original English studies published in a peer\u2010reviewed journal; (f) only studies without priming or drug administration, since the drug or priming may affect the sensitivity of loss and pain (Bradley et al.,\u00a0 ; Urtado Silva, Galhardoni, Ciampi de Andrade, & Brito,\u00a0 ); and (e) other special criteria. For monetary loss, only studies containing the outcome phase of monetary loss were included, since loss anticipation and outcome may activate distinct brain regions (Dugr\u00e9 et al.,\u00a0 ). For physical pain, only studies including experimental pain rather than chronic pain were included. Additionally, we explored the brain areas consistently activated across different nociceptive stimuli, and we did not restrict the type of painful stimuli. For social pain, we only included studies involving a direct experience of social pain. Three researchers screened all relevant studies and reached a consensus on these inclusion criteria. \n  \nThe flowchart of the sample selection process \n  \n\n###  ALE   procedure \n  \nWe conducted the meta\u2010analysis with the ALE method using the GingerALE software package (Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ,  ; Eickhoff, Laird, Fox, Lancaster, & Fox,\u00a0 ). \n\n#### Independent meta\u2010analysis \n  \nWe first performed an individual meta\u2010analysis of each domain to examine the most concurrent brain regions in each domain. Only coordinates with positive activations were included in our analyses. Additionally, we excluded those activation coordinates detected by a more liberal threshold than the threshold used for the rest of the brain. We first used GingerALE software to convert all the TAL coordinates into MNI coordinates (Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ). Then, we used a three\u2010dimensional Gaussian probability distribution to represent the spatial uncertainty of each activation coordinate, in which the value of each voxel was the probability that the activation coordinate was located in this voxel. In each study, for each voxel, we calculated the probability that at least one activation coordinate was located in this voxel, which was called the model activation (MA) value representing the probability of activation of this voxel in this study. Then, we obtained an MA map for each study. Through the integration of all the MA maps, we calculated the ALE value for each voxel, representing the probability that at least one activation coordinate was located in this voxel when considering all relevant papers. Finally, we conducted a permutation test to examine whether these MA maps overlapped. We randomly selected an activation coordinate and its corresponding MA value for each MA map and then calculated an ALE value based on these MA values. After repeating these steps several times, we constructed the null distribution based on the obtained ALE values and calculated the   p  \u2010value for each voxel. We applied cluster\u2010level family\u2010wise error correction and used   p   < .001 as the cluster\u2010forming threshold and   p   < .05 for cluster\u2010level inference to identify the significantly activated brain regions and correct for false\u2010positive inflation resulting from multiple comparisons (Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n#### Conjunction and contrast analysis \n  \nBefore conducting the conjunction and contrast analysis, we first merged all the original activation coordinates for each domain pair (monetary loss\u2013physical pain; monetary loss\u2013social pain) and conducted an individual meta\u2010analysis based on these pooled coordinates. \n\nWe conducted a conjunction analysis by taking the voxelwise minimum ALE value of those two thresholded individual meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived networks to determine the overlapping brain regions for each domain pair. \n\nWe also conducted a contrast analysis for each domain pair to determine the distinct brain regions. For each domain pair, we first pooled all the original activation coordinates of those two meta\u2010analysis networks and randomly split them into two groups (Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ). We calculated the voxelwise ALE values for each group and computed the difference in the ALE values between those two groups for each voxel. After iterating these steps 10,000 times, we produced a null distribution and calculated the   p  \u2010value for each voxel (Laird et al.,\u00a0 ). Finally, we applied an uncorrected threshold of   p   < .01 with a minimum cluster size of 200\u2009mm  to correct for false\u2010positive inflation resulting from multiple comparisons. The results of contrast analyses are provided in the  . \n\n\n\n### Similarity analysis \n  \nTo further analyze the similarity in neural representations between each domain pair (monetary loss\u2013physical pain; monetary\u2013social pain), according to Schurz et al.\u00a0( ), we conducted similarity analyses based on the meta\u2010analytical results at a less conservative statistical threshold of   p   < .005 uncorrected with a minimum cluster size of 200\u2009mm . \n\nFor each meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network, we categorized all the significantly activated voxels based on the 17\u2010network parcellation template reported by Yeo et al.\u00a0( ). We calculated the percentage of the significant voxels located in each subnetwork among all the voxels significantly activated by that domain, which consisted of the distribution vector. For each network pair, the Spearman correlation coefficient and the Euclidean distance between their corresponding distribution vectors were calculated as indices of their similarity in neural representations. \n\nAdditionally, we conducted a, RSA based on the representational similarity between those 17 subnetworks within each meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network. For each domain, we used the following formula to calculate the similarity of each pairwise subnetwork: where   represents the similarity of subnetworks   m   and   n  , and   and   represent the percentages of the significant voxels located in subnetworks   m   and   n   among all the voxels significantly activated by that domain, respectively. Then, we acquired a similarity matrix for each meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network, in which the value of each cell was defined as the similarity of each corresponding pairwise subnetwork. For each domain pair, we calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient between their corresponding similarity matrices and tested it using the Mantel permutation test (Mantel,\u00a0 ), which was a one\u2010tailed test. The null hypothesis was that the Spearman correlation coefficient between two similarity matrices was \u22640. We randomly shuffled the rows and columns of one similarity matrix to construct a new similarity matrix and then calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient between this new similarity matrix and the remaining similarity matrix. After repeating these steps many times, we constructed a null distribution and calculated a   p  \u2010value for the observed Spearman correlation coefficient. \n\n\n### Meta\u2010analytical functional decoding \n  \nWe decoded the functional characteristics of the meta\u2010analysis network of each domain using the Neurosynth Image Decoder. This platform calculates the similarity between any meta\u2010analysis network and other meta\u2010analytical maps related to certain terms by computing Pearson's correlation coefficients across all voxels (Bellucci, Molter, & Park,\u00a0 ). For each domain, we selected four relevant meta\u2010analytical activation maps (monetary loss domain: stop signal, choices, reward, and error; physical pain domain: somatosensory, sensation, nociceptive, and stimulation; and social pain domain: affective, social, emotional, and mood). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Individual meta\u2010analysis \n  \nFor monetary loss, one study was excluded from the final ALE meta\u2010analysis because it reported no significant activation coordinates. The monetary loss dataset (Table\u00a0 ) consisted of 469 participants and 20 studies containing 20 experiments and 151 foci. The ALE meta\u2010analysis of all foci (Figure\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ) revealed four significant clusters, involving the right AI (extending to the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus), left AI (extending to the inferior frontal gyrus), anterior cingulate, and lingual gyrus (extending to the inferior occipital gyrus). \n  \nOverview of significant clusters identified in the individual meta\u2010analyses and conjunction analysis.

ALE meta\u2010analyses of all foci revealed eight significant clusters (Figure\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ), involving the right AI (extending to the precentral gyrus and lentiform nucleus), left posterior insula (extending to the inferior parietal lobule and postcentral gyrus), anterior cingulate, thalamus (extending to the caudate), postcentral gyrus (extending to the supramarginal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule), right posterior insula, and claustrum. \n\nThe social pain dataset (Table\u00a0 ) comprised 1,201 participants and 32 studies including 34 experiments and 376 foci. ALE meta\u2010analyses of all foci revealed four significant clusters (Figure\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ), involving the left AI (extending to the inferior frontal gyrus), anterior cingulate gyrus, and lingual gyrus. \n\n\n### Conjunction analysis \n  \nThe conjunction analysis between physical pain and monetary loss (Figure\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ) revealed two significant clusters, which were located in the right AI and dorsal anterior cingulate. The conjunction analysis between social pain and monetary loss (Figure\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ) revealed three significant clusters involving the left AI (extending to the inferior frontal gyrus), inferior occipital gyrus, and lingual gyrus. \n  \nSignificant clusters revealed by the conjunction analysis \n    \n\n### Similarity analysis \n  \nFor each meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network, we calculated the percentage of the significant voxels located in each subnetwork among all the voxels significantly activated by that domain (Figure\u00a0 ). The monetary loss meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network was mainly located within the visual peripheral, limbic, and default A network; the physical pain meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network was mainly located within the control A, default C, and default A networks; and the social pain meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network was mainly located within the limbic and visual peripheral networks. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the distribution vectors of monetary loss and social pain was marginally significant (Spearman's   \u03c1   = .44,   p   = .079), while the Spearman correlation coefficient between the distribution vectors of monetary loss and physical pain was insignificant (Spearman's   \u03c1   = \u2212.01,   p   = .959). Consistently, the distribution vector of monetary loss was closer to the distribution vector of social pain than to physical pain (the Euclidean distance between monetary loss and social pain: .19; the Euclidean distance between monetary loss and physical pain: .46). \n  \nResults of the similarity analysis.

Monetary loss shared more similar neural representations with social pain than physical pain (the Spearman correlation coefficient between the similarity matrices of monetary loss and social pain: Spearman's   \u03c1   = .51,   p   = .002; the Spearman correlation coefficient between the similarity matrices of monetary loss and physical pain: Spearman's   \u03c1   = .02,   p   = .378). \n\nAll these results suggested that the neural representation of monetary loss was more similar to social pain than to physical pain. \n\n\n### Meta\u2010analytical functional decoding \n  \nAs shown in Figure\u00a0 , the meta\u2010analysis network of each domain was more closely related to the functional roles in the corresponding domain relative to the other domains. Moreover, the monetary loss meta\u2010analysis network was more closely related to the functional roles in the social pain domain than the physical pain domain, confirming the hypothesis that the monetary loss meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network was more similar to the social pain meta\u2010analysis network than to the physical pain meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network. \n  \nResults of meta\u2010analytical functional decoding \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nCurrent research has shown that monetary loss shares common neural bases with pain. We found that monetary loss and pain, whether physical pain or social pain, engaged overlapping neural regions. Although monetary loss and physical pain coactivated the right AI and dorsal anterior cingulate, monetary loss and social pain coactivated the left AI, inferior occipital gyrus, and lingual gyrus. Furthermore, the neural representation of monetary loss was more similar to social pain than to physical pain. All these results provided persuasive evidence of common neural correlates of monetary loss and pain. \n\nRegardless of the type of pain experienced, activation of the AI was a shared neural representation of monetary loss and pain. The AI is a multifunctional brain region that is involved in various cognitive, perceptual, and socio\u2010affective processes (Clos, Rottschy, Laird, Fox, & Eickhoff,\u00a0 ; Kurth, Zilles, Fox, Laird, & Eickhoff,\u00a0 ). In particular, activation of the insula plays an important role in affective processing (Koelsch, Cheung, Jentschke, & Haynes,\u00a0 ). Therefore, coactivation of the AI might reflect that monetary loss and pain engaged an overlapping neural module of affective processing. Moreover, monetary loss and physical pain coactivated the right AI, whereas monetary loss and social pain coactivated the left AI. This result was consistent with previous findings that the AI was right\u2010lateralized in connectivity with the postcentral gyrus and superior parietal lobule, which were part of the physical pain network (Kann, Zhang, Manza, Leung, & Li,\u00a0 ), whereas the left AI was part of memory and socioemotional networks (Clos et al.,\u00a0 ), and the activation of the left AI was associated with maintaining the feelings of others in working memory (Smith et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe comparison of activation patterns used three algorithms and consistently showed that the monetary loss network was more similar to the social pain network than to the physical pain network. For individuals, money is not only a physical stimulus but also has rich emotional and social meanings to people, since money can arouse positive or negative emotions (Tang,\u00a0 ; Yu, Huang, Mao, & Luo,\u00a0 ), elicit individuals\u2019 internal motivation (Lea & Webley,\u00a0 ), reduce the harm caused by low self\u2010esteem (Zhang,\u00a0 ) and change the norms of interpersonal relationships (Vohs et al.,\u00a0 ; Zaleskiewicz & Gasiorowska,\u00a0 ). Moreover, this result provided neural evidence of the social resource theory of money, in which money was regarded as a type of social resource, similar to social relationships, which might elicit pain and a sense of security (Zhou et al.,\u00a0 ; Zhou & Gao,\u00a0 ). \n\nWe admitted that our research had several limitations. For one thing, results of similar analyses may be due to higher similarities in sensory system between monetary loss and social pain compared to physical pain. The reason was that the sensory system of physical pain was the somatomotor system while the sensory system of both monetary loss and social pain was the visual system. However, we excluded this possibility by replicating the similarity analyses without including the somatomotor and visual networks. We got similar results to the previous ones (Figures\u00a0  and  ), suggesting that the neural representation of monetary loss shared more similarities with that of social pain beyond the level of sensory system. For another thing, our research investigated the shared neural bases underlying monetary loss and pain by exploring whether processing these two events involved overlapping neural regions while ignoring the possibility of the involvement of overlapping functional connectivities. Previous studies have reported that the processing of social stimuli and monetary stimuli recruits overlapping functional connectivities by investigating the relationship between social reward and monetary reward (Gu et al.,\u00a0 ). However, we remained unclear whether the processing of monetary loss and social pain also involved overlapping functional connectivities. Future studies could use meta\u2010analytic connectivity modeling to investigate the neural correlates of monetary loss and social pain from the perspective of functional connectivity. \n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nIn conclusion, our research revealed the shared neural bases underlying monetary loss and pain. We showed that the processing of monetary loss and pain engaged overlapping neural regions by conducting an ALE neuroimaging meta\u2010analysis. Regardless of the type of pain experienced, activation of the AI was a shared neural representation of monetary loss and pain. Moreover, the neural representation of monetary loss was more similar to that of social pain than to that of physical pain. Therefore, our research provided persuasive neural evidence for the shared neural bases between monetary loss and pain. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \n Designed the research  : Huixin Tan, Yihan Liu, Xinyu Qiao, and Siyang Luo.

Intra-subject variability in the location of the fROI violates this assumption, reducing the sensitivity of the analysis and biasing the results. Here we investigated consistency and variability in fROIs in a set of 45 volunteers. They performed two functional localiser scans to identify word- and object-sensitive regions of ventral and lateral occipito-temporal cortex, respectively. In the main analyses, fROIs were defined as the category-selective voxels in each region and consistency was measured as the spatial overlap between scans. Consistency was greatest when minimally selective thresholds were used to define \u201cactive\u201d voxels (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 uncorrected), revealing that approximately 65% of the voxels were commonly activated by both scans. In contrast, highly selective thresholds (  p  \u00a0<\u00a010  to 10 ) yielded the lowest consistency values with less than 25% overlap of the voxels active in both scans. In other words, intra-subject variability was surprisingly high, with between one third and three quarters of the voxels in a given fROI not corresponding to those activated in the main task. This level of variability stands in striking contrast to the consistency seen in retinotopically-defined areas and has important implications for designing robust but efficient functional localiser scans. \n \n\n# Body\n \n \n In choosing a localizer to define an ROI, the researcher is making an ontological assumption that this localizer contrast picks out a meaningful functional unit in the brain (i.e., a natural kind). Like other ontological assumptions in science, the utility of a particular functionally defined ROI is determined by the consistency of the data that emerge from it and the richness of the theoretical progress those data support.  , 91\u201392. \n \n\n## Introduction \n  \nIncreasingly, functional neuroimaging studies are moving away from traditional brain mapping studies designed to identify the cortical topography of a function (\u03a8) and towards designs that investigate the response properties of specific neuroanatomical regions. This approach requires a robust method for identifying the region under investigation, however, macro-anatomic landmarks are not especially good predictors of functionally homogenous cortical fields ( ). The early visual fields are a good example. V1 is primarily located in the calcarine sulcus but its borders do not correspond to clear sulcal landmarks while V2 and V3 are even more difficult to distinguish based purely on local landmarks ( ). The inability to define a region unambiguously is a major impediment to investigating it. Consequently, a typical solution is to localise the region functionally based on its response properties, for instance, using retinotopy ( ), somatotopy ( ), or tonotopy ( ). Even higher order association areas can be defined in this way with \u201cfunctional localisers\u201d routinely used to identify the set of voxels sensitive to faces ( ), speech ( ), objects ( ), body parts ( ), scenes ( ), or written words ( ). In most cases this involves collecting additional scans in which participants perform a different task solely for the purpose of functionally identifying the anatomical region and then using it in summary mode as a way of evaluating the response profile of a functionally defined region-of-interest (fROI). \n\nAlthough there is some debate regarding the most efficient method for doing this ( ), relatively little attention is paid to the validity of a key underlying assumption \u2014 namely, how consistent are the localisations? Obviously the tacit assumption is that the same task in the same subject will identify essentially the same set of voxels despite various sources of physiological and scanner noise ( ). If there is considerable variability between runs within the same session, then the basic idea of functional localisation becomes suspect because the localised set of voxels may not correspond well to those being tested in the main experimental run, decreasing sensitivity and increasing both false positives and false negatives. \n\nOne of the few studies to investigate this issue examined the consistency of activation for faces in the fusiform and occipital face areas (FFA and OFA), scenes in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), and body parts in the extrastriate body area (EBA) ( ). They found all stimuli produced peak voxels that were consistent in both location and   t  -value across runs. They did not, however, report the consistency of the activation itself, which is important because most studies that use functional data to identify a region-of-interest define it based on the cluster of voxels within a given anatomical area activated by a particular contrast ( ). One study which did investigate the consistency of activation for faces found that although the location of the peak voxel was stable, there was less than 40% overlap  in the number of active voxels between localiser runs ( ), suggesting that functionally defined ROIs may be more variable than commonly assumed. \n\nHere we had the opportunity to evaluate consistency and variability associated with functionally localising reading- and object-sensitive areas of left occipito-temporal cortex (OTC). As part of an on-going series of TMS studies, we used fMRI to localise a region of the ventral OTC associated with visual word recognition ( ) and a lateral OTC region associated with visual object recognition ( ) in a fairly large sample of volunteers (  n  \u00a0=\u00a045). To empirically evaluate the assumption that functional localisation of category-sensitive cortical regions is robust and consistent, we calculated three different measures of consistency between two functional localiser runs: (1) the distance between peak voxels in the two runs; (2) the amount of spatial overlap in activations and (3) the amount of overlap in contiguously activated voxels within a spherical ROI centred on the peak voxel. The results illustrate considerable within-subject variability in the localisation of the two fROIs and call into question the validity of a key assumption underlying typical functional localiser scans. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \n45 (23 M, 22 F) healthy, monolingual English speakers participated in an fMRI study as part of a neuro-navigated TMS study ( ). Their ages ranged from 19 to 38 (mean\u00a0=\u00a025), and all were right handed with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. None had a personal or family history of any neurological disease, and each gave informed consent after the experimental procedures were explained. This experiment was approved by the Berkshire NHS Research Ethics Committee. \n\n\n### Experimental paradigm \n  \nIn order to investigate intra- and inter-subject consistency for reading and object sensitivity in ventral and lateral OTC respectively, a one-back task was used with four categories of visual stimuli: written words, pictures of common objects, scrambled pictures of the same objects, and consonant letter strings ( ). Subjects were instructed to press a button if the stimulus was identical to the preceding stimulus and 12.5% of the stimuli were targets. A block design was used to maximize statistical sensitivity. Each block consisted of 16 trials from a single category presented one every second. A trial began with a 650\u00a0ms fixation cross, followed by the stimulus for 350\u00a0ms. In between blocks, subjects viewed a fixation cross for 16\u00a0s. The stimuli were divided equally into two lists, with the order counter-balanced across subjects such that 50% of subjects saw the first list of stimuli during run 1 and the remaining 50% during run 2. In total there were 192 stimuli per category including targets. Using a one-back task has the advantage that stimulus category can be varied without changing the task, maintaining a constant cognitive set \u2014 the specific stimuli are almost incidental to the task. In addition, it is commonly used for functional localisation ( ). \n\nWord stimuli (  n  \u00a0=\u00a0168) were obtained from the MRC psycholinguistic database ( ) and consisted of 4 or 5 letter words with regular spellings (e.g. \u201chope\u201d). All words had familiarity ratings between 300 and 500 ( ), were either one or two syllables, and had a British English written word frequency value of 40 or less ( ). The stimuli in the two runs were fully matched for frequency, familiarity, imageability, number of letters, and number of syllables. Object stimuli consisted of black and white pictures (200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0250\u00a0pixels) of easily recognizable objects such as a boat, tent, nail, etc. The scrambled objects were generated by dividing the pictures into 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0pixel squares and permuting their placement within the image. None of the resulting images were recognizable after scrambling. Finally, consonant letter strings were unpronounceable strings randomly generated to exactly match the length of the word stimuli. \n\n\n### Functional imaging \n  \nWhole-brain imaging was performed on a Siemens 1.5\u00a0T MR scanner at the Birkbeck-UCL Neuroimaging (BUCNI) Centre in London. The functional data were acquired with a gradient-echo EPI sequence (TR\u00a0=\u00a03000\u00a0ms; TE\u00a0=\u00a050\u00a0ms; FOV\u00a0=\u00a0192\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0192; matrix\u00a0=\u00a064\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064) giving a notional resolution of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm. Each run consisted of 164 volumes and as a result, the two runs together took 16.4\u00a0min. In addition, a high-resolution anatomical scan was acquired (T1-weighted FLASH, TR\u00a0=\u00a012\u00a0ms; TE\u00a0=\u00a05.6\u00a0ms; 1\u00a0mm  resolution) for anatomically localising activations in individuals. \n\nData processing was carried out using FSL 4.0 ( ). To allow for T1 equilibrium, the initial two images of each run were discarded. The data were then realigned to remove small head movements ( ), smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 6\u00a0mm, and pre-whitened to remove temporal auto-correlation ( ). The resulting images were entered into a general linear model with four conditions of interest corresponding to the four categories of visual stimuli. Blocks were convolved with a double gamma \u201ccanonical\u201d hemodynamic response function ( ) to generate the main regressors. In addition, the estimated motion parameters were entered as covariates of no interest to reduce structured noise due to minor head motion. Linear contrasts of [words\u00a0>\u00a0fixation] and [objects\u00a0>\u00a0scrambled objects] identified reading- and object-sensitive areas, respectively. First level results were registered to the MNI-152 template using a 12-DOF affine transformation ( ) and all subsequent analyses were conducted in the MNI standard space. A second level fixed-effects model combined the two first level runs into a single, subject-specific analysis which was then entered into a third level, mixed effects analysis to draw inferences at the population level ( ). \n\nNote that consonant strings were originally intended to serve as a baseline condition for words analogous to scrambled pictures for objects. Although the contrast [words\u00a0>\u00a0consonants] produced activation in vOTC at the random effects level similar to previous studies ( ), the activation was not reliable for individuals (see also  ) and therefore [words\u00a0>\u00a0rest] was used to identify reading-sensitive areas instead. \n\n\n### Regions-of-interest \n  \nIn order to restrict the analyses to the ventral and lateral OTC, two anatomical masks were drawn in standard space. The ventral OTC mask encompassed the posterior portion of the left fusiform gyrus, occipito-temporal sulcus (OTS), and medial parts of the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) \u2014 areas consistently activated by visual word recognition tasks ( ). The standard space coordinates were:   X  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a030 to \u2212\u00a054,   Y  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a045 to \u2212\u00a070 and   Z  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a030 to \u2212\u00a04. This region is sometimes referred to as the \u201cvisual word form area\u201d ( ), although the term is misleading as it suggests a functional specificity which is not present ( ). The lateral OTC mask encompassed lateral posterior fusiform gyrus, posterior OTS and lateral parts of posterior ITG \u2014 areas consistently activated by visual objects and collectively known as the \u201clateral occipital complex\u201d ( ). The standard space coordinates were   X  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a033 to \u2212\u00a056,   Y  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a067 to \u2212\u00a089 and   Z  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a020 to +\u00a04. Within each mask, only voxels with at least a 20% chance of being grey matter were included based on an automatic tissue segmentation algorithm ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behaviour: 1-back performance \n  \nBehavioural data from six subjects were lost due to a problem recording button press responses while in the scanner. The data from the remaining subjects (  n  \u00a0=\u00a039) were analysed using signal detection theory as hits and false alarms. The mean hit rate was 0.791 and the false alarm rate was 0.011, indicating that participants performed the task adequately (see  ). In addition, d-prime (d') scores were calculated to measure sensitivity for detecting repeated items ( ). These were then entered into 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 repeated measures ANOVA examining the effects of Category (words, consonant strings, objects, scrambled objects) and Run (first, second). A main effect of Category (  F  (3,114)\u00a0=\u00a077.9,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.0001) indicated that detecting repetitions of scrambled objects was most difficult, but there was no difference between words or objects (  t  (38)\u00a0=\u00a00.05,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.961). Importantly, neither the main effect of Run (  F  (1,38)\u00a0=\u00a00.494,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.486) nor the Category\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Run interaction (  F  (3,114)\u00a0=\u00a01.665,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.179) was significant, indicating that participants' performance did not significantly change from the first to the second run. The same pattern was present in the reaction times to correct detections (i.e. \u201chits\u201d). Again, there was a main effect of Category (  F  (3,114)\u00a0=\u00a05.4,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.002) but no main effect of Run (  F  (1,38)\u00a0=\u00a00.09,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.765) and no Category\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Run interaction (  F  (3,114)\u00a0=\u00a01.169,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.325). In other words, there was no behavioural evidence for task learning that might confound the activation patterns across runs. \n\n\n\n## Imaging results \n  \n### Group effects \n  \nConsistent with previous research, the peak activation in ventral OTC for words relative to fixation was located in the occipito-temporal sulcus (\u2212\u00a042, \u2212\u00a050, \u2212\u00a020;   Z  \u00a0=\u00a07.7), extending both medially onto the convexity of the posterior fusiform gyrus and laterally onto the inferior temporal gyrus. To visualize this activation, the group results were projected onto an inflated surface of an \u201caverage\u201d brain (i.e. Freesurfer's fsaverage subject) to illustrate that activation was not limited to the ventral surface but also present inside the occipito-temporal sulcus ( B). As reported previously ( ), objects relative to scrambled objects also activated this same region (\u2212\u00a040, \u2212\u00a058, \u2212\u00a020;   Z  \u00a0=\u00a07.9;  D) and although activation for objects was numerically larger than for words, there was no significant difference between them. Within the lateral OTC, objects produced strong activation in LOC (\u2212\u00a041, \u2212\u00a078, \u2212\u00a09;   Z  \u00a0=\u00a07.5), although once again, there was a comparable activation for words (\u2212\u00a037, \u2212\u00a084, \u2212\u00a011;   Z  \u00a0=\u00a06.9;  B). Here, objects did lead to significantly greater activation than words (  Z  \u00a0=\u00a05.9;  D), but this was part of a much larger cluster encompassing almost the entire occipital lobe and extending ventrally through large parts of the inferior temporal lobe bilaterally (c.f.  ). In other words, the group results demonstrate that the task and stimuli were appropriately able to identify ventral and lateral OTC areas and confirm previous studies that demonstrate greater activation for objects than words in OTC regions ( ). \n\n\n### Inter-subject variability \n  \nTo assess how closely activation from individuals matched the group results, their peak responses for words and objects were compared to the group results. For words, all 45 participants showed a peak response within ventral OTC with a   Z  -score of at least 3.5, although the specific location varied considerably ( ). The left panel of  C illustrates the spatial distribution of peaks within ventral OTC. Individual subject peaks are shown as orange dots. Each peak has been projected onto a single brain that has been inflated to show not only the crests of the gyri (light grey) but also the depths of the sulci (dark grey) using Freesurfer ( ). Note that the sharp demarcations between gyri and sulci do not accurately reflect the anatomical variability present in the group; instead the figure illustrates the spatial distribution of peaks relative to a single \u201caverage\u201d brain. Consequently, the specific anatomical location of each peak was assessed relative to that individual's structural scan in standard space. The greatest consistency is in the medial-lateral direction, with the majority of peaks (  n  \u00a0=\u00a020) falling within the occipito-temporal sulcus. Another 18 were located on the crest of the posterior fusiform gyrus and 7 were in on the crest of the inferior temporal gyrus. In contrast, the largest variation was in the rostro-caudal direction while the variation in   z  -axis is mostly due to the depth of the OTS. On average, the Euclidean distance from an individual subject's peak to the group peak was 15\u00a0mm (\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0mm). \n\nThere was slightly less variability in the peak coordinates for objects within lateral OTC. Once again, all 45 participants showed a clear peak in the ROI with   Z  -scores of 2.7 or higher and these are illustrated in the right panel of  C. The majority of peaks for objects lay in lateral occipital cortex (  n  \u00a0=\u00a026) and the remaining ones were located in posterior fusiform cortex (  n  \u00a0=\u00a019). Unlike the reading peaks, these were spread more evenly around group peak and on average, the Euclidean distance from an individual subject's peak to the group peak was 9\u00a0mm (\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0mm). \n\n\n### Intra-subject variability \n  \nThe most critical analyses for evaluating the consistency assumption underlying functional localisers concerned within-subject consistency. This was calculated in three ways. Because studies often define functional ROIs using a sphere with a fixed radius centred on the peak voxel ( ), the first measure examined the spatial reliability of the peak voxel since this determines the fROI. The coordinates of peak voxels were extracted for each participant from both runs and the distance between peaks was calculated using the standard Euclidean distance measurement. On average, peaks for words were separated by 7.4\u00a0mm while peaks for objects were 8.3\u00a0mm apart. It is worth noting that at the resolution of the acquired data (3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm), these peaks would be 2\u20133 voxels apart in space, although this figure varied considerably across participants. A number of subjects showed peaks within 1 voxel of each other (words:   n  \u00a0=\u00a017; objects:   n  \u00a0=\u00a011) however many subjects had peaks more than 4 voxels (>\u00a012\u00a0mm) apart (words:   n  \u00a0=\u00a012; objects:   n  \u00a0=\u00a012). The coordinates of the peak depend on many factors, however, and only one is the size of the underlying neurophysiological response. Therefore, peak locations are highly susceptible to random fluctuations ( ). Consequently, the second analysis focused on the set of voxels within the ROI that were activated by both runs. \n\nThe most common method for defining an fROI is based on the volume of activated voxels within a particular region ( ). Consequently, the second measure assessed consistency in terms of the volume of commonly activated cortex between runs in both ventral and lateral OTC. This was computed as the ratio (  R  ) of commonly activated voxels to the total number of activated voxels in two runs, i and j: where   V   is the number of voxels within the ROI which were active in both runs i and j; and   V   and   V   are the number of voxels within the ROI that were active in runs i and j, respectively. A value of 1.0 indicates identical sets of voxels while 0.0 represents completely disjoint sets. This definition, however, treats voxels as \u201cactive\u201d or not based on an essentially arbitrary threshold. To avoid conditioning the results by an arbitrary choice, five thresholds were used spanning a typical range: i)   Z  \u00a0>\u00a01.64 (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 uncorrected), ii)   Z  \u00a0>\u00a02.3 (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.01 uncorrected) iii)   Z  \u00a0>\u00a03.09 (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected), and iv)   Z  \u00a0>\u00a04.0, (roughly   p  \u00a0<\u00a010 , which is fairly conservative) and v)   Z  \u00a0>\u00a05.0 (roughly   p  \u00a0<\u00a010 , which would conservatively correct for multiple comparisons across the whole brain with a family-wise \u03b1\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Mean (\u00b1\u00a0SEM) consistency ratios were similar in both ventral and lateral OTC regions with the highest values (0.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 and 0.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04) for the lowest statistical threshold ( A). Raising the statistical threshold   decreased   the amount of overlap between runs, and this is illustrated in  . In this figure, data from two representative subjects show how the increasingly conservative statistical threshold influences the overlap (yellow) between runs (shown in red and green). At lenient thresholds, there is widespread activation within both the ventral and lateral occipito-temporal ROIs, leading to considerable overlap (the consistency score is shown in the upper right corner of the panel). At higher thresholds, however, two things typically happened. First, the number of active voxels in one or both runs decreased dramatically, reducing the overlap between runs. Second, the active clusters from the two runs tended to separate spatially, leaving only a small region of common activation. At the two most conservative statistical thresholds (  Z  \u00a0>\u00a04.0 and   Z  \u00a0>\u00a05.0) the mean consistency scores were 0.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05 and 0.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05, respectively. In addition, higher thresholds meant fewer subjects with significantly activated voxels. For instance, at the most conservative threshold it was impossible to identify an fROI for words or objects in 8 and 18 (out of 45) participants, respectively. In sum, overlap scores were surprisingly low with more conservative statistical thresholds yielding even less overlap and fewer subjects in which an fROI could be defined. \n\nFinally, it is possible to combine peak and volume measures to define an fROI as the set of active voxels that are contiguous with the peak activation ( ). This approach will help to reduce variability between runs as long as the two peaks fall within overlapping clusters. To assess the consistency of this method, we defined fROIs as the set of contiguous active voxels (using the same set of five thresholds as above) that included the peak voxel and were within a 9\u00a0mm radius of the peak voxel following  . The results are shown in  B. Again, the highest consistency values were for the lowest statistical threshold. For the contrast [words\u00a0>\u00a0fixation] in ventral OTC, the mean consistency ratio (  R  ) was 0.50 (SEM\u00a0=\u00a00.05) and for the contrast [objects\u00a0>\u00a0scrambled], the mean   R   was 0.45 (SEM\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Increasing the threshold to   Z  \u00a0>\u00a05 reduced the overlap to 0.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05 for words and 0.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 for objects and precluded identifying an fROI in 8 and 18 of the participants. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the consistency associated with functionally localising reading- and object-sensitive areas of left occipito-temporal cortex. At the group level, the current results closely match previous reports with peak activations located in the posterior occipito-temporal sulcus for written words ( ) and in the lateral occipital region for visual objects ( ). In other words, the ability to localise these regions at the group level is highly consistent across studies. At the individual level, however, localization was considerably less consistent, with peaks varying in location by as much as 20\u00a0mm in any direction. This finding replicates previous studies and demonstrates the importance of using functional data to localise a specific region-of-interest when characterizing its response properties ( ). But in order for functional localisation to be meaningful, it must be robust and consistent   within   subjects. The current findings suggest that this consistency was surprisingly poor, regardless of the specific method used to evaluate consistency:   \n Peak voxels  . Roughly 33% of our participants had peaks at essentially the same location in both localiser runs whereas another 27% had peaks that were at least 12\u00a0mm apart. The remainder fell within those two extremes. In other words, for one quarter of the subjects tested here, an fROI based on the peak voxel response may not even overlap with the activation seen in the main experimental task. \n  \n Spatial overlap  . The most commonly used method for defining an fROI is to select the voxels within a region activated by a given contrast. Clearly this depends critically on the definition of \u201cactive voxels\u201d and this varies from study to study. Over a wide range of activation thresholds (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 to   p  \u00a0<\u00a010 ), consistency scores were surprisingly low, ranging from 64% to 21%, respectively. The most lenient definition of \u201cactive\u201d voxels produced the greatest consistency across runs, but even so, roughly one third of the data from the fROI are coming from noisy or unreliable voxels. Equally problematic is the fact that lenient statistical thresholds lead to only minimal category-selectivity in the ROI ( ). Conservative statistical thresholds (  p  \u00a0<\u00a010  to 10 ) are more common but yield very low consistency values, with less than half of the voxels present in both runs. As a result, the majority of the data being investigated comes from unreliable voxels. \n  \n Peak plus spatial extent  . In theory, combining the first two methods has the advantage that small displacements of the peak voxel do not necessarily change the fROI, assuming they fall within a common cluster of active voxels. In practice, the results were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the previous method because of the small numbers of active voxels common to both runs. \n  \n\nOne potential explanation for the low levels of overlap between runs is that participants may acclimate to the task and therefore show less activation in their second run. There was, however, no evidence of task learning in the behavioural data. This was also true for the imaging data where we analysed the number of active voxels per contrast with Run (first, second) and Threshold (1.64, 2.33, 3.09, 4.0, 5.0) as independent factors. Predictably there was a main effect of Threshold on the number of active voxels for both contrasts (words:   F  (4, 179)\u00a0=\u00a0229.3,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001; objects:   F  (4, 179)\u00a0=\u00a0192.9,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001). but there was no main effect of Run (words:   F  (1,44)\u00a0<\u00a00.1,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.936; objects   F  (1,44)\u00a0=\u00a01.2,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.287) and no Run\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Threshold interaction (words:   F  (4,176)\u00a0=\u00a00.3,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.896; objects:   F  (4,176)\u00a0=\u00a00.8,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.520). In other words, task learning did not appear to significantly contribute to the relatively low consistency between runs. \n\nThe single largest source of variability appeared to be spatial shifts in activation (see  ), which help to explain the surprising finding that overlap decreased with more conservative statistical thresholding (see also  ). Initially, we assumed that higher statistical thresholds would converge on the most selective category-sensitive voxels which we expected would be stable across runs. In practice, however, the highest thresholds showed the lowest consistency scores resulting in a trade-off between category-selectiveness and consistency. One potential limitation of our study is that we only tested two types of category-selectivity and only in two anatomical areas, so it is possible that our results may not generalize to other areas. On the other hand, despite being sensitive to different categories of stimuli, both regions showed essentially the same pattern and this pattern matched those of   who found at best 50% consistency in face-sensitive areas. \n\nThis variability for category-sensitive visual areas stands in contrast to the consistency seen for retinotopically-defined visual areas, which appear remarkably stable within individuals (M. I. Sereno, personal communication). One striking difference between retinotopic vs. category-sensitive localisers is the amount of data typically collected. Studies of retinotopy often collect an order of magnitude more data (see  ). For instance, it is not uncommon to functionally localise category-sensitive regions based on one or more scans that take a total of 20\u00a0min or less. In contrast, retinotopy is typically defined using six to twelve scans that together take an hour or more, so perhaps it is not surprising that the results are more consistent. On other hand, it is possible that the observed variability in visual association areas accurately reflects functional-anatomic variability in these regions due to neuronal firing patterns becoming increasingly distant from the stimulus they are intended to represent. Either way, this issue has important implication for the design of functional localiser scans because it suggests that additional data will be necessary to maintain sensitivity and avoid experimental bias or it places absolute limits on the reliability of functional localisers. Clearly further work is necessary to resolve this question ( ). \n\nIn short, these findings call into question the reliability of functional localisers to identify a meaningful and consistent set of category-sensitive voxels. One of the prime motivations for using functional localisers is to maximize sensitivity by explicitly accounting for inter-subject variability in the location of a functionally defined region ( ). Our results suggest, however, that it is equally important to explicitly consider intra-subject variability when defining an fROI to avoid analyzing data from voxels that are not consistently present in the fROI. \n\n### Implications for TMS \n  \nFinally, our results also have important implications for TMS studies. There are several options when choosing a method for targeting stimulation, including using fMRI-based neuro-navigation, using standard space coordinates from published imaging studies, or using heuristic methods such as the 10\u201320 system. Recent empirical studies have shown that although all three methods work, the latter two are sub-optimal, requiring higher stimulation intensities and/or larger numbers of subjects ( ). This is almost certainly due to the considerable inter-subject variability in the location of peak responses (current results;  ) rendering stimulation based on group coordinates less efficient. This problem is further compounded by a heuristic approach to targeting because of the inherent variability between the measurement system (e.g. the 10\u201320 system) and the underlying anatomy ( ). Clearly, an optimal targeting method will take into account inter-subject variability either through neuro-navigated TMS ( ) or by localising the stimulation directly with TMS ( ). Our current results suggest that even neuro-navigated TMS is not an entirely reliable method due to the localisation variability within a single subject, particularly when coupled with spatial distortions in EPI images due to magnetic field inhomogeneities and draining veins ( ). Instead, a TMS-based functional localiser probably represents the optimal method for targeting stimulation as it avoids all of these sources of error and provides a direct measure of the effect of stimulation across a range of target sites. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nThe current findings demonstrate surprisingly low intra-subject consistency when functionally localising word- and object-sensitive regions of occipito-temporal cortex but also highlight considerations for designing and reporting studies using functional localisers. The most obvious is simply optimising data collection wherever possible. Collecting larger quantities of localiser data, reducing sources of variability ( ), and optimising both stimuli and tasks ( ) will all improve the consistency of the results. It is worth noting that the use of factorial designs, rather than separate localiser scans, will also improve consistency by using the same data to define the fROI as is used to interrogate the response profile of the region ( ). Finally, clearer reporting of the exact methods used to functionally localise a region would also assist readers in evaluating the robustness of the findings. At a minimum, these could include clear information about the amount of data collected as well as the details of how the fROI was defined. For instance, in many cases it is unclear what anatomical criteria (if any) are used to limit the extent of the fROI to the region under investigation. Functional localisers currently play an important role in cognitive neuroscience, and no doubt will become even more important in the future. Consequently, it will be increasingly important to optimise the practice to provide consistent localisation within individuals in order to maximize sensitivity and avoid potential sources of bias. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 2686646, "text_md5": "c05b4d50d535737182e84dbdbc4bef61", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 82], "journal": [83, 93], "publication_year": [95, 99], "title": [110, 162], "keywords": [176, 279], "abstract": [292, 1838], "body": [1847, 33458]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 19289173, "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.03.014", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2686646", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=2686646"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2686646\">2686646</a>", "list_title": "PMC2686646  Consistency and variability in functional localisers"}

This could be the effect of experience reducing sensitivity to others pain, or distrust toward patients\u2019 self-evaluations. Across multiple experiments (375 participants), we tested whether senior medical students differed from younger colleagues and lay controls in the way they assess people\u2019s pain and take into consideration their feedback. We found that medical training affected the sensitivity to pain faces, an effect shown by the lower ratings and highlighted by a decrease in neural response of the insula and cingulate cortex. Instead, distrust toward the expressions\u2019 authenticity affected the processing of feedbacks, by decreasing activity in the ventral striatum whenever patients\u2019 self-reports matched participants\u2019 evaluations, and by promoting strong reliance on the opinion of other doctors. Overall, our study underscores the multiple processes which might influence the evaluation of others\u2019 pain at the early stages of medical career. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nUnrelieved pain is a major medical problem worldwide, resulting in human suffering and economic costs. Unlike other medical conditions, which are diagnosed through reliable tests, pain is difficult to quantify objectively, and it is mainly assessed by medical practitioners (physicians, nurses, medical students, etc.) using indirect information or self-reports. As such, healthcare providers systematically underestimate patients\u2019 pain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), a phenomenon which emerges as early as during university ( ), becomes more pronounced with long-lasting experience in the field ( ;  ), and affects prevalently women ( ) and ethnical minorities ( ;  ;  ). \n\nDespite extensive research, the causes of pain underestimation are still unclear. A popular theory suggests a major role of medical experience. Indeed, due to their daily exposure to the severe conditions, often characterized by high levels of suffering, healthcare providers could have progressively changed their frame of reference of what characterizes an extreme pain ( ). Hence, they might be inclined to provide less intense evaluations than those individuals (e.g. the average patient) who do not share the same experience. Within this framework, neuroimaging literature repeatedly implicated brain regions, such as the anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in processing other people\u2019s pain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). As this network is partly common to that involved in first-hand pain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), scholars interpreted this activations in terms of empathy, whereby individuals simulate the observed state on oneself ( ;  ;  ). Critically, expert medical practitioners exhibited lower neural response in these regions ( ;  ), whereas they appear to over-recruit prefrontal structures, often implicated in regulation and control ( ), possibly reflecting enhanced ability at regulating their primary empathetic responses to the sight of people potential sufferance. \n\nMedical experience and emotion regulation might not be sufficient for explaining the entirety of the phenomenon. In clinical settings, acknowledging high levels of pain often leads to the prescription of strong analgesics, which however have contraindications for patients\u2019 health ( ;  ;  ). Concerns for such side-effects (e.g. opiophobia) contribute to inadequate pain treatment in medical settings ( ;  ;  ), as healthcare providers prioritize those cases in which pain is unequivocally established. In this perspective, one study showed that doctors and nurses tended to underestimate pain in larger extent when presented with cues that patients might have lied or exaggerate their ratings ( ). In a similar vein, recent qualitative investigations revealed that emergency nurses tend to privilege their own personal judgments rather than patients pain-ratings ( ;  ). Furthermore, when their clinical assessment is inconsistent with the self-reports (e.g. patients denounce high suffering while few minutes before they were chatting/laughing), nurses try to convince patients to reappraise their pain, or at least mark their own point of view in the clinical chart when transferring the case to a colleague ( ). Thus, healthcare providers appear to scrutinize the reliability of patients\u2019 pain and, in some case, even to mistrust their reports and feedbacks, at the advantage of the opinion of other medical practitioners. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study investigated systematically the role played by patients\u2019 feedbacks in pain assessments, and whether this influence changes with respect to that of other physicians. \n\nPsychology and neuroscience literature provided us with several tools to investigate the role of social influence in individuals\u2019 perceptual decisions and subjective experiences ( ;  ;  ;  ). In a seminal paradigm, participants evaluated the attractiveness of women and, subsequently, saw a feedback representative of peers\u2019 mean ratings ( ). Critically, when unexpectedly requested to repeat the task, participants reappraised each face consistently with the feedback received. Furthermore, a large discrepancy with others\u2019 evaluations increased the neural activity in the dorsal-posterior portion of the medial prefrontal cortex (dpMPFC), often implicated in prediction error, whereas agreement with these feedbacks recruited the reward system in the ventral striatum (VS) ( , see also   as meta-analysis). These effects have supported the idea that, even in subjective decisions with no correct/incorrect answers, participants considered the opinion of peers as an indirect proxy of their proficiency in the task ( ). \n\nThe present research aims at testing the degree with which healthcare providers take into account feedbacks about their pain assessment, and whether they weight in different extent the opinion of the patient from that of other physicians. Across two-experiments, we implemented a modified version of the social influence paradigm described above ( ;  ). Here, individuals appraised the pain of facial expression video-clips, and subsequently were confronted with two feedbacks (see  ): the self-report of the person in pain (the   Target   of each video) and the average opinion of 20 medical practitioners (hereafter,   MPs  ). The two feedbacks occurred simultaneously, and each of them could appear either at a lower, equal or higher position with respect to participants\u2019 initial rating (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). After 30 min from the end of this first session, participants were unexpectedly asked to evaluate again the same facial expressions, thus providing the opportunity to assess if their initial evaluations changed and, in that case, which feedback (  Target   vs.   MPs  ) best explained the reappraisal. In the context of pain assessments, the rating of the patient should represent the most reliable source of information to which compare one\u2019s performance. Hence, individuals\u2019 behavioral and neural responses should ideally be influenced in privileged fashion by the   Target  \u2018s feedback, as opposed to that of   MPs   who are not experiencing the pain directly. However, healthcare providers might mistrust information arising from the person in pain, and privilege the one of physicians, toward which they have developed positive dispositions. Hence, when confronted with feedbacks about their pain assessment, they might value in greater extent the opinion of other doctors at the expense of that of the patients. \n   Schematic representation of trial structure in the first session.  \nFor demonstrative purposes, one author of the study (GD) is depicted in the figure expressing pain in similar way to the video-clips used as stimuli ( ). \n  \n\n## Results \n  \n### Population validation \n  \nIn the present study, we recruited as a population of interest medical students from different years of medical faculty. This population was chosen due to its feasibility in terms of recruitment, and the straightforward quantification of individual experience (corresponding to the year of enrollment at university, regardless of future specializations, department, hierarchy, etc.). Furthermore, pain underestimation has been documented also in medical students (at least after 3 years,  ), thus making this population suitable for our research question. Finally, we assumed that these individuals would display stronger positive dispositions toward the category of physicians, relatively to lay individuals. This assumption was validated by a pilot experiment (Pilot 1, see Appendix 1) run on an independent population of 155 participants, organized in four groups: 38 Experienced Medical Students (EMS, from the 5th and 6th year), 32 Intermediate Medical Students (IMS, from the 3rd and 4th year), 56 Young Medical Students (YMS, from the 1st and 2nd year), and 29 lay Controls (from different faculties/professions, except those related to medicine, infirmary, dentistry and physiotherapy). Through an implicit association task (IAT), we calculated an index (D-score) reflecting strength of positive disposition toward the category of   MPs   (relative to non-  MPs  ). An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) aimed at testing for group differences revealed higher D-scores in EMS, relative to Controls and less experienced students (see  ; see also   for a similar effect in subjects from Experiment 2). \n   Behavioral Results of IAT and first session.  \nBoxplots and individual data describing (  A\u2013D  ) the IAT D-score across groups (higher values refer to stronger implicit positive dispositions toward the category of MPs; see Appendix 1); (  B\u2013E  ), Pain Intensity Ratings from first session of the task; (  C\u2013F  ) the Distrust about pain authenticity from the final debrief session.\u00a0In all plots, data are divided across groups, referring to Controls [C], Young Medical Students [YMS], Intermediate Medical Students [IMS] and Experienced Medical Students [EMS]. For each boxplot graph, the horizontal line represents the median value of the distribution, the star represents the average, the box edges refer to the inter-quartile range, and the whiskers to the data range within 1.5 of the inter-quartile range.

'**' and '*' refer to independent sample t-tests associated with p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively. \n  \n\n### Pain expressions ratings \n  \nHaving established that experienced medical students (EMS) are especially positively disposed toward the category of physicians (relative to other categories), we then tested whether they differed in the way in which they assess pain, and take into considerations feedbacks about their assessment. In Experiment 1, we recruited 120 participants, organized as 30 Controls, 30 YMS, 30 IMS, and 30 EMS.   provides full details about demographic information of these participants, with controls displaying comparable age to EMS. As first step, we tested whether the mean pain rating prior to the presentation of any feedback changed as function of   Group   through an ANOVA with   Gender   and   Age   as nuisance control variables. The analysis confirmed an effect of   Group   (  F   = 3.09; p=0.030). Post-hoc t-tests showed that YMS were associated with higher ratings than both Controls (  t   = 2.55; p=0.013) and EMS (  t   = 2.79; p=0.007, see  ). No significant difference was found when testing all the other possible combinations of groups (|  t  |<1.75, p>0.082). We also found an effect of   Gender   (  F   = 5.58; p=0.020), reflecting more pronounced ratings in female, relative to male, subjects (  Age: F   = 1.27; p=0.271). \n\nIn Experiment 2, we repeated the same paradigm (with minor adjustments, see methods) by focusing specifically on 52 participants (26 Controls and 26 EMS), and by recording neural responses (through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging [fMRI]). The pain ratings from this experiment did not change as function of   Group   (  F   = 0.84; p=0.369; all other effects   F  \u00a0<\u00a01.36; p>0.249,  ), consistently with Experiment one when the same groups were compared ( ). We then looked at the neural activity and searched for regions sensitive to the \u2018painfulness\u2019 of the expressions (and not for the mere presentation of a face). This was achieved by testing effects significantly associated with the parametrical modulation of pain ratings (whilst controlling for   Gender   and   Age  ). We first tested the main effect (activations common to both groups) and found a positive linear relationship at the level of amygdala extending to the periaqueductal grey (PAG), and to the fusiform gyrus ( , green blobs). Furthermore, when applying small volume correction in regions previously implicated in paradigms for pain empathy ( , see methods) the left anterior insula (AI) was also found (see   for full details). These effects were consistent with previous literature on emotional facial expressions ( ;  ;  ;  ), and on processing others\u2019 pain through the same networks of first-hand pain experience ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Subsequently, we analyzed group differences. We found stronger modulations in Controls as opposed to EMS in the dorsal portion of the anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Under small volume correction, we also implicated the left ventral AI ( , red blobs). Overall, our data converge with, but also extend, previous evidence by showing that medical education leads to decreased sensitivity to others\u2019 pain ( ;  ;  ;  ), both in terms of behavioral ratings (when comparing EMS to YMS) and in the neural response of predefined regions such as AI and dACC (when comparing EMS to Controls). \n   Surface renderings displaying regions implicated in the parametrical modulation of pain ratings.  \nEffects are displayed under a height threshold corresponding to p<0.001, with each region surviving cluster-correction for multiple comparisons for the whole brain, or associated with a peak surviving small volume correction for a mask of interest (this is the case of the two insular activations). Green blobs describe regions observed when taking into account both groups (main effect), whereas red regions display stronger effects for Controls as opposed to EMS. Parameter estimates from two regions implicated in group differences are displayed through boxplots. AI: Anterior Insula. dACC: dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex; Amy: Amygdala. \n  \nUp to now, we investigated inter-individual differences only in terms of group. However, it is possible that participants\u2019 performance might be better explained in terms of positive dispositions toward   MPs   (as measured only in Experiment two through the same IAT implemented in Pilot 1), in terms of individual   Distrust   towards the expressions\u2019 authenticity (measured in the debrief in Experiments 1 and 2), or in terms of individual empathic traits (measured through the Interpersonal Reactivity Index questionnaire;  ). We repeated all the analyses carried out above, by replacing the   Group   factor with either the IAT D-Score, the   Distrust   estimate, or each empathic score as continuous regressors. Behavioral results were not systematic across experiments, with   Distrust   influencing only Experiment 1 (Exp 1:   b  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.31,   F   = 5.50, p=0.021;   b  \u00a0=\u00a00.02,   F   = 0.02, p=0.884), and perspective rating scores only Experiment 2 (Exp 1:   b  \u00a0=\u00a00.02,   F   = 0.60, p=0.442; Exp 2:   b  \u00a0=\u00a00.07,   F   = 4.06, p=0.0497; all other covariates   F  \u00a0<\u00a02.38, p>0.123). We found no effect on the neural responses. \n\n\n### Effect of feedback \n  \nWe assessed whether participants evaluations were influenced by the presentation of the social feedbacks. For this purpose, we calculated a measure of Reappraisal, defined as the change in rating observed when participants were (unexpectedly) asked to evaluate the same facial expression again at the end of the experiment (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). The closer this value is to zero, the more participants\u2019 evaluation of a given face was stable across time. The more the value differed from zero, the more participants adjusted their evaluation. \n\nWe therefore run a multi-level regression to see whether single-trial Reappraisal changed as function of the relative position of the two social feedbacks, with the purpose of testing whether participants adjusted more strongly toward one feedback (  Target   vs.   MPs  ), and whether such adjustment changed as function of   Group.   In both experiments, the analysis of Reappraisal revealed a main effect of both   Target   (Exp 1:   b\u00a0=  \u00a00.13,   F  \u00a0=\u00a052.63, p   <\u00a00  .001; Exp 2:   b\u00a0=  \u00a00.07,   F  \u00a0=\u00a05.70, p =\u00a00.022) and   MPs   (Exp 1:   b\u00a0=  \u00a00.12,   F  \u00a0=\u00a019.40, p   <\u00a00  .001; Exp 2:   b\u00a0=  \u00a00.11,   F  \u00a0=\u00a011.57, p   <\u00a0  0.001) feedbacks.   shows Reappraisal values across three relative feedback positions on the scale. When each feedback was higher than participants\u2019 initial evaluation, a positive adjustment was observed. This was instead not the case when the feedbacks appeared in the same or lower positions of the scale (at least not systematically across experiments). No significance was associated with   Group, Gender   or   Age   (  F  \u00a0\u2264\u00a02.57, p   \u2265\u00a0  0.053). \n   Behavioral Results of Reapprisal and Distrust.  \n(  A  ) Boxplots and individual data describing the mean.

Data are presented separately for Target (yellow dots) and MPs (violet dots) feedbacks, and for their relative position (Lower, Equal, Higher) with respect to participants initial ratings. The top subplot describes the data from Experiment 1, whereas the bottom subplot describes the data from Experiment 2. (  B  ) For Experiment 1, we display also a scatter plot and confidence intervals area describing individual effects of MPs feedbacks\u2019 on Reappraisal plotted against Distrust (top row). Parameters (  b  ) were obtained by a linear regression, similar to that used in the main analysis, but run separately for each individual subject. The higher b, the more the reappraisal is explainable according to the position of a specific feedback. The linear relation is further explored through boxplots displaying the Reappraisal for MPs\u2019 feedbacks, separately for individuals with high/low levels of distrust (bottom row). Note that in all subplots the feedbacks\u2019 position is displayed across three discrete categories to improve readability, although in the experiment it changed across a continuum. \u2018***\u201d, \u2018**\u201d, \u2018*\u201d refer to significance associated with paired t-tests or Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 rank-correlation coefficient at p<0.001, p<0.01, and p<0.05 respectively. \n  \nWe then looked at the brain activity (from Experiment 2) evoked by the presentation of the feedbacks (see  \u2013  for full details). Brain activity was tested under a similar rationale than Reappraisal, with the exception that in this case we modeled parametrically the absolute discrepancy between participants\u2019 ratings and the feedback, with the purpose of identifying regions sensitive to \u2018errors\u2019 in either direction. Within this framework, discrepancy effects were found in a widespread network involving dpMPFC and right AI extending to inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; see  , white overlapping blobs). Importantly, this network was highly reminiscent with previous studies testing deviation effects of social influence on subjective evaluations ( ;  ) (see  ), and appeared recruited for both kinds of feedback (  Target  ,   MPs  ). Visual inspection of the parameters extracted from dpMPFC ( ) suggest that dpMPFC could be slightly more sensitive to deviations toward the lower levels of the scale, rather deviations per se. We tested this hypothesis by running a follow-up model where signed (rather than absolute) discrepancy was specified instead. This allowed us to search for regions responding more strongly to positive than negative deviations of the same magnitude, and   vice versa  . We found no effect, neither for the Target feedback nor for the   MPs  . Hence, the modulations described in   are better explainable in terms of absolute discrepancy. \n   Surface rendering showing significant increase of neural activity associated with the (  A  ) deviation or (  B  ) agreement with the social feedbacks.  \nActivation associated with the Target are displayed in yellow, whereas those associated with the MPs are displayed in violet.

(  D  ) Parameter estimates extracted from two regions of interest and displayed separately for Target (yellow dots) and MPs (violet dots) feedbacks, and for their relative position (Lower, Equal, Higher) with respect to participants ratings. Note that feedbacks\u2019 position is displayed across three discrete categories to improve readability, although in the experiment it changed across a continuum (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). '***', '**', and '*' refer to t-tests associated with p<0.001, p<0.01, and p<0.05, respectively. \n  \nWe also investigated regions responding to the agreement between participants\u2019 own rating and the position of the feedback (as in previous studies on the same paradigm,  ;  ), by testing for negative modulations of the absolute discrepancy with the feedbacks: that\u00a0is, areas responding the most when the gap with the social feedbacks was 0. For both the   Target   and the   MPs  , we found a widespread network which converged around the bilateral parietal and ventral occipital cortex (see  , white overlapping blobs). Critically, for the   Target   feedback only, the ventral striatum (VS) and the Putamen were also found in line with previous observations ( ;  ). These regions, however, were not observed for   MPs  . Finally, when testing the differential contrast   Target  \u00a0>  MPs  , we confirmed an effect of the VS/Putamen in the direction of a stronger agreement-related activity for the   Target   ( ). \n\nFinally, we tested whether discrepancy and agreement effects differed significantly across group (Controls vs. EMS). We did not found modulations at the level of neither dpMPFC/AI (for discrepancy) nor VS (for agreement). Unexpectedly, Controls showed different effects than EMS in the left Supramarginal Gyrus, for the   Target   feedback, and in MCC, for the   MPs   (see  , for more details). \n\n\n### Effect of distrust \n  \nConsistently with what done in the analysis of pain expression ratings, we tested whether individual differences associated with the processing of feedbacks could be explained in terms of positive dispositions toward MPs (in Experiment 2). This analysis revealed no effects in behavioral (  F  \u00a0<\u00a01.73, p>0.191) or neural responses. We then tested for an effect associated with   Distrust   toward the facial expression\u2019s authenticity and found, in Experiment 1, a significant   MPs  *  Distrust   interaction (Exp 1:   b\u00a0=  \u00a00.04,   F  \u00a0=\u00a06.58, p   =\u00a0  0.010; Exp 2:   b\u00a0=  \u00a0\u22120.02,   F  \u00a0=\u00a00.47, p   =\u00a0  0.496).   displays individual effects of   MPs   feedback on Reappraisal (obtained from a linear model fitted on each subject individually) increasing linearly with   Distrust  , thus suggesting that participants adjusted more their evaluation toward the physicians\u2019 feedback, the more they were suspicious on the expression\u2019s authenticity. Instead, Distrust played no role in the adjustment to the   Target   feedback or as a main effect (  F  \u00a0<\u00a01.01, p >\u00a00.317). Unfortunately, we did not replicate the behavioral effects of distrust in Experiment 2. Interestingly, however, the analysis of the neural activity in Experiment two revealed that   Distrust   influenced how the Ventral Striatum (VS) responded to feedback agreement. This was observed when modeling   Distrust   against the differential contrast   Target\u00a0>MPs  , which revealed that the effect observed in   decreased linearly the more participants questioned the expression\u2019s authenticity. More specifically, whereas individuals with low distrust show strong agreement effect in this region, with enhanced activity whenever the   Target  \u2019s feedback coincides with their own judgment, individuals highly doubtful about the expression\u2019s authenticity show comparable response for all   Target   feedback positions ( , yellow dots). Furthermore, this effect did not generalize to the MPs\u2019 feedback, which exhibited the opposite trend (violet dots). \n   Distrust effect.  \n(  A  ) Surface rendering displaying the effects of agreement toward the Target feedback interacting with Distrust. The effect is displayed under a height threshold corresponding to p<0.001, and survivse cluster-correction for multiple comparisons for the whole brain. (  B  ) The parameters extracted by the highlighted Ventral Striatum (VS) plotted against Distrust self-reports in a linear regression with confidence intervals area (higher parameters reflect stronger agreement effects). (  C  ) The linear regression is further explored through boxplots displaying VS neural activity separately for Target (yellow dots) and MPs (violet dots) feedbacks, for their relative position (Lower, Equal, Higher) with respect to participants ratings, and separately for individuals with high/low levels of distrust. Parameter plots are associated with Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 rank-correlation coefficient or paired-sample t-test, with '***', '**', and '*' referring to significance at p<0.001, p<0.01, and p<0.05, respectively. \n  \nFinally, we carried out control analyses to assess whether the effects of   Distrust   were confounded by an overall lack of reliance toward the experimental paradigm (rather than the facial expression specifically). For this purpose, we reanalyzed   Distrust   in combination of another item form the post-experimental debrief assessing individual thoughts about another part of the task (the feedbacks). Full details are provided in Appendix 1, and confirm that participants\u2019 responses in our task were influenced selectively by considerations toward the authenticity of the facial expressions. Overall, our data show that   Distrust   influences the processing of the feedbacks about one\u2019s pain assessment, by inhibiting the neural processing implicated in treating information from the person in pain (Experiment 2), and consequently promoting adjustment toward the opinion of physicians (Experiment 1). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we tested whether individuals on the verge of becoming physicians (experienced medical students; EMS) differed from younger colleagues and lay controls in the way in which they appraise people\u2019s pain, and take into account feedbacks from both the suffering person (  Target  ) and other medical practitioners (  MPs  ). For this purpose, we run two experiments (plus preliminary pilots): the first testing behavioral effects in students at different years of enrolment in medical faculty (plus lay controls), and the second recording neural activity (with fMRI) specifically on EMS and Controls. We found that EMS show decreased sensitivity toward painful facial expressions, in terms of both behavioral ratings and neural response in a predefined brain network (centered on AI and dACC) implicated in the processing people\u2019s sufferance ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Instead, we found that the sensitivity to feedbacks was influenced by the degree of distrust. Indeed, individuals who were doubtful about the expressions\u2019 authenticity revealed decreased neural response in the reward system (Ventral Striatum [VS] and Putamen) when their judgment coincided with the self-report of the person in pain and were more incline to adjust their evaluation toward the opinion of other   MPs  . Overall, our study underscores the multiple processes influencing the evaluation of pain in medical practitioners, as early as in university years: whereas the students\u2019 seniority influenced the assessment of the patient\u2019s pain, it is distrust that affected the way in which feedbacks from other people (including the patient) are taken into account. \n\n### Experience in medical university influences pain processing \n  \nConsistently with previous studies showing that medical students ( ) and practitioners ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) underestimated others\u2019 pain proportionally to their experience ( ;  ), in Experiment 1 we found that students\u2019 seniority influenced negatively the rating of others\u2019 pain expressions ( ). Such effect appeared driven in large extent by young students who provide higher ratings than the other groups, whereas no difference was observed between Controls with no medical education and EMS ( ). This suggests that, at the beginning of their medical tenure, individuals might be highly vigilant to signs about patients\u2019 conditions (including pain), and that this effect decreased linearly in subsequent years. \n\nInterestingly, Experiment two showed discrepancies between Controls and EMS in the neural response evoked from painful facial expressions. In particular, a network comprehending the anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) showed stronger linear effects of pain ratings in controls than in EMS ( ). This network has been repeatedly implicated in previous experiments involving the processing and empathizing with others\u2019 pain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), and has been often considered the neural substrate for empathy ( ;  ;  ). Critically, previous studies have already shown how professional healthcare providers display decreased activity in these regions to the sight of others\u2019 injuries ( ;  ), an effect that is more pronounced in individuals with more experience in the field ( ). Our data extend these neural findings to a younger population at the end of their university program in medicine, thus suggesting a major role played by medical education in the responsiveness of this network. Furthermore, the analysis of brain activity of Experiment two allows to detect group differences (Controls vs. EMS) which were not observed from the behavioral measures from both experiments. This underlies the ability of neuroimaging techniques to capture also those neural processes which are too subtle to impact overt behavior. \n\nThe negative effect played by medical scholarly and professional experience in the neural response to others\u2019 pain has been often interpreted in terms of decreased empathic response, possibly promoted by enhanced regulatory abilities ( ;  ), and allowing healthcare providers to interact with patients without any contagion from their sufferance ( ;  ;  ). Our data are not against this interpretation, although we advise caution in interpreting modulations in AI/dACC to others\u2019 pain as reflective of overall empathy changes. Indeed, our groups did not differ in terms of empathic traits from dedicated questionnaires (see  ), and replacing the grouping variable with these scores in the neuroimaging analysis did not led to any result (scores of perspective taking influenced behavioral ratings, but only in Experiment 2). Also in the literature, positive correlations between AI/dACC response to others\u2019 pain and empathy scores were found in only\u00a0~30% of neuroimaging studies who tested this relation (see  , for meta-analytic evidence). Furthermore, in contrast to neuroimaging findings, studies testing the role of medical experience on empathy scores have mixed results, with some suggesting a negative modulation ( ;  ;  ;  ), and others reporting no change ( ;  ) or even a positive effect ( ;  ;  ), with the direction of the effect changing as function of the score employed ( ). \n\nThe mixed evidence from the literature could reflect the heterogeneity of the notion of empathy, which varies extensively across domains and scholars in terms of definitions and measures, with some tailored at measuring individuals\u2019 ability to share and resonate with pain specifically, whereas others tapping a more broad sensitivity to different emotional states (disgust, anger, joy) which are less relevant in healthcare settings. For these reasons, we prefer a more parsimonious interpretation, whereby medical experience impacts individual sensitivity to others\u2019 pain, rather than individuals overall empathetic abilities. This process has the beneficial effect of shielding physicians from the emotional weight sharing others\u2019 suffering ( ;  ;  ), but at the same time exposes patients (especially women and individuals from ethnical minorities,  ;  ;  ;  ) to the risk of being unrelieved from their condition. \n\n\n### General and specific effects in feedback processing \n  \nWhen analyzing the degree to which individuals react to feedbacks, we found evidence of both general effects (common to   Target   and   MPs  ), but also modulations specific for one source of information. At the behavioral level, we found that participants adjusted their pain ratings as function of any kind of feedback ( ). This was mirrored by the analysis of brain activity, which revealed that the signal in a widespread network centered in dpMPFC increased linearly with the absolute discrepancy between participants\u2019 initial ratings and the presentation of any kind of feedback ( ). These converging effects of discrepancy for   Target  /  MPs   were highly reminiscent to those observed in previous studies testing social discrepancy in other forms of perceptual judgment ( ;  ). \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are three alternative ways to interpret these general effects. First, part of participants\u2019 monitoring system treats information from the physicians as relevant as that from the person experiencing pain directly. Hence, although the feedbacks are interpreted in terms of their social meaning, none of them are taken into account in a privileged fashion, at least in the context of discrepancies. Second, it is possible that participants were captured by the presence of any visual stimulus far from their current attentional focus (the initial rating). This conjecture draws from a recent study employing a similar paradigm, in which participants\u2019 reappraisal was also influenced by feedbacks with no social meaning ( , but see  ). Third, scholars suggested a potential confound of the initial rating, which depends on the position of the feedback ( ;  ). Indeed, trials with large deviance in one direction are by definition those in which the initial rating is sufficiently distant from the physical boundary of the scale to allow the presentation of the feedback (see methods). Hence, discrepancy effects could (at least in principle) be a delayed after-effects of the previous rated pain. Currently, our results do not allow to dissociate between these three alternative interpretations. Future research, involving the implementation of additional control conditions, will ascertain whether the divergence effects observed here underlie a true processing of the social information conveyed by the feedbacks. \n\nIn sharp contrast from discrepancy effects, the neural modulations evoked by agreement appear to be selective for one source of information. More specifically, in line with previous studies investigating effects of social influence ( ;  ), we found that the agreement with the   Target   feedback enhanced activity in the VS and Putamen ( ). Critically, such effect was not observed for   MPs   feedback, a pattern confirmed also when testing the direct contrast   Target  \u00a0>  MPs   ( ). Hence, the analysis of convergences provides clear evidence that participants do take into account the social meaning of the feedbacks (over and above other potential non-social confounds), with VS/Putamen privileging information arising from the person in pain as opposed to that coming from physicians. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study documenting a dissociation of different networks subtending divergence   vs  . agreement effects in social influence paradigms. Indeed,   interpreted the neural responses in social influence paradigms as part of a unique mechanism for reinforcement learning, according to which midbrain dopaminergic signals monitor whether an outcome is perceived as negative or positive by projecting to neural structures in dpMPFC and VS, respectively ( ). Within this framework, divergence/convergence effects are essentially two sides of the same coin. However, this view is not supported by our data showing a further functional differentiation among the two sets of regions. Whereas discrepancy effects appear to work on a more general level (without distinguishing between different sources of information), agreement effects in VS/Putamen were specific for the feedback from the person in pain, suggesting a selective monitoring of the most relevant source of information for the decision. Hence, VS is not merely the opposite of dpMPFC, but responds according to different principles/priorities. \n\n\n### Distrust influences specific feedback processing \n  \nAcross both experiments, we found that   Distrust   was the key factor explaining whether participants valued in greater extent the information arising from   Target   or   MPs  . In Experiment 1, participants most doubtful about the pain\u2019s authenticity adjusted their response more strongly toward   MPs  . This effect was not replicated in Experiment 2 (in which we recruited a smaller sample size, and did not include young and intermediate medical students). However, in Experiment 2,   Distrust   influenced the neural responses at the level of VS, with agreement effects for the   Target   decreasing progressively the more participants doubted the faces in the videos, and agreement effects for   MPs   showing the opposite trend. Despite their differences, the two studies converge in pointing a major role of   Distrust   in the way in which individuals process feedbacks about their pain evaluations. Importantly, such effect is not confounded with participants\u2019 overall distrust toward the experimental set-up, but reflect specific considerations of the facial expressions implemented (see Appendix 1). Furthermore,   Distrust   operates independently from the grouping factor and from the personal dispositions toward the category of doctors (measured through the IAT). Hence, our effects might not reflect experience, belongingness or personal positive dispositions toward   MPs  , but possibly the fact that doctors are figures of authority which become much more salient when the facial expression cannot be relied upon. \n\nPrevious studies already revealed that healthcare providers underestimated patients\u2019 pain in greater extent when they were given hints about potential deceptive attempts to get attention or non-necessary medication ( ). Furthermore, qualitative investigations suggested that emergency nurses sometimes have difficulty suspending their point of view when confronted with patients whose pain-reports conflict strongly with their initial judgment ( ;  ). Our study provides a mechanistic explanation of these observations, by revealing that distrust operates on part of the network for feedback-based learning, and specifically by altering the sensitivity of the reward system to information from the person in pain. Plainly put, if the   Target   is not to be trusted, his/her self-reports become less relevant, and VS might react less strongly to any agreement with one\u2019s rating. \n\nOur findings are particularly relevant in clinical settings, where pain appraisal is the basis for the selection of subsequent therapeutic procedures, including the prescription of strong (and potentially dangerous) painkillers. In this context, the deontological need to relieve patient\u2019s pain is often counterweighted by the equally relevant need to prevent future side-effects and complications, a conflict that is often resolved by each individual based on personal ability to cope with uncertainty and sensitivity to errors ( ). Obviously, a key source of information for these decisions is the reliability of available pain cues (e.g.   is the facial expression genuine?  ) which, if estimated below a given threshold, can relieve caregivers from any struggle by prioritizing other clinical considerations over the management of patients\u2019 pain. As unfortunate drawback, estimated reliability might be vulnerable to biases, including those related to the social and ethical condition of the patient. Previous studies showed that confronting individuals from different social and ethnic group can impact profoundly representation of trust and associated activity in VS ( ;  ;  ), but also sensitivity to their pain ( ;  ) including the neural responses in AI and dACC ( ;  ;  ). As such, the interplay between the reward system and AI-dACC network might offer a plausible model to explain why specific social/ethnic categories are less likely to be acknowledged for their pain and receive adequate treatment. Future studies will need to explore this. \n\n\n### Limitations of the study and concluding remarks \n  \nThe present study investigates the role of medical experience by recruiting independent groups at different years of university. As such, our study shares the weaknesses of cross-sectional investigations ( ), as the role of experience was not tested longitudinally in the same population. In particular, some of our effects might be influenced by individual traits and features which are more frequently observed in medical students (especially those who reach the end of their tenure) as opposed to lay controls. In our analysis, we took care to account for several potential confounding variables, such as gender, age, or empathic traits. Other measures (e.g. personality traits) appeared fairly stable across the different groups (with only few differences, not systematic across experiments; see  ), and therefore are unlikely to have confounded our results. Yet, it is still possible that our results could have been influenced also by other factors untested in the present study. For instance, relevant missing information are the detailed educational level of Controls (including their year of enrollment at university) and participants\u2019 ethnic group. Finally, in designing our study we followed previous paradigms in which social feedbacks (in our case   MPs  ) were described as the aggregate opinion of many individuals from a community ( ;  ). This however opens the question as to whether   Distrust   promotes reliance toward   MPs   feedback due to their professional background, their size (an opinion of 20 is more reliable than that of one) or a combination of both factors. Future studies will need to duly account for these limitations. \n\nNotwithstanding these considerations, our study provides compelling evidence of an independent contribution of experience and   Distrust   in different aspects of pain management. Experience in medical faculty influenced individuals\u2019 assessment of pain, both at the level of explicit ratings, and on a network comprehending insular and cingulate cortex knowingly sensitive to cues about people\u2019s suffering ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Additionally,   Distrust   affected the processing of feedbacks about one\u2019s assessments, by decreasing striatal activity whenever the   Target  \u2019s reports match participants\u2019 initial ratings, and by leading participants to rely more on the opinion of other doctors. Overall, our study documents relevant changes in the neural circuity underling pain assessment and feedback processing that occur already at the very early stages of medical career. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Experiment 1 \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nBecause this was an exploratory experiment, we recruited an overall of 120 participants, organized in four groups of 30 subjects. The first group comprehended lay individuals (12 males out of 30, mean age\u00a0=\u00a025.03 years\u00b14.75 Standard Deviation [SD]) who were recruited among different faculties and professions, except those related to medicine, infirmary, dentistry, and physiotherapy. The remaining 90 participants (26 males, mean age\u00a0=\u00a022.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.86) were recruited among students enrolled from the 1 st to the 6th year of medical faculty at the University of Geneva and Lausanne (1 st year\u00a0=\u00a014, 2nd year\u00a0=\u00a016, 3rd year, N\u00a0=\u00a015; 4th year, N\u00a0=\u00a015; 5th year, N\u00a0=\u00a017; 6th year, N\u00a0=\u00a013). We divided the total sample into additional groups of 30 participants each: controls, Young Medical Students (YMS) from the 1st and 2nd year of faculty, Intermediate Medical Students (IMS) from the 3rd and 4th year and Experienced Medical Students (EMS) from the 5th and 6th year. The participants did not report any history of neurological nor psychiatric illness and were na\u00efve to the purpose of the study. Furthermore, they signed an informed consent prior to the experiment. This research (both experiments) was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethical committee (Commission Cantonale d'\u00c9thique e de la Recherce [CCER] of Geneva, protocol code: CCER N. 2016\u201301862). \n\n\n#### Stimuli \n  \nWe used a database of 44 videos of painful facial expressions from   depicting Caucasian actors wearing headphones and simulating painful reactions to a high pitch noise (see  ). A validation pilot experiment (Pilot 2) on 24 independent lay participants (seven males, age 23.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.12) revealed that the pain of these expressions was rated on average 7.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.26 on a scale ranging from 1 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). Ratings for each isolated video were highly similar with one another, with the least painful clip evaluated on average 7.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.55 and the most painful clip 7.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.41. \n\n\n#### Experimental set-up \n  \nThe main experimental session was organized in three blocks. In the first block, participants saw a fixation cross (1 s) followed by one video (3 s) and were asked to estimate the amount of pain experienced by the person in the video, by moving a randomly-presented rectangular cursor on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ranging from \u2018no pain at all\u2019 (corresponding to value 1) to \u2018the worst pain imaginable\u2019 (corresponding to value 10). Following the rating (7 s), participants were exposed to two simultaneous feedbacks (3 s) that represented the judgement of the   Target   of the video and the average judgement of 20 emergency doctors that previously rated the same video-clips. These two feedbacks were displayed by cursors similar to that of the participant but of different colors (color codes were randomized across participants). Each kind of feedback was independent and orthogonal as respect to the other and described pain levels, which could be higher, equal or lower, compared to the participant. This led to a 3 \u00d7 3 design, with nine different conditions. Feedbacks were located on the scale according to a normal distribution with mean\u00a0+2.2, 0 and \u22122.2 scale points for values higher, equal and lower ratings respectively, and\u00a0\u00b10.5 as standard deviation that helped in providing an effect of variability consistent with that of a human judgement. In case the feedbacks had to appear out of the physical limit of the scale, they were instead displayed at the further extremity within the scale. Each video appeared just once (total number\u00a0=\u00a044) and was randomly assigned to one of the nine conditions. This led to eight conditions associated with five videos, and one condition associated with four videos (5  *  8\u00a0+\u00a04\u00a0  =  \u00a044). The association between conditions and videos was different for each subject, thus preventing the presence of one condition systematically associated with less videos. \n\nIn a second block, participants completed a battery of questionnaires in a time-window of 30 min (see below). This block served also to the purpose of allowing some time to pass between the first and the third block. If participants completed the questionnaires before the end of the 30-min session, they were asked to wait for the remaining time. If they were still filling the questionnaires at the end of the 30  minute, they were asked to discontinue and finish after the third block. This insured that for all participants the same delay was implemented between the first and third block. The questionnaires comprehended the French versions of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) ( ); the Situation Pain Questionnaire (SPQ) ( ); the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) ( ) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI) ( ). See   for more details. \n\nFinally, in the third block participants were unexpectedly asked to rate again all 44 videoclips, without however being exposed to any feedback. The experiment was programmed using Cogent (Wellcome Dept., London, UK) toolbox as implemented in Matlab R2012a (Mathworks, Natick, MA). \n\n\n#### Procedure \n  \nAfter signing the informed consent, participants could read the instructions and familiarize with the association between the cursors\u2019 colors and their meaning. During the rating session, responses were collected by pressing highlighted keys on the computer keyboard. The overall experiment lasted approximately 75 min (block 1:~15; block 2: 30 min and block 3:~15), and was followed by a short debriefing session in which participants replied to ad\u00a0hoc questions testing several aspects of the experimental manipulation (see Appendix 1 for further details). Finally, participants were asked to complete a set of questionnaires that they started during block two in case they could not finish before 30 min. The experiment took place at the Brain Behavioral Laboratory (BBL) in the Centre M\u00e9dical Universitaire (CMU) of the University of Geneva, Switzerland. \n\n\n#### Data analysis \n  \nAs a first step, we analyzed if the four groups of interest changed as function of their rating from the first session. This was achieved by feeding the median pain ratings in an Analysis of Variance with   Group   as between-subject factor. To account for potential age differences between the group, the ANOVA was also repeated by using age as covariate. \n\nSubsequently, we assessed whether participants changed their initial ratings as function of the social feedback. Following previous studies in the field ( ;  ), a measure of Reappraisal was considered, defined as the differential rating between the third and first block for each video. Single trial Reappraisal values were fed to a Linear Mixed Model (LMM) with the relative position of the   Target   and   MPs   feedbacks as continuous predictors. Furthermore, we also included   Group  ,   Gender  , and   Age   as between-subject predictors, each modeled as both main effect and in interaction with   Target   and   MPs  . Finally, the identity of the subjects and of the individuals portrayed in the videos was modeled as random factor (with random intercept, and slope for   Target   and   MPs  ). Additionally, we assessed whether individual differences in the task could be well explained in terms of beliefs about the authenticity of the pain observed. To assess this, the same LMM described above was repeated by replacing the   Group   factor with   Distrust   scores as continuous between-subject predictor. This score was obtained by the combination of two post-experimental debrief items (see Appendix 1 for more details).   Item 1  : \u2018I had the impression that the people in the video were simulating unpleasantness\u2019 (in French: \u2018J'ai eu l'impression que les gens de la vid\u00e9o ont simul\u00e9 le d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ment\u2019);   Item 2  : \u2018I had the impression that the pain observed was real\u2019 (\u2018J'ai eu l'impression que la douleur observ\u00e9e \u00e9tait r\u00e9elle\u2019). For both items, participants could give an answer in a five points Likert scale ranging from 1 [not at all] to 5 [absolutely]. As the reports of these two debrief items are complementary, a combined measure was calculated as follows:\u00a0 , which describes a   Distrust   scalar ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). The significance of the relevant effects in the LMM was calculated using the Satterthwaite approximation of the degrees of freedom, as implemented in the lmerTest package ( ) from R.3.4.4 software ( ). \n\n\n\n### Experiment 2 \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nFor this experiment, 28 experienced medical students (EMS) enrolled to the 5th and 6th year of medicine at the University of Geneva, responded to our recruitment call. Two of them were excluded due to non-agreement with the task. Therefore, the final sample of EMS was composed by 26 participants (nine males, age\u00a0=\u00a024.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.40). EMS participants were associated with a matched control group of 26 students not enrolled in medical-related faculties (13 males, age\u00a0=\u00a023.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.11). The recruitment was carried out as for Experiment 1. \n\n\n#### Experimental set-up and procedure \n  \nAfter having read and signed the consent form and MRI security check-list, participants lay supine on the scanner with their head fixated by firm foam pads. They underwent a unique scanning session of about 20 min, where they carried out the same task as in Experiment 1-block 1, with few changes. Firstly, due to exigencies of the functional data acquisition in the MRI, the inter-stimulus interval was jittered and ranged from 2 to 5 s. Furthermore, the two social feedbacks were not rectangular shapes, like in the case of the previous experiment, but two little icons representing schematically a physician (a shape of a person with a stethoscope) and the person depicted in the video (a shape of a person with headphones; consistently with the video database implemented,  ). This change was motivated by the fact that the rectangular feedbacks used in Experiment 1 ( ) could have been easily confused. Although all participants from Experiment one recalled the association between the rectangle color and its meaning in the debrief, it is still possible that, in several instances during the task, the different meaning of the two feedbacks might have slipped participants\u2019 mind. Hence, replacing the rectangular shapes with icons transparently interpretable should have minimized any risk of confusion, and provide a more sensitive experimental setting. A behavioral pilot study (Pilot 3) on 23 Control students (11 males, 22.26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.86 years old), confirmed that this modified set-up led to the similar effects of Reappraisal than Experiment 1 (main effect of   Target: b  \u00a0=\u00a00.07,   F  \u00a0=\u00a03.09, p=0.081;   MPs: b  \u00a0=\u00a00.15,   F  \u00a0=\u00a07.08, p=0.015). Furthermore, when comparing the data from this pilot with those from the Controls from Experiment 1, no effect of Experiment was found, neither as main effect, nor as interaction with   Target/MPs   (  F  \u00a0<\u00a01.22, p>0.270). Hence, the modified set-up had no impact in Controls\u2019 behavioral responses. \n\nFollowing the main task, participants exited the scanner, and filled demographic for about 30 min. Subsequently, as for Experiment 1, they were unexpectedly asked to rate again all the videoclips again, without being exposed to any feedback. Subjects carried out an Implicit Association Task identical to that of Pilot 1, and finally were debriefed. The whole experiment took place at the Human Neuroscience Platform of the Campus Biotech in Geneva. \n\nThe visual stimuli were presented on a 23\u2019 MRI compatible LCD screen (BOLDScreen23; Cambridge Research Systems, UK), at a resolution of 1024 \u00d7 768 (refresh rate 60 Hz) subtending a visual angle of approximately 11.8\u00b0 (vertical) x 15.6\u00b0. Key-presses were recorded on an MRI-compatible bimanual response button box (HH-2 \u00d7 4 C; Current Designs Inc, Philadelphia, PA). \n\n\n#### Data analysis \n  \nBehavioral data from Experiment two were organized and analyzed in the same way like that of Experiment 1. \n\n\n#### Brain activity \n  \nAs for the neuroimaging data, these were acquired through a Siemens Magnetom Prisma 3T scanner with a 64-channel head-and-neck coil. We used a multiband sequence with TR\u00a0=\u00a01100 ms, (TE)\u00a0=\u00a032 ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a050\u00b0, 66 interleaved slices, 112 \u00d7 112 in-plane resolution, 2 \u00d7 2\u00d72 mm voxel size, no inter-slice gap, multiband acceleration factor 6. Field map was estimated through the acquisition of 2 functional images with a different echo time (short TE\u00a0=\u00a04.92 ms; long TE\u00a0=\u00a07.38 ms). Structural images were acquired with a T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence (192 slices, TR\u00a0=\u00a02300 ms, TE\u00a0=\u00a02.32 ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a08\u00b0, slice thickness of 0.9 mm, in-plane resolution\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256, 0.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.9 mm voxel size). \n\nFunctional images were fed to standard preprocessing pipeline as implemented in SPM12 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, United Kingdom). This pipeline did realignment, unwrapping (using a field map image to account for geometric distortions because of magnetic field inhomogeneity), and normalization to the 152 Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) with voxel size resolution of 2 \u00d7 2\u00d72 mm. Finally, the volumes were smoothed by convolution with an 8 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. \n\nThe preprocessed images of each individual were then fed to a first level analysis using the general linear model framework implemented in SPM. More specifically, we modelled the onset of each pain expression as events of 3 s (corresponding to the duration of the video-clip). We also assessed whether face-evoked activity was explained by the pain ratings that participants were about to make through a dedicated parametrical modulator. Subsequently, we modelled the occurrence of the VAS as events of 7 s (corresponding to the delay between the presentation of the scale and the subsequent feedbacks). For this condition, we also modeled the actual displacement carried out by participants (the absolute difference between the randomly presented initial position of the cursor and participants\u2019 final rating) as a parametric modulator. Finally, and more critically, we modeled the occurrence of the feedbacks as events of 3 s. Feedback-related activity was associated with two parametric modulators: first the absolute deviation between participants\u2019 rating and the position of the   Target  \u2019s feedback, and the absolute deviation between participants\u2019 rating and the position of   MPs   feedback. Please note that, within this model, positive effects of each of these parametric modulators should be interpreted as brain activity increasing linearly with feedbacks\u2019 divergence from participants\u2019 initial rating. Instead, negative effects should capture effects related with feedbacks\u2019 convergence with the participants\u2019 rating. For each of the three main events vectors (facial expressions, VAS, and feedbacks), we accounted for habituation effects in neural responses by using the time-modulation option implemented in SPM, which creates additional regressors in which the trial order is modulated parametrically. This led to an overall of 10 regressors (three conditions\u00a0+\u00a07 parametric modulators), which were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function and associated with regressors describing their first-order time derivative. To account for movement-related variance, physiological-related artifacts, and other sources of noise, we also included the six realignment parameters, an estimate of cardiac- and inspiration-induced changes in the BOLD signal based on PhysIO toolbox ( ), and the average non-gray matter signal, defined as the coordinates with grey matter tissue probability\u00a0<0.02. This is the largest non-grey matter mask whose average signal is not confounded by the task manipulation (see  ), and as such represents an estimate of for global sources of noise that might can be accounted for without biasing the results ( ;  ;  ). Low-frequency signal drifts were filtered using a cutoff period of 128 s. Serial correlations in the neural signal were accounted through exponential covariance structures, as implemented in the \u2018FAST\u2019 option of SPM. \n\nParameters associated with conditions of interest (e.g. parametric modulators of   Target  ,   MPs   or contrast testing the differential effect between the two) were then fed in a second level, independent-samples t-test using random-effect analysis. Furthermore, inter-individual differences related to the IAT D-Score or to distrust estimates were modelled through linear regression. In all analyses,   Gender   and   Age   were always modeled as nuisance regressors. As first step, we considered only those effects throughout the whole brain that exceeded p<0.05, family-wise correction for multiple comparisons at the cluster level ( ), with an underlying height threshold of p<0.001, uncorrected. As second step, we also restricted our hypothesis based on regions previously implicated in the same paradigms. Specifically, for the processing of painful expressions, we took the most recent meta-analysis on pain empathy from  , and selected the regions jointly implicated in processing the sight of others\u2019 suffering and one\u2019s own pain response (Figure 15 in  , freely available at  ). Instead for the processing of social feedback, we took the meta-analysis maps from   revealing differential effects for: (1) divergence from social feedbacks, implicating a network containing mPFC and right AI; (2) convergence with social feedbacks, implicating VS (see Table 3 in  ; provided by the study\u2019s author). In both cases, the meta-analytic activation maps (thresholded to survive FWE correction for the whole brain) were binarized and used for small volume correction in our study. Within these areas, we considered significant those effects associated with p<0.05 FWE small volume correction at the voxel level. \n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8104963, "text_md5": "440ed7196f0f5ea97c53478bc7a7fe75", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 85], "journal": [86, 91], "publication_year": [93, 97], "title": [108, 228], "keywords": [242, 313], "abstract": [326, 1387], "body": [1396, 62267]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 33904406, "doi": "10.7554/eLife.63272", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8104963", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8104963"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8104963\">8104963</a>", "list_title": "PMC8104963  Medical education and distrust modulate the response of insular-cingulate network and ventral striatum in pain diagnosis"}

Although reality monitoring seems to overlap with the concept of self\u2010monitoring, which allows one to distinguish self\u2010generated actions or thoughts from those generated by others, the two concepts remain largely separate cognitive domains and their common brain substrates have received little attention. We investigated the brain regions involved in these two cognitive processes and explored the common brain regions they share. To do this, we conducted two separate coordinate\u2010based meta\u2010analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies assessing the brain regions involved in reality\u2010 and self\u2010monitoring. Few brain regions survived threshold\u2010free cluster enhancement family\u2010wise multiple comparison correction (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05), likely owing to the small number of studies identified. Using uncorrected statistical thresholds recommended by Signed Differential Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images, the meta\u2010analysis of reality\u2010monitoring studies (  k  \u2009=\u20099 studies including 172 healthy subjects) revealed clusters in the lobule VI of the cerebellum, the right anterior medial prefrontal cortex and anterior thalamic projections. The meta\u2010analysis of self\u2010monitoring studies (  k  \u2009=\u200912 studies including 192 healthy subjects) highlighted the involvement of a set of brain regions including the lobule VI of the left cerebellum and fronto\u2010temporo\u2010parietal regions. We showed with a conjunction analysis that the lobule VI of the cerebellum was consistently engaged in both reality\u2010 and self\u2010monitoring. The current findings offer new insights into the common brain regions underlying reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring, and suggest that the neural signature of the self that may occur during self\u2010production should persist in memories. \n  \nWe used a coordinate\u2010based meta\u2010analytic approach to investigate the neural substrates of reality\u2010monitoring. We reported the involvement of lobule VI of the cerebellum, the right anterior medial prefrontal cortex and anterior thalamic projections. We then conducted a conjunction analysis to detect brain regions common to reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring and identified that the lobule VI of the cerebellum is consistently engaged in both processes.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nHow can we determine that memories come from real perceptions and not from imagination? The process of making attributions about the source of memories between internal sources (such as imagination) and external sources (such as perception) is called reality monitoring. Strong reality\u2010monitoring capacities are necessary in everyday life, for instance, to distinguish our mental imagery, or the events that we daydream about, from the events that actually occurred. \n\nReality monitoring has been theorized into the \u201csource\u2010monitoring framework\u201d by Johnson et al. ( ), who suggested that memories did not come with a label indicating their source; but that the source is rather determined based on several cues associated with the event such as the amount of perceptual details, contextual information and cognitive operations. According to the source\u2010monitoring framework, veridical perceptions include more and stronger sensory details, whereas imagination is under more top\u2010down cognitive control signals due to the rich cognitive operations involved in generating the mental experience. A higher\u2010order reality\u2010monitoring mechanism is then supposed to integrate information about sensory signals and cognitive control to make source attributions (Garrison et al.,\u00a0 ; Johnson,\u00a0 ; Johnson et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nReality monitoring seems intrinsically tied to self\u2010monitoring, that is, the ability to distinguish self\u2010generated actions or thoughts from actions or thoughts generated by others, and more broadly to the concept of self\u2010agency, that is, the experience of being the agent of one's action or thought and the feeling that self\u2010productions are intentional and associated with a cognitive experience of voluntary control (Haggard,\u00a0 ). However, only a few studies investigated the relationship between the two processes. In one of them, Subramaniam et al. showed that the reality\u2010monitoring imagination/perception decision was correlated with self\u2010monitoring measures, which provides support for a unitary experience of self\u2010agency resulting from the ability to reliably predict the outcome of self\u2010generated actions (Subramaniam et al.,\u00a0 ). Where and to what extend reality monitoring and self\u2010monitoring processes overlap in the brain remains unknown. \n\nSeveral neuroimaging studies have tried to identify neural substrates of reality monitoring. A qualitative review of imaging studies highlighted the crucial role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and especially its anterior part (amPFC) in distinguishing between the imagined or perceived origin of a signal (Simons et al.,\u00a0 ). Activity in this area, located in the anterior portion of the mPFC, was observed regardless of stimulus type (i.e., voice, faces, objects). Any interpretation of the amPFC as the key structure for reality\u2010monitoring needs to be cautious because most of the included studies reported results that were bound to the scope of an a priori defined region of interest (ROI) in the amPFC. However, a causal role for the mPFC has also been established by using noninvasive brain stimulation to target the mPFC and improve reality\u2010monitoring performance (Subramaniam et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nRegarding self\u2010monitoring, two previous meta\u2010analyses have revealed converging activations in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), including the supramarginal gyrus, the angular gyrus, and the superior temporal gyrus, when confronted with externally derived information (Seghezzi et al.,\u00a0 ; Sperduti et al.,\u00a0 ). Their results when facing self\u2010generated information were more heterogeneous: Seghezzi et al. revealed activations in the left supplementary motor area, left posterior insula, right calcarine scissure, and right cerebellum while Sperduti et al. revealed activations in the bilateral postcentral gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and insula. These conflicting findings can be due to common methodological issues, such as the inclusion of small\u2010volume corrected (SVC) analyses that violate the assumption that all included experiments should be based on the same search and whole\u2010brain coverage. Moreover, their use of the   activation likelihood estimation   approach led them to analyze activations and deactivations in two separate analyses, which may lead to not counteract positive and negative differences in the same brain areas, potentially leading to voxels being detected as increased and decreased at the same time (Radua & Mataix\u2010Cols,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe current study aimed to determine whether reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring recruit overlapping brain regions, thereby allowing us to deepen our understanding of their common underlying cognitive processes. Specifically, this study had three aims:   \nFor the first time, we meta\u2010analyzed the neural substrates of reality\u2010monitoring. We expected that distinguishing imagination\u2010 from perception\u2010derived information would activate the amPFC. \n  \nWe also updated the current knowledge regarding the substrates of self\u2010monitoring using a relatively unbiased meta\u2010analytic approach and strict inclusion criteria. Based on the two previous coordinate\u2010based meta\u2010analyses, we expected modulation of activity in the bilateral temporo\u2010parietal regions. \n  \nThird, we aimed to determine whether reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring are associated with similar activations. Based on previous behavioral studies showing a strong correlation between reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring behavioral scores, we argue that observing such spatial overlap would support the hypothesis of partially shared cognitive mechanisms between these two processes. \n  \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \nThis systematic review was performed according to the recommendations from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\u2010Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al.,\u00a0 ). The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (Chien et al.,\u00a0 ) (registration number: CRD42020204113 on September 29, 2020). \n\n### Search strategy \n  \nThe articles included in the meta\u2010analyses were retrieved using a systematic search strategy. We searched for articles published up until May 2022 without any starting date in the PubMed and ScienceDirect databases. We used the following terms for the reality\u2010monitoring meta\u2010analysis: (\u201csource\u2010monitoring\u201d OR \u201creality\u2010monitoring\u201d OR \u201cself\u2010related\u201d) AND (\u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cPET\u201d OR \u201cpositron emission tomography\u201d OR \u201cneuroimaging\u201d) and the following search terms for the self\u2010monitoring meta\u2010analysis: (\u201cself\u2010monitoring\u201d OR \u201cagency\u201d OR \u201cself\u2010related\u201d) AND (\u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cPET\u201d OR \u201cneuroimaging\u201d). We identified a total of 253 overlapping papers between these two searches. Additional relevant articles were retrieved by up and down ancestry search across all the selected articles. The \u201csimilar articles\u201d function of PubMed was also employed, although no additional references were identified in this manner. Finally, we manually searched through review articles on reality\u2010monitoring, agency, self\u2010judgment, and self\u2010referential thinking to find additional topics falling into our inclusion criteria (Denny et al.,\u00a0 ; Morin & Hamper,\u00a0 ; Seghezzi et al.,\u00a0 ; Simons et al.,\u00a0 ; Sperduti et al.,\u00a0 ; van der Meer et al.,\u00a0 ; van Veluw & Chance,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe detailed process of article selection and the reasons for exclusions are depicted in the PRISMA flowcharts presented in Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\u2010Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram of the literature search for the reality\u2010monitoring (left) and self\u2010monitoring (right) meta\u2010analyses. \n  \n\n### Eligibility \n  \nThe inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) original articles were written in the English language and published in peer\u2010reviewed journals, (ii) healthy volunteers without any established clinical diagnosis of neurological or psychiatric disease were included, (iii) task\u2010related fMRI or PET contrasts were reported, and (iv) studies provided clear information regarding the task and used either the reality\u2010monitoring paradigm (i.e., a paradigm eliciting subjects to judge whether information was previously self\u2010generated or derived from outside) or a self\u2010monitoring paradigm (i.e., a paradigm eliciting subjects to make comparisons between sensory predictions and continuous sensory feedback). Typical reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring paradigms are illustrated in Figure\u00a0 . (v) Concerning the reality\u2010monitoring meta\u2010analysis, neuroimaging explored brain activity during the retrieval phase of the task, (vi) studies conducted direct statistical comparisons between self\u2010 and nonself\u2010conditions (self\u2009>\u2009nonself; self\u2009<\u2009nonself), (vii) studies reported results from whole\u2010brain analyses with full\u2010brain coverage), (viii) studies reported x/y/z coordinates in either standard space, Talairach space or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) spaces, and (ix) studies reported Z\u2010statistics, t\u2010statistics or uncorrected   p  \u2010values. \n  \nExamples of typical reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring paradigms. Reality\u2010monitoring paradigms (left panel) typically consist of an encoding phase, in which participants are confronted with either perceived items or items that must be imagined (in the case of a visual reality\u2010monitoring paradigm, participants see a word and either see a corresponding picture or have to imagine a corresponding mental image). The encoding phase is followed by a retrieval phase, in which participants had to recall whether each item was actually perceived (seen) or only imagined. In typical self\u2010monitoring paradigms (right panel), participants perform a movement while receiving either congruent (e.g., visual feedback of their own movement) or incongruent feedback (e.g., visual feedback of a distorted movement). Participants are either asked to judge whether the movement was their own or not, or, in the case of implicit paradigms, no response is requested. \n  \nThe exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) studies explored brain activity only during the encoding phase of the reality\u2010monitoring paradigm, (ii) studies used SVC analyses, (iii) studies only reported ROI analysis, (iv) studies used data from subjects already included in other studies, (v) studies included fewer than five healthy subjects, and (vi) studies reporting other statistical comparisons (e.g., misattribution of the source vs. correct attribution). \n\nDecisions on inclusion and data extraction were made independently by two authors (LL and MM). \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nFor each selected article, the following demographic and task\u2010related information was extracted: sample size, gender, and age of subjects, imaging modality (fMRI or PET), detailed description of the design and the task used, and pertinent contrasts (  see   Table\u00a0 , Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). Regarding gender information, it may be mentioned that several studies did not clearly report the number of male and female after exclusion of participants. For each dataset, we extracted x/y/z coordinates and Z\u2010 or t\u2010statistics or uncorrected   p  \u2010values (see Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). Aggregated data were shared on the Open Science Framework ( ). We also reported several MRI\u2010related acquisition and analysis parameters: the fMRI design (event\u2010related or block), the magnetic field strength, the number of acquired slices, slice thickness and gap, the field of view, the matrix size, the software used for analysis (SPM, FSL or other) and its version, the reference space (MNI or TAL), smoothing kernel, and the statistical threshold used (see Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nCharacteristics of the studies included in the reality\u2010monitoring (upper panel) and self\u2010monitoring (lower panel) meta\u2010analyses. \n    \n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nA quality assessment score was also calculated based on the criteria used in the study by Tian et al. ( ) and the guidelines for reporting an fMRI study by Poldrack et al. ( ). The final checklist included 18 items evaluating, among other things, the subject sample, design specification, data acquisition, data preprocessing, statistical analyses, and reporting of conclusions (see Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Seed\u2010based d mapping \n  \nData were analyzed using seed\u2010based d mapping software (formerly   Signed Differential Mapping  ) with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM\u2010PSI, version 6.21,  ). This voxel\u2010based method allowed us to summarize peak coordinates and statistical t\u2010maps from the multiple included studies to produce a whole\u2010brain summary of brain activity associated with self\u2010agency and had been extensively validated by previous meta\u2010analyses (Albajes\u2010Eizagirre, Solanes, & Radua,\u00a0 ; Albajes\u2010Eizagirre, Solanes, Vieta, & Radua,\u00a0 ; Radua & Mataix\u2010Cols,\u00a0 ; Radua, Mataix\u2010Cols, et al.,\u00a0 ; Radua, Rubia, et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nSDM\u2010PSI imputes the brain maps of statistical effects for each included study to conduct a standard random\u2010effect meta\u2010analysis that tests whether the effects are different from zero. This method was mainly chosen in the current study because it offers the key advantages of accounting for effect sizes and analyzing both positive and negative peaks in the same map, to counteract the effects of studies reporting opposite activation findings in the same areas (Radua & Mataix\u2010Cols,\u00a0 ). These properties have previously been shown to enhance the balance between the false and positive rate and increase reliability, particularly with a small number of included studies in the meta\u2010analysis (Bossier et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe procedure includes four main steps: data preparation, preprocessing, mean analysis, and complementary analyses (heterogeneity and publication bias analyses).   \nDuring data preparation, Z\u2010values were first converted into t\u2010values with the SDM statistics converter ( ). Then, coordinates and t\u2010values were written in separate text files to be extracted by SDM. The t\u2010values obtained from the analysis of the \u201cself\u2009<\u2009nonself\u201d contrast were added with a negative sign corresponding to deactivation. \n  \nThen, data were preprocessed to convert t\u2010values for each peak of activation into Hedges'   g   effect size and their associated variance, thereby obtaining the maximum likely maps of the lower and upper bounds of potential effect sizes for each study. \n  \nDuring the main analysis, SDM allowed us to calculate the mean of the voxel values in the different studies. Hedge's g\u2010corrected effect sizes were calculated at the group level, and a random model was run with each study weighted by its variance and between\u2010study heterogeneity. Finally, the family\u2010wise error (FWE) rate was applied to correct for multiple comparisons. The default setting of 1000 permutations has been kept. The distribution of the maximum statistics obtained was then used to threshold the meta\u2010analysis images, resulting in a corrected   p  \u2010value map. \n  \nFinally, heterogeneity was studied by analyzing a map of   I   statistics and potential publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's tests.   I   values are typically categorized as low, moderate, and high for values of 25, 50, and 75%, respectively. \n  \n\nWe reported results using an uncorrected   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 threshold with a cluster extent\u2009=\u200920 voxels (Lieberman & Cunningham,\u00a0 ; Radua, Borgwardt, et al.,\u00a0 ; Radua, Mataix\u2010Cols, et al.,\u00a0 ). We also reported using FWE\u2010corrected   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 using the threshold\u2010free cluster enhancement (TFCE) approach (Dugr\u00e9 et al.,\u00a0 ; Smith & Nichols,\u00a0 ). The use of two statistical thresholds is common in SDM meta\u2010analyses. A simulation comparing the results of meta\u2010analyses and mega\u2010analyses on the same data showed that the \u201cliberal\u201d uncorrected threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 optimally balance false\u2010positive and false\u2010negative rates (Radua, Mataix\u2010Cols, et al.,\u00a0 ) and is thus recommended (M\u00fcller et al.,\u00a0 ). An extent threshold of 20 voxels was applied, which is stricter than the threshold suggested by Radua et al. to exclude smaller clusters. TFCE FWE\u2010corrected results were reported to increase the specificity\u2010to\u2010sensitivity ratio. The corrected results as well as the reported effect\u2010sizes should be taken in consideration to judge the strength of evidence of a true effect (M\u00fcller et al.,\u00a0 ). All activations/deactivations were reported in the MNI space. The regions listed in the results tables were labeled using the SDM stereotactic space (Radua, Grau, et al.,\u00a0 ; Thiebaut de Schotten, Dell'Acqua, et al.,\u00a0 ; Thiebaut de Schotten, Ffytche, et al.,\u00a0 ) and the SPM12 Anatomy Toolbox v3.0 (Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nBased on our aims and predictions, we carried out two sets of analyses:   \nWe performed separate meta\u2010analyses to examine the neural substrate of both reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring paradigms. \n  \nWe conducted a conjunction analysis between the meta\u2010analytical map of reality\u2010monitoring and that of self\u2010monitoring using the multimodal analysis function (Radua et al.,\u00a0 ) of SDM\u2010PSI to identify regions that were associated with both reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring. \n  \n\n\n### Reliability analyses \n  \nTo test the robustness of the results, a jackknife sensitivity procedure was conducted (Radua & Mataix\u2010Cols,\u00a0 ). This analysis was carried out by successively repeating the mean analysis as many times as studies were included but discarding one different individual study at a time. Findings were considered highly replicable when significant brain regions remained significant in all the included studies. \n\n\n### Supplemental analysis: Comparison between paradigms \n  \nWe conducted a supplemental analysis that directly compares changes in activity between reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring studies. Results were reported using an uncorrected   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 threshold with a cluster extent\u2009=\u200920 voxels. \n\n\n### Supplemental analysis: Controlling the potential confounding \n  \nThe potential influence of age and study quality on estimated activations/deactivations was further explored by meta\u2010regression using a linear random\u2010effect model. Results were considered statistically significant at FWE\u2010corrected a conservative threshold of   p  \u2009=\u2009.005 to reduce the risk of type 1 error related to multiple testing and minimize the detection of spurious relationships. Only brain regions also found in the main meta\u2010analyses were considered. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nAfter the selection process and removal of duplicates, 9 studies met the criteria for inclusion in the reality\u2010monitoring meta\u2010analysis, including a total of 172 subjects. Then, 12 studies met the criteria for inclusion in the self\u2010monitoring meta\u2010analysis, including a total of 192 subjects. \n\n### Brain responses associated with reality\u2010monitoring \n  \nThe SDM meta\u2010analysis revealed significant activations associated with reality\u2010monitoring (self\u2009>\u2009nonself) in the lobule VI of the left cerebellum, the right medial superior frontal gyrus (BA 10, amPFC) and the left supramarginal gyrus (BA 48) (see Table\u00a0 , Figure\u00a0 ). Results also revealed significant deactivations in the right anterior thalamic projections, the left median cingulate gyrus (BA 23), the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45), the left precuneus (BA 7), the left caudate nucleus, the left supplementary motor area (BA 6), and the left fusiform gyrus (BA 37). Only the deactivation in the right anterior thalamic projections survived to FWE\u2010correction. This peak was associated with low between\u2010study heterogeneity (  I  \u2009=\u20090.62%). Egger's test results and funnel plot observations suggested that none of results were driven by publication bias (  p  \u2009=\u2009.53) (see Supplementary Figure\u00a0 ). Finally, no significant effect was observed between our results and moderators (age, quality of the study, see Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). Robustness analyses indicated that these findings were consistent in most studies (see Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nSignificant activation/deactivation for the reality\u2010monitoring meta\u2010analysis (Self > nonself contrast). \n      \nSignificant brain functional activations and deactivations associated with reality\u2010monitoring (self\u2009>\u2009nonself) estimated by a whole\u2010brain meta\u2010analysis. The results are displayed based on the uncorrected threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 (minimum cluster size\u2009=\u200920 voxels) and overlaid on sagittal and axial sections of a normalized canonical template brain (ch2better) using MRIcron software. Coordinates are reported in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The intensity color scale indicates Z\u2010score values (colors should be used for Figure\u00a0  to print). \n  \n\n### Brain responses associated with self\u2010monitoring \n  \nThe SDM meta\u2010analysis revealed significant activations associated with self\u2010monitoring (self\u2009>\u2009nonself) in the bilateral cerebellum, hemispheric lobule VI, the left supramarginal and postcentral gyrus (BA 48), the corpus callosum, the right supplementary motor area (BA 6), the right caudate nucleus, and the left thalamic projections (see Table\u00a0 ). The results also revealed significant deactivations in the right supramarginal gyrus (BA 40), the right precuneus, the left anterior cingulate and medial superior frontal gyrus (BA 32), the left inferior parietal gyrus (BA 40), the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 48), the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44), the right anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri (BA 11), and the right middle temporal gyrus (BA 48) (see Figure\u00a0 ). The activation in the left cerebellum, hemispheric lobule VI, and the left postcentral gyrus (BA 48) survived to FWE\u2010correction, as well as the deactivation in the right supramarginal gyrus (BA 40), the left anterior cingulate and medial superior frontal gyrus (BA 32), the right precuneus, and the left inferior parietal gyrus (BA 40). \n  \nSignificant activation/deactivation for the self\u2010monitoring meta\u2010analysis (Self > nonself contrast). \n      \nSignificant brain functional activations and deactivations associated with self\u2010monitoring (self\u2009>\u2009nonself) estimated by a whole\u2010brain meta\u2010analysis. The results are displayed based on the uncorrected threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 (minimum cluster size\u2009=\u200920 voxels) and overlaid on sagittal and axial sections of a normalized canonical template brain (ch2better) using MRIcron software. Coordinates are reported in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The intensity color scale indicates Z\u2010score values (colors should be used for Figure\u00a0  to print). \n  \nLow between\u2010study heterogeneity has been associated with each significant peak (  I  \u2009=\u20093.23\u20136.71%). Egger's test results and funnel plot observations suggested that none of results were driven by publication bias (  p  \u2009=\u2009.14\u2013.52) (see Supplementary Figure\u00a0 ). No significant effect was observed between our results and moderators (age and quality of the study, see Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). Robustness analyses indicated that these findings were consistent in most studies (see Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Overlap between reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring brain reactivity \n  \nWe finally performed a conjunction analysis to identify the overlapping brain regions between both self\u2010monitoring and reality\u2010monitoring meta\u2010analytic statistical maps. Results revealed significant activation of the left cerebellum, lobule VI in the self\u2009>\u2009nonself contrast in both paradigms of self\u2010agency (see Table\u00a0 , Figure\u00a0 ). This finding was not detectable after FWE\u2010correction. The coordinates of this part of the cerebellum were used to extract a mask from the two main analyses. Activation in this region was associated with similar effect size and low heterogeneity in both self\u2010monitoring and reality\u2010monitoring (Hedge's   g  \u2009=\u20090.36 and 0.40,   I  \u2009=\u20091.08 and 19.17%, respectively). \n  \nSignificant activation/deactivation for the conjunction meta\u2010analysis between reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring. \n      \nSignificant brain functional activations reflecting the overlap between reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring whole\u2010brain meta\u2010analyses. The results are displayed based on the uncorrected threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 (minimum cluster size\u2009=\u200920 voxels) and overlaid on sagittal and axial sections of a normalized canonical template brain (ch2better) using MRIcron software. Coordinates are reported in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The intensity color scale indicates Z\u2010score values (colors should be used for Figure\u00a0  to print). \n  \n\n### Supplemental analysis results: Comparison between paradigms \n  \nThe direct comparison between reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring studies reports significantly more deactivation in the right anterior thalamic projections in reality\u2010monitoring studies compared to self\u2010monitoring studies. The contrast analysis also revealed significantly more deactivation in the right supramarginal gyrus, the right anterior cingulate gyri and the right precuneus in self\u2010monitoring studies compared to reality\u2010monitoring studies (see Table\u00a0 , Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nSignificant results of the comparison between reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring studies (Self\u2010monitoring > Reality\u2010monitoring contrast). \n      \nSignificant brain functional activations reflecting the difference between reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring whole\u2010brain meta\u2010analyses (Self\u2010monitoring > Reality\u2010monitoring contrast). The results are displayed based on the uncorrected threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 (minimum cluster size\u2009=\u200920 voxels) and overlaid on sagittal and axial sections of a normalized canonical template brain (ch2better) using MRIcron software. Coordinates are reported in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The intensity color scale indicates Z\u2010score values (colors should be used for Figure\u00a0  to print). \n  \n\n### Supplemental analysis results: Controlling for confounders \n  \nThe study quality had no significant influence on the functional results in either self\u2010monitoring or reality\u2010monitoring. Higher age was significantly associated with activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44) and the right supplementary area during the self\u2010monitoring paradigm (see Supplementary Table 8). None of these brain regions overlapped with areas that survived FWE\u2010correction. Finally, age had no significant influence on the reality\u2010monitoring results (see Supplementary Table 7). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nWhile self\u2010 and reality\u2010monitoring conceptually overlaps in the sense that they both involve distinguishing self from nonself origins of information, the two concepts remain largely separate cognitive fields; moreover, their common brain substrates have received relatively little attention. Using a coordinate\u2010based meta\u2010analysis, we compiled and analyzed results from imaging studies investigating the brain correlates of either reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring and examined their overlapping neural responses. We identified specific brain regions involved in reality\u2010monitoring and confirmed the central role played by the bilateral IPL in self\u2010monitoring (Seghezzi et al.,\u00a0 ; Sperduti et al.,\u00a0 ). Importantly, our findings suggest consistent activation of the lobule VI of the left cerebellum in both reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring. \n\n### Brain areas involved in reality\u2010monitoring \n  \nOur meta\u2010analysis revealed that the right amPFC is consistently activated during reality\u2010monitoring. Its activation has been shown using a liberal statistical threshold (i.e.,   p  \u2009<\u2009.005, uncorrected, minimal cluster size >20) but not when using a conservative threshold (i.e.,   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 FWE\u2010corrected). That being said, this activation is highly consistent with a large corpus of studies showing that the amPFC exhibits differential activity during the retrieval of internally vs. externally generated information using a ROI approach (for review, Simons et al.,\u00a0 ). All the studies that were bound to the scope of an a priori ROI were excluded from the present meta\u2010analysis. However, these studies demonstrated that the amPFC modulates its activity during a more diverse range of reality\u2010monitoring tasks that those we included, using verbal items, but also faces and objects (Dobbins & Wagner,\u00a0 ; Kensinger & Schacter,\u00a0 ; Simons, Gilbert, et al.,\u00a0 ; Simons, Owen, et al.,\u00a0 ). Our findings are also in line with interventional studies using neurofeedback or brain stimulation that have shown the causal involvement of amPFC in reality\u2010monitoring (Garrison et al.,\u00a0 ; Subramaniam et al.,\u00a0 ). Here, the activation of the amPFC during reality\u2010monitoring but not self\u2010monitoring suggests its specific role in attributing the source of memories through the distinction between the retrieval of their internal and external features. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the amPFC plays a higher\u2010order role of evaluation of low\u2010level sensory signals and cognitive control aspects of perception and imagination in order to make a source attribution (Dijkstra et al.,\u00a0 ). At the structural level, the reduction in length in the paracingulate sulcus (PCS), a tertiary sulcus surrounding the ACC, is associated with reduced reality\u2010monitoring performance (Buda et al.,\u00a0 ; Fornito et al.,\u00a0 ). The pathological implication of this structural variability has been shown in patients with schizophrenia, for whom the reduction in PCS length is associated with hallucinations (Garrison et al.,\u00a0 ) and deficits of reality monitoring (Perret et al.,\u00a0 ). If the relationship between brain morphometry and functional activity remains unclear, the cortical folding may influence the functional involvement of the amPFC and ACC during reality\u2010monitoring. Our meta\u2010analysis also identified a specific activation in the left SMG. However, this activation was associated with 16% of heterogeneity, only concerned a small number of voxels and did not survive to FWE\u2010correction. Finally, the only cluster surviving to FWE\u2010correction has peaks in the right anterior thalamic projections. Its specific role in the self versus nonself distinction should be further explored. Given the crucial projection from the anterior thalamus to the anterior cingulate cortex within the Papez circuit supporting neural substrates of memory (Jankowski et al.,  ; Papez,\u00a0 ), future studies should pay particular attention to their functional connectivity during reality\u2010monitoring. \n\n\n### Brain areas involved in self\u2010monitoring \n  \nConcerning self\u2010monitoring, we identified activations in the left cerebellum and postcentral gyrus and deactivations in the right supramarginal gyrus and the left anterior cingulate and the medial superior frontal gyrus. The deactivation of the right SMG corroborates the findings of Seghezzi et al. ( ) and Sperduti et al. ( ). Substantiating its pivotal role in self versus nonself distinction, hyperactivity of the right IPL in response to self\u2010generated events is correlated with symptoms that include delusion of alien control, insertion\u2010of\u2010thought experiences, and hallucinations in schizophrenia patients (Jardri, Pouchet, et al.,\u00a0 ; Spence et al.,\u00a0 ). Furthermore, a distinct sulcal pattern distribution of the Sylvian fissure, a sulcus surrounding the right IPL, has been observed in patients with schizophrenia who misattribute their hallucinations to an external source compared to patients who recognize that they originate from their own thoughts (Plaze et al.,\u00a0 ). One can assume that such anatomical variability in pathological condition gives an indication as to the functional role of the right IPL in disentangling the origin of online information. But how would the deactivation of the right IPL participate in self\u2010monitoring? Interestingly, the right IPL is involved in various tasks, such as go/no go, false\u2010belief reasoning, and theory of mind, which also require online comparison between internal predictions and external perceived events (Decety & Lamm,\u00a0 ; Rothmayr et al.,\u00a0 ). As a core region of the ventral frontoparietal network, the right SMG is indeed engaged in attention reorienting from an internal model to externally directed information in the context of a violation of expectations (Corbetta et al.,\u00a0 ). Moreover, as a part of the secondary somatosensory cortex, the right SMG receives strong connections from sensory and motor areas such as the left postcentral gyrus and has specifically been involved in attentional modulation of somatosensory stimuli (Chen et al.,\u00a0 ; Fujiwara et al.,\u00a0 ; H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen et al.,\u00a0 ). Hence, the right SMG deactivation during self\u2010monitoring could reflect the sensory dampening observed in the context of self\u2010generated action and lead to maintaining or redirecting attention toward internally generated stimuli. Our meta\u2010analysis also confirms the findings of Sperduti et al. and Seghezzi et al. on the key role of the left IPL for external agency during self\u2010monitoring. This region has previously been associated with the detection of incongruent feedback during action execution (Balslev et al.,\u00a0 ). In schizophrenia patients, hyperactivation of the left IPL during self\u2010monitoring is associated with false signaling of incongruence and passivity symptoms, characterizing the experience of believing that one's thoughts or actions are controlled by an external agent (Frith,\u00a0 ; Schnell et al.,\u00a0 ). One could then assume that the left IPL deactivation reflects the absence of conflict in the event of congruence between the predicted and actual feedback of self\u2010generated action. Our cytoarchitectonic analysis further specified the localization of this deactivation in the hIP2 region of the left IPL, displaying strong functional connectivity with the right SMG and the left superior frontal gyrus (Uddin et al.,\u00a0 ), which also deactivate during the self versus nonself distinction. The latter is also involved in conflictual decision making: the left superior frontal gyrus and ACC are specifically associated with confusion between imagined and perceived pictures (Gonsalves et al.,\u00a0 ; Stephan\u2010Otto, Siddi, Senior, Cuevas\u2010Esteban, et al.,\u00a0 ) and their disruption is associated with deficits in error\u2010monitoring in schizophrenia patients (Alain et al.,\u00a0 ; Mathalon et al.,\u00a0 ). In the context of self\u2010agency, this suggests that the left superior frontal gyrus and ACC act conjointly with the left IPL in monitoring the conflicts between predicted and observed stimuli. \n\n\n### Functional convergence between reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring: Is the lobule   VI   of the cerebellum a key structure for self\u2010agency? \n  \nThe conjunction analysis between reality\u2010monitoring and self\u2010monitoring has revealed robust common activation of the left lobule VI of the cerebellum. This activation further corroborates the   cerebellar forward model  , indicating that self\u2010generated productions lead the cerebellum to generate sensory predictions (Pinheiro et al.,\u00a0 ; Sokolov et al.,\u00a0 ). After finding a selective response of the lobule VI when tactile stimuli were self\u2010produced, Blakemore et al. assumed for the first time that the cerebellum receives an efference copy of motor commands to build the prediction of their somatosensory consequences (Blakemore et al.,\u00a0 ). The generation of the expected sensory outcome has been hypothesized to then reduce the activity of the implicated sensory areas. For instance, amplitude reduction of the N1 event\u2010related response and reduced BOLD activity of the auditory cortex after voice onset seem to reflect a match between self\u2010generated motor\u2010to\u2010auditory prediction and actual sensory feedback (Baess et al.,\u00a0 ,  ; Christoffels et al.,\u00a0 ; Numminen et al.,\u00a0 ; Sato & Shiller,\u00a0 ). Such a role of cerebrocerebellar pathways has been demonstrated by studies reporting patients with cerebellar lesions to not display any N100 suppression after a self\u2010generated sound (Knolle et al.,\u00a0 ,  ). In the same way, actions with predictable visual consequences are associated with BOLD suppression in visual cortices and greater cerebellar\u2010visual cortex connectivity than actions with unpredictable visual consequences (Straube et al.,\u00a0 ). Furthermore, several fMRI studies highlighted the role of the cerebellum during language prediction (Lesage et al.,\u00a0 ; Moberget et al.,\u00a0 ) and used neurostimulation to demonstrate causality between cerebellum activation and the ability to anticipate words in a sentence (D'Mello et al.,\u00a0 ; Lesage et al.,\u00a0 ; Miall et al.,\u00a0 ). In a subsequent study, Blakemore et al. also found the lobule VI to modulate its activity when increasing the delay between a hand's movement and the resulting tactile stimulation of a passive hand, suggesting that this region should constantly compare expected and actual sensory feedback to detect potential discrepancies (Blakemore et al.,\u00a0 ). In response to mismatches, an error signal from the cerebellum would update the   forward model   by reducing the sensory suppression of the implicated sensory areas (Pinheiro et al.,\u00a0 ). If activation of lobule VI of the cerebellum during online self\u2010agency is highly coherent with the cerebellum forward model, our results suggest that this region reactivates when remembering the self\u2010provenance of information during the reality\u2010monitoring retrieval phase. Previous studies implicated the cerebellum in both the encoding and retrieval aspects of episodic memory (i.e., the ability to recollect a specific personal experience, including the context) and in the acquisition and retention of motor memories (Herzfeld et al.,\u00a0 ) using plasticity mechanisms (Andreasen et al.,\u00a0 ; D'Angelo,\u00a0 ; Fliessbach et al.,\u00a0 ; Fossati et al.,\u00a0 ; Hirano,\u00a0 ; Ito,\u00a0 ). The cerebellum has been more specifically identified as a part of a neural network activated during source memory relative to object memory (Hawco et al.,\u00a0 ), and lesions in this structure are associated with repeated misattributions between the self and the external origin of a memory (Tamagni et al.,\u00a0 ). Based on its overlapping activation in self\u2010monitoring and reality\u2010monitoring, we hypothesized that the cerebellum plays a key role in the feed\u2010forward model and as a \u201ccognitive cue\u201d to identify the self\u2010origin of stored information. \n\n\n### Integrating the cerebellar forward model and the reality\u2010monitoring framework \n  \nThe feed\u2010forward model accounting for the recognition of self\u2010generated productions proposes that the outgoing motor signal is accompanied by a replicate called the efference copy, and the integration of this replicate results in building a prediction of the sensory feedback. This prediction minimizes the sensory perception of our own actions or speech. In addition, a constant comparison between the prediction and the actual sensory input would allow the detection of potential discrepancies to update the forward model. What would be the neurobiological substrates of such a model? First, our results support the claim that the lobule VI of the cerebellum is a pivotal neural locus for recognizing self\u2010produced behaviors. According to this view, the cerebellum might integrate the efference copy of self\u2010productions to generate an expectation of sensory feedback, which would then transit by cerebello\u2010cortical connections to prepare the sensory areas for incoming sensory feedback. This sensory attenuation would be underpinned by the deactivation of somatosensory regions such as the left postcentral gyrus and the right SMG. In this way, the connectivity between lobule VI of the cerebellum and the right SMG has been suggested to support somatosensory attenuation in the context of self\u2010generated action (Kilteni & Ehrsson,\u00a0 ). Moreover, deactivation in the right TPJ would in turn lead to alleviate the accuracy of future expectations by maintaining or reallocating attention to internally generated stimuli. In the event of a mismatch between the expected and actual sensory feedback, an error signal would transit again from the cerebellum to the primary sensory cortices and motor areas to reduce the sensory attenuation and update the motor command, respectively. The difference between expected and actual sensory feedback would then be propagated to other hierarchical levels, such as the left IPL and ACC, involved in error processing and contributing to altered sense of agency. Within the   reality\u2010monitoring framework  , our meta\u2010analysis finally advocates for a reactivation of the lobule VI cerebellum during the retrieval phase of reality\u2010monitoring to reinstate the encoding context in collaboration with the amPFC. The amPFC would then integrate and evaluate the retrieved markers of the cognitive operations associated with thought, speech, and other actions to attribute its source. \n\nSeveral limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, even with a total of 172 individuals, we could only include 9 reality\u2010monitoring studies. Most of the studies mentioned in the Simons et al.'s review (Simons et al.,\u00a0 ) have not been included in this quantitative meta\u2010analysis. Several of these studies have only reported ROI\u2010based analyses in the amPFC (Brandt et al.,\u00a0 ; Simons et al.,\u00a0 ,  ; Vinogradov et al.,\u00a0 ). The inclusion of experiments from different original search coverage would inflate the significance for the amPFC (M\u00fcller et al.,\u00a0 ). Another portion of these studies reported the involvement of the amPFC in reality\u2010monitoring using heterogeneous contrasts that we excluded from the present meta\u2010analysis (e.g., misattributions of the source vs. correct attribution (Kensinger & Schacter,\u00a0 ), correct recognition of the source status vs. baseline (Simons et al.,\u00a0 )). Of note, Simons et al.'s paper is not a systematic review and most of the studies of reality\u2010monitoring in healthy subjects using fMRI that we included in the present meta\u2010analysis are not mentioned in their review. Second, due to the number of included studies, we were not able to subcategorize the experiments according to the modality of the stimulus (i.e., action, imagery, verbal tasks). Regarding the amPFC, previous studies adopting an ROI approach have shown a similar activation of the amPFC in imagery and verbal studies, suggesting that this region is involved in reality\u2010monitoring regardless of the modality. In the self\u2010monitoring meta\u2010analysis, only two studies used verbal tasks (Jardri et al.,\u00a0 ; Jardri, Pins, et al.,\u00a0 ). However, heterogeneity tests did not reveal any significant between\u2010study variance that could have indicated a verbal versus action difference. Nonetheless, comparing subgroups according to the stimulus dimension is certainly the most thorough way of controlling this potential confounder. Currently, the complete lack of whole\u2010brain fMRI reality\u2010monitoring contrasts using action stimuli and the small number of neuroimaging studies using verbal self\u2010monitoring contrasts prevent us from employing this kind of rigorous standard. A third limitation of the current study is the uncertainty about the inclusion of the cerebellum in whole\u2010brain analyses. Out of the 16 included studies, 4 did not reveal activation in this structure or specify whether their whole\u2010brain analysis covered the structure (Lundstrom et al.,\u00a0 ; Renes et al.,\u00a0 ; Subramaniam et al.,\u00a0 ; Takahashi et al.,\u00a0 ). Consequently, for these four studies, the lack of signal in the cerebellum may be considered a potential false negative. However, our meta\u2010analysis showed that the most substantial and consistent activation in the cerebellum occurred in response to self\u2010generated information; therefore, the only risk of bias might be a slight underestimation of the effect size. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to investigate self\u2010agency by systematically including the cerebellum in their whole\u2010brain coverage, and these works should specify whether the structure is included in the analyses. Fourth, we reported results with a statistical threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 (uncorrected, minimal cluster size >20). Although SDM developers demonstrated that the liberal threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 optimally balances sensitivity and specificity (Radua, Mataix\u2010Cols, et al.,\u00a0 ) and this threshold has been mostly used in meta\u2010analyses of neuroimaging studies, it remains an approximation of the corrected results. When using a more conservative threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 (FWE\u2010corrected), the amPFC activation did not survive in the reality\u2010monitoring meta\u2010analysis and the conjunction meta\u2010analysis yielded no significant results. This could be due to several reasons: (a) even with a total number of 172 subjects included in the reality\u2010monitoring meta\u2010analysis, only nine studies were included, (b) the heterogeneity between verbal reality\u2010monitoring studies and action self\u2010monitoring studies could have reduced our ability to observe results surviving conservative thresholding, and (c) coordinate\u2010based meta\u2010analyses are susceptible to threshold bias (we were not able to ask for unthresholded maps because most of the included studies were published more than 10\u2009years ago). We reported results with both thresholded and unthresholded   p  \u2010values to move beyond p\u2010value and discussed the amPFC activation in the light of the converging evidence from numerous ROI studies showing its consistent involvement in reality\u2010monitoring. Concerning the conjunction meta\u2010analysis, we supplemented the unthresholded   p  \u2010values by extracting masks that allowed us to report similar moderate effect\u2010sizes in the cerebellum peak for both self\u2010monitoring and reality\u2010monitoring meta\u2010analyses. A last caveat of this study is the inclusion of slightly heterogeneous contrasts in the reality\u2010monitoring meta\u2010analysis. Seven over nine studies reported a self versus nonself contrast regardless the correct identification of the source. Two studies (Stephan\u2010Otto, Siddi, Senior, Mu\u00f1oz\u2010Samons, et al.,\u00a0 ; Takahashi et al.,\u00a0 ), however, reported the contrast between correctly remembered self\u2010generated items and correctly remembered nonself\u2010generated items. We tested the robustness of our results by replicating our meta\u2010analysis while excluding these studies and showed no difference with the original meta\u2010analysis. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nBased on the common cognitive substrate of reality\u2010 and self\u2010monitoring, we adopted a metanalytic approach to investigate the brain regions that are involved in either of these two paradigms and performed conjunction analysis to highlight their overlaps. Our results suggest that the lobule VI of the cerebellum is consistently engaged in both reality\u2010 and self\u2010monitoring. This finding is highly consistent with the   cerebellar forward model  , in which the cerebellum plays a key role in generating the predicted feedback of our own actions and producing an error signal in the event of a mismatch with the actual sensory feedback. During self\u2010monitoring, the cerebellum would act together with cerebral regions including the right TPJ and left IPL and ACC. When remembering the self\u2010origin of information at the retrieval phase of reality\u2010monitoring, the cerebellum would reactivate within a set of brain regions including the right amPFC and anterior thalamic projections. Because the exact functions of these structures remain highly speculative, our results set the rationale for future imaging and brain stimulation studies that may explore their contribution to self\u2010agency. Finally, this study has far\u2010reaching implications for a better understanding of altered reality\u2010monitoring in the context of schizophrenia, in which patients experience a severe blurring of the self/nonself\u2010distinction and confusion between self\u2010generated stimuli and those they perceive from the environment (Brookwell et al.,\u00a0 ; Waters et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nLayla Lavall\u00e9: Conceptualization, methodology, formal analysis, visualization, writing \u2013 original draft, writing \u2013 review and editing.

This fMRI study assessed the extent to which early adolescents (  n   = 39, ages 12\u201314) conform to their parents\u2019 and peers\u2019 conflicting attitudes toward different types of behavior (unconstructive and constructive) and in response to different types of influence (negative and positive). Overall, adolescents exhibited low rates of conformity, sticking with their pre-existing attitudes 65 % of the time. When they did conform, adolescents were more likely to conform to their peers\u2019 attitudes towards constructive than unconstructive behaviors, exhibiting decreased activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and inferior frontal gyrus during peer conformity toward constructive over unconstructive behaviors. Adolescents were also more likely to conform when their parents and peers endorsed relatively more positive influence than negative influence, exhibiting increased activation in the temporoparietal junction when considering conforming to negative over positive influence. These results highlight early adolescents\u2019 ability to stick with their own opinions when confronted with opposing attitudes and conform selectively based on the social context. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nLearning how to balance being themselves and fitting in with their social group can be particularly challenging during adolescence, a developmental period during which the need to establish a unique identity coincides with the desire to find belonging within social groups ( ;  ). What determines if and when adolescents resist or conform to social pressures? When there are potential conflicts between their own and others\u2019 opinions, adolescents may need to weigh the decision to stick with their pre-existing attitudes (i.e., resist) against the potentially beneficial effects of shifting their attitudes toward group norms (i.e., conform) ( ). When they do conform, adolescents are highly attuned to the social context in which social influence unfolds, flexibly shifting their attitudes toward the person or behavior that is most salient for that decision context ( ;  ). Parents and peers are two important sources of influence that shape everyday attitudes and behaviors during adolescence, but their relative influence changes based on both external factors (e.g., type of behavior at hand) ( ;  ) and internal factors (e.g., personal values toward a behavior) ( ). What remains unknown, however, is the underlying neurocognitive processes that guide decisions to conform across different social contexts, particularly when adolescents are confronted with parent and peer opinions that differ from their own. \n\nPrevailing conceptions of adolescence suggest conformity is monolithic and unidimensional, such that youth will be excessively susceptible, particularly to negative influences from their peers ( ;  ;  ). However, this perspective may be oversimplified because prior research has mostly examined social influence in isolation, focusing on only one type of influence or type of behavior ( ;  ;  ). In addition, the absence or attenuation of unconstructive behaviors (e.g., less reckless driving) is often conflated with the positive effects of social influence, such as the encouragement of constructive behaviors (e.g., driving safely in peer contexts) ( ), with few studies comparing social influence on both constructive and unconstructive behaviors (but see  ). This constrains our ability to assess how conformity decisions unfold across a wide range of social contexts, thereby perpetuating negative stereotypes of adolescence that may inadvertently shape future attitudes and behaviors ( ). \n\nValue-based decision making models provide a useful conceptual framework for understanding how conformity decisions may be driven by neural signals that encode the motivational value of various stimuli from the environment ( ;  ). The brain\u2019s valuation system, which includes the ventromedial and orbital subregions of the prefrontal cortex (vmPFC, OFC) and striatum, has been hypothesized to compute the subjective value of possible choices before determining the most valued option to enact in a given context ( ;  ). Insofar as the decision to conform represents a value-based choice, the relative value of a set of choices (e.g., conform or resist) is compared before selecting the choice that is most valued and consistent with the goal at hand. Indeed, increased activity of the ventral striatum and OFC is associated with greater value-guided choices in adolescents relative to adults ( ) and predicts the extent to which adolescents adopt others\u2019 attitudes as their own ( ,  ;  ). Importantly, such value-based computations vary across individuals and social contexts. \n\nThe extent to which social information from others is salient to an individual\u2019s self-interests and social goals can change the value of conformity decisions ( ). Indeed, a recent meta-analysis found that decision making in social contexts not only robustly recruits the vmPFC and ventral striatum, but also the dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), insula/inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and, depending on the social context, other regions implicated in social cognition (e.g., temporoparietal junction (TPJ), posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS)) ( ). The so-called mentalizing brain network, which includes the dmPFC, TPJ, and pSTS, is involved in simulating the mental states of others ( ), with individual differences in TPJ and pSTS activation positively associated with adolescents\u2019 susceptibility to peer influence across social contexts ( ;  ). The insula, dACC, and IFG are commonly involved in encoding the salience of internal and external cues that motivate and regulate behavior ( ), including monitoring cognitive inconsistencies between one\u2019s own and others\u2019 choices ( ;  ). For example, dACC activity increases when individuals\u2019 opinions conflict with the group opinion, which predicts subsequent adjustment of behavior ( ;  ). Collectively, neural processes related to valuation, mentalizing, and salience monitoring may support how adolescents balance self- and social-relevant considerations during conformity decisions. \n\n\n## Current study \n  \nThe aim of the current study was to examine how conformity decisions are evaluated in the developing brain and unfold across social contexts, particularly when adolescents\u2019 own opinions conflict with the opinions of their parents, peers, or both. We focus on early adolescence (12\u201314 years), a developmental period marked by increased susceptibility to both antisocial and prosocial influence ( ;  ), significant changes in the salience of parent and peer relationships ( ), and a social reorientation of the brain that renders social contexts particularly salient ( ;  ). To probe the neurocognitive processes underlying decisions to conform toward conflicting influence, early adolescents completed an experimental task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan, in which they were shown parent and peer attitudes that conflicted with their own attitudes and were instructed to indicate who they agree with. We manipulated the social influence in two ways so that we could examine whether participants conform (1) to their parents\u2019 or peers\u2019 attitudes toward constructive (e.g., working hard in school) versus (vs.) unconstructive (e.g., smoking a cigarette) behaviors and (2) when their parents and peers endorsed attitudes that reflected relatively more positive influence (e.g., rating \u201csmoking a cigarette\u201d as more \u201cbad\u201d than the participant) vs. negative influence (e.g., rating \u201csmoking a cigarette\u201d as more \u201cgood\u201d than the participant). By measuring conformity across different types of behavior (i.e., constructive and unconstructive) and types of influence (i.e., positive and negative), we thus were able to capture how conformity unfolds across varying social contexts, particularly when adolescents were confronted with conflicting influences from their parents and peers. \n\nPrior research suggests that the extent to which adolescents conform to parent or peer influences depends on the social context ( ;  ). For instance, one study found that adolescents increase their prosocial behavior following prosocial peer feedback and decrease their prosocial behavior following antisocial peer feedback ( ). However, less is known about how adolescent conformity is affected when different types of behaviors or influences are pitted against each other. Thus, while we hypothesized that parent and peer conformity would differ between the types of behavior (i.e., constructive and unconstructive) and types of influence (i.e., positive and negative), we did not have predictions regarding the directionality of these behavioral effects. Given neural evidence in adolescents ( ;  ) and adults ( ) suggesting conformity may be a type of value-based decision, we hypothesized that greater conformity to a specific behavior or influence type would be supported by increased activity in neural regions associated with valuation (e.g., vmPFC, OFC, VS), mentalizing (dmPFC, TPJ, pSTS), and salience monitoring (e.g., dACC, insula, IFG). \n\nIn addition to our primary focus on context-dependent differences in conformity rates, we explored the relative influence of parents vs. peers, particularly when both endorsed attitudes that conflicted with adolescents\u2019 attitudes. The handful of studies that have compared parent and peer influence during adolescence have yielded inconsistent findings, with reports of no differences ( ;  ) or one source outweighing the other, for unconstructive behaviors ( ;  ) and constructive behaviors ( ) alike. To investigate how adolescents reconcile opposing attitudes from both their parents and peers, we leveraged our unique study design to explore whether there were differences in overall rates of conformity toward parents\u2019 or peers\u2019 conflicting attitudes at the behavioral and neural level. Since we examined conformity decisions across different social contexts (i.e., types of behavior and influence), we did not have a priori hypotheses about whether parents or peers would exert a stronger influence on adolescent attitudes overall. Similar to the neural hypotheses above, we expected that conformity to a specific person would be positively associated with neural activity in valuation-, mentalizing- and salience monitoring-related brain regions. \n\n\n## Material and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA total of 44 adolescents and their parents was recruited from a Midwestern community in the United States, but five participants were excluded: 2 had technical errors, 1 did not comply with task instructions, 1 had extreme ratings at the behavioral session that precluded creating balanced social influence manipulations for the fMRI task, and 1 had unusable fMRI data. The final sample included 39 adolescents (  M   = 13.48 years,   SD   = .63, range = 12.16\u201314.77 years; 20 females). The race/ethnicity of adolescent participants included White (  n   = 17), Black/African American (  n   = 8), Asian (  n   = 3), Other (  n   = 1), and multi-ethnic (  n   = 3 Black/White,   n   = 2 Hispanic/Other,   n   = 1 Hispanic/White,   n   = 1 Hispanic/Black,   n   = 1 Asian/White,   n   = 1 Asian/Other,   n   = 1 White/Other). Mothers reported their highest levels of education as high school (  n   = 2), some college (  n   = 8), college (  n   = 16), some medical, law, or graduate school (  n   = 1), and medical, law, or graduate school (  n   = 12). All participants were free of MRI contraindications (e.g., metal in body). Adolescents and their parents provided written assent and consent in accordance with the university\u2019s Institutional Review Board. \n\n\n### Behavioral session \n  \nDuring a behavioral session, adolescents and their parents reported their baseline attitudes toward everyday behaviors in which adolescents might engage ( A). Using a 10-point Likert scale (1=very bad, 10=very good), parents rated 100 behaviors, whereas adolescents rated 200 behaviors to ensure there were sufficient trials to manipulate for the fMRI task (described below). Half of the behaviors involved constructive behaviors (e.g., school habits, healthy behaviors, social interactions) and half involved unconstructive behaviors (e.g., deviancy, health risk behaviors, aggression). Constructive behaviors comprised actions that generally have more desirable consequences (e.g., working hard in school) and unconstructive behaviors comprised actions that generally have more undesirable consequences (e.g., smoking a cigarette; Table S1). Behaviors were presented in a random order and ratings were self-paced.   \nAttitude Conformity task. A) Two weeks prior to the scan, adolescents rated their attitudes toward everyday behaviors (in this schematic, the adolescent rating is circled for visualization purposes but was not shown during the task). B) During fMRI, adolescents were presented with opposing attitudes from their parent and peer, which were manipulated based on the adolescent\u2019s original rating during the behavioral session. On Parent Conflict trials, just the parent\u2019s rating conflicted from the adolescent\u2019s but the peer\u2019s rating matched. On Peer Conflict trials, just the peer\u2019s rating conflicted from the adolescent\u2019s but the parent\u2019s rating matched. On Mutual Conflict trials, both the parent\u2019s and peer\u2019s ratings conflicted from the adolescent\u2019s. Conformity was operationalized as choosing the person whose rating conflicted with the adolescent\u2019s original rating, whereas resistance was operationalized as choosing the person whose rating matched the adolescent\u2019s original rating. C) Social influence was manipulated in two ways: Parents and peers (1) influenced adolescents\u2019 attitudes toward unconstructive and constructive behaviors (i.e., type of behavior) and (2) endorsed attitudes that reflected either more positive or negative influence (i.e., type of influence). \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n### fMRI session \n  \nParticipants underwent fMRI approximately two weeks after the behavioral session. Before the scan, participants were introduced to an age- and gender-matched peer who they were told was also participating in the study and had rated the same behaviors. Participants were shown a profile page for the peer which displayed a picture (drawn from the NIMH Child Emotional Faces Picture Set; ( )), information about their hobbies, and a self-description handwritten by the peer. During a separate task, they also spoke to and heard the peer talk to them ( ). In reality, the peer was a confederate, and was not actually present at the scan. \n\n#### Attitude conformity fMRI task \n  \nParticipants completed the Attitude Conformity task during fMRI. On each trial, participants first viewed a behavior they previously rated (but were not reminded of their original ratings) (2 s). Following a jittered inter-stimulus interval (  M   = 2 s), participants were then shown their parents\u2019 and peers\u2019 ratings on each behavior and instructed to choose which person they agreed with most (maximum of 5 s). Participants pressed the left index finger when they agreed with their parent or right index finger when they agreed with their peer. Participants\u2019 choices were self-paced, such that the task advanced to the next behavior upon participant response. Behaviors were presented in random order and were separated by jittered inter-trial fixation periods (  M   = 2 s). Conformity was operationalized as choosing the person whose rating conflicted with the adolescent\u2019s original rating, whereas resistance was operationalized as choosing the person whose rating was the same as the adolescent\u2019s original rating (described below). \n\nIn order to examine decisions to conform in the face of conflicting attitudes, we tailored the task to each participant based on their ratings assessed during the behavioral session. Although we collected the parents\u2019 actual ratings during the behavioral session, and ostensibly collected peers\u2019 ratings, such ratings were not used as we carefully manipulated the ratings to fall within the attitude conflict and social influence conditions described below. Of the 200 behaviors that participants originally rated at the behavioral session, 120 behaviors were selected for the fMRI task based on two criteria. First, the participant\u2019s rating for a behavior needed to fall between minimum and maximum plausible ratings determined for each behavior based on pilot data, thereby maximizing ecological validity and checking for deviant responding (e.g., rating \u201ccheating on a test\u201d as 10=very good was outside the range of plausibility). Second, given that extreme ratings may be less likely to change ( ), the participant\u2019s rating for a behavior could not fall at the extremes of the scale (i.e., 1 or 10), ensuring that their parents\u2019 and peers\u2019 ratings could be manipulated to be below, above, or centered at participants\u2019 original ratings. Thus, the strength of participants\u2019 original ratings was relatively moderate across the subset of behaviors included in the fMRI task, with a balanced distribution across constructive and unconstructive behaviors. \n\n##### Source of attitude conflict \n  \nTo quantify the effect of conflicting influence, we manipulated parent and peer ratings in order to examine conformity when at least one of the influencer\u2019s ratings conflicted with the participant\u2019s original rating. There were three attitude conflict conditions that differed by the source of conflicting attitudes: Parent Conflict, Peer Conflict, and Mutual Conflict ( B). In the Parent Conflict condition, the peer\u2019s rating was the same as the participant\u2019s original rating and the parent\u2019s rating differed. In the Peer Conflict condition, the parent\u2019s rating was the same as the participant\u2019s original rating and the peer\u2019s rating differed. In the Mutual Conflict condition, both the peer\u2019s rating and parent\u2019s rating differed from the participant\u2019s original rating and from each other. Given participants were required to conform on Mutual Conflict trials (i.e., no option to resist), this third condition served as a control against Parent Conflict and Peer Conflict trials. In addition, the Mutual Conflict condition allowed us to explore if participants conform more to their peers\u2019 or parents\u2019 attitudes on average. Importantly, how the participant\u2019s choice on the task (i.e., parent or peer) mapped on to conformity depended on the attitude conflict condition. Conformity was defined as choosing the person whose rating conflicted with the participant\u2019s original rating, which could either be the parent (Parent Conflict), the peer (Peer Conflict), or both the parent and peer (Mutual Conflict) ( B, \u201cAdolescent decision to choose\u201d). Resistance was defined as choosing the person whose rating matched with the participant\u2019s original rating, which could either be the peer (Parent Conflict) or parent (Peer Conflict) ( B, \u201cAdolescent decision to choose\u201d). \n\n\n##### Type of behavior and influence \n  \nTo quantify the effect of social context, we manipulated social influence in two ways in order to examine conformity toward different (1) types of behavior (i.e., constructive and unconstructive) and (2) types of influence (i.e., positive and negative). First, we included an equal distribution of constructive behaviors (e.g., working hard in school) and unconstructive behaviors (e.g., smoking a cigarette) to examine whether participants conform differently based on whether their parents\u2019 and peers\u2019 attitudes were related to constructive or unconstructive behaviors ( C, \u201cConstructive/Unconstructive Behaviors\u201d). Second, we examined the extent to which participants were influenced by their parents and peers when they endorsed attitudes that reflected relatively more positive or negative influence ( C, \u201cPositive/Negative Influence\u201d). Positive influence was operationalized as the parent or peer endorsing attitudes that were relatively more positive than the participant\u2019s original rating (e.g., rating a constructive behavior as more \u201cgood\u201d along the 10-point scale than the participant and rating an unconstructive behavior as more \u201cbad\u201d along the 10-point scale than the participant). In contrast, negative influence was operationalized as the parent or peer endorsing attitudes that were relatively more negative than the participant\u2019s original rating (e.g., rating a constructive behavior as more \u201cbad\u201d along the 10-point scale than the participant and rating an unconstructive behavior as more \u201cgood\u201d along the 10-point scale than the participant). Notably, positive and negative influence need not be on the opposite side of the scale, but instead were relative to the participant\u2019s original rating. Thus, positive influence could still be rating an unconstructive behavior as somewhat good (i.e., ratings above \u201c5\u201d or \u201c6\u201d) as long as it was less good than the participant\u2019s original rating (and vice versa for negative influence). To create positive and negative influence, parent and peer ratings were manipulated to be 1\u20135 points below or above the participant\u2019s original rating, which was balanced across constructive and unconstructive behaviors. Positive and negative influence were examined only in the Peer Conflict and Parent Conflict conditions, where influence was manipulated in one direction. Positive and negative influence could not be examined on Mutual Conflict trials, where influence was manipulated in both directions (centered at the participant's original rating). \n\nOverall, the task included 120 trials, which were divided equally by the attitude conflict condition (40 Parent Conflict trials, 40 Peer Conflict trials, 40 Mutual Conflict trials). Each attitude conflict condition was equally divided by type of behavior (20 constructive and 20 unconstructive behaviors). Parent and Peer Conflict trials each included 20 positive influence and 20 negative influence trials. Some participants (  n   = 9) had less balanced positive and negative influence trials due to their original ratings; this was mostly attributed to more extreme ratings of constructive behaviors at the behavioral session that made it difficult to generate additional positive influence (i.e., operationalized as even more positive ratings) for the fMRI session (  n   = 6). To compensate, we generated additional positive or negative influence trials within the same behavior type (e.g., we generated more negative influence trials on constructive behaviors for the   n   = 6 who had fewer positive influence trials on constructive behaviors). \n\n\n\n\n### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nTwo generalized linear mixed-effects models were fitted to trial-by-trial choices on the Attitude Conformity fMRI task. All statistical models were estimated using the GLIMMIX procedure in SAS 9.4. For interpretation, unstandardized model estimates (log-odds) were converted to odds-ratios and predicted probabilities. \n\n#### Type of behavior analysis \n  \nFirst, we tested how the probability of conforming or resisting changes as a function of the type of behavior. Given the person whose rating conflicted or matched the participant\u2019s rating varied across the three attitude conflict conditions ( B, \u201cAdolescent decision to choose\u201d), the dichotomous choice to endorse the peer\u2019s rating vs. parent\u2019s rating was used as the dependent variable in this model. Primary analyses focused on examining differences in aligning with the person whose attitude conflicted with (i.e., conformity) or matched (i.e., resistance) the participant\u2019s original attitude on the Peer Conflict and Parent Conflict conditions. In addition, we conducted exploratory analyses to test overall differences in aligning with peers vs. parents on the Mutual Conflict condition, where conformity was forced given both the parent\u2019s and peer\u2019s attitudes conflicted with the participant\u2019s original attitude. We estimated the following equation: \n\nThe dichotomous choice to endorse the peer\u2019s rating or parent\u2019s rating (1=peer, 0=parent) on a particular trial (  i)   for a particular adolescent (  j  ) was modeled as a function of the following independent variables: the attitude conflict condition, type of behavior, and their respective interaction terms. The attitude conflict condition was entered with two dummy variables (1=ParentConflict, Other = 0; 1=PeerConflict, Other = 0) with Mutual Conflict omitted as the reference group. The type of behavior was coded as one dummy variable (1=Unconstructive, 0=Constructive). A random intercept was included to account for between-person variation in baseline propensity of choosing peer over parent. We specified a Bernoulli response distribution for the binary outcome and a logit link function to relate the predicted outcome to the linear predictors, with probability values restricted to (0, 1). \n\n\n#### Type of influence analysis \n  \nIn a separate generalized linear mixed-effects model, we tested how the probability of conforming or resisting differs as a function of the type of influence. Given that adolescents were forced to conform on Mutual Conflict trials (i.e., there was no option to resist), this analysis was constrained to Parent Conflict and Peer Conflict trials (80 total per participant). To focus on conformity decisions, the participant\u2019s choice on the task (i.e., peer or parent) was recoded to \u201cconformity\u201d (i.e., chose peer on Peer Conflict trials and chose parent on Parent Conflict trials) and \u201cresistance\u201d (i.e., chose parent on Peer Conflict trials and chose peer on Parent Conflict trials). The dichotomous choice to conform toward vs. resist choosing the person with conflicting ratings was used as the dependent variable in this model. We estimated the following equation: \n\nThe dichotomous choice to conform to or resist the person with conflicting ratings (1=conform, 0=resist) on a particular trial (  i)   for a particular adolescent (  j  ) was modeled as a function of two independent variables: the difference between the parent\u2019s rating and the participant\u2019s original rating (ParentPositive) and the difference between the peer\u2019s rating and the participant\u2019s original rating (PeerPositive). The parent and peer difference scores on unconstructive behaviors were reverse coded, so that, for unconstructive and constructive behaviors alike, higher scores indicate higher positive influence and lower scores indicate higher negative influence. A random intercept was included to account for between-person variation in baseline propensity of choosing to conform over resist. We specified a Bernoulli response distribution for the binary outcome and a logit link function to relate the predicted outcome to the linear predictors, with probability values restricted to (0, 1). \n\n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nImaging data were collected using a 3 T Siemens Magnetom Trio MRI scanner. The scan consisted of T2*-weighted echoplanar images (EPI; slice thickness = 3 mm; 38 slices; TR = 2 s; TE = 25 ms; matrix = 92 \u00d7 92; FOV = 230 mm; voxel size = 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 3 mm ). Structural scans were also acquired, including a T1* magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE; 192 slices; TR = 1.9 s; TE = 2.32 ms; FOV = 230 mm; matrix = 256 \u00d7 256; sagittal acquisition plane; slice thickness = .9 mm) and a T2*-weighted, matched-bandwidth (MBW), high resolution anatomical scan (38 slices; TR = 4 s; TE = 64 ms; FOV = 230 mm; matrix = 192 \u00d7 192; slice thickness = 3 mm). To maximize brain coverage and reduce signal drop-out in orbital and temporal regions, MBW and EPI images were acquired at an oblique axial orientation. \n\nPreprocessing steps were completed utilizing the FMRIB Software Library (FSL v6.0). Preprocessing included: skull stripping of all structural and functional images using BET; slice-to-slice head motion correction using MCFLIRT; sequential co-registration of EPI images to the MBW, MPRAGE, and standard stereotactic space defined by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and the International Consortium for Brain Mapping using FLIRT; removing low frequency drift across the EPI time-series using high-pass temporal filtering with a 128 s cutoff; and spatial smoothing using a 6 mm Gaussian kernel, full-width-at-half maximum. Independent component analysis (ICA) were performed on the individual level using MELODIC combined with an automated component classifier ( ) (Neyman-Pearson threshold = .3) in order to remove artifact signal (e.g. motion, physiological noise) from the functional data. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nThe Attitude Conformity fMRI task was modeled as an event-related design using the Statistical Parametric Mapping software package (SPM8; Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, Institute of Neurology, London, UK). In parallel with the behavioral analyses, we specified two separate individual level, fixed-effects models. Across both models, covariates of non-interest included: six motion parameters; volumes containing excessive motion (i.e., greater than 2 mm slice-to-slice movement along any axis); and the periods where the behavior was presented without the ratings (duration = 2 s). All adolescents had less than 2 mm slice-to-slice head motion on >95 % of total volumes. The jittered inter-stimulus and inter-trial periods were not modeled and therefore served as an implicit baseline for the task conditions of interest. \n\n#### Type of behavior analysis \n  \nFirst, we examined the effects of unconstructive and constructive behaviors at the whole-brain level. Six conditions of interest were defined based on the three attitude conflict conditions (Parent Conflict, Peer Conflict, Mutual Conflict), each modeled separately for unconstructive and constructive behaviors. Participants\u2019 dichotomous choice of peer or parent on a given trial (1=peer, 0=parent) was included as a parametric modulator for the six conditions to identify brain regions that differentially respond to endorsing peer vs. parent attitudes. Given the person whose attitude conflicted with the participant\u2019s attitude could either be the peer (Peer Conflict) or the parent (Parent Conflict), this PM was used to examine neural differences in aligning with the person whose attitude conflicted with (i.e., conformity) or matched (i.e., resistance) the participant\u2019s original attitude on the Peer Conflict and Parent Conflict condition. In addition to our primary analyses, we performed exploratory analyses to test for neural differences in aligning with peer attitudes (i.e., peer conformity) or parent attitudes (i.e., parent conformity) on the Mutual Conflict condition, where conformity was forced as both parents and peers endorsed attitudes that conflicted with the participant\u2019s original attitudes. Events were modeled using the onset of each event, with a duration equal to participants\u2019 response time to make a decision on that trial. \n\n\n#### Type of influence analysis \n  \nNext, we examined the effects of positive and negative influence at the whole-brain level. Four conditions of interest were defined based on the type of influence (negative influence, positive influence), modeled separately for parents (i.e., Parent Conflict trials) and peers (i.e., Peer Conflict trials). Mutual Conflict trials\u2014in which adolescents were forced to conform (i.e., there was no choice to resist)\u2014were modeled as a separate condition of non-interest. The absolute value of the difference between the influencer\u2019s rating and adolescent\u2019s original rating (range: 1\u20135) was included as a parametric modulator for the four conditions to identify brain regions that track increases in the level of positive and negative influence. Events were modeled using the onset of each trial, with a duration equal to participants\u2019 response time to make a decision on that trial. Our events of interest in this model did not separately model the choice (i.e., conform or resist), but instead focused on the entire decision phase of each trial. Finally, to test how neural tracking of the level of negative vs. positive influence is associated with overall rates of conformity, we conducted a whole-brain, regression analysis at the group level using the average frequency of conformity on negative vs. positive influence trials as a regressor. \n\nAll individual subject contrasts of interest were submitted to random-effects, group-level analyses at the whole-brain level in GLMFlex ( _Flex), corrected for multiple comparisons. Specifically, we ran a Monte Carlo simulation using the updated version (April 2016) of the 3dFWHMx and 3dClustSim programs from the AFNI software package ( ) for each group-level contrast of interest. The simulation resulted in a minimum cluster size threshold ranging from 82\u2013142 voxels across all contrasts of interest in the Type of Behavior Analysis and 86\u2013129 voxels across all contrasts of interest in the Type of Influence Analysis at the whole brain level, both corresponding to   p   < .05, Family-Wise Error (FWE) corrected given a voxel-wise threshold of   p   < .005. All results are available on NeuroVault ( ) (see  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Type of behavior \n  \n#### Behavioral results \n  \nTo examine the effect of type of behavior, we tested the probability of conforming to conflicting attitudes toward unconstructive and constructive behaviors on Parent Conflict and Peer Conflict trials vs. Mutual Conflict trials. Descriptively, participants had above-chance rates (i.e., confidence interval (CI) does not include 50 %) of resisting than conforming to conflicting attitudes ( A). Participants only had a 34.8 % mean probability of conforming (i.e., choosing parent) on Parent Conflict trials (95 % CI [30.5 %, 39.3 %]) and a 38.8 % mean probability of conforming (i.e., choosing peer) on Peer Conflict trials (95 % CI [34.3 %, 43.5 %]). These results suggest that adolescents are overall more likely to resist than conform when either parents or peers endorsed attitudes that conflicted with adolescents\u2019 personal attitudes.   \nBehavioral effects of type of behavior. A) Adolescents were less likely to conform to their parents\u2019 attitudes (i.e., chose parent) on Parent Conflict trials compared to Mutual Conflict trials, regardless of the type of behavior. B) Conformity to peers\u2019 attitudes (i.e., chose peer) on Peer Conflict trials depended on the type of behavior, such that adolescents were more likely to conform to their peers\u2019 attitudes toward constructive than unconstructive behaviors. \n\n Note:   Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. Decisions (i.e., probability of choosing peer or parent) that occurred significantly above or below chance level (i.e., 50 % probability) are denoted by significance stars above the condition, and decisions that varied across conditions are denoted with a significance bar. ***  p   < .001, **  p   < .01. \n  Fig. 2   \n\nWhen they did conform, participants conformed selectively based on the source of attitude conflict and type of behavior ( ). As shown in  A, participants were significantly less likely to conform to their parent on Parent Conflict trials (34.8 % mean probability; 95 % CI [30.5 %, 39.3 %]) compared to Mutual Conflict trials (52.9 % mean probability; 95 % CI [48.2 %, 57.6 %]). In other words, participants were less likely to conform to their parents when they shared similar attitudes with their peers (Parent Conflict), but had no preference for either person (i.e., conformed at chance) when they disagreed with both parents and peers (Mutual Conflict). There was no interaction with the type of behavior, suggesting that participants were equally likely to conform to their parents\u2019 attitudes toward unconstructive and constructive behaviors.   \nGeneralized linear mixed-effects analysis on type of behavior. \n  Table 1     \n\nIn contrast, conformity to peer attitudes depended on the type of behavior. As shown in  B, on Peer Conflict trials, participants were significantly less likely to conform to their peers\u2019 attitudes toward unconstructive behaviors (31.8 % mean probability; 95 % CI [27.7 %, 36.2 %]) than constructive behaviors (38.8 % mean probability; 95 % CI [34.3 % 43.5 %]). Thus, despite generally resisting conformity (i.e., choosing their parent) when their peers\u2019 attitudes conflicted with their own, participants were more likely conform to their peers\u2019 attitudes toward constructive over unconstructive behaviors when they did conform. \n\n\n#### fMRI results \n  \nGiven differences at the behavioral level (i.e., conforming more to constructive than unconstructive behaviors) for Peer Conflict trials, but no differences by the type of behavior for Parent Conflict trials, analyses examining neural differences during conformity decisions toward unconstructive vs. constructive behaviors focused on Peer Conflict trials (Unconstructive Peer Conflict > Constructive Peer Conflict). Participants showed greater activation in the vmPFC, dACC, insula, IFG, caudate, and hippocampus when conforming to their peers\u2019 attitudes toward unconstructive relative to constructive behaviors ( ;  A). For descriptive purposes, we extracted parameter estimates of neural activity from two of these regions, the vmPFC and dACC, separately for Unconstructive Peer Conflict and Constructive Peer Conflict trials. As shown in  B-C, participants exhibited increases in vmPFC and dACC activity when conforming to their peers\u2019 attitudes toward unconstructive behaviors, whereas they showed decreases in vmPFC and dACC activity when conforming to their peers\u2019 attitudes toward constructive behaviors (similar patterns were found in the other significant regions). No brain regions were more activated when conforming to peers\u2019 attitudes toward constructive vs. unconstructive behaviors. See Table S2 for a complete list of significant regions to all conditions by the source of attitude conflict and type of behavior.   \nWhole-brain condition effects by type of behavior. \n  Table 2       \nNeural responses during peer conformity to unconstructive relative to constructive behaviors. A) Whole-brain results for the Unconstructive Peer Conflict > Constructive Peer Conflict contrast. Adolescents exhibited parametric increases in the B) ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and C) dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and several other regions, during peer conformity toward unconstructive behaviors, whereas they showed decreases in these regions during peer conformity toward constructive behaviors. \n  Fig. 3   \n\n\n\n### Type of influence \n  \n#### Behavioral results \n  \nWe next compared whether conformity changes as a function of the extent to which parents and peers endorsed negative and positive influence. Participants were more likely to conform when they encountered more positive than negative influence, an effect that was similar across parents and peers ( ;  A-B). These results suggest participants selectively conform in contexts where their parents and peers endorsed more positive than negative influence.   \nGeneralized linear mixed-effects analysis on type of influence. \n  Table 3       \nBehavioral effects of type of influence. The mean probability of conformity is shown at -1 SD (i.e., negative influence) and +1 SD (i.e., positive influence) from the mean level of influence. Adolescents were more likely to conform when their A) parents and B) peers endorsed more positive influence than negative influence relative to what participants originally reported. \n\n Note:   Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. Decisions (i.e., conform or resist) that occurred significantly above or below chance level are denoted by significance stars above the condition, and decisions that varied across conditions are denoted with a significance bar. ***  p   < .001. \n  Fig. 4   \n\n\n#### fMRI results \n  \nGiven no differences between parent and peer influence at the behavioral level, we collapsed across Parent Conflict and Peer Conflict trials in order to compare neural regions that track the level of negative vs. positive influence when participants considered whether to conform (Negative Influence > Positive Influence). Results revealed that participants exhibited greater activation in the TPJ when they considered conforming to relatively more negative influence than positive influence (see   for complete list of regions). For descriptive purposes, parameter estimates of TPJ activity were extracted separately for Negative Influence and Positive Influence trials. As shown in  , participants exhibited parametric increases in TPJ activation when they considered conforming to relatively more negative influence, with no changes in TPJ activation when they considered conforming to relatively more positive influence.   \nWhole-brain condition effects by type of influence. \n  Table 4       \nNeural responses during conformity to negative vs. positive influence. A) Whole-brain analyses revealed there were parametric increases in TPJ activation when adolescents considered conforming to relatively more negative influence and no parametric changes in TPJ activation when they considered conforming to relatively more positive influence. B) A whole-brain regression analysis with the average frequency of conformity revealed adolescents who exhibited greater posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) activation when considering relatively more negative vs. positive influence had lower rates of conformity toward negative vs. positive influence. \n  Fig. 5   \n\nTo test whether the neural tracking of negative vs. positive influence predicted individual differences in average rates of conformity, we calculated a difference score between participants\u2019 average frequency of conformity to negative and positive influence, such that higher scores reflect greater conformity to negative influence. Difference scores were entered as a regressor in a whole-brain regression analysis on the Negative Influence > Positive Influence contrast. Results show that when deciding whether to conform to increasingly negative over positive influence, activation in the right pSTS (  xyz   = 64, -36, -8,   t   = 3.35,   k   = 214) was associated with a lower frequency of conforming to negative over positive influence. For descriptive purposes, parameter estimates of pSTS activity were extracted and plotted against the frequency of conformity (see  B). No other brain regions were correlated with the frequency of conformity toward negative vs. positive influence. \n\n\n\n### Peer vs. parent influence \n  \n#### Behavioral results \n  \nIn addition to the primary analyses on the type of behavior and type of influence, we explored whether there were differences in conforming to parents vs. peers on Mutual Conflict trials. Exploratory analyses testing whether adolescents conformed more than chance level (i.e., CI does not include 50 %) to peers compared to parents revealed that adolescents had a 47.1 % probability of selecting their peer over parent on Mutual Conflict trials (95 % CI [42.4 %, 51.8 %];  A). These results suggest that, within adolescents, peers do not have a larger effect than parents when both parents and peers endorsed attitudes that conflicted with the adolescents\u2019 original attitudes. \n\n\n#### fMRI results \n  \nAt the neural level, we explored overall differences between the neural correlates of conformity to peer vs. parent attitudes on Mutual Conflict trials (Peer Conformity > Parent Conformity). Exploratory analyses at the whole-brain level suggest adolescents showed greater activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) (  xyz  =-32 50 24;   t   = 3.53;   k   = 183), OFC (  xyz  =-26 28\u221216;   t   = 4.39;   k   = 191), pSTS extending into posterior insula (  xyz  =-50\u221234 8;   t   = 3.57;   k   = 313), putamen (  xyz  =-32\u221214 0;   t   = 6.30;   k   = 622), and cuneus (  xyz   = 16\u201392 28;   t   = 3.51;   k   = 983) when they conformed to their peer over parent. No brain regions showed greater activation during conformity to parent over peer influence. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe goal of the current study was to examine whether adolescents change their opinions when confronted with conflicting attitudes from their parents and peers, and characterize the neural mechanisms underlying conformity decisions across social influence contexts. In general, adolescents were more likely to resist than conform when confronted with opposing attitudes from others. When they did conform, adolescents were more likely to conform to their peers\u2019 attitudes toward constructive than unconstructive behaviors as well as when their peers and parents endorsed relatively more positive than negative influence. Exploratory analyses suggest peer influence did not outweigh parent influence overall. Neural responses in brain regions associated with valuation (e.g., vmPFC, subregions of the striatum), mentalizing (e.g., TPJ, pSTS), and salience monitoring (e.g., dACC, insula, IFG) may underlie context-dependent differences in parent and peer conformity. Collectively, these findings suggest that early adolescents may balance self- and social-related considerations differently across social contexts, which in turn guide decisions to conform to the conflicting attitudes of their parents and peers. \n\nOverall, adolescents were less likely to conform when their parent or peer endorsed attitudes that conflicted with their personal attitudes, sticking with their pre-existing attitudes 65 % of the time. These results suggest adolescents hold relatively consistent attitudes toward a behavior even when they conflict with others\u2019 attitudes. During early adolescence, youth become less willing to engage in behaviors that are inconsistent with their identity ( ) and start to show improvements in their ability to resist peer influence ( ). Consistent with prior work, our findings highlight the importance of adolescents\u2019 personal attitudes in buffering against conformity, such that youth are able to stand firm in their own attitudes even when confronted with opposing attitudes from parents or peers. \n\n### Attitude conformity toward unconstructive and constructive behaviors \n  \nWhen they did conform, adolescents were generally selective in who they conformed to depending on the social influence context. Whereas adolescents conformed to their parents\u2019 attitudes toward constructive and unconstructive behaviors at similar rates, they conformed to their peers\u2019 attitudes toward constructive behaviors more than unconstructive behaviors. Behavioral findings suggest that, when confronted with conflicting attitudes, adolescents may similarly incorporate their parents\u2019 conflicting attitudes toward constructive and unconstructive behaviors, but differentially evaluate and adopt their peers\u2019 conflicting attitudes based on the type of behavior. \n\nAccording to a theoretical review that recasts conformity as a value-based decision ( ), valuation processes in the brain, with input from brain regions associated with salience monitoring and mentalizing, play a central role in encoding and responding to social influence. Consistent with this perspective, our neural results indicate that the vmPFC and striatum, brain regions associated with valuation ( ), and the dACC, insula, and IFG, brain regions implicated in salience monitoring ( ), show different activation patterns during conformity to conflicting peer opinions based on the type of behavior under consideration. Contrary to hypotheses, neural activity in these brain regions show decreases (rather than increases) during conformity to peers\u2019 attitudes toward constructive behaviors. These neural results were surprising given that rates of peer conformity were higher for attitudes toward constructive behaviors than unconstructive behaviors. Expected increases in brain regions implicated in value and salience monitoring were found only when adolescents conformed to peers\u2019 attitudes toward unconstructive behaviors. Although brain regions implicated in valuation and salience monitoring have been linked to conformity toward diverging group opinions, the direction of neural activity within these regions remains inconsistent between adult and adolescent samples ( ). In adults, it has been proposed that, similar to reinforcement learning in social contexts, a polarized response within brain regions associated with value and salience monitoring signals the need to update one\u2019s own preferences to align with group norms ( ). In adolescents, however, increased activity in the brain\u2019s value system, among other cortical regions, is associated with greater conformity, with salience-related brain regions surprisingly not reported ( ;  ). Our findings suggest that, when peers endorse diverging attitudes toward constructive behaviors, increased peer conformity in early adolescence may be supported by a downregulation of both value- and salience-related brain regions. Alternatively, increased activity in brain regions associated with valuation and salience monitoring may underlie the deterrence of peer conformity toward unconstructive behaviors, a finding reported in adults that is thought to indicate the increased salience of nonconformity to group norms ( ;  ). Collectively, these data replicate and extend prior research on adolescent conformity to conflicting peer opinions, suggesting that valuation processes in the brain are modulated by the type of behavior being influenced and highlighting the added role of salience-related signals in motivating peer conformity. \n\n\n### Attitude conformity toward negative and positive influences \n  \nAdolescents\u2019 decision to conform also depended on the extent to which their parents and peers endorsed relatively more positive or negative influence. When parents and peers endorsed relatively more positive attitudes than the adolescents\u2019 original attitudes (i.e., positive influence), adolescents were more likely to conform by adopting the opposing attitudes of others. However, when parents and peers endorsed relatively more negative attitudes than the adolescents\u2019 original attitudes (i.e., negative influence), adolescents were more likely to stick with their pre-existing attitudes and resist conformity. These findings build upon prior work showing adolescents conform to their peers in both positive and negative directions ( ,  ), and add to this literature by demonstrating that when confronted with both types of influence simultaneously, positive influence may outweigh negative influence in early adolescence, whether it be from parents or peers. \n\nAt the neural level, adolescents exhibited parametric increases in TPJ activation when considering higher levels of negative influence from parents and peers, but showed no changes in TPJ activation when considering higher levels of positive influence. Furthermore, adolescents who exhibited greater pSTS activation when considering relatively more negative vs. positive influence showed lower average conformity to negative over positive influence. Prior studies in adolescents have demonstrated that conflict with the group opinion is associated with increased activity in mentalizing-related regions, including the TPJ and pSTS, and higher rates of conformity ( ;  ), which the authors interpreted to reflect the added mentalizing resources needed to understand and incorporate others\u2019 opinions when they deviate from one\u2019s own opinions. Surprisingly, we find no changes in TPJ activity during conformity to positive influences despite higher rates of conformity to positive over negative influences. Similar to comparisons between different types of behavior, expected increases in neural activity in mentalizing-related brain regions were found only when adolescents conformed to negative influences. These data provide converging evidence that mentalizing brain systems play a significant role in shaping adolescent conformity. Greater mentalizing resources may be needed particularly when parents and peers endorse more negative than positive influences on adolescent attitudes, perhaps because such attitude discrepancies are more uncommon, ultimately rendering adolescents less susceptible to conforming toward negative influence. \n\n\n### Attitude conformity toward peers and parents \n  \nExploratory analyses comparing parent to peer conformity revealed adolescents were equally likely to conform to their parents and peers when both endorsed attitudes that conflicted with the adolescents\u2019 attitudes (i.e., on Mutual Conflict trials). These results challenge prior research showing that one source of influence typically outweighs the other in adolescence ( ;  ;  ) and suggest that, even when they endorse opposing attitudes, parents and peers exert a similar influence on attitudes toward everyday behaviors in early adolescence. Indiscriminate patterns of conformity toward peers and parents may have stemmed from the increased difficulty of resolving conflict between their own attitudes and those of multiple sources of influence. At the neural level, adolescents showed increased recruitment of several striatal and cortical brain regions, including the putamen, OFC, pSTS, and dlPFC, when conforming to their peers\u2019 over parents\u2019 attitudes when both endorsed attitudes that conflicted with adolescents\u2019 pre-existing attitudes. Value-based decision making models underscore that value signals in the striatum and ventral prefrontal cortex (including its orbital subregion) regulate a wide range of motivated behaviors, with self- and social-relevant considerations as key inputs to how the value of competing choices are evaluated ( ;  ). In contrast to the more social cognitive functions of the pSTS, the dlPFC is commonly implicated in self-control and goal-directed behavior, primarily for its role in regulating value signals assigned to competing choices ( ;  ). Despite similar rates of attitude conformity to parents and peers, neural results suggest that brain regions associated with value, mentalizing, and self-control differentially support conformity to peers relative to parents in early adolescence. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nA major strength of this study is its ability to assess the range of susceptibility to conflicting influence across social contexts within adolescents. However, a few limitations should be noted. First, the generalizability of the current results to broader populations may be limited due to a relatively small sample size and recruitment of typically developing youth from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. In addition, the effects of peer and parent influence may be confounded by potential differences in the closeness of relationship (e.g., known parent vs. unknown peer) or the motivational relevance of the social actors employed in the current study (e.g., individual peer vs. peer group). Exploratory analysis comparing peers and parents revealed no behavioral differences in conformity, suggesting that the source of influence (parent/peer) may not be confounded with the known/unknown nature of these social relationships. Further, social influence manipulations were contingent on participants\u2019 original ratings, which unfortunately resulted in less balanced designs for some participants. Although linear mixed-effects models allow for unbalanced designs ( ), future research should better optimize experimental conditions in order to appropriately disentangle the role of relational vs. contextual factors in motivating attitude change, and explore its durability or subsequent effects on modifying behavior in adolescence. \n\nSecond, because the binary-choice task forced participants to agree with either their parent or peer, it is unclear whether the decision to choose the person whose attitude matched their original attitude is the same psychological process as resisting conflicting influence. Nevertheless, results indicate that adolescents did not always align themselves with the person whose attitudes matched their own, or make decisions arbitrarily (i.e., chance levels) or based on social preferences (i.e., greater conformity to the same person across conditions). Rather, participants\u2019 decision to align themselves with the person whose attitudes differed from their own depended on the type of behavior and influence, highlighting the importance of the social context in which conformity decisions unfold during early adolescence. \n\nFinally, longitudinal research is needed to explore if and how these conformity patterns change across adolescence. Prior work suggests that developmental trajectories of parent or peer conformity vary significantly as a function of the type of behavior ( ), albeit this research has neither examined the simultaneous influence of parents vs. peers nor considered the role of adolescents\u2019 personal attitudes. Although future empirical work is warranted, one hypothesis is that known peaks in risk-taking behaviors during late adolescence (age 18\u201321) confer developmental shifts toward greater influence of peers over parents or greater susceptibility to the effects of negative over positive influence. \n\nIn conclusion, our study challenges many prevailing conceptions of adolescence as a time of excessive conformity to negative influence. We demonstrate that adolescence may be a time when youth are able to stand firm in their own attitudes rather than blindly conforming to the opposing attitudes of others; a time when peers exert a stronger influence on adolescents\u2019 attitudes toward constructive than unconstructive behaviors; and a time when positive influence is stronger than negative influence from both parents and peers. \n\n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nE.

Interpersonal synchronization is crucial for achieving positive interactions, promoting affinity, closeness, and satisfaction. However, little is known about lonely individuals\u2019 ability to synchronize and about their brain activity while synchronizing. Following the screening of 303 participants, we recruited 32 low and 32 high loneliness participants. They were scanned while engaged in movement synchronization, using a novel dyadic interaction paradigm. Results showed that high loneliness individuals exhibited a reduced ability to adapt their movement to their partner\u2019s movement. Intriguingly, during movement adaptation periods, high loneliness individuals showed increased activation in the action observation (AO) system, specifically in the inferior frontal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule. They did not show increased activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, which in the context of synchronization was suggested to be related to gap-monitoring. Based on these findings, we propose a model according to which lonely people may require stronger activation of their AO system for alignment, to compensate for some deficiency in their synchronization ability. Despite this hyperactivation, they still suffer from reduced synchronization capacity. Consequently, synchronization may be a relevant intervention area for the amelioration of loneliness. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nLoneliness is a subjective experience of social isolation ( ), perceiving one\u2019s relations as lacking ( ). Loneliness is highly prevalent ( ;  ;  ;  ) and has gained public and academic attention as it was shown to harm mental and physical health ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nLonely people demonstrate deficits that make engaging in meaningful relationships harder. They experience more negative feelings during interactions ( ) and report lower relationship satisfaction, more conflict, and less self-disclosure and closeness ( ). Lonely people also maintain larger interpersonal distance ( ), even from friends ( ). A potential component of the failure to fully engage in interactions may be related to difficulties in synchronization. Interpersonal motor synchrony is defined as the alignment in time of the movements of interacting individuals ( ). Synchronization widely occurs naturally, and people coordinate their movement despite not being instructed to ( ,  ). It has been suggested that synchronization evolved to provide important adaptive values ( ;  ), including achieving emotional alignment ( ) and developing social bonds ( ;  ,  ;  ). Indeed, it was found to promote increased liking and affiliation ( ;  ), rapport ( ), trust ( ), empathy ( ), connection ( ), compassion ( ), excitement ( ), and prosocial behavior, even among infants ( ; for a recent review, see  ). It was suggested that perceived social bonding is associated with better synchronization capabilities ( ) and lonely people showed impaired spontaneous smile mimicry ( ). However, despite its significance to achieving significant social interaction, little is known about the ability of lonely people to synchronize with interacting partners. \n\nSynchronization involves several neural networks, most famous of which is the mirror neuron system (MNS), which includes neurons in the action observation (AO) network, activated both by execution of goal-directed actions and by observation of such actions by another ( ;  ). Two main areas in the AO system are the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) ( ;  ;  ), and both have been found to be involved in synchronization ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Notably, a recent brain model suggested that the AO system is one of three core components of social alignment, which mediate all types of synchrony, from movement to emotional and cognitive alignment ( ). In addition to the AO system, this model suggested the existence of a gap-monitoring system, which detects the gap between self and others, comprising the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and the anterior insula (AI). The model also suggested the existence of a reward system, which signals if the gap is optimal, comprising the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), and ventral striatum (VS) ( ). \n\nIntriguingly, some overlap exists between the alignment networks and the brain areas involved in loneliness. Among high loneliness individuals, there is a decrease in white matter density in the IFG ( ) and the bilateral IPL ( ). Lesions to the right IFG were associated with decreased loneliness scores, suggesting that the activity of this area in intact brains is related to increased loneliness ( ). Moreover, there is also evidence for the involvement of brain regions that are part of the proposed gap-monitoring and reward systems in loneliness. White matter density is lower among high loneliness individuals in the AI and the dmPFC ( ;  ), and high loneliness was associated with lesions to the right AI ( ). Lonely individuals showed reduced self\u2013other representational similarity in the medial PFC ( ). They also exhibited blunted functional connectivity between the AI and occipitoparietal regions during trust decisions ( ). Low loneliness individuals had altered functionality of the VS when viewing pleasant social pictures ( ) and pictures of close others ( ). (See   for a recent review of structural and functional studies of loneliness.) \n\nBased on these findings, the current study examined whether high loneliness individuals show impaired interpersonal synchronization during social interactions. The study used an interactive computerized paradigm, which enables neuroimaging acquisition from participants, as they engage in a joint activity that becomes increasingly synchronized ( ). During the study, individuals were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while interacting nonverbally by controlling the movement of differently colored circles. The task included three conditions. A random control condition (random), in which the scanned participant controlled the movement of one circle and a computer controlled the second circle; a free movement condition (free) in which both participants saw the circles moved by themselves and by the other participant and were instructed to move freely; and a synchronized movement condition (sync) in which they were asked to coordinate their movement with the other participant. The random condition was designed to make it impossible to synchronize, as the movement of the computer-controlled circle was fully randomized and therefore completely unpredictable. In the free condition, spontaneous synchronization could occur. The sync condition was expected to yield the highest level of synchronization. In this study, we used two measures of synchrony. We assessed the   zero-lag correlation score  , which is a dyad measurement of the synchronization achieved, previously used with this paradigm ( ). In addition, we focused on a measure of   following periods  . This is a newly developed individual measurement of the relative contribution of each of the dyad members to the achieved synchronization. While the zero-lag correlation score is a valuable measurement for the level of synchronization a dyad achieves, it does not allow a differentiation of the relative contribution of each of the participants to this synchronization. Both members of the dyad will obtain the same zero-lag correlation score, even though one may have contributed far more to the synchronization, by adjusting his or her movement more. In contrast, durations of following periods are calculated separately for each participant and provide a better measure of the effort each participant was putting into synchronizing with his/her partner. Obtaining such an individual measure is important since we aimed to examine individual brain activation. For this reason, we created the following periods measurement. Based on the various social impairments experienced by lonely people, it was hypothesized that, as compared to low loneliness participants, high loneliness participants would show diminished ability to synchronize as reflected by a lower zero-lag correlation score. Importantly, we hypothesized they would show diminished following periods, indicating that they contribute less to the achieved synchronization. This was hypothesized to occur in both the free and the sync conditions. \n\nWe also measured the level of enjoyment experienced by the participants throughout the task. We hypothesized that the enjoyment level would be highest in the sync condition, followed by the free condition and lastly by the random condition. Based on previous findings that lonely individuals enjoy social interactions less ( ;  ), we hypothesized that high loneliness individuals would report lower enjoyment scores in the free and sync conditions when compared to low loneliness individuals. \n\nFrom a neural perspective, the study first aimed to seek support for the interpersonal synchronization neural model. As such, it was hypothesized that during synchronized movement we would see the involvement of the AO system, focusing primarily on the IFG and IPL, as well as the gap-monitoring system (dmPFC, dACC, and AI) and the reward system (VS, vmPFC, and OFC). These regions were expected to be involved in both spontaneous (free movement) and intentional synchronization. Second, as there is some evidence that these areas may be structurally or functionally different among lonely individuals, we hypothesized that differences between high loneliness and low loneliness individuals would also be found in these regions of interest during synchronization. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nAbout 303 participants were recruited using social media advertisements. Respondents were screened for the following criteria: (i) fluency in Hebrew; (ii) right-hand dominance; (iii) no medication use (except for oral contraceptives); (iv) no history of neurological disorders or psychiatric problems; (v) no conditions that prevented scanning (e.g. a pacemaker, claustrophobia); and (vi) normal or corrected-to-normal vision, including no color blindness. In addition, all participants filled the UCLA loneliness questionnaire ( ); see details below. The mean UCLA score in the large sample was 40.809 (SD\u2009=\u200910.071), median score\u2009=\u200939, and mode\u2009=\u200936. This median score was in accordance with previous findings on similar populations ( ). To determine the desired sample size, we used G*Power ( ). Based on a previously reported effect of loneliness on the neural processing of social stimuli, 0.46 ( ), with \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 and power\u2009=\u20090.95, the minimal sample size for a between-subject design was 52 participants. We decided to use a larger sample, in order to allow for potential dropouts or participants that would have to be excluded due to head movements, abnormal neurological findings, or technical issues. We screened 303 participants and 68 healthy participants met the selection criteria. Since the study aimed to compare low and high loneliness individuals, half of the group that was recruited had a loneliness score that was higher than the mean score in the larger sample (\u226541) and the other half had a loneliness score that was lower than the mean score in the larger sample (<41). Participants were assigned to same-gender dyads. Since the focus of the analysis was not on the dyad level, we did not specifically recruit dyads according to their loneliness level. Therefore, some dyads had two low loneliness participants (6 dyads), some dyads had two high loneliness participants (6 dyads), and the majority had one low and one high loneliness participant (22 dyads). During data analysis, one participant was excluded due to a neurological finding in the anatomical scan. Another participant was excluded since there was an unexplained scan artifact. Two participants were excluded due to excessive head movement during scanning (>2.5\u00a0mm/\u00b0). Out of the excluded participants, three were female (two reported high loneliness and one reported low loneliness) and one was male (reported low loneliness). Dyad partners of the excluded participants were not excluded from analysis, as exclusion reasons were related to the fMRI scanning and not to the excluded participants\u2019 behavior. Therefore, the analyzed sample included 64 participants (45 females, age 18\u201335, mean age\u2009=\u200925.41, SD\u2009=\u20094.20). The study was approved by the ethics committee of Tel Aviv University and the institutional review board at the Sheba Tel Hashomer medical center and was conducted in accordance with the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study. \n\n\n### Experimental procedure \n  \nEach dyad was invited to the center at the same time. It was confirmed that there was no prior acquaintance between them. After joint debriefing, one participant entered the scanner, and the other participant went into a room adjacent to the fMRI scanner control room. Both participants completed the synchronization task (see below), after which the participant in the scanner remained for an anatomical scan. Subsequently, participants switched places and repeated the task. Monetary compensation was provided for participation, in the amount of 150 NIS, the equivalent of about \u00a335 or $48. \n\n\n### Measures \n  \n#### Synchronization task \n  \nTo measure real-time synchronization among interacting participants, the study used a computer-based movement synchronization multiagent paradigm ( ). This game allows individuals to interact nonverbally by controlling the movement of circle-shaped figures with different colors. The displays are fully synchronized as the computers are connected via a closed network. During the game, each player faces a screen with a rectangle presented on it. The participants are instructed to imagine that the rectangle represents a room. At the beginning of the game, two circles appear on the screens, and each player is assigned one of them (blue, red). Participants are instructed to imagine that the circle represents them, as they are moving in the room. The participant in the scanner uses the response box, while the participant outside the scanner uses a keyboard to control the movement of the circles. \n\nThe task includes three conditions. (i) Random condition\u2014each participant controls the movement of the circle that was assigned to them. The other circle\u2019s movement is controlled by the computer and is randomized. The participants are aware that the other circle is controlled by a computer. (ii) Free condition\u2014each participant controls the movement of the circle that was assigned to them, and the other circle is controlled by the other participant. Participants are aware that the other circle is controlled by the other participant and are instructed to move their circle freely. (iii) Sync condition\u2014this condition is similar to the free condition; however, the participants are instructed to synchronize their movement to the best of their ability. The order of the conditions was maintained for all participants as was established in a previous study ( ) so that instructed synchrony will not affect the emergence of spontaneous synchrony right after it. \n\nPrior to entering the scanner, participants received an explanation about the task and were shown the response box they would be using. Each condition was scanned in a separate run and contained three blocks. At the beginning of each block, a fixation point appeared on the screen for 12\u00a0s, followed by the presentation of an instruction slide (5\u00a0s), after which the participants performed the task for 45\u00a0s. After this, participants were given 10\u00a0s to rate how much they enjoyed the game.   presents an illustration of the task design. \n  \nIllustration of the task design. \n  \nThe movement of the circle assigned to the participant outside the scanner was controlled using the 1\u20134 keys on a keyboard, and the movement of the circle assigned to the participant inside the scanner was controlled using the 4 keys of the response box. Each key represented a direction (left, up, right, down) and combinations of two keys were allowed (e.g. left\u2009+\u2009up\u2009=\u2009diagonal left). Communication between each client and the server was executed asynchronously at about 5\u00a0Hz, and postprocessing interpolation of all data was conducted at a rate of 5\u00a0Hz, such that data for all participants shared matching sample times. The movement of each circle was determined by the vector sum of movements in the four major directions. These sums were calculated based on durations of key presses during the intervals between consecutive samples (~200\u00a0ms). \u201cDown\u201d durations were subtracted from \u201cup\u201d durations, and \u201cleft\u201d durations were subtracted from \u201cright\u201d durations. The resulting differences were then multiplied by a constant factor to determine the extent of movement (in pixels) in each axis. \n\n\n#### Synchronization measurements \n  \n##### Following periods \n  \nAs mentioned above, it was especially important to differentiate the individual contribution of the participants to the synchronization because this study aimed to examine individual brain activation. Therefore, we have created a new synchronization measurement termed \u201cfollowing periods.\u201d \n\nTo measure the relative contribution of each participant to the achieved synchronization, we examined periods during which a participant actively adapted his or her movement to that of his or her partner. As mentioned above, each participant\u2019s location was recorded at a sampling frequency of 5\u00a0Hz, yielding 5*45\u2009=\u2009225 samples per block. From this data, we calculated changes in locations between consecutive samples and used these differences to identify the direction in which each participant had moved during each interval between consecutive samples. There are eight possible movement directions (0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 270\u00b0, and 315\u00b0). The net change in location between two consecutive samples is a vector sum of the products of directions selected by the participant within that interval, multiplied by their durations. This sum does not necessarily coincide with one of the eight aforementioned directions. Therefore, actual directions were \u201crounded\u201d to the closest main direction. Periods during which the two dyad members were moving in the same direction were then identified. Within these periods, we projected participants\u2019 locations onto their (common) direction of movement. Relative to the direction of movement, the person who was \u201cbehind\u201d was considered to be the one that was following the person who was \u201cin front.\u201d For example, if the direction of movement was right, or 90\u00b0, the person whose location was more to the right was considered \u201cin front.\u201d A following period for participant 1 was defined as the period in which participant 1 was the one following participant 2. A total   following score   was calculated, summing up the following periods per participant and per condition. A higher score would indicate that a participant spent more time actively aligning their movement direction with the movement of the other participant. \n\n\n##### Zero-lag correlation \n  \nWe also analyzed participants\u2019 behavior using a previously created dyad measurement of synchronization, the   zero-lag correlation score   ( ). This measurement is based on a directional correlation ( ) between the movements of the two participants. Directional correlation is the cosine of the angle between the velocities of each pair of players. The directional correlation between participant   i   and participant   j   is given by  , where <  v  ,  v  > is the inner product of the velocities of the two participants, and |  v  | and |  v  | are the magnitudes of the velocities of participant   i   and participant   j  , respectively. Higher correlation indicates stronger synchronization. The zero-lag correlations were calculated using sliding windows of 21 samples (i.e. \u00b12\u00a0s around a given sample).   presents an example of the synchronization score calculated over time for one of the dyads. \n  \nExample of the zero-lag correlation scores calculated over time for one dyad. The blocks of random condition (left), free condition (middle), and sync condition (right) are presented. The   X   axis represents the time in seconds, and the   Y   axis is the zero-lag correlation score. \n  \n\n##### Zero-lag synchronization periods \n  \nSince we aimed to identify neural activity during periods in which synchronization took place, we identified   zero-lag synchronization periods  \u2014periods in time where the zero-lag correlation score was sufficiently high. These periods were defined by a combination of three parameters: (i)   zero-lag correlation score threshold;   (ii)   minimal synchronization duration  \u2014the minimal continuous period in seconds in which the zero-lag correlation score had to be above the threshold. This allowed for the identification of periods where synchronization was taking place, in contrast to points in time in which movement was coordinated by chance; (iii)   maximal synchronization intermission  \u2014the maximal period in seconds within the minimal synchronization duration, in which the zero-lag correlation score could drop below the threshold. This allowed us to consider periods as synchronization periods even if one of the participants, for example, paused to assess the movement of the other participant. A total   zero-lag synchronization periods score   was calculated, summing up the zero-lag synchronization periods per participant and per condition. \n\nTo identify the optimal parameter combination for zero-lag correlation score threshold, minimal synchronization duration, and maximal synchronization intermission, we first selected the zero-lag correlation threshold, which was determined based on the median zero-lag correlation score in the sync condition, 0.5. We then analyzed all the possible combinations of synchronization duration and maximal intermission that resulted in at least one synchronization period per participant in the free movement and the sync conditions. Finally, we identified which parameter combination results in the best discrimination between the random condition and the free movement/sync condition. In the free movement condition, the best discrimination from the random condition was found with the parameters\u2014synchronization duration\u2009=\u20095\u00a0s and maximal intermission\u2009=\u20093\u00a0s (marked by the red ellipses in  ). In the sync condition, the best discrimination from the random condition was found with the parameters\u2014synchronization duration\u2009=\u20098.2\u00a0s and maximal intermission\u2009=\u20092.6\u00a0s (marked by the blue ellipses in  ). However, using these parameters resulted in no zero-lag synchronization periods in the free movement condition. There was an additional local maximum for the discrimination using the parameters\u2014synchronization duration\u2009=\u20094.8\u00a0s and maximal intermission\u2009=\u20092.2\u00a0s (marked by the dotted blue ellipses in  )\u2014and we chose to use this value as it was also close to the values identified in the free movement condition. \n  \nZero-lag synchronization periods parameter selection. First, the zero-lag correlation score threshold was identified using the median zero-lag correlation score in the sync condition (0.5). Then the zero-lag synchronization periods score was identified for all possible combinations of the three parameters\u2014the zero-lag correlation score (0.5), synchronization durations, and maximal intermission. This was calculated for the sync, free, and random conditions. The goal was to identify a combination of values that best discriminates the sync or free conditions from the random condition. The charts display a \u201cheat map\u201d of the difference in zero-lag synchronization periods score between A) the sync and random condition and B) the free and random condition, for each combination of synchronization durations (in the   y   axis) and maximal intermission (in the   x   axis). Larger differences are yellow; smaller differences are blue. The best discrimination between the free and random condition (the largest difference in zero-lag synchronization periods) is marked in the red ellipse. The best discrimination between the sync and random condition (the largest difference in zero-lag synchronization periods) is marked in the blue ellipse. The selected value is based on a local maximum of discrimination in the sync\u2009>\u2009rand conditions and is marked by a dotted blue ellipse. \n  \n\n\n#### Enjoyment ratings \n  \nParticipants\u2019 enjoyment ratings in each of the blocks were used to calculate an average enjoyment score in each condition for each participant. \n\n\n#### Loneliness measurement \n  \nTo assess levels of loneliness, participants completed the UCLA loneliness scale version 3 ( ). The UCLA loneliness scale was initially developed in 1978 ( ) and has since been revised twice to improve its validity and reliability. In the current version, the respondent is asked to rate the frequency of loneliness-related experiences. Some items refer to negative experiences, for example \u201cHow often do you feel left out?\u201d and some items refer to positive experiences, for example \u201cHow often do you feel part of a group of friends?\u201d. Each item is rated on a scale of 1 (never) to 4 (often), and after reversing the questions that relate to positive experiences, a total loneliness score (20\u201380) is calculated. The mean score in the UCLA scale in the study was 41.938 (SD\u2009=\u200912.952) and the median score was 38. As explained in the participants section, participants filled out the UCLA scale during screening, and then two groups were recruited, based on their loneliness score. Comparing high and low loneliness groups was done in multiple past studies (e.g.  ,  ;  ). The mean loneliness scores in the low and high loneliness groups were 30.593 (SD\u2009=\u20094.550) and 53.281 (SD\u2009=\u20097.385), respectively. \n\n\n#### Additional measurements \n  \nDepression, autism-like tendencies, and empathy were measured to test whether findings were specific to loneliness. To assess levels of depression, participants were administered the Beck Depression Inventory version II (BDI-II) ( ). The mean score was 10.625 (SD\u2009=\u20098.316). The low loneliness group had a significantly lower depression score (mean\u2009=\u20097.188, SD\u2009=\u20096.098) when compared to the high loneliness group (mean\u2009=\u200914.063, SD\u2009=\u20098.886) [  t  \u2009=\u20093.609,   P  \u2009=\u20090.001, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.902]. Participants were split into high and low depression groups based on the median BDI score (median\u2009=\u20099). To assess levels of autism-like tendencies, participants were administered the Autism Quotient (AQ) scale ( ). The mean score was 18.172 (SD\u2009=\u20096.232). The low loneliness group had a significantly lower AQ score (mean\u2009=\u200916.125, SD\u2009=\u20095.514) when compared to the high loneliness group (mean\u2009=\u200920.219, SD\u2009=\u20096.612) [  t  \u2009=\u20092.762,   P  \u2009=\u20090.008, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.672]. Participants were split into high and low autism-related traits groups based on the median AQ score (median\u2009=\u200918). To assess levels of empathy, participants were administered the Interpersonal Reactivity Index ( ). The mean score was 67.438 (SD\u2009=\u200912.173). There was no significant difference in IRI between the low loneliness group (mean\u2009=\u200968.719, SD\u2009=\u200912.376) and the high loneliness group (mean\u2009=\u200966.156, SD\u2009=\u200912.024) [  t  \u2009=\u20090.840,   P  \u2009=\u20090.404]. Participants were split into high and low empathy groups based on the median IRI score (median\u2009=\u200968). \n\n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nBehavioral data were analyzed by calculating mixed-design analyses of variance (ANOVAs), with either following score (the sum of all following periods per participant per condition), zero-lag correlation score or enjoyment score as the dependent variable, condition (random, free, or sync) as the within-subject repeated measure, and loneliness group (high, low) as the between-subject factor. Additional analyses included   t  -tests and bivariate Pearson correlations.   P  -values\u2009<\u20090.05 (two-tailed) were considered significant. Effect sizes were estimated using partial eta squared (\u03b7   ) or Cohen\u2019s   d  . Cronbach\u2019s Alpha was calculated on the UCLA loneliness scale as a measure of its reliability. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0. As each participant performed the synchronization task twice, once outside the scanner and once inside the scanner, scanning order was used as a between-subject control variable to test if it impacted the results. \n\n\n#### MRI data acquisition \n  \nMRI was conducted using a 3T Siemens Magnetom Prisma Scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) at the Strauss Imaging Center on the campus of Tel Aviv University. Images were acquired using a 64-channel head coil. Every session included 3D-anatomical scanning and functional imaging. Anatomical scans were obtained using a T1-weighted 3D MP2RAGE (TR\u20142.53\u00a0s; TE\u20142.99\u00a0ms; flip angle\u20147\u00b0, 176 sagittal slices; spatial resolution\u20141\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u00a0mm ). During task performance, behavioral judgment was collected via a fiber optic response pad (Current Designs, Inc. PA, USA). Functional MRI was acquired by multiband echo planar imaging (mb-EPI) pulse sequence for simultaneous excitation for multiple slices with the following parameters: TR\u2009=\u20092\u00a0s, TE\u2009=\u200930\u00a0ms, band factor\u2009=\u20092, Ipat\u2009=\u20092, isotropic spatial resolution of 2\u00a0mm  (no gaps). \n\n\n#### MRI data preprocessing and analysis \n  \nFMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping toolbox for MATLAB (SPM12: Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, University College London). Preprocessing of functional scans included quality assurance, slice timing correction, realignment and unwarping, coregistration, normalization to a standard T1 template (MNI), and smoothing. Head movement was assessed and corrected. 3D statistical parametric maps were calculated separately for each subject using a general linear model (GLM). First-level contrasts of interest were calculated (see below), and then we used a one-sample   t  -test analysis on the second level. All GLM analyses were thresholded at a family-wise error (FWE) corrected whole-brain   P   value\u2009<\u20090.05 after an initial cluster-forming height threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.001. We contrasted each of the conditions in which participants had been interacting with each other (sync or free, separately) with the random condition. Obtained whole-brain analyses were masked with the activation map obtained for the sync/free condition minus its baseline (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05), to ensure that the resulting differences were due to activation in that condition rather than deactivation in the random condition. To determine whether scanning order had impacted the results, we also performed second-level analyses in which scanning order was included as a between-subject factor, and a two-sample   t  -test was conducted to compare the two scanning order groups. \n\nTwo types of whole-brain analyses were implemented at the individual level. First, to validate the proposed neural model for interpersonal synchronization and to explore the three conditions of the task, regardless of the actual behavior of the subjects in each task condition, we carried out an initial contrast between the task conditions. We contrasted   individual brain activity throughout the sync condition with the random condition (total run duration sync\u2009>\u2009random)   as the main contrast of interest on the first level and then used a one-sample   t  -test analysis on the second level. A similar analysis was done for the free condition   (total run duration free\u2009>\u2009random)  . The contrasts used the onsets and durations of the task condition, summing up the three movement trials of 45\u00a0s each. Second, to explore brain activation during following periods, we contrasted individual brain activity for following periods   in the sync condition\u2009>\u2009following periods in the random condition   as the main contrast of interest on the first level. This contrast used the following periods onsets and durations, as identified in the method described in Section Following Periods. However, in the random condition, there were hardly any periods of time that could be considered as \u201cfollowing.\u201d This was expected because by design in the random condition it was not possible to intentionally follow as the movement of the second circle was completely random. Nevertheless, to calculate the main contrast of interest, the onsets and durations of following periods had to be specified also for the random condition. We thus decided to use the same onsets and durations of following periods as identified in the sync condition. This way, we assured similar durations of time periods being analyzed in the sync and in the random condition. For example, if a following period was identified for a specific user between seconds 3 and 7 of the sync condition, the contrast defined second 3 as an onset and 4\u00a0s as the duration, in both the random and the sync conditions. A similar analysis was done for the free condition following periods   free condition\u2009>\u2009following periods random condition.   Similarly, we analyzed individual brain activity for zero-lag synchronization periods in the   sync\u2009>\u2009random   contrast as well as   in the free\u2009>\u2009random   contrast. \n\nWe also conducted an ROI analysis focused on the difference between high and low loneliness participants. Our hypothesis focused on the brain regions suggested to be involved in synchronization (dmPFC, dACC, AI, IFG, IPL, premotor cortex, OFC, vmPFC, VS). Out of those, we identified the ROIs in which activation was confirmed in the whole-brain analysis of following periods and of zero-lag synchronization periods as described above, as this analysis established their relevance to brain activity during following periods or zero-lag synchronization periods. Anatomical ROIs were then defined using the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas version 3 ( ). Beta values were extracted and then used to test differences between the high and low loneliness groups using independent samples t-tests. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was used for multiple comparisons.   P   values smaller than 0.05 after correction were considered significant. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral data \n  \nThe reliability of the UCLA Loneliness Scale was excellent (Cronbach\u2019s Alpha\u2009=\u20090.957). \n\nTo test potential differences between males and females, we ran independent sample   t  -tests with loneliness scores, following scores in the sync condition, enjoyment scores in the sync condition, or zero-lag correlation scores in the sync condition as the dependent variables, and sex as the between-subject factor. These analyses yielded no significant differences between sexes (  P  \u2009>\u20090.142). We thus ran the following analyses on both females and males together. \n\nA mixed-design ANOVA with following score as the dependent variable was employed. The analysis yielded significant main effects of condition [  F  \u2009=\u2009149.431,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, \u03b7   \u2009=\u20090.707] and of loneliness [  F  \u2009=\u20094.764,   P  \u2009=\u20090.033, \u03b7   \u2009=\u20090.071]. A significant interaction between condition and loneliness was also found [  F  \u2009= ;5.503,   P  \u2009=\u20090.018, \u03b7   \u2009=\u20090.082]. Following score was significantly higher in the sync condition compared with the random condition [  t  \u2009=\u200911.911,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20092.088] and compared with the free condition [  t  \u2009=\u200912.300,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20092.117]. The difference between the free and the random condition was not significant (  P  \u2009=\u20090.696). Follow-up analysis revealed that the high loneliness group showed a lower following score in the sync condition compared with the low loneliness group [  t  \u2009=\u20092.373,   P  \u2009=\u20090.021, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.593]; see  . Similarly, a significant negative correlation was found between loneliness and the following score in the sync condition (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.319,   P  \u2009=\u20090.01). \n  \nHigh loneliness group had a lower following score in the sync condition. Following score was higher in the sync condition, compared to free and random condition. Error bars\u2009=\u200995% confidence level (cl). \n  \nA mixed-design ANOVA with zero-lag correlation score as the dependent variable yielded a significant main effect of condition [  F  \u2009=\u2009343.110,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, \u03b7   \u2009=\u20090.847]. No other main effects or interactions were significant (  P  \u2009>\u20090.404). As expected, the zero-lag correlation was significantly higher in the sync condition (  M  \u2009=\u20090.522, SD\u2009=\u20090.165) compared with the free condition (  M  \u2009=\u20090.011, SD\u2009=\u20090.149) [  t  \u2009=\u200919.231,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20093.251] and compared with the random conditions (  M  \u2009=\u20090.008, SD\u2009=\u20090.078) [  t  \u2009=\u200924.110,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20093.983]. There was no significant difference between the free and random conditions (  P  \u2009=\u20090.902). When comparing high and low loneliness groups\u2019 zero-lag correlations scores, there was no significant difference in any of the conditions (  P  \u2009\u2265\u20090.344). \n\nFurthermore, we explored differences in enjoyment between the conditions. A mixed-design ANOVA with the enjoyment score as the dependent variable was employed. The analysis yielded a significant main effect of condition [  F  \u2009=\u20098.856,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, \u03b7   \u2009=\u20090.125]. No other main effects or interactions were significant (  P  \u2009>\u20090.162). Enjoyment level in the sync condition (  M  \u2009=\u200962.787, SD\u2009=\u200919.956) was higher when compared to the random condition (  M  \u2009=\u200954.037, SD\u2009=\u200924.359) [  t  \u2009=\u20093.657,   P  \u2009=\u20090.001, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.393]. The enjoyment level in the free condition (  M  \u2009=\u200960.208, SD\u2009=\u200922.219) was also higher when compared to the random condition [  t  \u2009=\u20092.803,   P  \u2009=\u20090.007, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.265]. The difference between the enjoyment levels in the free condition and the sync condition was not significant (  P  \u2009=\u20090.136). When comparing high and low loneliness groups\u2019 enjoyment scores, there was no significant difference in any of the conditions (  P  \u2009\u2265\u20090.173). \n\nTo confirm no difference existed between participants who were scanned first and those participants who were scanned second in parameters of age and loneliness, we ran   t  -tests with UCLA loneliness score and age as the dependent variables, and order as the between-subject factor. These analyses yielded no significant differences between the two groups (  P  \u2009>\u20090.544). When including order as an additional between-subject factor in the mixed-design ANOVAs reported above (with following score or zero-lag correlation score or enjoyment score as the dependent variable), the main effects and/or interactions reported were not impacted by order, and no interactions or main effects with order were found (  P  \u2009>\u20090.072). \n\nTo test whether the findings were specific to loneliness, we repeated the mixed-design ANOVAs reported above (with following scores or zero-lag correlation scores or enjoyment scores as the dependent variable), this time with depression, autism-like tendencies, or empathy as the between-subject factor instead of loneliness. The analyses did not yield significant main effects for depression, autism-like tendencies, or empathy, or did they yield significant interactions (  P  \u2009>\u20090.08). \n\n\n### Neuroimaging analysis \n  \nWhole-brain analysis comparing activity patterns between the total run duration of the sync condition and the random condition showed that during the sync condition there was increased activation in the right IPL (58, \u221246, 32), right IFG opercular part (50, 18, 34), left IPL (\u221256, \u221258, 28), and dmPFC (18, 60, 24). In addition, there was increased activation in left superior cerebellum (\u221222, \u221276, \u221234) and the middle and superior temporal gyrus/STS (46, \u221224, \u22126); see   and  . A similar whole-brain analysis was conducted, comparing activity patterns between the total run duration of the free condition and the random condition. During the free condition, there was increased activation in the right supramarginal gyrus and right IPL (52, \u201344, 24) and the lateral surface of the superior frontal gyrus extending to the mPFC (18, 56, 22). Additional activation was detected in the supplementary motor area (16, \u22122, 74); see   and  . We repeated the analyses, including scanning order as a between-subject factor, conducting a two-sample   t  -test analysis on the second level, and no significant differences in activation were found. These findings show that areas in the AO network and the gap-monitoring network were active throughout both the sync condition and the free condition. \n  \nBrain activation in the sync condition\u2009>\u2009random condition contrast, during the total run duration, across loneliness groups.

MNI coordinates of axial/coronal/sagittal view\u2014(5, \u221240, 40). \n  \nTo analyze the differences in brain activation during periods in which the scanned participant was actively aligning his or her movement with the other participant (as opposed to the entire run duration of each condition, regardless of the specific behavior of the participant in that time), a whole-brain analysis was conducted comparing activity patterns during following periods in the sync condition (see explanation in Section Following Periods) and parallel periods of time during the random condition. This yielded significant clusters in the right IPL (54, \u221242, 48), the left IPL (\u221256, \u221246, 38), the right IFG opercular part (42, 8, 50), and the dmPFC, extending also into the lateral surface of the superior frontal gyrus (14, 26, 62). In addition, there was increased activation in the superior cerebellum (\u221218, \u221278, \u221226) and the right middle occipital gyrus (38, \u221284, 22). See   and  . A similar analysis of the free condition compared to the random condition did not yield significant clusters. We repeated the analyses, including scanning order as a between-subject factor and conducting a two-sample   t  -test analysis on the second level, and no significant differences in activation were found.

This yielded significant clusters in the right IPL (56, \u221242, 48), left IPL (\u221256, \u221246, 40), right IFG, opercular part (38, 10, 24), and the right dmPFC (6, 36, 34); see  .

Similarly, in the right IPL, the high loneliness group had a higher activation (  M  \u2009=\u20090.528, SD\u2009=\u20090.567) compared to the low loneliness group (  M  \u2009=\u20090.216, SD\u2009=\u20090.432) (  t  \u2009=\u20092.478,   P  \u2009=\u20090.016,   P  (corr)\u2009=\u20090.040, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.619). The differences in the dmPFC, lIPL, and the rIFG were not significant (  P  \u2009>\u20090.151,   P  (corr)\u2009>\u20090.188).   T  -tests were FDR corrected for multiple comparisons;   P  (corr) represents the corrected   P   value. See   and   for detailed results.

Furthermore, we tested a proposed neural model for interpersonal synchronization and explored the neural activation related to synchronization in high and low loneliness individuals. Using a novel computerized fMRI paradigm, we were able to measure neural activity during naturalistic, live interaction of participating dyads. \n\nOur initial hypothesis regarding the following periods was confirmed, as the high loneliness group showed a lower level of ability to synchronize, which was reflected by their lower following scores in the sync condition. This observation supports previous findings with regard to the social impairments of lonely individuals ( ) and sheds additional light on the underlying mechanisms that may inhibit positive social interaction for lonely individuals. If lonely individuals have difficulties in aligning themselves with others, they will most likely miss out on the social benefits of synchronization such as increased connection, engagement, satisfaction, liking, and affiliation ( ), which in turn may result in their more negative reports of their interactions. \n\nThe neuroimaging findings support the model proposed for interpersonal synchrony ( ). When examining whole-brain activity during synchronization, activations were observed in the IFG and IPL (related to the AO system) as well as in the dmPFC (related to the gap-monitoring system). These findings, which are based on measuring brain activity during a naturalistic and interactive interpersonal synchronization, further strengthen the notion that motor interpersonal synchronization does not involve only sensorimotor components, but that indeed additional neural networks are recruited. Specifically, our study provides support for the existence of the proposed gap-monitoring system, which assists in obtaining synchronization. \n\nIntriguingly, when examining high and low loneliness individuals engaged in active synchronization using the measurement of following periods, high loneliness was related to increased neural activity in the IPL and the IFG. This suggests that high loneliness individuals need to activate their AO system more when they are asked to synchronize their movement, compared to low loneliness individuals. These hyperactivations may be related to social impairment in loneliness. Recently, it was suggested that the AO system contributes not only to motor alignment but also to emotional and cognitive alignment ( ). While this study focused only on motor alignment, these findings could potentially extend to other types of social interaction as well, a notion that should be explored in future studies. Similar findings of AO-increased activation were reported also for other conditions. For example,  ) proposed that hyperactive states of the AO may be related to the social deficits in schizophrenia and to chronic activation and dysregulation of other biobehavioral systems, including the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis (HPA), metabolic, and immune systems. Increased activation of the IFG was also found among individuals with ASD when they were required to identify face targets, despite lower accuracy in the task ( ). This was attributed to an attempt to compensate for an impairment in related cognitive processes due to cortical inefficiency. Similar hyperactivation of the AO was found in multiple studies in ASD (for a recent review, refer to  ). Moreover, previous studies showed that lonely people have a reduction in fractional atrophy of white matter tracts linked to the IFG ( ) as well as decreased white matter density in the IPL ( ), which may further reduce the effectiveness of the AO system. No differences were found in the dmPFC activity between high and low loneliness individuals. This may suggest that while the AO system is hyperactive, there may be an intact gap-monitoring system among lonely individuals. In essence, the results of this study suggest that lonely people may be exerting more neural effort in the AO system; however, despite this, they still achieve less optimal behavioral outcomes ( ). \n  \nProposed model of impaired synchronization in high loneliness individuals. The gap-monitoring system may be functioning properly; however, there appears to be hyperactivation of the AO system, potentially to compensate for the impaired ability. Despite this hyperactivation, lonely individuals still experience difficulties in adapting their movement. \n  \nThe finding that the AO system was hyperactive during following periods among high loneliness individuals could potentially have alternative explanations. Specifically, the IFG and the IPL were also considered parts of neural pathways of inhibitory control (e.g.  ), and it could be claimed that lonelier individuals employ more inhibition during synchronization and this results in the heightened activation of these ROIs. This would be in accordance with the evolutionary theory of loneliness (ETL), which predicts that loneliness will result in a conflict around approach and avoidance ( ;  ). That said, recent studies question the role of these areas in inhibition control (e.g.  ;  ). Therefore, additional studies are required to determine if indeed the activity in these areas may have been related to inhibition. \n\nInvolvement of regions associated with the reward system (OFC, vmPFC, VS), which was also proposed in the interpersonal synchronization model ( ) to be important for the achievement of synchronization through signaling that optimal alignment was achieved, was not identified in this study. This may speak against the involvement of the reward system in movement synchronization, but it is also possible that longer periods of optimal alignment are required to stimulate the reward system. In addition, there is recent evidence that multiband sequences have lower power to detect reward-associated striatal activation ( ). \n\nIt should be noted that contrary to our hypothesis, there were no differences in the zero-lag correlation score between the high and low loneliness groups. While whole-brain analyses confirmed activation of the IFG, IPL, and dmPFC during zero-lag synchronization periods, we did not detect differences between high and low loneliness individuals in the activity of these ROIs during zero-lag synchronization periods. Conversely, group differences were detected for the following periods. This can potentially be attributed to the fact that the zero-lag correlation is a dyad measurement, which does not reflect the individual contribution of each of the dyad members to the synchronization achieved. It is possible that high loneliness individuals contributed less to the synchronization, while their dyad partners compensated for their difficulties, which resulted in intact dyadic performance. We could not effectively test this option because we did not specifically divide dyads according to their loneliness level and thus most dyads in the study consisted of mixed partners. Future studies can further test this possibility by specifically recruiting dyads in which both members report high loneliness versus dyads in which both members report low loneliness. \n\nAs expected, participants\u2019 enjoyment ratings were higher in the sync condition compared to the random condition. However, participants also reported enjoying the free condition more than the random condition. Therefore, it is possible that the increased enjoyment reported was not necessarily due to synchronization, but rather more related to the fact that participants knew they were interacting with a human. Moreover, despite previous accounts of lonely people reporting lower enjoyment from social interaction, and in contrast to our hypothesis, in our study, there were no significant differences in reported enjoyment between the high and low loneliness groups in any of the conditions. While other studies also failed to find a direct relation between enjoyment and loneliness (e.g.  ), it is also possible lonely individuals may have not enjoyed this interaction less since it was a virtual interaction, in which they typically feel more comfortable ( ). In addition, loneliness may be more related to other aspects of the experience, such as level of closeness or satisfaction from the interaction relationship ( ), which were not measured in the current study. \n\nNotably, group differences were specific for loneliness and not observed when we examined related constructs such as depression, autism-like tendencies, or empathy. This further attests to the notion that loneliness is a unique construct, worthy of specific scientific attention ( ;  ). \n\nDuring the free condition, we did not observe spontaneous synchronization, across both loneliness groups. Nonetheless, when examining the brain activity during the entire free condition and contrasting it with the control condition, it was apparent that brain regions relevant to synchronization were recruited, namely the IPL and the PFC. Therefore, it is possible that participants were recruiting the relevant regions but not to an extent that allows actual detectable synchronization. It is conceivable that the observed activations are related to the operation of the default mode network (DMN) ( ;  ), which is closely linked to social cognition ( ;  ). This might explain the difference between the free condition and the random condition as participants knew that they are interacting with another person in the free condition. It is noteworthy that the activations in the PFC during the free condition were more lateral than in the sync condition, including the superior and dorsolateral parts of the PFC. The dlPFC was previously linked to approach\u2013avoidance motivation conflict ( ;  ;  ), and it is possible that this explains the activations during the free condition. \n\nThe finding that the high loneliness group showed a lower level of following in the sync condition was also evident in a significant correlation between loneliness and the following scores in the sync condition. However, differences between high and low loneliness groups in the IPL and the IFG activity during following periods in the sync condition were not significant when using correlations. Given that we used a prestratified parallel-group design and that in general, the UCLA loneliness scale is skewed, with fewer people receiving high scores ( ), a comparison between the two groups may be more accurate. \n\nThe sample in the study was not balanced in terms of sex, with more females participating. While we did not find any significant differences between males and females in loneliness levels, as well as in following scores, enjoyment scores, and zero-lag correlation scores in the sync condition, future studies should strive to examine more thoroughly if the association between loneliness and social synchronization differs between women and men. \n\nReservations concerning the use of a naturalistic paradigm are warranted. While it has benefits in terms of validity and reliability, each participant interacted with a specific participant, and it may be claimed that his or her behavior could be different if he or she were to interact with different participants. To minimize the impact of this issue, we chose to focus on an individual measurement of contribution to the synchronization and the related neural activations and not the dyad measurement. That said, further research may be needed to confirm the findings of the study also in a more controlled setting. In addition, participants performed the task twice, and it could be claimed that this would impact their neural and behavioral results. However, scanning order did not impact any of the behavioral or neuroimaging analyses, and therefore it appears that this does not limit the ability to interpret the results. \n\nIn conclusion, we propose that lonely individuals may have an underlying impairment in interpersonal synchronization. We further propose that this is related to a hyperactivation of the AO system during synchronization, potentially as a compensation attempt for their impaired ability. Our study suggests that despite this hyperactivation, high loneliness individuals still achieve less optimal behavioral outcomes. Building on a model according to which all levels of alignment are related and involve the AO system ( ;  ;  ), we suggest that these difficulties could potentially extend to emotional and cognitive synchronization as well, a hypothesis that future studies could explore. Given the cross-sectional design of our study, our findings do not allow casual inferences about the relationship of loneliness and synchronization. Therefore, our findings cannot determine whether loneliness results in difficulties in synchronization, whether difficulties in synchronization lead to increased loneliness, or whether this is a reciprocal process. However, the findings do suggest that interpersonal synchronization may be a relevant area of intervention to ameliorate loneliness. Interventions focusing on improving lonely individuals\u2019 ability to individually contribute to synchronization may be effective, leading to improvement in the way lonely people experience social interactions and relationships, resulting in increased sense of affinity, closeness, and satisfaction. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9837608, "text_md5": "2050ed4bf20827ef22716d44f85fad04", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 137], "journal": [138, 150], "publication_year": [152, 156], "title": [167, 272], "keywords": [286, 404], "abstract": [417, 1899], "body": [1908, 61549]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 35220424, "doi": "10.1093/cercor/bhac073", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9837608", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9837608"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9837608\">9837608</a>", "list_title": "PMC9837608  Altered activation in the action observation system during synchronization in high loneliness individuals"}

However, while music training is believed to associated with enhancements in certain cognitive and language abilities, studies that have explored the specific relationship between music and executive function have yielded conflicting results. As part of an ongoing longitudinal study, we investigated the effects of music training on executive function using fMRI and several behavioral tasks, including the Color-Word Stroop task. Children involved in ongoing music training (N = 14, mean age = 8.67) were compared with two groups of comparable general cognitive abilities and socioeconomic status, one involved in sports (\u201csports\u201d group, N = 13, mean age = 8.85) and another not involved in music or sports (\u201ccontrol\u201d group, N = 17, mean age = 9.05). During the Color-Word Stroop task, children with music training showed significantly greater bilateral activation in the pre-SMA/SMA, ACC, IFG, and insula in trials that required cognitive control compared to the control group, despite no differences in performance on behavioral measures of executive function. No significant differences in brain activation or in task performance were found between the music and sports groups. The results suggest that systematic extracurricular training, particularly music-based training, is associated with changes in the cognitive control network in the brain even in the absence of changes in behavioral performance. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIt is well documented that music training can be associated with improvements in various cognitive abilities and brain functioning, particularly in the realm of auditory processing [ ]. However, the extent to which learning to play an instrument promotes nonmusical skills is still debated [ ]. Furthermore, the neural mechanisms that could account for such far-transfer effects to non-auditory skills have yet to be clarified. Some researchers have proposed that music training promotes the development of executive function, which, in turn, leads to the enhanced cognitive abilities [ ]. Executive function is generally conceptualized as three interrelated cognitive processes, inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, that, together, allow for goal-directed behavior and cognitive control [ ].   Inhibition  , or   inhibitory control  , is the ability to resist and control one\u2019s attention, behavior, and thoughts that may be habitual or impulsive, often in favor of more appropriate responses.   Working memory   is the ability to keep important and relevant information in mind while simultaneously performing another task.   Cognitive flexibility  , or   task switching  , is the ability to quickly and easily switch between different tasks, incorporating and adjusting to changing demands or new information. These cognitive capacities begin to develop in early childhood and continue to improve through adolescence [ ]. \n\nExecutive functions have been shown to robustly correlate with various metrics of health, achievement, wealth, and quality of life [ ]. The development of cognitive control appears to be particularly predictive of health, success and wellbeing later in life [ ]. Because of this strong association between the development of cognitive control and positive measures of human behavior, a large body of research has focused on investigating the ways in which such skills can be improved, particularly in early childhood. Such studies have shown that executive functions can be enhanced by consistent and intensive cognitive training programs in 7 to 12 year olds [ , ], video game training in older adults [ ], as well as martial arts [ ], mindfulness meditation [ , ], aerobic exercise [ ], and sports training in children between the ages of 5 to 10 [ ]. However, not all of these studies included an active control groups or collected both pre- and post-training measures and thus strong evidence for far-transfer effects associated with training remains limited. \n\nPlaying a musical instrument requires utilizing many of the same cognitive mechanisms that constitute executive functions. During a musical performance, a musician has to continually and seamlessly switch between reading notes, monitoring and adjusting necessary motor actions, and attending to new and competing streams of auditory information coming from other performers as well as one\u2019s own playing [ ]. Given the complexity of playing an instrument, it may not be surprising that studies have reported training-related changes in brain regions involved in both auditory and non-auditory cognitive processes in association with music training [ ]. However, empirical investigations that have specifically tested the hypothesis that music training is associated with enhanced executive functions have reported mixed results and thus, such a link remains elusive. \n\nIt has been proposed that inhibitory control and conflict processing in particular might mediate the transfer of skills from training to cognitive abilities [ ], yet the evidence for this model is weak given the quasi-experimental design of the majority of studies that have assessed the relationship between music training and cognitive control. Several studies have found evidence for enhanced performance on the Stroop task, a commonly-used task of cognitive control [ ], associated with musical expertise. Professional musicians demonstrated faster reaction times on the Color-Word Stroop task than an age-matched group of amateur musicians [ ] and young adults with musical experience demonstrated significantly faster reaction times than non-musicians on both the Simon arrow task and an auditory Stroop task [ ]. Faster reaction times during the auditory Stroop task was also found with older professional musicians compared to non-musicians, though other measures of inhibitory control did not differ between groups [ ]. Both the amount of music training and degree of musical ability have also been shown to correlate with better performance on auditory and visual Stroop tasks [ ]. Furthermore, participants with musical expertise demonstrated better prediction skills when cues were presented aurally, visually, and cross-modally [ ], suggesting that music training might influence one\u2019s ability to predict future events based on previously presented stimuli, a skill believed to be a prerequisite for several cognitive functions and learning. \n\nAdditionally, several studies have reported a relationship between music training and performance on working memory tasks, in particular, verbal working memory [ , ]. On the other hand, a recent cross-sectional study failed to replicate these results, reporting no differences between adult musicians and matched controls on either a working memory task or a visual inhibition task [ ]. Another cross-sectional study did find that musical ability was positively associated with performance on auditory and visual tests of working memory in adults, but it was not associated with performance during tasks that probe inhibition nor task-switching [ ]. \n\nThe relationship between music training and executive function is even less clear in children. In one study, musically trained 9\u201312 year olds scored higher on a measure of IQ and performed better on the Digit Span, a working memory task, than untrained children; however, none of the other executive function tasks were significantly different between the two groups and the association between IQ and music training was not mediated by performance on such tasks [ ]. In a follow-up study, in which amount of music training was assessed continuously rather than as a binary, categorical variable, a significant positive relationship was found between years of music lessons and performance on tasks of executive function that assessed task switching, inhibitory control, and selective attention [ ]. Corroborating these findings, a recent large-scale study reported that improvements from year to year on a visuo-spatial and verbal working memory task were predicted by the amount of time 6\u201325 year olds had spent practicing a musical instrument [ ]. \n\nSeveral factors may account for the inconsistent findings, including a failure to consider potential confounds such as socio-economic status, length and amount of training, and age-related difference, as well as the lack of an active control group that also received training, but in a non-musical activity. In addition, due to the cross-sectional design implemented in the studies mentioned above, it cannot be concluded whether the improvements in executive functions, if present, were primarily the result of music training or if children with pre-existing enhanced cognitive abilities were drawn to music in the first place. Alternatively, both an interest in music and executive function could be promoted by some third, unaccounted-for variable. Longitudinal studies using music-based interventions have the potential to address this issue. Studies assessing executive functions before and after a period of music-based interventions have shown that music training is associated with enhancements in working memory [ , ], performance on an inhibition task [ ], and on a test of attentional control [ ]. A recent longitudinal study with children found that random assignment in an after-school music training program was associated with enhanced performance on several tasks of cognitive control and response inhibition [ ]. However, an effect of music-based interventions on measures of executive function was not replicated in another large-scale study of children between the ages of 6\u201314 [ ]. \n\nNeuroimaging may additionally help clarify the link between music training and executive functions by illuminating structural and functional differences in the brain that may not be captured by behavioral assessments alone. fMRI studies have revealed that the three components of executive function all engage a network of brain regions subserving cognitive control, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and pre-supplementary motor cortex (pre-SMA), precuneus, and insula [ ]. Based on these results, several models have been developed to account for how these brain regions function together to enable successful cognitive control, highlighting the importance of the ACC specifically for such abilities. According to such models, the DLPFC is involved in regulating selective attention, the IFG enables rule representation and task-switching, the ACC serves as a conflict monitor, and the SMA/pre-SMA is required for selecting the appropriate, as well as inhibiting inappropriate, automatic motor actions [ ]. The ACC also appears to be involved in a wide range of cognitive tasks that extend beyond cognitive control. Recent accounts have attempted to unify these extensive findings, arguing that the ACC might be involved in predicting the likelihood of an error [ ] as well as the value of the possible future outcomes of exerting control, rather than monitoring conflict specifically [ ]. \n\nAdditionally, studies have shown that the magnitude of signal change within these regions is correlated with better performance on executive function tasks [ , ]. For example, the degree of engagement of the dorsal ACC during a cognitive control task was found to be correlated with academic achievement in medical students, suggesting a possible neural mechanism by which the development of cognitive control can become associated with positive life outcomes [ ]. Conversely, hypoactivity in the DLPFC, IFG, ACC, SMA and pre-SMA has been observed in clinical populations with known impairments in cognitive control, such as patients with schizophrenia [ ], attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [ ], and drug addictions [ ], though the exact relationship between degree of activation in these regions and cognitive control performance is still a matter of debate [ ]. Overall, previous neuroimaging findings suggest that greater recruitment in this network of brain regions is associated with enhanced cognitive control [ ] and that greater activity in the ACC in particular may be associated with successful conflict processing and resolution [ ]. \n\nTraining-related changes within these regions have also been reported in adults after several weeks of cognitive training on a cognitive control task [ ], in 7\u201311 year-old children after several months of an exercise program [ ], and between 9\u201310 year-old children with high versus low aerobic fitness [ , ]. To our knowledge, however, while various studies have reported an association of early music training with specific changes in brain structure and functioning [ , ], few studies have investigated the neural differences between musicians and non-musicians during tasks that probe cognitive control specifically. One such study found that child musicians (9\u201312 years-old) displayed increased activity bilaterally in the SMA and the IFG during tasks that required rule representation and cognitive flexibility as compared to a control group despite no significant group differences in measures of in-scanner performance of the task [ ]. Another neuroimaging study assessed working memory in adults and found that adult musicians performed better and showed heightened activity in the precentral gyrus, SMA, IFG, insula, and ACC during a working memory task that used musical chords [ ]. Unfortunately, neither of these studies included an active control group and thus it is unclear if music training uniquely impacts executive functions or, if instead, the reported enhancements in executive functions could be produced by any rigorous and socially engaging type of training. \n\nThe goal of the current study was to clarify the connections between music training and executive function in developing children using neuroimaging. As part of a larger, 5-year longitudinal study, we evaluated performance on various measures of executive function and activity in brain regions involved in cognitive control in children engaged in a well-known, standardized music curriculum primarily involving group-based instruction on string instruments (violin and viola). We compared these children (music group) to two matched control groups: one involved in sports training for the same amount of time (sports group), and one not involved in systematic training in either music or sports (control group). The inclusion of the sports group allowed us to assess whether any observed differences are uniquely associated with music training or are associated with involvement in an extra-curricular activity more generally. \n\nBy comparing behavioral performance on tasks of working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility, as well as neural responses during a task of cognitive control between these three groups, we aimed to determine the unique contributions of music training on the development of executive functions. We chose to use an fMRI Color-Word Stroop task because it is well validated in developmental neuroimaging studies of conflict processing [ ] and because of the ambiguity in the literature regarding the nature of the relationship between cognitive control and music training. \n\nWe hypothesized that (1) children who have received systematic music training would perform significantly better on behavioral measures of executive function as compared to the control group with no systematic training in either music or sports; (2) during the Color-Word Stroop task while in the MRI scanner, musically-trained children would show significantly greater recruitment of brain regions consistently reported to be involved in cognitive control, including the IFG, SMA, pre-SMA, ACC, and insula, as compared to the control group. Additionally, we compared behavioral measures of executive function and BOLD signal during the Stroop task between children with music training and children with sports training to evaluate whether the specific auditory, sensorimotor and cognitive skills that are acquired when learning music are associated with additional enhancements above and beyond those that are accounted for by any type of systematic training. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were part of an ongoing longitudinal study addressing the impact of music training on cognitive, socioemotional, and neural development [ ] and were recruited from public elementary schools and community music and sports programs in the greater Los Angeles area. All children were initially recruited at the age of 6, before any training began, and various behavioral measures of cognitive functioning were evaluated at baseline, i.e. before the onset of any systematic training. There were no differences between the groups in age, gender, socioeconomic status, and cognitive abilities at baseline assessment [ ]. \n\nAfter two years, participants completed the first functional MRI scan. The distribution of participants in this study was as follows: Eighteen children (13 boys and 5 girls, 1 left-handed, mean age at the time of scan = 8.69 years, SD = 0.44, age range = 8.08\u20139.42) had been participating in the Youth Orchestra of Los Angeles at Heart of Los Angeles program (hereafter called \u201cmusic group\u201d). Eighteen children (8 boys and 10 girls, 1 left-handed, mean age at the time of scan = 8.94 years, SD = 0.58, age range = 8.00\u201310.08) had been training in a community- based soccer or swimming programs and have not been engaged in any regular musical training; these formed the first control group (hereafter called \u201csports group\u201d). Twenty children (12 boys and 8 girls, 2 left-handed, mean age at the time of scan = 9.05 years, SD = 0.48, age range = 8.33\u20139.92) were recruited from public schools in the same area of Los Angeles provided they were not involved in any systematic, regular after-school training programs and formed the second control group (hereafter called \u201ccontrol group\u201d). At each year of the study, children and their parents were interviewed and asked to report any activities that they had begun to participate in outside of school. While some of the control participants did begin sports programs in subsequent years after the start of the study (a risk inherent to any developmental longitudinal design), on average, the intensity, duration, and regularity of the training programs in the control group after two years was still significantly less than the children in the sports group. \n\nAll three cohorts came from equally under-privileged minority, primarily Latino, communities of downtown Los Angeles. All children were raised in bilingual households, spoke fluent English and attended English speaking schools. Exclusion criteria included any history of psychiatric or neurologic disorders. At the time of initial recruitment, as well as at each follow-up assessment, participants were screened through an extensive parental interview to ensure that they had not developed any condition diagnosed as a developmental or neurological disorder. Clinical assessments were not used for screening. \n\n\n### Description of music and sports after-school programs \n  \n#### Music training program: El Sistema & Youth Orchestra of Los Angeles \n  \nParticipants in the music group took part in an El Sistema-inspired program called the Youth Orchestra of Los Angeles (YOLA), which offers free music training, five days a week, to children from underserved areas of Los Angeles. Acknowledged worldwide as the \u201cmost significant example of collective music education\u201d [ ], El Sistema is claimed by many to be an important mechanism of social change through music [ , ]. Since its inception in 1975, thousands of children, most from underserved communities, have gone through this publicly funded program in Venezuela. Through intensive, collective music learning experiences, El Sistema aims to promote inclusion and combat poverty by empowering at-risk children and youth, and providing them with high quality music learning experiences [ ]. Aligned with the central tenets of El Sistema, YOLA emphasizes ensemble practice and group performances. To join the program, children were selected by lottery, (maximum of 20 per year), from a list of interested families. Once selected, the children were provided with a string instrument, either a violin or viola, which they can take home. The musical curriculum consists of 7 weekly hours of music learning, divided into string instruments, choir, Orff, and musicianship (ear training and theory skills). Practice outside of the program is left at the discretion of students and their parents. Importantly, none of the participants in the music group participated in regularly-scheduled, after-school, sports programs. \n\n\n#### Sports training program \n  \nParticipants in the sports group took part in one of the two following community-based sports programs, free of charge, that serve neighborhoods of downtown Los Angeles: (1) a soccer program which offers soccer training 3 times a week with an additional game each weekend for children aged 6 and older (2) a swimming program which offers free swim instruction 2 times a week to school-age children with an additional recreational swim session each weekend. Each session lasts approximately 1 hour. Participants in both sports programs enrolled voluntarily in their respective programs and both programs were taught by trained coaches. All students who signed up for the sports program were admitted provided they met low socio-economic criteria of the program. Importantly, none of the participants in the sports group participated in any regularly-scheduled, music-based, after-school training programs. \n\nWe selected sports training as a comparison to music because, like music training, it requires investment of time and effort, self-discipline and fosters social engagement. These aspects may, in themselves, promote social, cognitive and neural development. Including such a comparison group helps to specifically identify the beneficial effect of music training on the measures we proposed. \n\n\n\n### Socio-economic status (SES) \n  \nParents indicated their highest level of education and annual household income on a questionnaire. Responses to education level were scored on a 5-point scale: (1) Elementary/Middle school; (2) High school; (3) College education; (4) Master's degree (MA, MS, MBA); (5) Professional degree (PhD, MD, JD). Responses to annual household income were scored on a 5-point scale: (0) < $ 10,000 (1) $10,000 \u2212 $19,999 (2) $20,000\u201329,999 (3) $30,000\u201339,999 (4) $40,000\u201349,999 (5) > $50,000. Parents provided income level and education level at each year of the longitudinal study. For education, the higher of the two reported levels (one for each parent) was used for analysis. Six parents chose not to indicate their income and 6 parents chose not to indicate their education level at the time of the functional scan. For these participants, the income level or education level reported from previous years was used for subsequent analysis. \n\n\n### Experimental procedure \n  \nStudy protocols were approved by the University of Southern California Institutional Review Board. Informed consent for participation in the study was obtained in writing, from the parents/guardians in the preferred language, on behalf of the child participants and verbal assent, during each yearly visit, was obtained from all children individually. Either the guardians or the children could end their participation at any time. Parents/guardians received monetary compensation ($15 per hour) for their child\u2019s participation and children were awarded small prizes (e.g. toys or stickers). Transportation, e.g. taxi vouchers or pre-paid public transportation tickets were provided for the participants if necessary. All children were tested individually at our laboratory at the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern California. \n\n\n### Behavioral assessments \n  \nChildren participated in the study on two separate days. On the first visit, participants completed the MRI, which included the fMRI Color-Word Stroop task, and the parents of participants completed a survey that assessed income and education level as well as their child\u2019s background, typical schedule, and involvement in extra-curricular activities. On the second visit, children completed the behavioral battery (see below), which included the behavioral Color-Word Stroop task outside of the scanner. A description of each task is presented below. \n\n#### Wechsler abbreviated scale of intelligence (WASI-II) \n  \nThe WASI-II for children 6 years and older [ ] was used to assess levels of general intelligence. Subtests included the Block Design, Vocabulary, Matrix Reasoning, and Similarities. In addition, children completed the Memory for Digit Spans (forward and backward) from Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. In the forward condition, the child listened to a sequence of numbers spoken by the experimenter and was instructed to verbally repeat the sequence in the correct order. In the backward condition, the child again listened to a sequence of numbers and was instructed to repeat them in reverse order. In both conditions, the length of the sequence of numbers increased with correct responses until two trials with the same length are answered incorrectly. \n\n\n#### WASI and Digit Span analysis \n  \nAn overall FSIQ score (M = 100, SD = 15) was calculated based on responses from all four subtests of the WASI-II. In addition, a separate Performance IQ (PIQ) was calculated based on only the Block Design and Matrix Reasoning subtests and Verbal IQ (VIQ) was calculated from the Similarities and Vocabulary subtests. These scores measured fluid and crystallized intelligence, respectively. Standardized T scores (M = 50, SD = 10) were also provided for each of the four subtests. Each score was based on norms from a large sample of children living in the US, calibrated separately based on age in three-month increments. \n\nFor the Digit Span, two scores were calculated, one for the forward condition and one for the reverse condition, which reflected the total number of correctly answered trials in each condition. \n\n\n#### Behavioral Color-Word Stroop task \n  \nParticipants performed the Color-Word Stroop task outside the fMRI scanner as a measure of reaction time and accuracy [ ]. The behavioral task was designed to match the fMRI-compatible version as closely as possible. Children were instructed to name, aloud, the color of the ink of the presented word and to ignore the actual written word as quickly and accurately as possible. Participants were also instructed to press the space bar at the same time that they spoke their response. Vocalizations of the response was used over a manual, button-press to avoid additional confounding difficulties associated with mapping color names to finger responses [ ]. The participants completed six separate blocks of the task, where each block consisted of 12 trials of either all congruent trials, in which the color of the word matched the written word, or all incongruent trials, in which the color of the word did not match the written word. Each trial was presented for 1700ms. The task always started with a congruent block. Before the task began, a training session was administered in which the child responded to 5 incongruent trials and 5 congruent trials. The child was unable to advance to the next question until they responded correctly. Each of the 4 ink colors appeared exactly three times in each block, but there were no restrictions on the number of times the written color was presented provided it was not the same as the color of the ink in the incongruent condition. Trials within blocks were randomly permutated to create two unique randomizations (\"A\" and \"B\"). Participants completed either permutation A or B. Stimuli were presented on a MacBook laptop computer using Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) and the Psychophysics Toolbox extension [ , ]. \n\n\n#### Behavioral Color-Word Stroop task analysis \n  \nFor the Color-Word Stroop task, both response time and accuracy were averaged across all blocks of one condition (incongruent or congruent). Response time for each trial was recorded in Matlab when the participant pressed the space bar. Any trial in which the participant did not audibly vocalize the correct color of the ink was marked as incorrect by the experimenter. Any trial in which the participants failed to respond within the allotted time window (1700ms) was additionally considered an incorrect response. Only trials in which the participants responded correctly were included in the measure of average response time. Within each condition, any trial in which the response time was above two standard deviations from the mean of the individual was removed from subsequent analysis. The first trial of each block was removed in subsequent analysis to allow the participants to adjust to the task. A 2 x 3 between-within ANOVA was then conducted in R ( ) to evaluate the effect of condition (incongruent vs. congruent) and group (music, sport, control), as well as the interaction, on both response time and accuracy. \n\n\n#### Hearts and Flowers task \n  \nOutside the scanner, participants also completed the \u201cHearts and Flowers\u201d task, which tests working memory, response inhibition, and task switching/cognitive flexibility [ , ]. The task required participants to press a response button that is either on the same side (congruent) or opposite side (incongruent) of an image. When children saw an image of a heart, they were instructed to press the corresponding directional arrow button on a keyboard. When children saw an image of a flower, they were instructed to press the opposite directional arrow button on the keyboard (see  ). The task consisted of three separate levels that contain only congruent trials (12 trials total), only incongruent trials (12 trials total), and mixed congruent and incongruent trials respectively (33 trials total). For each trial, participants had 750ms to respond. Images were presented on a MacBook laptop computer. Before both the congruent and incongruent trial blocks, a training period was administered which consisted of 5 trials. The child was unable to advance to the next question until they responded correctly. \n   Hearts and Flowers and Flanker Fish tasks.  \n(A) An example of a congruent, heart trial is on the top left, in which the child had to respond with the arrow button that was on the same side of the image, and an example of an incongruent, flower trial is on the bottom left, in which the child had to respond with the arrow button on the opposite side of the image. (B) An example of a trial in the standard condition of the Flanker Fish task is on the top right, in which the child had to respond with the arrow button corresponding to the direction of the middle fish, and an example of a trial in the reverse condition is on the bottom right, in which the child had to press the arrow button corresponding to the direction of the outside fish. \n  \n\n#### Hearts and Flowers task analysis \n  \nFor the Hearts and Flowers task, both response time and accuracy were recorded for each trial. The first trial of each block was removed. Within each condition for each subject, trials were considered incorrect (and subsequently not included in the response time calculations) if the participant did not respond within the allotted amount of time (750ms). Additionally, any trial in which the participant responded faster than 250ms was assumed to be too fast to indicate a reasonable respond and was also not included in response time calculations. Any participant who failed to accurately respond to at least 50% of the congruent trials was removed from the analyses. Ten participants were removed for this reason. In addition, data from 2 participants in the music group were not recorded correctly, which left a total of 13 participants in the control group, 9 in the music group, and 10 in the sports group for the final Hearts and Flowers task analysis. \n\nAnalysis focused on response time and accuracy during the mixed condition in which incongruent and congruent trials were intermixed, as this condition requires utilizing several components of executive function. A 2 x 3 between-within ANOVA was conducted for both response time and accuracy to evaluate group by condition interactions. \n\n\n#### Flanker Fish task \n  \nParticipants also completed a child-friendly version of the Flanker task called the \u201cFlanker Fish\u201d task [ ] which assesses selective attention, task switching, working memory, and inhibitory control. Children were presented with a series of seven fish in a row and were required to press the response button that corresponds to either the direction that the middle fish is facing (standard condition) or the direction that the outside fish are facing (reverse condition). Which task was required was cued based on the color of the fish, with blue fish corresponding to the standard condition and pink fish corresponding to the reverse condition. In some of the trials, all the fish were facing the same direction (congruent condition) and in some of the trials, the outside fish were facing the opposite direction of the middle fish (incongruent condition, see  ). The task also consisted of three separate levels: a standard condition (17 trials total), reverse condition (17 trials total), and mixed condition (45 trials total) in which both standard and reverse trials were presented together. Each trial lasted for 1500ms or until the moment the child presses a response key, whichever came first. Before both the standard and reverse levels, a training period was administered which consisted of 5 trials. The child was unable to advance to the next question until they responded correctly. \n\n\n#### Flanker Fish task analysis \n  \nParticipants and specific trials were removed from analysis based on the same criteria as in the Hearts and Flowers task. Four participants, all from the sports group, incorrectly answered more than 50% of the congruent trials within the mixed flanker condition and were therefore removed from subsequent analysis. A 2x3 between-within ANOVA was conducted separately for response time and accuracy within each condition (standard, reverse, and mixed) to evaluate the interaction of group by condition. \n\n\n\n### Neuroimaging assessment \n  \n#### fMRI Color-Word Stroop task \n  \nThe children performed a modified version of the Color-Word Stroop task designed to be used inside the fMRI scanner [ ]. During each trial, participants were presented with a word on a black screen written in one of four colors (red, yellow, green, or blue) and were instructed to subvocalize the color of the stimulus, regardless of the meaning of the written word, and simultaneously press an arbitrary button on a button box. Subvocalization, in which participants say the color of the ink in their heads rather than out loud, is a commonly used approach in developmental neuroimaging studies of cognitive control [ , ] because it helps minimize movement-related artifacts. On the other hand, the technique makes it inherently difficult to ensure that the participant is correctly completing the task. Therefore, extensive pre-scanning training was conducted and in-scanner response times between the conditions were evaluated to have on objective measure of whether the participant was indeed performing the task. Prior to scanning, participants practiced the task in a lab testing room. First, the child was presented with 3 blocks (1 congruent, 2 incongruent with 4 trials in each) and was instructed to say the color of the written word aloud. Second, the child was presented with 1 incongruent block (4 trials total) and was instructed to say the color of the word in his or her head and simultaneously press a button. \n\nDuring scanning, children completed two functional runs, each containing six blocks. Three blocks consisted of only congruent trials, in which the color of the stimulus and the text of the word matched, and three blocks consisted of only incongruent trials, in which the color of the stimulus and the text of the word did not match ( ). As in the behavioral Stroop task, trials within blocks were pseudorandomized so that each block contained exactly three stimuli of every color. Randomization of trial orders was performed for each participant individually so that each participant saw a different order of stimuli. The blocks consisted of 12 trials, each presented for 1700ms with a 300ms interval between each trial (excluding the last trial in each block). The participants were instructed to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible. Each block was followed by a 16 second rest period (excluding the sixth and final block) for a total scan time of 240 seconds (120 TRs). Response time per condition was averaged for each participant and a between-within ANOVA was conducted to determine if response time was significantly different between conditions and between groups. \n   Color-Word Stroop task fMRI paradigm.  \nExample of a single scanning session of the fMRI Color-Word Stroop task. Each run contained six blocks (three congruent, three incongruent). Each block contained 12 trials (1700ms per trial with a 300ms interval between). Each block was followed by a 16 second rest period for a total scan time of 240s per run. \n  \n\n#### Imaging protocol \n  \nAs part of the longitudinal battery, all children underwent anatomical, diffusion weighted, and functional MR imaging of their brain. Data collection parameters for the structural and functional scans only are described here. \n\nWe designed a child-friendly protocol that included a training session prior to the actual scanning session. Children learned about the scanner by watching a video and became acquainted with a scanning session in a mock scanner by listening to the different types of sound made by the scanner. They also practiced staying still during the mock session. During the actual scanning session, if children wished, one of the investigators remained in the scanner room and held their hand. After the scanning session, children were shown an actual image of their brain on the computer. Children watched a movie of their choice during the anatomical scan to assist them with staying still. \n\nHigh-resolution T1-weighted structural MRI images were acquired using an MPRAGE sequence on a 3T MAGNETOM Prisma System equipped with a 20-channel head coil, with the following parameters: 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm resolution over a 256 mm \u00d7 256 mm \u00d7 256 mm FOV; TI/TE/TR = 850/32.05/2300ms; flip angle = 8\u00b0; GRAPPA acceleration factor   R   = 2. \n\nFunctional images were obtained using a gradient echo, echo-planar, T2*-weighted pulse sequence (TR = 2000 ms, one shot per repetition, TE = 25 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, 64 x 64 in-plane resolution). Forty-one slices covering the entire brain were acquired with a voxel resolution of 3 mm x 3mm x 3mm. One hundred sixty-five volumes were collected during each run of the fMRI Color Stroop task. \n\n\n#### fMRI data analysis \n  \nData were analyzed using FSL (FMRIB\u2019s Software Library;  ). Pre-statistical processing included skull stripping (BET), motion correction (MCFLIRT), slice-timing correction, spatial smoothing (5.0 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel), and high pass temporal filtering (140 seconds). To further minimize effects of head motion, motion scrubbing was conducted for each functional run separately, using root-mean-squares intensity differences (dvars) as the metric of determining which slices should be regressed out in the GLM analysis [ ]. Any slice in which the dvars exceeded the box-plot cutoff (values greater than 75  percentile + 1.5*inter-quartile range) were included in a confound matrix that was subsequently added to the GLM model. \n\nThe two functional runs for each child were combined using a fixed effects analysis. Images were registered to a high-resolution structural and standard space using FLIRT with 12 DOF and a 2-mm MNI template. We modeled the task with a regressor for each of the two conditions (incongruent, congruent) using a boxcar convolved with a double-gamma hemodynamic response function. A general linear model was applied to contrast the BOLD signal between the two conditions of the task. Sessions level models were then combined into a higher level, mixed-effects analysis where independent two-sample t-tests were employed to examine differences in brain activation during these contrasts between the three groups. Given the developmental nature of this study, for all group-level analyses, age at the time of scan was included in the model as a covariate of non-interest. In a separate analysis, differences in response time between the two conditions of the behavioral Stroop task were also included as a covariate of interest. For both models, statistical inference was completed using Z images and FSL\u2019s cluster thresholding, using a cutoff of Z > 2.3, and cluster size probability of p = 0.05. Unthresholded statistical maps were uploaded to NeuroVault.org database and are available at  . \n\nBecause of the known roles of the pre-SMA/SMA, ACC, and IFG in cognitive control [ ], activation of these regions during the Stroop task was further investigated in a region of interest (ROI) analysis. Three spheres with radii of 8 voxels were drawn with the center coordinates located at the peak voxel (-2, 2, 58) within the pre-SMA/SMA, left IFG (-46,30,20), and right ACC (6, 16, 32) based on the significant clusters found in the group-level all subject, incongruent\u2014congruent contrast. Percent signal change in the three ROIs was calculated for all participants from beta values using Featquery in FSL. The values were then correlated with averaged response time and accuracy during the incongruent conditions of the behavioral Stroop task conducted outside of the scanner and corrected for multiple comparisons. Because the neuroimaging data is being correlated with data that was collected outside of the scanner on a separate day, the two measures are independent from one other and thus, this analysis does not constitute \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d [ ]. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographics \n  \nFrom the original 56 participants who completed the fMRI Stroop task, 12 subjects were removed (3 controls, 4 music, 5 sports) due to excessive motion (greater than 3mm mean displacement in either functional run), failure to correctly complete the task, or hardware malfunction, leaving a total of 44 remaining participants: 14 children (6 girls and 8 boys, 1 left handed, mean age at time of scan = 8.67 yrs., SD = 0.42, age range = 8.08\u20139.42) in the music group, 13 children (8 girls and 5 boys, 0 left handed, mean age at time of scan = 8.85 yrs., SD = 0.62, age range = 8.00\u201310.08) in the sports group, and 17 children (6 girls and 11 boys, 2 left handed, mean age at time of scan = 9.05 yrs., SD = 0.44, range = 8.33\u20139.92) in the control group. \n\nAnalysis revealed no significant differences in sex (\u03c7  (2,   N   = 44) = 2.10, p > 0.05, \u03d5 = 0.22), age (F(2, 41) = 2.09, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.09), socio-economic status (  Income  : F(2,41) = 1.51, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.07;   Education  : F(2,35) = 0.82, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.04), IQ (F(2, 41) = 2.23, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.10), or digit span (  Forward  : F(2,41) = 0.87, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.04;   Backward  : F(2,41) = 1.11, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.05) between the three groups and therefore these factors were not included in the subsequent analyses on behavioral performance. Age was included as a covariate for the fMRI analyses only. All demographic information is presented in  . \n   Participant characteristics.      \n\n### Executive functioning behavioral results \n  \n#### Behavioral Color-Word Stroop task \n  \nThe between-within ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of condition on accuracy (F(1, 41) = 37.78, p < 0.001, \u03b7  = 0.32). Average accuracy during the incongruent trials was significantly lower than accuracy during the congruent trials for all three groups [  control  : t(16) = 2.94, p < 0.05;   music  : t(13) = 5.13, p < 0.001;   sports  : t(12) = 5.24, p < 0.001]. There was no significant interaction between group and condition (F(2,41) = 0.29, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.01) or main effect of group (F(2,41) = 1.58, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.04). \n\nA significant main effect of condition was also found for response time (F(1, 41) = 199.85, p < 0.001, \u03b7  = 0.48). Response times during the incongruent trials were significantly longer than during the congruent trials for all three groups [  control  : t(16) = -9.41, p < 0.001;   music  : t(13) = -9.51, p < 0.001;   sports  : t(12) = -5.91, p < .001]. There was no significant interaction between group and condition (F(2,41) = 1.25, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.01) nor a significant main effect of group (F(2,41) = 1.18, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.04). The results are presented in  . \n   Mean accuracy and response time during both the behavioral and fMRI Color-Word matching Stroop task.        \n\n#### Hearts and Flowers task \n  \nAccuracy during the hearts (congruent) condition was significantly higher than the accuracy during the flowers (incongruent) condition (  hearts  : M = 0.98, S.D = 0.04;   flowers  : M = 0.86, S.D. = 0.12, t(41) = 6.08, p < 0.001). Response time was also significantly faster in the heart (congruent) condition, than the flower (incongruent) condition (  hearts  : M = 408.97ms, S.D = 66.58ms;   flowers  : M = 550.24ms, S.D. = 89.95ms, t(41) = -11.50, p < 0.001). \n\nIn the mixed condition, neither accuracy nor response time were significantly different between hearts and flowers trials (  accuracy  : F(1,29) = 0.59, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.01;   response time  : F(1,29) = 2.53, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.01) nor was there a significant interaction effect with group (  accuracy  : F(2,29) = 0.35, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.01;   response time  : F(2,29) = 0.40, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.002). The results are presented in  . \n   Mean accuracy and response time during the three conditions of the Hearts and Flowers task.        \n\n#### Flanker Fish task \n  \nIn the Standard Flanker Fish, a marginally significant main effect of condition was found for accuracy (F(1,34) = 3.22, p = 0.08, \u03b7  = 0.04) and a significant a main effect of condition was found for response time (F(1,34) = 7.58, p < 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.06). In general, participants were more accurate (marginal) and faster during the congruent conditions within the Standard Flanker task ( ). No group by condition interaction was found for either accuracy (F(2,34) = 0.41, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.012) or response time F(2, 34) = 0.56, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.008). \n   Mean accuracy and response time during the three conditions of the Flanker Fish task.        \nIn the Reverse Flanker Fish task, a main effect of condition was found for accuracy (F(1,34) = 37.41, p < 0.001, \u03b7  = 0.34) and for response time (F(1,34) = 4.53, p < 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.02) wherein participants were more accurate and faster in the incongruent trials ( ). Again, no significant interaction effects for either with group (  accuracy  : F(2,34) = 0.24, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.01);   response time  : F(2, 34) = 2.08, p> 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.02). \n\nIn the Mixed Flanker Fish task, a main effect of condition was found with both accuracy (F(1,33) = 131.53, p < 0.001, \u03b7  = 0.60) and response time (F(1,33) = 13.57, p < 0.001, \u03b7  = 0.11), indicating that participants were faster and more accurate on the congruent trials than the incongruent trials within the Mixed task. However, a significant group by condition interaction was not found for either accuracy (F(2,33) = 1.01, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.02) nor response time (F(2,33) = 2.32, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.04). \n\n\n#### fMRI Stroop task \n  \nFor response times during the Color-Word Stroop task inside the scanner, a significant main effect of condition was found (F(1,41) = 26.93, p < 0.001, \u03b7  = 0.16), where average response time to congruent trials was faster than response time to incongruent trials. The group by condition interaction was not significant, however (F(2,41) = 0.67, p > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.01). To verify the Stroop effect, we evaluated response times between the two conditions (congruent and incongruent) within each group using paired t-tests. Response times during the incongruent condition were significantly longer in both the music (  incongruent  : M = 910ms, SD = 180ms;   congruent  : M = 740ms, SD = 150ms; t(13) = -4.52, p < 0.001) and sports group (  incongruent  : M = 910ms, SD = 150ms;   congruent  : M = 690ms, SD = 140ms; t(12) = -3.28, p < 0.05), but not the control group (  incongruent  : M = 790ms, SD = 200;   congruent  : M = 690ms, SD = 140ms; t(16) = -2.01, p > 0.05) when correcting for multiple comparisons using a Bonferroni correction ( ,  ). \n   Response times inside the scanner during fMRI Color-Word Stroop task for each condition by group.  \nResponse time is measured in seconds. Error bars represent standard error. \n  \n\n\n### Whole brain fMRI results \n  \nWhole-brain analysis for the contrast incongruent conditions > congruent conditions revealed significant signal differences in all three groups bilaterally in the pre-SMA/SMA and ACC as well as in the left precentral gyrus, anterior insula, IFG, and posterior intraparietal sulcus ( ,  ). Musicians, as compared to the control group, showed significantly greater BOLD signal difference between the incongruent and congruent conditions bilaterally in the pre-SMA/SMA, precentral sulcus, insula, ACC, IFG, lateral occipital cortex, and cerebellum ( ,  ). The opposite contrast of control group over music group revealed no significant differences in BOLD signal. \n   Whole brain activation for incongruent > congruent trials of the fMRI Color-Word Stroop task for all three groups.  \nRed to yellow corresponds to positive z-values. Images are cluster thresholded at Z > 2.3 and cluster size threshold of p < 0.05. \n     Whole brain activation for incongruent > congruent trials of the fMRI Color-Word Stroop task in a two-sample comparison of music group greater than control group.  \nRed to yellow corresponds to positive z-values. Images are cluster thresholded at Z > 2.3 and cluster size threshold of p < 0.05. \n     Significant clusters for incongruent > congruent trials of the fMRI Color-Word Stroop task.        \nWhen comparing the music group with the sports group, no significant differences were found in brain regions that are part of the cognitive control network. The music group did show a significantly greater difference in signal change in the left occipital cortex than the sports group in the incongruent > congruent contrast. The reverse comparison (sports > music) and the comparison of the sports group with the control group revealed no significant voxels. \n\nIn the model that included differences in response times during the two conditions of the behavioral Color-Word Stroop task completed outside of the scanner, BOLD signal was not found to be significantly correlated with response time. Adding this covariate to the model did not change the pattern of results regarding the group differences and were therefore not presented. \n\n\n### Percent signal change in ROI \n  \nThe difference in BOLD signal between the music and control group during the Stroop task was further evaluated in an ROI analysis. The percent signal change in regions of interest in the pre-SMA/SMA, left IFG, and left ACC for each contrast revealed that the music group had greater BOLD signal in these regions during incongruent blocks than both the control and sports group ( ). \n   Percent signal change in the pre-SMA/SMA, left IFG and right ACC for the incongruent > congruent contrast during the Color-Word Stroop task by group.  \nRegion was defined by the peak voxel within significant clusters. Error bars represent standard error. \n  \nGiven that no differences in behavioral measures of response inhibition were found between the three groups, we attempted to better understand the differences in fMRI by correlating the percent signal change in regions found to be significantly activated by the task with the behavioral measures outside of the scanner. Accuracy and response time during the incongruent trials of the behavioral Color-Word Stroop task, trials in which response conflict was present [ ], were correlated with percent signal change in the pre-SMA/SMA, right ACC, and left IFG across all participants. Again, because BOLD signal during the conditions of the Stroop task was correlated with accuracy and response time measured on a separate day, outside of the scanner, we avoid any nonindependency issues [ ]. \n\nAverage accuracy during incongruent trials was positively correlated with percent signal change between incongruent and rest blocks in the left IFG (r = 0.34, p = 0.03) and pre-SMA/SMA (r = 0.30, p = 0.05), but not in the right ACC (r = 0.19, p = 0.22; see  ,  ). However, neither of the significant correlations at p < 0.05 survived correcting for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, neither response time during the incongruent trials nor the difference in response time between incongruent and congruent trials were significantly correlated with percent signal change in any of the regions of interest. \n   Pearson correlations of percent signal change between conditions of the fMRI Color-Word Stroop task in three regions of interest (pre-SMA/SMA, right ACC, and left IFG) during the and performance on the Behavioral Color-Word Stroop task outside of the scanner.           Linear regression plots between accuracy on incongruent trials of the behavioral Color-Word Stroop task and percent signal change in the (A) left IFG, (B) pre-SMA/SMA, and (C) right ACC for the incongruent > congruent contrast during the fMRI Color-Word Stroop task.  \nNo correlations were significant after correction for multiple comparisons. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe results from our study contribute to the growing body of literature proposing a connection between music training and executive functions. By utilizing several behavioral tasks that disentangle the various components of executive function and two matched control groups that were shown to have equal cognitive abilities prior to onset of training, we were able to evaluate the relationship between early childhood music training and the functioning of brain networks involved in executive functions. Despite the absence of behavioral differences in performance on tasks of response inhibition, working memory, or task switching, we found that children with two years of music training displayed a greater difference in BOLD signal in brain regions involved in conflict processing when compared to a control group that had received no systematic training. \n\nIn all participants, incongruent versus congruent trials of the Color-Word Stroop task were associated with activity in a network of brain regions that are known to be involved in cognitive control, including the bilateral pre-SMA/SMA and ACC, as well as the left precentral gyrus, anterior insula, and IFG [ ]. Comparing the music group to the control group that did not receive systematic training, we found significantly greater BOLD signal in the music group located bilaterally in the IFG, pre-SMA/SMA, ACC, precentral gyrus, and insula when contrasting incongruent blocks with congruent blocks of the Color-Word Stroop task. Because we did not have a direct measure of performance inside the scanner and behavioral measures on the task did not differ between the three groups, it is difficult to interpret the significance of these findings in terms of the unique connection between music training and executive functions. Considering these limitations, in what follows, we discuss the potential significance of the neural differences between the music and control group in terms of the hypothesized role that each of these regions plays in cognitive control. \n\nThe SMA and pre-SMA are structurally and functional connected to the IFG [ , ] and appear necessary for self-initiated actions [ ] as well as motor response inhibition [ ]. The pre-SMA is consistently found to be more active during incongruent trials of the Stroop task [ ]. SMA and pre-SMA activity is observed when comparing participants with shorter reaction times to those with longer-reaction times on a Stop-signal task [ ] and patients who have lesions primarily in these areas have impaired performance on similar tasks [ ]. Children with ADHD have shown reduced fMRI signal in the pre-SMA during a Go/No-Go task [ , ] as well as decreased cortical thickness in the medial frontal wall that includes the pre-SMA[ ], indicating that atypical functioning in the pre-SMA/SMA may be central to deficits in response selection and inhibition seen in certain clinical populations [ ]. \n\nIn our study, the music group showed significantly greater recruitment of both the pre-SMA and SMA during cognitive control. These findings are consistent with previous research that found greater pre-SMA and SMA engagement in both adult and child musicians as compared to controls during a task that probed components of executive function [ , ]. This result may therefore indicate early changes in the cognitive control network in children with several years of music training, particularly in the regions involved in selecting appropriate responses and inhibiting reflexive, inappropriate responses. \n\nThe ACC is frequently cited as being involved in cognitive control [ \u2013 ], though recently the anatomical and functional distinctions between the ACC and the pre-SMA/SMA have been a topic of debate in the literature (see [ ]. In our results, the significant voxels appear on both the dorsal and ventral side of the cingulate sulcus, which is considered the anatomical boundary between the two regions [ ]. We therefore labelled the voxels on the ventral side as belonging to the pre-SMA/SMA and voxels on the dorsal side as part of the ACC. \n\nIn terms of the specific role of the ACC in cognitive control, the region may be thought of as a conflict monitor: detecting a conflict when it is present and sending a signal to other regions and networks, such as the SMA/pre-SMA, to resolve it [ ]. ACC activity was shown to be related to efficient response inhibition only when the trials that required inhibition were frequent, and thus less salient, whereas pre-SMA activity was related to efficient response inhibition regardless of the frequency of conflict trials [ ]. Furthermore, activity in the ACC during a Stroop task was positively correlated with age and performance on the task [ ] and activity in this region appears to underlie the link between cognitive control abilities and academic success [ ]. During an fMRI Color-word Stroop task, we found that children with music training demonstrated increased activity in the ACC as compared to the control children with no music training, which may reflect increased recruitment of the cognitive control network. Speculatively, this may suggest that music training can become linked to the development of various cognitive skills by reinforcing the neural mechanisms in place for saliency detection and conflict monitoring. However, given that this study did not find any behavioral improvement, nor a neural difference between music and sports group, follow-up testing will be needed to validate this link and assess whether music training is unique in its ability to alter the network involved in cognitive conflict. \n\nMore recent accounts of ACC functioning emphasize its role in predicting the likelihood of an event or potential outcome and updating the systems for creating expectations in the future [ ]. Given that playing a musical instrument involves adjusting responses to match expected outcomes and actions, and the findings that music training might be associated with cross-modal prediction [ ], it may be that this increased ACC activity associated with a task of cognitive conflict in the music group is indicative of an enhanced ability to predict conflict likelihood and/or assess the value of exerting control necessary to resolve the conflict at hand. \n\nThe IFG, in the right hemisphere in particular, appears to be crucial for inhibitory control and conflict processing [ ]. Part of the ventral attention network, the inferior frontal cortex is believed to orient attention towards salient and behaviorally relevant information [ ]. Successful stop trials on the stop-signal task, as compared to unsuccessful stop trials, activates the right IFG [ ] and patients with lesions in the right IFG displayed worse performance on the task [ ]. Moreover, performance on the Go/No-go task is correlated with measures of white matter integrity in the right IFG [ ] and children with ADHD [ ] and autism [ ], two clinical populations with well-documented impairments in cognitive control, displayed hypoactivation in the right IFG during various tasks that require response inhibition. Greater IFG involvement during an inhibition task may therefore reflect additional attentional processing required of conflict trials, ultimately serving to allocate the resources necessary for successful motor inhibition [ ]. \n\nFurthermore, previous studies have shown involvement of right IFG during control tasks in adults but not children [ ] suggesting that right IFG prominence during cognitive control may emerge later in development [ ]. Right IFG involvement during the Stroop task was only found in the music > control group-level contrast. We speculate that the increased recruitment of the right IFG observed in the music training group, which was not observed in the control group, could indicate an early shift in the cognitive control neural network from the left to the right IFG, a process that appears to occur naturally with age [ ]. \n\nBOLD signal in the insula has also been shown to be positively correlated with task performance during cognitive control [ ]. On the other hand, several studies have observed greater activity in the insula after unsuccessful trials [ ] as well as during trials in which participants took longer to respond [ ]. These results suggest that the insula may not be directly involved in the inhibition of a motor response, but rather reflect a participant\u2019s level of motivation or focus during the task [ ]. In this view, the insula generates the negative affective response associated with making a mistake, which, in turn, leads to added incentive to perform well in future trials [ ]. This is in line with the insula\u2019s well-documented role more generally in detecting salient events and initiating the appropriate behavioral responses [ ], as well as in feelings of uncertainty that stem from decision-making [ ]. The significant difference of BOLD signal in the insula observed in the music group, but not the control group, might therefore indicate that early childhood training is associated with improved monitoring of emotional responses during conflict processing, which fosters more successful actions and decisions in the future. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nAlthough we are interpreting the fMRI findings as evidence for more advanced and effective conflict processing in the music group compared to the control group, we recognize that some investigators have argued that increased activation of cortico-striatal regions during control or inhibition tasks is indicative of greater cognitive conflict [ ]. BOLD signal in the left IFG has been found to be is greater in older adults who perform more poorly on the Stroop task [ ]. Moreover, ACC activity has been observed during tasks that require higher cognitive load [ ]. Given these results, it may be that the greater activation in these regions observed in the music group reflects increased effort required to resolve the conflict, whereas decreased activation reflects more efficient invocation of the networks needed to implement cognitive control [ ]. Without a measure of task performance inside the scanner, we recognize that we cannot be certain that our findings do not indicate lower efficiency in cognitive control regions in the music group. However, given that the percent signal change in the pre-SMA/SMA and left IFG during the response inhibition trended towards being significantly correlated with higher accuracy on incongruent trials of the behavioral Stroop task, we reason that the greater difference in activity in cortico-striatal structures and the recruitment of the right IFG observed in the music group more likely reflect improvements in cognitive control. \n\nAn alternative hypothesis that was not addressed in this study, is the role of motivation on executive functioning tasks. Previous findings suggest that positive motivation enhances cognitive control [ ] and that activity in the medial and lateral frontal cortex during cognitive control tasks were greater for high versus low reward conditions [ ]. Though response time during the Stroop task did not significantly differ by group, the fact that the music group still demonstrated longer response times on the task could be reflective of increased motivation or self-discipline to perform the task correctly. Furthermore, in this study, we do not have a direct measure of how motivated the children were to participate in their respective extracurricular activities and we therefore cannot rule out the possibility that the neural differences found could pertain to increased engagement with and commitment to the training programs, rather than a unique property of the training itself. We hope to include a measure of motivation in subsequent follow-up assessments. \n\nWe chose a block design for the fMRI portion of this study to simplify the task for our participants, which we acknowledge has certain limitations. Other researchers have suggested that an event-related design is more appropriate with the Stroop task inside the scanner because it allows for intermixing conditions and is less susceptible to habituation to the task, resulting in more robust activation maps associated with the Stroop-effect [ ]. However, similar Stroop effects have been reported using block-designs [ ]. Because of this, and given the age of our participants at baseline, we decided to use the easier task that does not require task-switching inside the scanner. Future studies with a different cohort of children may be able to use an event-related design with more extensive pre-training. \n\nDespite finding differences in BOLD signal between the music group and control group, no differences were found in either response time during the fMRI task or in accuracy/response time during the behavioral executive function tasks outside of the scanner. We are not the first to report differences between groups in neural pathways involved in executive function in the absence of behavioral differences [ , , , ]. As other researchers have proposed, differences in brain responses in the absence of behavioral differences could be the result of varying cognitive strategies used to complete the task [ ]. Alternatively, the lack of behavioral findings could be due to the low statistical power stemming from the relatively small number of participants in each group and the relatively low amount of trials in each task. We additionally had to remove data from several participants based on poor performance during the task, which can commonly occur due to fatigue, boredom, and/or difficulty in understanding and following instructions. We recognize the drawbacks of conducting a study aimed at assessing three groups of developing children on a wide range of tasks that probe both cognitive and socio-emotional development, such as limited sample size, limited time dedicated to each task, and difficulties with task compliance. That being said, while the lack of group differences on performance during the Stroop task both inside and outside of the scanner makes an interpretation of the fMRI findings more difficult, based on the findings from previous neuroimaging studies on the development of executive function as well as our own findings of a positive correlation between signal change in both the pre-SMA/SMA and left IFG and performance on the behavioral Stroop task, we speculate that our neuroimaging result suggest early changes in pathways involved in executive function that behavioral measures of inhibitory control are not sensitive enough to detect. \n\nFurthermore, no significant neural or behavioral differences were found between the music group and the sports group, suggesting that any type of training in which a child focuses on developing a particular skill through repeated practice may be associated with change in the neural organization of networks involved in cognitive control. Playing a sport as well as a musical instrument both require cognitive planning, switching attention between various tasks, keeping information in working memory, and executing and inhibiting fine motor actions [ ]. Other mechanisms could additionally account for far-transfer effects of both types of training, such as the self-discipline and self-motivation that is required to learn a new skill, or the social interactions that come with working together to achieve some larger goal. However, we are cautious to interpret these null findings as evidence for far-transfer effects associated with sports training. Given that no differences were found between the sports group and control group either, it may be that music training does influence conflict processing more robustly than sports training, but, because children in all groups were developing naturally with age, differences are only detectable on the extreme ends of the spectrum and the sports group fell somewhere in the middle. Still, it is quite possible that neural differences do exist between the music and sports group that are not detectable here due to the small sample size of each group and low statistical power. Given these limitations, it remains difficult to conclude that music training impacts the development of executive functions more so than other types of engaging and demanding activities in childhood. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nTo summarize, after two years of community, group-based music training, children showed significantly greater differences in the cognitive control network during the Color-Word Stroop task as compared to a control group that was not involved in any systematic afterschool activities. Performance on several behavioral tasks of executive function did not vary by group, though there is modest evidence that the degree of activation of these regions increased with better performance on a behavioral Stroop task. The results from this study provide support for the hypothesis that learning to play a musical instrument can impact brain networks that enable executive functioning, which, in turn, may mediate the link between music training and enhanced cognitive abilities [ ]. Given that we did not find any differences in behavioral measures of executive functioning, it may be that functional imaging is uncovering early development of neural systems that have not yet manifested into measurable changes on behavioral tasks. In addition, no significant differences in BOLD signal during the Stroop task were found between the music group and a group of children that received an equal amount of sports training nor between the sports and control group. Therefore, while music training may indeed influence the development of neural systems involved in cognitive control, the results from this study cannot rule out the possibility that other types of focused, challenging, and repeated training may do so as well. Continued examination of the same participant population over the next few years will hopefully yield answers to these outstanding questions. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5662181, "text_md5": "b31833c0a0dceb2374f37ce4d22b0079", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 77], "journal": [78, 86], "publication_year": [88, 92], "title": [103, 226], "keywords": [240, 240], "abstract": [253, 1811], "body": [1820, 72248]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 29084283, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0187254", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5662181", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5662181"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5662181\">5662181</a>", "list_title": "PMC5662181  Increased engagement of the cognitive control network associated with music training in children during an fMRI Stroop task"}

Although research in\u00a0neuroscience suggests that the values of hedonic and utilitarian goods are similarly represented, it remains largely unknown how these values are mapped during purchasing decisions or task-irrelevant judgments. It has been suggested that people rely more on hedonic (vs. utilitarian) factors when making task-irrelevant judgments, and that this is amplified by trait-reward seeking. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can directly measure the mental processes involved in explicit or task-irrelevant value judgments. Using fMRI, we found that the explicit value of hedonic and utilitarian goods was commonly processed in the ventral striatum. In contrast, no significant results were obtained in common neural processing of task-irrelevant hedonic and utilitarian value. Additionally, we did not find any evidence that trait-reward seeking modulates task-irrelevant hedonic (vs. utilitarian) value processing. Our findings show that the value of both hedonic and utilitarian goods is commonly represented in the ventral striatum, and indicate that the value construct underlying consumer purchases is unidimensional. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nBoth affective and cognitive (functional and instrumental need-related) factors can play a role in purchasing decisions. You may, for example, buy a bar of chocolate because you want to feel happy when eating the delicious chocolate, or you may buy bug killer to avoid negative emotions. In contrast, you may buy a microwave because it is useful rather than for affective gratification; therefore, the decision is cognitively-based. Purchases can also involve both affective and cognitive factors. \n\nThe value of goods may be automatically processed. Imagine that you are walking into a shopping mall. You may see many items, including goods you buy for affective reasons (e.g., junk food, movies, or concert tickets), as well as ones that you buy for cognitive reasons (e.g., detergent, a washing machine, or vitamin tablets). You may see and pass almost all of these products without scrutinizing their value. Nevertheless, you may consider the value of goods even though you do not have to do so\u2014perhaps automatically. \n\nThe focus of the present research is the role of goods-induced and trait affect in unconscious value processing. Although recent neuroscience findings suggest that the values of hedonic and utilitarian goods are represented in the same brain regions , it remains unknown how these values are mapped during task-irrelevant judgments (when explicit economic evaluations are not required). The affect-cognition theory suggests that affective reactions can be processed faster during automatic judgments, and that affective processing predominates . Moreover, a chronic (i.e., trait) reward orientation is thought to be necessary to generate predominant automatic processing of affective value . However, it remains unknown how consumers automatically value goods based on goods-induced and trait affect. \n\nRecent advances in neuroscience, and particularly in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), enable researchers to investigate these issues. Neural data captured by fMRI have unique advantages for investigating research questions pertaining to consumer behaviors such as (1) distinguishing among different psychological processes, (2) measuring task-irrelevant consumer behaviors, and (3) understanding the biological origins of individual differences in consumer behaviors . fMRI can track mental activity reflected in neural responses in real-time consumer decision processes. The characteristics of fMRI rely less on self-reporting, and reduce concerns about response biases such as social desirability, memory distortion, and fabrication. Additionally, fMRI provides better spatial resolution than many other neuroscientific methods (e.g., EEG, fNIRS, or MEG), and thus it can reliably measure activities in deep brain structures such as value-related mesolimbic regions (e.g., the ventral striatum). \n\nIn this study, our goal was to clarify value processing of consumer goods in the brain. We empirically tested how (1) consumers explicitly and task-irrelevantly encode the values of goods with affect-based and cognitively- based appeal and (2) how the related trait (reward sensitivity) modulates the task-irrelevant value signals of affectively- vs. cognitively-based goods using fMRI. \n\n\n## Theoretical Background \n  \n### Hedonic and utilitarian goods \n  \nConsumer choices are based on two distinct motives for buying . The value of some products (e.g., chocolate) is hedonically- (i.e., affectively-) based, whereas other products (e.g, microwaves) are valued for utilitarian reasons (i.e., they serve functional and instrumental needs) . We refer to the former as hedonic goods and the value they are accorded as hedonic value. Hedonic goods provide emotional experiences such as joy, excitement, fun, and pleasure . Hedonic goods have high levels of hedonic dimension attributes (and lower levels of utilitarian dimension attributes). Hedonic goods include sports cars, fashionable clothes, and action movies. Conversely, we refer to goods purchased because of their utility as utilitarian goods, and the value they are accorded as utilitarian value. Utilitarian goods meet functional and instrumental needs, and their attractive features are more utilitarian than hedonic . Utilitarian goods include products such as microwaves and vacuum cleaners . When people purchase utilitarian goods, they place emphasis on their usefulness, convenience, and functionality, not their affective features. \n\n\n### Neural common currency hypothesis \n  \nA growing body of neuroscience research supports a neural common currency hypothesis. The notion is that specific brain regions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (ventromedial prefrontal cortex [PFC] and ventral striatum [VS]) encode consumers\u2019 valuations of different types of goods . vmPFC and VS activity increases when participants view purchased goods, as compared to when they do not . In addition, vmPFC activity while viewing goods was positively correlated with the amount of money the consumer was willing to pay for the goods being viewed . The neural pattern of the vmPFC also encoded the value of different types of goods . Moreover, meta-analyses have shown that the vmPFC and VS are involved in value-related decisions . Therefore, the vmPFC and VS may track overall stimulus value during a shopping decision. The neural common currency hypothesis suggests that the vmPFC and VS encode all types of value during the purchasing of goods. \n\nH1: Value signals for both hedonic and utilitarian goods are commonly processed in specific brain regions (the vmPFC and VS) during purchasing. \n\n\n### Task-irrelevant consumer value \n  \nFor a better understanding of consumer value, we should clarify how hedonic and utilitarian values are affected by explicit vs. task-irrelevant value judgments. Explicit value judgments occur during typical shopping decisions, whereas task-irrelevant value judgments are automatic evaluations. Consumers assess the value of goods even when they do not have to do it . People automatically allocate attention to task-irrelevant items associated with a reward  and, therefore, engage in task-irrelevant economic evaluations\u2014i.e., evaluations not associated with purchasing decisions. However, it remains unknown how the values associated with hedonic and utilitarian goods that are not being considered for purchase are represented. \n\n\n### Neural common currency hypothesis: Is the task-irrelevant value of hedonic and utilitarian goods assessed along the same dimension? \n  \nThe neural common currency hypothesis suggests that hedonic and utilitarian values share the same dimension during task-irrelevant value judgments. As with explicit value judgments, the vmPFC may encode both hedonic and utilitarian values during value-irrelevant judgments. A previous study used a passive viewing paradigm, and participants viewed goods in an MRI scanner. The participants then indicated whether they wanted to purchase the goods. vmPFC activity predicted whether participants bought the goods . Another study had participants engage in cognitive tasks in which they were not required to value goods. The results show that valuation regions such as vmPFC and other limbic regions are related to task-irrelevant economic values . Moreover, one study employing various stimuli (e.g., faces, houses, or paintings) shows that activation of the vmPFC, VS, and other regions is positively correlated with the value of stimuli when participants see and rate the age of the stimuli (they did not have to value the goods) . Although these previous studies do not differentiate between hedonic and utilitarian goods, their results suggest that hedonic and utilitarian values are both assessed in value-related regions (vmPFC and VS) during task-irrelevant value judgments. \n\nH2: Value signals of both hedonic and utilitarian goods are commonly processed in specific brain regions (the vmPFC and VS) during value-irrelevant judgments. \n\n\n### The task-irrelevant value of hedonic (vs. utilitarian) goods may be amplified \n  \nTask-irrelevant economic valuations may predominantly occur for hedonic goods . The value of hedonic goods can be based on positive arousal (a combination of positive valence and high arousal), because hedonic attitudes reflect both valence (e.g., fun, enjoyment) and arousal (e.g., excitement, thrilling) . According to the affect-cognition model, affective reactions occur in a relatively automatic manner, even if processing resources are not directed to the task . In contrast, choice of products is not influenced by hedonic features when processing resources are unlimited . The affect-integration-motivation framework also indicates that activity in brain regions related to positive arousal (ventral striatum: VS) occurs first, followed by further value representation (vmPFC). Previous studies show that people allocate their attention to task-irrelevant stimuli with positive arousing features, such as money , emotional pictures , or tasty foods , even when they do not have to focus on the stimuli. These findings indicate that task-irrelevant value signals are more likely to be encoded in the vmPFC and VS for hedonic than for utilitarian goods. \n\nH3: Value signals for hedonic goods are more likely to be encoded in the vmPFC and VS than those for utilitarian goods. \n\n\n### The task-irrelevant hedonic (vs. utilitarian) value may be amplified by behavioral activation system \n  \nThe value of task-irrelevant hedonic goods is likely to be amplified by the intensity of approach to rewarding stimuli. The affect-integration-motivation framework indicates that approach motivation mediates the relationship between preceding positive arousal and further evaluations . It has been also shown that positive arousal may be linked to both approach motivation and reward . We propose that individual differences in motivation to approach rewarding cues (i.e., in the Behavioral Activation System [BAS]) moderate the effect of goods type and/or judgment modes on value responsiveness. \n\nValue responsiveness is greater with increased levels of approach motivation when the judgment mode is task-irrelevant (vs. explicit) and goods are hedonic (vs. utilitarian). Gray advocated for a reinforcement sensitivity theory of personality. According to the theory, the BAS encodes individual differences in sensitivity to rewarding stimuli. The BAS regulates approach motivation and goal-directed behavior to attain rewards (e.g., Gray, 1994). The biological substrate of the BAS is thought to comprise brain areas belonging to dopaminergic systems such as the vmPFC and VS. Previous studies suggest that personality traits affect choice of hedonic (vs. utilitarian) goods when the judgment mode is relatively task-irrelevant. Individuals with a more reactive BAS tend to show an automatic processing bias that is susceptible to priming of hedonic goods (i.e., high-fat foods) . Given the role of the BAS in (automatic) affective reactions, the BAS modulates evaluations of hedonic goods more than utilitarian goods during task-irrelevant judgments, but not during explicit judgments. \n\nH4: When value judgments are task-irrelevant (vs. explicit), value responsiveness to hedonic goods (greater activity in the VS and vmPFC) is positively related to BAS reward sensitivity. \n\n\n### The current study \n  \nIn this study, we aimed to understand value processing of consumers using fMRI. It remains unknown how consumers explicitly or automatically value goods based on goods-induced and trait affect. Therefore, we investigated how values of hedonic and utilitarian goods are represented in the brain during (1) shopping and (2) task-irrelevant judgments and (3) how trait reward sensitivity (i.e., BAS) modulates this process. Participants performed two decision-making tasks with the same hedonic and utilitarian goods across tasks. They made purchasing decisions (for which values are directly explicit) or perceptual decisions (for which values are unrelated to the purchasing decisions and, therefore, task-irrelevant). This protocol allowed us to investigate the value representations of hedonic and utilitarian goods during task-irrelevant (vs. explicit) judgments, as well as how the BAS modulates task-irrelevant value representations. \n\n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants in this study were 34 healthy, right-handed volunteers with no history of neurological or psychiatric illnesses. As in our previous studies , participants\u2019 history of neurological or psychiatric illnesses was obtained through self-reports. Participants were recruited through flyers posted on a university campus and provided their written informed consent after receiving an explanation regarding the nature of the experiment. All procedures were conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The experimental protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Tohoku University School of Medicine. \n\nWe excluded seven participants. Four participants dropped out due to excessive head movements (more than 3\u2009mm) during MRI scanning. Three participants were also removed from the analyses because they purchased too few items to provide sufficient data for our model fitting (i.e., they paid 0 yen more than 90 percent of the time for either hedonic or utilitarian goods). Finally, data from 27 participants were used (mean age\u2009=\u200920.37,   SD  \u2009=\u20091.15, 6 females). \n\n\n### Stimulus \n  \nParticipants in this neuroimaging study evaluated the cover of books during MRI sessions. We classified books as either hedonic or utilitarian goods (either predominantly hedonic or utilitarian attitude scores). According to consumer literature, hedonic goods have predominantly hedonic attitude scores, and utilitarian goods have predominantly utilitarian attitude scores. Hedonic/utilitarian goods with predominantly hedonic/utilitarian attitude scores are bought for hedonic/utilitarian reasons, respectively . \n\nThe hedonic and utilitarian goods used in the MRI experiment were selected from 500 books through a preliminary Internet study. A total of 1,000 participants joined the preliminary Internet study and randomly evaluated each of the 50 books in the pool. Each book was evaluated based on questions, including hedonic and utilitarian scales for consumer attitudes , willingness-to-pay, knowledge content, and brightness of the cover by each of the 100 participants. The hedonic and utilitarian scales of consumer attitudes consist of five items each (hedonic: fun/not fun, exciting/dull, delightful/not delightful, thrilling/not thrilling, enjoyable/unenjoyable; utilitarian: effective/ineffective, helpful/unhelpful, functional/not functional, necessary/unnecessary, practical/impractical). All ratings were conducted on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). The book prices were in the same range (500\u20131000 yen corresponding to $4.5\u20139.0), but participants were told not to consider the price during evaluation. \n\nFinally, 152 books were selected (76 hedonic and 76 utilitarian) as goods in this study based on the hedonic and utilitarian scales of consumer attitudes . We define hedonic goods as having higher hedonic and lower utilitarian attitude scores than utilitarian goods, and   vice versa   for utilitarian goods based on the hedonic and utilitarian scales of consumer attitudes (hedonic attitude: 4.159\u2009\u00b1\u20090.130 for hedonic goods and 3.819\u2009\u00b1\u20090.133 for utilitarian goods; utilitarian attitude: 3.402\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1436 for hedonic goods and 4.518\u2009\u00b1\u20090.242 for utilitarian goods). The hedonic and utilitarian goods have the same distributions of perceptual levels, to match the total number of people and the lines of the title in the book ranging from 2 to 5 (3.778\u2009\u00b1\u20091.064 for both hedonic and utilitarian goods). \n\n\n### Task design \n  \nDuring the event-related fMRI sessions, participants performed either purchasing or perceptual decisions in alternating blocks (Fig.\u00a0 ). Each good was presented twice: once during the purchasing decision and once during the perceptual decision. Before each block started, both blocks were cued visually so participants knew in which block they were performing. Hedonic and utilitarian goods were presented in a random order. There were four blocks, and each block had 76 stimuli.   \nParticipants performed two types of task in relation to identical stimuli (book cover: hedonic/utilitarian). (  A  ) For purchasing decisions, participants indicated their willingness to pay a specific price for that book. (  B  ) For perceptual choices, participants indicated the total number of people and lines on the book cover. \n  \n\nTo capture explicit hedonic/utilitarian values, we asked participants how much they would be willing to pay for the goods during purchasing decisions (willingness-to-pay: WTP), as previously described . We considered the WTP scores as the economic value of goods, and the WTP scores for hedonic/utilitarian goods as hedonic/utilitarian values, respectively. We also assumed that participants automatically calculate WTP without the need for purchasing behavior during exposure to the goods and, therefore, WTP reflects the explicit and task-irrelevant economic values of the goods during purchasing decisions . \n\nWe followed the Becker\u2013Degroot\u2013Marshak (BDM) auction method, which is widely used in economics to incentivize participants to reveal their true values for goods without actually providing all the selected goods . In brief, participants were given money (450 yen in our case) for purchasing decisions and state their WTP for each item. They placed bids on the goods from a range of prices (0 yen, 150 yen, 300 yen or 450 yen in our case) as the stated WTP. At the end of the experiment, one trial was randomly selected, and then the experimenter generated a random selling price (from a known distribution of 0 yen, 150 yen, 300 yen, and 450 yen with equal probability in our case). If the random selling price was less than or equal to their stated WTP, the participant could purchase the goods at the random selling price and kept the remaining money. If the selling price was greater than their WTP, the participant could not purchase the item and keeps the entire 450 yen. Therefore, participants\u2019 optimal strategy was to state their true value for goods on every trial. \n\nParticipants also performed perceptual decisions for a perceptual task. They viewed the cover of the book, and answered questions relating to perceptual levels: the total number of people and lines of the title in the book (by 2, 3, 4, or 5). Each book included at least one person and one line of title. They saw the same books during both decisions, but the order was pseudo-randomized to eliminate the order effects. Therefore, this procedure allowed motor responses and sensory input to be matched in both purchasing and perceptual tasks. \n\nAfter MRI, participants viewed the same books and choose the reasoning for the purchase of each book from among four categories (hedonic: emotional wants, utilitarian: functional needs, both hedonic and utilitarian, and neither hedonic nor utilitarian). Participants also indicated their hedonic and utilitarian scores, their knowledge of content presented, and the brightness of the cover on a 7-point Likert scale. \n\nThe stimulus presentation and response recording during the experiments were controlled using Psychopy . \n\n\n### Measurements of reward sensitivity \n  \nWe used the Japanese version of the BIS/BAS scales to assess reward sensitivity . The Japanese version of the BIS/BAS scales consists of 20 items on a four-point Likert scale. BAS-Reward Responsiveness contains five items and both BAS-Drive and BAS-Fun Seeking consist of four items. The mean and SD were 16.33\u2009\u00b1\u20092.148 for BAS- Reward Responsiveness, 11.407\u2009\u00b1\u20092.227 for BAS- Fun Seeking, and 12.000\u2009\u00b1\u20091.881 for BAS-Drive. We did not observe any outliers (more than 3\u2009SD) among these three BAS subscales. \n\n\n### Behavioral analyses \n  \nTo investigate the effects of hedonic and utilitarian attitudes on the value of goods, we estimated a linear mixed regression model. The dependent variable was hedonic/utilitarian value (the amount of money paid for each good) in a given trial. The independent variables were hedonic and utilitarian attitude scores indicated by the same participant for the goods after MRI, which were entered as fixed effects, whereas participants were modeled as random effects. We converted the range of prices (0 yen, 150 yen, 300 yen or 450 yen) to a range from 1 to 4 for the analyses. \n\nTo test for the differences in other factors between hedonic/utilitarian goods, the individual mean economic values, perceptual levels, and reaction times (RTs) were also compared using a paired   t  -test. We converted the range of perceptual levels (2, 3, 4, or 5) to a range from 1 to 4 for the analyses. We also checked the differences of confounding factors influencing values in hedonic and utilitarian goods in the post-MRI questions (the knowledge content, and brightness of the cover) using a paired   t  -test. \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nFor all sessions, 41 transaxial gradient-echo images (echo time\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, slice thickness\u2009=\u20093\u2009mm, slice gap\u2009=\u20090.5\u2009mm, field of view [FOV]\u2009=\u2009192\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, voxel size\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm) covering the entire cerebrum were acquired at a repetition time of 2.5\u2009s using an echo planar sequence and an Achieva (3\u2009T) MR scanner (Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Slice orientation was acquired with a 30\u00b0 tilt from the anterior commissure\u2013posterior commissure to minimize signal loss in the orbitofrontal cortex . To improve registrations, high-resolution T1-weighted structural images were also acquired (matrix\u2009=\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240; repetition time\u2009=\u20096.5\u2009ms; echo time\u2009=\u20093\u2009ms; slice thickness\u2009=\u20091.0\u2009mm; FOV\u2009=\u200924\u2009cm; slices\u2009=\u2009162). \n\n\n### Image processing \n  \nThe following preprocessing procedures and subsequent statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) software (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK) and MATLAB\u00ae (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). These procedures included adjustment of acquisition timing across slices, correction for head motion, spatial normalization using the high-resolution T1-weighted structural imaging, and smoothing using a Gaussian kernel with a full width at half-maximum of 8\u2009mm. The normalization step yielded BOLD images at 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm voxels. \n\n\n### fMRI statistical analysis \n  \nTo estimate BOLD signals with explicit and task-irrelevant WTP for hedonic and utilitarian goods, we ran general linear models (GLMs) at the first (individual) level. We ran separate GLMs for purchasing and perceptual decisions. For purchasing choices, we included two regressors (1, WTP; 2, perceptual levels) in the GLM. For perceptual choices, we include two regressors (1, WTP; 2, perceptual levels) in the other GLM. WTP was obtained during purchasing choices and, therefore, it was explicit during purchasing choices and task-irrelevant during perceptual choices. Perceptual levels were obtained during perceptual choices and, therefore, were task-irrelevant during purchasing choices and explicit during perceptual choices. The onset of the BOLD signal for the analysis occurred at the time of presentation of the book cover. Trial duration in the GLMs was set to the RTs on that trial. Each of the regressors was convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. The six rigid-body translation and rotation parameters derived from spatial realignment were also included as no-interests of the regressors. Data are high-pass filtered with a cutoff of 128\u2009s. \n\nFor the second-level analysis, we constructed a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 full-factorial design with four different conditions: (1) explicit hedonic values (EHV), (2) explicit utilitarian values (EUV), (3) task-irrelevant hedonic values (IHV) and (4) task-irrelevant utilitarian values (IUV). The factorial design included the images of the parameter estimates from the WTP parametric modulations for each condition. This model allowed us to test brain areas correlated with (1) EHV, (2) EUV, (3) IHV, and (4) IUV. \n\nSecond-level random-effects group contrast maps were investigated on these single-subject contrasts. The main effect of neural value representations and the correlation with WTP in each condition (EHV, EUV, IHV and IUV) were assessed. \n\nWe investigated the regions with common value representations for hedonic and utilitarian goods at explicit (EHV\u2009\u2229\u2009EUV) (H1). We performed a conjunction analysis  based on a conjunction null hypothesis . We performed the conjunction analysis assuming common value representations for hedonic and utilitarian goods for the explicit value judgments. Neural value-type specific representations were also assessed with explicit value representations, which were dependent on hedonic (EHV-EUV) and utilitarian values (EUV-EHV). \n\nTo test for regions showing common value representations for hedonic and utilitarian goods for task-irrelevant (IHV\u2009\u2229\u2009IUV) value judgments (H2), we performed the same analysis. We performed the same conjunction analysis that we did for common value representations for explicit hedonic and utilitarian goods. Neural value-type specific representations were assessed with task-irrelevant value representations dependent on hedonic values (IHV-IUV) and utilitarian values (IUV-IHV) (H3). \n\nTo test for modulation of value representations by BAS responsiveness, we created an interaction term for the unique effects of hedonic goods (EHV-UHV)-(EUV-IUV) and for the unique effects of task-irrelevant hedonic value (IHV-IUV)-(EHV-EUV) from the factorial design. Then, we investigated how individual differences in BAS modulate value representations of the interactions for the unique effects of hedonic value (H4), and the unique effects of task-irrelevant hedonic value, using a voxel-wise regression analysis. In the regression analysis, BAS values were entered as explanatory variables, contrasting the unique effects of the task-irrelevant hedonic value (EHV-UHV)-(EUV-IUV) and the hedonic value (IHV-IUV)-(EHV-EUV). \n\nActivations were considered significant at   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 for the clusters that survived whole-brain or small volume correction (both FWE-corrected,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 ). For small volume correction,   a priori   areas were defined by 8\u2009mm radius spheres around the activation peaks in the meta-analysis of valuation at the decision stage : vmPFC (x\u2009=\u2009\u22122, y\u2009=\u200940, z\u2009=\u2009\u22128), left VS (x\u2009=\u2009\u22126, y\u2009=\u20098, z\u2009=\u2009\u22124), right VS (x\u2009=\u20096, y\u2009=\u200910, z\u2009=\u2009\u22128). The regions were constructed using the PickAtlas toolbox . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral data \n  \n#### Hedonic/utilitarian attitude scores for hedonic and utilitarian goods \n  \nTo check the validity of hedonic and utilitarian goods for the neuroimaging samples, we tested for differences in hedonic/utilitarian attitude scores for hedonic and utilitarian goods in the post-MRI questions. Hedonic attitude scores are higher for hedonic goods than utilitarian goods (mean: 4.526\u2009\u00b1\u20090.653 for hedonic goods, mean: 2.392\u2009\u00b1\u20090.727 for utilitarian goods, t(26)\u2009=\u200912.387, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and utilitarian attitude scores are higher for utilitarian goods than hedonic goods (mean: 4.588\u2009\u00b1\u20090.765 for utilitarian, mean: 3.268\u2009\u00b1\u20090.743 for hedonic, t(26)\u2009=\u200911.596, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The results show that participants regard hedonic and utilitarian goods with a predominantly hedonic or utilitarian attitude, respectively. \n\n\n#### Buying reasons for hedonic and utilitarian goods \n  \nNext, to confirm the different buying reasons for hedonic and utilitarian goods, we tested for differences in buying reasons using the post-MRI questions, following previous consumer literature . For these analyses, we compared the differences in hedonic and utilitarian goods across participants using the paired   t  -test. Participants purchased hedonic goods based on hedonic reasons (emotional wants) for almost all trials (mean: 94.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.19%.), and the proportion was higher for hedonic goods than for utilitarian goods (mean: 94.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.19% for hedonic goods, mean: 1.40\u2009\u00b1\u20092.28% for utilitarian goods, t(26)\u2009=\u200987.200, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Participants purchased utilitarian goods based on utilitarian reasons (functional needs) for almost all trials (mean: 90.9\u2009\u00b1\u20098.73%), and the proportion was higher for utilitarian goods than for hedonic goods (mean: 90.9\u2009\u00b1\u20098.73% for utilitarian goods, mean: 2.25\u2009\u00b1\u20092.33% for hedonic goods, t(26)\u2009=\u200953.600, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The results indicate that hedonic and utilitarian goods are bought for distinct buying reasons based on either hedonic or utilitarian reasons, respectively, and that two value constructs exist. \n\n\n#### Influences of hedonic and utilitarian attitudes on the value of goods \n  \nFor a complementary approach, we estimated a linear mixed regression model to investigate the relationship between hedonic and utilitarian values (the amount of money paid for hedonic/utilitarian goods) and that between hedonic and utilitarian attitude scores. Linear mixed regression models show that hedonic attitude scores (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.351, p\u2009=\u20090.015), but not utilitarian attitude scores (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.031, p\u2009=\u20090.105), are significant predictors of hedonic values. In contrast to our expectations, hedonic (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.217, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and utilitarian attitude scores (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.522, p\u2009<\u20090.001) are found to be significant predictors of utilitarian values. The results suggest that hedonic attitudes influence both value types. \n\n\n#### Mean economic values, perceptual levels and reaction times \n  \nWe tested for differences in processing demands between both types of goods. Perceptual levels of hedonic and utilitarian goods did not significantly differ (t(26)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.065, p\u2009=\u20090.949, paired t test). The individual mean SV (subjective value) and PV (perceptual value) of hedonic and utilitarian goods were not significantly correlated, indicating that perceptual demands are independent of WTP for both goods (r\u2009=\u20090.060, p\u2009=\u20090.762, for hedonic goods; r\u2009=\u20090.055, p\u2009=\u20090.761 for utilitarian goods). RTs for hedonic and utilitarian goods purchasing choices did not significantly differ (t(26)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.442, p\u2009=\u20090.662, paired   t  -test). Perceptual choice RTs for hedonic and utilitarian goods were also not significantly different (t(26)\u2009=\u2009\u22121.779, p\u2009=\u20090.087, paired   t  -test). However, significant differences were observed for RTs for purchasing and perceptual hedonic goods (  t  (26)\u2009=\u2009\u22123.594,   p  \u2009=\u20090.001, paired   t  -test) as well as RTs for purchasing and perceptual utilitarian goods] (  t  (26)\u2009=\u2009\u22123.240,   p  \u2009=\u20090.003, paired   t  -test). Several characteristics of hedonic and utilitarian goods did not differ, including knowledge content scores (  t  (26)\u2009=\u20091.775,   p  \u2009=\u20090.078, paired   t  -test) and brightness score for the book cover scores (  t  (26)\u2009=\u20091.377,   p  \u2009=\u20090.171, paired   t  -test). These results indicate that the goods (hedonic vs. utilitarian) did not have different processing demands, including PV or RTs, for purchasing and perceptual choices. In contrast, task types (purchasing vs. perceptual) had different processing demands. \n\nThese consumer attitude results suggest that participants purchased hedonic and utilitarian goods based on different reasons, and that we can regard each value (the amount of money paid for each good) as hedonic and utilitarian, respectively. The other behavioral results also indicate that both types of goods are based on identical motor responses and perceptual levels and, therefore, allow for an unbiased comparative analysis of how hedonic and utilitarian values are represented in the brain in both explicit and task-irrelevant manners. \n\n\n#### Neural value representations of hedonic and utilitarian goods for explicit judgment \n  \nTo test for regions showing common responses to explicit values for both hedonic and utilitarian goods (H1), we performed a conjunction analysis. The small-volume-based analysis revealed significant common neural activation in the bilateral VS regions (Fig.\u00a0 ). These results were consistent with the neural common currency hypothesis. The results are shown in Table\u00a0 .   \nBrain regions correlated with hedonic and utilitarian values during purchasing decisions. (  A  ) Voxels in pale pink correlated with hedonic values, (  B  ) voxels in blue correlated with utilitarian values, and (  C  ) the conjunction of hedonic and utilitarian values shown in yellow. Sagittal, coronal, and axial sections showing the peak activation of vmPFC (x\u2009=\u2009\u22126, y\u2009=\u200947, z\u2009=\u2009\u22128), right VS (x\u2009=\u20099, y\u2009=\u200914, z\u2009=\u2009\u22125), and left VS (x\u2009=\u2009\u22129, y\u2009=\u20098, z\u2009=\u20091), respectively. The peak activations derived from the conjunction analysis of hedonic and utilitarian values during purchasing decisions. The data are presented in figures at a threshold of p\u2009<\u20090.001, uncorrected for illustrative purposes only. Coordinates are reported in the stereotaxic space of the MNI.

The uncorrected statistical threshold was p\u2009<\u20090.001, which was corrected to p\u2009<\u20090.05 using cluster size. Coordinates are reported in the stereotaxic space of the MNI. \n\nAbbreviations: vmPFC (ventromedial prefrontal cortex); VS (ventral striatum); SVC (small volume correction); EUV (explicit utilitarian values); IHV (task-irrelevant hedonic values); EHV (explicit hedonic values); IUV (task-irrelevant utilitarian values); n.s. (non-significant); MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute). \n  \n\nWe then investigated the neural value representation for both explicit and hedonic values. The whole brain analysis revealed that EHV was positively correlated with the activation of broad vmPFC and VS regions as well as the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The small-volume-based analysis also showed significant neural activation of EHV and EUV in the vmPFC and VS regions. However, we did not find any significant differences in explicit values between hedonic and utilitarian goods. The results are shown in Table\u00a0 .   \nNeural value representations. \n  \nBrain areas showing positive correlation with the amount of money subjects were willing to pay during the purchasing task (explicit values) and perceptual tasks (task-irrelevant values). The uncorrected statistical threshold was p\u2009<\u20090.001, which was corrected to p\u2009<\u20090.05 using cluster size. Coordinates are reported in the stereotaxic space of the MNI. \n\nAbbreviations: vmPFC (ventromedial prefrontal cortex); VS (ventral striatum); SVC (small volume correction); EUV (explicit utilitarian values); IHV (task-irrelevant hedonic values); EHV (explicit hedonic values); IUV (task-irrelevant utilitarian values); MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute). \n  \n\n\n#### Neural value representations of hedonic and utilitarian goods with task-irrelevant judgments \n  \nTo test for regions showing common responses to task-irrelevant values for both hedonic and utilitarian goods (H2), we performed a conjunction analysis. However, we did not find any task-irrelevant economic values in common between hedonic and utilitarian values. Therefore, the results do not support H2. When testing for regions dependent on task-irrelevant hedonic (vs. utilitarian) values, the whole brain analysis found that the task-irrelevant hedonic (vs. utilitarian) values show more activity in the occipito-temporal regions including the lingual gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Small-volume-based analysis revealed that task-irrelevant hedonic (vs. utilitarian) values show more activity in the vmPFC. However, the value type (hedonic/utilitarian) by judgment mode (explicit/task-irrelevant) interaction was not significant, indicating that the significance of the mere contrast between task-irrelevant hedonic and utilitarian values may not be caused by the interactions. The results do not support H3. We did not find any significant differences for task-irrelevant economic values that are dependent on utilitarian values. The results are shown in Table\u00a0 .   \nNeural value-type specific representation. \n  \nBrain areas showing explicit value representations dependent on hedonic values (EHV-EUV) and utilitarian values (EUV-EHV), and task-irrelevant value representations dependent on hedonic values (IHV-IUV) and utilitarian values (IUV-IHV). The uncorrected threshold was uncorrected p\u2009<\u20090.0001, and was corrected to p\u2009<\u20090.05 using cluster size. Coordinates are reported in the stereotaxic space of the MNI. \n\nAbbreviations: vmPFC (ventromedial prefrontal cortex); VS (ventral striatum); SVC (small volume correction); EUV (explicit utilitarian values); IHV (task-irrelevant hedonic values); EHV (explicit hedonic values); IUV (task-irrelevant utilitarian values); n.s. (non-significant); MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute). \n  \n\nThen, we investigating neural value representation for each task-irrelevant hedonic and utilitarian value. The whole brain analysis found that IHV was associated with greater activity in the orbitfrontal cortex, and small-volume-based analysis revealed that IHV was associated with greater activities in vmPFC. However, the results for IUV (see Table\u00a0 ) were not significant. \n\n\n#### BAS modulating neural value representations of hedonic and utilitarian goods \n  \nWe did not find any relationships between BAS (total scores and subscales) and value representation dependent on task-irrelevant hedonic value (IHV-IUV)-(EHV-EUV) in the whole brain or in the SVC analyses. We also did not find any relationships between BAS (total scores and subscales) and value representation dependent on explicit hedonic value (EHV\u2009+\u2009IHV) \u2212 (EUV\u2009+\u2009IUV) in the whole brain or in the ROI analyses. \n\nFor an exploratory analysis, we investigated whether the vmPFC activity of IHV modulated BAS. We defined the ROI within the vmPFC that encompassed voxels above our significance threshold during the task-irrelevant value judgment of hedonic value. MarsBaR was used to extract the average parameter estimates within the ROI. However, the vmPFC activity was not related to BAS (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.035, p\u2009=\u20090.862). Therefore, the results did not support H4. \n\n\n\n\n## General Discussion \n  \nThe aim of this study was to understand the relationship between affect and task-irrelevant value judgments in the brain. Although hedonic and utilitarian goods are purchased based on different buying considerations, there was no direct evidence regarding whether (1) the value of hedonic goods was commonly processed in the value-related regions during purchasing decisions (H1) and/or during value-irrelevant judgments (H2). Additionally, we did not find support for the hypothesis that the task-irrelevant value of hedonic (vs. utilitarian) goods was amplified (H3), or for the hypothesis that the task-irrelevant value of hedonic (vs. utilitarian) goods was amplified specifically in reward-sensitive consumers (H4). Neural data can help address these questions and refine our understanding of how consumers represent the value of consumer goods. Although the results did not support H2-4, the findings support H1. Value of hedonic and utilitarian goods were represented in the ventral striatum during purchasing. Together, the findings provide theoretical insights into how consumers represent the value of goods bought by different reasons. \n\nValues of hedonic and utilitarian goods are similarly processed in the ventral striatum during purchasing. Although neuroscience research has shown that common brain regions are involved in a variety of types of valuation , it remains unclear from consumer research  whether hedonic and utilitarian goods are evaluated on a single dimension or multiple dimensions. The current findings support a unidimensional value model, and refine the consumer value model. \n\nThe mechanism underlying the unidimensionality of valuations of hedonic and utilitarian goods during purchasing may be positive affect; that is, the value of both types of goods may be represented as positive affect (VS). Behavioral data also support the idea that the values of both hedonic and utilitarian goods are derived from positive affect. Only hedonic attitudes (affective states) influence values for both hedonic and utilitarian goods. Although people explained that they bought utilitarian goods for utilitarian reasons, evaluations of utility may automatically result in various affective states in the brain, and subjective reports may not capture this transformation. Although our result accords with a uni-dimensional model, the underlying mechanisms differ from the conventional model. Traditionally, the uni-dimensional model has considered the underlying mechanisms of valuation cognitive rather than affective . Our findings underscore the relevance of positive affect to value-based consumer decision making across different types of products. \n\nWe did not find evidence of task-irrelevant hedonic (vs. utilitarian) values or of modulation of evaluations by individual differences in reward sensitivity. Although it seems possible that the perceptual task in this study may not be appropriate for capturing task-irrelevant value, we observed task-irrelevant hedonic value in the vmPFC. Moreover, the task demandingness (measured by RTs) of judgments of hedonic and utilitarian goods did not differ for either explicit or perceptual judgments. Thus, task appropriateness and task demandingness might not have contributed to the results. However, behavioral evidence showed that value of utilitarian products was derived from positive affect, which may prevent us from detecting task-irrelevant hedonic (vs. utilitarian) values in the brain. Further study should use a more sophisticated experimental design to separate the effects of the hedonic and utilitarian dimensions on value. \n\nThe study has limitations. First, all participants were university students, and the gender ratio was unbalanced (6 females out of 27 total participants). Further studies should test whether these results are consistent in a variety of populations with balanced gender ratios. Second, task types (purchasing vs. perceptual) had different processing demands, or RTs. This might explain why we did not find any relationships between (total or subscale) BAS scores and value representation as a function of task-irrelevant hedonic value (IHV-IUV)-(EHV-EUV). \n\nIn conclusion, this study revealed, using fMRI, how consumers value different types of products during explicit and task-irrelevant judgment. The results showed that the values of hedonic and utilitarian goods were both processed in the same brain regions (ventral striatum and ventromedial PFC) during purchasing. This finding supports and reinforces the neural common currency hypothesis, and provides theoretical insight into constructs of consumer value representation. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6821801, "text_md5": "8bd8ee6176ee87e4602bf6ff9b2f0824", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 56], "journal": [57, 64], "publication_year": [66, 70], "title": [81, 191], "keywords": [205, 228], "abstract": [241, 1570], "body": [1579, 44642]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 31666605, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-52159-9", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6821801", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6821801"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6821801\">6821801</a>", "list_title": "PMC6821801  Common neural value representations of hedonic and utilitarian products in the ventral striatum: An fMRI study"}

For them, decision-making concerning high (HE) and low energy (LE) snacks differs when it comes to the need for self-control. In line, our first study aim was to investigate which brain regions are activated during food choices during HE compared to LE energy snacks in weight-concerned women. Since it is particularly difficult to resist HE snacks when they are very tasty, our second aim was to investigate in which brain regions choice-related activation varies with the food's tastiness. Our third aim was to assess in which brain regions choice-related activation varies with individual differences in self-regulatory success. To this end, 20 weight-concerned women indicated for 100 HE or LE snacks whether they wanted to eat them or not, while their brains were scanned using fMRI. HE snacks were refused more often than equally-liked LE snacks. HE snack choice elicited stronger activation in reward-related brain regions [medial to middle orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), caudate]. Highly tasty HE snacks were more difficult to resist and, accordingly, activation in inhibitory areas (inferior frontal gyrus, lateral OFC) was negatively associated with tastiness. More successful self-controllers showed increased activation in the supplementary motor area during HE food choices. In sum, the results suggest that HE snacks constitute a higher reward for weight-concerned women compared to (equally-liked) LE snacks, and that activation during food choice in brain regions involved in response inhibition varied with tastiness and individual differences in self-regulatory success. These findings advance our understanding of the neural correlates of food choice and point to new avenues for investigating explanations for self-regulatory failure. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nApproximately 50% of the Western female population reports to be concerned with their weight, to be a regular dieter, or to attempt to limit food intake (Rideout and Barr,  ; Fayet et al.,  ; de Ridder et al.,  ). However, in contrast to what their alleged weight concerns suggest, empirical evidence shows that self-reported weight-concerned women do not eat less than their non-weight-concerned counterparts and some studies even suggest that they are at increased risk for weight gain (French et al.,  ; Stice et al.,  ,  ,  ; Mann et al.,  ; de Witt Huberts et al.,  ). \n\nFor weight-concerned individuals, food choices constitute a classic self-control dilemma involving the trade-off between immediate eating enjoyment and the long term goal of being slim and healthy (Fishbach et al.,  ). Eating low-energy (LE) snacks is congruent with that goal. Since eating high-energy (HE) snacks is not, these individuals should exercise self-control to resist the HE snack in order to adhere to their long term goal. The need for self-control is particularly strong when HE snacks are very tasty. From the latter it follows that for weight-concerned women decision-making concerning HE and LE snacks differs when it comes to the need for self-control. Food-related decisions are made in the brain. For health promotion purposes it is therefore vital to increase understanding of the neural correlates of food choice in weight-concerned women. Insight into differential neural responses during food choices concerning HE and LE foods might explain why it is so difficult for weight-concerned women to adhere to their long-term goal. \n\nTo date, the neural responses during food choice in weight-concerned women have received relatively little attention. In contrast, the brain responses during viewing (HE and LE) foods and during food choice have been studied extensively in the general population and in selected non-weight-concerned populations (e.g., St-Onge et al.,  ; Uher et al.,  ; Frank et al.,  ; Hare et al.,  ; van der Laan et al.,  ,  ; Smeets et al.,  ). However, studies in non-weight-concerned individuals do not provide insights into self-control because for them energy content does not play a prominent role in food choice (Arvola et al.,  ; Ayres et al.,  ). A HE snack will only trigger the need for self-control if someone actually has the long-term goal to restrict intake (Fishbach et al.,  ). \n\nOnly a few studies have assessed the neural responses to foods in weight-concerned individuals (Coletta et al.,  ; Hare et al.,  ; Born et al.,  ; Burger and Stice,  ; Demos et al.,  ; Wagner et al.,  ; van der Laan et al.,  ). Most of these studies assessed the neural responses during passive viewing rather than during food choice: these studies showed that weight-concerned individuals have stronger activation in areas involved in food reward [e.g., striatum, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)] and response inhibition (inferior frontal gyrus) when viewing food (compared to nonfood) (Coletta et al.,  ; Demos et al.,  ; Wagner et al.,  ), although null-findings have also appeared (Burger and Stice,  ). To our knowledge, none of these studies assessed the contrast of viewing HE vs. LE foods. Thus, it is unknown in how far weight-concerned women respond differently to HE and LE foods. Two earlier studies have investigated the neural correlates of food choice in weight-concerned women (Hare et al.,  ; van der Laan et al.,  ). Hare et al. ( ) found that both the healthiness (strongly related to energy content) and tastiness ratings of foods correlated with activation in the vmPFC during food choice and they suggest that for a self-control attempt to be successful there should be dlPFC activation at the moment of choice to incorporate healthiness considerations. We previously found that weight-concerned women are generally unsuccessful in choosing LE over HE snacks and that this might be explained by a lack of anterior cingulate activation in response to the self-control dilemma (van der Laan et al.,  ). \n\nIn these two earlier studies on food-related self-control in weight-concerned women, the choices were always between two foods (Hare et al.,  ; van der Laan et al.,  ). The evaluation of alternatives in binary or multiple choices differs from single choices in several aspects. Firstly, in multiple choices the calculated value of alternatives is always relative to the other options while in single food choices the alternative is evaluated on its own (De Martino et al.,  ; van der Laan et al.,  ). Secondly, the presence of other (e.g., healthy) alternatives can influence the perception of the self-control dilemma: vicarious goal fulfillment theory posits that the mere presence of a healthy option can fulfill health-related goals (Wilcox et al.,  ), irrespective of whether the healthy option is actually chosen or not, and thereby increase the chance of indulging in HE snacks (Chandon and Wansink,  ; Fishbach and Zhang,  ; Wilcox et al.,  ). To our knowledge, no earlier study investigated the neural correlates of food-related self-control in weight-concerned women in a single-choice paradigm, i.e., in the absence of other alternatives that might influence choices and accompanying neural responses. \n\nTherefore, the present study assessed the neural correlates of single food choices in weight-concerned women. As outlined above, for these women decision-making differs between HE and LE snacks when it comes to the need for self-control. Accordingly, the first aim of this study was to investigate which brain regions involved in self-control are activated during decision-making concerning single HE compared to LE snacks, in weight-concerned women. Because refusing HE snacks is increasingly difficult with increasing tastiness, we expected that activation during HE (but not LE) snack choice in brain regions involved in conflict and self-control would vary with the snacks' tastiness. Therefore, our second aim was to establish how tastiness varies with brain activation during food choice for HE and LE snacks. \n\nWeight-concerned women are a heterogeneous group varying greatly in self-regulatory success (Jansen et al.,  ; Keller and Siegrist,  ). Earlier studies have shown that successful restraint eaters and successful dieters differ from unsuccessful counterparts in several aspects: they are better at inhibitory control tasks, they score higher on dispositional self-control and they have stronger automatic activation of long term goal activation when confronted with temptation (Papies et al.,  ; Kroese et al.,  ; Hofmann et al.,  ; Keller and Siegrist,  ). Therefore, our third aim was to investigate in which brain regions activation during food choice covaries with individual differences in self-regulatory success (indicated by the amount of refused HE snacks). \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Ethics statement \n  \nThe study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht (file 10-461) and subjects provided written informed consent. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nThe study comprised of 20 women as participants (age in years:   M   = 21.2,   SD   = 2.8; BMI in kg/m :   M   = 21.3,   SD   = 1.7). Participants filled in a questionnaire on in-/exclusion criteria upon screening. As self-control conflict is only relevant for individuals who are weight-concerned, inclusion criteria consisted of a restraint-score above average or high [Dutch Eating behavior questionnaire reference table for female students; Van Strien et al.,  , (  M   = 3.1,   SD   = 0.4)] and a rating of 6 or higher on each of two questions: \u201cTo what extent are you weight-concerned?\u201d (  M   = 6.6,   SD   = 0.8) and \u201cTo what extent are you occupied with being slim?\u201d (  M   = 7.0,   SD   = 0.8; ranging from 1 = not at all to 9 = very much; adapted from Fishbach et al.,  ). Participant selection was limited to women because they generally score higher on weight concern and because of known gender differences in reasons for dieting as well as in brain anatomy and function (Pingitore et al.,  ; Neumark-Sztainer et al.,  ; Cahill,  ; Luders et al.,  ). In addition, there are gender differences in the brain response to food cues (Smeets et al.,  ; Cornier et al.,  ; Frank et al.,  ; Haase et al.,  ). Additional inclusion criteria were having an age between 18 and 30 years, being right-handed and having a normal weight (BMI between 18.5 and 25 kg/m ). We included women with a healthy weight because research showed that normal-weight individuals who report high weight-concerns might be at increased risk for gaining weight (French et al.,  ; Mann et al.,  ). Exclusion criteria consisted of having a food allergy, having an eating disorder [\u201cDo you have an eating disorder (for example, anorexia or bulimia nervosa)? Yes/No\u201d], and having a history of medical or surgical events that might significantly affect the study outcome, such as metabolic or endocrine disease, or any gastro-intestinal disorder. Smokers and individuals having a current alcohol consumption of >28 units per week were excluded because these factors have been shown to affect the neural response to rewarding stimuli: heavy drinkers have reduced responses to food cues (Ihssen et al.,  ). Twenty eight units used to be the cut-off for \u201csensible\u201d alcohol use, as defined by the British Royal College of Physicians. We excluded women that followed a medically prescribed diet in the past 6 months or that had weight fluctuations of more than 5 kg in the past 6 months so as to exclude participants who may show biases in their food choices for medical reasons. Participants were recruited with posters at the University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands and the adjacent university campus. \n\n\n### Study procedures \n  \nThe study consisted of two sessions. During the first session, participants evaluated the expected tastiness and perceived energy of all food stimuli (presented on pictures) on 9-point scales ranging from 1 = very untasty / very few calories to 9 = very tasty / very many calories. To make sure participants were craving for a snack, they were instructed to refrain from eating and drinking (except water) for at least 2 h prior to both sessions but to have preferably eaten a meal within 2\u20133 h before the session (second session: mean time since last food intake in minutes \u00b1   SD  : 140 \u00b1 22). Moreover, to avoid effects of time of day, we planned the first and second session at approximately the same time of day. Upon arrival at the second session, participants received instructions and rated hunger on a VAS scale ranging from 0 (not hungry) to 100 (very hungry) (mean hunger \u00b1   SD  : 59 \u00b1 12). To ensure the relevance of their weight-concerns, participants filled out a questionnaire about an allegedly new type of biscuit (giving ratings of expected tastiness, expected energy content, and to what extent eating the biscuit is appropriate for individuals who are watching their weight). Next, participants were scanned using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while performing a food choice task. After the food choice task reported here, they performed another unrelated food choice task. At the end of the second session, participants received a snack of their choice, were thanked, and reimbursed. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nThe visual stimuli consisted of 100 pictures of regularly available snack foods on plates with a gray background: 50 HE foods (energy content in kcal/100 gram:   M   = 419,   SD   = 103) and 50 LE foods (  M   = 56,   SD   = 37). The mean perceived energy content (rated in the first session on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 = very few calories to 9 = very many calories) of the HE stimuli was 7.5 (  SD   = 1.4) and of the LE stimuli was 3.6 (  SD   = 1.7). Examples of HE snacks were crisps, cookies, cakes and candies. Examples of LE snacks were grapes, apples, bananas and mixed snack salads. \n\n\n### fMRI single food choice task \n  \nDuring the functional MRI scan, participants performed a food choice task (Figure  ). In this ask, participants made 100 choices. In every trial, they viewed one of the study stimuli (3000 ms, choice period) and subsequently had to indicate with a button press (1500 ms, button press period) whether they wanted to eat a portion of the snack or not. During the button press period the words \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d were shown left/right (randomized) on the screen. After indicating their choice, a yellow box appeared around the yes or no. Participants were instructed to make their choice already during the period that the image was shown. To ensure that their choices were actually made in direct response to the food pictures, the button press period was so short that it only allowed them to locate whether they had to push the left or right button. The choice trials were interspersed with a random interval (2000 and 5000 ms). At the beginning, halfway (after 50 trials) and at the end an additional baseline period of 30,000 ms was included in the task. \n  \n Single food choice task trial structure  . \n  \nIn order to make the choices realistic, participants were instructed that one of the trials counted for real and that they would receive a portion of the snack chosen in that trial at the end of the study session. Eating a HE snack after a short period of fasting is not congruent with the participants' goal to watch their weight. Therefore, self-regulatory success was defined as the percentage of rejected HE snacks. \n\n\n### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nIn the food choice task trials were nested within participants. Therefore, a series of two-level logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate how tastiness and stimulus category (HE or LE) related to choice (chosen or not chosen). The statistical program R (packages lme4 and languageR) was used to perform multi-level regression analyses. \n\n\n### fMRI data \n  \n#### Image acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nMRI scanning was performed on a 3 Tesla scanner (Philips Achieva, Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands), equipped with an 8-channel SENSE head coil. A T -weighted structural image was acquired at a resolution of 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm (  TR   = 8.4 ms,   TE   = 3.8 ms, total scan duration = 284 s). Functional scans were acquired with a 2D-EPI sequence (TR/TE = 1400/23 ms, flip angle = 70\u00b0, nr slices = 30, voxel size = 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 mm). The total number of volumes (540\u2013580) acquired differed between participants because of the random inter-trial interval. \n\nData were preprocessed and analyzed using the SPM8 software package (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, United Kingdom) ran with MATLAB R2012A (The Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA). Functional images were realigned to the first image of the time series. Functional and structural images were co-registered and normalized (retaining 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 mm voxels) to MNI space (Evans et al.,  ) by using linear and nonlinear transformations. The data were smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full width at half maximum. \n\n\n#### Participant level analyses \n  \nStatistical maps were generated for each participant by fitting a boxcar function to the time series, convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Data were high-pass filtered with a cutoff of 128 s. \n\nTwo models were fitted. Four conditions were modeled in the first model: the HE choice periods, the LE choice periods, the button press screen, and the practice trial and missed trials. To establish brain regions that respond differently to HE and LE choice periods, we performed a mean subtraction analysis between HE and LE choice periods, resulting in a contrast image of HE minus LE choice periods and a contrast image of LE minus HE choice periods. Furthermore, a contrast image of HE choice periods vs. baseline and a contrast image of LE choice periods vs. baseline were calculated. \n\nThe second model was constructed to identify brain regions in which activation correlates with tastiness. The same four conditions as in the first model were modeled. A parametric regressor with the self-reported tastiness ratings of the respective snacks was added to the HE and LE choice periods. To identify in which brain regions activation correlates with tastiness, the following two contrast images were calculated: to establish the brain regions that were related with tastiness ratings during HE choice periods we conducted a parametric modulation analysis with the tastiness ratings during HE choice periods; to establish the brain regions that were related with tastiness ratings during LE choice periods we conducted a parametric modulation analysis with the tastiness ratings during LE choice periods. \n\n\n#### Group level analyses \n  \nTo determine which brain regions showed differential activation for HE and LE choice periods, the contrast images of HE minus LE choice periods (and vice versa) were entered into one-sample   t  -test analyses. To determine brain regions in which activation was positively or negatively related with self-reported tastiness ratings during HE and LE choice periods, the respective contrast images were entered into one-sample   t  -tests. To establish in which brain regions individual differences in self-regulatory success (i.e., the proportion of accepted or refused HE snacks) were related with the neural activation during the choice, the contrast images of HE choice periods vs. baseline were entered into two one-sample   t  -tests with as covariate the proportion of accepted and refused HE snacks, respectively. Also, the contrast images of LE choice periods versus baseline were entered into two one-sample   t  -tests with as covariate the proportion of accepted and refused LE snacks, respectively. \n\nTo be as objective as possible in our selection of Regions of interest (ROIs), we took them from a meta-analysis on the neural response to food cues that included more than 20 studies (van der Laan et al.,  ): posterior fusiform gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus\u2014orbital part, insular cortex, superior parietal gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, amygdala, calcarine sulcus, lingual gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, (hypo)thalamus, ventral striatum, culmen, middle frontal gyrus, and inferior temporal gyrus. ROI masks were generated using the AAL-atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al.,  ) as implemented in the WFU-pickatlas toolbox (Maldjian et al.,  ). For ROIs a statistical threshold of   p   < 0.05 Family Wise Error (FWE) corrected over the ROI volume (i.e., small volume correction) was used. For completeness, we employed no additional extent threshold for ROIs. For additional statistical rigor, a Bonferroni correction should be done for the number of ROIs (15), resulting in a statistical threshold of   p   < 0.003 FWE-corrected over the ROI volume. However, considering the criticism of Bonferroni being too conservative with large numbers of tests and similar expected effects across tests (non-independence) (see e.g., Perneger,  ), we also report results that did not survive this additional Bonferroni correction. For regions other than those of a-priori interest, we report clusters significant at a stricter statistical threshold of p < 0.001 uncorrected and a cluster extent   k   > 12, in line with other studies in the field (e.g., Martin et al.,  ; Demos et al.,  ; Seo et al.,  ; Stice et al.,  ; Van den Bosch et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nA two-level logistic regression model (Table  ) with as outcome choice (1 = accept, 0 = refuse) and as predictors energy content (LE or HE), and self-reported tastiness of the stimulus, revealed that LE snacks were accepted significantly more often (mean % \u00b1   SD  : 62 \u00b1 17) than HE (48 \u00b1 24), and the more tasty a snack was (regardless of energy content) the higher the likelihood that it would be accepted. Figure   shows the proportion of accepted snacks per tastiness rating, for HE and LE snacks. \n  \n Multi-level logistic regression results: energy content and self-reported tastiness predict choice  . \n    \n Proportion of accepted snacks by tastiness rating, for HE and LE snacks  . \n  \nTastiness, rated on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 = very untasty to 9 = very tasty, did not differ significantly between LE (mean \u00b1   SD  : 7.0 \u00b1 0.7) and HE (6.7 \u00b1 0.9) food categories (  p   = 0.19). \n\n\n### fMRI results \n  \n#### HE vs. LE choice periods \n  \nSeveral brain regions, including the orbital part of the right superior frontal gyrus (medial to middle OFC), the left lingual gyrus, the left parahippocampal gyrus, the left calcarine sulcus, and the left caudate (marginally significant), were activated stronger in response to HE compared to LE food choices (Table  , Figures  ). Clusters in the right superior parietal gyrus were activated more strongly during LE compared to HE choice periods (Table  , Figure  ). \n  \n Brain regions differentially activated in response to HE and LE choice periods  . \n      \n Brain regions activated during HE vs. LE food choice periods. (A\u2013C)   Regions stronger activated during HE food choices: clusters in   (A)   calcarine sulcus and orbital part of superior frontal gyrus,   (B)   caudate and   (C)   parahippocampal gyrus.   (D)   Brain region stronger activated during LE food choice periods: cluster in superior parietal gyrus. \n  \n\n#### Parametric modulation by tastiness \n  \nThere were no brain regions in which activation was positively modulated by tastiness during HE choice periods. Activation in the orbital part (lateral OFC) and a more superior part of the middle frontal gyrus, the opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus, and the precuneus was negatively modulated by tastiness in HE choice periods (Table  ). There were no brain regions in which activation during LE choice periods was positively or negatively modulated by tastiness. \n  \n Brain regions of which activation during HE food choice periods was negatively related to tastiness (parametric modulation)  . \n    \n\n#### Brain regions in which activation covaries with self-regulatory success \n  \nThere were no brain regions in which activation during HE choice periods covaried positively with the proportion of accepted HE snacks. Activation in the angular gyrus, the supplementary motor area (SMA), the middle occipital gyrus, and the cerebellum during the HE choice periods covaried significantly (positive) with the proportion of rejected HE snacks (Table  , Figure  ). Thus, participants who rejected more HE snacks had significantly stronger activation in these areas during HE choice periods. \n  \n Brain regions of which activation during HE food choice periods covaries positively with the proportion of rejected HE snacks  . \n      \n Activation in the right SMA during the HE choice periods covaries with self-regulatory success. (A)   Plot showing correlation between parameter estimate HE vs. baseline in right SMA cluster and the proportion of rejected HE snacks.   (B)   Brain regions in which activation covaries with proportion of rejected HE snacks. Circle indicates right SMA cluster. For visualization purposes, fMRI-results are thresholded at   T   > 2.87. \n  \nTo rule out the alternative explanation that participants who rejected more HE snacks had a lower preference for HE snacks and that activation in the identified regions reflected this, we repeated the analysis while controlling for individual differences in preference for HE snacks. To this end, the participants' mean tastiness rating of HE snacks was added as first and the proportion of rejected HE snacks as second covariate. The clusters in the SMA [  Z   = 3.94, MNI (14, \u221220, 54)] and cerebellum [  Z   = 4.03, MNI (\u221230, \u221280, \u221234)] still significantly covaried with the proportion of rejected HE snacks, indicating that activation in these regions was not due to a lower general preference for HE snacks, but rather due to self-regulatory success. \n\nThere were no brain regions of which activation during LE choice periods significantly covaried with the proportion of accepted or rejected LE snacks. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur study aims were to investigate in weight-concerned women which brain regions are activated during HE and LE food choices, and to assess in which brain regions activation varied with tastiness and individual differences in self-regulatory success. On average, participants were at best moderately successful in choosing in line with their long-term goal since they accepted almost 50% of the HE snacks. The behavioral results revealed that both tastiness and energy content (independently) influenced the likelihood that a snack was accepted or refused. The finding that weight-concerned women refused more HE than LE snacks, or equivalently, accepted more LE than HE snacks which were equal in tastiness, underlines that decision-making for HE and LE snacks constitutes more than only tastiness considerations. While the number of accepted HE snacks is indicative of the extent to which someone adheres to her weight-watching goal, the number of accepted LE is not: eating an LE snack does not contribute to limiting energy intake when this snack does not replace a HE snack that would otherwise be eaten. \n\nThe finding that HE snacks were refused more often than equally liked LE snacks might suggest that the participants employed self-control to resist the HE snacks. In line with self-regulation theory, exposure to HE snacks might have supported the need to employ self-control to inhibit the initial tendency to accept them (Fishbach et al.,  ). Another explanation for why more LE than HE snacks were accepted could be that participants perceived LE snacks as healthy and therefore eating them conduces health. Other studies have shown that people eat more of foods which are assumed to be healthy (Wansink and Chandon,  ; Provencher et al.,  ) and another study even showed that people erroneously believe that eating healthy foods in addition to unhealthy ones can decrease total calorie count (Chernev,  ). \n\nIt is important to note that the HE and LE snacks did not differ significantly in average tastiness in our study. This is a vital advantage of our study compared to many earlier studies in which brain responses to energy content and tastiness were confounded due to the higher tastiness of the HE foods (van der Laan et al.,  ) Yet, although equally tasty, we found that HE food choices still elicited stronger activation in a cluster in the medial/middle OFC that has consistently been shown to activate during processing and evaluating rewarding stimuli (Elliott et al.,  ; Kringelbach,  ; Hampshire et al.,  ). Furthermore, a cluster in the caudate tended (borderline significant) to activate stronger during HE food choice. This region plays a prominent role in reward processing as it responds to both valence and saliency of rewards (Carlezon and Thomas,  ; Litt et al.,  ). Finally, a cluster in the parahippocampal gyrus activated more strongly during HE (vs. LE) food choice. Parahippocampal gyrus activation has been shown to predict subsequent consumer choice and is thought to reflect the expected reward value of a stimulus (Tusche et al.,  ). This region has also been shown to activate during choices in which an immediate (and not when a delayed) reward was available (McClure et al.,  ). Since participants were slightly hungry due to the 2 h fast before the scan, it could be that HE snacks had a higher momentary biological reward value due to the energy content, which translates into activation in the OFC, the caudate and the parahippocampal gyrus. This is also in line with the finding that hunger modulates the neural activation to visual food cues in the parahippocampal gyrus (van der Laan et al.,  ). To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the differential neural response during food choices concerning HE and LE snacks in weight-concerned women. Altogether, our findings suggest that for weight-concerned women, HE snacks might have a higher reward than LE snacks, even when they are equally tasty. \n\nSince it is particularly difficult to resist a HE snack when it is very tasty, it was expected that choice-related activation in brain regions involved in conflict and self-control would vary with tastiness. Therefore, our second aim was to investigate in which brain regions activation was parametrically modulated by tastiness. In line with the behavioral finding that highly tasty HE snacks were indeed resisted less often, we found that activation in the opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus and the orbital part of the middle frontal gyrus (lateral OFC) varied negatively with tastiness during HE choice. That is, activation in these areas was lower for tastier HE snacks. The opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus has previously been shown to activate during response inhibition (Aron et al.,  ). Studies have shown that the lateral OFC (in contrast to the medial OFC which activates in response to rewards) is involved in response inhibition (Elliott et al.,  ; Kringelbach,  ). Thus, lower activation in these regions might be explained by their failure to inhibit desire for highly tasty HE snacks. An explanation for why we only identified this cluster for the HE and not for LE snacks might be that LE snacks do not pose a threat to the long-term weight watching goal, and therefore do not elicit inhibitory responses (neither when high, nor when low in tastiness). \n\nOur third aim was to investigate whether the neural response during food choices covaried with self-regulatory success as indicated by the number of refused HE snacks. We found that participants who rejected more HE snacks showed stronger activation during HE food choices in several brain regions, including the SMA. The SMA receives inputs from the striatum, through the pre-SMA, and projects to the primary motor cortex, leading to action (Haggard,  ,  ). Although the (pre-)SMA has repeatedly been shown to activate during inhibitory processes relating to food and monetary stimuli (Hendrick et al.,  ; Hollmann et al.,  ; Ma et al.,  ; Pawliczek et al.,  ), the exact function of the SMA in response inhibition is relatively poor understood. Classically, it was thought that the SMA merely serves as an intermediate between higher cognitive areas and the motor cortex, which would imply that SMA activation is just reflective of decisions made elsewhere (e.g., in the OFC, Nachev,  ). Accordingly, it could be argued that SMA functioning is crucial for self-control since functioning in this brain region determines whether the choices made in higher cognitive areas can actually be executed. On the other hand, the pre-SMA and SMA are increasingly being implicated in immediate executive control (Oliveri et al.,  ; Nachev,  ; Hollmann et al.,  ). In line with this notion, it has been found that stimulating the SMA with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) appeared to influence excitability of the motor cortex differently during exposure to emotionally unpleasant compared to neutral visual cues (Oliveri et al.,  ). This would suggest that the SMA is not merely an intermediate, but that rather that transmission from the SMA to the motor cortex depends on the emotional valence of the cue that triggers the behavior. In our study, the stronger SMA activation during food choice in participants that refused more HE snacks, may reflect inhibition of their initial tendency to accept HE snacks (as indicated by the stronger reward-related striatal and OFC response to HE compared to LE snacks in this study). Future research using techniques (like TMS) that (temporarily) disrupt the function of the SMA and higher cognitive areas should elucidate the causal role of the SMA in food-related self-control. \n\nFrom theory it follows that having a long-term goal is a prerequisite for perceiving an internal conflict in response to a self-control dilemma (e.g., Fishbach et al.,  ). For this reason, we included participants which were weight-concerned according to self-reports. We cannot claim, however, that results are specific for this group. Therefore, it is of high interest to repeat this paradigm in a non-weight-concerned population. By comparing our results with a group of non-weight-concerned women, we could rule out whether the effects seen in the present study are general effects that occur also in non-weight-concerned women or whether they are specific for weight-concerned women in which the self-control dilemma is relevant. Our study population consisted of women with a normal weight and therefore their motivation for weight-concern might not arise from medical or health reasons. Rather, since earlier studies showed a clear link between worries about appearance and weight-concerns/restraint (Putterman and Linden,  ,  ; O'Brien et al.,  ; de Ridder et al.,  ) we think that the high level of self-reported weight-concerns in our study population might indicate an intention to lose weight for cosmetic reasons or general concerns about healthy eating. Although our population was of normal weight, research has shown that normal-weight individuals who report high weight-concerns might be at increased risk for gaining weight (French et al.,  ; Mann et al.,  ). Therefore, normal weight females reporting high levels of weight-concerns are a very important population to focus on in research and weight-maintenance interventions. \n\nA limitation of our study is that we did not control for possible effects of menstrual cycle phase. This may have introduced some variation in brain responses. However, since 16 of the 20 participants used hormonal contraceptives, which reduce hormonal fluctuations, we do not think that this has significantly biased our findings. \n\nTo conclude, our findings indicate that HE snacks constitute a higher reward than LE snacks, for weight-concerned women, even when they are equally tasty. This might explain why it is so hard to resist HE snacks. The negative association between brain activation in inhibitory areas and tastiness suggests that inhibition fails when HE snacks are very tasty. Finally, women who better adhere to their long term weight-watching goal show increased SMA activation during food choices concerning HE snacks, which emphasizes the need for future research assessing whether SMA functioning plays a role in the control of food intake. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nLaura Nynke van der Laan, Paul A.

The cortical mapping of attentional systems identified two segregated networks that mediate stimulus-driven and goal-driven processes, the Ventral and the Dorsal Attention Networks (VAN, DAN). Deep brain electrophysiological recordings, behavioral data from phylogenetic distant species, and observations from human brain pathologies challenge purely corticocentric models. Here, we used advanced methods of functional alignment applied to resting-state functional connectivity analyses to map the subcortical architecture of the Ventral and Dorsal Attention Networks. Our investigations revealed the involvement of the pulvinar, the superior colliculi, the head of caudate nuclei, and a cluster of brainstem nuclei relevant to both networks. These nuclei are densely connected structural network hubs, as revealed by diffusion-weighted imaging tractography. Their projections establish interrelations with the acetylcholine nicotinic receptor as well as dopamine and serotonin transporters, as demonstrated in a spatial correlation analysis with a normative atlas of neurotransmitter systems. This convergence of functional, structural, and neurochemical evidence provides a comprehensive framework to understand the neural basis of attention across different species and brain diseases. \n  \nIntegration of functional, structural, and neurochemical data proposes a framework to comprehensively understand the neural basis of attention across different species and neurological diseases. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \n\u201cEveryone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought.\u201d . \n\nEverything we see, feel, or smell is an illusion elaborated by our brain circuits. However, the brain\u2019s capacity is limited. This requires mechanisms for the selection of the most relevant information. The ensemble of cognitive and neural processes involved in capacity limitation and selection underlies \u2018attention\u2019 as defined by James . Behavioral studies have distinguished orienting of attention into a slow, strategic, goal-directed, and voluntary component versus a swift, unexpected, bottom-up, and automatic component . Task-related functional neuroimaging (  f  MRI) studies segregated these two attentional processes anatomically into a dorsal and ventral attentional network . The dorsal attention network (DAN) encodes and maintains preparatory signals and modulates top-down sensory (visual, auditory,\u00a0olfactory and somatosensory) regions. \n\nIn contrast, the ventral attention network (VAN) is recruited when attention is re-oriented to novel behaviorally relevant events. Classical core regions of the DAN are the intraparietal sulcus, the superior parietal lobe, and the frontal eye fields. The DAN is considered to have no hemispheric lateralization . In contrast, the temporoparietal junction and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex constitute the central regions of the VAN. Evidence demonstrates that the VAN is right-lateralized . Within their respective networks, DAN and VAN regions have synchronous   f  MRI signal oscillations at rest . Thanks to this synchronization, the two networks have consistently been identified and segregated in resting-state   f  MRI cortical parcellations , although their taxonomy has not always been homogenous in the literature . Hence, the DAN and VAN are organized as independent networks even in the absence of task signals. However, their synchronization can change according to task demands, and they can be acting jointly or separately . Furthermore, DAN and VAN task activations and synchronization levels are modified by focal lesions and correlate with behavioral deficits . \n\nYet, electrical recording, pathological observations, and phylogenetic comparisons demonstrate that the neuroanatomical framework of attentional mechanisms should extend well beyond a corticocentric model. Electrical recordings in primates showed that subcortical structures have a crucial role in the neural mechanisms of attention. For instance, inactivation of the superior colliculus during motion-change detection markedly disturbs visual attention without affecting the neuronal activity in the visual cortex . Attentional states also modulate the thalamic pulvinar nuclei  and neuronal discharge patterns in the locus coeruleus . Pathophysiological data from human brain disease supports the critical relevance of deep brain nuclei. Neglect is a clinical syndrome characterized by pathological hemispatial inattention  and can arise from subcortical lesions in the pulvinar, striatum, or superior colliculus . Patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder also present alterations beyond the cortex , such as in the pulvinar, which is influenced by the severity of the disease and the use of stimulants . \n\nAdditionally, distant phylogenetic species, such as pigeons, have markedly different cortical morphologies but exhibit attention errors and reaction times similar to humans . With close mammals, such as macaques, relevant functional attention dissimilarities have been described at the cortical level, including the complete absence of a VAN . Hence, a core phylogenetically relevant subcortical network of areas appears to support the orientation of attention that has been mostly disregarded in the functional neuroimaging literature because of limited field strength or issues arising from average group alignments. Average group alignments of functional neuroimaging maps exclusively based on structural landmarks might typically fail to represent an accurate functional network due to interindividual differences . Specifically, subcortical nuclei are prone to structural misalignment due to their small size, poor contrast in structural MRI, and intersubject cytoarchitectonic variability . In contrast, advanced methods of functional alignment improve structural-functional correspondence across participants . Further, surface interindividual alignment based on morphological features, such as cortical folding, fairly aligns unimodal cortical areas, such as the primary visual and motor cortices, but poorly overlaps higher-order cortical areas . Methods of functional alignment based on   f  MRI signals during cognitive activation paradigms  and resting-state   f  MRI connectivity patterns  provided better function matching and have also been used for cross-species functional comparisons . Functional alignment is different from hyperalignment techniques that project shared neural information beyond the three-dimensional anatomical space, i.e., in high-dimensional spaces . At the subcortical level, our team also demonstrated that functional alignment methods can optimize the group-level mapping of functional networks, improving functional correlations and uncovering a network\u2019s deep brain nuclei components . However, this method has never been applied to explore the subcortical anatomy of the VAN and the DAN. \n\nDelineating the subcortical components of the DAN and the VAN would allow us to revisit their underlying circuitry through diffusion-weighted imaging tractography that enables in vivo reconstruction of associative, commissural, and projection white-matter tracts . A clearer characterization of the DAN and VAN circuitry will help to better understand brain interactions in healthy and pathological brains . \n\nSubcortical structures also play a critical role within the neurotransmitter systems. Brainstem nuclei are the primary sources of neurotransmitter synthesis and send axonal projections to the cortex and the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are central targets of the neurotransmitter axonal projections and mediate their physiological effects. Yet the neurochemistry of the DAN and the VAN is limited to primate studies. These studies reported a noradrenergic innervation of regions of the primate attention networks, including the temporoparietal junction and the frontal lobe . Noradrenaline has been proposed as a critical trigger for the reorientation of attention . However, despite its essential neuroscientific and medical importance , the neurochemical signatures of the VAN and the DAN have never been contrasted in humans. Such an endeavor is now possible thanks to the macroscale mapping of the neurotransmitter receptors and transporters in humans by means of positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scans . Accordingly, a normative atlas of nine neurotransmitter systems aligned in the MNI space is now openly available and allows the investigation of the neurochemical signature of brain circuits . \n\nTherefore, we explored the subcortical anatomy of attention networks by aligning the individual resting-state functional maps of the VAN and the DAN in a common functional space. Based on previous electrical recordings, pathological observations, and phylogenetic reports, we hypothesized that basal ganglia and brainstem nuclei, namely the pulvinar, the striatum, the superior colliculi, and the locus coeruleus, are core phylogenetically relevant and functional constituents of the attention networks. Finally, an optimized model of the VAN and the DAN was proposed together with their structural, functional, graph centrality, and neurochemical signature. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### VAN anatomical map \n  \nThe statistical map of the VAN, after functional alignment, is represented in Fig.\u00a0  (left column).

The highest median degree of centrality was the raphe pallidus nucleus and the left superior colliculus (the first and the second highest of all nodes, respectively). \n\nOverall, the subcortical structures had high centrality values in both networks. The betweenness centrality and degree centrality values of all nodes in the VAN and the DAN are detailed in Supplementary Tables\u00a0 ,  . The anatomical models of the VAN and DAN are illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 . \n\n\n### Correlation with the neurotransmitter system \n  \nThe brainstem nuclei identified in the VAN anatomical map that synthesize neurotransmitters are the pedunculopontine nuclei (cholinergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic; Benarroch ), the cuneiform nuclei (glutamatergic and GABAergic; Chang et al. ), the gigantocellular nucleus (glutamatergic and GABAergic; Martin et al. ), the raphe nucleus (serotonergic; Van De Kar and Lorens ), and the raphe pallidus nucleus (serotonergic; Heym et al. ). The brainstem nuclei identified in the DAN anatomical map synthesizing neurotransmitters are the pedunculopontine, the cuneiform, the gigantocellular nuclei, and the raphe pallidus nucleus. \n\nThe spatial correlations of these brainstem nuclei structural projections with the neurotransmitter systems are represented in Fig.\u00a0 . The distributions of acetylcholine \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors, dopamine transporters, and serotonin transporters were positively correlated with the distribution of VAN and DAN brainstem projections (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001; Fig.\u00a0 ). The scatterplots representing the distributions of the significantly correlated systems are presented in Fig.\u00a0 . Acetylcholine \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors and serotonin transporters had a higher spatial correlation with the VAN than with the DAN, whereas dopamine transporters had a higher spatial correlation with the DAN (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001).

In contrast, the correlations with the dopamine and serotonin transporters were higher in the right hemisphere (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study re-examined the VAN and the DAN neuroanatomy by co-registering individual network maps in a common functional space. We propose a comprehensive model of these networks based on the convergence of functional, structural, and neurochemical findings. First, we confirmed the initial hypothesis that subcortical structures, namely the pulvinar, the superior colliculi, the head of caudate nuclei, and a group of brainstem nuclei, are constituent elements of the attentional networks. Second, we characterized the structural connections underlying functional connectivity. Deep brain nuclei are densely connected and structural network hubs. Third, we showed that the identified brainstem nuclei projections are spatially correlated with the acetylcholine \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors and serotonin and dopamine transporters. \n\nPulvinar is a high-order thalamic relay nucleus participating in cortical-thalamocortical circuits that modulate information processing . Cytoarchitectonically, the pulvinar is divided into four regions: the anterior pulvinar, the inferior pulvinar, the medial pulvinar, and the lateral pulvinar . The medial pulvinar is particularly important in establishing connections with heteromodal association areas, such as the superior and inferior temporal, the inferior parietal, the dorsolateral prefrontal, and the orbitofrontal cortices . In our model, the pulvinar regions with the highest statistical level were medial, and we demonstrated that they were structurally connected with VAN cortical areas, through fronto-pulvinar projections, and with DAN cortical areas, by fronto-pulvinar and parieto-pulvinar projections . Pulvinar lesions may induce hemispatial neglect . Decades ago, Sprague impressively found that hemispherectomy prompted symptoms of hemispatial neglect in cats which were attenuated by removing the contralesional superior colliculus . This effect was later observed in humans . In our model, the pulvinar connects with the superior colliculi through the tecto-pulvinar fibers , demonstrating the importance of pulvinar\u2014superior colliculi interactions in attention processes. Therefore, in the context of the so-called Sprague effect, removing the contralesional superior colliculus in cats with hemispatial neglect would damage the spared attentional network and might partially compensate for the imbalance in the attentional processing . Recently, hemispatial neglect was linked to lesions of the human superior colliculus . The Sprague effect is also mediated by the pedunculopontine nuclei , which is one of the brainstem nuclei included in our model. The pedunculopontine nuclei possess a population of cholinergic neurons in their caudal portion, giving rise to a distinct network that regulates attentional states and enhances the processing of salient stimuli . The descending projections from these cholinergic neurons innervate the nucleus pontis oralis  and the gigantocellular nuclei , while their dorsal ascending projections innervate the colliculi  and several nuclei of the thalamus, including the pulvinar and the mediodorsal nuclei . The pattern of the pedunculopontine projections closely matches the brainstem and thalamic map evidenced in our analysis. Hence, lesion analyses and axonal tracings studies confirm the validity of our subcortical model of the VAN and the DAN. \n\nThe graph theory analysis results are consistent with the subcortical nuclei hub role in the VAN and the DAN organization. Centrality measures indicate how connected a node is with other nodes. These measures are considered surrogates of the node\u2019s relevance for the flow of information and communication within a network . The DAN and the VAN subcortical nuclei had a high degree and betweenness centrality scores, positioning them as networks\u2019 core regions as previously suggested . \n\nThe neurotransmitter system correlation analysis reinforced the proposed relationship between the subcortical nuclei of the attention networks. The highest spatial correlation of both networks was with the acetylcholine \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors. The acetylcholine \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors have a well-established relationship with sustained attention. Acetylcholine \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors agonists reduce adult monkey distractibility during matching-to-sample tasks with distractors  and increase the firing rate of dorsolateral prefrontal neurons during sustained attention tasks, an effect that is reversed by the co-administration of receptor antagonists . In humans, transdermal nicotine administration improves attentiveness . All these observations in animals and humans support the critical role of the subcortical acetylcholinergic system in attentional processes. \n\nThe VAN and DAN brainstem nuclei projections were also spatially correlated with the distribution of dopamine and serotonin transporters. This finding is consistent with the psychopharmacological knowledge about attention. Methylphenidate is the first-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . Pharmacologically, it is a noradrenaline-dopamine reuptake inhibitor with higher potency for dopamine transporters . Modafinil is a selective inhibitor of dopamine transporters  and produces attention enhancement effects . Further studies are needed to understand how the interplay between the nicotinic acetylcholine and the dopamine systems occurs in attention networks, but it might be mediated by their interaction at the levels of the striatum  and midbrain . Serotonin reuptake inhibitors also modulate attentional processes . They increase the perceptual bias towards emotional stimuli  by regulating the activity of visual processing circuits . Therefore, our improved model of the DAN and VAN functional neuroanatomy appears to reconcile previous neuroimaging and pharmacological findings. As previously suggested , additional pharmacological studies will be required to understand the preferential association of VAN with acetylcholine \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors. Similarly, pharmacological studies are required to shed light on the effect of serotonin transporter on the VAN and to reveal the relationship between dopamine transporters and the DAN. Finally, understanding the relationship between the neurochemical signature and hemispheric functional dominance still requires more research in animals and humans . \n\nCharacterizing the human brain\u2019s subcortical anatomy of attention networks fosters the exploration of a common structural-functional attentional framework across species. Attention is far from being a specific cognitive ability of human beings . Species with either close or distant common ancestors in the phylogenetic tree, such as monkeys, rats, and pigeons, can scan, select and maintain attention to surrounding environmental stimuli . A common subcortical attention framework may surpass the challenge of finding the cortical homologs of the human VAN and DAN in other species . Accordingly, future studies might use the subcortical areas we highlighted to explore comparatively the organization of the VAN and the DAN in non-human species. \n\nIn our analysis, VAN and DAN structural connectivity maps were right-lateralized. The right lateralization of the VAN is established in the literature. Evidence demonstrates that the SLF III has a larger volume in the right hemisphere and that its anatomical lateralization correlates with visuomotor processing abilities and the asymmetries of visuospatial task performance . The SLF I, the main tract connecting DAN cortical regions, does not show a preferential lateralization . However, some DAN areas might be right-lateralized . The right intraparietal sulcus  and frontal eye field  increase their activity for both visual fields, while the left preferentially reacts to contralateral stimulations. The processing of both visual fields in the right hemisphere is corroborated by right hemisphere stroke patients with hemispatial neglect who also present with deficits in goal-driven selective attention for ipsilateral stimuli . Hence, while the cortical extent of the DAN was not asymmetrical, our structural connectivity analysis, including the cortico-subcortical projection tracts, might have the function-specific dimension of the right lateralization of the DAN. \n\nRegarding functional connectivity, the distribution of VAN was not different between hemispheres, and the DAN was slightly left-lateralized. Task-based   f  MRI studies indicate right lateralization of the VAN , but the asymmetry might vary according to the nature of the task . Accordingly, while functional asymmetry is expected for some task-related activations , resting-state functional connectivity may not capture function-specific asymmetries due to its global nature. \n\nA limitation of our study is the inability to untangle the different roles and dynamic interactions between the proposed subcortical structures. While the cortical regions of the DAN and the VAN are quite neatly segregated , the subcortical nuclei described in our model probably contributed to both the VAN and the DAN. Future investigations using our model to explore the BOLD signal during task-related   f  MRI in humans or direct electrical recordings in animals might better dissociate the hierarchical organization and functional role of subcortical regions than resting-state   f  MRI. In addition, the neurotransmitter systems normative atlas is derived from different samples . As PET and SPECT tracers are radioactive, it is not possible to map several neurotransmitter systems in the same participants. Although the atlas was replicated in an independent autoradiography dataset and all scans were acquired in healthy volunteers , the heterogeneity of the data sources may represent a limitation for its interpretation. \n\nIn conclusion, this work proposes an improved neuroanatomical model of the VAN and the DAN that includes the pulvinar, the superior colliculi, the head of caudate nuclei, and a group of brainstem nuclei interrelated with the acetylcholine nicotinic and the dopamine and serotonin transporter systems. This comprehensive framework reconciles behavioral, electrophysiological, and psychopharmacological data and provides a shared foundation to explore the neural basis of attention across different species and brain pathologies. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Resting-state functional imaging (rs-  f  MRI) \n  \nWe used 110 7\u2009T resting-state functional MRI datasets from the Human Connectome Project S1200 . Images were preprocessed and registered to the MNI152 space as specified in the Human Connectome Project protocol ( ; Glasser et al. 2013). The Human Connectome Project open access data use terms were followed. \n\n\n### VAN and DAN maps in the structural space \n  \nVAN and DAN maps were computed using seed regions of interest defined in the functional cortical parcellation map . This template includes 23 VAN parcels (11 in the left and 12 in the right hemisphere) and 32 DAN parcels (19 in the left and 13 in the right hemisphere). This parcellation was performed according to resting-state functional connectivity patterns. Each parcel has a homogeneous resting-state functional connectivity signature and is separated from neighboring parcels by abrupt changes in their connectivity profile . \n\nWe calculated functional correlation maps seeded from each VAN cortical parcel using the Funcon-Connectivity tool implemented in the Brain Connectivity and Behavior toolkit ( ) . This tool computes Pearson\u2019s correlation between a seed region\u2019s mean resting-state activity and the brain\u2019s other voxels. Then, the median of the 23 functional connectivity maps (generated from the 23 VAN seeds) was computed to obtain the VAN\u2019s most representative map for each participant. We chose a median because it is less affected by outliers than the mean . 110 individual VAN maps in the MNI152 were obtained (i.e., one per subject). The same steps were performed to obtain 32 DAN maps. \n\n\n### VAN and DAN maps in the functional space \n  \nThe 110 individual VAN Pearson\u2019s correlation maps in the MNI152 space were aligned in a functional space to optimize their interindividual alignment of functional areas . We used the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) script \u201cbuildtemplateparallel.sh\u201d to perform an iterative (  n  \u2009=\u20094) diffeomorphic transformation to a common space . Cross-correlation was set as the similarity measure and greedy SyN as the transformation model . The resulting transformation warps were applied to the MNI152 aligned VAN maps, using the ANTs\u2019 script \u201cWarpImageMultiTransform\u201d to represent the 110 individual VAN maps in the functional space. The same steps were performed with the 110 DAN Pearson\u2019s correlations maps. A schematic representation of the functional alignment steps is available in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 . \n\nTo calculate group statistical VAN and DAN maps, we performed a permutation inference analysis using FSL\u2019s \u201crandomise\u201d one-sample (5000 permutations) and applied a threshold-free cluster enhancement . To evaluate the similarity between the VAN and DAN statistical maps, the t-maps were z-transformed, and a conjunction analysis was computed . A difference map was also calculated by subtracting the median DAN Pearson\u2019s correlation map from the VAN. Illustrations were produced in SurfIce ( ) and MRIcroGL ( ). \n\n\n### Anatomical validation of the subcortical structures \n  \nTo identify thalamic nuclei, we visually compared our results with the DISTAL (Deep brain stimulation Intrinsic Template Atlas; Ewert et al. 2018) and the THOMAS (Thalamus Optimized Multi Atlas Segmentation; Su et al. 2019) atlases. The DISTAL atlas is a high-resolution template of subcortical structures in the MNI space used as a reference to localize targets for deep brain stimulation . The DISTAL atlas segmentation was performed manually, based on histology, structural imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging . The THOMAS atlas is a template of thalamic nuclei derived from the manual segmentation of 20 White-Matter-Nulled Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo (MP-RAGE) 7\u2009T datasets warped to the MNI space . We used the WIKIBrainStem atlas to identify the brainstem nuclei . This template is based on mesoscopic T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images obtained from the ultra-high-field scanning (11.7\u2009T) of an ex vivo human specimen. It provides detailed segmentations of 99 brainstem structures . \n\n\n### Tractography analysis \n  \nWe analyzed the structural connectivity of the VAN and DAN, including the new subcortical structures identified in our resting-state functional connectivity analysis. Tractography was computed using 177 diffusion-weighted images from the 7\u2009T dataset of the Human Connectome Project . The scanning parameters are detailed in Vu et al. . Preprocessing was performed according to the default Human Connectome Project pipeline (v3.19.0) . The Human Connectome Project open access data use terms were followed. Tractography processing was prepared as described in Thiebaut de Schotten et al.  (available at  ). Briefly, a whole-brain deterministic algorithm was employed using StarTrack ( ), applying a damped Richardson-Lucy algorithm optimized for spherical deconvolution . Then, the individual whole-brain streamline tractograms were registered to the MNI152 space. First, they were converted into density maps, in which the voxel densities corresponded to the number of streamlines crossing each voxel . Second, individual density maps were aligned to a standard template using the Greedy symmetric diffeomorphic normalization of the Advanced Normalization Tools pipeline . Third, the resulting template was co-registered to the MNI152 2\u2009mm template using the FSL\u2019s tool \u201cflirt\u201d . Finally, the resulting transformation warps were applied to the individual whole-brain streamline tractography using Tract Querier . \n\nThen, we computed the structural connectome of the VAN and DAN models. The cortical nodes were defined according to Gordon et al. . To determine the subcortical regions of interest, we selected the statistically significant voxels of the subcortical structures identified in the previous sections with a median Pearson\u2019s correlation above   r  \u2009=\u20090.1. This correlation threshold was applied to avoid including voxels significantly associated with the network but with weak correlations . The streamlines that crossed at least two ROIs (cortico-cortical, cortico-subcortical, or subcortical-subcortical) were selected using the MRtrix3\u2019s tool \u201ctckedit\u201d . Afterward, the selected streamlines were converted into streamline density maps using the MRtrix3\u2019s tool \u2018tckmap\u2019 . The streamline density maps were binarized, and a group-level overlap map was computed. \n\n\n### ROI-to-ROI structural and functional connectivity analysis \n  \nWe used MRtrix3\u2019s tool \u201ctck2connectome\u201d to analyze ROI-to-ROI structural connectivity. The cortical and subcortical ROIs were defined as stated in the previous section. Regarding ROI-to-ROI functional connectivity, we computed the partial correlation between the network nodes using the nilearn\u2019s function \u201cConnectivityMeasure\u201d . The illustrations of the connectivity matrices were created with Matplotlib 3.4.2 . \n\n\n### Networks lateralization \n  \nWe assessed the lateralization of the VAN and DAN networks. For functional connectivity, the average Pearson\u2019s correlation across each hemisphere\u2019s VAN and DAN nodes was calculated using the FSL\u2019s function \u201cfslmeants\u201d. The obtained values were compared between the right and left hemispheres. For structural connectivity, we extracted the fiber tracts that crossed two nodes of the same hemisphere. Then, the fiber tracts were converted into volume maps using the MRtrix3\u2019s tool \u201ctckmap\u201d, and the individual volumes were compared between the two hemispheres . Data were presented as mean (with standard deviations) or median (with interquartile ranges), and paired analyses were performed with paired   t  -test or Wilcoxon test, according to their distribution. \n\n\n### Graph theory analysis of structural connectivity \n  \nTo analyze if the newly identified subcortical nuclei would be core regions in the networks, we performed a graph theory analysis of the hub properties of the VAN and DAN nodes. Two measures were used, the degree centrality and the betweenness centrality . Degree centrality denotes the fraction of nodes connected to the node of interest. Betweenness centrality is the fraction of all-pairs shortest paths that pass through the node of interest . In graph theory, nodes with high centrality are considered network hubs, i.e., they play a crucial role in the global network function . \n\nThe 177 individual binarized structural connectivity matrices were converted into undirected connectivity graphs, and both measures were calculated using the NetworkX package ( ). ROIs, as defined in the previous sections, constituted the network nodes. The streamlines that crossed at least two ROIs defined network vertices. Considering the conservative parameters of our tractography adjusted over the years to match post-mortem Klingler dissections , there was no threshold for the streamline considered for binarization. Additionally, the streamline count does not accurately reflect the number of axonal projections between regions or the strength of connectivity , and previous work showed that the overall results of the network analysis do not change with modifications in the streamline count binarization threshold . Then, we calculated the median value of both measures across the 177 network graphs for each node. The illustrations of the network graphs were created with SurfIce ( ). \n\n\n### Structural correlations with the neurotransmitter system \n  \nWe studied the relationship between the proposed neuroanatomical models\u2019 subcortical structural projections and the neurotransmitter systems\u2019 spatial distribution. First, we selected the newly identified brainstem nuclei that synthesize neurotransmitters, according to the cytochemical evidence in the literature. Second, we computed the structural projections of these nuclei to the remaining nodes of the VAN and DAN, i.e., we selected the streamlines that crossed the brainstem nuclei of interest and every other node of the network, using the MRtrix3 tool \u201ctckedit\u201d . Then, we used the MRtrix3 tool \u201ctckmap\u201d to map those streamlines into the MNI space  and computed the individual Spearman\u2019s correlation between the spatial distribution of the created structural projection map and the neurotransmitter maps provided by Hansen and colleagues using the neuromaps\u2019 tool \u201ccompare_images\u201d ;  ). We obtained the correlation values distribution between the 110 individual VAN and DAN maps and each neurotransmitter map. To analyze if the obtained distributions (each composed of 110 correlation values) were significantly higher than zero, a non-parametric statistical test was performed (one-sided Wilcoxon test). The obtained   p   values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction. Finally, we analyzed whether the correlation distributions were different between VAN and DAN, and if they were different between hemispheres (paired   t  -test or Wilcoxon test, according to data distribution; the Bonferroni correction was also applied). A supplemental pairwise analysis was performed. The average map of the 110 individual VAN and DAN structural projection maps was correlated with the neurotransmitter maps (Spearman\u2019s correlation; neuromaps\u2019 tool \u201ccompare_images\u201d;  ) . To control for spatial autocorrelations and reduce the risk of false positive results, statistical significance was inferred based on null models generation . Volumetric data were parcellated according to the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas 3 (AAL3; Rolls et al. ), using the neuromaps\u2019 utility \u201cParcellater\u201d ( ) . AAL3 was chosen because it includes cortical and subcortical parcels. The null parcellations were generated from the average VAN and DAN structural projection maps using the neuromaps\u2019 function \u201cnulls.burt2020\u201d (5000 permutations, generating 5000 null parcellations;  ) . The graphical representations were created with Matplotlib 3.4.2 and Datashader 0.13.0 (Hunter ;  ). \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0  linked to this article. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9729227, "text_md5": "5d27bd9f0ffefb259a5f75259f2920f6", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 104], "journal": [105, 116], "publication_year": [118, 122], "title": [133, 224], "keywords": [238, 264], "abstract": [277, 1888], "body": [1897, 46794]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 36477440, "doi": "10.1038/s42003-022-04281-0", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9729227", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9729227"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9729227\">9729227</a>", "list_title": "PMC9729227  The subcortical and neurochemical organization of the ventral and dorsal attention networks"}

We aimed to characterize developmental changes in brain activity related to the influence of a social stimulus on cognitive control and more specifically on inhibitory control. Children (age 8\u201311,   n  \u2009=\u200919), adolescents (age 12\u201317,   n  \u2009=\u200920), and adults (age 24\u201340,   n  \u2009=\u200919) performed an antisaccade task with either faces or cars as visual stimuli, during functional magnetic resonance brain imaging. We replicate the finding of the engagement of the core oculomotor and face perception brain regions in all age-groups, with increased involvement of frontoparietal oculomotor regions and fusiform face regions with age. The antisaccade-related activity was modulated by stimulus category significantly only in adolescents. This interaction was observed mainly in occipitotemporal regions as well as in supplementary motor cortex and postcentral gyrus. These results indicate a special treatment of social stimuli during adolescence.  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAdolescence is the transitional stage between childhood and adulthood: from puberty to independence from family. It is characterized by changes in cognitive control as well as changes in social behavior and social roles. These are paralleled by neurodevelopmental changes in brain structures ( ;  ) and functional organization ( ), with important interregional variations with regards to timing. Notably, brain areas involved in cognitive control and brain areas involved in face and socio-emotional processing follow delayed maturation well into adolescence (review in  ;  )  .   Here we investigated the functional integration between these 2 networks during adolescent development. We focused on a specific component of cognitive control: inhibitory control. \n\nMany laboratory tasks have been employed to study inhibitory control. The antisaccade, stop-signal, Go/Nogo, flanker, and Stroop tasks all require the capacity to inhibit a prepotent response. In all these tasks, performance improves during childhood and early adolescence ( ; rev in  ) going along with an increased engagement of prefrontal, frontal, and parietal regions with age ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nHere, we used the antisaccade task ( ), which is particularly well suited to study the interaction between inhibitory control and social perception across a broad range of ages. In the antisaccade task, participants are asked to inhibit their reflexive eye movement to an abruptly appearing peripheral visual target and to reprogram a saccade in the opposite direction. Readily performed by children and adolescents with good measures reliability ( ;  ), this task is well adapted to studying brain\u2013behavior relationships in these populations (for review see  ). Furthermore, making eye movements toward a stimulus does not involve an additional modality requiring mapping of the visual stimulus to a discrete response, such as pressing a button, and thus minimizes the influence of unwanted motion in the environment of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Developmental studies using the antisaccade paradigm have identified several parameters to characterize the maturation of inhibitory control, notably a speeded reaction time as well as time to correct inhibitory errors with age and, importantly, a reduction of inhibitory errors (antisaccade direction errors) with age with a stabilization of the effect around 14\u201315\u00a0years of age ( ;  ;  ; rev in  ). Developmental functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are consistent in showing that the basic elements of oculomotor and attention circuitry such as the frontal eye fields (FEFs), supplementary eye fields (SEFs), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), lateral occipital cortex (LOC), and insula present increased activity during antisaccades compared to prosaccades in children like in adults ( ;  ;  ). Data indicate that the extent and strength of activation in most of these regions increase with age during late childhood and adolescence ( ;  ;  ; but see  ;  ). In addition, the recruitment of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), known to be involved in error monitoring, increases between late childhood and adulthood, indicating the maturation of inhibitory control ( ). \n\nIn this study, we were interested in the interaction between social perception and inhibitory control across development, and more precisely we were interested in how social cues modulate inhibitory control when inhibitory control is still not fully matured. This question can be addressed with a version of the antisaccade task that uses different categories of stimuli as targets. Using faces, cars, or a noise pattern stimulus,   showed that participants had more difficulty inhibiting their reflexive saccade when the stimulus presented was a face, demonstrating that faces have a prevalent effect over other stimuli on cognitive control. Using a similar paradigm but presenting only faces and cars in an fMRI study,   found that performing the antisaccade task with a social context goes along with a modulation of brain activity in areas known to be involved in selective reorienting in adults, as indicated by an increased antisaccade-related activity in the superior frontal sulcus for faces. In addition, face-sensitive activity in posterior regions was also modulated as a function of whether participants performed an antisaccade or a prosaccade. \n\nSocial perception continues to mature during adolescence. In particular, face processing continues to improve until late adolescence ( ) and face selective brain areas, notably in the fusiform face area (FFA), continue to increase in size and specificity ( ,  ;  ). In a behavioral study using the same stimuli as in  ), we investigated whether this maturation is accompanied by changes in the control of spatial orienting in social contexts during late childhood and adolescence ( ). A core finding of the study was that the previously reported face-effect in the antisaccade task could only be observed starting in midadolescence, and that younger participants made the same percentage or errors for faces and other visual objects (like cars). \n\nHere we intended to extend these results by investigating brain activity during antisaccades to faces or cars in children, adolescents, and adults in regions involved in antisaccades (inhibitory control) and regions involved in face processing (social perception). We aimed to understand the influence of social stimuli on inhibitory control during development, but put in context of both the development inhibitory control and social perception. We therefore tested whether we could: 1) replicate previous developmental brain imaging results concerning the antisaccade network using social stimuli as targets rather than common meaningless stimuli; 2) replicate previous developmental brain imaging findings concerning the face network using an orienting task and peripheral stimuli, rather than common passive observation of central stimuli; and 3) critically, whether a modulation of activity during antisaccades as a function of the social nature of the stimulus could be observed in these brain areas, in different age-groups. To this end, we recruited participants pertaining to 3 age-groups: children (8\u201311), adolescents (12\u201317), and adults (24\u201340). They performed an antisaccade fMRI experiment during which they viewed 2 types of stimuli: faces (social stimuli) or cars (nonsocial stimuli). \n\nBased on previous findings on the maturation of brain areas involved in inhibitory control or face processing, we expected to find more engagement in adults than adolescents and more engagement in adolescents than children in the FEF, superior parietal lobule (SPL), and dACC (as in Luna et\u00a0al. 2010 and  ) for the task effect (antisaccades/prosaccades), as well as in the face network for the effect of stimulus (faces/cars), notably in the FFA. Furthermore, we expected that the stimulus category would modulate antisaccade-related activity only in adolescents and adults given our previous behavioral results ( ), and potentially in different regions, reflecting differences in how these 2 age-groups process social information. We expected to observe not only differences in activity, but also differences in patterns of activity reflecting local \u201cneuronal representation\u201d of stimuli. To explore this, we extended the analysis with a multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) decoding approach, probing for changes in regional patterns of activity as a function of task and their modulation by stimulus category. We expected a more stable representation (i.e., higher decoding from brain activity patterns) of task and stimulus with age. In addition, we expected the task representation to be modulated by the stimulus category only in adolescents and adults. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nWe recruited 39 children and adolescents through local advertising and word-of-mouth. All came from middle- to high-income families. We also recruited 19 adults through adverts posted on the university campus. To be recruited, participants or their legal guardians had to certify that they had no contraindication to MRI (absence of metallic implants or MRI-incompatible prosthesis, no claustrophobia), they had no history of neurological or mental disorder, and they also had to have normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no signs of color blindness. They described themselves as right-handed, except for 2 left-handed adults. Participants as well as the legal guardians of minors received information explaining the experiment and the contraindications of MRI that were discussed. They signed the consent form before the experiment. They were compensated with a cheque of 30 euros for their participation. \n\nWe had to exclude data from 1 adolescent and 5 children. Two of them were discarded because of excessive head movements, 2 had poor eye tracking pupil signal, 1 completed only 4 runs, 1 got anxious in the scanner. Thus, for the reported analyses we included data from 19 adults, aged between 24 and 40\u00a0years (mean age\u2009=\u200927.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1 standard deviation, 47.4% female), 19 adolescents aged between 12 and 17\u00a0years (mean age 14.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4, 37% female), and 14 children aged between 8 and 11\u00a0years (mean age 9.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9, 57% female). \n\n\n### Visual Stimulation and Eye Tracking \n  \nThe experiment was programmed using a dedicated software developed under the LabVIEW environment (2017, version 17.0, National Instruments). This software, using parallel programming, allowed synchronizing stimulus display with eye tracking and fMRI recording. The visual stimuli were displayed on a semitransparent screen with a resolution of 1280\u2009\u00d7\u20091024 pixels, placed at the rear of the scanner bore that subjects could view thanks to a mirror attached to the MRI coil just above their eyes. The eye position of the left eye was recorded using an Eyelink 1000 Plus Long Range Mount (SR Research Ltd, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), using corneal reflection and pupil tracking. The temporal resolution of the eye tracker was 1000\u00a0Hz. At the beginning of the session, we carried out a 5-point gaze-calibration. Before each run, the spatial accuracy of the eye tracker was validated against the same 5 points and the system was recalibrated if the worst point error was greater than 1.5\u00b0 or if the average error exceeded 1.0\u00b0. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nAs in  , we presented 12 images of Caucasian faces with neutral expressions (6 male and 6 female) cropped into an oval shape, as well as 12 images of cars. Both categories of visual stimuli (230\u2009\u00d7\u2009230 pixels, 4\u00b0 visual angle) were gray-scaled photographs on a gray background evened out for luminance, contrast, and spatial frequency, to diminish differences in local low-level visual properties. \n\n\n### Experimental Design \n  \nWe implemented an event-related design, mixing pro and antisaccades to faces and cars.   represents the time course of the task. Each trial started with a fixation cross displayed for periods ranging from 2000 to 8000\u00a0ms (sampled on an exponential distribution,  ), to introduce some jitter between trials onset and thereby improve design efficiency. A visual cue then appeared for 340\u00a0ms on the screen. The cue was a central disc (54\u2009\u00d7\u200954 pixels, 1\u00b0 visual angle) whose color (red or green) defined the nature of the saccadic task that should follow. A blank screen lasting 200\u00a0ms marked the transition between the visual cue (central disc) and the visual target stimulus (peripheral image) that was presented 10\u00b0 to the left or 10\u00b0 to the right of the screen center for 1000\u00a0ms. A green cue prompted the participants to look toward the appearing stimulus (prosaccade) and a red cue signaled that participants should look to the opposite side (to the mirror location) of the appearing stimulus (antisaccade). Participants were instructed to execute pro and antisaccades as quickly as possible. The experiment consisted of six 4-min long runs. Each run comprised 20 face and 20 car stimuli (40 trials in total) with 50% pro and 50% antisaccade instructions, randomized to the left and right hemi-field. We determined 6 different schedules (one for each run) using optseq2 (version 2.0, available at  ), optimizing the order and timing of the 8 conditions (anti- or prosaccades toward faces or cars to the left or right side of the hemi field). The order of the 6 different schedules was counterbalanced across participants. We explained the task to the participants outside the scanner and had them perform a 2-min long practice session inside the scanner before the experiment started to ensure that the instruction was properly understood. Participants took breaks varying from a few seconds up to 2\u00a0min between runs, during which we reminded them of the instructions. \n  \nSchematic representation of the antisaccade task. Participants are instructed to look toward the appearing visual stimulus (i.e., produce a prosaccades, PS) when the visual cue following the fixation cross is a green dot. They are instructed to look to the opposite side of the appearing visual stimulus (i.e., produce an antisaccade, AS) when the visual cue following the fixation cross is a red dot. \n  \n\n### fMRI Data Acquisition \n  \nBrain images were acquired at the Center for MRI of the neurosciences institute of La Timone ( ) using a 3\u00a0T Siemens Prisma scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and a 64-channel head coil. We first acquired a high-resolution   T  -weighted structural image (192 slices, time repetition/time echo [TR/TE]\u2009=\u20092300/2.98\u00a0ms, flip angle\u2009=\u20099, voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u00a0mm , slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u00a0mm, phase encoding direction: i-). To estimate magnetic field inhomogeneity and correct for this during functional data preprocessing, we also acquired a pair of images with opposite phase encoding directions (2\u2009\u00d7\u200954 slices, TR/TE\u2009=\u20097060/59\u00a0ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, voxel size\u2009=\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u00a0mm , slice thickness\u2009=\u20092.5\u00a0mm). Then, functional blood oxygen level\u2013dependent (BOLD) images were collected using an echo-planar imaging sequence (54 slices, TR/TE\u2009=\u20091224/30\u00a0ms, flip angle: 66\u00b0, voxel size\u2009=\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u00a0mm  slice thickness\u2009=\u20092.5\u00a0mm, field of view\u2009=\u2009210\u2009\u00d7\u2009210\u00a0mm , phase encoding direction: j-, multiband factor\u2009=\u20093, 190 volumes per run). \n\n\n### Gaze Data Analysis \n  \nGaze parameters were identified with the Eyelink Dataviewer Software (SR Research Ltd, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), using velocity and acceleration thresholds of 35\u00b0/s and 9500\u00b0/s , respectively, for saccade detection. \n\nFor each trial, the first saccade after stimulus onset that fulfilled the following criteria was analyzed: 1) The saccade latency was longer than 80\u00a0ms, as shorter latencies were likely to reflect anticipatory response ( ), 2) the saccade amplitude was greater than 2\u00b0 of visual angle, 3) the saccade direction was clearly classified as \u201cleft\u201d or \u201cright.\u201d If this saccade was in the correct direction (toward the target for prosaccade trials and in the opposite direction for antisaccades trials), the trial was classified as correct. If not it was classified as error. When no saccade could be detected, which could be due to no response or eye blink, the trial was classified as \u201cnull\u201d trial. In children, adolescents, and adults, respectively, 2.83%, 2.79%, and 1.82% of the trials were considered null trials. \n\n\n### fMRI Analysis \n  \n#### Preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing was done using Feat version 6.00 of FSL. Head motion was computed and corrected within runs using MCFLIRT. Subjects who showed a mean displacement over 2\u00a0mm were excluded from the analysis (  n  \u2009=\u20092). For subjects with at least one volume relative to the preceding volume with motion over 2\u00a0mm, we applied fsl_motion_outliers (  n  \u2009=\u20099) ( ,  ). This technique creates a confound matrix to remove the effect of these volumes on the regressors of interest in the general linear model (GLM). Images were unwrapped for distortion correction using   Topup   ( ) then the brain was extracted using BET. A Gaussian kernel of 5\u00a0mm full-width half maximum was applied to smooth the data. We also computed the nonlinear transformation matrices using FNIRT ( ), registering the   T   anatomical image of each subject to the 2-mm MNI atlas, to apply them to the individual results map and conduct group analyses. \n\n\n#### Univariate ROI Analysis \n  \n##### ROI definition \n  \nTo look more specifically at the stimulus effect in regions commonly involved in antisaccades and in regions commonly involved in face perception, we used a region of interest approach. Using GingerALE version 3.0.2 ( ), we defined regions pertaining to the \u201cface perception network\u201d or the \u201cantisaccade network\u201d by computing significant concordant activity in 79 studies, 91% of them conducted in adults, contrasting viewing faces with viewing objects and 13 studies, all conducted in adults, contrasting performing antisaccades to performing prosaccades (references can be found in  ). Studies were identified using the application Sleuth (version 3.0.3  ). The \u201cface network\u201d comprises of left and right fusiform cortex, left and right amygdala, right precentral gyrus, and the right insula. The antisaccade network comprises of left and right middle frontal cortex corresponding to the FEFs, left and right SPL (SPL including IPS), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG). These regions of interest (ROIs) were registered to each subject\u2019s brain using the inverse of the transform matrix computed during preprocessing (see above). \n\n\n##### Analyses \n  \nWe conducted analyses at each voxel using the GLM. At the run level, we modeled the BOLD response to correct saccades as a boxcar function featuring events starting at target onsets and lasting 1\u00a0s, convolved with a double-gamma function representing the hemodynamic response. We built one separate regressor (explanatory variable) for each condition: antisaccade away from face, antisaccade away from car, prosaccade toward face, and prosaccade toward car. We also modeled 2 additional regressors: errors and null trials. We added the first temporal derivative of each of these original waveforms to account for potential misspecification of the response timing. Only the parameter estimates for the canonical explanatory variables were taken to higher level contrast analyses. Before estimating the model, we applied a high-pass temporal filter to remove low-frequency drifts. \n\nWe then averaged the results across runs, yielding one map of mean parameter estimates per participant for each of the 4 conditions. For each participant, we computed the following contrasts of interest (Student\u2019s   t  -test at each voxel): 1) for the task effect: anti versus pro: (antisaccade face\u2009+\u2009antisaccade car)\u2009\u2212\u2009(prosaccade face\u2009+\u2009prosaccade car); 2) for the stimulus effect, since visual stimulation is very different for pro and antisaccades we considered only the prosaccades (for which the stimulus is foveated): proFace versus proCar: (prosaccade face\u2009\u2212\u2009prosaccade car); 3) for the interaction, we tested for higher task effect for face stimuli: (antisaccade face\u2009\u2212\u2009prosaccade face)\u2009\u2212\u2009(antisaccade car\u2009\u2212\u2009prosaccade car).   T   statistics were converted into Z values. \n\nFor each of these 3 contrasts, we extracted from within each ROI in each individual the peak statistical value (Zmax). These values were compared across age-groups using analyses of variance (ANOVAs). We also computed Pearson\u2019s correlations between these values and performance (percentage of antisaccades direction errors and correct antisaccades reaction times) to gain more insight into the brain\u2013behavior relationship. All these analyses were conducted in the R implementation of Jasp (Computer software JASP Version 0.14.1; 2020).   P   values were corrected for multiple comparisons across the different ROIs using the false discovery rate method (FDR;  ). \n\n\n\n#### Additional Univariate Analyses \n  \nTo explore main effects and interactions beyond our main hypotheses, we also entered the individual contrast maps in a voxelwise group analysis using a mixed-model approach with Flame ( ). We examined within-group (children, adolescents, and adults) averaged effects and across group differences. Individual global performance scores (number of correct responses) were entered as covariate to account for group differences in number of correct trials entered in the analyses (note that results changed only marginally without this). The resulting Z (Gaussianised Student\u2019s   t  ) statistic images were thresholded using clusters determined by Z\u2009>\u20092.3 and a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of   P  \u2009=\u20090.05 ( ). \n\nIn addition to the contrasts of interest aforementioned, we also computed the reverse contrasts: pro versus anti (prosaccade face\u2009+\u2009prosaccade car)\u2009\u2212\u2009(antisaccade face\u2009+\u2009antisaccade car); proCar versus proFace: (prosaccade car\u2009\u2212\u2009prosaccade face); negative interaction: (antisaccade car\u2009\u2212\u2009prosaccade car)\u2009\u2212\u2009(antisaccade face\u2009\u2212\u2009prosaccade face). \n\n\n#### Multivariate Analysis \n  \nWe performed MVPA with linear support vector machines (SVMs) as implemented in Nilearn for Python 3.7 ( ). We asked whether experimental conditions could be decoded from patterns of activity across voxels of each of our ROIs. \n\nFor this analysis, we fitted a new GLM at each voxel using each individual trial as a separate regressor (convolved with the hemodynamic response function). We then trained a linear SVM classifier on the patterns of each condition of interest (antisaccade away from face, antisaccade away from car, prosaccade toward face, and prosaccade toward car) in 4 runs and tested its accuracy to correctly classify the patterns in the 2 remaining runs. Participants\u2019 datasets were imbalanced due to response errors and eye tracker signal loss. To obtain unbiased model predictions, that is, to prevent biasing recognition in favor of the most numerous classes that may result from these imbalanced datasets, we performed bootstrap on our data, repeated 100 times. For each participant, 100 virtual datasets of maps of parameter estimates, each consisting of 6 runs of 40 trials, were created to train and test the linear SVM classifier in all possible combinations of train and test sets. An averaged percent correct classification score per ROI was then computed for each participant from the 6-fold cross-validation per bootstrap. Within each age-group, we compared these values to chance level using   t  -tests. To test for group differences, we submitted individual percent correct decoding score to a 1-way ANOVA with age-group as between-subject factor, in each ROI separately. To further examine the age-group differences, we performed post hoc pairwise   t  -test in each region separately and used FDR to correct for multiple comparisons. \n\nWe were interested in the task representation, the stimulus representation, and their interaction. For the task, we trained the classifier on classifying antisaccades as opposed to prosaccades. For the stimulus categorization, we trained the classifier on decoding prosaccades to faces (proFace) from prosaccades to cars (proCar). To question to what extent the stimulus category could impact task representation, at the level of regional activity patterns, we trained the classifier on decoding antisaccades from prosaccades in the face and car conditions separately and tested its decoding accuracy for anti- and prosaccades on the opposite stimulus category (i.e., train on antiFace vs. proFace and test on antiCar vs. proCar or vice versa). Absence of generalization across stimulus categories, that is, at-chance decoding of antisaccades versus prosaccades in the car condition when the classifier was trained on face stimuli or vice versa, would indicate such an interaction. Successful generalization across stimulus category, on the other hand, would suggest similar task regional representation and thus a lack of interaction. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Results \n  \nFor correct trials, prosaccade reaction time was on average 211.6\u2009\u00b1\u200977.7\u00a0ms in children, 175.5\u2009\u00b1\u200948.3 in adolescents, and 178.9\u2009\u00b1\u200938\u00a0ms in adults. It was significantly different between age-groups (  F  \u00a0  =  \u00a04.8,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.01). These differences in reaction time, of the order of maximum 33\u00a0ms are unlikely to contribute to detectable changes in the BOLD response, for which we considered 1-s long events and some flexibility in delay is accounted for by adding the temporal derivative. The stimulus effect and the interaction age-group\u2009\u00d7\u2009image category, however, was not significant (  F  \u00a0  =  \u00a02.23,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.1 and   F  \u00a0  =  \u00a00.35,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.7, respectively). \n\nCorrect antisaccades mean reaction time was also significantly different between age-groups (  F  \u00a0  =  \u00a012.09,   P\u2009=  \u00a05.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ), with an average of 273.8\u2009\u00b1\u2009103.1\u00a0ms in children, 215.5\u2009\u00b1\u200960.5\u00a0ms in adolescents, and 220.8\u2009\u00b1\u200953.3 in adults. Image category did not have a significant effect on antisaccade reaction time (  F  \u2009=\u20092.23,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.1). In addition, the age-group\u2009\u00d7\u2009image category interaction was not significant (  F  \u00a0  =  \u00a00.72,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.49). \n\nThe prosaccade error rate was overall very small (4%), and thus not further analyzed. The antisaccade error rate was 22% over all subjects across the 3 age-groups and image categories and decreased with age (antisaccade error rate in children\u2009=\u200942.93%; adolescents\u2009=\u200918.49%; adults\u2009=\u200910.64%;   F  \u00a0  =  \u00a049.4,   P\u2009=  \u00a01.8   E-  12; see  ). The effect of image category and the interaction between age-group and image category, however, did not yield significant results (  F  \u00a0  =  \u00a00.13,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.7 and   F  \u2009=\u20092.82,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.06, respectively). \n  \nAntisaccade error rate as a function of stimulus category (face and car) in children, adolescents, and adults. Bars indicate standard errors of the mean (SEM). \n  \n\n### Univariate fMRI Results \n  \n#### ROI Analyses \n  \nWe were mostly interested in task-related activity, stimulus-related activity, and in the interaction (differences between task-related activity for faces and for cars, respectively) ( ). \n  \nGroup-averaged Zmax in all ROIs in children, adolescents, and adults. Bars indicate SEM. (  A  ) For the contrast antisaccades\u2009>\u2009prosaccades. (  B  ) For the contrast prosaccades to face\u2009>\u2009prosaccade to car. Significant differences between groups (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05) are indicated by  . \n  \nTo assess to what extent the amplitude of the task effect changes with age, we compared the average maximal Z statistics (in the contrast anti\u2009>\u2009pro), in each ROI between age-groups. We found a main effect of age-group in the left and right FEF (  F  \u00a0  =  \u00a05.4,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.007 and   F  \u2009=\u20095.8,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.006, respectively), left and right SPL (  F  \u00a0  =  \u00a03.6,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.03 and   F  \u2009=\u20096.6,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.003, respectively), right precentral gyrus (  F  \u2009=\u20097.6,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.001), and in the rSMG (  F  \u2009=\u200912.2,   P\u2009<  \u00a00.001; see  ). We performed post hoc pairwise   t  -test in these regions to explore group differences in Zmax. After correcting for multiple comparisons, we reported significantly lower Zmax in children compared to adults in the left and right FEF (  t  \u2009=\u20093.05,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.02 and   t  \u2009=\u20093.24,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.02, respectively), in the right SPL (  t  \u2009=\u20093.55,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.01), in the rSMG (  t  \u2009=\u20094.26,   P\u2009<  \u00a00.001), and in the right precentral gyrus (  t  \u2009=\u20094.14,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.004). Zmax was higher in adults than adolescents in the rSMG (  t  \u2009=\u20093.00,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.008). There was no significant difference between adolescents and children. \n\nFor stimulus-related activity (proFace vs. proCar), we found a main effect of age-group in the left fusiform cortex (  F  \u2009=\u20093.8,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.03), with higher values in adults and adolescents compared to children (see  ). \n\nAs for the task\u2013stimulus interaction, for which the Z values were very low, we did not find any effect of age. \n\nTo get a deeper insight into the mechanisms underlying the task-related BOLD signal changes, we examined correlations between Zmax in ROIs of the antisaccade network and behavioral markers of performance, namely percentage of direction errors and saccadic reaction time for correct antisaccades, which reflects difficulty in performing the task. We observed significant negative correlations in FEF, SPL, and SMG (see  ). This relationship persisted even when factoring out age in bilateral FEF and SPL (although not when correcting for multiple testing in the left SPL), indicating that this association in the whole group was not due to global age-differences in performance but was rather related to the level of performance in the task: Participants who succeeded better in the task also exhibited more activity in the main areas of the antisaccade network. \n\nWhen looking at the relationship between brain activity and behavior separately for cars and faces, most of the correlations were higher and more significant for faces, especially for saccadic reaction times. To test which correlations were best supported by the data, we compared the correlation models in a Bayesian framework (using R as implemented in JASP). For all regions, there was more support for a (negative) correlation between percentage of errors or mean antisaccades reaction times for trials with a face than a car stimulus ( ). Note, however, that this comparison is qualitative and that the models are estimated on different data (hence against different null models). \n\n\n#### Whole Brain Analyses \n  \nTo get a more complete picture of age-related task- and stimulus effects, we performed an additional whole brain analysis.   A\u2013C   depicts above threshold activation loci in the 3 contrasts of interest: anti versus pro, proFace versus proCar, and task-stimulus interaction, respectively.   contains summarized information of activation peaks and group differences for these contrasts as well as for their opposite (pro vs. anti and proCar vs. proFace). Z (Gaussianised T) statistic images were thresholded using clusters determined by Z\u2009>\u20092.3 and a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of   P  \u2009=\u20090.05. Unthresholded Z-maps have been uploaded to Neurovault ( ). \n  \n(  A  ) Whole brain univariate results for the production of correct antisaccades (anti vs. pro) in children, adolescents, and adults. (  B  ) Whole brain univariate results for viewing faces (proFace vs. proCar) in children, adolescents, and adults. (  C  ) Whole brain univariate results for the task\u2009\u00d7\u2009stimulus interaction in adolescents. The contrasts are displayed at a threshold using clusters determined by Z\u2009>\u20092.3 and a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of   P  \u2009=\u20090.05. \n    \nWhole brain univariate analysis results \n  \nZ (Gaussianised T) statistic images were thresholded using clusters determined by Z\u2009>\u20092.3 and a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of   P  \u2009=\u20090.05. Coordinates for up to 4 peaks per cluster are presented. Subpeaks Z statistics, MNI coordinates, and approximate locations are presented in italic. \n  \nAs depicted in  , and confirming the ROI analysis, children, adolescents, and adults showed activity at the level of the FEF and IPS when producing antisaccades (anti- vs. procontrast). In addition, we observed significant antisaccade-related activity in all groups in LOC and insula. Both adolescents and adults\u2019 groups showed activity at the level of the ACC and the middle frontal gyrus (MFG). As for face-related activity (proFace vs. proCar), the 3 groups showed activity in the fusiform cortex, bilaterally. Children showed significant activity in the amygdala ( ). The task\u2009\u00d7\u2009stimulus interaction (antiFace\u2013proFace vs. antiCar\u2013proCar) was significant in adolescents in the postcentral gyrus and in the fusiform cortex ( ), in the left LOC, left precentral gyrus, and right superior temporal gyrus. In these regions, the difference of activity in anti- versus prosaccades was greater when the stimulus was a face compared to a car. Changing the threshold to   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 uncorrected revealed an interaction in the adults group as well, but in different regions than those observed in the adolescents group. These were located in the right superior and middle frontal gyri, paracingulate gyrus, and bilateral LOC (although not overlapping with the region observed in adolescents) and SPL. In children, even lowering the threshold did not reveal interaction between task and stimulus in any part of the brain. \n\n\n\n### Multivariate Analyses Results \n  \n depicts decoding accuracies in each ROI for each age-group. We found above chance decoding of anti- versus prosaccades in all regions involved in antisaccades (ACC, left and right SPL, left and right FEF, and in the rSMG) in all age-groups. We also found above chance decoding in the 3 groups in the left and right fusiform cortex. In addition, above chance accuracy was found in the left amygdala, right precentral, and right insula in both adolescents and adults, as well as in the right amygdala in adults (see   and  ). To test for group differences, we submitted individual percent correct decoding scores to a 1-way ANOVA with age-group as between subject factor, in each ROI separately, and we used FDR to correct for multiple comparisons. In the antisaccade network, we found a main effect of group in the right FEF (  F  \u2009=\u20094.268,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.02). We also observed a group effect in the fusiform gyrus (right:   F  \u2009=\u20099.866,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.0003; left:   F  \u2009=\u200910.84,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.0001), the right precentral (  F  \u2009=\u20094.813,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.01), and the right insula (  F  \u2009=\u20094.555,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.02) from the face network. To further examine the differences between age-groups, we performed post hoc pairwise   t  -tests in each region separately, when the ANOVA had revealed a significant main effect. These tests revealed better decoding performance in the right FEF in adults compared to children (  t  \u2009=\u20092.66,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.01) and in adults compared to adolescents (  t  \u2009=\u20092.16,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.04). In the right and left fusiform, right precentral, and right insula, better decoding performance was found in adults compared to children (  t  \u2009=\u20095.28,   P\u2009=  \u00a09.65E-06;   t  \u2009=\u20096.07,   P\u2009=  \u00a01.07E-06;   t  \u2009=\u20092.75,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.01;   t  \u2009=\u20092.83,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.009, respectively) and in adults compared to adolescents (  t  \u2009=\u20092.56,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.01;   t  \u2009=\u20092.08,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.05;   t  \u2009=\u20092.22,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.03;   t  \u2009=\u20092.17,   P\u2009=  \u00a00.04). In the left fusiform, we also found better decoding performance in adolescents compared to children (  t  \u2009=\u20092.71;   P\u2009=  \u00a00.011). \n  \nROI-based MVPA: mean percentage decoding accuracy in children, adolescents, and adults. SVM classification accuracy for saccade category (task) detection was averaged per age-group per region. Statistical significance was assessed with 1-sample   t  -test against 50% chance and corrected for multiple comparisons using the FDR method. Above chance statistical significance (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05) is represented by  . Significant differences between groups of   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 are represented by  . (  A  ) Saccade type (task) decoding. (  B  ) Stimulus type (category) decoding. \n  \nFor stimulus category decoding, we found above-chance levels of decoding in the left and right fusiform gyri in all age-groups except in children in the left fusiform gyrus (see  ). The ANOVA did not reveal any significant effect of age-group on correct decoding after correcting for multiple comparisons. \n\nIn all the regions where the anti/prosaccade decoding was significantly above chance (see above and  ), we observed also a significant decoding (  t  -tests corrected with FDR methods, all   P  s\u2009<\u20090.04) across categories, that is, when the classifier was trained on distinguishing patterns related to anti- versus prosaccades on trials of one stimulus category and tested on the other stimulus category. There was indeed no difference in performance between decoding within the trained category and across categories. This generalization indicates that the information carried in the pattern of activity of these regions that distinguishes antisaccades from prosaccades does not depend on the stimulus. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe investigated the influence of a social stimulus on inhibitory control, and the brain regions involved in this process during late childhood and adolescence. We addressed this issue by using an antisaccade task with social and nonsocial stimuli during fMRI. We carried out univariate analyses to investigate differences in activity in ROIs, defined independently as associated with antisaccades or with face perception, and were complemented by whole brain analyses to further explore potential differences in activity outside these networks. Finally, we conducted MVPA to capture the strength of the representations of task and stimulus in the ROIs in the 3 age-groups as well as potential differences between age-groups. We replicated previous findings of the immaturity of inhibitory control in children and adolescents: decreased reaction time and inhibitory errors in the antisaccade task with age; increased engagement of regions involved in producing antisaccades with age. Similarly, face-related activity in the FFA was observed in all age-groups, but its magnitude increased from childhood to adulthood. Adolescents were the only age-group that showed a modulation of task-related activity by stimulus category that remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons: Antisaccades-related activity was significantly increased for faces compared to cars in the postcentral and precentral gyri, in the STG, and in the fusiform cortex. We discuss these results in relation to previous literature on the maturation of antisaccade and social perception, focusing more specifically on adolescence. \n\n### Age-Related Changes in Inhibitory Control \n  \nThe observed decrease of reaction times of correct antisaccades and antisaccades direction error rates with age most likely reflects an improvement in inhibitory control. It replicates previous developmental studies on antisaccades ( ;  ;  ;  ; for review  ). It is concordant with a large corpus of developmental studies that showed that cognitive control improves from childhood to adulthood ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ; rev in  ). \n\nOur brain imaging analyses confirmed that the nodes of basic oculomotor circuitry\u2014namely FEF and parietal cortex\u2014are already identified at a young age and that they show higher activity for antisaccades compared to prosaccades (as in for instance  ). Their activity was correlated with task performance: Individuals who performed the task better (i.e., faster responses and with fewer errors) also showed higher activity in this network. This indicates that the identified change in BOLD signal was associated with the level of performance in the task, and thus to the correct inhibition and reprogramming of a saccade, consistent also with previous reports in adults ( ) and children and adolescents ( ;  ). The comparison of peaks in contrasts of parameter estimates (Zmax) between groups in the antisaccade network revealed stronger activity in FEF and SPL with age. This implies that, although all 3 age-groups recruit the same regions, the level of antisaccade-specific activity in these regions increases with age consistent with previous reports ( ;  ;  ;  ). These results, however, are at odds with other studies that do not find developmental differences in these oculomotor regions ( ;  ;  ). Most of these, however, report antisaccade activity relative to baseline thus mixing both inhibition and execution. Only  ), like we do in the present study, report the contrast between anti- and prosaccades, hence removing the effect of common sensorimotor processing for both prosaccades and antisaccades and isolating the effects of inhibition and reprogramming. They, like we do here, observe an increased activity in oculomotor regions. In addition, these studies (except for  ) used blocks of antisaccades and blocks of prosaccades. As mixing antisaccades and prosaccades trials increases task difficulty ( ;  ), the age-related increase in recruitment of frontoparietal regions may partly be due to increased attentional load. This goes in line with results from analyses of cue-related activity only that show an increased recruitment of these regions with age only for this anticipatory phase of antisaccades when participants have to adapt their task set ( ,  ). Moreover, MVPA, which normalized overall local activity, revealed that although the task (i.e., whether participants performed a pro or an antisaccade) could be decoded successfully in frontoparietal regions in all age-groups, the decoding accuracy was higher for adults than younger participants in the right FEF. This suggests that in adolescence and childhood, the task representation in frontal regions is still not as robust as it is in adults. In the dACC, another region often identified in antisaccades studies, we observed significant antisaccades-related activity only in adolescents and adults in the whole brain univariate analysis. Moreover, the ability to decode task from activity patterns was significant only in adolescents and adults (although at a relatively low level) and not in children.  ) also identified an increased involvement of dACC with age. The dACC is known to be involved in error monitoring and feedback ( ;  ). Since the involvement of the dACC is often associated with feedback signaling, its increased involvement with age could be due to less feedback signaling in younger age-groups and immature error regulation, as proposed in  ). This, however, is inconsistent with the study conducted by   that reported an increased involvement of the dACC with age for the task preparatory phase, but not during the task itself when error monitoring is potentially occurring. Because we did not have enough trials, we could only observe a more general immaturity in the involvement of this region in our task requiring inhibitory control. It would be interesting for future studies, however, to directly compare to directly compare erroneous to correct antisaccades trials with regards to dACC involvement. Another region, that is, sometimes reported in developmental antisaccade studies is the MFG (or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), but results have been controversial. Some studies report a decrease of MFG activation between childhood and adulthood ( ;  ). This is interpreted as a decrease in effort to correctly inhibit a response. Other studies, however, report an increase in MFG involvement with age, implying a delayed maturation of the MFG and of the frontal cortex in general ( ;  ). But even in adults\u2019 populations, the MFG is inconsistently identified during antisaccades, as shown by the fact that this region does not show up in the meta-analysis we performed to define the ROIs of the antisaccade network. It is most probably, like the ACC, involved in task-set selection and thus might not be much engaged in tasks using block designs. In their study,  , who used blocked design to compare saccade choice, inhibition, and selection, only found the MFG and ACC to be involved in the choice contrast, which in their case was the only contrast with high cognitive demand. This once again suggests that the involvement of these regions reflects higher level processes rather than inhibition per se. Our study not only mixes pro and antisaccades, in unpredictable hemifield, but also mixes trials with different stimuli, which for adults, adolescents, and children have probably different values. This may mobilize more resources linked to task monitoring and explain the significant activity in the MFG for trials necessitating inhibition and reprogramming of a saccade. This, however, was observed in adults and adolescents, but not in children. Thus, altogether our data indicate that regions involved in general task monitoring (like ACC and MFG), while very little engaged in children, show already an adult-like activity in adolescents. Activity in oculomotor regions, mainly the FEF in the right hemisphere, however, is still significantly lower in adolescents compared to adults. It would be interesting to evaluate how these results would generalize across other inhibitory control tasks that do not necessitate the oculomotor network. \n\n\n### Face Processing \n  \nAs expected, we found activity in children, adolescents, and adults in the FFA when they made a saccade toward a face. In addition, we found a slight increase in Zmax in FFA with age occurring mainly between children and adolescents with both adults and adolescents showing higher Zmax than children, concordant with previous studies ( ;  ;  ). This increased implication with age could reflect the cumulative exposure to faces with age ( ;  ). Previous behavioral studies point out that children, like adolescents and adults, are attracted early on to faces and spend a significant time looking at them, even though some aspects of social stimulus processing, such as face processing, mental state inference, and responding to peer influence and social evaluation, continue to mature until at least mid-adolescence (as reviewed in  ). \n\n\n### Interaction between Inhibitory Control and Face Processing \n  \nOur behavioral findings do not replicate previous reports of increased antisaccades errors for faces compared with cars ( ;  ). This could be due to the limited number of trials leading to reduced statistical power to detect small differences compared with studies conducted outside the scanner. Yet despite this lack of stimulus effect at the behavioral level, we could observe that the correlation between performance and brain activity in regions of the antisaccade network was better supported, in a Bayesian framework analysis, in the data with faces as stimuli, compared with cars. This suggests that the task-related activity is more robustly associated with success in the task, that is, inhibiting a saccade and reprogramming a new one, when the stimulus is a face, hence indicating a special status of social stimuli (at least faces). \n\nOur relatively small number of participants precludes examining these correlations in separate groups, however. In a larger developmental behavioral study (  n  \u2009=\u2009139) ( ), we found that although adults and adolescents had more difficulty inhibiting their reflexive saccade to a face than other stimuli, this was not the case for children, implying that the special involuntary attraction to faces would only appear in adolescence. This suggests that despite the lack of apparent effect at the behavioral level, we could still expect differences in the fMRI signal for the interaction between task and stimulus category between our 3 age-groups. \n\nMore specifically, we expected to find an interaction between task and stimulus in the antisaccade network for the adolescents and adults participants. This was not the case, that is, in these regions, the antisaccade-prosaccade contrast was not modulated by the stimulus category. This was comforted by the MVPA that showed a generalization of task decoding across stimulus categories: Task could be decoded from patterns of activity in all ROIs whether the classifier had been trained on the same or the other category of stimulus. We only found a significant interaction between the task and the stimulus in adolescents and in areas outside our a priori ROIs: Antisaccade-related activity was higher in the face than in the car conditions at the level of the postcentral gyrus, paracentral sulcus (supplementary motor area/SEF), STG, occipital fusiform gyrus, and LOC. It may not be surprising to find an interaction between task and stimulus in occipital regions like the LOC and the occipital fusiform gyrus since the visual cortex is sensitive to stimulus category and its eccentricity ( ) and displayed indeed higher activity for cars than for faces. The postcentral gyrus and supplementary motor cortex are more unexpected. Both these regions have, however, been mentioned in previous studies exploring antisaccades, with higher activity related to antisaccades as compared to prosaccades ( ;  ;  ). The fact that we observe these regions more in the face than in the car antisaccade\u2013prosaccade contrast and only in adolescents suggests that they may have a role in adapting inhibitory control to context and that this may depend on individual factors including age. In addition, the involvement of the STG could be due to its role in social information processing ( ;  ). This region is also known to show increased activity related to face processing from childhood to adulthood ( ). In adults, a task\u2013stimulus interaction could be observed only without correction for multiple comparisons, but in different regions, including the superior frontal sulcus (as in  ), middle frontal and paracingulate gyri, bilateral LOC, and SPL. This set of regions is very similar to what is commonly observed in voluntary covert shifts of attention (Grosbras et\u00a0al. 2005). Thus, it seems that the differential task-related activity as a function of stimulus might have different meanings in adults and adolescents. In adults, it might reflect the higher attentional demand over the automatic orienting to faces. In adolescents, it could relate to a special treatment of social stimuli. Indeed adolescence is a period that is marked by critical changes in both social and inhibitory functions ( ). Investigating the effect of reward on antisaccade performance, several studied reported less errors in rewarded trials as well as a higher engagement of brain networks associated with rewards in adolescents compared to adults ( ;  ;  ). They respectively showed an increased activity along the precentral sulcus (likely corresponding to the FEF) for the preparation of an antisaccade from a rewarded trial and higher ventral striatal activity during rewarded trials. This implies that in adolescents external factors influence performance on the antisaccade task, that is, inhibitory control\u2014as well as brain regions\u2019 engagement. Just like the reward system, the \u201csocial perception system\u201d also continues to develop during adolescence and reward and social contexts seem to influence adolescents\u2019 cognition to a higher extent than in children and adults. Thus, we argue that the effect of social cues on brain regions engaged during inhibitory control is different in adolescents from adults and children. The fact that social influence during adolescence is special, could explain that in adolescents compared with adults, the task\u2013stimulus interaction observed in brain activity is stronger and expressed in brain regions possibly more related to social processing. \n\n\n### Limitations and Future Directions \n  \nOne limitation of our study is that we compare brain regions for antisaccades in the 3 age-groups knowing that we have less correct antisaccade trials for children than for adolescents and adults. Although this was taken into account in our GLM, it remains a general limitation in developmental fMRI studies where participants are asked to perform a task that is cognitively demanding. Also, as in many developmental studies, we could not use data from all participants due to head motion. Our findings should thus be replicated with a larger sample of participants. Besides, we test the effect of social stimuli on inhibitory control by the presentation of a relatively impoverished stimulus consisting of faces with neutral expressions. Indeed to control for lower level visual stimuli, we presented gray-scaled faces and cars on a gray background. We recognize that more realistic social stimuli with possible increased saliency, like emotional faces, could have yielded increased influence on inhibitory control. It is thus possible that the use of impoverished stimuli might have had a different effect in adolescents for whom faces might have appeared \u201cstrange,\u201d children for whom both categories of stimuli might have appeared equally strange and adults who might be less sensible to the image manipulation. It would be interesting to reproduce a similar antisaccade task in which the faces presented are more realistic social cues, or with an affective or salient expression. \n\nIn addition, we presented adult faces as social stimuli, hence possibly creating an own-age effect in adults ( ). It would be interesting to evaluate this effect by conducting a similar study presenting faces from all age-groups and investigating the own-age effect on inhibitory control. Beyond age, it might be interesting to question whether group-membership based on other factors, like ethnicity would affect the specialized effect of faces. For instance, out-group membership based on ethnicity was found to provoke a different automatic imitation response than in-group membership, both behaviorally and in fMRI activity patterns when participants viewed faces belonging to in- or out-group ethnicity ( ). In addition, it has to be noted that, given our recruitment channel, mainly through University staff network, our sample is not be representative of the population at large. Indeed all participants came from middle- or high-income families; in addition, although not specifically intended in our recruitment, all participants were Caucasian. As individual factors (like ethnicity;  ) and environmental factors (like socio-economic status;  ;  ) can impact both cognitive control and social perception as well as brain organization, it would be interesting to extend this study to a larger population, to test the influence of these factors. \n\nIn conclusion, our results extend the existing literature on the development of the antisaccade network and the face network. We confirm that the core nodes are already present at a young age but that the strength of activity and pattern representations continues to increase during adolescence. In addition, we also found an effect of socially relevant stimuli on activity during inhibitory control in brain regions outside our ROIs, implying they are important for social processing. This interaction was observed only in the adolescent brain, endorsing the importance of understanding the adolescent brain as a crucial developmental period for social perception as well as cognitive control. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8597975, "text_md5": "11c7b65034aeaccbb47d1cbe5a7e02f3", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 87], "journal": [88, 107], "publication_year": [109, 113], "title": [124, 182], "keywords": [196, 267], "abstract": [280, 1359], "body": [1368, 55573]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 34806014, "doi": "10.1093/texcom/tgab057", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8597975", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8597975"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8597975\">8597975</a>", "list_title": "PMC8597975  Brain Activity During Antisaccades to Faces in Adolescence"}
{"text": "McCormick, Ethan M. and Telzer, Eva H.\nSci Rep, 2018\n\n# Title\n\nContributions of default mode network stability and deactivation to adolescent task engagement\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nOut of the several intrinsic brain networks discovered through resting-state functional analyses in the past decade, the default mode network (DMN) has been the subject of intense interest and study. In particular, the DMN shows marked suppression during task engagement, and has led to hypothesized roles in internally-directed cognition that need to be down-regulated in order to perform goal-directed behaviors. Previous work has largely focused on univariate deactivation as the mechanism of DMN suppression. However, given the transient nature of DMN down-regulation during task, an important question arises: Does the DMN need to be   strongly  , or more   stably   suppressed to promote successful task learning? In order to explore this question, 65 adolescents (M \u2009=\u200913.32; 21 females) completed a risky decision-making task during an fMRI scan. We tested our primary question by examining individual differences in absolute level of deactivation against the stability of activation across time in predicting levels of feedback learning on the task. To measure stability, we utilized a model-based functional connectivity approach that estimates the stability of activation across time   within   a region. In line with our hypothesis, the stability of activation in default mode regions predicted task engagement over and above the absolute level of DMN deactivation, revealing a new mechanism by which the brain can suppress the influence of brain networks on behavior. These results also highlight the importance of adopting model-based network approaches to understand the functional dynamics of the brain. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nWith the advent of resting-state fMRI, there has been an explosion of interest in characterizing intrinsic neural networks, as well as describing their various contributions to human cognition and behavior. Of particular interest to researchers has been the default mode network (DMN), a functionally-related system of regions which show greater metabolic activity at rest compared to task . Regions of the DMN include posterior cingulate, medial-prefrontal, hippocampal, and lateral temporal areas, and are often defined as regions showing strong functional connectivity with the posterior cingulate during rest . While the exact function of the DMN has proven elusive, it is involved in a wide variety of cognitions, such as autobiographical memory, spontaneous thought, and the integration of social information . Furthermore, disruption of DMN connectivity is linked to psychopathological states such as schizophrenia, ADHD, conduct disorder, and depression . \n\nImportantly, activation in DMN regions shows an inverse relationship with \u201ctask-active\u201d regions such as the fronto-parietal and salience networks. These networks show increased activation during task conditions , in contrast to the DMN, which often shows strong deactivation (relative to baseline) during decision making (i.e., \u201ctask-negative\u201d) . Furthermore, functional anti-correlations (i.e., connectivity) between task-active regions and the DMN are regularly seen during task  and are thought to reflect the degree of task engagement and attention . However, suppression (i.e., the down-regulation of a network\u2019s influence on behavior, often indexed by deactivation of the BOLD signal) of the DMN by task-related activity appears to be transient , with the default mode network coming back online quickly once task demands ease . Additionally, individuals who exhibit psychopathologies such as ADHD often fail to show DMN suppression , reflecting difficulties in maintaining sustained attention to a task. \n\nOne key form of task engagement is feedback learning, during which individuals must maintain mental representations of the task structure and reinforcement history in order to guide future behavior . Processes which impact feedback learning are important during adolescence, as teens are particularly sensitive to performance-relevant cues in their environment, showing both developmental  and inter-individual  differences in sensitivity to positive and negative feedback information. Given the role of DMN in disrupting attentional and engagement processes , failure to suppress DMN regions during task should be related to decreased feedback learning, as adolescents disengage (as a result of decreased attention and/or motivation) from task information. This disengagement could have particularly important consequences for adolescents, as deficits in the ability to learn from feedback can have negative impacts on adolescent behavior . \n\nGiven the transient nature of DMN suppression during task, one key unanswered question remains when considering potential mechanisms involved in down-regulating (or suppressing) the default mode network during task engagement: Does the DMN need to show   reduced   (i.e., a decrease in the absolute level of activation), or more   stable   (i.e., reduced fluctuations in activation) activity to achieve suppression? This question distinguishes between the mean level of neural activation (or deactivation as the case may be) and the stability over time of DMN activity as the mechanism by which the brain reduces the influence of functional networks on behavior. Under the first hypothesis, we would expect that individuals who show greater task engagement (indexed by increased feedback learning) would show the greatest DMN deactivation during task. Alternatively, feedback learning may be reflected in more stable DMN activity over time, as suppression of the DMN causes the network to become less responsive to changing task dynamics. Importantly, these two explanations may not be mutually exclusive, as stable and strong deactivation might co-occur. \n\nIn the current study, we tested the hypothesis that stability in task-negative regions of the DMN contributes to feedback learning (i.e., participants\u2019 ability to extract and respond to information cues from the task environment), over and above absolute level of deactivation, against the alternative hypothesis that suppression of the DMN is primarily achieved through reductions in univariate activation (i.e., deactivation). To do so, adolescents completed a risky decision-making task, the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using an ROI-based approach for both traditional univariate and model-based network analyses, we extracted parameter estimates of DMN deactivation and stability for each individual. We then entered these two types of parameters as simultaneous predictors of adolescents\u2019 engagement on the task. While previous work has focused on the absolute deactivation of DMN, we hypothesized that DMN stability would be a more powerful predictor of feedback learning than absolute level of deactivation in these regions. However, we further predicted that stability and level of deactivation would be positively related, with stronger deactivation being associated with greater DMN stability, suggesting a possible reconciliation of this hypothesis with previous conceptualizations of the DMN during task. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSixty-seven adolescent participants completed an fMRI scan. One participant was scanned using the wrong head coil, and another was excluded for excessive movement (>10% of slices with movement in excess of 2\u2009mm), resulting in a final sample of 65 adolescents (  M  \u2009=\u200913.32,   SD  \u2009=\u20090.62,   range  \u2009=\u200912.42\u201314.83; 56 Caucasian, 2 African American, 7 mixed race/multiple responses). Participants were largely from high income households (1 $0\u201314,999; 3 $15\u201329,999; 6 $30\u201344,999; 4 $45\u201359,999; 8 $60\u201374,999; 9 $75\u201389,999; 30\u2009>\u2009$90,000; and 4 not reported), with highly educated parents (3 completed a high school diploma; 8 completed some college; 4 completed an associate degree; 21 completed a bachelor\u2019s degree; 5 completed some graduate school; 18 completed a master\u2019s degree; and 3 completed a professional degree). Written informed assent was obtained for all participants under the age of 18, and written informed consent was obtained from each participants\u2019 parent and/or legal guardian. All methods were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations outlined by the Declaration of Helsinki and experimental protocols were approved by the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Institutional Review Board. \n\n\n### Risky Decision-Making Task \n  \nParticipants completed a version of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), a well-validated experimental paradigm  that has been adapted for fMRI in developmental populations . The BART measures participants\u2019 willingness to engage in risky behavior in order to earn rewards, and is associated with real-life risk taking in adolescents  and adults . During the scan session, participants were presented with a sequence of 24 balloons that they could pump up to earn points. Each pump decision was associated with earning one point but also increased the risk that a balloon would explode. If participants pumped a balloon too many times, the balloon would explode and participants would lose all the points they had earned for that balloon. However, if participants chose to cash out before the balloon exploded, the points they earned would be added to the running total of points, which was presented on the screen as a points meter. Participants were instructed that their goal was to earn as many points as possible during the task. Each event (e.g., larger balloon following a pump, new balloon following cashed or explosion outcomes) was separated with a random jitter (500\u20134000\u2009ms). Balloons exploded after 4 to 10 pumps, and the order of balloons was presented in a fixed order (after being pseudo-randomly ordered prior to data collection), although none of this information was made available to participants. The BART was self-paced and would not advance unless the participant made the choice to either pump or cash out. Participants were told that they could win a $10 gift card at the end of the neuroimaging session if they earned enough points during the task. The point threshold for winning this prize was intentionally left ambiguous so that participants were motivated to continue earning points throughout the task. In reality, all participants were given a $10 gift card after completing the scan session. \n\n\n### Task Engagement \n  \nTo measure adolescents\u2019 task engagement during the risky decision-making task, we calculated two indices of feedback learning. Specifically, we were interested in how adolescents used feedback information from previous trials in order to guide their current behavior, and to adapt that behavior when it results in maladaptive outcomes . Previous research using the BART has shown that adolescence is a time of increased feedback learning (compared with childhood), and that individual differences in feedback learning predict differences in risk behavior . In the current study, we were interested in two types of feedback learning to measure task engagement. \n\nFirst, we estimated how sensitive adolescents were to the valence of feedback on the task. To do so, we measured the impact of experiencing positive (i.e., a cash-out) versus negative (i.e., an explosion) on the previous trial. For this metric, larger positive values indicate that adolescents increase their pumping behavior following positive feedback and decrease pumping following negative feedback, while values close to zero indicate pump behavior that is random with respect to the valence of feedback that adolescents receive. Secondly, we estimated adolescents\u2019 sensitivity to the value (i.e., magnitude) of feedback on the previous trial, by contrasting risk decisions made after receiving low-value feedback (i.e., earning or losing points on a small or medium-sized balloon) versus those made after high-value feedback (i.e., earning or losing points on relatively large balloons). Larger positive values on this metric indicate that adolescents change their pump behavior more after a high-value feedback event, whereas values close to zero indicate that adolescents\u2019 decisions to pump were not impacted by the value of points earned (in a previous cash-out) or lost (in a previous explosion). Each of these feedback learning indices measure how adolescents retain relevant task information to guide their ongoing risk behavior. \n\nTo obtain these indices, we took a multi-level modeling approach utilizing the SAS software package (SAS version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Durham, NC), in which trials (24 balloons) were nested within adolescents, and the level 1 outcome was the final number of pump decisions made on a given balloon. To obtain our learning indices, we modeled pump number at the trial level as dependent on (1) previous feedback and (2) the size of that feedback. Consistent with previous research , we also controlled for the overall trial number and the outcome of the current balloon, resulting in the following Level 1 equation: \n\nTotal pumps on a particular balloon trial (  i  ) for a given adolescent (  j  ) was modeled as a function of the average number of pumps across the task (  \u03b3  ), the trial number (  \u03b3  ;   range  \u2009=\u20090\u201323), the outcome of the current trial (  \u03b3  ; coded Cash-Out\u2009=\u20090, Explosion\u2009=\u20091), the outcome of the previous trial (  \u03b3  ; coded Cash-Out\u2009=\u20090, Explosion\u2009=\u20090), and the size of the previous outcome (  \u03b3  ), in which we calculated a 75th percentile threshold for each participant\u2019s pump behavior based on their individual data. For previous trial outcomes on balloons where adolescents pumped above this threshold, the predictor was coded as 1, as points earned or lost on these trials were high value for the individual, while all other previous trials were coded as 0, indicating lower value earnings or loss . As our focus was on adolescents\u2019 individual sensitivity to the valence and value of previous feedback, these parameters were allowed to vary randomly in our model in order to gain individual effect estimates. Nesting of trials within balloons was achieved by modeling a between-person random intercept (  \u03bc  ) assumed to be independent and identically distributed and follow a Normal distribution with a constant variance (i.e.,  ). Finally, the individual-level residuals errors (\u03b5 ) were assumed to be independent and identically distributed, following a Normal distribution with a constant variance (i.e.,  ). In order to use these two metrics of task engagement, we extracted empirical Bayes estimates for each adolescent. Empirical Bayes estimates are optimally-weighted averages which combine individual- and group-level slope estimates, and \u201cshrink\u201d individual slope estimates towards group mean effect . \n\n\n### fMRI Data Acquisition and Processing \n  \n#### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nImaging data were collected utilizing a 3 Tesla Trio MRI scanner. The BART included T2*-weighted echoplanar images (EPI; slice thickness\u2009=\u20093\u2009mm; 38 slices; TR\u2009=\u20092\u2009sec; TE\u2009=\u200925\u2009ms; matrix\u2009=\u200992\u2009\u00d7\u200992; FOV\u2009=\u2009230\u2009mm; voxel size\u2009=\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm ). Additionally, structural scans were acquired, including a T1* magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE; slice thickness\u2009=\u20090.9\u2009mm; 192 slices; TR\u2009=\u20091.9\u2009sec; TE\u2009=\u20092.32\u2009ms; matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256; FOV\u2009=\u2009230\u2009mm; voxel size\u2009=\u20090.9\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009mm ; sagittal plane) and a T2*-weighted, matched-bandwidth (MBW), high resolution, anatomical scan (slice thickness\u2009=\u20093\u2009mm; 192 slices; TR\u2009=\u20094\u2009sec; TE\u2009=\u200964\u2009ms; matrix\u2009=\u2009192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192; FOV\u2009=\u2009230\u2009mm; voxel size\u2009=\u20091.2\u2009\u00d7\u20091.2\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm ). EPI and MBW scans were obtained at an oblique axial orientation in order to maximize brain coverage and minimize dropout in orbital regions. \n\n\n#### fMRI data preprocessing and analysis \n  \nPreprocessing utilized FSL FMRIBs Software Library (FSL v6.0;  ). Steps taken during preprocessing included correction for slice-timing using MCFLIRT; spatial smoothing using a 6\u2009mm Gaussian kernel, full-width-at-half maximum; high-pass temporal filtering with a 128\u2009s cutoff to remove low frequency drift across the time-series; and skull stripping of all images with BET. Functional images were re-sampled to a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009mm space and co-registered in a two-step sequence to the MBW and the MPRAGE images using FLIRT in order to warp them into the standard stereotactic space defined by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and the International Consortium for Brain Mapping. Preprocessing was completed utilizing individual-level independent component analysis (ICA) with MELODIC combined with an automated component classifier  (Neyman-Pearson threshold\u2009=\u20090.3), which was applied to filter signal originating from noise sources (e.g., motion, physiological rhythms). Global signal regression was not performed due to its tendency to increase distance-related dependencies in the strength of functional connectivity measures . \n\n\n#### Motion Correction \n  \nPrior to modeling the fMRI data further, we took several steps to reduce the influence of motion. First, as mentioned previously, we subjected each participants\u2019 data to individual-level ICA in order to remove motion-related signal from each participants\u2019 time-series. We also controlled for 8 nuisance regressors in the GLM and time-series analyses: 6 motion parameters generated during realignment and the average signal from both the white matter and cerebrospinal fluid masks. Finally, slices with greater than 2\u2009mm of motion were censored from the time-series (or modeled as a junk regressor in the GLM) to remove the effects of large, sudden movements on the functional data. No participant exceeded 5% of slices being censored (range: 0\u20132.5%). Previous work has shown that these strategies effectively reduce the influence of motion on functional connectivity analyses . \n\n\n\n### Regions of Interest \n  \nTo estimate how autoregressive stability in the default mode network impacts task behavior, we constructed 10   a priori   regions of interest (ROIs) based on previous neuroimaging work with this network (Fig.\u00a0 ). We based our ROIs off of resting-state maps of the default mode network . Regions included the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), bilateral dorsal superior frontal gyrus (dSFG), bilateral temporal poles (TP), bilateral hippocampus, and bilateral angular gyrus (AG). Regions were extracted from the templates using FSL. Most ROIs showed good separation from other DMN regions, however, in order to separate the mPFC and bilateral dSFG (which overlap in standard maps), we took additional steps to create 3 separate ROIs by zeroing voxels between the two regions with a z-stat\u2009<\u20096. This approach achieved appreciable separation for our masks. Individual masks were then evaluated again using the Marsbar toolbox in SPM  and FSL to ensure that ROIs did not contain any voxels that overlapped with another mask or exceeded the boundaries of the whole-brain mask. A 3D, navigable image containing all masks superimposed onto a single brain map is available on NeuroVault ( \u2009 .   \nDefault Mode Network. We defined 10 ROIs composing regions central to the default mode network (DMN). (  A  ) A 3D video of our   a priori   regions of interest in free space. (  B  ) Regions included the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral complements of the dorsal superior frontal gyrus (dSFG), temporal pole, hippocampus, and angular gyrus. \n  \n\n\n### Whole-brain Univariate Analyses \n  \nFor our univariate analyses, we modeled the BART as an event-related design. Whole-brain statistical analyses were performed using the general linear model (GLM) in SPM8. Fixed effects models were constructed for each participant with several conditions of interest, including pump decisions, cash-outs, and explosion events. The jittered inter-trial period between pump decisions and between outcomes and a new balloon was not modeled and served as an implicit baseline. A parametric modulator (PM) was included for conditions of interest and corresponded to the current pump number for the current trial at the time of event. This PM serves to control for differences across pumps within a balloon. For descriptive purposes, we ran whole-brain, group-level, random effects analyses for pump decisions using GLMFlex ( ). This approach corrects for variance-covariance inequality, removes outliers and sudden activation changes in the brain, partitions within- and between-person error terms, and analyzes all voxels containing data. Since this analysis was purely for visualization purposes, we thresholded the resultant statistical image at   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, with a minimum cluster size of 40 voxels. For the central univariate analyses, we extracted parameter estimates from each individual\u2019s unthresholded fixed effects statistical map using the 10   a priori   ROIs we constructed for the DMN network. \n\n\n### Time-series Analysis \n  \n#### Granger Causality \n  \nOriginally developed in the context of economic models , Granger causality emerges from a vector autoregression framework (VAR), where the contemporaneous and lagged relationships between a system of variables can be examined. A weak form of causal inference (compared to experimental designs for example), Granger causality relies on the intuition that   x   cannot cause   y   if   x   temporally follows   y   (i.e., cause precedes effect) . Based on this idea, Granger causality can be inferred if   x   at a previous time point (e.g.,   t   \u2212 1) predicts   y   at time (  t  ) above and beyond the self-predictive effect of   y   at   t   \u2212 1 on   y   at   t  . In other words, the combined information of   x   and   y   is more predictive of   y   than is   y   alone. Under this causal definition, it is possible for variables to Granger cause one another across time . \n\n\n#### Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME) \n  \nGIMME is a model-based network approach, which utilizes both individual and group-level information to derive directed functional connectivity maps . GIMME estimates connectivity graphs using both unified SEM  and extended unified SEM  to assess whether the presence of a path between ROIs significantly improves the overall model fit to the time-series data. GIMME estimates both contemporaneous (e.g., ROI  at   t   predicts ROI  at   t  ) and lagged (e.g., ROI  at   t   \u2212 1 predicts ROI  at   t  ) effects between ROIs, as well as the autoregressive (e.g., ROI  at   t   \u2212 1 predicts ROI  at   t  ) effects for each ROI time-series. Formally, a GIMME model for a set of   p   time-series with   t   measurements is: where   A   represents a   p   \u00d7   p   matrix of contemporaneous paths for the individual (  A  ) and group ( ) parameters, \u03a6  is matrix of first-order lagged paths (for the individual and group respectively), and   \u03b6   is the   p  -length vector of errors, assumed to be a white noise process, with means of zero, a finite variance, and no sequential dependencies (i.e., all temporal information is contained within   A   and \u03a6 ) . The diagonal of \u03a6  contains path estimates for the autoregressive effects (e.g., ROI  at   t   \u2212 1 predicts ROI  at   t  ), which represent the autocorrelations of each ROI predicting itself forward in time. GIMME assesses directional paths by testing whether a given ROI can predict another, controlling for the predicted ROI\u2019s autoregressive effect (i.e., establishing Granger causality). GIMME has been developed for both block  and event-related  fMRI data, and is freely available through the open-source R platform . \n\nIn contrast with many other functional connectivity approaches (e.g., graph theoretical approaches), GIMME constructs functional maps through a model-driven, multi-step processing of model building and pruning. First, information across all participants is used to derive a common network map that is representative of the majority of the sample. Group paths are only retained if they are significant for 70% of all individuals in the sample. All autoregressive paths are automatically estimated in order to accurately assess directionality in the between-ROI paths. Once a group map has been obtained, additional paths at the individual level are evaluated based on improvements to model fit for that individual. Unnecessary paths are pruned at the group level, and additional paths at the individual level are evaluated based on improvements to model fit for that individual. Individual-level paths are then pruned if they do not significantly improve the fit of the final model. This approach offers the unique advantage of being able to derive a group-level map that should be applicable to the majority of the sample, while still recognizing that individuals often show significant heterogeneity from the group map. This approach shows significant advantages over other methods in recovering \u201ctrue\u201d paths in simulated data while minimizing false positives . \n\nOur task provided two main challenges when measuring neural connectivity. First, our goal was to analyze connectivity patterns during risky decisions; however, the BART also contains feedback trials (i.e., cash-out outcomes, explosions). Secondly, our task was self-paced and as such, we needed a modeling approach that would allow for individuals to possess different amounts of data. Fortunately, GIMME is capable of handling unequal amounts of data between participants, as well as the inclusion of missing data . Missing values are replaced with placeholder NaN values to maintain the temporal ordering of scans, and neither contemporaneous nor lagged effects are estimated based on missing values. These features make GIMME especially well-suited to estimating connectivity graphs for the BART, allowing for the self-paced nature of the task, as well as specifically examining connectivity during risk decisions, without considering connectivity during outcomes. \n\n\n#### Autoregressive Paths \n  \nAutoregressive pathways are estimated as the predictive effect of activity in an ROI at one time point on that ROI\u2019s activity at the next time point. As such, stronger autoregressive path indicate that an ROI\u2019s activation is more stable over time. In our analyses, we were specifically interested in testing whether the strength of an individual\u2019s autoregressive paths was related to task behavior on the BART. As such, the parameter estimates from GIMME for each ROI\u2019s autoregressive path were extracted for use in subsequent regression analysis. \n\n\n\n### Analytic Plan \n  \nTo test the hypothesis that stability versus deactivation of the default mode network would be important for feedback learning, we took two analytic approaches. First, we utilized standard univariate analyses to extract each individual\u2019s parameter estimates of deactivation in the 10   a priori   DMN ROIs during risk decisions. Secondly, we took a model-based network approach using the same 10 ROIs to estimate stability over time in DMN activation. After completing both univariate and network analyses, each participant had 10 parameter estimates of mean activation and 10 parameter estimates of stability in activation over time. To avoid concerns of multiple comparisons by regressing each of these 20 estimates on behavioral metrics of interest, we took a dimension reduction approach through principal components analysis (PCA). PCA also offers a key advantage by partitioning variance into bins: variance that is common across regions (and representative of the DMN as a network), and variance that is unique to a particular region. Because activation in a given region is likely a combination of network- and ROI-level information, partitioning this region-specific variance out helps remove noise from our estimates that originate from individual ROIs. For both sets of parameters, we extracted the first principal component from a PCA where estimates from all 10 ROIs were used as inputs. We utilized the R function, \u201cprincipal\u201d ( ), to extract the first principal component utilizing the covariance matrix and varimax rotation. We ran follow-up analyses using the cross-validation function in the R function \u201cpca\u201d ( ), and results remained unchanged. These principal component scores were then used in subsequent regression analyses to predict task engagement (i.e., sensitivity to the valence and value of feedback in the task). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Group-Level Results \n  \n#### DMN Deactivation During Risk Decisions \n  \nWe first ran main effects analysis at the whole brain level, for descriptive purposes, to check for the expected deactivation of the default mode regions during decisions to pump across individuals in the sample. Consistent with prior work , adolescents showed strong deactivation of default mode regions during risk decisions at the group level, including mPFC, PCC, STS, AG, dSFG, and hippocampus (Fig.\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0 ). In contrast, typical task-active regions such as the anterior cingulate, anterior insula, and motor cortex showed positive activation during risk decisions. However, substantial individual differences emerged such that not all adolescents showed strong deactivation of DMN regions, and some adolescents even showed positive activation of DMN regions during risk decisions (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nMain Effect of Risk Decisions. The univariate condition of risk decisions showed robust deactivation across all DMN regions. Salience regions, such as the anterior cingulate and anterior insula showed strong positive activation. \n    \nNeural Regions Showing Significant Activation During Risky Decisions (i.e., Pumps). \n  \n Note:   L and R refer to left and right hemispheres; + and \u2212 refer to positive or negative activation; BA refers to Brodmann Area of peak voxel; k refers to the number of voxels in each significant cluster; t refers to peak activation level in each cluster; x, y, and z refer to MNI coordinates.

While regions of the default mode network show mean deactivation at the group-level, there are individual differences, including individuals who show positive activation of the DMN on average. \n  \n\n\n#### Network Map of the DMN During Risk Decisions \n  \nNext, we constructed model-based functional networks between our   a priori   DMN ROIs. While our focus was on the autoregessive paths, we estimated and displayed the full group model for descriptive purposes. Results show a strongly interconnected default mode network (Fig.\u00a0 ). In addition to connections between bilateral complements (e.g., left and right dSFG), the PCC, left TP, and left AG show many between-region paths. Importantly for testing our hypothesis, the autoregressive pathways for each of the 10 DMN ROIs were estimated for all subjects.   \nDMN Network during Risk Decisions. DMN seed regions showed strong interconnectivity (grey), with hubs such as the left angular gyrus and posterior cingulate showing several cross-region connections. However, for the purpose of the current study, our main focus was the autoregressive paths (black) which are estimates of within-region stability in activation. Autoregressive paths are dashed to denote a lagged temporal relationship. \n  \n\n\n#### Individual Differences in DMN Deactivation and Stability Differentially Predict Feedback Learning \n  \nFinally, our key analysis explored individual differences in deactivation (from the univariate analyses) and stability (from the functional network analyses) in DMN regions to task engagement. We took parameter estimates of univariate activation and autoregressive strength for each of the 10   a priori   DMN regions and ran separate PCA analyses on each type of parameter and obtained one score per person, per analysis. For univariate analyses, this analysis resulted in a representative level of deactivation across DMN regions. For network analyses on the autoregressive paths, the PCA score reflected representative activational stability in the DMN as a whole (see Table\u00a0  for factor loadings to each principal component).   \nFactor Loadings for Regions of DMN on Principal Components for Mean Levels of Deactivation and Autoregressive Stability. \n  \n\nNext, we entered both of the scores into a multiple regression analysis with adolescents\u2019 two indices of feedback learning (i.e., sensitivity to the valence and sensitivity to the value of previous feedback) as our outcomes in two separate analyses (thresholded at   p  \u2009=\u20090.025 to correct for multiple comparisons). Results showed that DMN stability (  B  \u2009=\u20090.063,   SE  \u2009=\u20090.026,   p  \u2009=\u20090.018) but not mean deactivation (  B  \u2009=\u20090.025,   SE  \u2009=\u20090.026,   p  \u2009=\u20090.349), is associated with adolescents\u2019 sensitivity to the valence of the previous outcome. Similarly, stability (  B  \u2009=\u20090.150,   SE  \u2009=\u20090.048,   p  \u2009=\u20090.003) but not deactivation (  B  \u2009=\u20090.033,   SE  \u2009=\u20090.048,   p  \u2009=\u20090.487) is associated with adolescents\u2019 sensitivity to the value (i.e., magnitude) of previous feedback on the task. Furthermore, the two factor scores were uncorrelated (  r  \u2009=\u20090.112,   p  \u2009=\u20090.376), meaning that deactivation did not indicate more stability in DMN activity, nor were interactions between deactivation and stability predictive of feedback learning (  p  \u2009=\u20090.186 and   p  \u2009=\u20090.963 respectively). These results suggest that stability in DMN activity, even if that activity is positive on average (as is characteristic of some adolescents; Fig.\u00a0 ), is more predictive of adolescents\u2019 feedback learning than absolute level of (de)activation. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe exact role of the default mode network in cognition and behavior remains an important open question for cognitive neuroscientists. Traditionally, the DMN has been conceptualized as a \u201ctask negative\u201d network , with suppression of the network being important for normal decision-making processes and task engagement . Indeed, DMN suppression is an important marker of task engagement , showing linear deactivation as the difficulty of the task increases . Furthermore, disruption of DMN suppression is thought to contribute to attention-related disorders such as ADHD . However, unanswered questions remain as to the mechanism by which DMN suppression is implemented in the brain. We utilized both traditional univariate, as well as a novel, model-based network approach to test two competing hypotheses related to this mechanism of DMN suppression. Consistent with previous work , main effects analyses showed characteristic deactivation in DMN regions during task. Furthermore, the group connectivity map revealed large numbers of connections between central DMN nodes (e.g., PCC and angular gyrus) and the other nodes of the network. We then used the overall level of DMN deactivation and stability in DMN activation across time to assess whether the absolute level or stability in DMN activation was related to task engagement, operationalized as adolescents\u2019 ability to extract and use feedback information learned from the task environment. \n\nIn line with our hypothesis, the stability of activation in default mode regions (as estimated by the autoregressive pathways in GIMME) predicted both metrics of feedback learning over and above the absolute level of DMN deactivation (as measured through the univariate contrast). Indeed, adolescents\u2019 mean level of deactivation in DMN was not a significant predictor of either metric of feedback learning within the task. Interestingly, DMN deactivation was uncorrelated with the stability within those regions, suggesting that highly stable DMN activation was possible even when the DMN showed positive activation during the task. These results suggest that the brain may be able to suppress the influence of neural regions during a task without an apparent change in resource consumption (at least as measured by the BOLD signal). \n\nThe implications of the current study offer promise for future research for two reasons. First, the current results offer a validation for the adoption of model-based network approaches for functional data. Traditional approaches to functional connectivity (e.g., seed-based, graph theoretical) only consider concurrent relationships between ROIs. However, methods such as GIMME  and other vector autoregression  (VAR) models are capable of estimating both concurrent and lagged effects, which improve network model fit for each individual. Importantly for the current study, GIMME automatically estimates autoregressive paths (i.e., lagged effects within an ROI) as part of its model-building approach, allowing us to examine the temporal stability of activation across time. Our finding that activational stability, as measured through these autoregressive paths, is key for promoting feedback learning highlights the importance of considering these lagged effects and provides encouragement for an increased focus on model-based network approaches that can estimate them. \n\nSecondly, the implication of the current results (i.e., that network influence can be suppressed through stability rather than through deactivation) raises questions about the inferences made about negative BOLD estimates (i.e., deactivation) in fMRI. While deactivation is often viewed as synonymous with a reduced role in decision making processes, the fact that deactivation is not correlated with stability suggests that a highly-deactivated region can still show low stability in activation across the task. Furthermore, we found unexpected variability in the mean level of deactivation in the DMN at the main effect level, such that some adolescents showed the expected pattern of strong DMN deactivation whereas others showed weak deactivation or even positive activation. This suggests that deactivation of the DMN may not be a universal phenomenon during decision making, and that a failure to deactivate DMN does not   a priori   impair performance on the task. Whether there are differences in the behavioral profiles associated with activation fluctuations between individuals who show strongly versus weakly deactivated DMN remains an open question, as the current sample is likely underpowered to detect interaction effects. Future research may be able to address this by examining the interaction between stability and level of deactivation in the DMN, and the consequences of different configurations (e.g., low stability and strong deactivation versus high stability and strong deactivation) for task behavior. \n\nFor future research, unanswered questions to consider are the potential mechanisms by which the brain instantiates stability in activation in the DMN regions. One possibility is that task-relevant regions (e.g., ACC, insula) or some third set of regions actively suppresses DMN involvement during task by producing signals which down-regulate default mode regions. Alternatively, other networks could simply disengage from DMN regions. By increasing the segregation between networks, the brain may isolate the DMN, decreasing its ability to influence cognition and behavior. Uncovering the mechanism that instantiates DMN suppression is important for understanding both normal cognition but also has implications for disease states which are associated with disruptions to the DMN . \n\nIn conclusion, we tested two competing hypotheses related to the suppression of the default mode network during a risky decision-making task. In contrast with a focus on the mean level of deactivation, we proposed that stability in activation, rather than absolute level, would be a more-important mechanism for reduced DMN influence on feedback learning. We adopted both traditional univariate and a novel model-based network approach to test these hypotheses, and found support for our hypothesis that increased DMN stability is related to increased sensitivity to information from the task (i.e., learning). These results shed light on a new mechanism by which the brain reduces the influence of a functional network, and highlights the importance of adopting network methods which consider both contemporaneous and lagged effects. \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6303343, "text_md5": "2af7450da74f39d8aebfa4250e5c2c49", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 38], "journal": [39, 46], "publication_year": [48, 52], "title": [63, 157], "keywords": [171, 171], "abstract": [184, 1808], "body": [1817, 40737]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 30575799, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-018-36269-4", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6303343", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6303343"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6303343\">6303343</a>", "list_title": "PMC6303343  Contributions of default mode network stability and deactivation to adolescent task engagement"}

Despite being recognized as prominent nodes of the networks underlying spatial attention and oculomotor control, and working memory and cognitive control, respectively, the limited quantitative evidence on their precise localization has considerably impeded the detailed understanding of their structure and connectivity. In this study, we performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) fMRI meta-analysis by selecting studies that employed standard paradigms to accurately infer the localization of these regions in stereotaxic space. For the FEF, we found the highest spatial convergence of activations for prosaccade and antisaccade paradigms at the junction of the precentral sulcus and superior frontal sulcus. For the IFJ, we found consistent activations across oddball/attention, working memory, task-switching and Stroop paradigms at the junction of the inferior precentral sulcus and inferior frontal sulcus. We related these clusters to previous meta-analyses, sulcal/gyral neuroanatomy, and a comprehensive brain parcellation, highlighting important differences compared to their results and taxonomy. Finally, we leveraged the ALE peak coordinates as seeds to perform a meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) analysis, which revealed systematic coactivation patterns spanning the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. We decoded the behavioral domains associated with these coactivations, suggesting that these may allow FEF and IFJ to support their specialized roles in flexible behavior. Our study provides the meta-analytic groundwork for investigating the relationship between functional specialization and connectivity of two crucial control structures of the prefrontal cortex. \n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00429-023-02641-y. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOwing to the capabilities that likely derive from the massive expansion in the cortical surface area\u00a0allowed by the folding patterns of the cortex (Van Essen  ; Zilles et al.  ), which particularly involved the prefrontal and association cortices (Donahue et al.  ; Toro et al.  ), humans possess one of the most complex behavioral repertoires in nature (Mesulam  ; Miller and Cohen  ). A fundamental aspect of functional specialization in the human brain is its relationship with cortical neuroanatomy (Van Essen  ). Microstructural features pertaining to cortical architecture (i.e., cyto- and myelo-architecture), such as cell types and layer organization, are a major determinant of the functional organization of the brain, and they provide important information about regional segregation (Amunts et al.  ). Over the past 30\u00a0years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; and in particular, fMRI) became the dominant technique for investigating this organization non-invasively and in vivo (Eickhoff et al.  ). Although regional delineations inferred based on architectonic criteria (e.g., cytoarchitecture) generally agree well with information gathered from MRI (Amunts and Zilles  ), such correspondences should be always interpreted with caution. These criteria may be weak predictors of functional organization in highly heterogeneous regions, for example when regions sit at the boundary of different Brodmann areas (BA; Amunts and Zilles  ; Brodmann  ). Moreover, this relationship may be affected by strong inter-individual differences, which were not taken into account in most of the previous invasive studies characterized by relatively small sample sizes (Amunts and Zilles  ). In addition to the previous prevalent invasive and lesion-based approaches, another way of conceptualizing functional organization and, more in general, the relationship between cognitive processes and their neural substrate, emerged from fMRI research with the functional localization approach (Kanwisher  ). Specialized processes are performed by brain regions that can be reliably identified across individuals with fMRI using standard tasks (hence referred to as functional localizers; Kanwisher  ; Rosenke et al.  ). In combination with the functional localization approach, research on structural MRI has shown that, despite the remarkable inter-individual variability in the organization of the gyri and sulci (Desikan et al.  ; Destrieux et al.  ; Ono et al.  ; Petrides  ), these functional modules can also be localized based on anatomical landmarks (Fischl et al.  ), which suggests a developmental link between the functional differentiation of brain regions and the mechanisms of cortical maturation (Zilles et al.  ). \n\nIn sum, in the human brain, functional specialization appears to be tightly linked and possibly follows from brain structure, although it remains to be established exactly to what degree this principle holds within specific systems. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), two lateral structures, the frontal eye field (FEF) and the inferior frontal junction (IFJ) have largely overlapping but complementary roles, being involved in several orchestrating functions such as attention, working memory, cognitive control, and other top-down processes (Baldauf and Desimone  ; Bedini and Baldauf  ). In our previous review, we argued that despite these overlaps, it is their patterns of neural selectivity to spatial (FEF) vs non-spatial information (IFJ) that allow the dissociation of their role across these different functions (Bedini and Baldauf  ). This functional specialization may in turn provide an effective way to localize these regions with MRI. While the FEF has been studied extensively in humans and non-human primates, its precise localization and relationship to sulcal morphology in humans, and correspondence to the macaque FEF has proven to be difficult to establish (Amiez and Petrides  ; Petit and Pouget  ; Schall et al.  ; Tehovnik et al.  ; but see Koyama et al.  ). Neuroimaging evidence also suggests that FEF localization may be affected by substantial individual differences (Amiez et al.  ; Kastner et al.  ; Paus  ; see Bedini and Baldauf   for a discussion). The prevailing view is that the human FEF lies in the ventral bank of the superior precentral sulcus (sPCS), near its junction with the superior frontal sulcus (SFS; see Paus   and Vernet et al.  , for a meta-analysis and a review of FEF localization, respectively). However, some authors have argued that instead, a region localized ventrally in the dorsal branch of the inferior PCS (iPCS), termed the inferior FEF (iFEF, or sometimes the lateral FEF) may be the putative homolog of the macaque FEF (Kastner et al.  ; Schall et al.  ). Moreover, it has been raised the related question of whether the inferior FEF has been under-reported in the fMRI literature (Derrfuss et al.  ). In topographic mapping studies, peaks corresponding to the iFEF have been already reported (Kastner et al.  ; Mackey et al.  ) albeit they were not as consistent as FEF peaks in their presence across subjects and relative localization. Moreover, one study reported activations in the iFEF using a saccadic localizer task, which were clearly segregated from those elicited by a Stroop task (Derrfuss et al.  ). These analyses were performed in native space on an individual-subject basis, which is a very powerful approach that allows for carefully studying dissociations in adjacent neuroanatomical regions (Fedorenko  ). The IFJ, a region found ventrally and anteriorly relative to the iFEF, is typically localized near the junction of the iPCS with the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), sometimes encroaching into its caudal bank (Derrfuss et al.  ). The IFJ was only much more recently characterized as a separate brain region (based on structural; Amunts and Von Cramon  ; and functional criteria; Brass et al.  ) that performs\u00a0both\u00a0specialized (Baldauf and Desimone  ; Bedini and Baldauf  ; De Vries et al.  ) and general domain processes (Assem et al.  ; Derrfuss et al.  ), in line with the multiple-demand hypothesis (Duncan  ). Currently, however, due to the interspersed and close arrangement of specialized and multiple-demand regions near the IFJ, common activation foci resulting from various cognitive processes have not been reported yet across experiments (see, however, Assem et al.  ). \n\nClearly, there is a need to better characterize the relationship between anatomy and functional specialization within the PFC. This is particularly critical, as the large inter-individual variability in the organization of the prefrontal areas and sulci (Germann et al.  ; Juch et al.  ) complicates the interpretation of the results of previous studies and may partly explain the discrepancies in the findings reported across research groups and methods. That such a link can in principle be successfully accomplished has been demonstrated in the visual system, where studies have shown that despite the inter-individual variability in the surface area of the early visual cortex (Benson et al.  ), specific anatomical landmarks (i.e., sulci) coincide very well with the borders of early visual areas as derived from various sources of data, including cytoarchitecture, retinotopic mapping, myelin content and resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (Abdollahi et al.  ; Fischl et al.  ; Glasser et al.  ; Sereno et al. 1995). Hinds et al. ( ) used surface-based registration methods (Fischl et al.  ) to identify V1 in new subjects from cortical folding information (i.e., the stria of Gennari) and showed that these methods outperformed volumetric methods in labeling this structure. Similarly, Benson et al. ( ) used folding information to predict visual responses within the striate cortex to a retinotopic mapping fMRI protocol. When moving up into the cortical visual hierarchy, however, the relationships between cortical folding and other neuroanatomical information become more difficult to establish and interpret (Coalson et al.  ; Glasser et al.  ). Wang et al. ( ) created a probabilistic atlas of 25 topographic visual areas and showed that anatomical variability (as measured by the variance in gyral-sulcal convexity across subjects) and the overlap of functional activations (measured as peak probability values) were negatively correlated, particularly in higher-order visual areas, suggesting that the former may play an important role in shaping their functional organization. In one of the most comprehensive efforts to parcel the cortical surface with high-resolution non-invasive methods, Glasser et al. ( ) found that the lateral PFC is one of the brain districts where the intrinsic neuroanatomical variability is higher than in the rest of the brain (see also Juch et al.  ), as measured by a decrease in the test\u2013retest reliability of their multimodal parcellation (MMP1). While the former limitations (i.e., the weaker association between cortical folding and function, and inter-individual variability, which particularly affects volumetric group-level analyses; Coalson et al.  ) have posed significant challenges to the interpretation of the relationship between cortical folding and functional specialization in higher-order visual regions, several studies have shown that adopting an individual-level approach in defining sulci may bear important implications for understanding cognitive function within the PFC (Amiez et al.  ; Amiez and Petrides  ; Derrfuss et al.  ; Fedorenko  ; Miller et al.  ). For example, the study by Frost and Goebel ( ) showed that, by leveraging the former approach and improving the alignment in the cortical folding patterns using a technique termed curvature-driven cortex-based alignment, the overlap in FEF localization increased by 66.7% in the left hemisphere and 106.5% in the right hemisphere compared to volume-based registration in a sample of 10 subjects. These results suggest that the FEF is indeed strongly bound to a macro-anatomical location (Paus  ), and more generally the presence of a strong structure-to-function relationship in this region (see also Wang et al.  ). In the study by Derrfuss et al. ( ), which again was carried out using an individual-level approach, 13 out of 14 subjects showed activations localized between the caudal bank of the IFS and the iPCS that corresponded to the anatomical description of the IFJ in a task-switching paradigm. Taken together, these studies point to the need to better characterize the relationship between sulcal morphology and functional specialization within the PFC. This research line may in the future allow predicting functional activity from neuroanatomical information alone, thus accomplishing one of the fundamental goals of contemporary cognitive neuroscience in terms of inferring structure-to-function relationships (Amiez et al.  ; Osher et al.  ; Passingham et al.  ; Saygin et al.  ). In summary, the organization of the regions localized along the banks of the major sulci of the posterior-lateral PFC, namely the SFS, the sPCS, the iPCS, and the IFS, has yet to be clarified spatially. \n\nIn this study, we aimed to accurately localize the FEF and IFJ based on standard fMRI localizer tasks. In particular, we wanted to reassess the precise localization of the FEF in standard space, and its relationship with the localization of the iFEF as inferred using saccadic functional localizers in the light of recent fMRI evidence (see Grosbras et al.  , Jamadar et al.  , and Paus  , for previous meta-analyses using fMRI and PET experiments). Further, we also wanted to re-examine the precise localization of the IFJ in standard space by inferring the convergence of activations across paradigms (Derrfuss et al.  ; Muhle-Karbe et al.  ). This information may provide important clues for better-interpreting activations in the posterior-lateral PFC based on combined structural and functional criteria. Coordinate-based meta-analyses offer a convenient way to summarize and model the uncertainty in the activations found across several PET/fMRI experiments (Fox et al.  ) based on specific paradigms and contrasts of interest, overcoming inter-individual variability, and allow to establish adequately powered brain-behavior relationship. Here, we employed the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analytic technique to accurately infer the localization of the FEF and IFJ activation peaks in standard space By using the inferred ALE peak coordinates as seeds, we also performed a meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) analysis (Langner and Camilleri  ) to investigate the coactivation profiles of FEF and IFJ in fMRI studies across paradigms in a data-driven fashion. Overall, the goal of our study\u00a0is to offer some consensus and anatomical priors to localize these regions with fMRI, and to guide future non-invasive brain stimulation studies. In addition, our study also aims to provide meta-analytic groundwork to investigate the relationship between the functional specialization and connectivity of the FEF and IFJ in large multimodal neuroimaging datasets (e.g., the Human Connectome Project; Van Essen et al.  ). \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Activation likelihood estimation fMRI meta-analysis method \n  \nThe ALE is a powerful meta-analytic technique that allows for assessing the spatial convergence of the activations reported in the neuroimaging literature (Eickhoff et al.  ). As a coordinate-based technique, ALE takes as input the activation peaks reported by several independent neuroimaging studies and tests their significance against a null distribution of the foci across the whole brain (Eickhoff et al.  ). This ALE feature is particularly useful given that in the neuroimaging literature results are usually reported and summarized as   x  ,   y  ,   z   coordinates in standard space (Talairach or MNI), rather than as full activation maps accompanied by a statistical summary of the effect sizes, and even more rarely shared in that form (for important initiatives in neuroimaging data sharing see, however, NeuroVault:  , Gorgolewski et al.  , and OpenNeuro:  , Markiewicz et al.  , among other initiatives). This aspect becomes crucial in the case of brain regions that may be under-reported in the fMRI literature (such as the iFEF; Derrfuss et al.  ; Kastner et al.  ) or which only recently began to be included in the brain atlases taxonomy (such as the IFJ; Bedini and Baldauf  ; Sundermann and Pfleiderer  ). Here, we exploited this ALE feature by applying this technique to analyze two independent collections of fMRI studies performed over the last 30\u00a0years with the primary aim of accurately inferring FEF and IFJ localization in MNI152 space using the GingerALE software (v. 3.0.2;  ). In the ALE procedure, each set of foci reported in a study is modeled as a three-dimensional Gaussian distribution centered around the coordinates and whose width is determined based on the experiment sample size (Eickhoff et al.  ). Larger sample sizes result in tighter Gaussians, which reflects lower uncertainty about the \u2018true\u2019 location reported, whereas lower samples lead to larger Gaussians that are more spread around the respective peak coordinates, thus conveniently reflecting lower confidence about their corresponding locations. These activations are then combined into a modeled activation map for each experiment of a study. Importantly, in the revised ALE algorithm, within-study effects that could result from the summation of adjacent foci are minimized, so that studies that reported activation in a higher number or more densely organized foci would not drive the ALE results disproportionately (Turkeltaub et al.  ). By computing the union of all these modeled activation maps, an ALE score for each voxel in the brain is obtained (Eickhoff et al.  ). The significance of these scores is then assessed by comparing them with the null distribution obtained by randomly reassigning the modeled activations across the whole brain with a permutation approach. Finally, the thresholded p-values are usually corrected for multiple comparisons using either voxel-level or cluster-level family-wise error (FWE). The use of uncorrected p-values and false discovery rate is instead generally not advised since it can lead to spurious findings (Eickhoff et al.  ). \n\nThe present meta-analysis focused on specific cognitive functions (described more in detail in the ' ') in which the FEF and IFJ and the associated brain networks are relatively well-known to be involved. More specifically, in what we will refer to in the following as the \u2018FEF sample\u2019, we applied the ALE technique to several independent fMRI studies requiring the planning and execution of visually guided and voluntary eye movements, as a considerable number of previous studies clearly showed that these types of tasks elicit activation in the FEF, and other eye fields (for previous meta-analyses see Cieslik et al.  ; Grosbras et al.  ; Jamadar et al.  ; Paus  ). In particular, tasks requiring the execution of prosaccades and antisaccades contrasted against a fixation baseline are the most prevalent and consensually established FEF functional localizer in the human fMRI literature (Amiez et al.  ; Amiez and Petrides  ; Kastner et al.  ). In the case of the \u2018IFJ sample\u2019, it is arguably more difficult to pinpoint a widely employed functional localizer for this region, We, therefore, anticipate that in this sample we analyzed data from a more heterogeneous collection of fMRI studies investigating covert attention, working memory, and cognitive control across a wider range of paradigms. \n\n\n### Study selection criteria \n  \nThe selection criteria of the sample of studies for the present meta-analysis followed the best-practice recommendations and guidelines by M\u00fcller et al. ( ). Multiple bibliographic searches were performed between May 2019 and January 2021 (cutoff date). A final search was conducted with the same criteria and cutoff dates (i.e., January 1, 1990\u2013January 1, 2021) by the first author MB to comply with the updated PRISMA guidelines (Page et al.  ) and as a sanity check. The selection procedure is reported in Figures S1 and S2 (created based on the PRISMA flow diagram; Page et al.  ), which refer to the \u2018FEF sample\u2019 and the \u2018IFJ sample\u2019, respectively. All the bibliographical searches were carried out using the Web of Science ( ). We searched records in the Web of Science Core Collection using the keywords \u2018fMRI\u2019 AND \u2018frontal eye field\u2019 (all fields) in the first instance, and \u2018fMRI\u2019 AND \u2018inferior frontal junction\u2019 (all fields) in the second. We complemented these results with other sources (Google Scholar, personal collection of articles and references cited by the studies retrieved) by one of the authors (MB). In the FEF sample, our search identified a total of 711 records, from which we removed all the review papers. 665 records were further screened, and 470 of these were sought for retrieval to assess their adequacy with respect to the inclusion criteria (described below). In the IFJ sample, 375 results were identified, from which, after removing the\u00a0review papers, 356 records were further screened, and 142 of these were sought for retrieval to assess their adequacy with respect to our inclusion criteria. The general inclusion criteria consisted of the following. Each study selected: 1. Reported coordinates in standard space (either MNI or Talairach); 2. Was an fMRI study (we decided to not include PET studies as our goal was to keep our samples as homogeneous as possible in terms of the signal measured, the spatial resolution and analysis pipelines (Botvinik-Nezer et al.  ) to make our results specific to the fMRI field); 3. Performed on a scanner of 3\u00a0T or higher field; 4. Tested and reported results from healthy adults (18\u201360\u00a0years old; or an appropriate control group in the case of clinical studies); 5. The study acquired whole-brain fMRI data or with a FOV that was sufficiently large to cover the posterior frontal lobe (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 for the FOV of each study). The last group of inclusion criteria is specific to each sample (the FEF or the IFJ) and is primarily related to the type of experimental paradigm utilized in the fMRI study and the specific contrasts analyzed. Here, we strived to find a balance that would adequately represent the various localization methods that have been pursued in the fMRI literature, while also assigning a higher weight in the sample to the more standardized and replicated localization approaches. \n\n\n### FEF sample inclusion criteria \n  \nThe human FEF is a well-characterized region in the fMRI literature (Bedini and Baldauf  ), although some uncertainties persist regarding the correspondence of its localization obtained from fMRI compared with other methods (i.e., brain stimulation; Vernet et al.  ) and with the macaque FEF (Koyama et al.  ; Petit and Pouget  ). The region is crucially involved in the top-down control of eye movements and spatial attention (Astafiev et al.  ; Beauchamp et al.  ; Corbetta et al.  ; de Haan et al.  ), and it is considered a prominent node of the dorsal attention network (Corbetta and Shulman  ; Fox et al.  ; Yeo et al.  ). A very simple and time-efficient yet effective way to localize the FEF with\u00a0fMRI is to have participants perform an experimental block of visually guided saccades toward an unpredictable peripheral target and contrast this activation with a fixation block (Amiez et al.  ). The resulting activations\u2014usually found near the junction of the SFS and the sPCS\u2014are then assumed to correspond to the FEF (Paus  ). However, depending on the statistical thresholds and analytical approach adopted, in addition to this superior cluster, often this type of contrast reveals a more widespread pattern of activity along the banks of the iPCS (Beauchamp et al.  ; Kastner et al.  ; Luna et al.  ). Therefore, this localization method does not seem to have adequate functional specificity if not combined with the additional anatomical criteria mentioned above. Building on this approach, the antisaccade task and its neural mechanisms have been extensively studied in the non-human primate neurophysiology literature (Munoz and Everling  ), and this task has been employed as a measure of inhibitory control in healthy and clinical populations in humans (Hutton and Ettinger  ). Briefly, in the antisaccade task, the subject is required to keep fixation until a visual target appears and to look at its mirror location. Computationally, this requires at least two mechanisms: the first one inhibits a reflexive saccade towards the visual onset, and the second is responsible for executing a saccade towards the opposite location (the endpoint is in this case endogenously generated; Munoz and Everling  ). fMRI studies comparing the regions involved in prosaccades vs antisaccades have found overlapping activations in the FEF, although the antisaccade task recruits additional regions that seem to reflect the greater executive demands of this task (McDowell et al.  ). Within FEF, there is also increased activity in the antisaccade compared to the prosaccade task, which is particularly evident during the preparatory phase (Curtis and Connolly  ; DeSouza et al. 2003: Fernandez-Ruiz et al. 2018; Jarvstad and Gilchrist 2019). Based on these results, it could be hypothesized that contrasting antisaccade vs and prosaccade trials may offer better specificity to localize clusters of activity within the FEF compared to the prosaccade vs fixation blocked design described earlier. Previous studies did not address this hypothesis directly, and it still needs to be tested in a within-subject design by examining the activation topographies at the individual subject level. Finally, in modified versions of the spatial cueing paradigm (e.g., Fan et al.  ), univariate analyses contrasting valid vs neutral/invalid trials are often used to localize all the main regions belonging to the dorsal attention network, which are subsequently used as ROIs for functional and effective connectivity analyses (for examples see Vossel et al.  , and Wen et al.  ). It can be argued that, even though these adaptations are not generally employed as independent functional localizers for the FEF, they may be well adept at isolating this region under the assumption that covert and overt shifts of spatial attention have a shared and overlapping source in this region, which seems well supported by fMRI (Astafiev et al.  ; Beauchamp et al.  ; Corbetta et al.  ; de Haan et al.  ; Jerde et al.  ) and comparative evidence (Buschman and Miller  ; Moore and Fallah  ; reviewed in Fiebelkorn and Kastner  ). Indeed, the studies that directly investigated this question generally reported a strong degree of spatial overlap, although they also suggest that the signal measured in covert paradigms tends to be weaker than in overt tasks (Beauchamp et al.  ; de Haan et al.  ) and thus possibly less robust across fMRI data analysis pipelines (Botvinik-Nezer et al.  ). Thus, an open question is whether oculomotor and covert spatial attention tasks are equally efficient in localizing the FEF. \n\nIn summary, for the reasons introduced above, we included in the FEF sample all the studies that investigated the planning and execution of visually guided and voluntary eye movements (prosaccades and antisaccades) as well as covert spatial attention using both blocked and event-related designs (see Figure S1 for an overview of the selection procedure following the PRISMA2020 guidelines; Page et al.  ), analyzing mainly the following contrasts: 1. prosaccades\u2009>\u2009fixation; 2. antisaccades\u2009>\u2009fixation; 3. prosaccades & antisaccades\u2009>\u2009fixation; 4. antisaccades\u2009>\u2009prosaccades; 5. valid\u2009>\u2009neutral/invalid trials. Combining these contrasts allowed us to carry out our main analysis complemented by three control analyses, respectively, designed to replicate a previous study (Cieslik et al.  ) and to investigate two additional research questions (see Supplementary Information p. 8). In our main localizer analysis, we pooled together all studies that reported at least a contrast related to the planning and execution of prosaccades and antisaccades contrasted with a fixation baseline. \n\n\n### IFJ sample inclusion criteria \n  \nIn contrast to the FEF, the IFJ does not have a well-established homolog in the macaque (Bedini and Baldauf  ; see, however, Bichot et al.  ,  , and Neubert et al.  ) and its role started to be investigated only much more recently with fMRI (Brass et al.  ). Its functional profile remains to date not well understood and is characterized by a remarkable functional heterogeneity (Muhle-Karbe et al.  ; Ngo et al.  ). Consistent with this idea, recent high-resolution fMRI studies showed that the IFJ (and in particular, the posterior IFJ as defined according to the MMP1 by Glasser et al.  ) belongs to the core multiple-demand system of the brain (Assem et al.  ), which identifies a set of regions that are engaged in multiple processes often across different cognitive domains (Duncan  ). This particular position in the cognitive processing architecture arguably poses a severe challenge in trying to define a gold standard for an fMRI localization method for this region, which would allow for effectively segregating it from adjacent coactive regions. Several promising approaches to localize the IFJ at the individual level have nevertheless previously been reported from different research groups ranging from attention and working memory to cognitive control paradigms (Baldauf and Desimone  ; Derrfuss et al.  ; Zanto et al.  ). The studies led by Brass, Derrfuss and colleagues were critical in establishing the IFJ as a region involved in task preparation and more generally in cognitive control (reviewed in Brass et al.  ). In more recent studies, these processes are reflected in the distinct components of executive functions, such as updating and shifting the task set, which consistently recruit this region (Nee et al.  ; Rodr\u00edguez-Nieto et al.  ; Worringer et al.  ). \n\nBased on the evidence introduced above, in the IFJ sample, we decided to include attentional (i.e., rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) and endogenous cueing paradigms), working memory (primarily n-back paradigms; Rottschy et al.  ), and cognitive control paradigms (i.e., task-switching and Stroop tasks; Worringer et al.  ; see Figure S2 for an overview of the selection procedure following the PRISMA2020 guidelines; Page et al.  ). These inclusion criteria were based on Derrfuss et al. ( ), who investigated switching and Stroop paradigms, and we extended them to attentional and working memory paradigms that also tap cognitive control. The main contrasts analyzed were, therefore, quite heterogeneous, but can be broadly grouped into the following primary ones: 1. Oddball\u2009>\u2009Target trials in covert attention paradigms (e.g., RSVP paradigms); 2. Functional connectivity with a seed perceptual region (e.g., V4, V5, FFA) in the Attend\u2009>\u2009Ignore condition in n-back paradigms; 3. Switching\u2009>\u2009Repetition trials in task-switching paradigms; 4. Incongruent\u2009>\u2009Congruent trials in Stroop paradigms. We carried out exploratory ALE contrast analyses to examine potential spatial discrepancies between the IFJ peaks derived from splitting up the localizer sample according to the main cognitive function investigated (see Supplementary Information p. 9 and 20\u201322). \n\nIn conclusion, the final sample of the included papers for our ALE meta-analysis was   n  \u2009=\u200951 for the FEF, and   n  \u2009=\u200930 for the IFJ sample (see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Information for a summary of the studies, respectively). The number of experiments was 35 for the FEF localizer sample, and 32 for the IFJ localizer sample. Both sample sizes were within the recommended range (i.e., a minimum of 20 experiments) to have adequate statistical power with ALE as derived from empirical simulations (Eickhoff et al.  ). \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation procedure \n  \nAll the foci from the experiments included were mapped from Talairach to the MNI152 space using the function provided by GingerALE (v. 3.0.2; Eickhoff et al.  ; Lancaster et al.  ; see Supplementary Information p. 8 for details about this step). \n\nFor the main localizer analyses (FEF and IFJ localizer samples), the ALE parameters were set to 5000 threshold permutations and a voxel-level FWE of 0.01 was applied (Eickhoff et al.  ) with a minimum cluster size of 50\u00a0mm  (corresponding to 6 voxels). Compared to cluster-level FWE inference, which can only allow inferring that a given cluster is above a significance threshold as a whole, but critically, not that any putative region that is included in the cluster is individually significant on its own, voxel-level FWE allows to more readily interpret all the cluster extent as well as its peak location from the main localizer samples anatomically (Eickhoff et al.  ). Moreover, our sample sizes ensured that these clusters would not be driven by a contribution exceeding 50% of any individual study (Eickhoff et al.  ), therefore allowing us to interpret individual voxel ALE values as a proxy for the most active location across experiments. When retrieving the relevant foci, we first grouped the studies by a subject group rather than by experiment. This was done because grouping by subject group further minimizes within-study effects (Turkeltaub et al.  ). When a single experiment reported multiple contrasts of interest, we, therefore, pooled them under the same subject group. We note that however, in all cases in which the studies reported more than one contrast of interest they were drawn from the same experiment (with very few exceptions; see Tables S1 and S2), so our strategy did not unfairly pool together partially independent observations and was practically almost equivalent to grouping by experiment. When an experiment failed to report significant activation for some ROIs, we used the lower number of subjects that had above threshold activations in all ROIs from a contrast of interest if this information was available. To validate the results of the main ALE analyses and to further assess the reliability of the ALE peaks found, we also carried out a leave-one-experiment-out procedure (LOEO; Eickhoff et al.  ) on the main FEF and IFJ localizer samples using the same foci grouping strategy. Since we found identical ALE peaks as in the main ALE analyses using 1000 threshold permutations, we performed the LOEO procedure with the same parameter to reduce computational times. \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation control analyses \n  \nWe carried out two control analyses in the FEF and IFJ localizer samples to rule out potential biases in our main ALE results. As we were mainly interested in inferring the localization of the FEF and IFJ, we decided to include studies with partial brain coverage. We motivated this choice by accepting the tradeoff between having access to a larger sample of experiments for these regions, as opposed to having less sensitivity in detecting other regions that are consistently active during the tasks included (which, however, are not the main focus of the present study), but not reported simply due to the lack of whole-brain brain coverage. The inclusion of studies with partial brain coverage is, however, generally not recommended in ALE analyses (M\u00fcller et al.  ). In our first set of control analyses, we have, therefore, excluded those studies based on the FOV parameters reported in the study (see Tables S1 and S2) or the author\u2019s description of the fMRI data acquisition. This led to the exclusion of two experiments from the FEF sample (Amiez and Petrides  , and Berman et al.  ), and one study in the IFJ sample (Sreenivasan et al.  ). For this control analysis, the ALE parameters were set to 5000 threshold permutations and a voxel-level FWE of 0.01 with a minimum cluster size of 50mm . The second set of control analyses was carried out to rule out another potential source of biases, namely ROI analyses (M\u00fcller et al.  ). These analyses imply restricting the assessment of statistical significance by some form of spatial masking. In this case, we excluded all the studies that either carried out ROI analyses or that only reported their results for specific ROIs (or even only FEF and IFJ foci; see Tables S1 and S2). This led to an important decrease in both the FEF and IFJ localizer sample sizes (to 16 and 22 eligible experiments, respectively). The ALE parameters were set to 5000 threshold permutations and a voxel-level FWE of 0.01 with a minimum cluster size of 50\u00a0mm , as in our main localizer analyses. \n\n\n### Comparison method of the ALE clusters and peaks with previous coordinate-based meta-analyses, relationship to macro-anatomical information and the MMP1 \n  \nTo interpret our results more carefully, we compared the clusters obtained from our ALE main localizer analyses with the results from previous meta-analyses results and brain atlases (Derrfuss et al.  ; Glasser et al.  ; Klein and Tourville  ; Paus  ). First, we described the anatomical location of each cluster and assigned the corresponding BA using the Talairach Daemon in GingerALE (Lancaster et al.  ). Second, to compare our results with previous meta-analyses (Derrfuss et al.  ; Paus  ), we mapped our ALE peaks to the Talairach space using the transformation developed by Lancaster et al. ( ) with GingerALE (MNI (FSL) to Talairach; see Table  ). Third, to relate our results to surface-based atlases (Klein and Tourville  ; Glasser et al.  ), we followed two distinct approaches. The Mindboggle 101 atlas (Klein and Tourville  ) describes the macro-anatomical organization of the human brain as delineated by sulcal and gyral information. The atlas was recently mapped to the MNI152 non-linear symmetric template (Manera et al.  ), thus we manually imported this atlas in FSL and in FSLeyes as described in this GitHub repository:  . We assigned one of the Mindboggle 101 labels to each of the ALE peak coordinates using the atlasquery command-line tool with FSL (v. 6.0.3; Jenkinson et al.  ). For atlases that were released and best interpreted in a surface format, such as the MMP1 (Glasser et al.  ; see Coalson et al.   for an in-depth discussion), we instead employed the mapping technique developed in Wu et al. ( ) to register our ALE results from the MNI152 space to FSaverage (Fischl et al.  ). A version of the MMP1 mapped to the FSaverage surface was made available using the method described in Mills ( ;  ). Once we mapped the ALE clusters to this surface, we also mapped the MNI152 coordinates corresponding to each ALE peak to a vertex on the inflated surface and we assigned each of these to the respective MMP1 labels (Table  ). To describe the anatomical labels associated with each ALE cluster using more specific labels (compared to the Talairach Daemon), we used a volumetric version of this atlas for convenience. The source files that were used to import the atlas are the same as in Huang et al. ( ). The volumetric version of the MMP1 was manually imported in FSLeyes as described in this GitHub repository:  . \n\n\n### Meta-analytic connectivity modeling method \n  \nWe exploited the ALE peaks obtained from the main localizer analyses to perform a data-driven analysis of the coactivation patterns of the FEF and the IFJ across the whole brain to uncover their task-based fMRI functional connectivity fingerprint (Langner and Camilleri  ). We, therefore, retrieved all the papers matching specific criteria (described below) from the BrainMap database using Sleuth ( ; Fox and Lancaster  ), and we analyzed these foci by employing the MACM technique (Langner and Camilleri  ). This technique leverages the ALE algorithm and allows inferring all the regions that coactivate with a given seed region that is selected a priori. This analysis also allowed us to perform a reverse inference on these coactivation patterns (Poldrack  ). More specifically, we sought to functionally decode and characterize the various behavioral domains that are significantly associated with each of these using a standardized taxonomy (Fox et al.  ) via the Mango software (v. 4.1) behavioral analysis plugin (v. 3.1; Lancaster et al.  ). \n\nThe studies were retrieved from the BrainMap database using Sleuth according to the following fields (all linked using the \u2018AND\u2019 operator): in the Experiment field, the \u201ccontext\u201d field was set to \u201cnormal mapping\u201d, in the \u201cactivation\u201d field we searched for \u201cactivations only\u201d, with \u201cImaging modality\u201d being set to \u201cfMRI\u201d. Finally, four separate searches were conducted in the BrainMap database by setting the \u201clocations\u201d field as corresponding to each left hemisphere (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) seed region (LH FEF, RH FEF, LH IFJ, and RH IFJ). We first transformed each seed location from MNI152 to Talairach space (which is the standard in Sleuth and also used internally by Mango\u2019s behavioral plugin) using the transformation by Lancaster et al. ( ; the FSL transformation) and we created cuboid seeds of 6\u00a0mm centered around the respective ALE peaks. With these criteria, we were able to retrieve a range of 19 to 53 studies across seed locations. We retrieved 26 studies (27 experiments) for the LH FEF seed, 19 studies (19 experiments) for the RH FEF seed, 53 studies (59 experiments) for the LH IFJ, and 31 studies (31 experiments) for the RH IFJ. We note that the different number of studies retrieved possibly reflects a combination of the increased base probability of finding activations within a specific ROI (Langner et al.  ) but also the fact that some ROIs tend to participate in multiple functional networks (Langner and Camilleri  ), which seems to fit well with the role of the IFJ in the frontoparietal network (Cole et al.  ). Crucially, these sample sizes allowed for adequately powered inference using ALE (Eickhoff et al.  ). Therefore, we used all the foci retrieved separately from each seed location as inputs for GingerALE. The ALE parameters were set to an 0.001 uncorrected   p   value, 1000 threshold permutations, and a cluster-level FWE of   p  \u2009<\u20090.01. In the functional decoding analysis, we used the same 6\u00a0mm cuboid seeds as in the MACM analysis centered around the respective FEF and IFJ ALE peaks. Associations with behavioral domains were considered statistically significant when their   z   score was\u2009\u2265\u20093, corresponding to a threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (Bonferroni corrected). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### FEF and IFJ localizer samples ALE main clusters \n  \nIn the FEF localizer sample, the activations converged most strongly in two main clusters localized in the left and right posterior dorsolateral PFC. Two ALE peaks were found near the junction of the sPCS with the SFS, localized in the anterior (in the LH) and posterior (in the RH) banks of the sPCS (Fig.\u00a0 ). These peaks match well the classical description of the human FEF as inferred with fMRI (Petit and Pouget  ; Vernet et al.  ). Our LOEO procedure overall confirms the reliability of the localization of these ALE peaks (see Table  ; LH: 26/35; RH: 23/35). In the IFJ localizer sample, the activations converged most\u00a0strongly in two main clusters localized in the left and right posterior ventrolateral PFC. These clusters extended both in the dorsal and ventral portion of the iPCS, partially encroaching on the IFS (see Fig.\u00a0 ). The cluster in the right hemisphere was slightly smaller and spatially more focused compared to the cluster in the left hemisphere. Crucially, in both clusters, we found that the ALE peaks were localized along the posterior bank of the iPCS, near its ventral junction with the IFS, which closely matches the description of the IFJ (Derrfuss et al.  ; Muhle-Karbe et al.  ). Again, our LOEO procedure overall suggests that these ALE peaks are highly reliable across experiments (see Table  ; LH: 31/32; RH: 24/32).   \nFEF and IFJ localizer samples\u2014ALE main clusters.   A   ALE results from the FEF localizer sample. Two main clusters were found in the posterior dorsolateral PFC, which corresponds to the description of the anatomical location of the FEF (Paus  ; Vernet et al.  ). The FEF peaks were localized at the junction of the sPCS and the SFS, in the anterior (in the LH) and posterior (in the RH) banks of the sPCS.   B   ALE results from the IFJ localizer sample. Two main clusters were found in the posterior ventrolateral PFC, and their respective peaks were localized along the posterior bank of the iPCS, near its ventral junction with the IFS. The location of these peaks and the corresponding MNI152 coordinates match the description of the IFJ (Derrfuss et al.  ; Muhle-Karbe et al.  ) \n  \n\n\n### FEF localizer sample ALE results\u2014FEF lateral peak and other significant clusters \n  \nIn the left hemisphere, we also found a lateral peak within the main FEF cluster, which was localized on the bank of the iPCS, dorsal to its junction with the IFS (see Fig.\u00a0 ). This lateral peak corresponds to what has been previously referred to as the inferior or the lateral FEF (Derrfuss et al.  ; Kastner et al.  ; Luna et al.  ). In addition to the main FEF clusters in the left/right PFC, the ALE technique revealed three other consistently activated clusters. These clusters were localized in the medial frontal gyrus and the left/right posterior parietal cortex (Table  ). The cluster in the medial frontal gyrus comprised the SCEF (Amiez and Petrides  ) and the dorsal cingulate motor cortex (Glasser et al.  ). In the posterior parietal cortex, two bilateral superior clusters spanned the precuneus and the SPL (Scheperjans et al.  ,  ), and an additional cluster was found in the right anterior intraparietal area (Glasser et al.  ; Numssen et al.  ).   \nFEF localizer sample ALE results\u2014FEF lateral peak and other significant clusters. In the FEF localizer analysis, we also found a lateral peak in the LH, which was localized near the bank of the iPCS, dorsal to its junction with the IFS, corresponding to the iFEF (Derrfuss et al.  ; Kastner et al.  ). It is unclear whether this region should be considered part of the FEF proper (Glasser et al.  ; Mackey et al.  ). We found three other significant clusters localized in the supplementary and cingulate eye field (SCEF) and the dorsal cingulate motor cortex, and the precuneus/superior parietal lobule (SPL) and the right anterior intraparietal area. These areas form some of the core control structures of the oculomotor network (Coiner et al.  ) \n    \nFEF localizer sample ALE results \n  \n\n\n### IFJ localizer sample ALE results\u2014other significant clusters \n  \nIn addition to the main IFJ clusters in the left/right PFC, we found seven consistently activated clusters forming a broad frontoparietal network (see Fig.\u00a0 ). In the frontal cortex, the first cluster was localized in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and SCEF (Amiez and Petrides  ; Glasser et al.  ), a second in the left precentral gyrus (within the putative FEF), and finally, two other clusters were localized in the bilateral insular cortex and claustrum (Table  ). Posteriorly, we also found a cluster in the left SPL/inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and a smaller cluster in the right SPL/IPL (Numssen et al.  ; Scheperjans et al.  ,  ).   \nIFJ localizer sample ALE results\u2014Other significant clusters. In addition to the bilateral IFJ clusters, we found significant activations in the dACC/SCEF, the left FEF, in two clusters in the insular cortex and claustrum (not visible in the\u00a0LH), and finally, in the SPL/IPL. Given that these areas were activated across different paradigms, we suggest that they could be associated with the \u201cencoding and updating of task-relevant representations\u201d as first hypothesized by Derrfuss et al. ( ; see also Rodr\u00edguez-Nieto et al.  ). These areas mostly belong to the frontoparietal network (Yeo et al.  ) \n    \nIFJ localizer sample ALE results \n  \nNA = Not Available \n  \n\n\n### Control analyses ALE results \n  \nThe results of the control analysis excluding studies with partial brain coverage replicated our main localizer results, both in terms of the inferred ALE peaks and of the number and anatomical localization of the significant clusters. In the FEF sample, the ALE peaks coincided with the main analysis, and the only difference that emerged was a minor shift of the left iFEF peak (from MNI152:\u2009\u2212\u200948,\u2009\u2212\u20092, 40 to\u2009\u2212\u200946,\u2009\u2212\u20092, 38). In the IFJ sample, the ALE peaks again coincided with the results of our main analysis. The results of the second control analysis where we excluded all ROI analyses again matched well with our main results in terms of the inferred ALE peaks but had important differences regarding the number and anatomical localization of the significant clusters. The results of this control analysis are reported in the Supplementary Information (see Tables S6 and S7 for the FEF and IFJ samples, respectively). In the FEF sample, the cluster with the highest ALE value was now localized primarily in the left medial frontal gyrus, including the SCEF. The second and third larger clusters were, however, again localized in the left and right FEF, respectively, and were of the same size approximately. The inferred FEF ALE peaks were almost identical to our main results (LH main:\u2009\u2212\u200928,\u2009\u2212\u20096, 54 vs no ROI control:\u2009\u2212\u200928,\u2009\u2212\u20096, 56; and RH main: 30,\u2009\u2212\u20096, 50 vs no ROI control: 28,\u2009\u2212\u20096, 50; all the coordinates are in MNI152 space). However, in contrast to our main analysis results, the left FEF cluster did not spread onto the iPCS and there was not any peak corresponding to the iFEF. Interestingly, we also found a second peak in the right FEF cluster, which was lateral relative to the first, although still localized within the sPCS (40,\u2009\u2212\u20094, 50). In the IFJ sample, the most prominent\u00a0clusters were localized in the left and right IFJ, replicating our main analysis results. Their ALE peak exactly matched those from our main results in the left hemisphere (\u2212\u200942, 6, 30) but had some slight differences in the right hemispheres, where we found two peaks with similar ALE values (main: 46, 12, 28 vs no ROI control: 46, 10, 26, and 42, 8, 30). This indicates some residual variability in the localization of the right IFJ, which was not detectable in our main analysis results. \n\n\n### Spatial relationship of the main FEF and IFJ ALE\u00a0clusters and peaks with previous coordinate-based meta-analyses, macro-anatomical information and the MMP1 \n  \nThe comparison of the FEF and IFJ ALE peaks from the localizer samples analyses overall shows good spatial correspondence with results from previous meta-analyses and the MMP1, but with some important differences that are worth examining in detail (see Table  ). The FEF ALE peaks from our results are localized much more medially and posteriorly relative to the results reported in Paus ( ), highlighting marked spatial differences with this landmark FEF meta-analysis. In contrast, the IFJ ALE peaks are virtually identical to those reported in the study by Derrfuss et al. ( ; with slightly less agreement in the RH), where the authors also employed the ALE technique in one of its earlier implementations. Macro-anatomically, according to the Mindboggle 101 atlas (Klein and Tourville  ; Manera et al.  ), the LH FEF and RH FEF peaks lie within the caudal middle frontal gyrus (in BA 6) and not in the precentral gyrus, as previously assumed based on non-human primate evidence (Bruce et al  ; Schall et al.  , and Tehovnik et al.  , for reviews). These results are consistent with the few pieces of evidence available on the delineation of this region based on cytoarchitecture in   post-mortem   studies (Rosano et al.  ; Schmitt et al.  ). While the left IFJ ALE peak was found in the precentral gyrus (in BA 6), interestingly the right IFJ ALE peak was instead localized within the pars opercularis (in BA 9). The distinctive architecture of the IFJ remains elusive, but these peaks agree with the evidence that this area is localized in several Brodmann areas (BA6, 8, 9, 44 and 45), and may correspond to a specific cyto- and chemo-architecture found dorsal to BA44 (Amunts and Von Cramon 2006; for a recent fine-grained analysis of its architecture see Ruland et al.  ).   \nComparison of the ALE peaks with previous meta-analyses and brain atlases \n  \n\nFinally, in our opinion, the most interesting results of these comparisons were those obtained from the projection of our main FEF and IFJ clusters on the FSaverage surface using the method from Wu et al. ( ) where we could carefully examine their spatial relationship with the MMP1 (see Fig.\u00a0 ). The FEF clusters covered almost the entire middle and anterior part of the FEF (as defined by the corresponding MMP1 label) but also large parts of the middle and posterior 6a region. Moreover, the left and right hemisphere ALE peaks were found within area i6-8 and area 6a, anteriorly and dorsally relative to the FEF, respectively. The IFJ clusters instead spanned multiple MMP1 labels, including areas PEF, 6r, IFJp and IFJa. While in the left hemisphere, the majority of the vertices of the cluster were localized in the middle and posterior aspect of the IFJp, in the right hemisphere most of the vertices were localized in the ventral 6r region. Crucially, in both hemispheres, however, the ALE peaks were localized in the latter region, ventral to the IFJp.   \nProjection on FSaverage of the FEF and IFJ main clusters and comparison with the MMP1.   A   Vertices corresponding to the FEF clusters. Both clusters covered the middle and rostral parts of the FEF label as defined according to the MMP1 atlas, but they also covered large parts of area 6a. In the LH, vertices were also localized in the iFEF, which matches almost exactly the boundaries of area PEF from the atlas. The LH FEF ALE\u00a0peak was localized within area i6-8, just anterior to the FEF, and the RH FEF ALE\u00a0peak was localized within area 6a, dorsal to FEF. Despite this difference, both peaks were localized near the junction of the sPCS and the SFS, in the anterior bank and the posterior banks of the sPCS, respectively.   B   Vertices corresponding to the IFJ clusters. They showed a similar elongated shape that approximately followed the posterior iPCS and encroached onto the IFS, and they spanned multiple MMP1 areas. Importantly, we found that in both hemispheres the IFJ ALE\u00a0peaks were localized near the junction of the iPCS and the SFS within area 6r, posteriorly to the IFJp \n  \n\n\n### Meta-analytic connectivity modeling results \n  \nThe MACM analysis of the FEF and IFJ revealed a broad set of regions that coactivated with these seeds in the BrainMap database encompassing the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices (see Fig.\u00a0 ). The LH FEF seed coactivated with six other clusters (see Fig.\u00a0 A), and the RH FEF coactivated with eight other clusters (Fig.\u00a0 B). Interestingly, while these FEF coactivations included as expected medial oculomotor regions (the SCEF) and the SPL/IPL, in both analyses we found coactivated clusters in the bilateral ventral PFC, which included parts of the iFEF and the IFJ based on their localization relative to the iPCS and the IFS. The LH IFJ coactivated with a broad set of other nine clusters (Fig.\u00a0 C), and the RH IFJ coactivated with five other clusters (Fig.\u00a0 D). The coactivations of these bilateral seeds spread onto the IFS and ventrally in the insular cortex and claustrum. Again, these coactivations included clusters in the SCEF, the SPL/IPL and the angular gyrus. In contrast to the FEF coactivations, where the bilateral IFJ was always coactivated, we did not find FEF coactivations in the IFJ MACM results, except for the ipsilateral FEF in the LH IFJ MACM analysis. Another crucial difference was that in this analysis, we found a large cluster in the left temporal lobe that included the fusiform gyrus and the inferior occipital cortex. We confirmed these patterns by performing an ALE contrast analysis between the FEF and IFJ MACM results in each hemisphere (see Supplementary Information p. 23). To summarize, while the FEF MACM analysis showed that this region is consistently coactivated with the ventrolateral PFC and regions in the posterior parietal cortex across paradigms, the IFJ had more widespread coactivation patterns (particularly in the LH), being more strongly connected with the rest of the PFC and with the insular cortex and claustrum, and possessing a differential connectivity pattern with regions of the inferior temporal cortex. In contrast, we found differential coactivations of the LH and RH FEF with the ipsilateral precuneus/SPL and lateral intraparietal areas. In addition to revealing the task-based functional connectivity fingerprint of these regions, our functional decoding approach also allowed us to uncover the behavioral domains significantly associated with each of them (Fig.\u00a0 , right side of each panel; see Supplementary Information p. 23 for a summary of these results).   \nMeta-analytic connectivity modeling results.   A   and   B   depict the coactivation profiles of the FEF, and   C   and   D   depict the coactivation profiles of the IFJ. On the right side of each panel: decoding results of the significant associations with behavioral domains (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, Bonferroni corrected) \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe PFC is essential to several aspects of flexible goal-driven behavior that are mediated by specialized brain regions (Fuster  ; Miller and Cohen  ; O\u2019Reilly  ). The FEF and the IFJ have been primarily implicated in covert spatial attention and oculomotor control on the one hand (Fiebelkorn and Kastner  ; Vernet et al.  ), and attention, working memory, and cognitive control on the other (Bedini and Baldauf  ; Brass et al.  ). Their localization has been traditionally associated with the major sulci of the posterior-lateral PFC, namely the SFS and the sPCS, and the iPCS and the IFS, respectively (Amiez et al.  ; Derrfuss et al.  ). Due to the large body of empirical work that has accumulated over the past years on these regions (Bedini and Baldauf  ) and the parallel development of more robust meta-analytic techniques for neuroimaging data (Fox et al.  ), we felt the need to re-examine the previous results in light of the current evidence, with a specific focus on overcoming discrepancies in the definition and localization of these regions using fMRI in humans. In particular, in this study, we sought to accurately estimate the precise localization of these regions in standard space by performing a coordinate-based meta-analysis using the ALE technique (Eickhoff et al.  ). To model the spatial convergence of activations within the FEF, we analyzed data from 35 fMRI studies (35 experiments) that investigated the planning and execution of prosaccades and antisaccades contrasted against a fixation baseline in 449\u00a0subjects. To model the spatial convergence within the IFJ, we analyzed data from 30 fMRI studies (32 experiments) that investigated visual attention, working memory, and cognitive control, in 563\u00a0subjects. In contrast to previous ALE meta-analyses that relied on the false discovery rate (Derrfuss et al.  ; Grosbras et al.  ; Jamadar et al.  ), our study implemented a much more conservative method for multiple comparisons correction, namely voxel-level FWE, following the recommendations of Eickhoff et al. ( ). We also included only higher field fMRI studies (3\u00a0T and 4\u00a0T) to make our inference spatially more reliable. Moreover, testing for significance in each voxel individually enabled us to carry out a fine-grained assessment of activations across experiments. Crucially, we found that by modeling activity across studies (thus partially overcoming inter-individual variability), sulcal landmarks are indeed consistently associated with both regions, as indicated by the location of the ALE peak values (see Fig.\u00a0  and Table  ). Our results thus suggest a robust association of structure and function in these higher PFC regions (Frost and Goebel  ; Miller et al.  ; Van Essen  ; Wang et al.  ), analogous to what previous studies have shown in early visual regions (Benson et al.  ; Hinds et al.  ). We suggest that this association should be examined by future fMRI studies more systematically at the individual-subject level (Amiez et al.  ; Amiez and Petrides  ; Derrfuss et al.  ,  ). Given the limitations of previous meta-analyses (Derrfuss et al.  ; Grosbras et al.  ; Jamadar et al.  ; Paus  ), we recommend using the coordinates reported in the present study to define the FEF and IFJ based on the ALE technique. \n\n### FEF localization in standard space \n  \nThe FEF is arguably one of the most important regions of a network involved in the planning and execution of saccadic eye movements and has been extensively studied in primates (Schall et al.  ; Tehovnik et al.  ). In humans, this network comprises a set of regions in the lateral and medial frontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and subcortical nuclei (Corbetta et al.  ; Grosbras et al.  ), and has been mainly investigated with fMRI over the past 25\u00a0years, enabling to characterize their respective functions (Coiner et al.  ; McDowell et al.  ). Following the crucial foundation set by non-human primate neurophysiology (Bruce et al.  ; Buschman and Miller  ; Moore and Fallah  ), the human FEF has not only been implicated in visually guided and voluntary saccades, and other oculomotor behaviors (Vernet et al.  ), but also in covert shifts of spatial attention, spatial working memory, and also more complex executive functions (Fiebelkorn and Kastner  ; Vernet et al.  ). Converging lines of research suggest that the FEF acts as a spatial priority map (Fiebelkorn and Kastner  ; Jerde et al.  ; Sprague and Serences  ). The localization of the human FEF is, however, highly debated and affected by strong spatial variability (Bedini and Baldauf  ; Vernet et al.  ), possibly due to inter-individual differences that are obscured when reporting group-level results. Previous ALE meta-analyses provided evidence of consistent activations within FEF across PET and fMRI experiments investigating prosaccades and antisaccades (Cieslik et al.  ; Grosbras et al.  ; Jamadar et al.  ). However, given the coarser spatial resolution of PET and low-field strength MRI scanners (i.e., 1.5\u00a0T) and acquisition methods that were included in these previous meta-analyses, these studies were only partially able to accurately infer spatial convergence across experiments, as well as dissociations across paradigms and contrasts. In addition, some of these studies relied on earlier implementations of the ALE technique, which allowed for within-study effects (Turkeltaub et al.  ), and critically, more liberal statistical thresholds and multiple comparisons correction methods (Eickhoff et al.  ). Finally, another aspect that is difficult to evaluate retrospectively was the finding of two\u00a0errors in the multiple comparisons correction step in earlier implementations of GingerALE (Eickhoff et al.  ), which presumably\u00a0affected the meta-analyses published prior to that report. In this study, we attempted to overcome some of these limitations by applying a conservative multiple comparisons correction method and by including higher field fMRI studies (i.e., 3\u00a0T or 4\u00a0T) to accurately infer the localization of the human FEF in standard space. Our ALE results, obtained by analyzing prosaccades\u2009>\u2009fixation, antisaccades\u2009>\u2009fixation, and prosaccades and antisaccades\u2009>\u2009fixation contrasts across 35 fMRI experiments (see Table S1), show that the highest spatial convergence based on the ALE value was found within two bilateral clusters in the dorsolateral PFC, localized in the anterior bank of the sPCS, near its junction with the SFS (see Fig.\u00a0 ; Table  ). The comparison with one of the most comprehensive brain parcellations available to date (the MMP1 by Glasser et al.  ) revealed some interesting spatial relationships with our results. We found that the FEF ALE peaks did not match the corresponding label from the atlas, suggesting that there may be important differences in the way the FEF is defined across methods. The MMP1 was created by a careful semi-manual delineation combining structural MRI (cortical thickness and myelin ratio), resting-state fMRI connectivity, and retinotopic mapping techniques (Glasser et al.  ). Additionally, fMRI contrasts from nine tasks were also employed to infer areal boundaries, which were chosen to optimally balance breadth vs depth and scan time (Elam et al.  ). Although we regard the MMP1 as a step change in our understanding of brain organization, and of the fine-grained organization and structure of the PFC in humans and non-human primates (Donahue et al.  ), we would like to suggest that more information gathered from task-based fMRI will be needed to better understand the functional subdivision of the posterior-lateral PFC. More specifically, following the labeling scheme proposed by the MMP1, major efforts should be made to isolate FEF activity from posterior activity in the premotor cortex on the one hand (area 6d), and from a newly discovered language selective region (area 55b) that borders the FEF ventrally on the other (Glasser et al.  ). Ultimately, future developments of a functional localization method will facilitate the convergence of atlas-based and meta-analytic fMRI information to allow the delineation of anatomical clusters of activation within FEF with adequate functional specificity. \n\nIn this direction, the seminal fMRI study by Mackey et al. ( ) identified three distinct visual field maps in the PFC localized in the sPCS (sPCS1 and sPCS2) and the iPCS. By examining the correspondences between their results and the MMP1 (see Fig.\u00a08 from their study), they found that the sPCS2 corresponded to the FEF, while the sPCS1 corresponded to areas 6a and 6d. Interestingly, they also reported that in all subjects and both hemispheres, the foveal representation was localized in the fundus of the sPCS, at its intersection with the SFS. This description closely matches the localization of our ALE peaks, which raises the question of whether the fMRI contrasts we included in the present meta-analysis could be targeting specific neural populations within the FEF. It is well established that in the macaque, a population of neurons shows increased firing rates when the animal is fixating and is inhibited when executing saccades (hence termed \u2018fixation\u2019 neurons; Hanes et al.  ; Lowe and Schall  ). Are these neural populations also present in humans, and how are they distributed within the FEF? What is the role of saccadic amplitude in isolating peaks of activity within the FEF (see Grosbras  )? An additional aspect that may be worth investigating is whether the activations found in one or more of these clusters (for example, the iFEF) are dependent on some artifacts present in the experimental design or analysis. In the 35 experiments we analyzed, 10 did not record eye movements in the scanner (see Table S1), leaving open the possibility that some of these clusters may have also been driven by spurious neural activity that was not exclusively related to saccadic behavior. It is well documented that eye blinks can contaminate BOLD signal (Bristow et al.  ; Hup\u00e9 et al.  ), and this fact was invoked to explain discrepancies in the oculomotor organization in primates (Tehovnik et al.  ) and as a signal driving iFEF responses (Amiez and Petrides  ; Kato and Miyauchi  ). In conclusion, we strongly agree with the general caveat that the way the FEF is defined is ultimately constrained by the technique employed (Schall et al.  ; Vernet et al.  ), and in particular its spatial resolution. The localization and the extent of the FEF cluster should be inferred based on the convergence of multiple criteria (primarily architectonic, sulcal, functional, connectional, and also comparative). In the present study, we provided a standard using ALE, which we suggest can lead to clarifying how inter-individual variability affects FEF localization and its relationship to sulcal organization (Amiez et al.  ; Glasser et al.  ). Refinements in the careful mapping of the human FEF will be essential to bridge research in humans and non-human primates and for testing hypotheses about homologies in the organization of the PFC across species, for example, based on connectivity information (Hutchison et al.  ; Mars et al.  ; Neggers et al.  ; Sallet et al.  ). \n\n\n### IFJ localization in standard space \n  \nThe study of the role of the ventrolateral PFC in various cognitive functions such as visual attention, working memory, and cognitive control led to the definition of the IFJ as a separate brain region involved in critical aspects of all these functions (Baldauf and Desimone  ; Brass et al.  ; Derrfuss et al.  ; Zanto et al.  ). This region appears to be tightly coupled with specific sulcal landmarks (Derrfuss et al.  ) and belongs to the frontoparietal network (Cole and Schneider  ; Yeo et al.  ). In this study, we pooled together results from the various tasks that have been used to localize this region (see Table S2) ranging from attentional (i.e., RSVP/oddball; Asplund et al.  ; and endogenous cueing paradigms; Baldauf and Desimone  ; Zhang et al.  ), working memory (primarily n-back paradigms; Rottschy et al.  ; Zanto et al.  ), and cognitive control paradigms (i.e., task-switching and Stroop tasks; Derrfuss et al.  ). Following a previous ALE meta-analysis (Derrfuss et al.  ), we reasoned that the spatial convergence across these paradigms (rather than a single task and/or contrast) would allow us to accurately infer the localization of the IFJ in standard space. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found two prominent clusters of activation in the ventrolateral PFC. Based on the ALE peak values, the highest convergence was found in the posterior bank of the iPCS, approximately at the height of its ventral junction with the IFS (see Fig.\u00a0 ; Table  ). The comparison of these results with the MMP1 revealed additional interesting topographic differences. The IFJ ALE peaks were localized just ventral and slightly posterior to the corresponding labels from the atlas (IFJa and IFJp), and the ALE clusters included vertices from several other brain regions. These results suggest that many of the paradigms that target the IFJ will also tend to involve adjacent multiple-demand regions, which may conceal its exact boundaries. \n\nAn interesting approach combining different paradigms and using a conjunction analysis to localize the IFJ was presented by Stiers and Goulas ( ), which may overcome some of the previous limitations. The authors analyzed the voxel responses across three different tasks (Eriksen flanker task, back matching or n-back task, and a response scheme switching task) to define the prefrontal nodes of the multiple-demand system in 12 subjects. A manipulation of task difficulty in each of the previous tasks was used to identify voxels that were modulated by increasing cognitive demands, which were used to define ROIs in each subject in a conjunction analysis across tasks for further analyzing their relative task preference and functional connectivity patterns. This analysis revealed local maxima of activity within the IFJ, where voxels with different task preferences exhibited distinct functional connectivity patterns with the rest of the brain (Stiers and Goulas  ). Based on these results, it may be argued that no single task alone would adequately capture the selectivity patterns of neural populations within the IFJ; rather, manipulations of task difficulty combined with the administration of different paradigms could provide an unbiased way of localizing this region in individual participants. The present study provides a standard using ALE, which should help further understand how inter-individual variability affects IFJ localization and its relationship to sulcal organization (Derrfuss et al.  ). Future meta-analyses should better clarify how activations from different tasks that tap cognitive control functions map onto the ventro-lateral PFC and assess whether they may recruit distinct subregions near the IFJ (Nee et al.  ), which was, however, outside the scope of our present work (see Rodr\u00edguez-Nieto et al.   for a comprehensive meta-analysis). \n\n\n### Whole-brain coactivation patterns of the FEF and IFJ \n  \nAn additional\u00a0goal of the present study was to uncover the task-based functional connectivity fingerprint of the FEF and the IFJ in a data-driven fashion. We retrieved from the BrainMap database all the studies that reported activations within a cuboid seed centered around the FEF and IFJ standard coordinates found in our ALE main localizer analyses and we employed the MACM technique to uncover their coactivation profiles (Langner and Camilleri  ). Importantly, while previous studies already performed MACM analyses on the FEF (Cieslik et al.  ; Genon et al.  ) and the IFJ (Muhle-Karbe et al.  ; Sundermann and Pfleiderer  ), our study is to our knowledge the first that used this technique on the results of an ALE analysis specifically aimed at localizing these regions (and not a manual or atlas-based delineation) using a narrow seed extent (6\u00a0mm). Our MACM analysis allowed adequately powered inference in each seed region (Eickhoff et al.  ) and revealed broad networks of coactivations that encompassed the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices (see Fig.\u00a0 ). The most remarkable differences between FEF and IFJ coactivation patterns were that on the one hand, the LH FEF\u00a0and RH FEF coactivated with the bilateral ventrolateral PFC (iFEF and IFJ), whereas only the LH IFJ coactivated with the LH\u00a0FEF in the experiments retrieved. On the other hand, the LH IFJ had stronger and more widespread coactivations in PFC and the insular cortex and was also coactivated with the inferotemporal cortex. These coactivation patterns may be essential for the IFJ to perform its role in feature- and object-based attention tasks (Baldauf and Desimone  ; De Vries et al.  ; Liu et al.  ; Liu  ; Meyyappan et al.  ; Soyuhos and Baldauf  ; Zhang et al.  ) and could be in turn supported by its underlying anatomical connectivity patterns (Baldauf and Desimone  ; Bedini et al.  ). These results are consistent with the idea of a dorso-ventral segregation of frontoparietal coactivations forming a \u2018spatial/motor\u2019 and a \u2018non-spatial/motor network\u2019, which are in turn associated with the first and third branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, respectively (Parlatini et al.  ). In addition, the MACM contrast between the coactivation patterns of FEF and IFJ fit very well with a recent report of these regions\u2019 functional connectivity in source-reconstructed resting-state MEG data, which showed stronger connectivity of the\u00a0FEF with the dorsal \u2018where\u2019 visual pathway (especially in the alpha and beta bands), and stronger connectivity of the\u00a0IFJ with the ventral \u2018what\u2019 visual pathway (especially in the delta and gamma bands; Soyuhos and Baldauf  ). Finally, our functional decoding results suggest that these systematic coactivation patterns allow these regions to support multiple yet specialized roles in flexible goal-driven behavior (Assem et al.  ; Genon et al.  ; Muhle-Karbe et al.  ; Ngo et al.  ; Ruland et al.  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur study provides the accurate localization of two regions of the posterior-lateral PFC, namely the FEF and the IFJ. These regions are tightly coupled with sulcal landmarks as measured using fMRI across over 400 and 500\u00a0subjects,\u00a0respectively, with the FEF being localized at the junction of the sPCS and the SFS, and the IFJ at the junction of the iPCS and the IFS. Functionally, they appear to be organized according to a dorso-ventral gradient, going from areas responsible for sensorimotor transformations and action execution (FEF, iFEF), to areas that are involved in maintaining and updating behavioral goals according to internal representations (IFJ; Abdallah et al. 2022; Nee et al.  ; O\u2019Reilly  ). Taken together, our findings aim at proposing a consensus localization of these regions in standard space, and meta-analytic groundwork to investigate the relationship between functional specialization and connectivity in large publicly available neuroimaging datasets (e.g., Markiewicz et al.  ; Van Essen et al.  ), as well as to guide future non-invasive brain stimulation studies. \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10147761, "text_md5": "26b332bf8ad605062a5e14b62455d36d", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 75], "journal": [76, 94], "publication_year": [96, 100], "title": [111, 249], "keywords": [263, 392], "abstract": [405, 2404], "body": [2413, 77122]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 37093304, "doi": "10.1007/s00429-023-02641-y", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10147761", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10147761"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10147761\">10147761</a>", "list_title": "PMC10147761  Accurate localization and coactivation profiles of the frontal eye field and inferior frontal junction: an ALE and MACM fMRI meta-analysis"}

Its effects can also be observed in domains that usually remain well preserved, such as language and creativity, when contextual demands are high [ , ]. For instance, in the domain of semantic cognition, the decline of cognitive control is reflected by poorer semantic selection processes with age, such as inhibiting irrelevant semantic associations, but not semantic representations per se [ ]. \n\nOn the neural level, age-related changes in semantic cognition are mirrored by a shifted network architecture with increased activity of domain-general networks during task processing [ ] and increased coupling of distinct functional networks [ ]. It has been suggested that the stronger coupling of usually anti-correlated networks in healthy aging, such as the multiple-demand network (MDN) and the default mode network (DMN), might contribute to the maintenance of semantic processing, since older adults can rely on their preserved semantic knowledge [ , ]. When task demands increase, however, slower and less accurate behavior might be observed since the neural network of semantic control is multidimensional, consisting of domain-specific semantic control, which subserves processes such as the controlled retrieval of less salient conceptual features, and domain-general control, which supports general selection and inhibition mechanisms. This notion is supported by the observation that brain regions that are active in tasks with high semantic control demands partially overlap with areas of the MDN [ ] and the ventral attention network. However, the functional relevance of domain-general network recruitment for semantic cognition in the aging brain remains largely unclear. \n\nNon-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques are recognized as a promising approach to counteract age-related cognitive decline and promote successful aging. These techniques may have the potential to support preservation of cognitive functions in pathological but also healthy aging through modulation of cortical excitability and the enhancement of neuroplasticity [ , ]. Especially the application of theta-burst stimulation (TBS), a patterned protocol of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), has gained increasing interest since it is thought to induce longer-lasting after-effects [ ]. So far, only a few studies explored the modulatory effects of TBS on cognition in aging brains [ ,  ,  ,  ]. The results are heterogeneous, and only one study found improved memory performance after iTBS [ ], whereas others revealed changes in task-related activity and connectivity only [ ] or non-specific effects of inhibitory stimulation [ ]. \n\nComplementary insight can be gained by investigating the effect of stimulation on neural activity and functional connectivity. Neuroimaging results can help interpreting behavioral effects and might even be observed in the absence of a stimulation-induced behavioral change [ ]. A better understanding of the modulatory effects of TBS at the neural level would increase the efficiency of network stimulation in aging brains. Such network approaches may be more powerful than conventional modulatory applications that target specific brain regions within specialized networks [ ]. \n\nIn the domain of semantic cognition, only a few studies explored the effect of electrical stimulation at the neural level. These studies associated improved performance with a reduction of age-related upregulation in activity [ , ] and increases in functional connectivity between task-relevant regions of interest in the prefrontal cortex [ ]. So far, no study explored the potential of rTMS to modulate age-related changes in semantic cognition on the behavioral and neural level. \n\nThis study aimed to determine if iTBS could enhance semantic and executive task processing in healthy middle-aged to older adults. The pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) was targeted for stimulation using effective and sham intermittent TBS (iTBS), as it is associated with the semantic control network and the domain-general MDN [ , ], and contributes more to semantic processing in older adults [ , ]. It has been shown to be involved in language learning in healthy young adults [ ] and in the recovery of language after stroke [ ]. Moreover, a recent investigation emphasized the crucial role of semantic control regions in the association cortex for semantic cognition [ ]. The location of the pre-SMA between frontoparietal control and default mode networks enables its unique functional profile combining executive control and meaningful representations. \n\nWe included middle-aged to older adults since executive functions like alertness and inhibitory control have been shown to decline from middle age [ , ], which might increase the modulatory potential of TBS in this age group. Using a verbal semantic judgment task with varying cognitive demand and a non-verbal tone judgment task, we were interested in the effect of iTBS on task-based activity and functional connectivity and its relationship with behavior. Specifically, we implemented a cognitively more demanding feature-picture matching (FPM) and a low-level word-picture matching (WPM) task to distinguish stimulation effects on semantic control. Further, the tone judgment task was included to characterize the modulatory effect of pre-SMA stimulation on non-verbal executive demands. \n\nWe hypothesized that iTBS modulates processing efficiency through faster responses on the behavioral level and increased whole-brain activity as well as enhanced remote network modulation for our conditions with high cognitive load, FPM and tone judgment. Further, if the pre-SMA contributes to semantic control, comparing FPM with the low-level WPM might reveal task-specific stimulation effects beyond general cognitive control. Finally, we aimed to elucidate how stimulation-induced changes in activity and connectivity relate to behavioral modulation. \n\n\n## Material and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThirty healthy middle-aged to older adults (14 female;   M  \u00a0=\u00a061.6,   SD  \u00a0=\u00a07.64, range: 45\u201374 years) participated in the experiment. Inclusion criteria were native German speaker, right-handedness, normal hearing, normal or corrected-to-normal vision, no history of neurological or psychiatric conditions, and no contraindication to MRI or rTMS. Participants were also screened for cognitive impairments using the Mini-Mental-State-Examination [ ] (all   \u2265   26/30 points). Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Experimental Design \n  \n displays the experimental procedure. We employed a single-blind, cross-over design with three sessions per participant ( A). Sessions were separated by at least one week (mean inter-session interval: 28.4 days;   SD  : 51.2). During the first session (baseline), participants completed two runs of a language localizer task and two runs of the experimental task. The second and third session each began with effective or sham iTBS over the pre-SMA ( C). Participants subsequently completed two runs of the experimental paradigm. The order of effective and sham sessions was counterbalanced across participants.   \n Experimental Design.   (A) Participants completed three sessions: a baseline fMRI session and two iTBS\u00a0+\u00a0fMRI sessions with effective and sham stimulation. (B) Per fMRI session, two task runs were completed. Blocks of the semantic judgment and the tone judgment task were interspersed with rest blocks. (C) We simulated the average electrical field at our target site, the pre-SMA (visualized on the normalized cortical surface). (D) Example trials for the semantic and the tone judgment task are shown. Participants heard a short phrase or a sequence of two tones. At the offset of the auditory stimulus, a picture of an object or an arrow appeared. Participants indicated via button press whether auditory and visual stimuli matched. RMT: resting motor threshold, WPM: word-picture matching, FPM: feature-picture matching. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n### Experimental paradigm \n  \nTwo tasks were implemented in the fMRI experiment: a semantic judgment task with varying cognitive demand (low demand: WPM, high demand: FPM) and a non-verbal tone judgment task ( B and D). Stimuli of the tasks are described in more detail in Supplementary Methods. In both tasks, participants were required to decide whether an auditory stimulus matches with a presented image via yes/no-button press using the index and middle finger of their left hand. The left hand was used to shift motor activity related to the button press to the right hemisphere. The order of buttons was counterbalanced across participants. Tasks were presented in mini-blocks of four trials per task and blocks were separated by short rest intervals. Individual trials were 3.5\u00a0s long including presentation of auditory and visual stimulus, and button press by the participant. Each run included 88 stimuli with 32 items per condition of semantic judgment and 24 items of tone judgment. Participants completed two runs per session. \n\n\n### Magnetic resonance imaging \n  \nMRI data were collected at a 3T Siemens Magnetom Skyra scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head coil. For functional scans, a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging multiband sequence [ ] was used with the following parameters: TR: 2000\u00a0ms, TE: 22\u00a0ms, flip angle: 80\u00b0, voxel size: 2.48\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.48\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.75\u00a0mm, FOV: 204\u00a0mm, multiband acceleration factor: 3, 60 axial whole-brain slices with interleaved order. For the language localizer task, 266\u00a0volumes were acquired. For the experimental task, a total of 842\u00a0volumes per session were acquired. For distortion correction, field maps (pepolar images) were obtained at the end of each session (TR: 8000\u00a0ms, TE: 50\u00a0ms). A T1-weighted volume was acquired using an MPRAGE sequence (176 slices, whole-brain coverage, TR: 2300\u00a0ms, TE: 2.98\u00a0ms, voxel size: 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm, matrix size: 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240\u00a0mm, flip angle: 9\u00b0). \n\n\n### Intermittent theta burst stimulation \n  \nrTMS was delivered using the iTBS protocol which consists of bursts of three pulses at 50\u00a0Hz given every 200\u00a0ms in 2\u00a0s trains, repeated every 10\u00a0s over 190\u00a0s for a total of 600 pulses [ ]. We chose TBS since its high-frequency protocols have been reported to induce longer lasting after-effects with a duration of up to 1\u00a0h [ ]. iTBS was applied via stereotactic neuronavigation (TMS Navigator, Localite, Bonn, Germany) and a MagPro \u00d7100 stimulator (MagVenture, Farum, Denmark) with an MCF-B65 figure-of-eight coil. For sham stimulation, we used the corresponding placebo coil (MCF-P-B65). During stimulation, the coil handle was pointed in a 90\u00b0 angle [e.g., [ , ]] and intensity was set to 90% of individual resting motor threshold (RMT; mean RMT: 51.5%, SD: 4.6%, mean stimulation intensity: 46.3%, SD: 4.2% maximum stimulator output). RMT was defined as the lowest stimulation intensity producing at least five motor evoked potentials of   \u2265  50\u00a0\u03bcV in the relaxed first dorsal interosseous muscle when single-pulse TMS was applied to the right motor cortex ten times. We decided to apply iTBS with 90% RMT since we wanted to ensure effective but safe stimulation. Though not the most common intensity for TBS, 90% RMT has been applied before [ ] and previous work has revealed that a higher stimulation intensity can lead to an atypical (that is, reversed) effect on cortico-spinal excitability [ ]. However, how this affects non-motor behavior has not been explored yet. \n\nStimulation coordinates for iTBS over the pre-SMA were based on individual activation patterns for the contrast semantic judgment\u00a0>\u00a0rest within a pre-defined region of interest (ROI) mask of the pre-SMA [ ]. The stimulation target was defined as the global peak of the strongest cluster within the pre-SMA ROI in individuals\u2019 subject space after FWE-correction at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05. For plots of the individual stimulation sites within the ROI, see  . We performed electrical field simulations using SimNIBS v.4.0.0 [ ] to characterize location, extent, and strength of the electrical field induced by iTBS over the pre-SMA in each individual subject.  C displays the average electrical field while individual fields are shown in  . \n\n\n### Data analyses \n  \nAll behavioral data as well as extracted beta weights generated or analyzed during this study have been deposited in a public repository on OSF  . This repository also holds all self-written analysis code used for this project. Unthresholded statistical group maps for fMRI and gPPI results are made publicly available on NeuroVault:  . \n\n#### Behavioral data \n  \nAccuracy and reaction time data of each session were analyzed using mixed-effects models with a logistic regression for accuracy data due to their binary nature and a linear regression for log-transformed reaction time data. We only analyzed reaction times for correct responses. Contrast coding was done via simple coding. Based on our research questions, session (i.e., baseline, effective or sham stimulation) and condition (WPM, FPM or tone judgment) along with their interaction term were always entered as fixed effects. \n\nNext, we used stepwise model selection to determine the best-fitting model based on the Akaike Information Criterion.   display the model selection procedures. Equations  ) show the best-fitting model for accuracy and reaction time data, respectively. We also assessed a potential effect of years of education on performance but did not find a significant correlation with average accuracy (r\u00a0=\u00a00.22, p\u00a0=\u00a00.27) or reaction time (r\u00a0=\u00a00.091, p\u00a0=\u00a00.64). Statistical models were performed with R v.4.2.1 [ ] and the packages lme4 [ ] for mixed models and bblme [ ] for model comparisons. Plots and result tables were generated using the packages sjPlot [ ] and ggeffects [ ]. \n\n\n#### Whole-brain analyses \n  \nPreprocessing of MRI data was performed using fMRIPrep 20.2.3 [ ] which is based on Nipype 1.6.1 [ ]. A detailed description can be found in Supplementary Materials. Functional MRI data were modelled using a general linear model (GLM) for each session and participant. For the localizer, the GLM included regressors for the task blocks of intact and degraded listening. For the experimental task, regressors for the three conditions and a separate regressor for error trials were included in the GLM. To account for condition- and trial-specific differences in reaction time, the duration of a trial was defined as the length of the auditory stimulus plus the reaction time. Additional regressors included six motion parameters and individual regressors for strong volume-to-volume movement as indicated by values of framewise displacement > 0.7. Further, temporal and spatial derivatives were modelled for each condition, and a high-pass filter was applied to remove low-frequency noise. \n\nContrast images were entered intro group-level random effects models. For the first session, one-sample t-tests were computed to define condition-specific activation. To assess differences between effective and sham iTBS, contrast images from the sham session were subtracted from the effective session, and the difference images were submitted to random effects models where session effects were estimated using one-sample t-tests. Results were thresholded at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05\u00a0at peak level and corrected at cluster level for FWE rate at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05. These models also included regressors for age and age-squared to account for the large age range and regressors for gray matter volume (GMV) and total intracranial volume (TIV) to account for age-related differences in GMV. We used the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12) in SPM12 to segment structural images and to calculate gray matter volume (GMV) and total intracranial volume. \n\nTo assess the relationship between differences in activation and differences in behavior induced by iTBS, we extracted percent signal change (PSC) for our a-priori defined stimulation site pre-SMA and for clusters showing a significant effect of stimulation (  n  \u00a0=\u00a06; see  ) using the MarsBar toolbox [ ]. For the pre-SMA, PSC was extracted for a cluster centered at each individual stimulation site and containing the 25% strongest activated voxels for the contrast semantic judgment\u00a0>\u00a0rest, which was identical to the contrast used for the definition of the stimulation site. Data were then entered into correlation analyses where the difference in PSC for a certain condition was correlated with the difference in accuracy and reaction time between effective and sham sessions.   \nUnivariate fMRI results \u2013 effective\u00a0>\u00a0sham iTBS. \n  Table 1     \n\n\n#### Analysis of subject-specific functional regions of interest \n  \nData from the language localizer task were analyzed employing the group-constrained subject-specific approach [ ]. This method allows the identification of individual functional ROIs sensitive to language processing [ ], which were then used to characterize response profiles in the independent data set of the experimental task. We did not find any significant effect of stimulation session on activation in the functional ROIs. Details on analysis and results of subject-specific functional ROIs are described in Supplementary Methods and visualized in  . \n\n\n#### Seed-based functional connectivity analysis \n  \nTo assess potential changes in functional connectivity induced by iTBS, we conducted psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses using the gPPI toolbox [ ]. Seed regions were defined for significant global cluster peaks for the contrast of effective and sham session (  n  \u00a0=\u00a06 regions, cf.  ) and for our stimulation site, bilateral pre-SMA. Binary, resampled masks were created for each seed by building a spherical ROI with a radius of 10\u00a0mm. Next, individual ROIs were built by extracting the 25% most active voxels in each seed mask of a given contrast image. \n\nFor the gPPI, individual regression models were set up for each ROI and session containing the deconvolved time series of the first eigenvariate of the BOLD signal from the respective ROI as the physiological variable, regressors for the three task conditions and errors as the psychological variable, and the interaction of both variables as the PPI term. Models were adjusted for an omnibus F-test of all task regressors. Subsequently, first-level GLMs were calculated. We were specifically interested in potential differences between effective and sham iTBS sessions for the contrasts FPM\u00a0>\u00a0WPM and FPM\u00a0>\u00a0tone judgment. Random-effects models for group analysis were set up as described for the univariate analysis. Results were thresholded at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001\u00a0at peak level and FWE-corrected   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05\u00a0at cluster level. \n\nWe also explored a relationship between stimulation-induced changes in functional connectivity and behavior. To this end, we extracted pre-SMA-to-ROI PPI connectivity for effective and sham sessions for the contrast semantic judgment\u00a0>\u00a0tone judgment where ROI refers to the six seed regions described above. We then correlated the difference between effective and sham connectivity for each pre-SMA-ROI pair with the difference between effective and sham in accuracy and reaction time. Multiple comparison correction was applied via the Bonferroni-Holm method. \n\n\n#### Whole-brain functional connectivity analysis \n  \nWe applied whole-brain functional connectivity analyses to explore iTBS-induced changes in the coupling of large-scale networks. To this end, we extracted functional time series for seven large networks from a common whole-brain parcellation [ ] and two semantic networks (general semantic cognition and semantic control) from a recent meta-analysis on semantic cognition [ ]. Time series extraction was done for non-smoothed functional data and included the following denoising pipeline: 24 realignment parameters (six motion parameters, temporal derivatives, and quadratic terms) and top five aCompCor components for white matter and cerebral spinal fluid, respectively. Censoring included a FD threshold of 0.7\u00a0mm and 12 discrete cosine-basis regressors to account for signal drifts. All these regressors were combined in a design matrix and removed from the data in a single step [ , ]. Further, time series were detrended and demeaned, and functional images were masked with a subject-specific, resampled gray matter mask before denoising. We then applied correlational psychophysiological interaction analyses (cPPI) [ ] to obtain connectivity terms that describe task-related interactions for our contrasts of interest FPM vs. WPM and FPM vs. tone judgment between the selected networks. cPPI analyses were calculated separately for effective and sham stimulation sessions. To obtain significant changes in network interactions after effective relative to sham iTBS, we used network-based statistics (NBS) on the Fisher-transformed correlation matrices of each session. We ran a paired   t  -test within the NBS toolbox [ ] with an initial cluster-forming threshold at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 (  t  \u00a0=\u00a01.69) and an FWE-corrected significance threshold at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 with 10,000 permutations. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nFor accuracy, the three-way interaction between session, condition, and congruency was not significant (  x  \u00a0=\u00a07.83,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.099). However, we detected a significant interaction between condition and congruency (  x  \u00a0=\u00a053.15,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001) and session and condition (  x  \u00a0=\u00a021.8,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001;  C). For session and condition, post-hoc tests showed a significant difference only for the tone task, such that participants performed generally better after the baseline session (active iTBS\u00a0>\u00a0baseline:   OR  \u00a0=\u00a00.41,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001; sham iTBS\u00a0>\u00a0baseline:   OR  \u00a0=\u00a00.57,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.002). Moreover, we found main effects of condition (  x  \u00a0=\u00a0279.34,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001) and congruency (  x  \u00a0=\u00a077.32,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001) but not of session (  x  \u00a0=\u00a02.79,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.25). Post-hoc tests revealed overall better performance for WPM than FPM (  OR  \u00a0=\u00a05.77,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001) and tone judgment (  OR  \u00a0=\u00a03.55,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001). For congruency, accuracy was higher for incongruent than congruent items (  OR  \u00a0=\u00a00.5,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001). Post-hoc tests showed that incongruent items had higher accuracy in semantic conditions (WPM:   OR  \u00a0=\u00a00.38,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001; FPM:   OR  \u00a0=\u00a00.31,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001) but not tone judgments (  OR  \u00a0=\u00a01.18,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.25).   \n Behavioral results.

Reaction times improved for all three conditions after the baseline session (all   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.01). However, there was no difference in reaction time between effective and sham iTBS sessions. Results also showed a significant interaction between condition and congruency (  x  \u00a0=\u00a0306.53,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001). For FPM, incongruent items were faster (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.034), while for tone judgment, congruent items were faster (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001). Further, we found that reactions times generally increased with age (  x  \u00a0=\u00a09.4,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.002). Full results of both models are shown in  . \n\n\n### Univariate functional MRI data \n  \n#### The effect of conditions at baseline \n  \nBoth semantic and tone judgment activated large whole-brain networks with a stronger left lateralization for the semantic task and a more bilateral pattern for the tone task ( ). When contrasting individual semantic conditions, WPM and FPM, with tone judgment, they each activated a left-lateralized fronto-temporo-occipital network consisting of semantic representation and control regions ( A&B). Tone judgment, on the other hand, activated a frontoparietal network of cognitive control regions encompassing right middle, superior, and inferior frontal gyri, angular gyrus, and precuneus, confirming the non-verbal, high executive demand of this task ( A&B). Notably, tone judgment\u00a0>\u00a0WPM activated a cluster in the pre-SMA and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex that was not present for tone judgment\u00a0>\u00a0FPM, pointing towards the extended cognitive demand for feature-compared with word-picture matching. This was further confirmed by the direct comparison of both semantic conditions showing increased activity for FPM in domain-specific semantic control regions (left pMTG and IFG) and domain-general cognitive control including left SFG and SPL ( C).   lists results for all univariate comparisons.   \n Univariate activation results for experimental conditions during the baseline session.   (A) Results for feature-picture matching (FPM) contrasted with tone judgment, (B) results for word-picture matching (WPM) contrasted with tone judgment, and (C) contrasting both semantic conditions, WPM and FPM, with each other. Results are FWE-corrected at peak level p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 (t\u00a0>\u00a06.21) with a minimal cluster size k\u00a0=\u00a010 voxels. \n  Fig. 3   \n\n\n#### iTBS increases task-specific activity for high semantic control demand in the attention network \n  \nResults revealed stronger activation after effective compared with sham sessions for both semantic conditions. Compared with rest, there was stronger activation for FPM after effective stimulation in left SPL extending into cuneus and in right AG, occipital, and fusiform gyrus ( A). When contrasted with tone judgment, a cluster in left occipital lobe and fusiform gyrus was detected ( A).   displays detailed results for FPM and WPM. Results for WPM are visualized in  . The direct comparison of effective and sham iTBS for FPM and WPM did not reveal significant differences.   \n Effect of stimulation on brain activation.   After effective stimulation, stronger activation was found for (A) feature-picture matching (FPM) compared with rest (implicit baseline) and tone judgment. We extracted percent signal change (PSC) for significant clusters and correlated the difference in PSC between effective and sham sessions with the difference in behavior between effective and sham sessions. (B) For \u0394 of accuracy of FPM, a negative correlation with the difference in PSC in the left superior parietal lobe (SPL) was detected. fMRI results are thresholded at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05\u00a0at peak level (t\u00a0>\u00a01.71) and FWE-corrected at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05\u00a0at cluster level. \n  Fig. 4   \n\n\n#### Increased activity after iTBS is associated with poorer semantic control \n  \nWe correlated the difference in PSC (effective\u00a0>\u00a0sham iTBS) for the stimulation site pre-SMA and for cluster peaks that showed an effect of stimulation ( ) with the difference in behavior. Results showed a negative correlation for accuracy of FPM with a cluster in left dorsal SPL (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.37,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.044;  B) such that less PSC after effective iTBS was associated with higher accuracy after iTBS. We did not detect any significant associations with reaction time. \n\n\n#### iTBS modulates task-specific connectivity in domain-general networks \n  \nAnalysis of seed-based functional connectivity revealed that two seed regions extracted from the univariate stimulation results showed changes in functional connectivity after effective compared with sham stimulation: left ventral SPL and occipital pole. Both regions showed greater whole-brain coupling for FPM than WPM after effective stimulation. Additionally, the left SPL also showed greater connectivity for tone judgment\u00a0>\u00a0FPM ( A;  ). The left occipital pole showed stronger connectivity with clusters in right precuneus, which was associated with the DMN, the right SPL, which linked to the dorsal attention network, and the left cerebellum. The seed in the left SPL showed different patterns of increased coupling for FPM and tone judgment. For FPM, we found increased activation in left posterior MTG, which is associated with the temporoparietal subnetwork of the DMN. For tone judgment on the other hand, the left SPL coupled with a cluster in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which was associated with the ventral attention network.  B shows the overlap of all clusters with a common network parcellation [ ]. Extracted parameter estimates showed that for the contrast FPM\u00a0>\u00a0WPM, interactions were mainly driven by reduced activation in these clusters for WPM, whereas activation increased for tone judgment for the contrast tone judgment\u00a0>\u00a0FPM ( C). Seeding in our stimulation site, the pre-SMA, did not reveal significant changes in functional connectivity.   \n Seed-based and whole-brain functional connectivity.   (A) Two seeds showed increased whole-brain coupling after effective relative to sham stimulation. Only the left ventral SPL seed showed stronger coupling for the task contrasts FPM\u00a0>\u00a0WPM and tone judgment\u00a0>\u00a0FPM. fMRI results are thresholded at p\u00a0<\u00a00.001\u00a0at peak level (t\u00a0>\u00a03.55) and FWE-corrected at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05\u00a0at cluster level. (B) Binary PPI activation maps plotted onto a seven-networks functional connectivity parcellation (Yeo et al., 2011). C) Parameter estimates extracted for significant clusters of functional connectivity results for each seed and respective contrast. Parameter estimates reflect beta values of each task condition against rest. (D) Chord diagram displays significant differences in functional coupling between effective and sham stimulation. Results for the task contrast FPM\u00a0>\u00a0WPM revealed reduced functional connectivity between domain-general networks after effective relative to sham stimulation. The color intensity and width of a connection indicate its correlational strength. \n  Fig. 5   \n\nFinally, results from whole-brain connectivity analysis revealed reduced coupling of domain-general networks after effective compared with sham stimulation for the task contrast FPM vs. WPM ( D). Coupling between higher-order cognitive networks and between higher-order cognitive networks and primary sensory and motor networks was stronger during sham than effective iTBS. However, iTBS did not have a significant effect on the coupling of task-specific semantic networks. \n\n\n#### Increased coupling of executive networks after iTBS is associated with faster performance for the most demanding semantic condition \n  \nWe explored stimulation-induced changes in connectivity from our target site pre-SMA to gPPI ROIs and their relationship with behavior. The change in functional connectivity between pre-SMA and left ventral SPL was associated with a change in behavior after effective stimulation ( ).   \n Relationship between stimulation-induced changes in functional connectivity and behavior.   Reduced coupling of pre-SMA and left ventral SPL after effective iTBS was associated with slower reaction times (RT) during the feature-picture matching (FPM) condition after effective relative to sham iTBS. \n  Fig. 6   \n\nMore specifically, a negative correlation (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.51,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.02 after Bonferroni-Holm correction) indicated that responses for FPM were slower the more those two regions were decoupled after effective iTBS. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn light of global population aging and the associated increase in age-related diseases, new interventions are needed to counteract cognitive decline and promote successful aging. NIBS is increasingly recognized as a promising tool to boost cognitive functions in older adults. However, to design effective treatment protocols, a better understanding of the neural mechanisms of NIBS is mandatory. In particular, it remains unclear whether stimulation-induced improvements may be underpinned by decreases or increases in task-related activity and connectivity, or both. Here, we explored the effect of effective relative to sham iTBS over the pre-SMA on the behavioral and neural level during a semantic and a tone judgment task. In the absence of direct behavioral changes, we found significant modulation of task-related activity and connectivity. These changes differed in their functional relevance at the behavioral level. Our main results were as follows: iTBS induced increased activation during semantic processing at remote regions in posterior attention and visual networks. Functional connectivity, on the other hand, was modulated by the executive task demand such that high semantic control demands were linked to more widespread coupling with attention, default, and control networks, whereas non-verbal cognitive control led to stronger coupling with attention and control networks. On the other hand, large-scale domain-general networks showed overall decreased coupling between each other after effective stimulation during semantic processing with high control demands. Strikingly, TMS-induced changes in activation and functional connectivity had differential effects on behavior. While increased activity related to poorer semantic control, enhanced coupling between the stimulation site and the dorsal attention network was linked to faster performance in the most demanding semantic condition. Overall, our findings show that iTBS modulates networks in a task-dependent manner and generates effects at regions remote to the stimulation site. Further, our results shed new light on the role of the pre-SMA in domain-general and semantic control processes, indicating that the pre-SMA supports executive aspects of semantic control. Although iTBS did not induce direct changes in behavior in our sample of healthy middle-aged to older adults, the association between more efficient processing and increased connectivity in attention networks points towards the potential of TMS to counteract cognitive decline and maintain executive processing in aging. \n\n### Higher-order cognitive networks for semantic judgment and tone judgment overlap in the pre-SMA \n  \nOur task paradigm revealed distinct task-specific networks for semantic and tone judgment. Semantic processing activated a left-lateralized fronto-temporal network consisting of semantic representation and control regions [ , ]. Moreover, we found pronounced bilateral activation of middle and posterior fusiform gyri, which have recently been linked to lexical semantics [ ]. Contrasting both conditions of semantic judgment with each other validated the intended modulation of cognitive demand: While WPM showed greater activation in left language perception areas, confirming enhanced phonological and lexical processing during this task, FPM activated core regions of semantic but also domain-general control, indicating increased task demand. Contrarily, the tone judgment task activated a frontoparietal network, which strongly overlapped with the MDN, confirming the non-verbal, high executive demand of this task. \n\n\n### iTBS does not produce direct behavioral changes at the group level \n  \nAlthough univariate fMRI results from the baseline session demonstrated the contribution of the pre-SMA to both experimental tasks, applying effective iTBS to the pre-SMA did not produce direct behavioral changes relative to sham. This result was unexpected. However, we are not the first study to observe stimulation-induced effects on the neural but not behavioral level in healthy older adults [ ]. The lack of a behavioral effect might be due to numerous reasons. First, including a separate baseline session may have affected the chance of observing a stimulation effect since participants were already familiarized with the paradigm and improved across all conditions after the baseline session. Second, offline stimulation might not have been strong enough to induce behavioral changes. Although we took great care to minimize the time between end of stimulation and begin of task-based fMRI, this might have hindered chances for a behavioral effect. Third, the tasks may have been too easy to observe a facilitatory effect of iTBS. This is the first study to use TBS in healthy aging in semantic cognition. While previous work successfully applied anodal electrical stimulation to the left inferior frontal and motor cortex to enhance semantic processing in older adults [ , , ], the potentially facilitatory stimulation of an executive control hub might not have been critical when task performance is already high. Finally, it has been shown that high levels of baseline functional connectivity in the motor system and neurochemical states in task-specific hubs can predict responsiveness to TBS [ ,  ,  ,  ]. These predictors might explain the relatively high individual variability in behavioral changes, that is often observed in TBS [cf.   for a review]. Nonetheless, though unintended, the absence of a stimulation effect on cognition allowed us to interpret alterations on the neural level without the confounds of behavioral changes that might make them harder to interpret otherwise [ , ]. Moreover, the behavioral relevance of these changes was demonstrated in the significant correlations between activity or connectivity increases and behavioral modulation. \n\n\n### iTBS over the pre-SMA increases activity in a widespread network of visual processing and cognitive control \n  \nEffective iTBS generated greater activity in posterior regions but not at the stimulation site. This finding was surprising but is in line with previous observations that TBS produces remote effects in neural networks [ , , ]. Notably, stimulation-induced changes in neural activity were only found for the semantic task and in the occipital cortex, including bilateral lingual gyri and medial occipital lobe. There is emerging evidence from healthy but also patient studies that the occipital cortex, particularly the lingual gyrus, supports language-related and verbal memory tasks [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Thus, the increased activation of these regions mediated by the pre-SMA suggests a top-down control on visual processing regions in a task-specific manner. Moreover, for the FPM condition, we found additional activation in the dorsal attention network after effective stimulation, which illustrates a functional connection with focused attention, likely semantic-specific [ , , ]. \n\n\n### iTBS increases functional coupling of task-relevant networks but decreases overall functional connectivity \n  \nSeed-based functional connectivity analyses showed increased whole-brain coupling for the two conditions with high executive demand, FPM and tone judgment. Notably, which networks showed enhanced coupling was task-dependent. Seeding in a node of the left dorsal attention network, we found increased connectivity with regions in the left temporoparietal subnetwork of the DMN, which is associated with semantic control, and the homologous right dorsal attention network for FPM compared with WPM. For tone judgment compared with FPM, on the other hand, the same seed showed enhanced connectivity with a cluster in middle frontal gyrus, which was linked to the ventral attention network. These findings highlight the potential of iTBS to generate task-specific changes in functional network coupling [ , , ]. Further, it suggests a stimulation-induced modulation of whole-brain functional connectivity in response to executive and attention demands and supports the notion of the pre-SMA as an organizing hub in the MDN, coordinating the interaction of different cognitive control regions [ ]. \n\nIn contrast, whole-brain connectivity analyses revealed reduced coupling during FPM between domain-general networks after effective iTBS. This finding is in line with previous work where multi-session rTMS of the pre-SMA induced reduced network connectivity [ ]. In the absence of direct behavioral changes, this reduction in global network coupling might reflect more efficient network interactions induced by iTBS. Importantly, we did not detect this change in network connectivity for semantic networks, thus emphasizing the effect of pre-SMA stimulation on domain-general but not semantic-specific systems. \n\n\n### iTBS-induced changes in activation and functional connectivity relate differently to behavior \n  \nWhile it might seem surprising that increased activation of the parietal dorsal attention network was linked to poorer accuracy in the semantic task ( ), this finding corroborates the notion that the most efficient task processing is associated with little or no additional functional activation apart from task-specific core regions. This is a common observation in neurocognitive aging, where increased activation and reduced deactivation of domain-general regions have been associated with neural inefficiency, leading to poorer performance across cognitive domains [ , ]. Moreover, better and more efficient behavioral performance due to training-induced activation decreases has been reported in healthy participants [ , ] as well as post-stroke chronic aphasia [ , ]. In our study, task performance was high and remained unchanged after iTBS, indicating a stimulation-induced upregulation of remote cognitive control regions not necessary for efficient task processing.   \niTBS over a hub of the domain-general multiple-demand network enhanced coupling with other cognitive control networks distal to the stimulation site. Stimulation-induced increases in activity of cognitive control networks were linked to poorer performance, while increased connectivity between task-relevant networks was associated with more efficient processing during semantic judgments. \n  Fig. 7   \n\nOn the other hand, increasing functional connectivity between our stimulation site and the upregulated cluster in the parietal dorsal attention network after iTBS was associated with faster responses in the most demanding semantic condition ( ). This result strengthens the idea of a task-specific coupling of cognitive control regions that have been linked to executive components of semantic processing [ , ] and language processing in general [ , ]. Here, we demonstrate that such coupling can enhance the processing efficiency when cognitive demands are high but not the cognitive process per se in form of improved accuracy. \n\nIt should be noted that the results on TMS-induced changes in functional activity only survived a relatively liberal statistical threshold at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05\u00a0at peak level, with a cluster-level correction for FWE rate at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 to ensure multiple comparison correction. Our findings show that the effect of TMS on functional activity can be subtle. However, using these significant clusters as seeds for functional connectivity analyses revealed statistically strong differences between effective and sham stimulation in remote task-relevant networks. Moreover, the present study did not include an additional group of healthy young adults, which would help to further elucidate the age-related effects of iTBS. In its current form, the results show that iTBS has the potential to induce more efficient processing when cognitive demands are high. Future research should explore the age dependency of this effect. \n\nIn conclusion, our results agree with the proposal of an adaptive recruitment of domain-general resources to support language processing, which, however, are less efficient than the specialized domain-specific network [ ]. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of facilitating demanding semantic processing in healthy aging via iTBS over a domain-general hub and reveal the underlying modulation of neural networks. Stimulation effects on activity and connectivity were constrained by the cognitive load of a task and took place within distributed networks. This has implications for future studies on the application of rTMS to counteract cognitive decline and highlights the need of a better understanding of the neural network effects of NIBS in general. Stimulation approaches that target functional reorganization within specialized networks as well as remote additional resources might help to design more efficient treatment protocols in the future. \n\n\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement \n  \n Sandra Martin:   Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing.

Two fMRI-based measures, functional connectivity (FC), a measure of signal synchronicity, and the amplitude of LFFs (ALFF), a measure of signal periodicity, have been proved to be sensitive to changes induced by several neurological diseases, including degenerative dementia. In spite of the increasing use of these measures, whether and how they are related to each other remains to be elucidated. In this work we used voxel-wise FC and ALFF computed in different frequency bands (slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz; slow-4: 0.027-0.073 Hz; and full-band: 0.01-0.073 Hz), in order to assess their relationship in healthy elderly as well as the relevant changes induced by Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). We found that in healthy elderly subjects FC and ALFF are positively correlated in anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (full-band, slow-4 and slow-5), temporal cortex (full-band and slow-5), and in a set of subcortical regions (full-band and slow-4). These correlation patterns between FC and ALFF were absent in either AD or MCI patients. Notably, the loss of correlation between FC and ALFF in the AD group was primarily due to changes in FC rather than in ALFF. Our results indicate that degenerative dementia is characterized by a loss of global connection rather than by a decrease of fluctuation amplitude. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been widely used to investigate the brain function in the absence of a specific task [ ]. The resting brain exhibits low frequency (< 0.1 Hz) fluctuations (LFFs) of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal that are synchronized across functionally related and anatomically connected regions. Although the nature of LFFs is not completely understood, resting-state fMRI has improved the characterization of brain functional architecture. Biswal and colleagues were the first to report highly correlated LFFs in the motor cortex in the absence of task [ ]. Thereafter, several studies have consistently shown that specific patterns of synchronized LFFs identify different resting-state networks (RSNs), including, but not limited to visual, auditory, attentive and the so-called default-mode network (DMN) [ ,  ]. \n\nFunctional connectivity (FC) characterizes the degree of LFFs synchronization in the resting brain. It has been largely inferred by seed-based standard correlation analysis or alternatively by data-driven approaches, such as independent component analysis (ICA) [ ]. These methods are roughly independent from the relative oscillation amplitude, despite its obvious relevance in terms of signal to noise ratio. However, different works have suggested that the amplitude of LFFs   per se   could be of physiological relevance. Biswal and colleagues reported higher values of spectral power in the grey than in the white matter [ ]. Recently, Zang and colleagues formalized the resting-state spectral power by introducing a new quantitative measure, namely the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) [ ]. ALFF measures voxel-wisely the total power of a given BOLD time course within the low-frequency band [ ,  ]. \n\nFC and ALFF have been increasingly used to investigate the brain at rest, although the qualitative and quantitative relationship between them still needs to be fully understood. To the best of our knowledge, one single work examined systematically the relationship between FC and ALFF. Di and colleagues showed a widespread pattern of both positive and negative local correlations between network strength (i.e., ICA-based FC) and ALFF in a healthy elderly population [ ]. Moreover, ALFF values from a number of brain regions, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), precuneus, basal ganglia, thalamus and insula, were found to be correlated with FC in several independent RSNs. This latter evidence suggests that the coupling between FC and ALFF could be a global feature of the brain, which is relevant because the coupling between FC and ALFF likely depends on the way FC is defined. Indeed, while ALFF is a univariate measure univocally defined for each voxel, FC requires the definition of a relation (e.g. Pearson correlation) between features of different voxels or areas. Therefore, a global, voxel-wise measure of FC is perhaps the most appropriate to best match the nature of ALFF and to further investigate the properties of FC vs ALFF coupling. \n\nIn principle, temporal correlation should be independent from the amplitude of compared signals. However, the fact that several pathological states are characterized by partially co-localized changes in FC and ALFF suggests the existence of a specific relationship between them. For example, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; a condition widely regarded as a prodromal stage of AD) patients show altered patterns of FC in specific DMN areas, i.e. posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus, lateral temporal, parietal and medial frontal cortex, as well as hippocampus [ \u2013 ]. Similarly, widespread alterations of ALFF have been reported in AD [ ,  ,  ] and MCI [ \u2013 ] patients. Although a growing body of evidence exists to support impaired LFFs in dementias, there is no systematic study exploring the concomitant changes of FC and ALFF as an effect of neurodegeneration. Indeed, the observed FC reduction in dementia could be related to (i) a concomitant reduction of ALFF towards the noise level or (ii) a loss of synchronization between areas showing unaltered, or possibly increased, fluctuation amplitude. \n\nAlthough the majority of resting state studies have focused on a relative wide range of frequency (e.g., 0.01\u20130.1Hz), converging evidence suggests that a finer band subdivision might provide some additional information. Zuo and colleagues, extending the Buzaski framework on neuronal oscillator classes [ ] to BOLD LFFs, divided the BOLD power spectrum into four distinct frequency ranges, namely slow-5 (0.01\u20130.027 Hz), slow-4 (0.027\u20130.073 Hz), slow-3 (0.073\u20130.198) and slow-2 (0.198\u20130.25 Hz) [ ]. While slow-3 and slow-2 mainly reflect cardiac- and respiratory-related effects, slow-5 and slow-4 appear as stable parameters across scans [ ] with preferential spatial patterns of oscillation [ ,  ]. Moreover, frequency-dependent changes in ALFF have been reported in MCI [ ,  ] and in AD [ ] as well as in other neurological or psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease [ ] and schizophrenia [ ]. Frequency-specific patterns of BOLD fluctuations were also found to be associated with specific personality traits [ ]. In addition to ALFF, FC has also been characterized using a finer band analysis. Indeed, the topological properties of functional brain networks have shown frequency-dependent features, with slow-4 band displaying higher small-world metrics and test-retest reliability as compared to slow-5 [ ]. Band-subdivision has also significantly improved the MCI classification accuracy using graph-theory-based FC [ ]. The origin and the specific physiological function of each frequency band is presently still unknown. Yet, from the spectral properties of FC and ALFF taken separately, we hypothesize that the relationship between ALFF and FC could be frequency-dependent. \n\nIn the present work, we sought to investigate the relationship between ALFF and global FC with a voxel-based approach in the healthy and diseased brain. The main aim of the study was to assess whether the coupling between ALFF and FC depends on anatomical brain localization, frequency band, and pathological conditions. For this purpose, we performed rs-fMRI employing degenerative dementia as a pathological model, and enrolling patients with both AD and MCI. Assuming the existence of a connection between ALFF and the average FC in each voxel with the whole brain, we used a generalized linear model (GLM) to systematically assess to what extent the voxel-wise variance of FC across subjects is explained by the amplitude of the underlying oscillations. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nTen patients with a diagnosis of probable AD by NINCDS-ADRDA consensus criteria [ ], 10 amnestic MCI [ ] patients and 10 healthy elderly subjects (HC) were recruited for this study. A general cognitive evaluation was obtained using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). \n\nAge, education and MMSE score distributions were compared among groups via one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), while a chi-square test was applied to compare gender distribution. Where indicated, two-sample, two-tailed t-tests were performed as post-hoc analyses. \n\nThe current study was approved by the ethics committee of Santa Lucia Foundation. Every recruited subject (or his/her responsible guardians if incapable) gave written consent before MR study initiation. \n\n\n### Data acquisition \n  \nData were acquired on a 3T MRI system (Magnetom Allegra, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). All subjects underwent a resting state fMRI scan using a echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: TR = 2080 ms, TE = 30 ms, 32 axial slices parallel to AC-PC plane, matrix = 64 x 64, in plane resolution = 3x3 mm , slice thickness = 2.5 mm, 50% skip, flip angle = 70\u00b0. Resting scans lasted for 7 minutes and 20 seconds for a total of 220 volumes during which subjects were instructed to keep their eyes closed, to not think of anything in particular and to refrain from falling asleep. A T1-weighted three-dimensional modified driven equilibrium Fourier transform scan (MDEFT, [ ]) was acquired for each subject for anatomical localization purposes and for grey matter (GM) volumetry; the parameters were as follows: TR = 1338 ms, TE = 2.4 ms, TI = 910 ms, flip angle = 15\u00b0,matrix = 256 x 224 x 176, FOV = 256 x 224 mm , slice thickness = 1 mm, total scan time = 12 min. Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images (TR = 8170 ms, TE = 96 ms, TI = 2100 ms) were also acquired from all subjects to exclude the presence of remarkable signs suggestive for cerebro-vascular disease, as previously described [ ]. \n\n\n### Data preprocessing \n  \nFunctional images were preprocessed using Connectivity toolbox (CONN: functional connectivity toolbox [ ]). The first four volumes were discarded to allow signal and scanner stabilization. Images were slice-time corrected and realigned to the first image. For each subject, the mean EPI image, obtained from the realignment step, was used as source image to estimate the transformation parameters to match the functional images with the high resolution T1 volume. Then, all coregistered volumes were normalized into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space coordinates (voxel size: 2x2x2 mm ). Normalized images were then smoothed using an 8x8x8 mm  full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. \n\nBefore statistical analyses, data from each subject underwent physiological noise mitigation. The six parameters of realignment and the first five eigenvectors of the PCA decomposition of the EPI time course averaged over cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and white matter (WM) were regressed out, following aCompCor approach for physiological noise removal [ ]. Data were then detrended and filtered in three different frequency ranges: 1) full-band: 0.01\u20130.073 Hz. 2) Slow-5: 0.01\u20130.027 Hz. 3) Slow-4: 0.027\u20130.073 Hz [ ]. \n\n\n### Grey matter volumetry \n  \nThe T1-weighted MDEFT images were processed using the VBM protocol [ ] implemented in SPM8 ( ), which consists of an iterative combination of segmentations and normalizations to produce a GM probability map [ ] in MNI standard space for every subject. In order to compensate for compression or expansion which might occur during warping of images to match the template, GM maps were \u201cmodulated\u201d by multiplying the intensity of each voxel in the final images by the Jacobian determinant of the transformation, corresponding to its relative volume before and after warping [ ]. All data were then smoothed using a 12x12x12 mm  FWHM Gaussian kernel, and finally the GM volume (GMV) was computed by summing the relevant modulated partition, multiplied by the voxel volume. \n\n\n### Functional connectivity \n  \nVoxel-wise connectivity analysis was carried out using 3dTcorrMap (AFNI package, [ ]) as previously described by others [ ]. For each voxel, Pearson correlation coefficients between each voxel and all other voxels of the brain were computed; then, after a z-Fisher transformation, these coefficients were averaged. The mean value thus obtained expresses the strength of connectivity between each voxel and the rest of the brain (i.e., a measure of global connectivity). Map of global connectivity were produced for each of the three frequency ranges. \n\nVoxel-wise based FC computation is less sensitive than FC obtained by using a seed-based approach, which has been adopted among the others by Di and colleagues [ ]. Nonetheless, the former computation has a higher intrinsic spatial resolution, and it is independent from the arbitrary choice of regions of interest (ROIs). Thus, we adopted a voxel-wise computation of FC as it is closer to the nature of ALFF, being inherently able to map the average value of FC in each single voxel. \n\n\n### ALFF \n  \nFor each voxel in the brain the filtered time series (0.01\u20130.073 Hz) was transformed into the frequency domain using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm (3dPeriodogram; AFNI package, [ ]). The obtained power spectral density was square rooted and averaged in the three frequency bands of interest: full-band, Slow-5 and Slow-4. ALFF maps of each subject were transformed into z-scores [ ]. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nFor each subject group, the mean effects of ALFF and FC were assessed via one-sample, two-tailed t-tests (p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons; see below). Distribution of abnormal ALFF and FC values across groups were evaluated via one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05, corr.). \n\nZ-transformed correlation and ALFF maps from each subject were entered in a second level analysis to assess whether the amplitude of oscillations affects the correlation strength. GLM was applied voxel-wise, considering the FC and ALFF z-scores as dependent and independent variables respectively. Age, gender, education and GM volume were standardized and entered in the model as nuisance covariates. The statistical significance of the regression FC vs ALFF was assessed in each group by one sample, two-tailed t-tests. Within the areas where the regression returned significant coupling in HC, group differences in the strength of correlation were assessed between all experimental groups (i.e., HC, AD and MCI patients) by two-sample, two-tailed t-tests. Model estimation and t-contrasts were replicated for each frequency range. The calculation was carried out with custom software implemented in Matlab R2012a (The Mathworks Inc, Natick, Massachusetts, USA). \n\nStatistical threshold was set to p < 0.05 after correction for multiple comparison, performed by Monte Carlo simulations (AlphaSim; AFNI package, [ ]). The corrected threshold of p < 0.05 corresponds to a single voxel threshold of p < 0.005 with a minimum cluster size of 157 voxels for whole-brain inference. For mask based inferences the minimum cluster size was set around 40 voxels, depending on the mask size. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nPrincipal demographic, clinical data and GMV estimation are reported in  . Patients and controls were matched for age (ANOVA, f = 1.5, p > 0.2) and gender (chi-square test: x  = 1.9, p > 0.3), although patients were less educated than controls (t-tests: AD vs HC, t = -4.0, p < 0.001; MCI vs HC, t = -2.3, p < 0.05). As expected, MMSE scores were significantly different between all groups (t-tests: AD vs HC, t = -6.5, p < 0.001; MCI vs HC, t = -4.6, p < 0.001; MCI vs AD: t = 3.1 p < 0.05). AD patients showed a significant reduction of GMV when compared to both HC and MCI patients (t-tests: AD vs HC, t = -3.9, p < 0.001; AD vs MCI, t = -3.6, p < 0.05). Conversely, despite the presence of a reduction trend in GMV, volumes were not significantly different between MCI patients and HC (t-test: MCI vs HC, t = -1.4, p > 0.1). \n   Principal characteristics of studied subjects.        \nFC and ALFF maps in the full-band range are shown for each studied group in  . Voxel-wise FC analysis reproduced patterns of connectivity in agreement with those reported by others using similar measures of global FC [ ,  ]. In particular, our results showed strongly connected regions belonging to the DMN, such as the precuneus/PCC, mPFC/ ventral ACC, and the inferior temporal/parietal cortex. These patterns are more overtly appreciated using a higher statistical threshold ( ). No negative FC was found in any of the studied groups. Similarly to FC, high ALFF values were found in the GM, primarily in the precuneus/PCC and in the mPFC. \n   Functional connectivity and amplitude of low frequency fluctuations group results.  \nGroup-level   t  -statistic maps showing significantly detectable FC (upper panel) and ALFF (lower panel) in the full-band frequency range. The three groups of subjects, HC, MCI and AD patients, are reported from left to right. Hot and cold colors encode for positive and negative group effect, respectively. Results were obtained via one-sample, two-tailed, t-tests (|t| > 3.7; p<0.05, corrected). Of note, despite it is expected to find negative ALFF values in white matter [ ], this effect was striking in our results and it is primarily caused by the CompCor approach for noise mitigation [ ].

R, right; L, left. \n  \nGroup averages of FC z-score in the GM ( ) showed a significantly reduced connectivity in both AD and MCI patients compared to HC (two-sample, two-tailed t-tests: HC vs AD, t = 2.8, p < 0.05; HC vs MCI, t = 2.2, p < 0.05; MCI vs AD, t = 1.0, p > 0.3). On the contrary, group averages of ALFF z-scores in the GM mask ( ) revealed no significant differences among groups (one-way ANOVA test: f = 0.04, p > 0.9). Voxel-wise one-way ANOVA and relative post-hoc analyses of FC and ALFF corroborated these whole-brain trends among groups ( ). \n   Average grey matter functional connectivity and amplitude of low frequency fluctuations.  \nBoth measures were extracted from a common grey matter mask. This mask was obtained averaging grey matter probability maps (from the segmentation step) across all subjects and thresholding the resulting map at 0.75. (A) Group average FC z-score. Diseased groups show significant reduction compared to HC. (B) Group average ALFF z-score. No significant difference among groups were found. In particular, MCI and AD are indistinguishable from healthy subjects (p > 0.8 and p > 0.7, respectively). * p < 0.05 (two-sample, two-tailed   t  -test). \n  \nHaving confirmed previous results on the overall spatial distribution of FC and ALFF in healthy controls and patients, we next examined the results of the linear regression between FC and ALFF within each group. Brain regions in which the correlation strength was significantly explained by the amplitude of oscillations in HC are shown in   for each considered frequency band. For the full-band range, these areas included the cingulate cortex and precuneus, the superior temporal cortex/insula, the medial frontal cortex, the thalamus, the lentiform nucleus and the parahippocampal cortex ( , top). Common patterns for the slow-5 and slow-4 bands ( , middle and bottom, respectively) were found in the cingulate cortex and precuneus. The slow-5 band showed also additional FC vs ALFF correlation patterns in the superior temporal cortex/insula, while the slow-4 band showed some lateralized (right) subcortical effect (thalamus, lentiform nucleus). All the regions reported above showed a positive relationship between FC and ALFF. One region only, located in left cerebellum, showed a negative association between FC and ALFF, which was isolated to the slow-4 band. However, since the cerebellum barely fell in the bottom edge of EPI field, the area showed a lower signal to noise ratio and suboptimal normalization when compared to the cerebrum. Therefore, this negative correlation is likely due to artifacts. Remarkably, in contrast to HC, neither AD nor MCI did show any area with significant regression between FC and ALFF (p > 0.05 cor.). \n   Voxel-wise correlation between functional connectivity and amplitude of low frequency fluctuations in the healthy brain.  \nColor-coded t-statistic maps showing significantly detectable correlation between FC and ALFF for the full-band (upper panel), slow-5 (middle panel) and slow-4 (bottom panel) frequency range, considering only the HC group.

The numbers next to the images refer to z coordinates in the MNI space. R, right; L, left. \n  \nWe then investigated the specific effect of disease in those areas showing significant FC vs ALFF correlation in healthy subjects (i.e., between-group comparisons in areas shown in  ). This analysis demonstrated the local effect of disease on the strength of the FC vs ALFF coupling (  left, AD patients;   right, MCI patients). Specific cluster locations resulting from t-test HC vs AD and HC vs MCI are reported in Tables   and  , respectively. No significant patterns resulted from the comparison of AD vs MCI (p > 0.05 cor.). \n   Pathology-induced changes in the coupling between functional connectivity and the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations.  \nColor-coded t-statistic maps showing significantly detectable changes in the correlation between FC and ALFF comparing HC to AD patients (left) and MCI patients (right).

Only the brain areas in which was found a statistically significant relationship in HC were considered in these tests (i.e., t-maps masked with patterns in  ). Results were obtained via t-contrasts (HC > AD and HC > MCI) in the \u201cFC vs ALFF\u201d model (|t| > 2.8; p < 0.05, corrected).

Regional differences in the FC vs ALFF coupling comparing HC to MCI.        \nFinally, to assess the origin of the reduced correlation between FC and ALFF, their values were averaged over each of the ROIs reported in Tables   and  . We found several ROIs showing a significant reduction of FC in patients as compared to HC; on the contrary, no ROIs showed either a significant reduction in ALFF or any other clear trend ( ). Finally, according to their location the voxels included in all the ROIs were classified as cortical or subcortical, and ALFF and FC values were averaged subject by subject in these two macro-areas. In both macro-areas, and for the full-band frequency range, there was a disruption of the correlation between FC and ALFF in AD compared to HC ( , left plots). In both, cortical ( ) and subcortical ( ) regions, a significant reduction in FC, but not in ALFF, was proportional to the drop in correlation between these two measures. All other tests (i.e., in other frequency bands and including the MCI group) showed a similar trend towards reduction of FC, although they did not reach the full statistical significance. \n   Trend of functional connectivity vs amplitude of low frequency fluctuations along with respective averaged values.  \nFC and ALFF values were averaged in the significant clusters resulting from t-contrast HC vs AD in the full-band analysis (i.e.,  , top row, left column).

For the details of the regions, see  . * p < 0.05 (two-sample, one-tailed t-test). \n  \n\n## Discussion \n  \n### FC vs ALFF in healthy population \n  \nThe present study revealed specific spatial and frequency-dependent patterns of positive regression coefficients between global FC and ALFF in healthy subjects ( ). Involved regions can be assembled in three main groups, namely temporal, parietal and subcortical areas. Results demonstrated that these brain areas are characterized by voxels whose levels of oscillation amplitude are directly associated to the strength of their global connection. Interestingly, many of these areas are known to belong to the most globally connected regions of the brain. For example, the cingulate cortex belongs to the DMN, which is characterized by a high degree of functional [ ] and anatomical [ ] connections. Similarly, the insula, thalamus and basal ganglia are implicated in several long range connections [ ,  ,  ]. These results suggest therefore that highly connected regions in the brain are also regions whose connectivity is more sensitive to variations of the underlying fluctuation amplitude. \n\nOur results in the full frequency band are broadly consistent with those obtained by Di and colleagues, even though we did not find any negative correlation pattern (with the exception of the cerebellum, as discussed in the results section) [ ]. However, while Di and colleagues adopted the ICA and seed-based analysis to compute FC, we privileged a voxel-wise global measure of connectivity which is independent from a specific network decided a priori. This means that FC can be directly and unequivocally compared with ALFF in each voxel. Accordingly, our results demonstrate that FC vs ALFF coupling is network independent and may be regarded as global characteristic of each single voxel. \n\nThe separation of LFFs in two distinct frequency ranges (slow-5 and slow-4) demonstrated that the relationship between ALFF and FC is sensitive to the frequency range, and specific patterns of correlation could be identified for slow-5 and slow-4 bands. Although the full-band analysis returned essentially the same areas highlighted by the sub-band analysis, the slow-5 band was clearly more sensitive for couplings in temporal lobe regions. Moreover, slow-5 primarily identified cortical regions, while slow-4 included both cortical and subcortical regions. These results are in agreement with recent studies, which reported that the fluctuations at the higher bound of LFFs are mainly localized in subcortical areas [ ,  ]. The different patterns are likely due to the different oscillatory mechanisms underlying these two frequency bands. Previous works suggested that the limited speed of signal propagation, primarily due to synaptic delay and axonal conduction, along with physical constraints (i.e., the size) of the engaged neuronal network may account for the different periods of oscillation. Under this assumption, large neuronal assemblies may result in a larger period of electrophysiological oscillation if compared to small neuronal space [ ,  ]. Thus, according to this view the relative large size of cortical as compared to subcortical structures might explain the different patterns observed at different bands. Alternatively, the different coupling in slow-4 and slow-5 bands could arise from different synaptic, functional or cytoarchitectonic features of the different areas [ ,  ]. Nonetheless, it still remains largely unclear how the BOLD signal depends on the spontaneous neuronal activity observed at different spatiotemporal scales. Moreover, the frequency window of BOLD signal for the slow-5 and slow-4 components is seemingly too narrow for discriminating between different frequency/size features of neuronal assemblies. \n\nA higher fluctuation amplitude in slow-4 as compared to slow-5 has been observed with a symmetrical pattern in the basal ganglia [ ]. In contrast, we found here a lateralization of the FC vs ALFF coupling in slow-4 band of subcortical areas. Since the coupling in those regions was symmetrically preserved in the full-band analysis, slow-4 lateralization pattern might be due to a suboptimal spectral division [ ]. Indeed, the use of poorer information (nearly half of the spectrum) as well as the higher amount of noise which is present at lower frequencies, may result in a reduced statistical power. \n\nBoth the spatial specificity and the frequency dependence of the coupling between FC and ALFF suggest that the latter measure plays an active role in the generation of synchronization patterns and it is not a simple prerequisite for the emergence of FC. Indeed, the amplitude of BOLD low frequency fluctuations is of physiological relevance, as indicated by many works reporting a coupling between electrophysiological signals and spontaneous BOLD LFFs [ \u2013 ]. ALFF was also found to be linearly related to the metabolic consumption of glucose [ ]. Moreover, the reduction of low-frequency EEG power from childhood to adulthood, a well-known feature of brain maturation, is accompanied by concurrent reductions in spontaneous BOLD power [ ]. Spontaneous BOLD fluctuations were also reported to account for inter-trial variability in behavior [ ] and to be more capable than FC in discriminating between different resting conditions (e.g., eyes-open vs eyes-closed) [ ]. This evidence suggests that the magnitude of fluctuations provides information on the neuronal workload of the underlying brain area. In this context, the FC vs ALFF correlation pattern we reported here is likely to have a physiological meaning, by expressing local neuronal activity and local strength of global connectivity together. \n\nOn the other hand, a non-neuronal origin of the FC vs ALFF pattern cannot be excluded a priori. In principle, a common source of physiological noise could also account for their positive correlation pattern. Cardiac and respiratory fluctuations, spontaneous oscillation in carbon dioxide, and many other physiological phenomena have been identified or proposed as source of BOLD fluctuations [ \u2013 ]. For example, ALFF has been shown to correlate with BOLD response in breath holding (BH) task, suggesting that the spectral amplitude of LFFs might be used to scale task-related BOLD signal to account for variability in vascular reactivity [ ,  ]. However, previously reported regions of high correlation between ALFF and BH-BOLD response (e.g., cerebellum, midbrain, inferior occipital gyrus, PCC and precuneus) are only minimally overlapped to the correlation pattern that we observed in the current work. This suggests phenomena like vascular reactivity may have only marginally contributed to our results [ ]. \n\n\n### FC vs ALFF in degenerative dementia \n  \nThe comparison between patients and healthy controls revealed a widespread reduction of the FC vs ALFF coupling, at all frequency bands and in both patient groups, AD and MCI ( ). Additionally, such a disruption of correlation patterns was primarily due to a reduction in FC, i.e. loss of fluctuation synchronization rather than to a change in ALFF, in both cortical and subcortical areas ( ). \n\nDifferent works have reported decreased FC in AD and MCI patients with both seed-based and data driven-analyses [ ], especially in the hippocampus, PCC and ACC [ ]. These findings are consistent with the reduction trend across groups we reported here in the average GM FC ( ), as well as shown in voxel-level analysis ( ). Conversely, we did not observe any significant trend of ALFF values either in the GM ( ) or in the voxel-level analysis ( ), except for a small lateralized frontal region with reduced ALFF in both AD and MCI patients. Several works have reported a heterogeneous set of brain regions with abnormal, either increased or decreased, ALFF values in dementia [ ,  ,  ,  ], which may reflect the progression of the pathology [ ]. Altogether, our and other results support the existence of a complex relationship between AD pathology, neuronal excitability and the underlying vascular and metabolic variables, possibly in a region-dependent manner ([ ], and references therein). \n\nWe observed that the normal pattern of correlations between FC and ALFF ( ) is disrupted in patients with MCI and AD. Strikingly, in those regions where the correlation FC vs ALFF is altered in patients compared to controls, this phenomenon is related to a loss of synchrony of the oscillations in the presence of preserved oscillation amplitude ( ). This finding indicates that changes of ALFF and FC induced by pathology are partially disentangled, possibly reflecting distinct pathophysiological phenomena. Moreover, our results suggest that the dementia-related changes primarily affect the synchronization of LFFs rather than the oscillation amplitude. \n\nThe anatomical pattern of significant FC vs ALFF coupling observed in HC was found to be disrupted as an effect of AD pathology, as shown by group comparisons. Moreover, when considering the overall FC vs ALFF uncoupling, such a disruption was already detectable at the stage of MCI, indicating such a parameter to be sensitive to early pathophysiological aspects of the disease. Further studies on larger populations are needed to clarify the potential diagnostic value of this biomarker. It is possible that the involved regions could have a key role for the maintenance of the ongoing activity (as it is suggested by their partially overlap with the DMN). In the pathological brain, these key regions could be forced to maintain a normal level of activity that, due to the disease, does not produce a comparable degree of synchronization with other brain regions. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe present resting-state fMRI study revealed that ALFF is linearly related to FC in spatially segregated patterns that are consistent in a healthy elderly population. This relationship is dependent on the specific range of frequencies within the low-frequency band explored in FC studies. The relationship between FC and ALFF is disrupted in AD as well as MCI, in all the studied frequency bands. According to our findings, this is likely due to a loss of fluctuation synchrony among the involved brain areas rather than to altered local activity. \n\nIn conclusion, this study suggests that the correlation patterns between ALFF and FC have a neurophysiological correlate, but that ALFF and FC convey partially distinct information, especially as far as the development of changes induced by pathology is involved. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4386762, "text_md5": "ba28f4c3f475a30429c781d88cf27423", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 172], "journal": [173, 181], "publication_year": [183, 187], "title": [198, 375], "keywords": [389, 389], "abstract": [402, 1905], "body": [1914, 35251]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 25844531, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0120988", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4386762", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4386762"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4386762\">4386762</a>", "list_title": "PMC4386762  Intrinsic Patterns of Coupling between Correlation and Amplitude of Low-Frequency fMRI Fluctuations Are Disrupted in Degenerative Dementia Mainly due to Functional Disconnection"}

A first step to understanding consciousness is to define what it is not. To this end, anaesthesia combined with functional neuroimaging provides a powerful approach for studying the brain mechanisms that change as consciousness fades (Demertzi et al.,\u00a0 ; Luppi et al.,\u00a0 ; MacDonald et al.,\u00a0 ; Mashour & Hudetz,\u00a0 ; Naci et al.,\u00a0 ; Pal et al.,\u00a0 ; Sarasso et al.,\u00a0 ; Stamatakis et al.,\u00a0 ; Varley et al.,\u00a0 ; Vatansever et al.,\u00a0 ), and, conversely, that are necessary for realizing human consciousness. Anaesthesia has been used for over 150\u2009years to reversibly abolish consciousness in clinical medicine, but its effect can vary substantially between individuals. At moderate dosages, the intended suppression of behavioural responsiveness is highly variable (Bola et al.,\u00a0 ; Chennu et al.,\u00a0 ), and at deep anaesthesia dosages, in rare cases (0.1\u20130.2%; Mashour & Avidan,\u00a0 ; Sandin et al.,\u00a0 ), individuals retain conscious awareness, also known as \u201cunintended intraoperative awareness\u201d (Mashour & Avidan,\u00a0 ; Pandit et al.,\u00a0 ; Sanders et al.,\u00a0 ; Sandin et al.,\u00a0 ). A much higher percentage of patients presumed to be unconscious during general anaesthesia (22%; Leslie et al.,\u00a0 ) may have subjective experiences, such as dreaming. The brain bases of this considerable inter\u2010individual effect variability remain poorly understood. \n\nA key and mostly overlooked question is what these individual differences (Palanca et al.,\u00a0 ; Searle & Hopkins,\u00a0 ) can reveal about the unravelling of conscious cognition as consciousness falters during anaesthesia. Propofol is the most common anaesthetic agent in clinical interventions that require the reversible suppression of consciousness. Two recent electroencephalography (EEG) studies that measured variable behavioural responsiveness during mild and moderate propofol anaesthesia reported that the participants' varying levels of responsiveness were differentiated by alpha band connectivity during wakefulness (Chennu et al.,\u00a0 ), and changing patterns of EEG signal diversity from wakefulness to moderate sedation (Bola et al.,\u00a0 ). However, the brain regional\u2010 or network\u2010bases for this substantial individual variability (Palanca et al.,\u00a0 ; Searle & Hopkins,\u00a0 ), and its potential link to cognitive function, remain unknown. Propofol\u2010induced sedation produces selective metabolic impairment and reduces brain activity bilaterally in frontal and parietal associative regions (Alkire & Miller,\u00a0 ; Baars et al.,\u00a0 ; Boly et al.,\u00a0 ; Fiset et al.,\u00a0 ; Plourde et al.,\u00a0 ; Witon et al.,\u00a0 ; for a review, see MacDonald et al.,\u00a0 ; but see Pal et al.,\u00a0 ). Therefore, three brain networks with frontal and parietal lobe distribution, the dorsal attention network (DAN), executive control network (ECN), and default mode network (DMN) are primary candidate sources of individual variability under propofol sedation. \n\nThe DAN and ECN, distributed laterally across frontal and parietal lobes, are key to orchestrating stimulus\u2010driven and goal\u2010directed cognition (Corbetta & Shulman,\u00a0 ; Duncan,\u00a0 ; Elliott,\u00a0 ; Kroger et al.,\u00a0 ; Shallice,\u00a0 ). The DMN extends partially in lateral and medial frontal and parietal lobes and is involved in internally oriented cognition (Andrews\u2010Hanna et al.,\u00a0 ; Beer,\u00a0 ; Buckner et al.,\u00a0 ; D'Argembeau et al.,\u00a0 ; Gusnard et al.,\u00a0 ; Schneider et al.,\u00a0 ; Wicker et al.,\u00a0 ), but also external environment monitoring (Buckner et al.,\u00a0 ; Hahn et al.,\u00a0 ; Spreng et al.,\u00a0 ; Vatansever et al.,\u00a0 ) and shifts in contextually relevant information (Smith et al.,\u00a0 ). The DAN, ECN, and DMN are selectively impaired during loss of consciousness across conditions, for example, under anaesthesia and after severe brain injury (Luppi et al.,\u00a0 ; Naci et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nFurthermore, the DAN/ECN and the DMN display an antagonistic relationship (Fox et al.,\u00a0 ; Fransson,\u00a0 ; Huang et al.,\u00a0 ) during spontaneous thought and goal\u2010directed cognition. During conditions that engage external attention, the reduction of functional activity in the DMN (Greicius et al.,\u00a0 ; Raichle et al.,\u00a0 ; Shulman et al.,\u00a0 ), is concomitant with an increase of activity in the DAN and ECN (Dosenbach et al.,\u00a0 ; Fox et al.,\u00a0 ; Seeley et al.,\u00a0 ; Sridharan et al.,\u00a0 ). The anticorrelation between these is related to individual differences in performance variability (Kelly et al.,\u00a0 ), and directly supports sustained attention (Kucyi et al.,\u00a0 ). Conversely, this antagonistic relationship breaks down in state\u2010related manipulations of consciousness, such as during sleep (Tagliazucchi et al.,\u00a0 ), anaesthesia (Bonhomme et al.,\u00a0 ; Boveroux et al.,\u00a0 ), and severe brain injury (Boly et al.,\u00a0 ; Haugg et al.,\u00a0 ). Despite this accumulating evidence for the key and interrelated roles of the DAN, ECN, and DMN in supporting conscious cognition (Demertzi et al.,\u00a0 ; Huang et al.,\u00a0 ; Vanhaudenhuyse et al.,\u00a0 ), and their primacy as target sites of propofol\u2010induced sedation, their roles in individual differences under anaesthesia have not been previously investigated. \n\nTo address this gap, in two studies, we tested whether variability or impairments in functional connectivity (FC) within and between the DAN, ECN, and DMN underlie individual differences in responsiveness during propofol anaesthesia. To directly investigate their individual and joint roles, in a first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we scanned healthy participants (  N  \u00a0=\u00a017) during wakefulness and during the administration of propofol at dosages of \u201cmoderate anaesthesia,\u201d expressly aimed at engendering individual differences. Variability in behavioural responsiveness in each state was assessed with an auditory target detection task prior to scanning. To test whether any individual differences in responsiveness were related to differences in perceptual or high\u2010level attention processes that were invisible to the clinical sedation scale (Ramsay et al.,\u00a0 ), participants were scanned during an active listening condition comprised of a brief (5\u00a0min) engaging auditory narrative, and during the condition of rs. In a second behavioural study, we assessed the high\u2010level attention demands of narrative understanding in an independent behavioural group (  N  \u00a0=\u00a025) and related them to the brain activity of participants who underwent scanning. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \n#### Study 1 \n  \nHealthy participants for the fMRI anaesthesia study (  N  \u00a0=\u00a017; 18\u201340\u2009years; 13 males) were tested in the MRI scanner at the Robarts Research Institute, Western University, in Canada. Ethical approval was obtained from the Health Sciences Research Ethics Board and Psychology Research Ethics Board of Western University. \n\n\n#### Study 2 \n  \nAn independent group of healthy participants (  N  \u00a0=\u00a025; 18\u201340\u2009years; 7 males) were tested behaviourally at the Global Brain health Institute at Trinity College Dublin, in Ireland. Ethical approval was obtained from the School of Psychology Research Ethics Board, Trinity College Dublin. All healthy participants were right\u2010handed, native English speakers, had self\u2010reported normal hearing and no history of neurological disorders. Informed consent was obtained for each participant prior to the experiment. \n\n\n\n### Stimuli and design \n  \n#### Study 1 \n  \nThe study comprised a structural scan at the start, followed by two experimental sessions, one during wakefulness and the other during moderate anaesthesia, each with the same design. At the start of each session, a clinical assessment of sedation (Ramsay et al.,\u00a0 ) was conducted to confirm wakefulness or moderate anaesthesia. Subsequently, a behavioural task, and two fMRI acquisitions, (a) a free listening to an auditory narrative (same in both sessions) and (b) an rs scan, were conducted in each session. Listening to plot\u2010driven narratives is naturally engaging, requires minimal behavioural collaboration from participants, and therefore, is highly suitable for testing perceptual or high\u2010level attention processes independently of behavioural output or eye opening (Naci et al.,\u00a0 ; Naci et al.,\u00a0 ), which are impaired in moderate anaesthesia. Due to design constrains, the rs scan followed the auditory target detection task and the narrative scan, and spontaneous thought in the rs may have been influenced by these preceding activities. However, as this study's primary question did not concern the rs, this is not a substantive limitation. The data analysed here was collected as part of a larger study, and the wakefulness data have previously been reported in relation to deep anaesthesia (Naci et al.,\u00a0 ). See below for full protocol details. \n\n##### Behavioural testing \n  \n Auditory target detection task  . Before commencing the scanning for either session, participants were asked to perform a computerized auditory target detection task (50 trials), which aimed to assess individual responsiveness differences during moderate anaesthesia. fMRI was not acquired during this task. Sound was presented with the Sensimetrics (S14;  ) headphones. A volume level deemed comfortable by each individual was determined prior to testing and used for the duration of the experiment. Participants were instructed to press a button with their index finger as soon as they heard an auditory beep (1200\u2009Hz, 100\u2009ms duration, 10\u2009ms ramps) and to keep their eyes on the fixation cross on the screen. Participant had up to 3000\u2009ms to make a response. Once a response was made, a pause of 1500\u2009ms occurred prior to the presentation of the next stimulus. The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA)\u00a0=\u00a0min [reaction time (RT), 3000\u2009ms]\u2009+\u20091500\u2009ms. The SOA was jittered by virtue of variable RTs between trials. To ensure the participant did not lose contact with the response box during moderate anaesthesia, the response box was attached securely to their dominant hand. Individual and group RTs were used for behavioural analyses. \n\n\n##### MRI testing \n  \nInside the MRI scanner, participants underwent two functional scans during wakefulness and moderate anaesthesia. A plot\u2010driven auditory narrative (5\u00a0min) was presented over MRI compatible noise cancelation headphones (Sensimetrics, S14;  ). Participants were asked to simply listen with eyes closed. The narrative comprised a highly engaging auditory excerpt from the movie \u201cTaken\u201d depicting dramatic events, where a young girl travelling abroad without her family is kidnapped while speaking on the phone to her father. The same narrative was presented during wakefulness and moderate anaesthesia. A similar eyes\u2010closed, rs condition (8\u00a0min) was also acquired in each state for comparison with the narrative condition. \n\n\n##### Sedation procedure \n  \nThe level of sedation was measured with the Ramsay clinical sedation scale for each participant by three independent assessors (two anaesthesiologists and one anaesthesia nurse) in person inside the scanner room. Before entering the fMRI scanner, a 20G I.V. cannula was inserted into a vein on the dorsum of the nondominant hand of the participants. The propofol infusion system was connected to the cannula prior to the first scanning session. No propofol was administered during the wakeful session. Participants were fully wakeful, alert and communicated appropriately (Ramsay 1) and wakefulness (eye opening) was monitored with an infrared camera placed inside the scanner. At the commencement of the moderate anaesthesia session, intravenous propofol was administered with a Baxter AS 50 (Singapore). An effect\u2010site/plasma steering algorithm was used combined with the computer\u2010controlled infusion pump to achieve step\u2010wise increments in the sedative effect of Propofol. This infusion pump was manually adjusted to achieve the desired levels of sedation, guided by targeted concentrations of Propofol, as predicted by the TIVA Trainer (the European Society for Intravenous Anaesthesia, eurosiva.eu) pharmacokinetic simulation program. The pharmacokinetic model provided target\u2010controlled infusion by adjusting infusion rates of Propofol over time to achieve and maintain the target blood concentrations as specified by the Marsh 3 compartment algorithm for each participant, as incorporated in the TIVA Trainer software (Marsh et al.,\u00a0 ). In accordance with the Canadian Anaesthesia Society guidelines, noninvasive blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO ) and end\u2010tidal carbon dioxide were monitored continuously through the use of a dedicated MR compatible anaesthesia monitor. Complete resuscitation equipment was present throughout the testing. \n\nPropofol infusion commenced with a target effect\u2010site concentration of 0.6\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and oxygen was titrated to maintain SpO  above 96%. Throughout sedation, participants remained capable of spontaneous cardiovascular function and ventilation. Supplemental oxygen was administered via nasal cannulae to ensure adequate levels of oxygen at all times. If the Ramsay level was lower than 3 for moderate sedation, the concentration was slowly increased by increments of 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg/ml with repeated assessments of responsiveness between increments to obtain a Ramsay score of 3. During administration of propofol, participants generally became calm and slowed in their response to verbal communication. Once participants stopped engaging in spontaneous conversation, and speech became sluggish, they were classified as being at Ramsey level 3. Nevertheless, when asked via loud verbal communication, participants agreed to perform the auditory target detection task as would be expected at Ramsey level 3. A brief recall task was adopted from the Mini Mental State Exam (Folstein et al.,\u00a0 ), as a behavioural test complimentary to the anaesthesiologists' assessments of whether sedation commensurate with Ramsay level 3 had been achieved. At the start of each session (wakefulness/moderate anaesthesia sessions), the researcher named three different sets of unrelated objects clearly and slowly and asked the participant to name each of them. The participant was instructed to remember the words in order to be able to repeat them in a short while. For 10\u00a0min following the word presentation, the participant was allowed to rest and performed no other task/was not exposed to any experimental stimuli. Subsequently, the participant was asked to repeat the words. Two different lists (a. Ball\u2010Flag\u2010Tree; b. Flower\u2010Egg\u2010Rope), counterbalanced across participants, were used to avoid familiarity effects between the wakefulness and moderate anaesthesia states. As expected, during the wakefulness session, all participants correctly repeated all three words, whereas during the moderate anaesthesia session, performance was varied with participants sluggishly repeating one or more of the words, consistent with Ramsay level 3 sedation. During moderate anaesthesia (Ramsey 3), the mean estimated effect\u2010site propofol concentration, as provided by the TIVA Trainer software, was 1.99 (1.59\u20132.39) \u03bcg/ml and the mean estimated plasma propofol concentration was 2.02 (1.56\u20132.48) \u03bcg/ml. \n\n\n\n#### Study 2 \n  \nTo provide a subjective measure of attention during the same story, an independent behavioural group of participants that did not undergo scanning, rated how \u201csuspenseful\u201d this story was every 2\u00a0s, from \u201cleast\u201d (1) to \u201cmost suspenseful\u201d (9). The audio excerpt was divided into 156 clips, each 2\u00a0s long to match the repetition time (TR, 2\u00a0s) used in the independent participant group from Study 1 (who underwent MRI scanning at the Robarts Research Institute, at Western University, in Canada). Participants heard the stimuli through over\u2010ear headphones connected to the stimulus presentation computer and used the keyboard to record responses, in a sound\u2010isolated laboratory at the Global Brain Health Institute, at Trinity College Dublin, in Ireland. Participants had up to 3000\u2009ms to make a response, at which point the next sequential clip began immediately. At the end of the experiment, participants indicated via a feedback questionnaire that the interruptions did not disrupt the coherence of the story's plot and their perception of suspense throughout. \n\n\n\n### Data analyses \n  \n#### Study 1 \n  \n##### Analysis of behavioural data \n  \nAs responses beyond 3000\u2009ms were not monitored, for the purposes of behavioural analyses, we considered participants who did not respond within 3000\u2009ms during anaesthesia as very delayed in their response time rather as missing data points. Participants were awake and responsive but very sluggish, consistent with moderate anaesthesia/Ramsay level 3 designation, and, therefore, it is very likely that responses were made outside the 3000\u2009ms window. Individual\u2010level differences in RTs of the target detection task between wakefulness and moderate anaesthesia sessions were assessed by independent samples t\u2010tests. The rate of RT change from baseline was calculated as follows: [(RT during anaesthesia\u2009\u2212\u2009RT during wakefulness)/RT during wakefulness]\u2009\u00d7\u2009100. The hit rate was calculated as the number of responses divided by the number of trials for wakefulness and moderate anaesthesia separately. The Mahalanobis distance was computed to detect outliers in our multivariate data set (Hadi,\u00a0 ), comprised of the rate of RT change from baseline and hit rate during anaesthesia. Participants were considered outliers if their robust Mahalanobis distance from the rest of the distribution was significant at   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.01. \n\n\n##### MRI data acquisition \n  \nFunctional images were obtained on a 3\u00a0T Siemens Prisma system, with a 32\u2010channel head coil. The high\u2010resolution brain structural images were acquired using a T1\u2010weighted 3D MPRAGE sequence with the following parameters, voxel size: 1\u00a0\u00d7\u20091\u00a0\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm, TA\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0min, and 38\u2009s, echo time (TE)\u00a0=\u00a04.25\u2009ms, matrix size\u00a0=\u00a0240\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009192, flip angle (FA)\u00a0=\u00a09\u00b0. The functional echo\u2010planar images (EPI) were obtained with the following parameters, 33 slices, voxel size: 3\u00a0\u00d7\u20093\u00a0\u00d7\u20093, inter\u2010slice gap of 25%, TR\u00a0=\u00a02000\u2009ms, TE\u00a0=\u00a030\u2009ms, matrix size\u00a0=\u00a064\u2009\u00d7\u200964, FA\u00a0=\u00a075\u00b0. The audio narrative and rs had 155 and 256 scans, respectively. \n\n\n\n####  MRI   preprocessing \n  \n##### Functional data preprocessing \n  \nStandard preprocessing procedures and data analyses were performed with SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping; Wellcome Institute of Cognitive Neurology,  ) and the AA pipeline software (Cusack et al.,\u00a0 ). In the preprocessing pipeline, we performed slice timing correction, motion correction, registration to structural images, normalization to a template brain, and smoothing. The data were smoothed with a Gaussian smoothing kernel of 10\u2009mm FWHM (Peigneux et al.,\u00a0 ). Spatial normalization was performed using SPM8's segment\u2010and\u2010normalize procedure, whereby the T1 structural was segmented into grey and white matter and normalized to a segmented MNI\u2010152 template. These normalization parameters were then applied to all EPIs. The time series in each voxel was high\u2010pass\u2010filtered with a cutoff of 1/128\u2009Hz to remove low\u2010frequency noise, and scaled to a grand mean of 100 across voxels and scans in each session. Prior to analyses, the first five scans of each session were discarded to achieve T1 equilibrium and to allow participants to adjust to the noise of the scanner. To avoid the formation of artificial anticorrelations (Anderson et al.,\u00a0 ; Murphy et al.,\u00a0 ), we performed no global signal regression. \n\n\n##### Structural data preprocessing \n  \nThe brain structural images were processed using FreeSurfer package ( ), a well\u2010documented automated program which is widely used to perform surface\u2010based morphometric analysis (Dale et al.,\u00a0 ). The processing steps include: (1) removing the nonbrain tissue; (2) transforming the skull\u2010stripping brain volume to Talairach\u2010like space; (3) segmenting brain tissues to GM, WM, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); (4) performing intensity normalization to remove the effect of bias field; (5) building a surface tessellation to generate a triangular cortical mesh consisting of about 300,000 vertices in the whole brain surface; (6) correcting topological deficits of cortical surface; and (7) deforming brain surface to generate optimized models of GM/WM and GM/CSF boundaries. \n\n\n\n#### Analyses of fMRI data \n  \nGroup\u2010level correlational analyses explored, for each voxel, the cross\u2010subject synchronization of brain activity by measuring the correlation of each participant's time\u2010course with the mean time\u2010course of all other participants (Naci et al.,\u00a0 ; Naci et al.,\u00a0 ; Naci et al.,\u00a0 ). Further, to investigate whether the behavioural variability under anaesthesia related to perceptual or higher\u2010order processing differences among participants, we performed two mixed data\u2010driven and model\u2010based analyses. First, we extracted the sound envelope of the auditory narrative via the MATLAB   MIR  toolbox ( ) and built a generalised linear model by using statistical parametric mapping to derive auditory characteristic\u2010related brain activation for each individual. Subsequently, the z\u2010scored average suspense ratings of the narrative obtained by the independent group of participants in study 2 (see SI) were used as a regressor in the fMRI data of individuals who underwent propofol anaesthesia in study 1, to measure the neural correlates of perceptual or high\u2010level attention processes during the narrative condition. The regressors were generated by convolving boxcar functions with the canonical hemodynamic response function (Friston et al.,\u00a0 ). For the task activation analyses, head movement was accounted for by regressing out the six motion parameters at the individual level. Included in the general linear model were nuisance variables, comprising the movement parameters in the three directions of motion and three degrees of rotation, as well as a constant (all\u2010ones vector) that served to regress out the session mean. (Additional analyses of motion showed no significant differences between participants groups. See Table\u00a0 .) Fixed\u2010effect analyses were performed in each subject, corrected for temporal auto\u2010correlation using an AR (1)\u2009+\u2009white noise model. Linear contrasts were used to obtain subject\u2010specific estimates for each effect of interest. Linear contrast coefficients for each participant were entered into the second level random\u2010effects analysis. Clusters or voxels that survived at   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05 threshold, corrected for multiple comparisons with the family\u2010wise error (FWE) were considered statistically significant. For thresholding at the cluster level, an uncorrected cluster forming voxel threshold of   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.001 was used. \n\nTo test whether individual differences under anaesthesia related to inherent brain features independent from the propofol sedation, we investigated the FC between and within the three networks during wakefulness, and in sedation. FC within and between the DAN, ECN, and DMN was assessed by computing the Pearson correlation of the fMRI time courses between 19 regions of interests (ROIs; spherical, 10\u2009mm diameter) (from Raichle,\u00a0 ) constituting these different brain networks, as identified by rs studies (Table\u00a0 ). This parcellation method is theoretically driven based on meta\u2010analyses of these three particular networks, and, furthermore, helps to relate our current findings to our previous findings based on the same parcellation method (Haugg et al.,\u00a0 ; Naci et al.,\u00a0 ). Permutation (1000 times) tests were used to explore FC difference between conditions and were false discovery rate (FDR) corrected for multiple comparisons. Independent analyses considered the contribution of signals from the white matter and CSF to FC (Table\u00a0 ). All of the analyses were conducted using Fisher z\u2010transformed correlation (Pearson   r  ). Glass's delta was used to compute the effect size of the comparison between wakeful and moderate anaesthesia states, because of the different standard deviations of the two states, while Hedges'   g   was used to compute the effect size of the comparison between fast and slow participants because of the different sample sizes for the two groups. \n  \nOverview of selected regions of interests for the three functional networks \n    \n\n#### Grey matter volume analyses \n  \nTo test whether individual differences under anaesthesia related to inherent brain features independent from the propofol sedation, we also tested grey matter volume differences across participants. Vertex\u2010wise grey matter volume (GMV) was computed (Winkler et al.,\u00a0 ) and smoothed with a 10\u2010mm full\u2010width at half maximum Gaussian kernel to perform the statistics. Monte Carlo simulation cluster analysis and a cluster\u2010wise threshold of   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05 were adopted for multiple comparisons correction (Hagler Jr et al.,\u00a0 ). Then, averaged GMV values for each significant cluster, for each individual participant, was extracted to perform permutation tests (1000 times) that tested for clusters/regions showing significant GMV differences between fast and slow participants. The FDR method was used to correct for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n#### Study 2 \n  \nTo determine how similar suspense ratings were across the group, the inter\u2010subject correlation of suspense ratings was computed as the average of the Pearson correlations of each participant's data with the mean data from the rest of the group To account for the non\u2010normalized distribution of correlation values (Fisher,\u00a0 ), all statistical analyses were performed on z\u2010transformed correlation values, using Fisher's r\u2010to\u2010z transformation. For visualization purposes, we retransformed these z\u2010values in correlation values. \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### The effect of moderate anaesthesia on behavioural responsiveness \n  \nDespite the same Ramsay 3 clinical score, independently determined by three assessors, we observed significant heterogeneity in the RTs of the auditory detection task (Figure\u00a0 ). Then, 5/17 participants were not delayed significantly relative to their wakeful responses, 9/17 were significantly delayed and had fragmented responses (showing 2\u201340% missing trials), and 3/17 failed to make any responses within the 3000\u2009ms time window (Figure\u00a0 ), despite agreeing to have understood the task instructions and to make responses via the button box affixed to their dominant hand. This large individual variability was at odds with the propofol infusion rates titrated for each participant based on the pharmacokinetic model adjusted for demographic variables (Marsh et al.,\u00a0 ), to maintain stable target blood concentrations consistent with Ramsay 3 sedation level (Ramsay et al.,\u00a0 ). \n  \nBehavioural responses. (a) Reaction times and (b) hit rates during the auditory target detection task in the wakeful (blue) and moderate anaesthesia (orange) states. (c) Multivariate outlier detection based on the robust Mahalanobis distance measure. Green/blue dotted lines depict the significance threshold of   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05/  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.01. For further analyses, participants that showed robust Mahalanobis distance significantly different from the rest at   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.01 (above the blue line) were labelled \u201cslow\u201d participants (  N  \u00a0=\u00a05), whereas the rest (below the blue line) were labelled \u201cfast\u201d participants (  N  \u00a0=\u00a012). The horizontal axis represents each individual (S1\u2013S17\u00a0=\u00a0Subject1\u2013Subject17) \n  \nBased on the rate of RT change from the wakeful baseline and hit rates during anaesthesia (Figure\u00a0 ), multivariate data outlier detection showed that five participants had significantly different robust Mahalanobis distance from the rest (Figure\u00a0 ). On this basis, individuals were divided into two groups for further analyses: \u201cfast\u201d participants (FPs;   N  \u00a0=\u00a012), and \u201cslow\u201d participants (SPs;   N  \u00a0=\u00a05). Individual responsiveness variability was not explained by demographic differences, as suggested by no differences in age (between\u2010samples   t   test,   t  \u00a0=\u00a01.3,   p  \u00a0=\u2009.2) and gender (Fisher's exact test, odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.3,   p  \u00a0=\u00a01) between FPs and SPs. \n\nSubsequently, we tested whether the brain bases of this variability was related to three other factors. (1) Individual variability could be related to underlying differences in perceptual or high\u2010level attention processes, which may have been invisible to the behavioural examination during the Ramsay assessment. (2) Responsiveness differences may be due to inherent connectivity differences prior to sedation, and/or alterations of connectivity due to sedation, within and between the DAN, ECN and DMN networks. (3) Individual responsiveness differences may be related to inherent structural brain differences, which may, in turn, also manifest as differences in FC. In the following analyses, we explored each of these factors in turn. \n\n\n### Perceptual and high\u2010level attention processes and behavioural responsiveness during moderate anaesthesia \n  \nWe investigated whether each individual's sensory\u2010driven auditory perceptual processes, and high\u2010level attention processes during the narrative condition related to their response times during the target detection task. First, we used SPM to model the relationship between the narrative's perceptual properties captured by the sound envelope, and changes in brain activity over time. Then, each individual's brain activity was related to their RTs in the target detection task. The sound envelope predicted brain activity in bilateral auditory cortex and right inferior frontal gyrus during wakefulness (Figure\u00a0 ), which as expected was dramatically reduced in moderate anaesthesia, to one small subthreshold cluster in left auditory cortex (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.05 FWE corrected) (Figure\u00a0 ). We observed no correlation between the participants' RTs in either wakefulness or moderate anaesthesia and the extent of their individual activations in auditory regions (Figure\u00a0 ). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in brain activation between the fast and slow groups for the processing of the sound envelope. \n  \nPerceptual and high\u2010level attention processes during the narrative. At the group level, the sound envelope of the narrative predicted significant (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05; family\u2010wise error [FWE] corrected) clusters in the (a) auditory cortex and right inferior frontal gyrus during wakefulness, and (b) left auditory cortex in moderate anaesthesia (did not reach statistical significance [  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.05 FWE corrected]). (c, d) At the group level, the suspense ratings of the audio narrative predicted significant (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05; FWE corrected) clusters in the (c) auditory attention and salience networks during wakefulness, and (d) auditory attention network during moderate anaesthesia. Red arrows indicate the location of the coronal views with respect to the anterior\u2013posterior dimension. (e\u2013h) The number of voxels in primary auditory regions, auditory attention regions, and salience networks of individual participants that were predicted by the sound envelope and suspense ratings, relative to each individual's reaction time in the target detection task. At the individual level, the sound envelope predicted significant activations in the auditory regions in (e) 14/17 of participants during wakefulness, and (f) 10/17 of participants during moderate anaesthesia. At the individual level, the suspense ratings predicted significant activations in the auditory attention and salience network regions in (g) 17/17 of participants during the wakefulness and (h) 14/17 of participants during moderate anaesthesia. There was no correlation between the perceptual or higher\u2010order processes during the narrative and reaction times, during the target detection task, either in wakefulness (e, g) or in moderate anaesthesia (f, h). AAN, auditory attention network; SN, salience network \n  \nSecond, to investigate differential recruitment of high\u2010level attention processes during the narrative, we used a previously established qualitative measure of the listeners' sustained attention throughout the narrative\u2014the perception of suspense on a moment\u2010by\u2010moment basis (Naci et al.,\u00a0 ,  ). We measured the perception of suspense in Study 2, in an independent group from those who underwent scanning. Suspense ratings throughout the narrative were highly and significantly correlated across individuals (  r  \u00a0=\u2009.90; SE\u00a0=\u00a0.07) (  t  [24]\u00a0=\u00a020.56,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.0001), confirming the similar high\u2010level attention processes, and understanding of the narrative across different individuals. We used SPM to model the relationship between this qualitative measure of the narrative's ongoing high\u2010level attention demands and changes in brain activity over time, during the wakeful and moderate anaesthesia states. At the group level, during wakefulness, suspense ratings significantly (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05; FWE corrected) predicted activity in regions of the auditory attention network (Michalka et al.,\u00a0 ; Naci et al.,\u00a0 ; Tobyne et al.,\u00a0 ) and the salience network (Menon,\u00a0 ; Seeley,\u00a0 ) (Figure\u00a0 ), with clips rated as \u201chighly suspenseful\u201d predicting stronger activity in these networks (Table\u00a0 ). By contrast, during moderate anaesthesia, one small activation cluster was observed (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nCoordinates for activation clusters associated with the perception of suspense during the narrative \n  \nAs previously established (Naci et al.,\u00a0 ,  ,  ), the similarity of the narrative's suspense ratings enabled model\u2010based predictions of the underlying brain activity, from the group data, in a leave\u2010one\u2010out fashion to individual participants. Using this approach, we related the activity in suspense\u2010driven activation clusters for each individual to their respective RTs during the target detection task. No correlation was observed between the participants' activation in the auditory attention and salience networks regions to their RTs (Figure\u00a0 ). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in brain activation between the fast and slow groups for the processing of the narrative suspense. \n\n\n### Network connectivity and behavioural responsiveness during moderate anaesthesia \n  \nWe tested whether alterations in the connectivity within and between the DAN, ECN, and DMN during moderate anaesthesia (Figure\u00a0 , Supplemental Information) was associated with these individual differences (Figure\u00a0 ). In the narrative condition, during wakefulness, FC within the DAN (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.005), within the ECN (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.005), between the DMN and DAN (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05), between DMN and ECN (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05), and between DAN and ECN (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05) differentiated the two response groups, with significantly higher FC for FPs relative to SPs (Figure\u00a0 ). During moderate anaesthesia, FC within the DMN (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05), within the ECN (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05), and between DAN and ECN (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05) differentiated FPs from SPs, with significantly higher FC for FPs relative to SPs (Figure\u00a0 ). In the rs condition, during wakefulness, no differences were observed between FP and SP in any of connectivity types. During moderate anaesthesia, FC within and between the DAN, ECN, and DMN differentiated the two groups (DMN,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05; DAN,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05; ECN,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05; DMN\u2010DAN,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.005; DMN\u2010ECN,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.005; DAN\u2010ECN,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.005), with significantly higher FC for FPs relative to SPs (Figure\u00a0 ). All the above were permutation tests FDR corrected. These results were supported by analyses that considered the whole participant group (  N  \u00a0=\u00a017). We found that the extent of RT change from wakefulness to sedation was significantly associated with FC (a) within the ECN, DMN\u2013DAN and DMN\u2013ECN in the wakeful narrative condition, and (b) within the ECN, DMN\u2013DAN, DMN\u2013ECN, DAN\u2013ECN in the moderate sedation rs (Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nFunctional connectivity differences between fast and slow participants.

DMN, default mode network; DAN, dorsal attention network; ECN, executive control network \n  \nA 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092 ANOVA explored the effects of   condition   (narrative, rs),   state   (wakefulness, moderate anaesthesia), and   response group   (FPs, SPs), and their interactions. We found a main effect of response group (  F  [1,15]\u00a0=\u00a019.1,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.005) that was driven by higher connectivity for FPs, and no effects on condition or state. However, effect size analyses showed higher difference between FPs and SPs in the narrative condition during wakefulness (Hedges'   g  \u00a0=\u00a03.1) over all other conditions, including relative to moderate anaesthesia (Hedges'   g  \u00a0=\u00a01.1), and relative to the rs condition during wakefulness (Hedges'   g  \u00a0=\u00a00.9), and moderate anaesthesia (Hedges'   g  \u00a0=\u00a02.3). \n\n\n### Structural brain differences and behavioural responsiveness during moderate anaesthesia \n  \nNext, we tested whether individual differences in behavioural responsiveness were related to structural brain differences, which may also underlie FC differences. To this end, we performed whole\u2010brain vertex\u2010based comparisons of grey matter volume between FPs and SPs. We found that FPs had uniformly significantly higher grey matter volume relative to the SPs, in two frontal regions, the left superior and dorsolateral frontal cortex (L SFC), including the presupplementary motor area (pre\u2010SMA), and the left rostral middle frontal cortex (L rMFC) (Figure\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). The averaged GMV for each of these two regions were higher for FPs relative to SPs (L SFC,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.0005, L rMFC,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.0005; FDR corrected, Figure\u00a0 ). The opposite effect, that is, higher grey matter for SP than FP, was not observed anywhere in the brain. The L SFC and L rMFC overlapped with the functional ROIs that defined the frontal nodes of the ECN (Table\u00a0 ). Furthermore, when considering the whole participant group (  N  \u00a0=\u00a017), we found that lower RT change from wakefulness to sedation was significantly associated with higher grey matter volume in the L SFC and the L rMFC (Figure\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). These results further supported the FC results above (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nGrey matter volume differences between fast and slow participants. (a) Vertex\u2010wise analysis. Two clusters showed significant between\u2010group difference in grey matter volume (GMV) (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05, Monte Carlo simulation corrected). Colour bar indicates the p\u2010value (\u2010lg(p)). (b) Averaged GMV was extracted for each of the two clusters, and between\u2010group comparisons of the averaged GMV were performed by using permutation tests. ***\u00a0=\u00a0  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.0005 false discovery rate (FDR) corrected for multiple comparisons. L SFC, left superior frontal cortex; L rMFC, left rostral middle frontal cortex \n    \nRegions showing significant grey matter volume difference between fast and slow participants \n    \nWe further tested whether the frontal and parietal aspects of the ECN were differentially involved in individual differences, by a direct comparison of the FC differences between FPs and SPs in the ROIs covering the frontal (dorsal medial PFC, left and right anterior PFC) and parietal (left and right superior parietal cortex) aspects of the ECN separately. A 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092 ANOVA with factors   state   (wakefulness, moderate anaesthesia);   region   (frontal ECN, parietal ECN); and   response group   (FPs, SPs) showed a main effect of region (  F  [1,15]\u00a0=\u00a011.9,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.005), driven by higher connectivity in the parietal aspect of the ECN, and a main effect of group (  F  [1,15]\u00a0=\u00a08.2,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05), driven by higher connectivity in FPs relative to SPs. Direction comparisons between FPs and SPs in frontal and parietal aspects of ECN, showed that FC within the frontal, but not parietal, aspect of the ECN distinguished FPs and SPs during wakefulness and during moderate anaesthesia (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05, FDR corrected) (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nDifferences of functional connectivity in frontal and parietal aspects of executive control network between fast and slow participants, in wakeful and moderate anaesthesia states in narrative condition. *\u00a0=\u00a0  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05 FDR corrected for multiple comparisons \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nAlthough anaesthesia has been used for over 150\u2009years to reversibly abolish consciousness in clinical medicine, the brain bases of its considerable inter\u2010individual effect variability remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we asked whether the connectivity within and between three networks that are primary sites of propofol\u2010induced sedation and key to conscious cognition\u2014the DAN, ECN, and DMN\u2014underlie individual responsiveness differences under anaesthesia. Consistent with previous studies (Bola et al.,\u00a0 ; Chennu et al.,\u00a0 ), we observed substantial individual differences in RTs and hit rates under moderate anaesthesia. These were not related to differences in perceptual or high\u2010level attention processes. Rather, the inherent level of FC during the narrative condition prior to sedation, within the DAN and ECN, between them, and to the DMN differentiated the participants' responsiveness level. Furthermore, grey matter volume in the frontal cortex aspect of the ECN was significantly related to behavioural responsiveness during sedation. Participants whose RTs showed little change from the wakeful baseline had significantly higher grey matter volume in these regions than participants who showed big changes. Therefore, for the first time, we show that responsiveness variability during propofol anaesthesia relates to differences in inherent brain structural and functional features of the frontoparietal networks, which can be predicted prior to sedation. Additionally, we found that during moderate anaesthesia, the connectivity within and between the DAN, ECN and DMN differentiated fast and slow participants, suggesting that perturbations by anaesthesia further exacerbate inherent inter\u2010individual FC differences. \n\nThe differential impact of moderate anaesthesia on cognitive process can be inferred in a post hoc manner, based on the perceptual and cognitive processes recruited by the target detection task and the brain networks and regions that showed functional and/or structural differences between the participants. The task involved a hierarchy of perceptual and cognitive processes. These included (a) auditory perception, (b) understanding of linguistic instruction, (c) short\u2010term memory to remember instructions for the duration of the experiment, (d) attention to auditory stimuli, (e) attention to intention to make a response, (f) cognitive control over other, competing and distracting mental processes, and the (g) execution of a motor response, when prompted by the auditory stimuli. The clinical assessment determined similar basic language communication (b), and short\u2010term memory function (c) across participants during moderate anaesthesia. Furthermore, our results showed no relationship between behavioural responsiveness and sensory/auditory (a), or higher\u2010order, including linguistic processes that relied on sustained attention (b, d), across participants. Therefore, differences in responsiveness were likely underpinned by differences in complex mental faculties, such as attention to intention (e), cognitive control (f), and action execution (g). \n\nConsistent with this inference, our results demonstrated that FC within and between the DAN and ECN differentiated the participants' level of responsiveness, suggesting that moderate anaesthesia impacts attention to intention and goal and action execution, subserved by the DAN and ECN (Dosenbach et al.,\u00a0 ; Ernst & Paulus,\u00a0 ; Marek & Dosenbach,\u00a0 ). Furthermore, our structural imaging results demonstrated that grey matter volume differences in the frontal cortex aspect of the ECN, including the DLPFC and pre\u2010SMA, underscore individual responsiveness differences. In addition to their role in action selection and execution (Boly et al.,\u00a0 ; Lee et al.,\u00a0 ), the DLPFC and pre\u2010SMA represent higher\u2010order attention, i.e., attention to intention. Lau et al. ( ) investigated the brain regions that were preferentially involved in attending to the intention to move, relative to the actual movement, and found that brain activity in pre\u2010SMA, as well as its FC with right DPFC represented the intention to move. The pre\u2010SMA has also been implicated in sustained cognitive control (Nachev et al.,\u00a0 ), another process that is key to successful task performance. Therefore, a post hoc interpretation of our findings is that moderate anaesthesia impacts attention to intention, sustained cognitive control, and action execution, and that individuals with smaller grey matter volume in frontal regions and weaker FC within and between the DAN and ECN, may have a vulnerability for stronger suppression of behavioural responsiveness than those with higher values for these features. Additionally, the finding DMN connectivity during moderate anaesthesia differentiated fast and slow participants suggests that individual differences in responsiveness may also reflect the effect of sedation on self\u2010referential processes (Andrews\u2010Hanna et al.,\u00a0 ; Beer,\u00a0 ; Buckner et al.,\u00a0 ; D'Argembeau et al.,\u00a0 ; Gusnard et al.,\u00a0 ; Schneider et al.,\u00a0 ; Wicker et al.,\u00a0 ), and context processing (Smith et al.,\u00a0 ; Vatansever et al.,\u00a0 ), which are supported by the DMN. \n\nAs the suppression of behavioural responsiveness is a key aim of anaesthesia, the converse finding was also highly relevant. Surprisingly, we found that 30% of participants showed no delay in RTs under moderate anaesthesia relative to wakefulness, and critically, these exhibited inherent brain differences to participants who were significantly delayed. This result is highly relevant to the prediction of responsiveness variability under anaesthesia (Chennu et al.,\u00a0 ; Palanca et al.,\u00a0 ) and monitoring depth\u2010of\u2010anaesthesia for the detection of unintended intraoperative awareness. Although rare (0.1\u20130.2%, Mashour & Avidan,\u00a0 ; Sandin et al.,\u00a0 ), unintended awareness can be very traumatic and lead to negative long\u2010term health outcomes, such as post\u2010traumatic stress disorder (up to 70%), as well as clinical depression or phobias (Mashour & Avidan,\u00a0 ; Pandit et al.,\u00a0 ; Pandit & Cook,\u00a0 ). Given its rarity, unintended intraoperative awareness does not lend itself to direct investigation in the relatively small groups of typical research studies with vulnerable populations, including the present study, where individuals were anaesthetized without intubation in a research MRI setting. \n\nOur results suggest that individuals with larger grey matter volume in frontal regions and stronger FC within DAN and ECN, between them and to the DMN, may require higher doses of propofol to become nonresponsive to the same extent as individuals with weaker connectivity in these networks and smaller grey matter volume in frontal cortex. If replicated in a clinical context, these findings will provide novel markers that may help to improve the accuracy of awareness monitoring during clinical anaesthesia. We note that future clinical studies ought to measure the clearance of anaesthetic agents by each individual directly for, potentially, a more precise assessment of the metabolic variation across participants, than that provided by the anaesthesia delivery instrument used here. It is also worth noting that propofol was used here due to its wide prominence in clinical interventions, and future studies that employ the same paradigm across different agents will determine whether the brain\u2010behaviour relationships we report here generalize to other anaesthetic agents. \n\nThe detection of individual responsiveness to anaesthesia prior to the sedation procedure is a question of clinical importance. We found that the wakeful narrative condition yielded the highest power relative to the other conditions for the detection of individual sedation responsiveness. This may be due to higher signal to noise during the narrative condition. Previous studies have shown that the active attention engagement during well\u2010crafted narratives leads to reduced movement (Centeno et al.,\u00a0 ) and less sleep in scanner (Centeno et al.,\u00a0 ; Vanderwal et al.,\u00a0 ), resulting in higher signal\u2010to\u2010noise relative to rs fMRI (Wang et al.,\u00a0 ). Moreover, it may be due to higher power to detect functional roles of brain networks during naturalistic stimuli relative to rsfMRI. Rs fMRI is entirely unconstrained, and thus it is difficult to separate signal due to cognitive processes from extraneous sources, including motion, cardiac and respiratory physiological noise, arterial CO2 concentration, blood pressure, and vasomotion (Birn et al.,\u00a0 ; Murphy et al.,\u00a0 ). By contrast, as we have previously established, naturalistic narratives drive diverging responses across brain networks, highlighting their functionally distinct roles, and thus may be more sensitive for investigating how their differing cognitive roles are impacted by anaesthesia than rsfMRI (Haugg et al.,\u00a0 ; Naci et al.,\u00a0 ; Naci et al.,\u00a0 ). Our results are consistent with a growing recognition of the importance of naturalistic stimuli for studying cognitive processes and understanding the neural basis of real\u2010world functioning (Sonkusare et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n### Methodological considerations \n  \nIt is worth noting that this investigation included a relatively small sample size, not atypical of research studies with vulnerable populations, for aforementioned participant safety considerations. Future studies that will replicate findings in larger clinical groups are needed to further corroborate the present findings. Furthermore, as MRI technology improves, newer scanning parameters including shorter TR and higher spatial resolution could better capture spatiotemporal differences that underlie individual differences in response to anaesthesia. \n\n\n\n## FUNDING INFORMATION \n  \nThis work was supported by the Provost PhD Award Scheme from Trinity College Dublin, an L'Oreal for Women In Science International Rising Talent Award, and the Welcome Trust Institutional Strategic Support grant to L.N, and by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR), the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and a Canada Excellence Research Chairs Award (Grant No. 215063) to A.M.O. and by an ERC Advanced Grant (FOUNDCOG) (Grant No. 787981) to R.C. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors declare no conflict of interest. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10028637, "text_md5": "62c7dcf259610d37d69f31135a19a12a", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 85], "journal": [86, 100], "publication_year": [102, 106], "title": [117, 257], "keywords": [271, 346], "abstract": [359, 2289], "body": [2298, 53108]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 36617994, "doi": "10.1002/hbm.26199", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10028637", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10028637"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10028637\">10028637</a>", "list_title": "PMC10028637  Responsiveness variability during anaesthesia relates to inherent differences in brain structure and function of the frontoparietal networks"}

To study the underlying neural processes, three comedy clips were shown twice to 20 volunteers during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Inter-subject similarities in humor ratings, obtained immediately after fMRI, explained inter-subject correlation of hemodynamic activity in right frontal pole and in a number of other brain regions. General linear model analysis also indicated activity in right frontal pole, as well as in additional cortical areas and subcortically in striatum, explained by humorousness. The association of the right frontal pole with experienced humorousness is a novel finding, which might be related to humor unfolding over longer time scales in the movie clips. Specifically, frontal pole has been shown to exhibit longer temporal receptive windows than, e.g., sensory areas, which might have enabled processing of humor in the clips based on holding information and reinterpreting that in light of new information several (even tens of) seconds later. As another novel finding, medial and lateral prefrontal areas, frontal pole, posterior-inferior temporal areas, posterior parietal areas, posterior cingulate, striatal structures and amygdala showed reduced activity upon re-viewing of the clips, suggesting involvement in processing of humor related to novelty of the comedic events. \n \n\n# Body\n \nHumor is a multifaceted and highly interesting phenomenon that is an essential aspect of the social nature of human species. Understanding and sharing humor as well as laughing together plays an important role in social bonding and group formation , possibly   via   an endogenous opioidergic mechanism . Interpreting stressful situations as humorous further provides an important psychological coping mechanism for individuals and social groups, and allows presentation of conflicting information in a softer forms . Humor has also been thought to act as a fitness indicator in sexual selection. Conversely, difficulties in understanding humor cause problems such as reducing one\u2019s likeability by others and constraining one\u2019s social life. Therefore, research into the neural basis of interpretation and experience of humor is clearly warranted. \n\nPrevious functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, by contrasting blood-oxygen level dependent signal elicited by relatively simple humorous   vs  . non-humorous stimuli such as cartoons , drawings coupled with text providing humorous vs. non-humorous surprising interpretations , short verbal passages , and movie clips , have disclosed a number of brain regions that participate in processing of humor. These have included inferior frontal gyrus , middle frontal gyrus , superior frontal gyrus , middle temporal gyrus , temporal pole , left ventromedial prefrontal cortex , supplementary motor area , inferior parietal lobule , temporal-occipital junction , and subcortical structures, such as nucleus accumbens and amygdala , as well as parahippocampal gyrus . \n\nBased on such findings, detailed models have been suggested about the specific roles of different brain regions in the process of understanding jokes, such as detection and resolution of incongruity . For example, results of a recent meta-analysis suggested that detection and resolution of incongruity takes place in areas residing in the junction of temporal, parietal and occipital lobes, and responses related to rewarding effects of humor can be localized to midbrain dopaminergic structures . One important aspect of the neural basis of humor that has been studied relatively little is which brain processes are relevant for processing of novelty of humorous events,   i.e.  , which neurocognitive processes underlie the phenomenon that jokes, whilst often still funny, are not as funny the second time one hears them. \n\nRecent studies have shown that movies can successfully be used as naturalistic stimuli during fMRI , thus providing an approach that is very well suited for studies on brain processing of real-life like humor in comedy movies. There are several complementary analysis approaches to achieve this. By aligning the brains of individual subjects and calculating correlations between the hemodynamic activity time courses for each voxel, one can inspect the degree of similarity in how the brains of individual subjects respond to common naturalistic stimuli such as movies. In previous studies that have utilized this inter-subject correlation (ISC) approach, significant ISC has been observed in both sensory cortical areas  and hierarchically higher-order cortical areas such as the prefrontal cortex  when subjects are watching movies during fMRI. The obvious strength of the ISC method is that one does not need to have any   a priori   models of the fMRI signal in response to complex movie stimulus in order to carry out the analysis, since the results are solely based on similarities in how the subjects\u2019 brains react to the various aspects of the movie stimulus . On the other hand, it was recently shown that ISC analysis detects relevant brain regions in highly structured experimental setups almost as sensitively as a model-based analysis . \n\nWhile an ISC analysis of fMRI data obtained during watching of a movie provides a map of brain areas that respond similarly across subjects, additional analyses are needed in order to determine which aspects of the movie stimulus and/or what experiences, such as shared emotional states elicited by the movies, explain the observed pattern of inter-subject similarity in hemodynamic signal. More specifically, self-reports of subjective experiences can be correlated with the ISC. As an example of this approach, fluctuations in self-reported emotional valence and arousal were successfully correlated with cortical ISC inspected over 20-sec sliding time window in a previous study . A number of brain regions, including prefrontal ones, were disclosed wherein ISC co-varied with negative valence and elevated arousal . Another data analysis approach that has been successfully used in movie studies and allows for pinpointing effects related to specific stimulus features in the movie and/or subjective states is general linear model (GLM) where specific stimulus feature time courses such as presence of human faces in the movie  or emotions experienced by the subjects while watching movies  have been used as predictors of hemodynamic activity. \n\nTo our knowledge, there have been only three previous studies where comedy-genre movie clips have been shown to healthy adult volunteers to map brain areas involved in processing of humor under naturalistic conditions. In the first study, episodes of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and \u201cthe Simpsons\u201d were shown to subjects during fMRI . The laugh-track of the Seinfeld and a separately obtained laugh-track of the Simpsons episode were used as predictors in the analysis of the fMRI data. Analysis of time periods two seconds prior to onset of, and during, laughter on the laugh-track disclosed brain areas involved in detection and resolution of incongruity, including bilaterally posterior middle temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, insula, and amygdala. Hemodynamic activity during the laugh-track events was further seen unilaterally in the right cerebellum and in the left-hemisphere anterior temporal cortex, thalamus, lateral parietal cortex, and hippocampus . In this early study, however, subjective ratings of experienced humorousness were not obtained from the subjects, but rather the overt reactions of separate studio (Seinfeld) and experimental (the Simpsons) audiences were used in the fMRI analysis. In another pioneering study, amusing film clips were shown to the subjects  both during in-scanner rating of humorousness and passive watching of the clips with a subsequent separate experienced humorousness rating session. In the passive viewing condition, activations of right posterior insula, middle and superior temporal gyri bilaterally as well as cuneous were observed as a function of experienced humorousness. When the subjects rated their degree of experienced humorousness while they watched the movie clips during fMRI, these areas were also observed to be activated, and additionally there were significant prefrontal, anterior cingulate gyrus, thalamic, cerebellar, and striatal activations . \n\nIn the third study, short 24-sec movie clips of stand-up-comedy were shown to volunteers during fMRI . Individual ratings of humorousness were obtained from the subjects after each clip, and activations in certain brain areas additional to those observed in  were documented . These findings are in line with other studies wherein humoristic material other than movie clips was used as stimuli (  e.g.  , cartoons) and subjective ratings of humorousness were used as predictors in the fMRI data analysis. Looking across these studies, the additional areas active during experienced humorousness included dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , fusiform gyrus , cingulate gyrus , supplementary motor area , medial-ventral prefrontal cortex , and subcortically putamen , as well as nucleus accumbens . \n\nIn the present fMRI study, we set forth to investigate which brain areas respond similarly when watching relatively long (~5\u2009min) movie clips of comedy genre. The movie clips were taken from comedy-genre movies \u201cThe Circus\u201d and \u201cCity Lights\u201d, directed by Charles Chaplin and produced by Charles Chaplin Productions in 1928 and 1931, respectively. We hypothesized that, in addition to sensory cortical areas, we would observe significant ISC in brain regions implicated as humor-related areas in previous fMRI studies. In addition to this, we hypothesized that between-subject similarities in self-rated experienced humorousness explain similarities in hemodynamic activity in brain areas involved in generation of experienced humorousness when viewing the comedy-genre movie clips. Furthermore, we hypothesized that GLM analysis with experienced humor ratings as predictors discloses similar brain regions as the ISC analysis approach and that there are several brain regions that will show diminished humor-related hemodynamic responses when the subjects watch the comedy clips for the first time   vs  . when the clips are re-shown. Here we assume that novelty related to building up of expectations and subsequent violation of those expectations, which constitutes one of the core methods of joke-telling , is reduced during re-viewing. To validate this assumption, we carried out a separate behavioral control experiment where subjects viewed the movie clips twice and rated their self-experienced humorousness on both views. \n\n## Results \n  \nConsistent patterns of significant ISC were observed in both sensory and higher-order cortical areas over viewing of the three different movie clips. This is seen in   that displays maps of statistically significant ISC overlaid on top of axial slices of across-subjects averaged anatomical images. The ISC maps shown in this figure were calculated from hemodynamic activity recorded during the first viewing of the three movie clips. Voxel-wise spatial Pearson correlation coefficients between ISC maps over the whole brain were r\u2009=\u20090.82 (between first clip and second clip), r\u2009=\u20090.83 (between first clip and third clip), and r\u2009=\u20090.81 (between second clip and third clip), indicating high consistency in areas showing ISC across the clips (an overlap map and all other fMRI results can be browsed online at:  ). \n\nThe self-reports of experienced humorousness (that were obtained once every 15\u2009seconds during re-watching of each of the movie clips immediately after the fMRI session, as well as the ones obtained during first and repeated viewing of the same clips in the separate behavioral control experiment) are shown in  . Overall, it can be seen that some parts of the clips were experienced as funnier than others. There was also some inter-subject variability in the degree of experienced humorousness as disclosed by the standard errors of the mean (SEM). Correlations between humorousness ratings for each pair of subjects are also shown in  . These show that there were inter-individual differences in the experienced humorousness between some pairs of subjects but also high degree of similarity between some subjects. Kendall\u2019s W, a statistical summary measure of inter-rater agreement, was for the three movie clips 0.52, 0.47, and 0.47 (p\u2009<\u20090.001 for each), implying significant overall agreement between the subjects in their ratings. Further, the fMRI and control group seemed to rate the humorousness highly similarly. Pearson correlations between the post-fMRI across-subjects averaged self-rating time course and that obtained during the first viewing of the same clip in the control experiment were r\u2009=\u20090.96 for the first clip, r\u2009=\u20090.92 for the second clip, and 0.91 for the third clip (p\u2009<\u20090.001 for each). In case of the first clip, there was significantly higher (p\u2009<\u20090.05) correlation between ratings given to first viewing in the fMRI group and the first viewing in the control group, than between ratings given to first viewing in the fMRI group and the second viewing in the control group. For the other two clips, the direction of the effect was the same, but the effects failed to reach significance. Further, while the same humorous events were identified during the second viewing of the clips in the behavioral control experiment, the self-reported intensity of experienced humorousness was significantly weaker during the second viewing of the clips as compared with the first viewing (p\u2009<\u20090.001, p\u2009<\u20090.05, and p\u2009<\u20090.01 when tested across all time points for the first, second, and third clip, respectively). \n\nThe self-ratings of experienced humorousness were utilized in two distinct ways in the fMRI data analysis to disclose brain regions wherein hemodynamic signal is explained by experienced humorousness. First, a Mantel test was carried out where between-subject similarities in self-rated humorous experience were used to explain similarities in hemodynamic activity  (see   for an illustration of the steps in this test). Six brain regions most significantly observed in this analysis are shown in   and the MNI coordinates of the significant peak voxels are listed in  . There were several brain regions in which between-subjects similarity in self-rated humorousness explained ISC: the right hemisphere frontal pole, lateral occipital cortex, and middle temporal gyrus, in the left hemisphere supramarginal gyrus, lateral cerebellum, middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, angular gyrus, post-central gyrus, planum temporale, temporo-occipital fusiform cortex, lateral occipital cortex, lingual gyrus, and parietal operculum. \n\nIn addition, we used GLM to determine in which brain areas the self-ratings of humorousness explained brain hemodynamic activity during first viewing of the movie clips.   shows that there were a number of areas activated during segments of self-experienced humorousness. There were significant bilateral activations in striatal structures that have been associated with processing of reward, in several prefrontal, temporal, and parietal areas, as well as cingulate cortex, and amygdala. MNI coordinates of the cluster peak voxels of significant activations in this analysis are listed in  . \n\n shows the areas which exhibited in GLM analysis higher hemodynamic activity during the first viewing of the humorous movie clips than during the second viewing of the clips,   e.g.  , when the building-up of expectancies, and subsequent violation of the expectancies (in a funny way), had lost their novelty. As can be seen, there were significant bilateral activations in striatal structures, in several medial and lateral prefrontal cortical areas, inferior temporal, cerebellar, posterior cingulate, and parietal areas. MNI coordinates of the cluster peak voxels of significant activations in this analysis are listed in  . We failed to see any significant activations in the opposite contrast (  i.e.  , testing for stronger humor-related activity during the second than during first viewing). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nPrevious fMRI studies have suggested several subcortical, parietal, temporal, and prefrontal brain regions as important for interpretation of jokes and the associated experienced humorousness  (for a recent review, see ). In the present study, we examined which brain areas show across-subject replicable hemodynamic activity when healthy subjects are watching three ~5-minute movie clips taken from comedy films the \u201cThe Circus\u201d and \u201cCity Lights\u201d, both directed by Charles Chaplin and produced by Charles Chaplin Productions in 1928 and 1931, containing a variety of non-verbal humor. Further, to pinpoint areas related to processing of humor, we tested 1) in which brain areas the degree of subjectively experienced humor predicts the degree of ISC of hemodynamic activity, 2) in which brain areas the self-ratings of humorousness predict hemodynamic activity in a model based analysis, and 3) in which brain areas humor-related hemodynamic activity is decreased when going from the first-time viewing to the repeated viewing of the movie clips,   e.g.  , when the detection of incongruity and resolution of it had lost their novelty . Here, it has to be noted as a cautionary remark that not all humor in the video clips involved detecting of incongruity and finding resolution of it, but also contained, e.g., jokes based on the building up and violation of expectations of the movie character that are fully expected by movie viewers. \n\nIn line with the findings of a number of previous studies , we observed significant ISC in multiple sensory areas of the brain when the subjects watched the movies, indicating that the subjects were visually sampling each of the three movie clips in a highly similar manner (see  ). We also observed significant ISC in a number of brain regions that have been suggested to participate in processing of humorous stimuli in previous studies with simplified stimuli  and movie stimuli in adults  and children . As can be seen in  , significant ISC was consistently observed across the three different comedy movie clips that were shown in the present study. Naturally, the fact that we observed significant ISC in a replicable manner across the three comedy clips in a given brain region does not necessarily mean that the brain region is involved in processing of humor, since each of the comedy clips contain a wealth of stimulus features and information unrelated to the humorous content. Further, as we have shown previously, ISC calculated across the whole time series might miss brain areas showing similarity specifically during emotional states . Given this, lack of ISC in a brain area does not necessarily implicate that the brain area is not involved in humor processing as there were a number of time windows in the clips with relatively low experienced humor (see  ). \n\nIn the present study, we attempted to pinpoint brain regions specifically involved in elicitation of subjectively experienced humor. As a cautionary remark, one has to keep in mind that since emotional processing is partly unconscious, self-reported values may represent limited aspect of experiencing humorousness. We first carried out a Mantel test , where between-subject similarities in self-rated experienced humorousness were used to explain between-subject similarities in hemodynamic activity in the brain regions that showed significant ISC. This test revealed that hemodynamic activity in multiple left and right-hemisphere areas was associated with experienced humorousness (see  ; for a comprehensive list of areas disclosed by this analysis see  ). Of the observed areas, the association of the right frontal pole with experienced humorousness is a novel finding. Naturally, the sensitivity of the Mantel test between ISC and experienced humorousness is subject to similar shortcoming as the ISC calculated over the duration of the clips: there might be ISC in specific time windows of higher level of experienced humorousness that the analysis might miss. \n\nTo complement this analysis, we tested with GLM which brain regions are associated with experienced humorousness. The brain regions showing significant activations in this analysis are shown in   and listed on  . As can be seen, the involvement of the frontal pole in humor processing was confirmed by the GLM analysis. Furthermore, an array of additional areas were observed to be associated with experienced humorousness, including extensive cerebellar, temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortical areas, as well as striatal structures and amygdalas subcortically, thus supporting previous observations . Observing these additional areas suggests that the GLM analysis was more sensitive than the Mantel test. Of these, the activation of striatal structures have been linked to rewarding effects of experienced humor in previous studies and areas in the junction of temporal and parietal lobes have been linked with the resolution of incongruence in humor . However, it should be noted that the Mantel test and GLM analysis test different (although related) hypotheses and straightforward comparison of the results of these analyses is not necessarily possible. \n\nThe finding of significant ISC and hemodynamic activity associated with experienced humorousness in frontal pole is a new one and might, tentatively, be related to processing of humor unfolding over longer time scales in the relatively long comedy clip stimuli. This is theoretical speculation that should be viewed with caution, however, it is based on recent findings showing that especially anterior prefrontal regions integrate incoming higher-order information over longer temporal receptive windows than for example primary and secondary sensory areas . In the case of experienced humor, it is often the case that understanding a joke is based on keeping in mind preceding information and reinterpreting that information in the light of new incoming information several seconds or even a few tens of seconds later. Temporal receptive windows longer than those in sensory areas are needed to successfully carry out such operations . \n\nUsing GLM we further tested in which brain regions hemodynamic activity associated with experienced humorousness was diminished going from the first to the repeated viewing of the comedy clips. Here, we assumed that such effects take place due to decreasing novelty, as novelty is important for humorousness (and indeed the results of our behavioral control experiment shown in   confirmed that experienced humorousness was diminished for the second viewing of the clips). The results of this analysis are shown in   and  . As can be seen, there were significant bilateral activations in striatal structures, in several medial and lateral prefrontal cortical areas including frontal pole, right anterior insula, amygdala bilaterally, inferior temporal, cerebellar, posterior cingulate, and a number of parietal areas. It is possible that these areas are especially important for solving the humor-related incongruence and the rewarding effects of comedic events when they are seen for the first time. Notably, the fact that frontal pole was observed also in this analysis add further support for the notion that frontal pole is associated with experienced humorousness. \n\nAcross the three previous studies wherein comedy-genre movie clips have been used as naturalistic stimuli in healthy adult volunteers , humor-related activity was observed in or in the vicinity of most of the brain regions that were observed in the present study. Some of the areas observed in the present study were not, however, seen in these three previous studies. Specifically, the hemodynamic activity associated with self-ratings of experienced humor in frontal poles (see  ,  ,  ) does not seem to match any of the activation foci documented in the previous studies that used comedy-genre movie clips . While it is difficult to say with certainty what might have caused these discrepancies in findings, it is possible that they stem from differences in experimental design. In one of the previous studies the laugh track obtained from separate groups of individuals was used as the humorousness predictor in a model-based analysis , whereas in our study, self-reported subjective experiences of humorousness of the scanned subjects were utilized in the ISC and GLM based analysis approaches. As suggested by relatively large inter-subject variability in experienced humorousness of the movie clips in our study involving some of the subject pairs (see  ), humor might be one of the more subjective experiences and thus using an independently derived model of humorousness in fMRI data analysis might result in a failure to see some effects. \n\nFurthermore, in the other one of the previous studies where movie clips were used as stimuli , the duration of the clips was 24\u2009seconds which is considerably shorter than the approximately five-minute clip duration that were used in the present study. Thus, the shorter 24-sec clips might have lacked development of humorous events over longer timescales that have been observed to be processed in anterior prefrontal areas, including the frontal poles . As a further experimental design difference that might explain differences in findings, the subjects rated the humorousness of each of the 24-sec clips immediately after having seen them during the fMRI scanning in the previous study , whereas in the present study the clips were rated only after the fMRI session without any advance warning, thus allowing for more natural free viewing conditions. In a previous study where passive viewing and viewing during rating of humorousness were directly contrasted, both augmentation of activity and activation of additional areas was observed during in-scanner rating . \n\nWhile it is tempting to speculate which of the observed brain areas participated in which aspect of humor processing, such as resolution of incongruence, our experimental setup was limited in the sense that it does not make it possible to answer such questions directly. According to a recent meta-analysis, temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) is an important area that deals with resolution of incongruence that often is an important constituent of humorous events . The fact that we observed activity related to humor novelty in or in the vicinity of TPJ (see  ) tentatively suggests that the effects we observed therein were due to resolution of humor-related incongruence in the course of watching the movie clips. The left-hemisphere inferior temporal regions might have, in turn, been due to higher-order visual-semantic processing, though these areas have been less saliently associated with specific aspects of humor processing in previous studies . As a further cautionary remark, one has to keep in mind that we cannot completely rule out that some of the observed humor-novelty effects could have been due to non-specific effects of stimulus novelty. There are previous studies that have presented naturalistic stimuli with inter-stimulus intervals comparable to those in the present study between first and repeated presentation of a movie clip (  i.e.  , several minutes; it is in fact important to realize that typical repetition-suppression effects are unlikely to explain the present findings as such mostly occur with inter-stimulus intervals of ~seconds). In such studies, novelty effects (unrelated to experiencing humor) have been observed in superior-lateral temporal cortices and insula bilaterally as well as in left inferior frontal gyrus . Given the fact that there were considerable inter-individual differences in which scenes were experienced humorously in the present study, the fact that the hemodynamic effects were significantly associated with this variability in the analyses that were employed, and the fact that such associations were diminished upon repeated viewing of the clips as experienced humorousness diminished, suggests genuine involvement of the areas in experiencing humorousness and the diminution of that as the novelty of the humor washed away. This especially applies to our novel observation of the involvement of frontal pole in experienced humorousness during watching of movie clips, given that the frontal pole was consistently observed across all these analyses. \n\nIn conclusion, our study expands research on the neural basis of humor in several ways. First, as a novel finding, we observed that the frontal pole is synchronized across subjects and exhibits increased hemodynamic activity in association with self-experienced humorousness. Naturally, caution needs to be exercised when speculating on the possible underlying mechanisms, but it is possible that these anterior frontal lobe areas are involved in processing humor that occurs over longer timescales in the relatively long movie clips used in the present study, given that previous studies have shown that anterior prefrontal regions process stimulus events over longer timescales than sensory cortical areas. As the second novel finding, we showed that multiple areas in prefrontal, inferior temporal, and parietal cortices as well as subcortically striatal structures that are associated with humor processing were diminished in activity upon re-viewing of the movie clips when novelty of the humorous events had been washed away. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \n20 healthy volunteers (age range: 20\u201325, 7 females, normal or corrected to normal vision) participated in the main experiment that consisted of fMRI scanning session and behavioral self-ratings. Two subjects were excluded from fMRI data analysis due to technical problems with their fMRI data. A separate group of 18 healthy volunteers (age range: 20\u201329, 9 females, normal or corrected to normal vision) participated in a behavioral control experiment (for details of the main and control experiments, see below). A voluntary informed consent was obtained from each of the subjects prior to participation, both experiments were run in accordance with the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration, and ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the National Yang Ming University prior to commencing the research. \n\n\n### Stimuli and MRI acquisition \n  \nIn the main experiment, the subjects were presented with three short silent movie clips twice, in an order that was randomized across subjects, during 3T (Tim Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) fMRI with a 32-channel head coil. (Echo-planar imaging (EPI); TR/TE\u2009=\u20092000/30\u2009ms, field-of-view\u2009=\u2009220\u2009\u00d7\u2009220\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, in-plane 3.4\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4\u2009mm, slice thickness\u2009=\u20093.4\u2009mm, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0). Thirty-three axial slices were acquired to cover the whole brain. The movie clips were taken from comedy-genre movies \u201cThe Circus\u201d and \u201cCity Lights\u201d, directed by Charles Chaplin and produced by Charles Chaplin Productions in 1928 and 1931, respectively. The two clips from \u201cThe Circus\u201d ( ) were taken from 6\u201930\u201d and 58\u201932\u201d of the movie for 4\u201933\u201d and 5\u201908\u201d, respectively. One clip from \u201cCity Light\u201d ( ) was taken from 1:03\u201901\u201d of the movie for 5\u201917\u201d. The clips were displayed in fMRI with a projector (PT-D5500U, Panasoic, Osaka, Japan) onto a semi-translucent screen fitted to the bore of the MRI scanner. Participants watched movie clips via a reflecting mirror mounted on the head coil array. We obtained 145, 166, and 162 fMRI volumes during each movie clip. There were pauses of two minutes between the runs in order to wash out the effects of the preceding clip. Prior to the fMRI, a high-resolution   T  -weighted anatomical (MPRAGE sequence, TR/TI/TE/flip\u2009=\u20092530\u2009ms/1100\u2009ms/3.03\u2009ms/7 , partition thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, 192 partitions, FOV\u2009=\u200922.4\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200922.4\u2009cm) scans were obtained from each subject. \n\n\n### Self-reported humor ratings \n  \nIn the main experiment, the subjects were re-shown, immediately after the fMRI session, and without advance warning, the three silent comedy clips on a PC screen and were asked to recall and rate, on a Likert scale running from 1 to 10, once every 15\u2009seconds, the degree of humorousness that they had experienced due to the humorous events depicted in the movies. During rating, a 15-s clip segment was first shown to the participant. Then the rating program waited for the participant\u2019s rating on a 10-point Likert scale. After completing the rating, the rating program automatically started the showing of the next 15-s clip segment. This procedure was repeated until the last 15-s clip segment was shown and the participant\u2019s rating was collected. We used E-Prime 2.0 (version 2.0.8.90, Psychology Software Tools Inc., Sharpsburg, PA, USA) to control the presentation of movie clips and the acquisition of behavioral responses for both fMRI and control experiments. Note that the participants were specifically instructed to recall the humorousness they had experienced during the first viewing of the movie clips that took place during fMRI scanning. This method is analogous to what we have used in our previous fMRI studies on cerebral basis of experienced emotions (J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen   et al  . ; Nummenmaa   et al  . ). A rating of one corresponded to lack of experienced humor and a rating of ten corresponded to high degree of experienced humor. In the control experiment, the separate set of 18 subjects viewed the three movie clips twice. They were instructed to rate the degree of humorousness they experienced while viewing the three clips for the first time, with the self-rating taking place after each 15-sec segment, followed by viewing and rating of the three clips for the second time. The order in which the clips were shown was identical to that in the fMRI experiment. The control experiment was specifically designed to test to what extent the degree of experienced humorousness is altered from the first to second viewing of the humorous clips. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nEPI data were first pre-processed with FSL ( , version 4.0) by applying motion correction, slice-timing correction, and spatial smoothing (3D isotropic Gaussian kernel with the full-width-half-maximum\u2009=\u20096\u2009mm). Subsequently, individual-subject EPI data were spatially registered to individual anatomical data using the 12-parameter affine transformation as implemented in FSL. Finally, across-subject morphing was accomplished by registering anatomical images to MNI space at 2\u2009mm isotropic resolution. \n\nISC was calculated separately for fMRI data obtained during each movie clip for the first and second viewing using our previously published toolbox (ISC-Toolbox, version 2.1) . Before calculation of ISC, we first removed the time-invariant constant value and the linear trend in each EPI time series using General Linear Model. The ISC for each movie was computed as the voxel-wise mean correlation of the BOLD time series across all pairs of subjects as detailed in . The statistical inference was accomplished by a fully nonparametric voxel-wise resampling test  and a formal description of the test can be found in . The resampling test constructs the null-distribution of the ISC values by circularly shifting the time series of each subject by a random amount and thus breaking the simultaneous timing between the time series of different subjects while retaining other characteristics of the time series. The full resampling distribution was approximated with 100 000\u2009000 realizations, sampling randomly across the brain voxels for each realization. The resulting ISC maps were thresholded at Bonferroni-corrected level of p\u2009=\u20090.01 and overlaid on the MNI space. After this, we tested in which brain areas inter-subject similarity in self-ratings of experienced humorousness was associated with inter-subject similarity of brain activity. To achieve this, we calculated inter-subject correlation of the self-reported experienced humorousness for each subject pair and used a Mantel test to determine the extent that these pair-wise correlations explained the pair-wise ISC. A Mantel test makes inferences about association between two distance (or similarity) matrices . Here, we modified the Mantel test to combine data across the three different movie-viewing sessions and for allowing multiple comparisons correction with a reasonable computational cost. The basic logic of this analysis approach is illustrated in  . \n\nSpecifically, the modified Mantel test was carried out as follows: for each voxel   v  ,   I  (  v  ),   j  \u2009=\u20091,2,3, is the Fisher\u2019s z-transformed N x N intersubject correlation matrix of hemodynamic responses for the movie   j   and the first viewing session. Let   C   be the Fisher\u2019s z-transformed N x N correlation matrix of experienced humorousness ratings for the movie   j   across N subjects. N\u2009=\u200918 denotes the number of subjects. We de-meaned the matrices   I  (  v  ) so that their average over the brain voxels was a zero matrix. The de-meaned matrices are   F  (  v  )\u2009=\u2009  and K is the number of brain voxels. The purpose of the de-meaning was to prevent the unwanted influence of the average BOLD-ISC between two subjects to the Mantel statistics that biases the Mantel test statistic if the average BOLD-ISC correlations were (by chance) correlated with humorousness rating correlations. Let ut(  A  ) denote the operation of extracting the upper triangular part of a matrix   A   and vectorizing it. Applied to an 18\u2009\u00d7\u200918 correlation matrix   C  , this operation produces a 153-element vector of all the distinct correlation values in the matrix   C  . For a voxel   v  , the test statistic of the modified Mantel test   M  (  v  ) measures the association between the vectors   f  (  v  )\u2009=\u2009  and    a   \u2009=\u2009  and we use the notation   M  (  v  )\u2009=\u2009Assoc(  f  (  v  ),  a  ). To measure the association, we applied Pearson correlation to test the relation between the humor ratings and the ISC during the first viewing, \n\n\n\nwhere   (resp.  ) denotes the average of the elements of the vector   a   (   f   (   v   )) \n\nTo form a distribution for the test statistic under the null-hypothesis that the mechanism that generates pair-wise humorousness-rating correlations is independent from the mechanism that generates pair-wise ISCs of hemodynamic activity, rows and columns of each of the three self-report correlation matrices were first randomly permuted as in the Mantel test . Thereafter, the three permuted matrices were randomly re-ordered and the test-statistic distribution under the null-hypothesis was formed by repeating the process twenty million times by randomly sampling a different voxel each time. Only those voxels that exhibited small ISC values for all movies (  i.e.  , voxels whose ISC values were smaller than the FDR corrected ISC threshold with q\u2009=\u20090.05 for all movies) were sampled when calculating the null-distribution. Note that the FDR corrected threshold with q\u2009=\u20090.05 is a very liberal ISC threshold and particularly it is more liberal than Bonferroni corrected threshold with   p  \u2009=\u20090.01 used in  . In more detail: Let the operation perm (  N  ) return a random permutation of the integers 1, \u2026,   N  . To approximate the null-distribution P  for M, the following extension of the standard Mantel-matrix re-sampling scheme is utilized: \n\nRepeat following steps 20 million times:   \nSample a voxel u that does not show significant ISC for any movie \n  \nPermute the rows and columns of   C   with the same permutation resulting in   C  ,   i.e.  , compute:for   j   from 1 to 3  p  \u2009\u2190\u2009perm(N)  C  \u2009\u2190\u2009  C  [  p  ,  p  ] // Rows and columns of   C   permuted with the same permutationend \n  \nPermute   C  ,   C  ,   C   resulting in   C  ,   C  ,   C  , i.e., compute  p  \u2009\u2190\u2009perm (3)  C  \u2009\u2190\u2009  C   C  \u2009\u2190\u2009  C   C  \u2009\u2190\u2009  C  \n  \nCompute Assoc ([ut (  F  (u)) ut   F  (u)) ut (  F  (u))], [ut (  C  ) ut (  C  ) ut (  C  )]) and add it to P \n  \n\nThe reason for restricting the set of voxels sampled to form the null distribution is that the variance of Mantel statistic increases with the increase of the average ISC. Thus, the idea is to reduce the effect of the high ISC voxels (located mainly in visual cortex) to the null distribution (sampling also these voxels widens the null distribution) and avoid a test that would be conservatively biased version of the already conservative Mantel test . Naturally, this choice is reflected in the interpretation of null-hypothesis and obviously prevents using extreme statistics-based permutation procedures for multiple comparison correction. A better alternative would have been to compute a separate null-distribution for each voxel, but the high computational cost prohibits this. \n\nTo correct the resulting   p  -values for multiple comparisons, we applied the voxel-wise FDR correction over the whole brain at the threshold q\u2009=\u20090.05. We present the results as a Z-statistic map obtained by transforming an uncorrected p-value map into the corresponding Z-statistic map using the p-to-Z transform. Obviously, the p-value threshold (p\u2009=\u20090.00004 corresponding to the FDR threshold q\u2009=\u20090.05) applied to the map was transformed in the same way. \n\nIn addition to the model-free ISC analysis, we tested using GLM based analysis in which brain areas hemodynamic activity was associated with experienced humorousness during the first viewing of the three movie clips. Three level mixed effects statistical analyses were performed within FSL\u2019s FEAT tool (version: 6.00) . At the first (single subject and movie) level, we entered experienced humorousness ratings of each individual subject (along with their first temporal derivatives) as predictors in a GLM after convolution with the standard hemodynamic response waveform (a double gamma-function). Higher level group analyses, first across the subjects and then across the three movies, were performed using FSL\u2019s FLAME (with the 1\u2009+\u20092 option and the outlier de-weighting) using a mixed effects model for both the second and the third level analyses . To correct for multiple comparisons, FDR correction was applied at q\u2009=\u20090.05 (voxel-wise across the whole brain). After this, we tested using GLM in which brain areas hemodynamic activity associated with experienced humorousness was reduced (or increased) going from the first-time viewing to the repeated viewing of the movie clips. We specifically assumed that brain hemodynamic activity associated with humorousness decreases when the building-up of expectancies, and subsequent violation of the expectancies (that are one important constituent of humor), lose their novelty. We entered experienced humorousness ratings of each individual subject as predictors (along with their first temporal derivatives) in a GLM after convolution with the standard hemodynamic response waveform, and contrasted first viewing against the second viewing of the clips.

Thus, focusing intervention efforts at pre-empting addiction in vulnerable populations, thereby preventing MA-use-induced neurological changes that make recovery so challenging, may prove more effective than targeting chronic users. One approach is studying casual/recreational users, not diagnosed with substance use disorder. This group may be at high risk for addiction due to their experience with MA. On the other hand, they may be resilient against addiction since they were able to maintain casual use over the years and not become addicted. Understanding their neuro-cognitive characteristics during decision-making and risk-taking would help solve this dilemma and, may help identify intervention strategies. Unfortunately, research on neuro-cognitive characteristics of casual MA users is currently lacking. In this work we begin to address this deficit. \n\nThis study was part of a larger investigation of neural correlates of risky sexual decision-making in men who have sex with men. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, 31 casual MA users and 66 non-users performed the CUPS task, in which they decided to accept or refuse a series of mixed gambles.

Activity in that cluster inversely correlated with decisions to gamble: lower activation corresponded to higher risk taking. Using this cluster as a seed in PPI analyses, we identified a wide range of neural network differences between casual MA users and non-users. Parametric whole brain analyses identified clusters in the ventral striatum, posterior insula and precuneus where activations modulated by risk and reward were significantly weaker in casual MA users than in non-users. The striatal cluster identified in these analyses overlapped with the amygdala-striatal cluster. \n\nThis work identified neural differences in casual MA users' reward processing and outcome learning systems which may underlie their increased real-world risk-taking.

Disorders related to use of amphetamines are second only to those related to opioids. Moreover, according to the available data, methamphetamine represents the highest global health threat among amphetamines ( ). A growing body of research has identified cognitive deficits characteristic of MA abuse/dependence ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, the question whether these differences are pre-existing or caused by methamphetamine use has not yet been answered. Dean and colleagues attempted to address this question ( ) by reviewing evidence from animal studies, cross-sectional human studies, a twin study, studies of changes in cognition with abstinence, studies of changes in brain structure and function with abstinence, and studies examining how severity of MA abuse relates to levels of cognitive decline. Although the authors reported mixed findings, they found some evidence of a causal relationship between MA abuse and cognitive decline. The reported cognitive deficits in the areas of executive functioning ( ), response inhibition ( ) and delay discounting ( ) may be the key contributors to a relapse rate as high as 77% within 5\u202fyears from treatment ( ). Another key change that is likely to contribute to a high relapse rate is the adaptation of the reward processing system: in order to handle the high surge of dopamine that methamphetamine use evokes, the reward system down-regulates its dopamine receptors and becomes less sensitive to rewards ( ;  ). This in turn reduces the salience of non-drug related rewards, so that they become less rewarding in comparison to drug-reward. \n\nFocusing intervention efforts at pre-empting addiction in vulnerable populations seems a more promising strategy, since it would prevent MA-use-induced neurological changes that make recovery so challenging. One approach is studying casual/recreational users, not diagnosed with substance use disorder (SUD). This group may be at high risk for addiction due to their experience with MA. On the other hand, they may be resilient against addiction since they were able to maintain casual use over the years and not become addicted. Understanding their neuro-cognitive characteristics during decision-making and risk-taking would help solve this dilemma and, may help identify intervention strategies. Unfortunately, research on cognitive and neural characteristics of casual MA users is currently lacking, with the vast majority of existing research focusing on addicted individuals. In this paper we are starting to bridge this gap by specifically identifying neurocognitive differences characteristic of casual MA users compared to non-users. This knowledge may also help elucidate the extent to which observed neurocognitive changes in chronic MA users are pre-existing versus meth-use-induced. \n\nAnother challenge when identifying neural patterns specific to methamphetamine users is the co-occurrence of other risky behaviors characteristic of this population; specifically, consistently strong associations exist among binge drinking, methamphetamine use and risky sexual behavior ( ). In this study we employed two strategies in order to disentangle unique behavioral and neural processes related to MA use. First, binge drinkers were excluded from the study. Second, all participants reported involvement in risky sexual behavior; thus, when contrasting differences between MA users and non-user we could isolate unique characteristics of casual MA use. \n\nUnderstanding neural characteristics of casual MA users, particularly during risky decision-making, may help identify addiction-vulnerable phenotypes that could influence treatment response and thus represent novel therapeutic targets ( ). The goal of this paper is to isolate aspects of the decision process that cognitively and neurally distinguish casual MA users from non-users, in order to inform future treatment development. \n\nWe conceptualize the decision-making process as consisting of two phases: the decision phase, where the evaluation and action selection are performed, and the feedback phase for the outcome processing. Although neuro-cognitive processes sub-serving each phase are temporally and functionally distinct, they are supported by the same distributed network, but with its components engaged differently in each phase: amygdala, insula, ventral striatum (VS), dorsal striatum, prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex ACC, pre-supplementary motor area, superior/intraparietal lobule and superior temporal gyrus (STG) ( ;  ). We considered it important to be able to identify the differences in neural processing found between the groups, specific to each phase of the decision-making process. To address this, we used a specially designed decision-making task, the CUPS task ( ) that allowed us to separately examine decision and feedback phases. The CUPS task was similarly used to examine neurocognitive characteristics specific to individuals with internet gambling disorder (IGD) during the decision process ( ). In this work the researchers found weaker risk-modulated activation in dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in the IGD group during the decision phase and greater outcome-related activation in the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), and VS in the IGD participants during outcome processing. \n\nWe hypothesized that risk taking in a laboratory gambling task will be reflective of real-life sexual risk taking; thus, the differences in neuro-cognitive processing of decisions during the task would illuminate the neural characteristics of casual MA users that are linked to their real-life risk-taking behavior. \n\nIn the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we performed a five-step analysis to identify the neuro-cognitive group differences during risky decision making and examine how they relate to risky behavior both during the task and in real life. In step one we used whole brain analysis to identify areas with differential activation in casual MA users, compared to non-users, during decisions and feedback processing. The purpose of step two was to examine whether the identified differences in activation are related to risk-taking in the task, thus we performed an independent ROI analysis, and correlated the average activation in the cluster identified in step one with risk-taking in the task. The goal of step three was to flush out the larger network differences between the groups, to see if there are differences in functional connectivity of the area we identified in step one with the other neural components key to decision-making. Thus, we utilized a generalized form of psycho-physiological interaction analysis ( ), using the ROIs resulting from the whole brain analysis during decisions (step one) as a seed. In step four we wanted to identify areas where activation was modulated by risk or reward differently between the groups. In similar work comparing methamphetamine-dependent individuals with control participants ( ) researchers found differences between the groups in parametric modulation of the activation by risk during risky decisions: in methamphetamine-dependent individuals it was more strongly modulated in VS and more weakly modulated in dlPFC. We wanted to see if casual meth-users demonstrate a similar neuro-behavioral profile as methamphetamine-dependent individuals during risky decisions. To test this we performed two whole brain analyses with parametrically modulated regressors to identify areas where activation modulated by risk or reward differs between the groups. Finally, in step five, we computed a meth-use index and used it as a regressor in a group level whole brain analysis to identify neural areas moderated by intensity of meth use. \n\n\n## Methods and materials \n  \n### Participants \n  \nNinety seven sexually risky men (31 White, 30 Black and 36 Hispanic/Latino; age range 18.2\u201330\u202fyears,   M  \u202f=\u202f25.2\u202fyears) who have sex with men (31 casual MA users and 66 non-users), participants in a larger investigation of neural correlates of risky sexual decision-making in men who have sex with men, were included in this study. SUD diagnoses for any substance other than nicotine, binge drinking (>2 drinks on a weekday or >5 on a weekend), and regular use of any illicit substance except for marijuana were exclusionary (see   for substance use characteristics). Data were collected between 2012 and 2014, prior to widespread use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs to inhibit HIV infection, thus unprotected sex carried a serious risk of HIV infection. Since methamphetamine use is prevalent in this population ( ), one goal of the larger project was to identify possible neural correlates associated with methamphetamine use; thus we targeted 33% of the recruited subjects to be MA users. We recruited 177 participants using internet advertisements, 155 of whom participated in this task. Three participants were removed because no valid structural data was collected from them. Along with other measures, participants reported the number of risky sexual occurrences (defined as an instance of condomless anal sex) in the past 90\u202fdays, (range\u202f=\u202f0 to 89 instances); this value was used as their real-world sexual risk-taking index. Participants were recruited into three groups based on this real-world sexual risk-taking index and methamphetamine use: safe (# risky sex occurrences\u202f=\u202f0;   N  \u202f=\u202f50), sexually risky (# risk sex occurrences >0) non-users (  N  \u202f=\u202f66) and sexually risky MA users (  N  \u202f=\u202f37). Since the purpose of the current study was to isolate the neural mechanisms associated with MA use from those associated with risky sexual behavior we only included the participants from the two risky groups. Participants were considered MA users if they self-reported MA use at any point in their life, even if currently abstinent. One participant originally assigned to the MA group was excluded due to a contradiction in his MA-use history that made it unclear whether he was a user or not. Due to our focus on casual MA use, we evaluated MA group participants in accordance with DSM 5 diagnostic criteria of substance use disorder ( ) that included, in addition to frequency and length of use, cravings, withdrawal symptoms, impact on life and overdose history, in order to identify the participants who may currently suffer from addiction or have suffered in the past and were not included as casual MA users. Based on these criteria, we excluded 5 participants, leaving 31 participants in the casual MA group. Informed consent was obtained from each participant before the experiment. The protocol of the study was approved by the University Institutional Review Board.   \nResearch participants substance use characteristics. \n  Table 1     \n\n\n\n## fMRI CUPS task \n  \nWhile undergoing fMRI, participants performed the modified CUPS task ( ;  ), in which they had to decide whether to accept or refuse a series of mixed gambles. In each trial participants were presented with a set of cups (3 to 11). They were informed that one of the cups contained a gain (amount ranging between $3 and $8) and the rest of the cups contained a loss of $1, and they were asked to accept or reject the gamble ( ). When the gamble was accepted, the participant was informed of the gain or loss after a short waiting period. When the gamble was rejected, the participant did not win or lose any money. When no selection was made during the response window, the participant lost $1.   \nCUPS task. \n  Fig. 1   \n\nThe probability and magnitude of the potential gain were independently manipulated so that it created three expected value (EV) based categories: risk equivalent (RE, EV\u202f=\u202f0, e.g., $6 gain in one cup and $1 loss in 6 cups), risk advantageous (RA, EV\u202f>\u202f0, e.g., $8 gain in one cup and $1 loss in 6 cups) and risk disadvantageous (RD, EV\u202f<\u202f0, e.g., $6 gain in one cup and $1 loss in 8 cups). Half of the gambles were RE, one third of the other half of the gambles were RD, and the rest were RA. \n\nFirst the gamble was presented for the participant to contemplate, but no action was expected or accepted. After a variable delay (mean 3\u202fs, ranging from 1.5 to 5\u202fs, drawn from an exponential distribution), the response options appeared and participants were required to respond within 3\u202fs, otherwise they would lose $1. The position of the response cue varied from trial to trial to prevent preplanned motor response at the decision stage. After the response and a variable delay (2.5 to 6\u202fs, mean 4\u202fs), the participant was informed of the gamble resolution (presented for 0.5\u202fs). During the variable inter-trial interval (mean 2.5\u202fs, ranged from 1 to 4.5\u202fs), the fixation cross was presented. \n\nThe accumulated win/loss total was displayed once at the end of the task. Participants received their winnings at the end of the experiment; however, participants who ended up with a net loss did not actually lose money. The task consisted of 72 trials and lasted 12\u202fmin. \n\nThe intervals between the trials, the delays between gamble presentation and decision acceptance, and gamble resolution delays were randomly jittered and the sequence was optimized for design efficiency ( ;  ) using an in-house program. \n\n### Functional imaging procedure \n  \nParticipants lay supine in the scanner, and viewed visual stimuli back-projected onto a screen through a mirror attached to the head coil. Foam pads were utilized to minimize head motion. Stimulus presentation and timing of all stimuli and response events were controlled by Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.) programs based on Psychtoolbox ( ) extensions on a MacBook Pro. Participants' responses were collected online using an MRI-compatible button box. Participants completed the CUPS task as part of a larger battery of structural and functional MRI data collection for approximately 1.2\u202fh of scanning (task order during the session stayed constant for all the participants) in a 3\u202fT Siemens MAGNETOM Tim Trio scanner. A T1-weighted anatomical image, a set of diffusion-weighted images, and several task-related functional image sequences were collected. Task-related fMRI data were acquired using T2*-weighted (TR\u202f=\u202f2000\u202fms, TE\u202f=\u202f25\u202fms, 64\u202f\u00d7\u202f64 matrix size with a resolution of 3\u202fmm , using 41 3.0-mm axial slices) imaging. \n\n\n### fMRI data preprocessing and statistical analysis \n  \nImage preprocessing and statistical analysis were carried out using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) version 6.00, part of the FSL package (FMRIB software library, version 4.1.8,  ). The data were temporally filtered using a non-linear high pass filter with a 100\u202fs cut-off, and spatially smoothed using a 5\u202fmm full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. A two-step registration procedure was used whereby images were first registered to the MPRAGE structural image, and then into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute MNI-152\u202fT1 template brain, using affine transformations with FLIRT ( ;  ). Registration from MPRAGE structural images to standard space was further refined using FNIRT nonlinear registration ( ). Statistical analyses were performed in the native image space, with the statistical maps normalized to the standard space prior to higher-level analysis. Melodic ICA was used to de-noise the preprocessed functional data ( ). The FIX software package was used to automatically identify noise components ( ;  ). \n\nData were modeled at the first level using a general linear model within FSL's FILM module. In the whole brain analysis, four predictors of interest (2 trial types based on the decision to take risk (risky\u202f=\u202fgamble accepted, non-risky\u202f=\u202fgamble rejected) X 2 phases: (decision\u202f=\u202ftime from the gamble display to the button press to accept or reject (2\u20138\u202fs), feedback\u202f=\u202ftime when gamble resolution was displayed (0.5\u202fs)) were modeled separately. We modeled the main effect of each type of decision for each decision phase by contrasting against baseline (inter-trial break periods when fixation cross was displayed) as well as contrasts between risky and non-risky trials for each phase. At the group level we examined whether any lower-level effects differed between casual MA users and non-users. \n\n\n### Generalized psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis \n  \nPsychophysiological interaction analysis (PPI) can provide information about functional integration of the brain under certain contexts, such as task condition ( ). Here, we used a generalized PPI approach [( )] to identify regions whose connectivity differs between the groups on the basis of task conditions. Like other functional connectivity approaches, generalized PPI computes connectivity between a seed region and other voxels in the brain, where seed, as in the original PPI, is usually a region significantly activated in the task in the same data set ( ;  ). However, unlike the original method, generalized PPI can use all available data in the estimation of connectivity. By modeling the entire experimental space, this approach provides a better model fit and achieves greater sensitivity and specificity than the original method of PPI ( ). Thus, compared to the traditional PPI method, the generalized PPI (further referred to as PPI) can help reduce the probabilities of both false positives and false negatives. \n\nAn amygdala-striatal cluster identified during the whole brain analysis, where activation during the decisions was attenuated in casual MA users compared to non-users ( ), was used as the seed region in the PPI analyses. In these analyses, we first transformed the PPI seed region of interest (ROI) into the native space for each participant. The time course of the seed ROI was then extracted. Next, a PPI model was set up to explore effective connectivity between the seed ROI and other voxels in the brain. Nine covariates were included in this model, including the same four predictors used in the whole brain analysis (2 trial types based on the decision to take risk: risk/non-risk X 2 phases: decision and feedback) as the psychological factors, time course of the seed region as the physiological factor, four interaction covariates between the psychological and physiological factors. In addition to the main effect for each phase, two contrasts were set up in the first level model to examine PPI difference between risky and non-risky trials during decision and feedback processing.   \nWhole brain analysis, results of the decision phase where non-users' activation is higher than casual meth-users'. \n  Fig. 2   \n\n\n### Whole brain analyses with risk and reward as parametric modulators \n  \nIn order to identify brain areas differentially modulated by risk or potential reward between the groups, we performed two whole brain analyses with parametric modulators. Four parametric regressors  (2 trial types based on the decision to take risk X 2 phases, decision & feedback) were used in each analysis; the risk parameter in analysis 1 was represented by the number of cups, the gain parameter in analysis 2 was represented by the potential win amount. As in the first whole brain analysis discussed above, we modeled the main effect of each trial type at each phase by contrasting against baseline as well as computing the contrasts between risky and non-risky trials for each phase. At the group level we examined whether any lower-level effects differed between casual MA users and non-users. \n\n\n### Meth-use index analysis \n  \nWe used the following algorithm to compute the meth-use index, a continuous variable representing individual differences in the severity of use across participants: \n\nif never used set index to 0, if ever used start with 1, if use initiated before age of 18 add 1, if current user (used in the last 3\u202fmonths) add 2, if used > 10 times in the last 3\u202fmonth add 2. This resulted in a range of use from 0 to 6. We used demeaned meth-use index as a covariate in the group level analysis. \n\nAll group analyses (whole brain, PPI and meth-index), were performed using random-effects FLAME (FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed Effects) stage 1 simple mixed effect model ( ;  ;  ). Group images were then thresholded using cluster detection statistics with a height threshold of   z  \u202f>\u202f2.3 and a cluster probability of   p  \u202f<\u202f.05, corrected for whole-brain multiple comparisons using Gaussian Random Field Theory. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nThere were no significant differences in the risk taken, response time, number of misses, amount or number of wins or losses between the groups. However, casual MA users took marginally more risk in the task (M\u202f=\u202f0.54) then non-users (M\u202f=\u202f0.46), Mdiff\u202f=\u202f0.08, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f[\u22120.157, 0.004],   p  \u202f=\u202f.06 and lost (marginally) more money (M\u202f=\u202f27.03) then non-users(M\u202f=\u202f23.00), Mdiff\u202f=\u202f4.03, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f[\u22128.66, 0.6.],   p  \u202f=\u202f.086. Real-life sexual risk taking, significantly correlated with risk taking in the laboratory CUPS task (measured as ratio of risky choices to all trials) across all subjects, r(95)\u202f=\u202f0.27,   p  \u202f=\u202f.007. This relationship was driven by participants' behavior on risk-equivalent trials (EV\u202f=\u202f0), r(95)\u202f=\u202f0.29,   p  \u202f=\u202f.004. \n\n\n### fMRI results \u2013 Whole brain analysis \n  \nDuring the decision phase, averaging across all trials, we found weaker BOLD response in casual MA users (compared to non-users) on the right side in the amygdala, nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and surrounding ventral regions of the putamen and caudate (or ventral striatum) ( ,  ). No differences were observed when contrasting risky and non-risky trials or examining each type of trial (risky/non-risky) separately; no differences were found during the feedback phase.   \nWhole brain analysis results during evaluation phase where activation for non-users was higher than for meth-users. The value in the \u201cmax\u201d column is the maximum z-stat in each local maxima. X, Y, and Z are x, y, and z coordinates in MNI-152 space in mm. Cluster size is   260   voxels. \n  Table 2   \n\n\n### ROI analysis and decision to gamble \n  \nTo examine whether the activation in the amygdala-striatal ROI differentiating casual MA users and non-users during decisions was related to the choice to gamble or not, we conducted an independent ROI analysis by extracting the percent signal change for each subject (  N  \u202f=\u202f97). The amygdala-striatal ROI was defined as group difference (non-users > MA users) during the gamble evaluation (time from the moment the gamble is displayed till the user presses the button with his selection) for all trials (both risky and non-risky trials included, so risk taking is not part of the ROI selection). It was correlated with the average risk taken in the task (average risk calculated as the ratio of accepted gambles to number of trials). We found a significant negative effect (  r  \u202f=\u202f\u22120.31,   p  \u202f=\u202f.002), so that the stronger the activation in the amygdala-striatal ROI was associated with less within-task risk. \n\n\n\n## fMRI results \u2013 Generalized PPI analysis \n  \nDuring the decision phase, averaging across all trials, casual MA users had stronger connectivity between the amygdala-striatal seed region and the vmPFC than non-users. Non-users on the other hand, had stronger connectivity between the amygdala-striatal seed region and the posterior insular cortex (PIC), STG and middle temporal gyrus (MTG) ( ,  ) than did casual MA users. When isolating the decisions on which participants subsequently decided to take risk (risky trials) from those they didn't (non-risky trials), we found no difference in connectivity with the amygdala-striatal seed region during the trials when risk was taken. However, during the non-risky trials non-users had stronger connectivity of seed ROI with PIC, MTG, medial frontal gyrus (MFG), and inferior temporal gyrus (ITG). Similarity of these results for non-risky trials with the ones for all trials, suggests that all trial's results are likely driven by the non-risky trials. When contrasting non-risky and risky trials, non-users had stronger connectivity between the seed ROI and clusters in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and MFG.   \nPsycho-physiological interaction analysis results during decision phase. \n  Fig. 3     \nPsycho-physiological interaction analysis results during evaluation phase.

The number of voxels in the cluster is recorded in the \u201cvoxels\u201d column. \n  Table 3   \n\nDuring the feedback phase, stronger connectivity between the amygdala-striatal seed region and the vmPFC, including the medial orbitofrontal area, dlPFC and ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC), and IFG was evident in non-users ( ,  ) compared to casual MA users. Examining risky and non-risky trials separately we found stronger connectivity between the amygdala-striatal seed region and the PIC, vmPFC, and IFG during non-risky trials and stronger connectivity between the amygdala-striatal seed region and the vmPFC, vlPFC and IFG during risky trials in non-users compared to casual MA users.   \nPsycho-physiological interaction analysis results during feedback phase. \n  Fig. 4     \nPsycho-physiological interaction analysis results during feedback phase. Each row refers to activity related to one cluster. The value in the \u201cmax\u201d column is the maximum z-stat in each cluster. X, Y, and Z are x, y, and z coordinates in MNI-152 space in mm. The number of voxels in the cluster is recorded in the \u201cvoxels\u201d column. \n  Table 4   \n\n### Post-hoc behavioral analysis \n  \nStronger connectivity of the amygdala-striatal ROI in casual MA users with the vmPFC, an area responsible for value calculation ( ), and in non-users with the insula, a region implicated in risk processing ( ), during decision, suggested the possibility that casual MA users were more focused on the potential gains and non-users were more attuned to possible risks, represented in the task by the number of cups. Therefore, we conducted additional analyses of the behavioral data to explore this idea further. We ran logistic regression with repeated measures using the glmer function from the lme4 package in R, fitting a general linear model using the maximum likelihood method. We regressed the decision to accept the gamble (risk) on group (casual MA users vs. non-users), number of cups, potential gain, trial type and all interactions. To ensure that adding the interaction terms significantly improves the model, we also fitted a model without interaction terms and compared the two models using a log likelihood ratio test (using the ANOVA function in R). Akaike Information Criterion (AIC;  ) values as well as Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC;  ) were used along with chi square to identify the model with a better fit. This revealed the superiority of the model with interaction terms, since it had lower AIC/BIC and p (chi square)\u202f<\u202f0.001 ( ). We were particularly interested in the interactions between group and the potential gain and between group and the number of cups. The interaction of group and number of cups turned out to be significant (  p  \u202f<\u202f.001). We proceeded with stratifying by group and found that while for non-users both potential gain and number of cups were significant predictors of risk, for casual MA users only potential gain but not the number of cups was a predictor ( ).   \nParameters for model fit evaluation for post hoc logistical regression analysis. \n  Table 5       \nResults of logistical regression of decision to accept the gamble (risk) on potential gain, number of cups and EV category stratified by group. \n  Table 6   \n\n\n### Whole brain analyses with risk and reward as parametric modulators \n  \nTo examine the full spectrum of neural differences in processing risk and potential reward between the groups, we performed two parametrically modulated fMRI analyses, one identifying activation modulated by risk (number of cups) and one identifying activation modulated by potential reward. It revealed that during the decision phase, on non-risky trials, non-users had higher risk-modulated and gain-modulated activation in the ventral striatum (a cluster within the amygdala-striatal ROI differentiating non-users and casual MA users during the decision phase), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), PIC, precuneus and cuneal cortex ( ,  ,  ,  ). Similar differences were evident when contrasting non-risky and risky trials.   \nWhole brain analysis with risk (number of cups) as parametric modulator during evaluation phase.

The observed significant correlation of the amount of risk participants took during the experimental task and real-life sexual risk (measured by amount of condomless anal sex over the previous 90\u202fdays) suggests that our findings may generalize to real-life risk-taking behavior. An examination of the behavioral and neuroimaging findings suggests that casual MA users may have a lower risk sensitivity compared to non-users. Specifically, both groups considered the magnitude of the potential win but only non-users consider the chances of winning while making their decisions. \n\nOur research suggested that an amygdala-striatal cluster could be the key to the neural differences underlying risk related decisions in casual MA users. This cluster emerged as a group differentiator during the decisions in a whole brain analysis with weaker activation in casual meth-users. In light of previous findings suggesting this area's role in reward evaluation ( ;  ;  ), reward prediction and error computation ( ;  ;  ), the current findings may suggest that casual MA users' behavior during the task arises from a deregulated reward processing system. \n\nWeaker striatal activation is consistent with the neuroadaptation characteristic of chronic MA users ( ,  ). Since MA users in our study are casual users there are two possible explanations of this finding: (1) adaptation of the reward system happens rapidly enough with methamphetamine use so that it manifests itself even in casual users, and (2) weaker neural response to reward may be a pre-existing characteristic of methamphetamine users. Correlational whole brain analysis of meth use intensity also revealed a cluster in the ventral striatum where higher intensity of use corresponded to weaker activation during decisions, thus providing support for the first explanation. This explanation also aligns well with prior research that found a disruption of value-related signals after a single MA challenge ( ). \n\nOur parametrically modulated analyses also supports the deregulation of reward-system hypothesis: it identified a striatal cluster (overlapping with the amygdala-striatal cluster found in the whole brain analysis) where risk- and reward-modulated activation was stronger in non-users compared to casual MA users during decisions that resulted in safe choices (as contrasted with risky choices or baseline,  ). Interestingly these results differ from the prior work that examined differences in risk-modulated activation between methamphetamine-dependent individuals and controls ( ), that reported no difference in risk-modulation between the groups during safe events (  cash outs   in Balloon Analog Reward Task, BART). On the other hand, they found higher risk-modulated activation in VS and weaker risk-modulated activation in dlPFC in methamphetamine-dependent group on risky trials (  active balloon pumps   in BART), where we found no group difference on risky trials. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions when comparing the results from two such differently designed studies, these findings point to possible differences between casual meth-users and methamphetamine-dependent individuals that can be tested in future studies.   \nCombined results of 3 whole brain analyses during decision phase where activation in non-users was greater that in casual meth-users, from  ,  ,  ) identifying the overlapping areas: (1) - All trials contrasted with baseline, (2) \u2013 risk-modulated activation in safe trials contrasted with risky trials, (3) \u2013 reward-modulated activation in safe trials contrasted with risky trials. \n  Fig. 8   \n\nNovel to the current investigation, the activation in the amygdala-striatal cluster during decisions significantly predicted how much risk participants took in the task, such that higher activation corresponded to less risk taking. This finding is somewhat paradoxical, since it shows that lesser activation in the reward area led to higher gambling. One possible explanation may be that people with lower phasic levels of dopamine ( ), resulting in lower activation in striatal areas, are more reward-seeking in order to elicit homeostatic compensation and increase overall dopaminergic activity, which results in a generally higher level of risk taking. \n\nTo further examine this possible reward system deficit we performed a generalized PPI analysis using this cluster as the seed region. This analysis uncovered further neural-network differences between the groups. Specifically, during the decisions the connectivity of the amygdala-striatal cluster was stronger in casual MA users with the vmPFC and in non-users with the insular cortex (IC), IFG and MFG. We theorize that these connectivity differences may reflect different cognitive processes underlying decision-making. Since the vmPFC has been implicated in value calculation ( ), the greater vmPFC-amygdala-striatal connectivity in casual MA users during decision-making could reflect a focus on the value of choices; this increased connectivity may also be a compensatory measure that balances the weaker amygdala-striatal activation in casual MA users. \n\nIn contrast, the IC has been implicated in risk assessment and risk prediction error calculation ( ), the IFG in risk related inhibition of the suboptimal choices ( ) and MFG in response inhibition ( ), suggesting that the increased connectivity among these regions in non-users may reflect a greater focus on the risk of a choice, as represented by the likelihood of potential outcomes, and inhibition of reward seeking response. Converging evidence for this hypothesis comes from the parametrically modulated analysis, which revealed risk-modulated activation in insula during safe trials was stronger in non-users than casual MA users. The behavioral analysis supports this as well, since the potential gain amount equally strongly predicted the gambling decisions for casual MA users and non-users whereas the risk represented by the number of cups was only a significant predictor for non-users. \n\nThe somatic marker hypothesis [SMH, ( )] considers the vmPFC a repository of the linkage between factual knowledge and bioregulatory states and a substrate for learning the association between a complex situation and an emotional state during our experiences ( ). When similar situations are encountered, these somatic markers are invoked and the emotional responses are re-enacted, providing for optimal decision-making. SMH is operative during the feedback phase of decision-making, since the function of this phase is to learn the actual values of options for the goal of adaptive behavior ( ). Weaker connectivity of the amygdala-striatal cluster with the key neural components necessary for successful somatic marker association ( ;  ), the vmPFC, working memory processing (dlPFC), and somato-emotional processing (IC), in casual MA users during feedback processing may suggest deregulation of the critical learning mechanism that impacts sub-optimal choice during following decisions. \n\n\n## Concluding remarks \n  \nThe current paper employed a network-based approach to isolate several key differences that may contribute to drug use in casual MA users. First, a dysregulation of the reward processing system was evident during the decision phase. We identified an amygdala-striatal cluster with attenuated activation in casual MA users compared to non-users during decisions in general, and, the striatal portion of this cluster had attenuated risk and reward modulated activation. Moreover, activation in this cluster was predictive of risk taking so that higher activation related to lesser risk taking. Our analysis suggests that when making decisions, non-users took into consideration both the potential gain and riskiness of the gambles, whereas casual MA users focused primarily on potential gain. On a neural level these behavioral findings are supported by stronger risk modulated activation in IC in non-users and higher functional connectivity of the amygdala-striatal cluster with the IC, MFG and IFG in non-users and the vmPFC in casual MA users. Second, during the feedback phase, weaker connectivity of the amygdala-striatal region with the vmPFC, dlPFC and PIC in casual MA users could indicate a suboptimal feedback processing and outcome learning mechanisms. Finally, the correlation of risk taking in the task with real-life self-reported sexual risk taking suggests that these uncovered differences in reward processing and outcome learning may also underlie real-life risky behavior in casual MA users. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6411911, "text_md5": "8bd8161ee983ce3bc9dd10cdf8d51278", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 188], "journal": [189, 204], "publication_year": [206, 210], "title": [221, 293], "keywords": [307, 374], "abstract": [387, 3238], "body": [3247, 42309]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 30612937, "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2018.101643", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6411911", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6411911"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6411911\">6411911</a>", "list_title": "PMC6411911  Neurocognitive decision-making processes of casual methamphetamine users"}

Peer presence increases adolescent risk taking, associated with greater reward-related activity, while parental presence decreases risk taking, associated with decreased reward-related activity and increased cognitive control. Yet the effects specific to peers and parents are still unknown. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study compared within-person peer and parent influences on risky decision-making during adolescence (ages 12\u201315\u00a0years;   N  \u00a0=\u00a056). Participants completed the Yellow Light Game (YLG), a computerized driving task, during which they could make safe or risky decisions, in the presence of a peer and their parent. Behavioral findings revealed no effects of social context on risk taking. At the neural level, a collection of affective, social and cognitive regions [ventral striatum (VS), temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)] was more active during decision-making with peers than parents. Additionally, functional connectivity analyses showed greater coupling between affective, social and cognitive control regions (VS-insula, VS-TPJ) during decision-making with parents than peers. These findings highlight the complex nature of social influence processes in peer and parent contexts, and contribute to our understanding of the opportunities and vulnerabilities associated with adolescent social sensitivity. \n \n\n# Body\n \nAdolescence is characterized by heightened social-affective sensitivity and substantial increases in risk-taking behaviors (Crone and Dahl,  ; Blakemore and Mills,  ; Patton   et al  .,  ; Van Duijvenvoorde   et al.,  ). As such, adolescent decision-making is a topic of common interest among parents and policy makers, as well as developmental neuroscientists, who aim to leverage an understanding of brain development to inform adolescent health (Dahl   et al.,  ; Fuligni   et al.,  ). Changes in the developing brain reorient adolescents towards social cues, making them especially sensitive to their social context, such as in the presence of parents or peers (Blakemore and Mills,  ; Nelson   et al.,  ; Scriber and Guyer,  ). Although previous neuroimaging research has examined how the presence of peers (Chein   et al.  ,  )   or   parents (Telzer   et al.  ,  ) impacts adolescent risk taking, no study to date has directly compared these social influences on risk taking within the same group of adolescents, a significant limitation given that prior approaches cannot disentangle the effects specific to each source of social influence. The current fMRI study aimed to fill this gap in the literature by comparing   within-person   peer and parent influences on risky decision-making. \n\nThe adolescent social world is characterized by increased salience of peer relations, importance of fitting, in and attunement to social evaluation (Somerville,  ; Lam   et al.  ,  ; Blakemore,  ). In the presence of peers, adolescents display greater risk taking in several health-risk domains, including risky driving, gambling and smoking (Gardner and Steinberg,  ; Loke   et al.  ,  ; Van Hoorn   et al.  ,  ). The increase in risk-taking behaviors with peers is paralleled by heightened activation in reward-related regions, including the ventral striatum (VS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), in adolescents but not (young) adults (Chein   et al  .,  ). This suggests that risk taking in the presence of peers may be more rewarding and salient during adolescence, an effect that seems specific to risk-taking, as peer presence does not disrupt neural activity during response inhibition (Smith   et al.  ,  ). Together, this work highlights that adolescents\u2019 social-affective sensitivities may place them in a position of vulnerability for increased health-risk behaviors in the presence of their peers. \n\nAlthough adolescents\u2019 social reorientation involves moving towards their peers and becoming independent from parents (Nelson   et al  .,  ; Nelson   et al  .,  ), the family still plays a large role in shaping adolescents\u2019 behaviors and attitudes (Tsai   et al  .,  ; Telzer   et al  .,  ; Van Ryzin   et al  .,  ). Indeed, the presence of mothers reduces adolescents\u2019 risky behavior relative to being alone, and this is modulated by greater activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) during safe decisions, and decreased VS activation following risky decisions (Telzer   et al  .,  ). Buffering of risk-taking behaviors is specific to mothers, as unfamiliar adults relative to mothers do not seem to have this protective effect (Guassi Moreira and Telzer,  ; but see Silva   et al  .,   for a decrease in risk taking in a group of one young adult and peers relative to a group of solely peers). Collectively, this work suggests that parental presence may serve as a buffer to dissuade adolescents from engaging in risky behaviors (Telzer   et al  .,  ), such that social-affective sensitivities may also constitute an opportunity for positive influences on development (Scriber and Guyer,  ; Dahl   et al  .,  ; Telzer   et al  .,  ). \n\nUnderstanding the different roles of peers and parents in adolescent risk taking is crucial to gain a better grasp on the opportunities and vulnerabilities associated with adolescent sensitivity to social contexts. The presence of peers and parents has the potential to impact risky behavior through their modulation of affective, cognitive control and social-cognitive processes in the brain. Indeed, the regions associated with these processes are intimately involved in risk-taking, particularly in a social context. For instance, reward-related regions such as the VS, OFC and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) are consistently activated across risk-taking and social influence tasks (Chein   et al  .  ; Telzer   et al  .,  ; Welborn   et al  .,  ; Telzer   et al  .,  ), underscoring how social contexts can modulate the rewarding and salient nature of risk taking. Cognitive control-related regions, such as the vlPFC and dlPFC, are also implicated in the context of risk taking, serving as a neural brake to decrease risky choices, whereas the insula serves as a neural hub that integrates reward-related and cognitive processes, especially in the context of risky decision-making (Blakemore,  ; Lamm and Singer,  ; Smith   et al  .,  ,  ). Social influence on attitudes and behaviors also instantiates mentalizing about other people\u2019s social norms, values and expectations, which is facilitated by social-cognitive regions such as the TPJ and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) (Somerville   et al  .,  ; Blakemore and Mills,  ; Welborn   et al  .,  ; Van Hoorn   et al.  ,  ). \n\nThese neural regions implicated in social influence are part of complex and dynamically interacting neural circuits (Casey,  ), and functional coupling between affective, cognitive and social regions affects adolescent risk-taking behavior. Indeed, functional coupling between the VS and prefrontal cortex has been linked to a decrease in risky behavior (Qu   et al  .,  ), and can be modulated by the social context, such as parental presence (Telzer   et al  .,  ; Guassi Moreira and Telzer,  ). There is also initial evidence for the involvement of functional connectivity between VS and TPJ after social exclusion by peers in a risky context (Peake   et al  .,  ). As such, we take a complementary approach, examining the neural correlates of parent and peer presence on affective, cognitive control and social brain regions, as well as functional coupling of these regions, to gain traction on adolescent risk-taking in social contexts. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe final sample for analyses included 56 early adolescents (  M  (  s.d.  )\u00a0=\u00a013.2(0.69)\u00a0years, range 12.08\u201314.82\u00a0years, 26 females). An additional five participants were excluded due to excessive motion (  n  \u00a0=\u00a02; >2.0\u00a0mm inter-slice movement on \u226510% of slices) or technical difficulties in acquiring data for parent or peer runs (  n  \u00a0=\u00a03). Moreover,   n  \u00a0=\u00a013 additional participants were excluded because they did not have enough behavioral data (i.e. stop or go decisions) to model at the neural level, which is detailed in the task section below. The age range was based on previous work (Gardner and Steinberg,  ) and recent evidence suggesting that across development, early adolescents (ages 12\u201314) are most susceptible to social influence, for better or for worse (Knoll   et al  .,  ; Van Hoorn   et al  .,  ). Participants were recruited via local schools, community flyers and Listservs. They were from diverse ethnic backgrounds, including White (  n  \u00a0=\u00a031, 55%), African American (  n  \u00a0=\u00a010, 18%), Asian (  n  \u00a0=\u00a04, 7%), mixed race (  n  \u00a0=\u00a09, 16%) and other (  n  \u00a0=\u00a02, 4%). \n\nWe screened participants to ensure they were free from neurological disorders, taking psychotropic medication, or any MRI contraindications. Based on parent report, a small subset of our sample had a lifetime history of a psychological disorder: attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder (AD(H)D)   n  \u00a0=\u00a04 (7 %); anxiety n\u00a0=\u00a01 (2%); ADHD and anxiety   n  \u00a0=\u00a01 (2%); depression and anxiety   n  \u00a0=\u00a01 (2%) . If participants were taking AD(H)D medication, they were asked to refrain from taking their medication for a 24\u00a0h period before their scan. Participants were accompanied to the scan by their primary caregiver, which included mostly biological mothers (73%), fathers (16%), or other legal guardians, such as adoptive parents or grandparent (11%). All participants and their legal guardians provided written consent and assent, and the Institutional Review Board of the University of Illinois at Champaign\u2013Urbana approved all procedures. \n\n\n### Manipulation of social context: peers and parents \n  \nDuring a behavioral session, a week or more prior to the scan session, each participant\u2019s photo was taken, and they completed a short bio indicating their grade, their favorite subject in school and what they liked to do for fun. When they arrived to the scan, they were shown a picture of an age-, race- and gender-matched peer and received the peer\u2019s bio, who was ostensibly also completing the study and undergoing their own brain scan. The participant was told that the peer was currently completing a brain scan, and would be playing the same game [a computerized driving game; see task description YLG below] as the participant. After participants practiced two rounds of the YLG themselves, the researcher communicated via cell phone to the scan tech, who indicated the peer was ready to begin the task in the scanner. The participant was then given a notecard to read to the peer through the cell phone: \u2018Hi, this is [PARTICIPANT\u2019S NAME], and I\u2019ll be watching you play this round\u2019. The participant then saw a \u2018live feed\u2019 of the peer supposedly playing the YLG in the scanner, which was in fact a recording of a game set to be a representative teen\u2019s behavior [choosing to go 50% of the time, which was based on a similar peer manipulation (Kahn   et al.  ,  ) and the \u2018average\u2019 peer in prior work (Peake   et al.  ,  )]. \n\nDuring their scan, participants completed the YLG. In the   Peer Presence   condition, the participant was told that the same peer would be watching them play now; they essentially \u2018switched roles\u2019 with the peer. The experimenter then played an audio recording of the same script from this supposed peer, telling the participant they were watching them play this round. In the   Parent Presence   condition, the participant was told their parent would be entering the scan room to watch them play. The parent spoke through the intercom using the identical script as the peer, a method we have employed in prior studies to examine social influence on risk taking (Telzer   et al  .,  ; Guassi Moreira and Telzer,  ; Guassi Moreira and Telzer,  ). The social context conditions were counterbalanced across participants. \n\n\n### Risk-taking paradigm \n  \nThe YLG (Op de Macks   et al  .,  ) is an adaption of the widely used Stoplight Task (Gardner and Steinberg,  ; Chein   et al  .,  ;) that examines risk-taking at the behavioral and neural level. In the YLG, participants were asked to drive a virtual car from the driver\u2019s point of view along a straight track, during which they encountered several intersections with yellow lights ( ). They were instructed that the goal of the game was to get through all of the intersections in the shortest amount of time. At each intersection, participants had to indicate by button press whether they wanted to accelerate and go through the yellow light (go decision) or brake before arriving at the intersection (stop decision). Deciding to accelerate through the intersection\u2014a go decision\u2014constitutes a risky decision, and could result either in a successful go associated with no delay (i.e. if there was no other car passing through the intersection), or a delay of 5\u00a0s in the event of a crash (i.e. if there was another car passing through the intersection). A successful go was shown on the screen with a blue tilde and a positive chiming sound ( ), whereas a crash was shown as a cracked car window, honking car and crash sound ( ). At the behavioral level, we assessed risk taking as the percentage of go decisions out of the total decisions made (i.e. stop and go were exact opposites). \n  \nIllustration of the YLG and social context conditions. \n  \nBraking before the intersection\u2014a stop decision\u2014resulted in a 2.5\u00a0s delay and constitutes a safe decision because participants avoided a potential crash. After a stop decision, participants either saw an approaching car and heard a honking noise (i.e. necessary stop, because going would have resulted in a crash;  ), or an empty intersection (i.e. unnecessary stop, because going would have been successful;  ). At the behavioral level, safe decisions were defined as the percentage of stop decisions out of the total decisions made. Finally, if participants did not make a decision, this resulted in a 1\u00a0s delay, a red X on the screen and an error noise ( ). \n\nParticipants played the YLG in the MRI scanner while alone, in presence of a peer and in the presence of a parent. In the current paper, we focused on the   Peer presence   and   Parental presence   conditions, because comparisons with an alone condition have been described in previous work (peer\u00a0>\u00a0alone, Chein   et al  .,  ; parent\u00a0>\u00a0alone, Telzer   et al  .,  ), and the alone condition is part of a separate manuscript focused on individual differences (Rogers   et al  .,  ). Participants completed two runs for each social context condition, which were counterbalanced across participants. Within each run, participants encountered 20 intersections, totaling 40 trials for each social context condition. The onset of the yellow light was 1500\u00a0ms after the previous trial which corresponded to a varying distance on the track (200\u2013250\u00a0ft) to avoid predictability. While the runs were varied in terms of probability of crashes for each intersection, the probability of crashing was kept at 50% for each run, and all participants completed the exact same runs in the scanner for consistency. Before entering the scanner, participants were trained on how to properly play the task by completing two practice runs in order to account for learning effects (Kahn   et al  .,  ). The practice runs were based on the same parameters as the scanner task, but unbeknownst to the participants, were slightly different in terms of the no-decisions. To dissuade participants from not responding, no-decisions were paired with a larger 5\u00a0s delay in the practice runs (the shorter 1\u00a0s delay in the scan runs was not explicitly told to participants). \n\nWe used stringent quality control criteria in order to model high-quality fMRI data with a sufficient number of trials. Participants were excluded from analyses if they had (a) more than four no-decision trials within one run and/or (b) fewer than four go or stop decisions within one run. More than four no-decisions were considered problematic because this suggested that the participant was disengaged from the task, generating both invalid behavioral and neural data. This cutoff was determined based on the total number of trials in a run (i.e. 20), such that participants were included only if they had least 75% of the trials with decisions in order to properly fit the fMRI model. Moreover, participants were excluded when they made fewer than four go or stop decisions in a peer or parent run, in order to effectively model risky and safe decisions for parent and peer conditions. Based on these criteria, our final sample excluded   n  \u00a0=\u00a03 adolescents for having more than four no-decision trials in a run,   n  \u00a0=\u00a07 for having fewer than four go or stop decisions in a peer or parent run and   n  \u00a0=\u00a03 for having both exclusion criteria. Of note, we also ran our analyses with a slightly less stringent threshold (i.e. including those with fewer than four go/stop decisions), using a strategy of reweighting the data where possible. Although results with this sample yielded nearly identical results, it also added more noise, such that the intrinsic smoothness of the residual file was significantly higher. Thus, to present the cleanest data, we used the conservative exclusion criteria presented above. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nData were collected with a 3-T Siemens Trio MRI scanner, using a 32-channel head coil. The task was presented on a computer screen, which participants could see through a mirror attached to the head coil. We obtained the functional data using T2 -weighted echoplanar images (EPI; slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0mm; 38 slices; TR\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0sec; TE\u00a0=\u00a025\u00a0ms; matrix\u00a0=\u00a092\u00a0\u00d7\u00a092; FOV\u00a0=\u00a0230\u00a0mm; voxel size 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm ). In order to provide an anatomical reference, structural scans were also acquired, including a T2 -weighted, matched-bandwidth (MBW; TR\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0s; TE\u00a0=\u00a064\u00a0ms; FOV\u00a0=\u00a0230; matrix\u00a0=\u00a0192\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0192; slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0mm; 38 slices) and a T1  magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (TR\u00a0=\u00a01.9 s; TE\u00a0=\u00a02.32\u00a0ms; FOV\u00a0=\u00a0230; matrix\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256; sagittal acquisition plane; slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a00.9\u00a0mm; 192 slices). MBW and EPI scans were collected with an oblique axial orientation to prevent signal drop-out in orbital and temporal regions, thereby maximizing coverage of the brain. \n\n\n### fMRI data preprocessing and analysis \n  \nStandard preprocessing was conducted using the FSL FMRIBs Software Library (FSL v6.0, Oxford, UK;  ). We corrected for head motion using MCFLIRT (Jenkinson,  ). Data were skull-stripped with BET (Smith,  ), spatially smoothed with a 6\u00a0mm full width half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel, and a high-pass temporal filtering with a 128\u00a0s cutoff was applied to remove low-frequency drift across time (Gaussian-weighted least squares straight line fitting; sigma\u00a0=\u00a064.0\u00a0s). Image co-registration was done using a three-step registration procedure (EPI to T2 to T1), and each functional image was resampled to 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0mm and warped to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute 2\u00a0mm brain using FLIRT (Jenkinson,  ;  ). Moreover, to remove artifact signals such as motion and physiological noise, we applied an independent component analysis (ICA) denoising procedure using MELODIC (Beckmann,  ), combined with an automated signal classification toolbox (an average of 4.02 components or 11.33% were removed; classifier NP-threshold\u00a0=\u00a00.3; for more details see Tohka   et al  .,  ). \n\nAfter preprocessing, statistical analyses were conducted on the individual subjects\u2019 data using the general linear model in the Statistical Parametric Mapping software package (SPM8; Welcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). Each trial was convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function. The YLG was modeled as an event-related design. In the fixed-effect model, we included two decision regressors (go and stop decisions); four outcome regressors [successful go (i.e. no car approaching), crash, necessary stop (i.e. car approaching), and unnecessary stop (i.e. no car approaching)]; as well as no-decisions, which were modeled in a separate regressor together with volumes that contained excessive motion (>2.0\u00a0mm framewise displacement; participants included had motion on < 10% of total slices). These regressors were estimated separately for each social context condition: Alone, Peer presence, and Parental presence. The time when participants were driving on the course between the intersections was not explicitly modeled and therefore served as an implicit baseline, which included the driving time across all runs, and controlled for basic visual characteristics. \n\nThe decision phase (go and stop decisions) was modeled with the onset of the yellow light and duration of their decision (i.e. when participants made a button press to either go or stop). The outcome phase for go decisions was modeled from either the onset of blue tilde (successful go) or onset of the crash (unsuccessful go), each with a 2.5\u00a0s duration, in order to make the outcome equitable across conditions. The outcome phase for stop decisions was modeled from the onset of the stopped car and had a duration of 2.5\u00a0s for both necessary and unnecessary stops. Note that we included the four possible outcomes in our model, but do not report on the outcome phase in the current paper, because we were specifically interested in the effects of parent and peer presence on decision-making (i.e. stop and go decisions). \n  \n(A) VS and TPJ activity when adolescents took risks (go-decision) in presence of peers compared to their parents. (B) dlPFC activity when adolescents made safe decisions (stop-decision) in presence of peers compared to their parents. For descriptive purposes, parameter estimates of intensity were extracted from Peer presence\u00a0>\u00a0baseline and Parent presence\u00a0>\u00a0baseline. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM). \n    \nBrain regions that showed positive activity for the main effects of   peer presence\u00a0>\u00a0parental presence  , separately for go and stop decisions at   P  \u00a0<\u00a00.005, FWE-cluster corrected \n    \nThe resulting contrast images, computed at the individual level, were submitted to random-effects group analyses. In the current study, our contrasts of interest were go and stop decisions, under peer   vs   parental presence (i.e. go decisions peer\u00a0>\u00a0parent, stop decisions peer\u00a0>\u00a0parent, as well as the reverse contrasts). At the group level, we conducted analyses on our contrasts of interest using GLMFlex, which removes outliers and sudden activation changes in the brain, partitions error terms, analyzes all voxels containing data and corrects for variance-covariance inequality ( ). In addition, we conducted psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses. Given the   a priori   hypotheses about the involvement of the VS (Chein   et al  .,  ; Telzer   et al  .,  ) in social context effects on decision-making, and the link between VS and cognitive control (Qu   et al  .,  ), insula (Guassi Moreira and Telzer,  ) and social brain (Peake   et al  .,  ) regions, the bilateral VS was specified as our seed region of interest (ROI). We structurally defined the VS using the WFUpickatlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer   et al  ., 2002; Maldjian   et al.  , 2003). \n\nThe generalized PPI toolbox in SPM involves a three-step approach to conduct PPI analyses (gPPI; McLaren   et al  .,  ). First, deconvolved time-series were extracted from the VS ROI for each participant to create the physiological variables; then each trial type was convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) to create the psychological regressor and finally the psychological regressors were multiplied with the physiological variable to create the PPI interaction terms. As such, the PPI interaction terms constitute regions that covary with the VS during the contrasts of interest. At the individual level, we included the deconvolved blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal as a regressor, together with the psychological and PPI interaction terms to create our gPPI model. Then, at the group level, we conducted random-effects, whole-brain analyses using GLMFlex to examine differences in functional connectivity across the Peer and Parent conditions, for stop and go decision separately. \n\nWe corrected all analyses for multiple comparisons using Monte Carlo simulations through 3DClustSim (updated version November 2016) in the software package AFNI (Ward,  ), and accounted for the smoothness of the data with the acf function within the 3dFWHMx command. For the main effects of decision, the simulation resulted in a voxel-wise threshold of   P  \u00a0<\u00a00.005 and minimum cluster size of 150 (stop) and 159 (go) voxels for the whole brain, which corresponds to   P  \u00a0<\u00a00.05, family-wise error (FWE) cluster-corrected. Given our   a priori   hypotheses of activation in the VS, an anatomically small structure which typically does not survive stringent correction, we applied a small volume correction for the VS, with a voxel-wise threshold of   P  \u00a0<\u00a00.005, and minimum cluster size of   k  \u00a0=\u00a020 (Giuliani and Pfeifer,  ; Guassi Moreira and Telzer,  ). For the PPI analyses, the simulation resulted in a voxel-wise threshold of   P  \u00a0<\u00a00.005 and minimum cluster size of 115 (stop) and 116 (go) voxels for the whole-brain. All reported results are available on NeuroVault (Gorgolewski   et al  .,  ; see  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral analyses \n  \nTo test the effects of parental and peer presence on risk-taking behavior, we compared the percentage of go decisions in the parent, peer and alone conditions. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated a significant effect of condition   F  (2,110\u00a0=\u00a05.312,   P  \u00a0=\u00a00.006). To probe this effect, we conducted a series of paired-samples   t  -tests. We found no significant differences in the percentage of go decisions between parent and peer [  t  (55)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.437,   P  \u00a0=\u00a00.663;   M  (  SD  ) \u00a0=\u00a047.66(12.04);   M  (  SD  ) \u00a0=\u00a048.23(11.09)]. Replicating our prior work (Telzer   et al  .,  ), adolescents were less risky in the presence of their parent compared to alone [  t  (55)\u00a0=\u00a02.529,   P  \u00a0=\u00a0.014;   M  (  SD  ) \u00a0=\u00a052.254(13.69)]. However, inconsistent with prior work (Chein   et al  .,  ) adolescents were   less   risky in the presence of their peer compared to alone (  t  (55)\u00a0= 2.774,   P  \u00a0=\u00a00.008). Note that percentage of stop decisions is the exact opposite of go decisions and so are not reported. Next, we compared reaction times (s) for go and stop decisions between parent, peer and alone conditions. Results indicated no significant differences between the conditions (go:   F  (2,110)\u00a0=\u00a00.937,   P  \u00a0=\u00a00.395; stop:   F  (2,110)\u00a0=\u00a02.057,   P  \u00a0=\u00a00.133). \n\n\n### fMRI analyses \n  \n Differences in neural activation during peer presence compared to parent presence.   We first examined the main effects for the peer\u00a0>\u00a0parent contrasts. For go decisions, we observed greater activity in the VS ( ), as well as regions involved in social cognition (precuneus, fusiform, left TPJ; for the latter, see  ), motor (supplementary motor area, postcentral gyrus) as well as visual processing (occipital cortex), and cerebellum when peers were present compared to when parents were present (see   for all regions). For descriptive purposes, we extracted parameter estimates of signal intensity from the VS and TPJ clusters, separately for peer go\u00a0>\u00a0baseline and parent go\u00a0>\u00a0baseline and plotted the activation ( ). \n\nWhen making stop-decisions in the presence of peers compared to parents, adolescents displayed greater activity in the dlPFC. For descriptive purposes, we extracted parameter estimates of signal intensity from the dlPFC cluster, separately for stop peer\u00a0>\u00a0baseline and stop parent\u00a0>\u00a0baseline and plotted the activation ( ). No regions were more active in the parent\u00a0>\u00a0peer contrasts for either go or stop decisions. \n\n Differences in neural connectivity during parent presence compared to peer presence.   Next, we conducted PPI analyses using the VS as the seed region, comparing neural coupling separately for go and stop decisions in the presence of parents compared to peers. For go decisions, we found a significant interaction between the VS and insula in the presence of their parent compared to their peer. To further examine this effect, we extracted parameter estimates of signal intensity from the insula cluster for each condition separately relative to baseline and plotted these effects. \n\nAs shown in  , adolescents displayed greater connectivity between the VS and insula when making go decisions in the presence of their parent compared to their peer. In addition, we found greater coupling between the VS and visual regions in the presence of parents   vs   peers ( ). \n  \n(A) VS-insula connectivity when adolescents took risks (go-decision) in presence of parents compared to their peers. (B) VS-TPJ connectivity when adolescents engaged in safe decision-making (stop-decision) in presence of parents compared to their peers. For descriptive purposes, parameter estimates of intensity were extracted from each condition compared to baseline. Error bars represent the SEM. \n    \nBrain regions that showed positive activity for the PPI analysis with VS as seed region and effects of   parental presence\u00a0>\u00a0peer presence  , separately for go and stop decisions at   P  \u00a0<\u00a00.005, FWE-cluster corrected \n    \nFor safe decisions (i.e. when adolescents chose to stop), the PPI results yielded a significant interaction between the VS and bilateral TPJ in the presence of their parent compared to their peer. To further examine this effect, we extracted parameter estimates of functional connectivity from the left TPJ cluster for each condition separately relative to baseline and plotted these effects. As shown in  , adolescents displayed greater connectivity between the VS and TPJ when making safe decisions in the presence of their parent compared to their peer. In addition, we found greater coupling between the VS and bilateral STS as well as precuneus in the presence of parents   vs   peers ( ). No regions were functionally connected to the VS in the peer\u00a0>\u00a0parent contrasts for either go or stop decisions. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study aimed to gain traction on the different roles of two key social influences on risk taking during adolescence: peers and parents. A sample of 12\u201315-year-old adolescents completed the YLG, a computerized risky driving task, while their performance was observed by their peers and parents, which for the first time allowed us to   directly   compare effects of peer and parental presence on risk taking within the same group of adolescents. Unexpectedly, behavioral findings revealed no effects of social context on risk taking. At the neural level, during risky decisions, adolescents displayed greater activity in the VS and TPJ with a peer present compared to their parent, as well as greater activity in the dlPFC during safe decisions when peers relative to parents were present. Analyses of functional coupling showed greater connectivity during parental presence compared to peer presence for both risky and safe decisions\u2014greater VS-insula coupling during risky decisions and greater VS-TPJ coupling during safe decisions. Together, these findings suggest that peer presence elicits greater activity of an interplay of affective, social and cognitive control regions, while parental presence elicits greater functional coupling between affective, social and cognitive control regions. \n\nMany decisions in adolescents\u2019 everyday lives take place in a social context, either with social others intimately involved or with their perspectives in mind. Empirical work shows the robust effects of social context on adolescent decision-making (Van Hoorn   et al  .,  ; Blakemore,  ). Yet, it is currently less well understood how different social sources may uniquely impact behavior and the underlying neural substrates which guide that behavior. Status and acceptance in the peer group become crucially important during adolescence, which may be one factor involved in the adolescents\u2019 pursuit of riskier behavior in the presence of peers (Prinstein and Wang,  ; Somerville,  ), especially with the popular notion (i.e. perceived social norm) that fellow teenagers show high levels of risk-taking (Van Hoorn   et al  .,  ; Powers   et al  .,  ). Alternatively, it has been suggested that adolescents conform to their peers to avoid social risks and maintain their acceptance in the peer group (Blakemore,  ), an effect corroborated by experimental fMRI research (Peake   et al  .,  ; Falk   et al  .,  ; Telzer   et al  .,  ). Across these explanations, processes of social learning and conformity to perceived social norms from the social context play a key role in the effects of peers (i.e. perceived endorsement of risk- taking, leading to greater risks), as well as parents (i.e. perceived endorsement of safe behavior, leading to fewer risks) (Telzer   et al  .,  ). \n\nDespite the wealth of studies showing separate peer and parent effects on risk-taking behaviors, the current study yielded no such effects at the behavioral level. While one could argue that a computerized driving task may be more appropriate for older adolescent samples (i.e. legal driving age\u00a0>\u00a016 in the USA and >\u00a018 in Europe), previous work has successfully found social influence effects using the Stoplight task in similar age ranges (Gardner and Steinberg,  : ages 13\u201316 years; Telzer   et al  .,  : ages 14\u00a0years). Moreover, the age range appears appropriate in light of recent work suggesting greater sensitivity to peers in early adolescence (Knoll   et al  .,  ; Van Hoorn   et al  .,  ), a time when parental scaffolding is also more prominent than in mid- or late adolescence (Scriber and Guyer,  ). The social context manipulations employed in the current study were based off of previous work (\u2018average peer\u2019 video from Peake   et al  .,  ; parent protocol from Telzer   et al  .,  , Guassi Moreira and Telzer,  ), and entailed an active observation of performance (Somerville  et al  .,  ). While we replicated behavioral effects comparing risk taking when alone compared to a parent present (Telzer   et al  .,  ), the effects for the peer condition are inconsistent with prior research (Chein   et al  .,  ). We speculate that the lower level of risk taking in the presence of the peer may be related to the video manipulation we used. When adolescents supposedly watched their peer play, they saw them taking about 50% risk. This video manipulation may have set the norm for task behavior, which may have resulted in a social conformity effect (i.e. incorporating the norm set by the peer into the adolescents\u2019 own behavior). Because we did not also have an observation of parent behavior, this social conformity may have only occurred for the peer condition. The absence of significant behavioral differences between parent and peers has interesting implications for future research, suggesting that peer and parent effects may be dependent on the modes through which social influence occur. Showing a video of a peer\u2019s behavior may have different consequences for risk-taking behavior than having peers just present. In conjunction with our neural findings, which do show differences between the two social contexts, we speculate that the same behavior is a result of different processes, which, when taking place in the real world, may affect decision-making in the ways we expect\u2014greater risk taking with peers and more safe decisions with parents. \n\nAt the neural level, risky decisions in the presence of peers relative to parents elicited greater activity in the VS, a region previously associated with processing of reward motivation and salience (Delgado,  ; Telzer,  ; Schreuders   et al  .,  ). Previous work shows that when adolescents take risks, the VS response is amplified in the presence of peers relative to alone as well as following social rejection, suggesting an important role in perceived social status and expected value of risk behaviors in a peer context (Chein   et al  .,  ; Peake   et al  .,  ; Telzer   et al  .,  ). Our findings provide additional evidence for the hypothesis that risk-taking in the presence of peers is potentially related to greater reward motivation, an effect not found in the presence of parents. \n\nIn addition to the VS, we found increased activation in the fusiform, TPJ and precuneus, regions implicated in detection and processing of social cues (Nelson   et al  .,  ; Blakemore,  ), with greater recruitment of these regions in the presence of peers relative to parents. The fusiform is part of the social-detection node (Nelson   et al  .,  ) and has a role in processing salient affective components of the social environment, particularly in appetitive social contexts (Perino   et al  .,  ). The TPJ is a key component of the so-called social brain, generally involved in perspective-taking and (social) attention processes (Mitchell   et al  .,  ; Van den Bos   et al  .,  ), and has been linked to greater risk-taking after social exclusion (Peake   et al  .,  ). Interestingly, in a neutral setting (i.e. art work attitudes), parent and peer influences rely on the same neural bases, including social brain regions such as the TPJ (Welborn   et al  .,  ), while our findings highlight that an interplay of affective and social brain regions are more active when taking risks with a peer present relative to a parent. This suggests that risky decisions may be processed as more socially salient events with the psychological presence of a peer (Shah,  ), and perhaps this increased allocation of neural resources is related to a greater need for social reward and connection in the peer domain, relative to parents who are more likely to endorse (i.e. provide social reward for) safe behaviors. \n\nDuring safe decisions, adolescents recruited the dlPFC to a greater extent in the presence of a peer than their parent. The dlPFC is a neural region commonly found in the context of safe decision-making (Peake   et al  .,  ), and is often associated with general cognitive control, as well as more specific suppression of affective responses (Aron   et al  .,  ; Ridderinkhof   et al  .,  ). The presence of peers may make a risky decision more attractive and salient, and as such, adolescents likely need to recruit more cognitive control resources to make a safe decision in front of their peers than in front of parents, in order to compute the same safe behavior. \n\nFunctional coupling between the VS and prefrontal and social regions also affects adolescent risk-taking (Guassi Moreira and Telzer,  ; Peake   et al  .,  ; Qu   et al  .,  ). Adolescents displayed increased VS-insula coupling when they made a risky decision in the parent condition relative to the peer condition. The insula is generally seen as neural hub integrating affective and cognitive cues, and helps guide attention during goal-directed behavior (Menon and Uddin,  ; Touroutoglou   et al  .,  ; Smith   et al  .,  ,  ). Hence, it is not surprising that the insula is consistently implicated in adolescent decision-making in social contexts (Van Hoorn   et al  .,  ). Increased functional connectivity between the VS and insula has been linked to attenuated risk-taking (Van Duijvenvoorde   et al  .,  ), as well as increased risk taking in high-conflict relationships with parents (Guassi Moreira and Telzer,  ). Linking this finding to the main effect, which showed a relatively low VS response when adolescents took risks while their parent was observing, we speculate when the insula comes online in conjunction with the VS, this potentially downregulates VS activation with parental presence. The insula may function as a relay center that indicates the level of activity of the VS to prefrontal cognitive control regions (Guassi Moreira and Telzer,  ). Note that analyses of functional connectivity assess correlations, so future work is needed to detect the direction of this relationship, for example using techniques such as Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME) (Gates and Molenaar,  ). \n\nFinally, parent relative to peer presence elicited heightened VS-TPJ coupling during safe decisions, suggesting that within adolescents, those who engage the VS to a greater extent also engage the TPJ more. These results highlight the importance of examining crosstalk between regions implicated in reward and social cognition when examining social influence. Interestingly, Peake   et al  . ( ) report exploratory analyses of increased TPJ-VS coupling during risky decisions after social exclusion that did not reach the threshold of significance. Our findings build on this work, and suggest that adolescents engage in mentalizing to make safe decisions, and that this may elicit a reward response in the context of parental presence. As such, functional coupling between the VS and social regions such as the TPJ may result in adaptive or maladaptive outcomes depending on the context (Pfeifer   et al  .,  ; Telzer   et al  .,  ). \n\nWhile the current study provides important insights into two salient sources of influence, the influence of each source may change with development (Scriber and Guyer,  ). We used a relatively large sample of early adolescents, but did not include other age groups to test whether these effects are   unique   to adolescence. Potentially, as compared to adolescence, parental influences may be more potent than peer influences in childhood, and perhaps both sources decrease in saliency when individuals enter adulthood (Knoll   et al  .,  ). Future research should focus on gaining more traction on   why   and   how   questions of social influences and determining the boundaries between which social influences occur (Somerville   et al  .,  ), for example comparing active (i.e. through feedback) and passive (i.e. observing performance) influences across different contexts and behaviors. In daily life, adolescents may also have to deal with the simultaneous (and potentially conflicting) influences from parents and peers, which no study today has addressed. Moreover, relationship quality with peers and parents, including aspects of conflict and support likely modulates these effects (Guassi Moreira and Telzer,  ). Studying relationship quality will be an important direction for future research, and should include the comparison of an actual friend and parent, in order to account for potential effects of similarity and closeness. \n\nIn conclusion, we employed a sample of early adolescents and, for the first time, disentangled   within-person   neural mechanisms that differentiate risky and safe decision-making in peer and parent contexts. An interplay of affective, social and cognitive regions (VS, TPJ, dlPFC) was more activated during decision-making with peers. On the other hand, findings showed more crosstalk between affective and social regions (VS-insula, VS-TPJ) during decision-making with parents. Our results highlight the salient nature of peers during adolescence, and at the same time show the complex nature of social influence processes in peer and parent contexts, emphasizing the utility of combining analytic techniques assessing mean levels of activity and neural coupling. These findings contribute to an increased understanding of the opportunities and vulnerabilities associated with adolescent sensitivity to potent social contexts, and ultimately may provide ways to mitigate the increase in risk-taking and help adolescents navigate this phase of life safely and successfully. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6137311, "text_md5": "7cb49e2b9b6853dfb4f31b453c86b409", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 105], "journal": [106, 130], "publication_year": [132, 136], "title": [147, 246], "keywords": [260, 333], "abstract": [346, 1948], "body": [1957, 44204]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 30137631, "doi": "10.1093/scan/nsy071", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6137311", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6137311"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6137311\">6137311</a>", "list_title": "PMC6137311  Differential effects of parent and peer presence on neural correlates of risk taking in adolescence"}

In this study, we investigated behavioural and functional magnetic resonance imaging correlates of trait self-boundarylessness during resting state and the performance of two experimental tasks. We found that boundarylessness correlated with greater self-endorsement of words related to fluidity and with longer response times in a math task. Boundarylessness also correlated negatively with brain activity in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus during mind-wandering compared to a task targeting a minimal sense of self. Interestingly, boundarylessness showed quadratic relations to several measures. Participants reporting low or high boundarylessness, as compared to those in between, showed higher functional connectivity within the default mode network during rest, less brain activity in the medial prefrontal cortex during self-referential word processing, and less self-endorsement of words related to constancy. We relate these results to our previous findings of a quadratic relation between boundarylessness and the sense of perspectival ownership of experience. Additionally, an instruction to direct attention to the centre of experience elicited brain activation similar to that of meditation onset, including increases in anterior precentral gyrus and anterior insula and decreases in default mode network areas, for both non-meditators and experienced meditators. \n \n\n# Body\n    \nTrait self-boundarylessness showed a U-shaped relation to resting-state default mode network connectivity. \n  \nTrait self-boundarylessness showed an inverse U-shaped relation to medial prefrontal cortex activity during self-referential processing. \n  \nTrait self-boundarylessness correlated with endorsing more words relating to fluidity as self-descriptive and with longer response times in a math task. \n  \nAn instruction to direct attention to the centre of experience elicited a brain activation pattern similar to that of meditation onset. \n   \n## Introduction \n  \nThe complex construct of the self has been usefully divided into two aspects: the narrative and minimal self ( ), following  . The narrative self refers to a conceptual understanding of ourselves as temporally extended persons, while the minimal self has to do with a momentary sense of being separable from the surroundings. The most minimal kind of self is arguably the sense of perspectival ownership of experience ( ), a first-person perspective that amounts to nothing more than the sense that experiences are presented to, or experienced by, a kind of centre, observer, or witness. \n\nA central aspect of the experience of self refers to a sense of separateness, duality, or boundedness in relation to the world. This can appear in different ways, pertaining to, e.g., life history and identity, the spatial location of the self in relation to the surroundings, the extent of one\u2019s possibility to influence the course of events through agency, or the division between \u2018mine\u2019 and \u2018not mine\u2019 applied to physical or mental phenomena ( ). This ordinary sense of being a bounded self can be altered through meditation, and such changes may occur not only during the meditative practice itself but also gradually become part of the practitioner\u2019s everyday life\u2014a trait-level alteration ( ,  ). The purpose of our study was to investigate brain correlates of trait-level sense of self-boundaries in participants with varying meditation experience during rest, a narrative self task, and a minimal self task focused on the sense of perspectival ownership of experience. \n\nPrevious brain imaging studies suggest that a decreased sense of self relates to decreased activity of the default mode network (DMN; e.g.  ) and increased connectivity between DMN and the fronto-parietal network (FPN, e.g.  ). Decreased activity in the main DMN hubs posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and inferior parietal lobes/temporo-parietal junction (IPLs/TPJ) is a common finding across various studies on meditation ( ,  ) and also been found in studies of transient states of self-transcendence induced by hypnosis and psychedelic drugs (e.g.  ,  ,  ,  ; see  , for a review). Although not specifically targeting selflessness, several studies on meditators during rest have reported trait-level increases in within-network connectivity of the DMN and FPN and increased between-network connectivity for the DMN, FPN, and the salience network (SLN; e.g.  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). However, findings on resting-state alterations in meditators diverge ( ), and it is important to consider the detailed phenomenology of the targeted states. For example, in focused attention meditation, self-related processing is actively suppressed and thus decreased DMN activity is an expected finding, while in open monitoring meditation the goal is not to suppress but to attend to the free movement of the mind, which may or may not include DMN activity ( ). Along these lines,   found higher activity in the PCC during nondirective meditation compared to rest. Increased DMN connectivity has been linked to an increased sense of wakefulness during meditation and decreased anticorrelation between networks to attention systems being active also at rest ( ). \n\nIn an illuminating magnetoencephalography study,   investigated the neural correlates and phenomenology of narrative and minimal self and of selfless experience. This study reported that narrative self corresponded to gamma activity in the medial and (predominantly left) lateral frontal areas and thalamus and minimal self to beta activity in partly overlapping areas including the left ventral mPFC and thalamus and right premotor cortex and in the (predominantly right) IPL, PCC, precuneus, and insula. When meditators entered the selfless mode from the minimal mode, activity in the areas implicated in minimal self decreased. The level of decrease in the right IPL and left dorsomedial thalamus correlated with reports of lack of sense of ownership in the selfless state. In a follow-up case study,   targeted the sense of boundarylessness in selfless experience, an experience described as lacking both ownership and centredness. The study found pronounced decreases in beta activity during experiences of boundarylessness in two major areas: the bilateral TPJ and medial parietal cortex. In addition, beta decreases were seen in the primary sensory and motor regions, insula, and right supplementary motor area (SMA). Likewise,   found that a decrease in electroencephalography (EEG) synchrony in bilateral posterior DMN areas correlated with an experience of expanding self-boundaries. Similar results come from a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study by  , who found activity in the mPFC in narrative self-processing and decreases in this area in minimal self, defined as present-moment experiencing. In addition, minimal self was associated with increased activity in the right prefrontal cortex, insula, secondary somatosensory cortex, and IPL. \n\nThe aforementioned studies thus point to an involvement of anterior and left-lateralized areas of the DMN (mPFC) in narrative self and an involvement of posterior and right-lateralized areas of the DMN (PCC/precuneus and IPL) in minimal self. However, other studies point to a more distributed set of brain regions involved in both these aspects of self. A recent meta-analysis of 125 studies on neural correlates of mental self-processing identified both anterior and posterior parts of DMN (mPFC, PCC, and TPJ) and several other areas (ACC, anterior insula, left thalamus, superior frontal gyrus, and right premotor cortex) as involved in the narrative self ( ). An automated meta-analysis by   likewise found all the major hubs of the DMN (mPFC, PCC, and TPJ) and the ACC, frontal and temporal poles, and perirhinal cortex to be activated in verbal self-referential processing (SRP). In a study targeting minimal self,   reported a decrease in functional connectivity, measured by EEG, in the mPFC in experienced meditators who were instructed to downregulate the sense of first-person perspective. Likewise in two previous studies ( ,  ), mPFC synchronicity increased with meditation training. The authors relate this increase to the sense of being a witnessing observer. \n\nDespite these discrepancies, we conclude that the findings for both trait and state selflessness, pertaining to narrative and minimal self, relate strongly to alterations of DMN activity, mostly in a negative direction. Indeed, converging findings suggest that the DMN midline regions account for self-specificity at several levels, both explicit and implicit ( ). The fact that the DMN is also the brain\u2019s default state, being active in the absence of tasks, can be seen as an indication that the self relates to a central and basal function of the brain ( ). However, this is not universally consistent; in addition to the alterations seen as an effect of meditation, a recent cross-cultural investigation suggests that DMN connectivity and activity correlate negatively to collective and holistic thinking ( ). \n\n### The present study \n  \nTo target the neural correlates of trait self-boundarylessness both in rest and in relation to narrative and minimal self, we collected functional brain data in three contexts: a resting state, a standard SRP task using trait adjectives, and a novel \u2018checking-in\u2019 task intended to strengthen the sense of perspectival ownership of experience by asking participants to focus on their centre of experience and the sense of being an observer. \n\nThe fMRI data were correlated to a self-report measure of boundarylessness. As our previous qualitative analysis of interview data revealed a quadratic relation between this measure and descriptions of perspectival ownership of experience ( ), we tested both linear and quadratic relations between boundarylessness and brain data and behavioural data using polynomial linear regression. \n\nFor the resting state, we expected DMN connectivity to correlate with boundarylessness. For the two experimental tasks, we hypothesized that the fMRI blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal activity in the main DMN hubs would correlate with boundarylessness. Thus, we selected the PCC/precuneus, mPFC, and left and right IPL as our a priori regions of interest (ROIs). Because of the role of the thalamus and insula in interoception, we also hypothesized that activity in these regions would correlate positively with boundarylessness in the checking-in task targeting minimal self. We further predicted that boundarylessness would correlate with a more positive and less static self-image, so that more positively valenced trait adjectives and adjectives relating to fluidity, but less negatively valenced words and words relating to constancy, would be endorsed as self-descriptive by more boundaryless participants. \n\nThe study was preregistered before fMRI data collection, however some interview and questionnaire data was collected before preregistration. (A further prediction mentioned in the preregistration was that SRP would have less emotional charge for more boundaryless participants, so that there would be a negative correlation between boundarylessness and response times and activity in the amygdala. However, this analysis could not be performed as the amygdala was lost due to an arrow field of view (see  ). In addition, we aimed to control for heart rate and breathing, but due to technical issues we were unable to obtain these measures for a majority of participants, meaning they could not be controlled for.) \n\n\n\n## Material and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were recruited through the Lund University Department of Psychology website and an alumni network. We asked for both meditators and non-meditators interested in participating in a brain imaging study on self-consciousness and meditation. All participants signed an informed consent form and stated that they were not currently suffering from or under treatment for any severe mental illness, including depression, dissociation, or psychotic disorders. Participants were interviewed about their everyday self-experience, with a special focus on the sense of boundaries and perspectival ownership of experience. After the interviews they were asked about handedness and MR contraindications (claustrophobia and metal implants), and to estimate their meditation experience in terms of number of years, number of hours per week, and lifetime number of days on retreat, and then they completed a number of self-report scales, only one of which is used in the present study. Participation was compensated with cinema tickets or, if preferred, an equivalent monetary reimbursement. The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority, #2020-00525. \n\n\n### Boundarylessness measure \n  \nBased on the results of interviews and questionnaires, reported elsewhere ( ), we arrived at a self-rated measure of boundarylessness, which was used in this paper. This measure is an inversion of the Perceived Body Boundaries Scale ( ), a graphic, ungraded visual analogue scale with the end points \u2018My body boundaries are almost imperceptible\u2019 and \u2018My body boundaries are extremely salient\u2019. The marks made by participants on a 10-cm line were measured in millimetres, rendering an interval of 0\u2013100, inverted so that 0 indicates the maximal sense of boundaries and 100 indicates the maximal boundarylessness. This rating was chosen as it showed excellent agreement with quantitative judgements of trait selflessness based on the phenomenological interviews made by two coders independently (Spearman\u2019s   r  \u2009=\u20090.92 and 0.78, respectively), but with greater variance and reproducibility. \n\n\n### MRI tasks and procedure \n  \nParticipants were screened for MR safety and informed about what to expect during MR scanning. They were fitted with hearing protection, a four-button keypad in their right hand to respond to tasks, and an emergency contact button in their left hand. \n\nData were acquired on an actively shielded 7\u2009T Philips MR scanner (Achieva; Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands) with a two-channel transmit, 32-channel receive head coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA, USA), and two dielectric pads (Multiwave Imaging, Marseille, France). The MR acquisition consisted of a high-resolution, T1-weighted anatomical image (voxel size 1\u00d71\u2009\u00d7\u20091 mm , echo time \u20091.97\u2009ms, repetition time 5\u2009ms, acquisition time 1.43\u2009min, flip angle\u2009=\u20096 degrees, field of view\u2009=\u2009199\u2009\u00d7\u2009251\u2009\u00d7\u2009200\u2009mm ). Three functional runs, one for resting state and one for each of two tasks, were obtained using a gradient echo planar image acquisition sequence with interleaved, oblique (orbitomeatal) axial slices with 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009mm  voxels and a 0.2-mm slice gap. Before each functional run, a field map was acquired to correct for inhomogeneities in the magnetic field, and five dummy scans were obtained to allow the MR signal to reach a steady state before data collection. \n\nThe first functional run was a resting-state scan lasting 10.43\u2009minutes (350 TRs of 1.8 s each). Participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed and rest but not fall asleep and to not deliberately meditate. The field of view was 224\u2009\u00d7\u2009232\u2009\u00d7\u2009149\u2009mm  comprising 68 slices. \n\nThe second functional run was a SRP task, administered through E-prime (Psychological Software Tools). During this task, adapted from  , participants were administered a set of trait adjectives from the Affective Norms of Emotion Words database ( ). The original 20 positive and 20 negative trait adjectives were translated to Swedish by the first author, slightly modified to make the words more relevant in Swedish, and divided into blocks of five words each, which were either all positive or all negative. To each block, one \u2018fluid\u2019 word and one \u2018constant\u2019 word judged to be of the same valence as the rest of the block were added (total 16 words relating to fluidity/solidity). Examples of such words were \u2018best\u00e4ndig\u2019 (durable; positive-constant), \u2018dynamisk\u2019 (dynamic; positive-fluid), \u2018statisk\u2019 (static; negative-constant), and \u2018flyktig\u2019 (volatile; negative-fluid). Half of the words, evenly distributed across positive and negative, were presented in uppercase, and the other half in lowercase letters. Each word was presented for 3 s, resulting in a total of 21\u2009s per seven-word block. A fixation cross was presented for 4 s between each block. The blocks were presented three times, once in conjunction with each of three questions: \u2018describes me?\u2019 (Self condition), \u2018is positive?\u2019 (Valence condition), and \u2018is uppercase?\u2019 (Case condition). While Self was the condition of primary interest, Valence was included as a close control condition, and Case as a disparate control condition. Block order was the same across participants and was pseudo-randomized, so that no block type was presented two times in a row. The duration of this run was 10.48\u2009minutes (540 TRs of 1.2 s each), and the field of view was 224\u2009\u00d7\u2009232\u2009\u00d7\u200997 mm , comprising 44 dynamic slices. \n\nThe third functional run was designed to target the sense of perspectival ownership of experience (hereafter checking-in). This task was also presented through E-prime and consisted of simple math questions interspersed with presentations of shapes (circle, square, triangle, or arrow). Participants were instructed beforehand to \u2018focus on the centre of your experience, the \u201cexperiencer\u201d or \u201cobserver\u201d\u2019 whenever the arrow was presented. Again, while Arrow was the condition of interest, Symbol was a close control condition, and Math a disparate control condition. The duration of math blocks (three questions per block) and arrow blocks were fixed to 12\u2009s, whereas the duration of the other symbols was jittered (randomized between two and eight TRs), so that the average was 12\u2009s per block of two symbols. The order of the three conditions (Math, Arrow, and Symbol) was the same for all participants and was pseudo-randomized, so that no block type was presented more than twice in a row. The duration of this run was 12\u2009minutes (600 TRs of 1.2 s each), and the field of view was 224\u2009\u00d7\u2009232\u2009\u00d7\u200997 mm , comprising 44 dynamic slices. \n\nAll participants were familiarized with the two experimental tasks before scanning by means of a short demo version on a computer. After scanning, a brief recorded interview was conducted to assess the participants\u2019 experiences during the resting state and each of the two tasks. \n\n\n### MRI preprocessing and analysis \n  \nMR data were processed and analysed using SPM12 ( ) and the CONN toolbox for SPM, version 20.b ( ), in MATLAB, version R2021a (MathWorks Inc.). Further statistical analyses were done with jamovi 2.2 [ ], using the GAMLj module for regression models ( ), and data visualization was done using MRIcroGL 1.2 ( ). Preprocessing (preregistered) consisted of realignment to the first slice, unwarping and susceptibility distortion correction using voxel-displacement maps, slice-timing correction to the middle slice, outlier volume scrubbing using ART as implemented in CONN, with 95 percentiles in normative sample for the resting state, and a threshold of <0.9 mm movement and   z  \u2009<\u20095 global signal for the tasks, segmentation and normalization to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space for functional and structural images separately, and smoothing with a 6-mm Gaussian kernel. The voxel size of 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092 mm  was not resampled during preprocessing. \n\nFor the resting state, mean connectivity was computed as means of the correlations of time series for each participant between each pair of DMN hubs, as defined by CONN (see  ). These measures were then entered into polynomial regression models to check for linear and quadratic relationships to boundarylessness, employing a significance threshold of   P  \u2009<\u2009.05. We also performed a seed-based connectivity analysis using each of our a priori ROIs as seeds, with a peak-level threshold of   P   < .001 and a cluster-level threshold of   P  \u2009<\u2009.05, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected. \n\nFor the two tasks, SRP and checking-in, contrasts between the condition of interest and each of the two control conditions were calculated using SPM, first for each participant (first level) and then for all participants (second level). Six movement parameters and variables for scrubbing outlier volumes were added as covariates at the first level. Data were first analysed at the group level using contrasts between the condition of interest and the closest control condition for each task (Self vs. Valence for SRP and Arrow vs. Symbol for checking-in). To look for correlations between boundarylessness and brain activity during the condition of interest, as part of our preregistered plan, we extracted mean beta values for each participant from these contrasts in our a priori ROIs, as defined by the Neuromorphometrics atlas in SPM ( ; see  ). The analysis was thresholded at   P  \u2009<\u2009.001 uncorrected at the peak level and   P   < .05 FDR corrected at the cluster level. Due to the exploratory nature of the checking-in task, we decided to also look for correlations to activity in all clusters that were significant at the group level, using the same threshold. This analysis was not part of the preregistered plan but was justified by the novelty of this task. Finally, an exploratory (preregistered) whole-brain analysis was performed looking for clusters where activity significantly correlated with boundarylessness in the condition of interest compared to the two control conditions, using a grey matter mask and a significance threshold of   P   < .05 FDR corrected at the cluster level and a cluster size threshold of   k   > 10 (80 mm ). In all cases we evaluated linear and quadratic relations. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe recruited and interviewed 32 participants (  and  ). Four of these were not included in MR analyses: two cancelled beforehand due to illness, another cancelled at the beginning of the scanning due to ear pain while in the scanner, and one had to be excluded because of brain pathology. Two resting-state runs had to be discarded, one due to technical problems and one due to the participant keeping their eyes open. For two participants, neither of the task runs could be performed due to discomfort in the scanner. In addition, one checking-in run had to be discarded due to technical problems and another due to post-scanning interviews revealing that the participant had misunderstood the task. Thus, the final sample consisted of 26 scans for resting state and SRP, and 24 scans for checking-in, with some variation in the participant groups for each run. The distribution of self-rated boundarylessness of these three groups is displayed in  . Boundarylessness correlated with meditation experience, measured both in years (Pearson\u2019s   r  \u2009=\u20090.46,   P  \u2009=\u2009.01), hours per week (  r  \u2009=\u20090.46,   P  \u2009=\u2009.01), estimated total hours (  r\u2009  =\u20090.58,   P  \u2009=\u2009.001), and the number of days on retreat (  r  \u2009=\u20090.39,   P  \u2009=\u2009.04), but not with age (  r  \u2009=\u20090.07,   P  \u2009=\u2009.71). \n  \nDistributions of (a) age, (b) meditation experience in years, (c) estimated total hours of meditation, and (d) self-rated boundarylessness for the total sample of 28 participants (further details in  ) \n  \nTwo of the participants were left-handed. As neither of the tasks were language-dependent and our ROIs are bilateral, we did not expect handedness to influence the results. The main analyses were run with and without these two participants, which confirmed that there were no alterations other than a slight loss of power. \n\n\n### Resting state \n  \nPolynomial regression analysis revealed a significant quadratic relation between boundarylessness and DMN connectivity such that lower and higher levels of boundarylessness were related to greater connectivity (  \u03b2  \u2009=\u20090.87,   P  \u2009<\u2009.001;  ). A post-hoc analysis of within- and between connectivity of the FPN and SLN yielded no significant results, but a trend for a quadratic relation with SLN connectivity (  \u03b2   = .50,   P   = .08;  ). All model parameters for these analyses are presented in  . \n  \nQuadratic relation between boundarylessness and DMN connectivity, with smoothed regression line (see also   and  ) \n  \nLooking at the connectivity between each pair of DMN hubs separately, the quadratic relation with boundarylessness held separately for the mPFC\u2013right IPL (  \u03b2   = 0.93,   P  \u2009<\u2009.001) and mPFC\u2013PCC (  \u03b2   = 0.67,   P  \u2009=\u2009.016), but not for the other four pairs (for details, see  ). However, whole-brain seed-based analysis at a stricter significance threshold revealed quadratic relations between the right IPL and a cluster in left angular gyrus/intraparietal sulcus and another cluster in the PCC/precuneus (  and  ). \n  \nResults from quadratic seed-based analysis of resting-state data. \n      \nResults from seed-based analysis of resting-state data on the MNI template.

Cluster details are in\u00a0 \n  \nThere were no linear correlations between boundarylessness and functional connectivity between our a priori ROIs.

Cluster details are in\u00a0 \n  \n\n### Tasks \n  \nBecause the field of view was narrow in the inferior to superior dimension for some of our participants, we could not analyse parts of superior parietal, temporal, and fronto-polar areas at the group level for either of the two task runs (see  ). This loss unfortunately included our a priori ROI the mPFC. To address this limitation, we redefined the mPFC ROI as a sphere with 20-mm radius around the peak coordinates (\u22126, 48, 0) for the mPFC/ACC cluster derived in the meta-analysis by  ; see  ). \n\n\n### SRP behavioural responses \n  \nWe examined the correlations between boundarylessness and self-endorsement of the (partly overlapping) word categories positive, negative, fluid, and constant ( ). With the removal of one participant who did not answer any of the self-questions, there was a positive linear correlation between boundarylessness and endorsing fluidity words (  r  \u2009=\u200956,   P  \u2009=\u2009.003,  ). This relation held for both the positively and negatively valenced words separately (positive:   r  \u2009=\u20090.39,   P  \u2009=\u2009.048; negative:   r  \u2009=\u20090.56,   P   = .003). In addition, there was an inverted U-shaped relation between boundarylessness and endorsing constancy words (  \u03b2  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.60,   P  \u2009=\u2009.013,  ), which held for the positive but not the negatively valenced words (positive:   \u03b2  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.55,   P   = .021; negative:   \u03b2  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.34,   P   = .172). There were no significant correlations between boundarylessness and the total number of positive and negative words endorsed as self-descriptive or between boundarylessness and response times (all   \u03b2  s and   r  s < |.34|, all   P  s\u2009>\u2009.09).\n \n  \nCorrelations between self-rated boundarylessness and number of words relating to fluidity or constancy endorsed as descriptive of oneself. (a) Fluidity words, total\u2009=\u20098. (b) Constancy words, total\u2009=\u20098 \n  \n\n### SRP fMRI group results \n  \nA whole-group analysis (  n  \u2009=\u200926) yielded three large clusters of increased BOLD responses for Self\u2009>\u2009Valence, in the PCC/precuneus, mPFC/superior frontal gyrus, and left angular gyrus. There were also three clusters of greater BOLD response for Valence\u2009>\u2009Self, across left and right intraparietal sulcus, lateral occipital cortex, and inferior temporal gyrus. All significant clusters are presented in\u00a0  and\u00a0 . \n  \nGroup-level activations and deactivations for Self compared to Valence. \n      \nGroup-level activations for Self\u2009>\u2009Valence (red) and Valence\u2009>\u2009Self (blue) in the SRP task on the MNI template.

Cluster descriptions are in\u00a0 \n  \n\n### SRP correlations with boundarylessness \n  \nThere was a significant inverted U-shaped relation between activity in Self\u2009>\u2009Valence and boundarylessness in our mPFC ROI (  \u03b2  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.67,   P  \u2009=\u2009.008). This was also reflected in the explorative whole-brain analysis of this contrast, which revealed a cluster in the mPFC that was correlated quadratically with boundarylessness (  \u03b2  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.93,   P  \u2009<\u2009.001;  ). There was no significant whole-brain correlations with boundarylessness in the contrast Self\u2009>\u2009Case. \n  \nClusters in the mPFC derived from whole-brain explorative correlation with boundarylessness for the group contrast Self\u2009>\u2009Valence in the SRP task: (a) imposed on MNI template and (b) mean beta values with smoothed regression line.   T  \u2009=\u20095.37, size 1512 mm , peak coordinates   x  \u2009=\u2009\u22128,   y  \u2009=\u200958, and   z  \u2009=\u200912; cluster level   P  \u2009=\u2009.009, FDR corrected. Numbers denote axial slices \n  \n\n### Checking-in behavioural responses \n  \nThere was a positive linear correlation between boundarylessness and response times for the math questions (  r  \u2009=\u20090.46,   P  \u2009=\u2009.017). Correlations were not significant between boundarylessness and correct answers or the number of answers (both   r   < |.14|,   P  \u2009>\u2009.49). \n\n\n### Phenomenology of focusing on the centre of experience \n  \nPost-scanning interviews revealed that most participants, 21 out of 24, experienced a clear difference between the checking-in prompting arrow and the neutral symbols, however in different ways: while some saw it as mentally taxing, others felt it to be relaxing; some felt it to be centring, others described it rather as expanding. When practising the task during the interviews, participants likewise reported very different responses to the instruction, but there was a pattern in that participants who rated low in both boundarylessness and perspectival ownership tended to respond in everyday terms, such as \u2018focusing on the stomach\u2019, while participants rated intermediate in boundarylessness and high in perspectival ownership described it as like stepping back into a restful peace, and participants rated high in boundarylessness and low in perspectival ownership described the task as hard, as looking for something which could not be found. See\u00a0  for example quotes. \n  \nReactions to the checking-in task instruction to focus on the centre of experience, the \u2018experiencer\u2019 or \u2018observer\u2019. \n  \n\n### Checking-in fMRI group results \n  \nWhole-group analysis (  n\u2009  =\u200924) for Arrow vs. Symbol showed significantly increased BOLD signal responses in a large cluster stretching over the bilateral anterior precentral gyrus [Brodmann area 6 [BA6]), including the premotor cortex, SMA, pre-SMA, and frontal eye fields, and stretching into the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. There was also increased activation in the left and right anterior insula and operculum, left supramarginal gyrus, left frontal pole, bilateral occipital cortex including a part of the left precuneus, and bilateral caudate nucleus/putamen including a part of left thalamus. There was significantly decreased activation in the bilateral PCC/precuneus and ACC/mPFC, right angular gyrus, right posterior insula, right middle temporal gyrus, and right frontal pole for Arrow vs. Symbol. All significant clusters are presented in\u00a0  and  .\n \n  \nGroup-level activations for Arrow compared to Symbol. \n      \nGroup-level activations for Arrow\u2009>\u2009Symbol (red) and Symbol\u2009>\u2009Arrow (blue), thresholded at   P  \u2009<\u2009.001 at peak level, uncorrected, and   P  \u2009<\u2009.05 at cluster level, FDR corrected, on the MNI template. Numbers denote axial slices. Cluster descriptions are in\u00a0 \n  \n\n### Checking-in correlations with boundarylessness \n  \nActivity in our a priori ROIs did not correlate significantly with boundarylessness for this task. Looking at correlations with the group-level clusters, we found that deactivation in the PCC/precuneus cluster correlated negatively with boundarylessness (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.41,   P  \u2009=\u2009.04;  ). Exploratory whole-brain correlations with boundarylessness on the contrasts Arrow vs. Symbol and Arrow vs. Math yielded no results at the chosen significance threshold. \n  \nCorrelation between boundarylessness and cluster mean beta values of the group-level cluster in the PCC/precuneus from the contrast Symbol\u2009>\u2009Arrow, displayed in\u00a0  and  \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### The quadratic relations to boundarylessness \n  \nRather than a simple linear relation between boundarylessness and DMN connectivity, we found a U-shaped relation to DMN within-network connectivity, so that participants rating low and high on this scale showed higher DMN connectivity, while participants in the middle-range had lower within-DMN connectivity. In addition to being strongly connected to self-specificity at several levels ( ), DMN activity has often been related to unhappiness stemming from rumination and mind-wandering and an inability to stay focused on a task or in the present moment ( ). Thus, it might seem counterintuitive that increased DMN connectivity would relate to an increased sense of self-boundarylessness, as trait self-transcendence is strongly connected to well-being ( ,  ). However, mind-wandering or day-dreaming can also be a rich source of pleasure and creativity ( ,  ,  ), and a free-flowing mind can be a source of self-insight if we are present to and accepting of it ( ). Perhaps persons in the high end of boundarylessness can reap the benefits of DMN activity without its disadvantages. If, as our data suggest, the path to boundarylessness is curved, it might be that one has to leave a dysfunctional pattern of mind-wandering before returning to a more wholesome one. The idea of a curved path to enlightenment is reflected in some meditation traditions, such as in this quote attributed to Zen master D\u014dgen: \n \nBefore one studies Zen, mountains are mountains and waters are waters; after a first glimpse into the truth of Zen, mountains are no longer mountains and waters are no longer waters; after enlightenment, mountains are once again mountains and waters once again waters. \n \nIn research on brain plasticity, nonlinear patterns of brain activation and grey matter volume changes as an effect of practice are well known (e.g.  ,  ). When we learn something new, the brain needs to engage more neurons and build new synapses, but such expansion cannot go on indefinitely. Thus, with time, synaptic pruning takes place and neuronal activation stabilizes in patterns that can afford the acquired skill in a more economic fashion. Something similar might be at play here, so that, e.g., the self-specifying aspect of the DMN gets \u2018pruned away\u2019 in people with high trait boundarylessness, so that strong DMN integrity no longer corresponds to a salient sense of self. Given our findings for the checking-in task of a negative linear correlation between boundarylessness and deactivation of the PCC/precuneus, it may be that the phenomenological difference between high and low scorers, who manifested the same level of DMN connectivity, was mediated by differences in the baseline activation of this DMN hub. The most likely interpretation of the lower PCC deactivation for highly boundaryless participants is that the baseline activity in the PCC was lower for them during the control condition (passively viewing symbols) and that the decrease in this region therefore was less pronounced for them when given a task. Decreased PCC activity is one of the most robust findings in studies on meditation, both as state and trait ( ,  ). PCC activity has been hypothesized to relate to being \u2018caught up\u2019 in experience, as in feeling attachment to or identifying with various things, such as holding on to an opinion, identifying as being a certain kind of person, or experiencing craving ( ), all things which appear to dissolve along with the sense of self-boundaries. It could thus be that a DMN with lower PCC activity is freed from some of the negative aspects associated with this network, while retaining the positive ones. \n\nA recent review of neural correlates of nondual awareness as a state and trait effects of meditation suggested a nonlinear path of changes in network connectivity ( ). Specifically, the authors suggested that DMN\u2013FPN connectivity and SLN activity show a U-shaped relation to meditation proficiency (and to trait nondual awareness, which was assumed to follow from all meditation training). Similarly,   hypothesized that increased anticorrelation is an intermediate step towards a sustained, effortless state of connectivity between these two networks. Although we did not find such a pattern for DMN\u2013FPN connectivity, there was a trend for SLN connectivity to follow this pattern (  and  ), and the SLN is known to mediate the shift between the other two networks ( ). \n\nThe nonlinear relation between boundarylessness and DMN connectivity was mostly driven by connectivity between the right IPL and mPFC. Interestingly,   reports increased connectivity between the right angular gyrus and mPFC as a correlate of nondual awareness meditation. Seed-based analysis of our data further revealed that connectivity between the right IPL and smaller clusters within the two other hubs of the DMN, the left angular gyrus/IPS and PCC/precuneus, was related to boundarylessness in the same way. The right IPL is known for its role in spatial self-location and perspective-taking ( ,  ,  ), and in a review,   suggest that sensed self-location is mediated by a TPJ\u2013PCC\u2013IPS network. Our findings thus suggest that the brain correlates of the sense of spatial self-location vary with boundarylessness in a U-shaped manner. Speculatively, it could be the case that a sense of boundedness\u2014as in being only one\u2019s body\u2014and a sense of boundarylessness\u2014as in being everywhere or everything\u2014share the neural underpinnings of \u2018embodiment\u2019, albeit of very different substrates. Indeed, results along these lines can be found in  , who found that participants prone to have out-of-body experiences expressed a kind of hyper-embodiment, and in  , who found that while some experiences of body boundary dissolution or out-of-body experiences were accompanied by decreased synchrony between the right posterior DMN hubs, others showed increased such synchrony. \n\nWe additionally found an inverted U-shaped relation between boundarylessness and mPFC activation during the processing of self-referential words, so that participants in the intermediate range of boundarylessness displayed a higher BOLD signal from this area. This finding can be interpreted in light of the qualitative analysis of interview data ( ), where we observed a quadratic relation between self-rated boundarylessness and the strength of perspectival ownership of experience. Participants who reported the highest levels of perspectival ownership identified as a kind of detached witness most of the time. This was described as a pleasant mode of being, attained after years of meditation. Participants assigned to this group self-rated in the intermediate range of boundarylessness. This is in stark contrast to descriptions by participants in the lowest and highest range of boundarylessness, who described a low or non-existent sense of perspectival ownership of experience. Most participants in the low end of boundarylessness did not at all relate to descriptions of witnessing experiences, whereas participants in the high end of boundarylessness described a nondual experience with no separation between experiencer and experience and thus no sense of being an experiencer of experiences. Based on this quadratic relation between boundarylessness and perspectival ownership in everyday self-experience, it is reasonable to assume that the quadratic relation of boundarylessness to mPFC activity, and possibly also that to DMN connectivity during rest, has something to do with this phenomenological construct. This interpretation is strengthened by the finding of an inverted U-shaped relation between boundarylessness and endorsing constancy words as descriptive of oneself during the SRP task, which pertained especially to positively valenced constancy words, such as \u2018evig\u2019 (eternal) and \u2018stabil\u2019 (stable). Endorsing such words seems to be well in line with the sense of a central self-core observing all experiences. As mentioned earlier, some previous findings indicate a role for the mPFC in minimal self (e.g.  ,  ,\u00a0  ). Intriguingly, in a case study of eight instances of altered self-experience ( ), the small reported changes in the phenomenological dimension \u2018Observing\u2019 in all cases varied in the same direction as mPFC synchrony strength, again indicative of a special role for the mPFC for the minimal sense of observing. Even though the SRP task was designed to elicit a narrative sense of self, it might be that participants with a strong sense of perspectival ownership adopted the stance of the observing witness towards the presented words, rather than narratively thinking about themselves as persons continuous through time. However, the suggestion that the mPFC is central to the sense of perspectival ownership of experience is contradicted by our finding of decreased activity at the group level in this area during the checking-in task, which aimed to enhance this sense. An alternative explanation might be that participants in the intermediate range of boundarylessness had lower baseline mPFC activity, which led to a larger increase in the self-referential task. This interpretation would, conversely, point towards a \u2018decrease\u2019 in mPFC activity as central to a strengthened sense of perspectival ownership of experience. \n\nThe review by   found that the results on mPFC activity was the most divergent of all network hubs investigated, which could be an indication that this area is especially prone to a nonlinear development with meditation practice. Indeed, the idea of a quadratic relation between brain activity and meditation proficiency can shed new light on the often contradictory findings on neural correlates of meditation ( ; see also  ). Various studies define meditation and proficiency differently, so that, e.g., someone with 2000\u2009hours of meditation experience is labelled \u2018beginner\u2019 in one study and \u2018expert\u2019 in another, depending on the rest of the sample. This complication can be largely remedied by instead using a phenomenological measure as the independent variable. \n\nA final, alternative approach would be to claim that the \u2018return to the beginner\u2019s brain\u2019 evinced by very boundaryless participants is a step backwards and that participants in the intermediate range of boundarylessness, with their lower DMN integrity and higher mPFC activity in response to SRP, exhibit an optimal way of functioning. Indeed, several participants self-rating in the intermediate range did mention being \u2018done\u2019 with their practice, having achieved a desired transformation of their sense of self with regard to functionality in everyday life. This suggestion would be in line with the common finding that neural extremes in either direction are suboptimal compared to the intermediate ( ). We cannot confirm whether the sentiment of an optimal functionality is correct as we did not include any measures of well-being in this study. \n\n\n### Brain correlates of focusing on the centre of experience \n  \nIt is clearly not warranted to conclude that we have been able to conclusively identify the neural correlates of the sense of perspectival ownership of experience via the checking-in task, as there is too much room for ambiguity regarding interpretation and execution of the instruction, and how this relates to the philosophical meaning of the concept. Indeed, if the Arrow condition had successfully captured the trait-level sense of perspectival ownership, we would have expected to see quadratic relations of brain data to boundarylessness, given the results of the interview analysis ( ). Instead, the only correlation of brain activation in this task to boundarylessness was linear: a negative correlation to PCC deactivation that, as mentioned earlier, can be assumed to stem from a lower baseline PCC activity in the more boundaryless participants. It is likely that this very basal aspect of self corresponds to kinds of brain activity that were not probed in this investigation, e.g. long-range temporal correlations as suggested by   or brain entropy as suggested by  . \n\nNevertheless, the group results for the exploratory checking-in task offer important information. We found that when participants were prompted to \u2018focus on the centre of their experience\u2019, there was decreased activation in the main DMN hubs as compared to passively viewing symbols, an expected finding for any task. As predicted, we also found increased activation in the bilateral anterior insula and a small part of the left thalamus. The main increase was however in a large, bilateral frontal cluster spanning almost the entire BA6. These findings converge with previous reports on brain correlates of meditation. Specifically, a pattern very similar to ours, including increases in the BA6, putamen, insula, and supramarginal gyrus and decreases in the PCC, precuneus, and angular gyrus, correlated with meditation onset in a study by  . It thus seems that this prompt led our group of participants, both non-meditators and advanced meditators, to a brain state very similar to that of beginning meditation. Despite quite a large disparity in the phenomenological descriptions (see\u00a0 ), our robust group-level result indicates a powerful effect of this instruction for participants with varying meditation experience and sense of self-boundaries. \n\nAlthough BA6 was not included as an a priori ROI for our investigation, this area has been implicated in many previous studies on sense of self.   found beta activity in the right premotor cortex as one of the effects of cueing for minimal self, and   found the right premotor cortex to be a correlate of both narrative self and self-related exteroceptive processing. In Dor-Ziderman et\u00a0al.\u2019s follow-up study ( ), activity in the right SMA diminished in the boundaryless condition.   investigated the EEG activity in the gamma-band for a single experienced meditator who entered four distinct states, one of which was \u2018self-dissolution\u2019. The gamma correlates of this state differed from the other states by increased activity in the right BA6. In the review by  , increases in BA6 were identified as correlates of three of the four types of meditation surveyed: open monitoring, focused attention, and mantra recitation, but not loving-kindness/compassion meditation. In their complementary review on structural effects of meditation, the BA6 was among the areas morphologically altered in meditators ( ). The authors speculate that this large region is involved in general attention regulation, specifically attention to the present moment, which is central to many styles of meditation ( ,  ). The right premotor cortex is also known to be involved in the sense of body ownership ( ,  ). Insular activation, as was also found at the group level, is likewise common to many kinds of meditation but most strongly related to meditation styles with a focus on bodily awareness ( ,  ). Explicit attention to the body during the checking-in condition was however only mentioned by 5 of our 24 participants in the post-scanning interviews. \n\nSeveral of the regions showing increased activation during checking-in, namely posterior inferior frontal sulcus, anterior insula, frontal operculum, and pre-SMA, are \u2018multiple demand regions\u2019, involved in many kinds of cognitive challenges and highly sensitive to meditation training ( ,  ). The anterior insula, premotor cortex, and specifically SMA/pre-SMA are also involved in the sense of agency ( ,  ). Agency is a fundamental aspect of the minimal self, and the finding that agency regions are engaged during checking-in can be taken to indicate that the sense of being an observer relates to the sense of being an agent, something which has been suggested by, among others,  . \n\n\n### Behavioural results \n  \nContrary to what we expected, there was no significant correlation between boundarylessness and endorsing positive words or not endorsing negative words as descriptive of oneself. This can be attributed to a ceiling effect, as most participants self-endorsed most words in both of these categories ( ). However, as predicted, a correlation was found regarding the fluidity words, most strongly so for the negatively valenced ones, such as \u2018ombytlig\u2019 (capricious) and \u2018tom\u2019 (empty): a larger proportion of these adjectives were endorsed as self-descriptive by participants who self-rated as being more boundaryless. For the constancy words a quadratic relation was found, as discussed earlier. \n\nSomewhat surprisingly, we found a correlation between boundarylessness and response times to simple math tasks. Previous studies indicate a correspondence between meditation experience and shorter response times to tasks (see   and   for reviews). For the SRP task there were no correlations with response times, in opposition to our expectation of shorter response times to the self task for more boundaryless participants. \n\n\n### Conclusions, limitations and recommendations \n  \nOf our a priori hypotheses, we found support for relations between boundarylessness and DMN connectivity in the resting state (U-shaped), with mPFC activity in the narrative self task (inverted U-shaped) and with PCC/precuneus activity in the minimal self task (negative). We also found that boundarylessness correlated with endorsing more fluidity words as self-descriptive, but rather than a negative relation with endorsing constancy words, there was again an inverted U-shaped relation to boundarylessness. A major caveat of the present study was the loss of brain data in ventral and dorsal brain areas for some participants in the task runs. Nevertheless, our analyses yielded interesting results for the included areas. We recommend future studies to investigate brain regions we could not investigate here, in particular the ventral mPFC. A larger sample size would have increased power, as would making group comparisons rather than correlation analysis. However, the sample did not easily lend itself to a group contrast; splitting the measure of interest, boundarylessness, by the mean was not warranted, and indeed our analyses showed that relevant information would have been lost by doing so. With a larger sample size and without the loss of data from superior and inferior brain areas in the task runs, it is likely that we would have found support for more of our hypotheses. \n\nWe did not differentiate between meditation techniques, which can be seen as a limitation. However, the focus was not on meditation per se but on variations in the trait-level sense of self-boundaries. Meditators were recruited simply because it is well known that meditation can induce alterations in trait self-experience, and participants did not meditate in the scanner. We recommend future studies to use a continuous rating tool, such as that developed by  , to assess trait boundarylessness. Substantial meditation experience can lead to different kinds of descriptions of trait-level changes in self-experience\u2014as involving a strengthened sense of self in the form of perspectival ownership of experience or, alternatively, as a nondual state that lacks this sense of self. Given our results, it seems that this differentiation is reflected in the brain. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10129386, "text_md5": "6638f5a420b136656a738ce1737e69d0", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 77], "journal": [78, 96], "publication_year": [98, 102], "title": [113, 170], "keywords": [184, 287], "abstract": [300, 1792], "body": [1801, 52714]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 37114163, "doi": "10.1093/nc/niad006", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10129386", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10129386"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10129386\">10129386</a>", "list_title": "PMC10129386  Nonlinear brain correlates of trait self-boundarylessness"}

This study aimed to identify patterns of gray matter volume (GMV) alteration specific to and common among patients with RLS, migraine, and comorbid migraine and RLS. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nHigh\u2010resolution T1\u2010weighted images were acquired from 116 subjects: 27 RLS patients, 22 migraine patients, 22 patients with comorbid migraine and RLS, and 45 healthy controls. Direct group comparisons and conjunction analysis were first used to localize the distinct and shared neural signatures of migraine and RLS. We also investigated whether the shared neural signature could be replicated in an additional comorbid migraine/RLS group. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nCompared with healthy controls, migraine patients showed GMV changes in the lateral occipital cortex, cerebellum, frontal pole, and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and RLS patients showed GMV changes in the thalamus, middle temporal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex, and MFG. In migraine, compared with RLS, GMV differences were found in the precuneus, lateral occipital and occipital fusiform cortex, superior frontal and precentral gyri, and cerebellum. Conjunction analyses for these disorders showed altered GMV in the MFG, also found in patients with comorbid migraine and RLS. The GMV of the MFG also correlated with sleep quality in patients with comorbid migraine and RLS. \n\n\n## Interpretation \n  \nMigraine and RLS are characterized by shared and distinctive neuroanatomical characteristics, with a specific role of the MFG. These findings may be related to shared pathophysiology of these two distinct disorders. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMigraine, a primary headache disorder affecting 10\u201320% of the general population, is characterized by recurrent attacks of moderate to severe pulsating headache lasting from 4 to 72 h. It is female\u2010predominant, with a female\u2010to\u2010male ratio of 2\u20133:1. Migraine attacks are often associated with photophobia, phonophobia, or nausea and vomiting, and are aggravated by physical activity.  Numerous other factors, including sleep, cardiovascular state, and mood disorders are strongly associated with migraine. ,   One of the most common comorbidities is restless legs syndrome (RLS). ,   RLS is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by a deeply uncomfortable sensation in the legs, especially when at rest or near bedtime, and relieved by voluntary movement. The prevalence of RLS is 5\u201310% in the general population in western countries, but substantially higher in patients with migraine (8.7\u201339.0%).  Furthermore, higher migraine frequency is associated with a higher prevalence of RLS.  Although several pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed linking migraine with RLS, including dopaminergic imbalances, dysfunction in iron metabolism, and genetic background variations, ,   little is known about the neural mechanisms governing the comorbidity of the two conditions. \n\nIn migraine, neuroanatomical alterations have been reported for a range of brain regions, including the insula; motor/premotor, prefrontal, cingulate, posterior parietal, orbitofrontal, and somatosensory cortices, and the caudate nucleus. ,  ,   The brain structural abnormalities in RLS patients are even more diverse, including increased gray matter volume (GMV) in the pulvinar,  ventral hippocampus, and middle orbitofrontal gyrus  and decreased GMV in the primary somatosensory cortex and primary motor area.  However, other studies yielded no specific GMV changes. ,  ,  ,   Although it is apparent that widespread brain areas are associated with both migraine and RLS, their common and distinct roles are still unclear. \n\nFew neuroimaging studies have investigated the shared and distinct neural properties of migraine and RLS.  In our recent resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs\u2010fMRI) study with a design comparing three clinical groups of individuals with migraine patients with and without RLS, and healthy controls, we observed disrupted functional connectivity (FC) in patients with migraine with and without RLS when compared with healthy controls.  Both groups exhibited FC changes, most prominently in attentional, nociceptive, control, and sensory\u2010related networks. It was unclear, however, whether these functional changes were related to structural changes. Moreover, no patients with RLS only were examined, leaving the question of comorbidity between migraine and RLS unaddressed. \n\nIn this study, therefore, to address the limitations of previous research and clarify the neural mechanisms of these two disorders, we used a T1 voxel\u2010based morphometry (VBM) approach and hierarchical study design to identify the shared and distinct neural signature of migraine, RLS, and both (that is, comorbidity). First, direct group comparisons and conjunction analysis were used to localize the distinct and shared neural signature of migraine and RLS. Second, we investigated whether the shared neural signature that appeared when either disease was present without the other, was also replicated in an additional comorbid migraine/RLS group. Finally, associations between the shared neural signature and clinical variables were also evaluated. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Tri\u2010Service General Hospital (TSGH); all participants provided informed written consent before enrollment. In this study, 116 participants were recruited consecutively from the Headache Clinic, Neurology Department of TSGH: 22 participants diagnosed with migraine (81.8% female; migraine with aura   n   = 4; migraine without aura,   n   = 18), 27 with RLS (74.0% female), 22 with comorbid migraine and RLS (95.4% female; migraine with aura,   n   = 5; migraine without, aura   n   = 17), and 45 healthy controls (73.3% female) with no history of neurological or psychiatric disease. \n\nThe diagnosis of migraine was defined according to the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders third edition (ICHD\u2010III).  Secondary or other concomitant primary headache disorders were excluded. In addition, we documented the clinical characteristics of participants diagnosed with migraine, including migraine duration, frequency, aura symptoms, family history, and headache intensity. Primary RLS was diagnosed based on the criteria outlined by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG),  after detailed history survey, physical examination, laboratory tests, and electromyography to exclude secondary RLS due to iron deficiency anemia, pregnancy, chronic renal disease, diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, Parkinson's disease, psychiatric illness, head injury, serious medical conditions, or history of drug or alcohol dependence. No patient was treated with dopaminergic agents, antidepressants, neuroleptics, or hypnotics. Other demographic and clinical data, including gender, age, RLS and migraine duration, and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) were also recorded. RLS severity was assessed using the IRLSSG rating scale.  No acute migraine or RLS attacks occurred during the scanning sessions. The healthy control group comprised volunteers without RLS or migraine, matched for age, gender, and handedness. Control participants were recruited through community advertisements and hospital patient pools. Exclusion criteria for control participants included a family history of RLS or migraine, prior diagnosis of a primary or secondary headache disorder, and any chronic pain condition. \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nAll T1\u2010weighted (T1w) structural scans were acquired at the TSGH on the same 3\u2010T Discovery MR750 scanner (General Electric Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) using an eight\u2010channel head array coil for signal detection. Axial three\u2010dimensional inversion recovery prepared fast spoiled gradient recalled (IR\u2010FSPGR) sequence with the following parameters was used for image acquisition: repetition time/echo time/inversion time = 10.17/4.16/450 msec; flip angle = 12\u00b0; number of excitations = 1; field of view = 256 \u00d7 256 mm ; matrix size = 256 \u00d7 256; 172 slices and 1 mm isotropic voxel size (without interpolation and interslice gap). An experienced neuroradiologist checked the raw anatomical scans visually to ensure that no gross brain abnormalities existed. To minimize variability in scanning position and further improve registration accuracy across study participants, we used a center\u2010of\u2010mass approach to reorient the image origin of each T1w scan automatically. \n\n\n### Diffeomorphic anatomical registration exponentiated lie algebra VBM \n  \nTo localize GMV changes among study groups, the VBM analytical framework was used.  Native\u2010space reoriented T1w scans were preprocessed with the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12, version 1266,  ) of Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12, version 7219, Wellcome Institute of Neurology, University College London, UK,  ) in Matlab R2016a (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) with default settings. All T1w scans were corrected for intensity nonuniformities, and then segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartments based on an adaptive maximum a posteriori method  and partial volume estimation model.  The resulting individual GM and WM tissue segments were spatially normalized to create study\u2010specific Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)\u2010space tissue templates, using the high\u2010dimensional Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) normalization approach.  As a high\u2010dimensional warping method, DARTEL estimates the deformation field between native space and MNI space for each individual. To obtain absolute tissue volume, the resulting MNI\u2010space GM tissue segments were further modulated by the linear and nonlinear components of the Jacobian determinant obtained from the DARTEL deformation fields. Finally, the resulting MNI\u2010space\u2010modulated GM images were spatially smoothed by convolving with an isotropic 8\u2010mm full\u2010width\u2010at\u2010half\u2010maximum Gaussian filter. The spatial resolution of the final preprocessed GM segments was 1.5 mm . After completing the entire VBM processing pipeline and visual inspection for incorrect preprocessing, the \u201cCheck Data Quality\u201d module of CAT12 was used to assess GM segment homogeneity and identify possible outliers. No participant was excluded in this step. Each total intracranial volume (TIV) was calculated as the sum of the GM, WM, and CSF volumes in native space and used as a potential confounding factor for adjusting global variation in brain size. We used a general linear model to remove the nuisance effects of age, gender, and TIV across all study participants, and the resulting GM residual maps were used as inputs for the subsequent statistical analyses. The individual unmodulated GM segments were averaged and thresholded at intensity 0.2 to create an explicit mask for exclusion of artifacts on the border between GM and WM (i.e., partial volume effect). \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \n#### Analyses of demographic, clinical evaluations, and neuroimaging data \n  \nAll statistical analyses of demographic data, clinical evaluations, and global tissue volumes were performed with SPSS Version 20 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The demographic data, clinical evaluations, and TIV were compared among the study groups by analysis of variance tests and Pearson's chi\u2010squared test, where appropriate, and were reported as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Moreover, we performed analysis of covariance with age, gender, and TIV as nuisance variables to compare global tissue volume (GM volume, WM volume, and CSF volume). The GLM_Flex toolbox ( ) and SPSS software were used for voxel\u2010wise statistical analyses and region of interest (ROI) analyses respectively. For all voxel\u2010wise statistical analyses, clusters with differences in GMV were considered statistically significant at the cluster\u2010level family wise\u2010error (FWE) corrected   P   < 0.05, with a cluster\u2010forming threshold of a voxel\u2010level   P   < 0.005 and 210 voxel extents. We used the command\u2010line tool 3dClustSim (10,000 permutations with explicit GM mask; version AFNI_17.3.01) to determine the statistical criterion. To ensure transparency and reusability of statistical results, we uploaded all the unthresholded statistical maps to the NeuroVault website ( ). \n\n\n#### Analysis of regional GMV differences between patients with migraine, RLS, and healthy controls to identify shared and distinct anatomical signatures \n  \nVoxel\u2010wise t\u2010tests were first performed based on the diagnosis and focused on the statistical contrasts of migraine versus healthy controls, and RLS versus healthy controls. Furthermore, we performed conjunction analysis to identify anatomical regions of shared GMV changes in patients with migraine and RLS. This analysis identified voxels that were significantly different in the relevant contrasts by searching for the intersection of the voxel\u2010wise FWE\u2010thresholded maps from patient\u2013control comparisons (migraine vs. healthy controls and RLS vs. healthy controls). In addition, a direct disease group comparison (migraine vs. RLS) was performed to identify anatomical regions with distinct GMV changes between these two patient groups. \n\n\n#### Replication analysis of shared neural signatures in the additional comorbid migraine/RLS group \n  \nWe used a two\u2010sample   t  \u2010test to investigate whole brain voxel\u2010wise GMV changes between patients with comorbid migraine and RLS and healthy controls. To further validate the results of the conjunction analysis described in the previous section, we overlapped these two voxel\u2010wise statistical results in the standard MNI\u2010space to check the spatial relationship between the two analyses. \n\n\n#### Relationship between regional GMV and clinical parameters \n  \nTo investigate the clinical associations in the group of patients with comorbid migraine and RLS, the anatomical regions identified by the conjunction analysis were extracted, averaged, and correlated with clinical characteristics, including migraine duration, migraine frequency, RLS duration, IRLSSG severity score, total PSQI score, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score, and Beck depression inventory (BDI) score, using Pearson's correlation. The threshold of statistical significance was set at uncorrected   P   < 0.05. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic data and clinical characteristics of the participants \n  \nThe major clinical characteristics of the participants are presented in Table  . The four groups were matched for age, gender, and handedness. All patients with migraine who reported aura had visual aura symptoms. Twelve of 22 (54.5%) patients with migraine had a positive family history for migraine. Furthermore, 11 of 27 (40.7%) patients with RLS had a positive family history for RLS; 11 of 22 (50.0%) patients with comorbid migraine and RLS had a positive family history for migraine, and 9 (40.9%) had a positive family history for RLS. There were no significant differences in total GMV, WM volume, CSF volume, or TIV among the four groups. None of the conventional T1 structural images from any participant showed morphological abnormalities or image artifacts. \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of study participants \n    \n\n### Regional GMV changes between migraine patients, RLS patients, and healthy controls \n  \n#### Migraine versus healthy controls \n  \nGMV differences in patients with migraine relative to healthy controls are shown in Table   and Figure  A (FWE corrected   P   value <0.05).

Relative to healthy controls, regions of smaller volume were observed in the right cerebellum and right temporal pole, while regions of greater volume were observed in the bilateral MFG and right precentral gyrus. Specifically, altered GMV was consistently found in the right MFG in patients with comorbid migraine and RLS relative to controls. \n  \nAnatomical regions with significant GMV changes in patients with comorbid migraine and RLS compared with the healthy control group \n      \nGMV differences between patients with comorbid migraine and RLS and the healthy control group as revealed by VBM.

Several regions, including the precuneus, superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, cerebellum and vermis, and occipital fusiform cortex, differed between the two disorders, indicating that each is associated with a spatially distinct pattern of pathophysiology. Our conjunction analysis also demonstrated that the two disorders share similar patterns of GMV changes in the MFG. Alterations in the GMV of this area were consistent in patients with comorbid migraine and RLS. Finally, we observed that the GMV of the MFG demonstrated a significant association with sleep quality. \n\nBoth migraine and RLS demonstrated several areas with GMV alternations relative to control groups. Migraine patients show increased sensitivity to light, which may be related to changes in cortical responsiveness involving lack of habituation to repeated visual stimulation, or to deficits in visual processing.  Studies have demonstrated that tonic pain can induce electroencephalographic and functional imaging changes in the occipital regions.  Therefore, the GMV changes in the occipital cortex may be related to visual hyperexcitability, or to changes in cerebral metabolism or neurotransmitter composition.  Previous research has suggested that the cerebellum and the deep cerebellar nuclei are related to trigeminal nociception and pain modulation.  In concordance with a previous study,  we found altered GMV in migraine patients in regions of the frontal lobes (frontal pole and MFG) that are thought to be part of the pain\u2010processing network and are also involved in executive functions.  Collectively, these GMV alterations may help to explain the interictal deficits of migraine patients in visual motion processing, pain modulation, and executive functions. \n\nWe found that patients with RLS showed GMV alterations in thalamus, middle temporal gyrus, ACC, insula, and MFG. The involvement of the thalamus accords with previous research indicating that GMV alterations of thalamic structures may be associated with the pathogenesis of RLS.  The temporal gyrus is connected with the frontal cortices (including MFG) and insula and is involved in pain perception and processing.  RLS pathogenesis was previously thought to be related to dysfunction of the sensorimotor and limbic systems, of which the ACC is an important component.  These functions may be related to the GMV changes between RLS patients and controls observed in this study, suggesting disruptions of these sensory\u2010related networks causing abnormal sensory\u2010motor integration and abnormal modulation of neural responses to aversive stimuli. \n\nOne of the main findings of the present study concerns the direct comparison between migraine and RLS. There are fundamental distinctions between the clinical presentations of migraine and RLS; therefore, marked differences in their neural structural signatures are also expected. To date, only a limited number of brain imaging studies have compared these conditions, either directly or indirectly.  Our previous functional imaging study reported FC differences in the salience, default mode to subcortical and frontoparietal, auditory to salience, and memory retrieval networks between migraine patients with and without RLS.  However, it remained unclear whether these functional changes were associated with structural changes, and no patients with RLS only were examined. Furthermore, the comparison between migraine and RLS may help disclose regions with structural changes that are associated with clinical differences and spatially distinct patterns for each pathophysiology. \n\nIn this study, the comparison between migraine and RLS groups revealed GMV differences in the precuneus, superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, cerebellum (vermis), and occipital fusiform cortex. We found several new regions that have not been reported previously in patients with migraine or RLS compared with healthy individuals, such as the superior frontal and precentral gyri, precuneus and occipital fusiform cortex, and vermis. These regions showed changes in GMV and are related to the frontal, occipital, and cerebellar networks, which are associated with nociceptive modulation and visual and motor processing. Thus, these differences may be associated with altered nociceptive control of sensory inputs and abnormal sensory\u2010motor integration, resulting in clinical differences and spatially distinct patterns of pathophysiology between migraine and RLS. \n\nConjunction analysis further indicated that the GMV of the MFG was robustly increased in both migraine and RLS groups. Frontal structural (including MFG) changes are associated with headache frequency in patients with episodic and chronic migraine.  MFG structural changes are also associated with executive function in patients with migraine.  Furthermore, patients with RLS have discernable brain structural alterations in the medial frontal lobe (including MFG).  MFG activation was also found in patients with RLS during active plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of both feet, suggesting an association with long\u2010standing RLS symptoms.  Additionally, the MFG is proposed as an area of convergence for attention networks that interrupts ongoing endogenous attentional processes and reorients attention to an exogenous stimulus.  The MFG may also be associated with pain modulation and inhibitory control.  Collectively, brain imaging evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of both migraine and RLS may be associated with dysfunction and modulation of nociceptive perception. ,   Therefore, the MFG may be critically involved in the comorbidity of migraine and RLS, although future research is warranted. \n\nOur study further highlighted that altered GMV relative to controls was consistently found in the MFG in patients with comorbid migraine and RLS. Additionally, our correlation analyses revealed that GMV in the MFG was negatively correlated with PSQI in patients with comorbid migraine and RLS. In other words, the better the sleep quality, the larger the GMV of the MFG in patients with comorbid migraine and RLS. Previous studies have reported that chronic primary insomnia patients showed significant GMV reduction in the prefrontal cortices (including MFG),  and a prior functional imaging study demonstrated that lower regional homogeneity of brain activity in the frontal gyrus (including MFG) in chronic primary insomnia patients than in sound sleepers.  Furthermore, evidence suggests that migraine and RLS are associated with a high frequency of poor sleep. ,   Considering these factors, we speculate that the GMV of the MFG is a potential biomarker for indexing sleep quality in patients with comorbid migraine and RLS. Collectively, the consistent finding of GMV alterations in the MFG reinforces the conclusion that the GMV alternations of the MFG may be related to the shared pathophysiology of these two disorders. Further work is necessary to confirm this hypothesis. \n\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate structural alterations in migraine patients, RLS patients, and patients with comorbid migraine and RLS. However, our study had several limitations. First, the sample size was modest, although we used a strict definition for well\u2010characterized diagnoses, which may decrease subject variability and ensure optimum detectability of group differences. Nevertheless, our preliminary/exploratory findings can be used to guide future large\u2010scale investigations, and future studies with larger samples are warranted to replicate and extend the present results. Second, we used a cross\u2010sectional group comparison design in this study; therefore, we could not determine causality. This means that it is not clear whether the observed alterations are part of the pathogenesis or consequences of these disorders. Future longitudinal studies may be required to determine whether the structural alterations are dynamic. Third, we used the statistical criteria with conservative Bonferroni corrected   P   < 0.05 in this study; however, we did not find any statistically significant results for our additional clinical correlation analyses. Using this approach may lower the Type I error, but it may increase Type II error rates. Therefore, to shed some light on the potential role of MFG in the pathophysiology of migraine and RLS comorbidity, we chose to report the final result with a more liberal statistical threshold of   P   < 0.05 (uncorrected). Finally, because in the present study most brain areas exhibiting GMV alteration were associated with higher cortical functions, future studies should employ cognitive testing (i.e., attention, execution, or visual) to better understand the relationships between these brain GMV alterations and cognition. \n\nIn conclusion, in this study, we observed altered GMV in patients with migraine, RLS, and comorbid migraine and RLS. The migraine and RLS groups exhibited distinct patterns of GMV alterations, predominantly in the frontal, occipital, and cerebellar areas. Both groups also displayed a common pattern of GMV changes predominantly affecting the MFG. Additionally, altered GMV in the MFG was consistently found in patients with comorbid migraine and RLS, and the GMV of this area also associated with sleep quality. Therefore, these findings suggest a potential anatomical signature related to the shared pathophysiology of these two disorders. \n\n\n## Author Contribution \n  \nStudy concept/design: F.C.Y., K.H.C., P.L.L., C.P.L., J.T.L.; data collection and analysis: F.C.Y., K.H.C., P.L.L., C.P.L., J.T.L.; data interpretation: F.C.Y., K.H.C., P.L.L., J.H.Y., S.Y.C.

However, scientific evidence for this claim is inconclusive and controversially debated. To assess the causal effect of VVGs on the behavioral and neural correlates of empathy and emotional reactivity to violence, we conducted a prospective experimental study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We recruited 89 male participants without prior VVG experience. Over the course of two weeks, participants played either a highly violent video game or a non-violent version of the same game. Before and after this period, participants completed an fMRI experiment with paradigms measuring their empathy for pain and emotional reactivity to violent images. Applying a Bayesian analysis approach throughout enabled us to find substantial evidence for the absence of an effect of VVGs on the behavioral and neural correlates of empathy. Moreover, participants in the VVG group were not desensitized to images of real-world violence. These results imply that short and controlled exposure to VVGs does not numb empathy nor the responses to real-world violence. We discuss the implications of our findings regarding the potential and limitations of experimental research on the causal effects of VVGs. While VVGs might not have a discernible effect on the investigated subpopulation within our carefully controlled experimental setting, our results cannot preclude that effects could be found in settings with higher ecological validity, in vulnerable subpopulations, or after more extensive VVG play. \n   eLife digest  \nViolent video games have often been accused of facilitating aggressive behaviour, in particular due to concerns that they could numb players toward real violence and therefore result in decreased empathy towards the pain of others. However, studies investigating these claims have often produced conflicting results, potentially due to methodological issues. For instance, work showing that violent games lead to emotional desensitization has often relied on testing participants immediately after a gaming session, which limits interpretations about prolonged impact. Many studies also compare gamers to people with no gaming experience, making it difficult to assess whether violent games decrease empathy, or whether less empathetic individuals are more likely to be drawn to this content. \n\nLengersdorff et al. aimed to examine the long-term effects of violent video games using an experimental design that would bypass some of these limitations. A group of 89 young men with little gaming experience were recruited to play either a highly or non-violent version of the same game for seven hour-long sessions over two weeks. The way their brain reacted to violent images and processed other people\u2019s pain was assessed before and after this \u2018gaming training\u2019 using fMRI. The analyses showed no changes in these measures in volunteers who played the violent version of the game, suggesting that it had not numbed them to violence or affected their empathy. \n\nWhile experimental studies cannot fully capture the experiences of real-world gamers, the findings by Lengersdorff et al. represent a step towards resolving the scientific controversy surrounding the effects of violent games. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of how this type of media influences our emotions could help inform policymaking decisions about access to violent content. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nVideo games have evolved into one of the most popular forms of entertainment. In Europe, 25% of the population report playing video games weekly, and especially young adults spend much time in these \u2018virtual worlds\u2019 ( ). Many popular games contain high levels of violent imagery, with the killing or hurting of other characters being deeply engrained in the gameplay ( ;  ). Many recent studies have investigated whether such violent video games (VVGs) have adverse effects on real-world social behavior and empathy ( ). According to the influential general aggression model ( ), VVGs should decrease the players\u2019 empathy for the pain of others by desensitizing them to both virtual and real violence. Such desensitizing effects should in turn be reflected by decreased activity in brain areas underpinning empathy, such as the anterior insula (AI) and the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) ( ;  ). However, the evidence for this prediction is mixed. While some studies found that playing VVGs leads to emotional desensitization on the behavioral and neural level ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), other studies failed to reveal such effects ( ;  ;  ;  ). Conflicting results are also found on the level of systematic reviews ( ;  ). Several meta-analyses suggest that VVGs exert small, yet consistent adverse effects on aggression and empathy ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Other researchers contest these results, claiming that results are a product of selective reporting and biased analyses ( ;  ). \n\nA key question is whether VVGs are causally responsible for low empathy, or whether less empathic individuals are more likely to play VVGs ( ;  ). Many studies have been quasi-experimental in nature, comparing the empathic responses of participants who habitually play VVGs with those of participants without VVG experience ( ;  ;  ;  ). Such designs provide limited information on the direction of the causal link between VVGs and decreased empathy. The existing experimental studies have nearly always used VVGs as an experimental manipulation shortly before measuring the outcomes of interest ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). While these studies consistently report evidence for a desensitizing effect of violent games, they cannot disentangle the immediate effects of VVG play from those that have a persistent, long-term impact on individuals. Immediate VVG effects may encompass a wide range of processes, such as priming ( ), as well as stress-like responses such as increases in active fear and aggressive behaviors ( ;  ;  ) that include generally increased sympathetic activity, release of stress hormones, heightened activation of involved brain structures, and cognitive-affective responses (e.g. deep reflection on the seen content, and changes in emotions and mood). Such responses can persist on a timescale of minutes to hours after aversive events such as VVG exposure, and have been shown to negatively affect social behavior ( ). It is important to distinguish these immediate effects from longer-term adaptations that occur over days or weeks, such as habituation or memory consolidation processes. The general aggression model predicts that the repeated exposure to violence in the positive emotional context of videogames leads to the gradual extinction of aversive reactions, resulting in the long-term desensitization of players to real-world violence ( ). \n\nIt is therefore essential to conduct experimental studies that can disentangle the long- and short-term effects of VVGs in participants without prior VVG experience. One first such study was conducted by  , who found no significant effects of VVGs on empathy and its neural correlates. While this study was an important starting point, four important design features limited its conclusions. First, the researchers used very dissimilar games in the experimental group versus the control group, restricting the comparability of the two conditions. Second, while the participants of the experimental group were asked to play the violent game   Grand Theft Auto V   (Rockstar Studios) for 30 min per day over 2 months  ,   the authors did not control the degree to which participants actually played the game. Third, the authors did not control that participants actually committed violent acts within the game, as the game offers a large amount of gameplay without violent content. Fourth, the absence of significant results was interpreted as evidence for the absence of VVG effects. However, the authors did not report the results of equivalence tests ( ) or Bayesian hypothesis tests ( ) that would support such claims conclusively ( ). In view of the many conflicting results reported by experimental research and even meta-analyses ( ;  ), clearly differentiating between \u2018absence of evidence\u2019 and \u2018evidence of absence\u2019 is particularly important. \n\nTo test possible causal effects of VVGs on empathy and its neural correlates, we conducted an experimental prospective study, which addressed each of these limitations. Eighty-nine male participants with little to no prior VVG experience repeatedly played a modified version of   Grand Theft Auto V   over the course of 2 weeks. Participants in the experimental group played a highly violent version of the game and were tasked to kill as many other characters as possible. Participants of the control group played a version of the same game from which all violent content was removed, and were asked to perform a non-violent task (taking photographs of other characters). Before and after this gaming period, participants completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session during which we measured the behavioral and neural correlates of empathy for pain and emotional reactivity to violent images (see   and Methods: Experimental fMRI sessions for details). We used Bayesian hypothesis tests to assess whether there were negative effects of VVGs on participants\u2019 empathic behavior and neural responses. Hypothesis tests were performed by means of the Bayes factor (BF;  ). We followed the convention to report a BF>3 as evidence for the alternative hypothesis, a BF<1/3 as evidence for the null hypothesis, and a BF in the interval [1/3, 3] as inconclusive evidence for either hypothesis ( ;  ). We would like to emphasize, though, that the BF provides an easily interpretable continuous quantification of the evidence for and against hypotheses, and that a strict categorization of BFs into evidence for and against hypotheses is not necessary. Our aim was to provide conclusive evidence on the question whether VVGs can desensitize humans to the plight of others or not, within our carefully balanced experimental model. \n   Schematic depiction of the experimental tasks.  \n(  A  ) Empathy-for-pain task. In trials of the Self condition, participants passively received electrical stimuli. In the Other condition, participants experienced how another person (a confederate) received electrical stimuli. The stimuli were either painful or not painful. In the cue phase, an arrow indicated the recipient (downwards: Self; right: Other) and the intensity (blue: not painful; red: painful) of the next stimulus. In the stimulation phase, the stimulus was delivered. After half of the trials, participants were asked to rate the last stimulus. The confederate depicted has given informed consent that his photograph can be published. (  B  ) Emotional reactivity task. Participants were presented pictures with different content (violent or neutral) and different context (real or game context). After observing a block of pictures, participants rated their current unpleasantness on a visual analog scale from 0 to 100. \n  \n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral data \n  \n#### Descriptive statistics of gaming behavior \n  \nForty-five participants took part as part of the experimental group, and 44 participants as part of the control group. On average, participants of the experimental group killed 2844.7 characters (SD = 993.9, median = 2820, minimum = 441, maximum = 6815). Participants of the control group took an average of 3055.3 pictures of other characters (SD = 1307.5, median = 3026, minimum = 441, maximum = 6815). Thus, as was the aim of our experimental design, each participant of the experimental group was exposed to a substantial number of violent acts in the video game. \n\n\n#### Empathy for pain \n  \nTo test our central hypothesis, we investigated if participants who played the VVG showed decreased empathy for pain on the behavioral level. We analyzed the ratings obtained during the empathy-for-pain task with a hierarchical Bayesian censored regression model. We modeled fixed effects for the experimental factors   Group   (non-violent vs. violent gaming, coded as \u20131 and 1),   Time   (pre vs. post gaming sessions, coded as \u20131 and 1), and   Intensity   (non-painful vs. painful stimulation of the confederate, coded as \u20131 and 1), as well as all interactions between these factors. See Methods: Data analysis for more details. \n\nThe posterior means of fixed effect parameters are listed in  .A for painfulness ratings, and  .B for unpleasantness ratings. As a manipulation check, we first tested whether painful stimuli led to increased painfulness and unpleasantness ratings, compared to non-painful stimuli. For both kinds of ratings, this test revealed very strong evidence (BF>100) for an effect of   intensity  , indicating that our paradigm was able to induce empathic responses in participants (see  ). The posterior mean of the regression parameter   \u03b2   of the factor   Intensity   was 27.86 for painfulness ratings, and 17.48 for unpleasantness ratings. Given our used factor coding, this means that the average difference in ratings between painful and non-painful stimuli was 2*27.86=55.72 points of the 100-point VAS for painfulness ratings, and 2*17.48=34.96 points for unpleasantness ratings. \n   Behavioral results.  \nDepicted are participants\u2019 ratings during the empathy-for-pain task (  A   and   B  ) and the emotional reactivity task (  C  ). Ratings were given on a visual analog scale (range: 0\u2013100). (  A  ) Empathy for pain, painfulness rating. Question text: \u2018How painful for the other?\u2019. (  B  ) Empathy for pain, unpleasantness rating. Question text: \u2018How unpleasant for yourself?\u2019. Note that an apparent trend toward a three-way interaction Group*Session*Intensity is not supported by the respective Bayesian hypothesis test (BF = 0.130,  ). (  C  ) Emotional reactivity, unpleasantness rating. Question text: \u2018How unpleasant?\u2019. Boxes: the middle line marks the group mean of participant ratings in the respective condition; the box represents the 95% credible interval of the posterior predictive distribution of mean ratings. Dots depict the individual mean ratings of participants, lines depict the 95% credible interval of the posterior predictive distribution of mean ratings of single participants. Control game group: N = 44. Violent game group: N = 45. \n     Posterior parameter means of models for ratings in the empathy-for-pain task.  \nDependent variable: empathy ratings (visual analog scale, range: 0\u2013100). Factor codings: Group: control game group = \u20131, violent game group = 1; Session: first session = \u20131, second session = 1; Intensity: non-painful = \u20131, painful = 1. Bayes factors were derived from comparing a model where the respective parameter was unrestricted to a model where it was restricted to zero. \u2020These Bayes factors were derived from comparing a model where the parameter was restricted to be negative to a model where it was restricted to zero (one-sided hypothesis test). \n  \nWe found evidence for the absence of a VVG effect on the painfulness ratings. Comparing a model where the fixed effect of   Group*Time*Intensity   could be negative to a model where the effect was set to zero resulted in a BF of 0.324. This means that the observed ratings were about 3.1 times more likely under the null hypothesis of no VVG effect than under the alternative hypothesis. When estimated without restrictions, the posterior mean of   \u03b2   for the interaction   Group*Session*Intensity   was \u20130.78. Given our factor codings, this means that the quantity [rating  \u2013 rating ]  \u2013 [rating  \u2013 rating ]  (thus, the baseline-corrected empathic response) was on average 1.56 points smaller in the experimental group than in the control group, on the 100-point VAS. However, note that the Bayesian hypothesis test suggests that a model with this interaction restricted to zero provides a better explanation of the data. \n\nFor the unpleasantness ratings, evidence for absence of a VVG effect was substantial. With a BF of 0.130, the observed data were about 7.7 times more likely under the null hypothesis of no VVG effect than under the alternative hypothesis. The posterior mean of   \u03b2   for the interaction   Group*Session*Intensity   was \u20130.45. Given our factor codings, this means that the quantity [rating  \u2013 rating ]  \u2013 [rating  \u2013 rating ]  was on average 0.9 points smaller in the experimental group than in the control group. However, note again that the Bayesian hypothesis test suggests that a model without this interaction provides a better explanation of the data. \n\nIn summary, the behavioral data suggest that VVG play as implemented in this study has no effect on either type of empathy rating. \n\n\n#### Emotional reactivity \n  \nNext, we investigated whether playing the VVG desensitized participants toward depictions of violence. We again used a hierarchical Bayesian censored regression model, and included fixed effects for the experimental factors   Group   (non-violent vs. violent gaming, coded as \u20131 and 1),   Content   (neutral vs. violent, coded as \u20131 and 1), and   Context   (real vs. game, coded as \u20131 and 1). \n\nThe posterior means of fixed effect parameters of this model are listed in  . As a manipulation check, we first tested whether participants experienced more unpleasantness in the emotional reactivity task while observing violent pictures compared to neutral pictures. We found very strong evidence (BF>100) for this hypothesis, indicating that our paradigm was successful in inducing unpleasantness by violent imagery. The posterior mean of the regression parameter   \u03b2   of the factor   Content   was 37.08. This means that the average difference in ratings between violent and neutral stimuli was 74.16 points of the 100-point VAS. The unpleasantness ratings are depicted in  . \n   Posterior parameter estimates of models for ratings in the emotional reactivity task.  \nDependent variable: unpleasantness ratings (visual analog scale, range: 0\u2013100). Factor codings: Group: control game group = \u20131, violent game group = 1; Content: neutral = \u20131, violent = 1; Context: real = \u20131, game = 1. Bayes factors were derived from comparing a model where the respective parameter was unrestricted to a model where it was restricted to zero. \u2020These Bayes factors were derived from comparing a model where the parameter was restricted to be negative to a model where it was restricted to zero (one-sided hypothesis test). \n  \nFurther, we found substantial evidence for the absence of a desensitizing VVG effect. Comparing a model where the fixed effect of   Group*Content   could be negative to a model where the effect was set to zero resulted in a BF of 0.151. Thus, participants of the violent game group did not show a decreased emotional response toward depictions of real and game violence. Moreover, testing the fixed effect of   Group*Content*Context   resulted in a BF of 0.094, indicating that there was also no desensitizing effect that was specific to depictions of game violence. When estimated without restrictions, the regression parameters associated with both interactions were positive,   \u03b2  =2.28 for   Group*Content,   and   \u03b2  =0.33 for   Group*Content*Context  . This means that, ostensibly, participants in the experimental group had a very weak tendency to rate violent images as more unpleasant than participants in the control group, contrary to expectations. However, note again that the Bayesian hypothesis test suggests that a model without these interactions provides a better explanation of the data. In summary, the behavioral data suggest that playing the VVG did not emotionally desensitize participants toward violent images. \n\n\n\n### fMRI data \n  \n#### Empathy for pain \n  \nWe next analyzed the fMRI data collected during the empathy-for-pain task. To define our regions of interest (ROIs), we first performed whole-brain general linear model (GLM) analysis of the data of the first fMRI session. Our contrast of interest [  Other Pain \u2013 Other No Pain  ] compared brain activity when the confederate experienced painful stimulation to activity when the confederate experienced only non-painful stimulation (see Methods: Data analysis for details). This revealed significant clusters in our a priori defined brain areas of interest, aMCC and bilateral AI, as well as in other areas, including the left supramarginal gyrus and the right angular gyrus (see  , and Appendix 3 for detailed results). Subsequently, we performed Bayesian linear mixed effects analyses on the data extracted from the ROIs (aMCC, left AI, right AI). See Methods: Data analysis for details. We compared models where the fixed effect of   Group*Time*Intensity   could be negative to a model where the effect was set to zero. For responses in the   Cue   phase (where participants were informed whether the other person would receive a painful or a non-painful stimulus), we obtained the following BFs: BF  = 0.402; BF  = 0.547; BF  = 0.190. For responses in the   Stimulation   phase (where participants observed the other person receiving the stimulus), we obtained the following BFs: BF  = 0.176; BF  = 0.143; BF  = 0.434. See   for posterior distributions and BFs of all model parameters. In summary, we found weak to moderate evidence for the absence of an effect of playing the VVG on participants\u2019 brain activity while they observed another person in pain. \n   Results of the whole-brain analyses for region-of-interest definition.  \n(  A  ) Empathy-for-pain task. Clusters represent areas where brain activity was increased when the confederate received a painful electrical stimulus, compared to a non-painful stimulus. (  B  ) Emotional reactivity task. Clusters represent areas where brain activity was increased during the observation of violent images, compared to neutral images. All results p<0.05 FWE-corrected. This figure was made with the software MRICron ( ). \n  \n\n#### Emotional reactivity \n  \nOur next analysis concerned the fMRI data coming from the emotional reactivity task. To define our ROIs, we computed the contrast [  Violent \u2013 Neutral  ], comparing brain activity during observation of violent images to brain activity during observation of images with neutral content (see Methods: Data analysis for details). This revealed significant clusters in one of our a priori areas of interest, the bilateral amygdala, as well as several other regions, such as the bilateral fusiform gyrus and the bilateral precentral gyrus (see   and Appendix 3 for detailed results). However, we found no significant clusters in the other brain ROIs, the aMCC or the bilateral AI. Therefore, we restricted our subsequent ROI analysis to the amygdala. \n\nWe performed Bayesian linear mixed effects analyses on the data extracted from the amygdala. See Methods: Data analysis for details. First, we compared a model where the fixed effect of   Group*Content   could be negative to a model where the effect was set to zero. This resulted in a BF of 0.324 for the left amygdala, and a BF of 0.338 for the right amygdala, indicating absence of an effect in both ROIs. Next, we tested the fixed effect of   Group*Content*Context  . With a BF of 0.205 for the left amygdala, and 0.163 for the right amygdala, this analysis also indicated the absence of an effect. See   for posterior distributions and BFs of all model parameters. In summary, the data suggest that playing the VVG did not lead to a dampened brain response to images of violence in neither real nor gaming contexts. \n\n\n\n### Post hoc analyses \n  \n#### Sample comparability \n  \nWe constrained our sample to young adult (18\u201335 years) males who had minimal prior exposure to VVGs in general, and who had not played the game used in the study before. However, given the great popularity of VVGs among young adult males, it is also possible that this constrained our sample to a subpopulation that is less susceptible to desensitization effects to begin with. Therefore, we tested whether the subpopulation from which we drew our sample exhibited higher levels of trait empathy than the general population. To achieve this, we compared the trait empathy levels of our sample, as measured by the Questionnaire for Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE;  ), to those of a control sample of 18- to 35-year-old males who were not preselected for minimal VVG use. See Methods: Data analysis: Post hoc analyses for more details. \n\nThe results are depicted in  . For all subdimensions, Bayesian   t  -tests provided moderate to substantial evidence for the hypothesis that there is no difference between the two groups (BF<1/3). Thus, our exploratory analysis suggests that our inclusion criterion of minimal VVG exposure did not result in a preselection of individuals with extraordinarily high levels of empathy. \n   Comparison of trait empathy levels between experimental group and control group.  \nBayes factors were derived from comparing a model where the mean difference violent video game (VVG) group \u2013 Control group was positive to a model where it was restricted to zero (one-sided Bayesian   t  -test). \n  \n\n#### Test-retest reliabilities \n  \nIn this study, we measured a number of behavioral and neural correlates in two experimental sessions \u2013 once before the exposure to the VVG or the control game, once after. Thus, the test-retest reliability (i.e. the correlation between the two measurements of a variable) is of interest, as this informs us about the relative stability of our outcome variables of interest. This also affects the statistical power of our performed tests (see next section). \n\nFor analysis details, see Methods: Data analysis: Post hoc analyses. We found that the test-retest reliability of our behavioral measures of empathy (i.e. participants\u2019 ratings) was high to very high (painfulness ratings:   \u03c1  =0.768, 95% credible interval = [0.613, 0.879]; unpleasantness ratings:   \u03c1  =0.905, 95% credible interval = [0.813, 0.967]). However, we observed very low test-retest reliability for our neural measurements of empathy (aMCC signal:   \u03c1  =\u20130.013, 95% credible interval = [\u20130.420, 0.402]; left AI signal,   \u03c1  =\u20130.001, 95% credible interval = [\u20130.423, 0.414]; right AI signal,   \u03c1  =0.027, 95% credible interval = [\u20130.377, 0.416]). \n\n\n#### Bayesian design analyses \n  \nWe based our sample size on the results of a power analysis designed for the frequentist inference framework (see section Methods: Power analysis). However, as we ultimately based our inference on BF tests, the theoretical long-term behavior of these tests, given our sample size and expected effect size, is of interest. This also informs us about the effect sizes that could realistically have been detected using our sample size. Therefore, we conducted a post hoc BF design analysis by means of a Monte Carlo simulation experiment ( ). See Methods: Data analysis: Post hoc analyses for analysis details. It is of particular importance to note that the diagnosticity of hypothesis tests involving repeated measurements does also depend on the correlation between the repeated measures, i.e., the test-retest reliability. \n\nThe results are presented in  . In summary, the simulation experiment suggested that our behavioral analyses, for which test-retest reliabilities were high, were well enough powered to differentiate between the absence and presence of a medium-to-small effect of   d  =0.3. Note that this effect size is smaller than the lower bound of effect size estimates reported in the meta-analysis of  , which was   d  =0.345. For smaller effects, such as   d  =0.2, the a priori power of our behavioral analyses was not optimal, as it would have been likely that we would have obtained an inconclusive result (1/3<BF<3) even in the presence of a true effect of that size. However, given that we obtained evidence for the null hypothesis (BF<1/3) in all relevant BF tests on our behavioral data, our results speak strongly against the presence of such an effect. \n   Results of the Bayes factor design analysis.  \nDepicted are the estimated probabilities of inferential decisions for each dependent variable and assumed true effect size   d  .

The estimated probabilities of correct decisions (evidence for H0 when   d  =0.0, evidence for H1 when   d  >0.0) are marked in bold. \n  \nRegarding our neural analyses, given the low correlation between repeated measurements (i.e. test-retest reliability), the Bayesian power of our fMRI analyses should be regarded as low. Taken alone, we would not consider them convincing evidence against the presence of a VVG effect. However, together with our behavioral results, they suggest that VVG effects, if they exist, can be expected to be very small. \n\n\n#### Cross-task correlations \n  \nGiven that we measured empathy for pain and emotional reactivity in the same subjects, our data also allowed us to investigate the relationships between these two phenomena. For this, we calculated the correlations between the behavioral and neural measurements of our outcome variables. The results are presented in  . We can observe that for our behavioral measures, cross-task correlations were substantial (  r  =0.227 \u20130.280, with all credible intervals not covering zero). However, we could observe no substantial cross-task correlations for our neural measures, or across neural and behavioral indicators. \n   Cross-task correlations.  \nAbove diagonal: posterior means of correlations.

Here, we report evidence against this hypothesis in relation to our specific setting. We found that participants who repeatedly played a highly violent game for 7 hr over the course of 2 weeks did not show decreased empathy for another person\u2019s pain or decreased responses to violent imagery. \n\nOur findings contrast with several earlier studies that found a negative relationship between playing VVGs and empathic responses to violence. Importantly, the majority of these studies were quasi-experimental in nature, and therefore provide only limited evidence for a putative causal effect of violent gaming ( ;  ;  ;  ). Moreover, the few experimental studies that exist implemented designs investigating short-term carryover effects, as they had exposed participants to virtual violence rather immediately before measurements of their outcome variables of interest ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Together with the study of  , our study is one of the first to investigate persistent effects of VVGs in participants without prior experience with them, enabling a clear assessment of the causality of VVG effects. Importantly, our study was designed to address several limitations of the study of K\u00fchn et al.: We strictly controlled the amount of virtual violence actually experienced by participants, and used a non-violent version of the same game in the control condition; moreover, we applied a Bayesian analytical approach, which, together with our comparatively large sample size, enabled us from the outset to distinguish \u2018absence of evidence\u2019 from \u2018evidence of absence\u2019 of VVG effects. This approach yields consistent evidence from both behavioral and neural data that VVGs, to the extent and characteristics played in our interventional design, are not causally responsible for a persistent lack of empathy or emotional desensitization to violence. \n\nDespite the aforementioned strengths of our study, we also need to address several limitations. Our experimental design ensured that participants of the experimental group were exposed to a substantial amount of violent gameplay during gaming sessions (each participant \u2018killed\u2019 an average of 2845 other characters in a graphically violent way). However, the overall exposure to virtual violence was still very low when compared to the amount that is possible in the everyday life of typical VVG players. During our experiment, participants played for 7 hr over the course of 2 weeks. However, habitual gamers can play an average of 16 hr in the same time frame ( ;  ). Our results cannot preclude that longer and more intense exposure to VVGs could have negative causal effects on empathy. In particular, adolescents and children as well as persons with specific neuropsychiatric traits might be especially susceptible to long-term changes due to increased brain plasticity. However, empirically testing higher levels of violence with the same degree of control as realized in our study would reach the limits of practical feasibility. We thus believe that our results provide an important perspective on the size of VVG effects that could realistically be expected in experimental research. \n\nTo increase experimental control, we restricted our sample to young adult males who had minimal prior exposure to VVGs. It is possible that, due to this strict preselection criterion, our sample was drawn from a subpopulation that is particularly resistant to desensitization. An exploratory analysis provided strong evidence that our selection criterion did not result in particularly high levels of trait empathy in our sample, though. However, we cannot preclude that our sample was particularly resistant to VVG effects due to other, untested characteristics. Further research is needed to assess if our results generalize to samples with other characteristics that may be more representative for the general population. \n\nTo maximize the amount of violence that participants would be exposed to (and commit) in the game, we restricted the game\u2019s objective to killing other characters, and incentivized this behavior with monetary rewards. This might have reduced the ecological validity of our operationalization of gaming, and it is possible that bigger effects could be seen when violent gameplay is more internally motivated, i.e., individuals who want to play the game may be differently affected than those that have merely accepted to be part of an experiment. Still, our results provide valid evidence that the mere exposure to virtual violence for 7 hr over 2 weeks is not sufficient to decrease empathy. \n\nIt should be noted that there are few studies that connect laboratory-based experimental investigations of empathy and emotional reactivity to real-world behavior and its measures. There are indications, however, that neuroscientifc empathy measures similar to the ones used here predict individual social behavior (e.g. donation, helping, or care-based behavior;  ;  ;  ;  ), and that they are also validated by their predictivity of mental or preclinical disorders characterized by deficits in empathy ( ;  , for review). That said, it is obvious that future research is needed that bridges and integrates laboratory and field-based measures and approaches, in order to inform us how changes (or their absence) in neural responses induced by VVG play are connected to real-life social emotions and behaviors (see  , for a recent example illustrating, in the domain of social isolation research, how a combined lab- and field-based study can be directly informed by prior laboratory-based neuroscience findings). \n\nOur study was designed to reliably detect an effect size of   d  =0.3, an effect even smaller than the lower estimate for VVG effects on empathy reported in  . Our results provide substantial evidence that effects of this magnitude are not present in settings similar to our experimental design. These arguments notwithstanding, it needs to be noted that future studies with higher power may detect still smaller effects. Considering the high prevalence of VVG, even such small effects could be of high societal relevance ( ). For now, based on the current design and data, we can conclude that experimental long-term VVG effects on empathy are unlikely to be as large as previously reported. \n\nIt may be argued that the empathy for pain paradigm and the associated behavioral and neural responses are so robust and resistant to changes by external factors that this may explain the lack of evidence for the effects of VVG play. This argument however would contradict a wealth of findings illustrating malleability of empathic responses using this and related designs, including with placebo analgesia ( ;  ;  ), an intervention that usually shows low to moderate effect sizes as well (see e.g.  ;  ;  , for review). \n\nLastly, and somewhat surprisingly, we found that the test-retest reliability of our neural covariates of empathy for pain were close to zero for all investigated ROIs. Knowing that an individual\u2019s neural empathic response (blood oxygen level-dependent [BOLD] activity for seeing somebody else in pain vs. in no pain) was above or below average in the first session provides little to no information about their relative response in the second session. To the best of our knowledge, our study was the first one to present the empathy for pain paradigm to the same sample of participants after a longer time frame. Thus, this surprising result provides valuable information on the limitations of this task respectively the neural measurements acquired in it, and certainly demands further research to investigate the factors influencing fMRI reliability (see also  ;  ). We would like to emphasize, though, that a high test-retest reliability is not a precondition for the valid testing of group-level effects. For a group-level effect to be testable, it is only necessary that the mean of the dependent variable is consistently affected by the independent variable. It is not necessary that participants who show an above average level in the DV in one session also show an above average level in the second session, and vice versa. Otherwise, there would also be no point in independent-sample designs. Indeed, it has recently been discussed that highly robust cognitive tasks are bound to exhibit low test-retest reliability, as robust tasks are often characterized by low interindividual variation, and thus leave only little variance that can be explained by participant traits ( ). However, it must also be noted that low reliability does lead to lower power of repeated measures designs. As discussed above, the low reliability of the measured neural responses has resulted in suboptimal power of our tests on fMRI data. \n\nIn summary, our findings stand in contrast to claims that posit the playing of violent games as an essential factor for explaining decreases in empathy. If this is shown to generalize to when people play more often and over longer periods, the desensitization to violence described in prior reports using quasi-experimental designs might have been caused by third and pre-existing factors, such as education, socio-economic status, or mental health issues ( ;  ;  ;  ). Together with similar findings ( ), our results point out the limits to which VVGs can be held responsible for lacks of empathy, at least in highly controlled experimental settings that last for the 2 weeks of play implemented here. This is not to say, though, that there is no point in further investigating the complex relationships between violent media use and adverse social behavior. We propose that the design and analysis approach of the present study could act a reference of how future studies should be conducted, in order to increase the stringency and robustness of research in this domain. Together with our findings, such studies will aid in resolving the scientific controversy regarding the negative effects of VVGs ( ;  ), and contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between violent media and emotion. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Power analysis \n  \nWe planned to collect data from 90 participants. We derived this sample size from a power analysis based on VVG effect sizes reported in the meta-analysis of  . The authors estimated the size of the negative VVG effect on empathy/desensitization to be   r  =0.194, 95% CI = [0.170, 0.217], which corresponds to Cohen\u2019s   d  =0.396, 95% CI = [0.345, 0.445], representing a small-to-medium effect. We chose   d  =0.300 as the minimum effect size for which we wanted to achieve a power of 0.80, to ensure that we would have enough power even if the reported effect size was overestimated. Note that thus, the effect size we used was even smaller than the lower bound reported in  . We performed the power analysis using the software Gpower 3.1.9.2 ( ), calculating the required sample size to achieve a power of 0.8 for the interaction in a 2-by-2 within-between design ANOVA, assuming a medium correlation of 0.5 between repeated measures, and using the conventional alpha error level of 0.05. This resulted in a required sample size of 90. Using such a sample size, the achieved power for the effect size reported in  , as well as its lower and upper bound, was as follows: for   d  =0.345, achieved power = 0.901; for   d  =0.396, achieved power = 0.960; for   d  =0.445, achieved power = 0.986. \n\nPlease note that while this power analysis was based on a frequentist analysis framework, we are reporting Bayesian analyses here. However, we considered this power analysis to be a sensible benchmark for the sample size needed to answer our research questions. See Results: Post hoc analyses: Bayesian design analysis for a Bayesian design analysis that provides more information on the size of effects that could be detected with our sample size using Bayesian analyses. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nIn total, 97 participants completed the first experimental session. Of these, eight participants dropped out of the study (six before the first video game sessions; two after, of which one was from the experimental group and one from the control group). We thus acquired complete datasets from 89 participants. \n\nTo control for previous VVG exposure, we only included individuals that had not played VVGs at least 12 months before testing, and had not played the video game   Grand Theft Auto V   before. We did this to avoid a possible ceiling effect: participants who had already played these games before might already have been desensitized too much for our experimental VVG exposure to show any effect, therefore reducing sensitivity. We tested only male participants, as more males than females play VVGs regularly ( ;  ;  ). Moreover, males have been shown to be more easily influenced by violent media ( ;  ). To further increase homogeneity of the sample, we restricted the age range of possible participants to 18\u201335 years. Additional inclusion criteria were no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders or drug abuse, and standard inclusion criteria for MRI measurements. Participants were recruited through online advertisements and received a financial compensation of \u20ac145 for participating in all experimental sessions. A performance-linked bonus of up to \u20ac35 acted as an additional incentive during the game sessions. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna (decision number 1258/2017). The confederate depicted in   has given informed consent that his photograph may be used for this publication. \n\n\n### Overall study design \n  \nParticipants were randomly assigned to the violent game group or the control game group. Participants first completed a pretest fMRI session, during which they performed an experimental task designed to measure empathy for pain. Then, over the course of 2 weeks, participants of the violent game group repeatedly played a VVG, while the control game group played a non-violent version of the same game. Subsequently, both groups completed the posttest fMRI session. Here, participants performed the empathy-for-pain paradigm again, and also completed a task designed to measure emotional reactivity to violent pictures. \n\n\n### Experimental fMRI sessions \n  \n#### Confederate \n  \nTo facilitate empathic responses during the experimental tasks, participants completed the experimental session together with a male confederate. The confederate acted as if he were a second participant of the experiment. This deception was maintained until the end of the last experimental session, at which point participants were debriefed. \n\n\n#### Pain calibration \n  \nThe empathy-for-pain paradigm included the administration of painful but tolerable stimuli. The physical pain was induced via a well-established procedure (e.g.  ). Electrical stimuli were produced by a Digitimer DS5 stimulator (Digitimer Ltd, Clinical & Biomedical Research Instruments, United Kingdom) and delivered by electrodes placed on the dorsum of the left hand. Subjective pain thresholds were determined using a standardized calibration procedure. The participant received short (500 ms) stimuli of increasing intensity and was asked to rate pain intensity on a numeric scale (0 = \u2018not perceptible\u2019; 1 = \u2018perceptible, but not painful\u2019, 3 = \u2018a little painful\u2019, 5 = \u2018moderately painful\u2019, 7 = \u2018very painful\u2019, 9 = \u2018extremely painful, highest tolerable pain\u2019). The average intensities of stimuli rated as 1 and 7 were then chosen as the intensities of the non-painful and painful stimulation conditions during the empathy-for-pain task. \n\n\n#### Empathy-for-pain paradigm \n  \nWe used a well-established paradigm to measure participants\u2019 empathic responses ( ;  ;  ;  ). Participants either received electric stimuli themselves (  Self   condition), or saw images of the confederate indicating that he was currently receiving electric stimulation (  Other   condition). The stimuli were either painful (  Pain   condition) or perceptible but not painful (  No Pain   condition). The timeline of the task is illustrated in  . At the start of each trial, a downwards or rightwards arrow (presented for 2 s) indicated whether the next stimulus would be delivered to the participant or the confederate, respectively (Cue phase). Red and blue arrows indicated painful and non-painful stimulation, respectively. After a jittered interval [3\u20137 s], the stimulus was delivered (Stimulation phase). In the Self condition, the participant received the electrical stimulus (0.5 s), and saw a pixelated photograph (1 s). In the Other condition, the participant saw a photograph of the confederate with a neutral or painful facial expression. After half of the trials, participants rated the last stimulus on a 100-step visual analog scale (VAS). In the Self condition, participants rated how painful the last stimulus was for themselves. In the Other condition, participants rated how painful the stimulus was for the confederate (other-oriented painfulness rating), and how unpleasant it was for themselves to observe the confederate receiving the stimulus (self-oriented unpleasantness rating). In total, there were 64 trials, with 16 trials per condition (Self Pain, Self No Pain, Other Pain, Other No Pain). Conditions were presented in a pseudorandomized order. The task was presented using COGENT ( ), implemented in MATLAB 2017b (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, USA). The total task duration was approx. 20 min. \n\n\n#### Emotional reactivity paradigm \n  \nTo investigate emotional reactivity to violent images, we used an affective picture paradigm ( ;  ). Participants were shown pictures of either neutral or violent content (factor   Content  ). Additionally, the pictures depicted either real scenes, or scenes taken from the video game participants played during the gaming sessions (factor   Context  ). Real pictures were taken from the International Affective Pictures System (IAPS;  ). Game pictures were matched to IAPS pictures in terms of content, valence, and arousal (see Appendix 1). \n\nThe sequence of events of the task is illustrated in  . Each block consisted of five pictures of the same condition, presented for 3 s each, and with a short interval of 0.2 s between pictures. After a jittered interval [3\u20137 s] participants rated how unpleasant they felt on a 100-step VAS. In total, participants saw 16 blocks of pictures, with 4 blocks per condition (Neutral Real, Neutral Game, Violent Real, Violent Game). The task was presented using COGENT, and total task duration was approx. 5 min. To avoid that participants formed expectations about the purpose of the study early on, participants completed this task only in the second fMRI session. \n\n\n#### MRI data acquisition \n  \nMRI data were acquired with a 3T Siemens Skyra MRI system (Siemens Medical, Erlangen, Germany) and a 32-channel head coil. BOLD functional imaging was performed using a multiband-accelerated echoplanar imaging sequence with the following parameters: Echo time (TE): 34 ms; repetition time (TR): 1200 ms; flip angle: 66\u00b0; interleaved ascending acquisition; 52 axial slices coplanar to the connecting line between anterior and posterior commissure; multiband acceleration factor 4, resulting in 13 excitations per TR; field-of-view: 192\u00d7192\u00d7124.8 mm , matrix size: 96\u00d796, voxel size: 2\u00d72\u00d72 mm , interslice gap 0.4 mm. Structural images were acquired using a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence with the following parameters: TE = 2.43 ms; TR = 2300 ms; 208 sagittal slices; field-of-view: 256\u00d7256\u00d7166 mm ; voxel size: 0.8\u00d70.8\u00d70.8 mm . To correct functional images for inhomogeneities of the magnetic field, field map images were acquired using a double echo gradient echo sequence with the following parameters: TE1/TE2: 4.92/7.38 ms; TR = 400 ms; flip angle: 60\u00b0; 36 axial slices with the same orientation as the functional images; field-of-view: 220\u00d7220\u00d7138 mm ; matrix size: 128\u00d7128\u00d736; voxel size: 1.72\u00d71.72\u00d73.85 mm . \n\n\n\n### Gaming sessions \n  \nBetween the two fMRI sessions, participants came seven times to the laboratory to play a video game for 1 hr. Intervals between subsequent gaming sessions were approximately 24\u201348 hr, and the second fMRI session was completed at least 24 hr after the last gaming session. Participants of both groups played a modified version of the game   Grand Theft Auto V  . In the violent game group, participants controlled a male character equipped with a close-combat weapon, and were tasked to kill as many other characters as possible. Killing was graphically violent, as hitting a character was accompanied by the splattering of blood, realistic animations of injury, and screams. In the control game group, participants played a version of the game in which all violence was removed. The player character had no weapon, and could not hurt other characters in any way. They could also not be attacked by other characters, and there was no violence between non-player characters. In this condition, participants were tasked to take photographs of as many other characters as possible. In both groups, participants could also freely explore the world of the game. To incentivize a high number of violent or non-violent acts, each kill or photograph was rewarded with one point. For every two points, participants were paid out +0.01\u20ac at the end of the study. \n\nDue to the lack of other studies implementing a randomized experimental prospective design (except for  , published while data collection was already ongoing), there were no benchmarks for the amount and frequency of video game exposure for our study. We chose our regimen (seven 1-hourly sessions over 2 weeks) as we considered this a substantial yet still feasible amount of exposure. Number of sessions, playing time per session, and total playing time were considerably higher than in previous studies reporting VVG effects on empathy ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nIn this paper, we follow a Bayesian data analysis approach ( ), which allows clear assessments of the presence or absence of an effect of VVGs on empathy. Hypothesis tests were performed by means of the BF ( ). The BF represents how much more probable the observed data is under the alternative hypothesis compared to the null hypothesis. A well-established convention is to report a BF>3 as evidence for the alternative hypothesis, a BF<1/3 as evidence for the null hypothesis, and a BF in the interval [1/3, 3] as inconclusive evidence for either hypothesis ( ;  ). We formulated informed priors for all models to enable valid BF hypothesis tests ( ). To increase comparability with the results of previous papers, we also report analogous frequentist analyses in the Appendix 5. We registered the analysis plan of this study at  . \n\n#### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nTo test the effects of VVGs on behavioral measures of empathy for pain, we analyzed the VAS ratings obtained during the empathy-for-pain task with hierarchical Bayesian censored regression models. We used censored regression models to account for the fact that participants could give no ratings lower than 0, or higher than 100. Models were estimated using the R package   brms   ( ). We modeled fixed effects for the experimental factors   Group   (non-violent vs. violent gaming, coded as \u20131 and 1),   Time   (pre vs. post gaming sessions, coded as \u20131 and 1), and   Intensity   (non-painful vs. painful stimulation of the confederate, coded as \u20131 and 1), as well as all interactions between these factors. Additionally, we modeled per-subject random effects of   Time  ,   Intensity  , and these factors\u2019 interaction term. To further account for variations in how participants used the VAS rating scale, we modeled per-subject error variance terms. For further details about the model specification and prior formulation, see Appendix 2. \n\nWe used the same kind of model to test possible desensitizing effects of VVGs on emotional reactivity to violent images. Here, we modeled fixed effects for the experimental factors   Group   (non-violent vs. violent gaming, coded as \u20131 and 1),   Content   (neutral vs. violent, coded as \u20131 and 1), and   Context   (real vs. game, coded as \u20131 and 1). Additionally, we modeled per-subject random effects for   Content  ,   Context  , and their interaction, as well as per-subject error variances. \n\n\n#### MRI data preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing and analysis of fMRI data were performed using SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging,  ) implemented in MATLAB 2017b. Functional images were slice timed and referenced to the middle slice, realigned to the mean image, and unwarped using the acquired field map. The structural image was co-registered to the mean image of the realigned functional images using mutual information maximization, and structural and functional images were normalized to the stereotactic Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The normalized functional images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 4 mm full-width-at-half-maximum, which is equal to twice the voxel size on every axis. To remove motion-related artifacts, the functional images were then subjected to an independent-component-analysis based algorithm for automatic removal of motion artifacts ( ;  ), implemented using the FMRIB software library (FSL v5.0;  ). \n\n\n#### fMRI analyses: empathy for pain \n  \nWith regard to empathy, our central interest lay in modulations of AI and ACC activity. To identify the regions in which empathic responses were reliably elicited independently of our experimental manipulation, we first analyzed the data from the first experimental session. We performed GLM-based whole-brain analysis using SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging,  ), implemented in MATLAB 2017b. For each participant, the design matrix included regressors for the Cue and Stimulation events, separate for all four combinations of conditions (Self No Pain; Self Pain; Other No Pain; Other Pain). As nuisance regressors, we included regressors for the rating events. We then subjected the beta images of the first-level contrast   Other Pain>Other No Pain   to a one-sample   t  -test, and identified the voxels in which this contrast was significant and positive (p<0.05 after family-wise error correction). From this, we obtained a binary mask of significant voxels. We then intersected this mask with anatomical masks taken from the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas (AAL;  ). For the AI ROI, the binary mask was intersected with the AAL mask of the insula (label IN). For the aMCC ROI, the binary mask was intersected with the AAL masks of the anterior and median cingulate and paracingulate gyri (labels ACIN and MCIN). The aim of this masking procedure was to restrict analyses to those parts of the brain areas that are actually recruited by the task. We believe that this increases the sensitivity of our analyses, as we remove signals from voxels that are also part of these anatomical regions, but not actually recruited by the task. \n\nWe analyzed signal changes extracted from our ROIs with Bayesian linear mixed effects model tailored for fMRI data. Note that the ROIs, which were based on the signal from only the first session, were used to extract signals from both sessions. Custom code for this analysis with the software STAN ( ) can be found at  . See also the Appendix 2 for more information. The full model included regressors for the Cue and Stimulation events, as well as nuisance regressors for rating events. \n\n\n#### fMRI analyses: emotional desensitization \n  \nWhen testing the effects of VVGs on brain activity during the emotional-reactivity task, our main interest lay in a possible modulation of responses in the amygdala, as well as aMCC and AI. To define the corresponding ROIs, we first identified the brain areas that were reliably activated by violent imagery, independent of the experimental manipulation, using whole-brain GLM analysis. For each participant, the design matrix included regressors for the blocks of picture presentations, separate for all four combinations of conditions (Neutral Real, Neutral Game, Violent Real, Violent Game). As nuisance regressors, we included regressors for the rating events. We then pooled the beta images of the first-level contrast   Violent>Neutral   across both groups, and subjected them to a one-sample   t  -test. From this, we obtained a binary mask of voxels significant at p<0.05 after family-wise error correction. We then intersected this mask with AAL masks to obtain our final ROIs (for AI: label IN; for aMCC: labels ACIN and MCIN; for amygdala: label AMYG). We analyzed signal changes extracted from our ROIs with Bayesian linear mixed effects model. The full model included regressors for the blocks of picture presentation, as well as nuisance regressors for rating events. \n\n\n\n### Post hoc analyses \n  \n#### Sample comparability \n  \nDue to our preselection of young adult males with minimal prior VVG exposure, it appeared possible that our sample was drawn from a subpopulation with higher trait empathy than the general population. To test this potential limitation, we compared the trait empathy levels of our sample, as measured by the QCAE ( ), to those of a control sample of 18- to 35-year-old males who were not preselected for minimal VVG use. The control sample was taken from the dataset of  , which is freely accessible online ( ). We chose this open dataset because we deemed it highly comparable to our own sample, having also been drawn from the Austrian population, by researchers of the same university. To test whether our sample exhibited higher trait empathy levels than the control sample, we calculated a one-sided Bayesian   t  -test for each of the five subdimensions of the QCAE, using the R package BayesFactor ( ). \n\n\n#### Test-retest reliabilities \n  \nGiven that our experimental design included measurements of participants\u2019 empathic responses in two sessions (once before playing the VVG or the control game, once after), the test-retest reliability   \u03c1   of these two measurements was of interest. \n\nIn our behavioral data, the empathic response in one session was given by the average difference in ratings for   Pain   trials minus   No Pain   trials in session 1 and 2. Given our estimated hierarchical Bayesian censored regression models, the test-retest reliability of empathic responses can be estimated as \n\nwhere   Cov   and   Var   are the Covariance and Variance, respectively,   is the random effect of the factor   Intensity   (Pain vs. No Pain), and   is the random effect of the interaction of factors   Intensity   and   Session  . By the bilinearity of the covariance operator, this formula can be written in terms of estimated model parameters as \n\nwhere   and   are the variances of the random effect of   Intensity   and   Intensity:Session  , respectively, and where   is the correlation between these two random effects. \n\nIn our neural data, we defined the empathic response in one session as the average difference in BOLD signal to observing the other in pain vs. observing the other in no pain. Given our estimated hierarchical Bayesian regression model, the test-retest reliability of the neural response was given by the correlation coefficient between the random effect for the regressor   Stimulus Other: Pain \u2013 No Pain   in Session 1 and the random effect for the equivalent regressor in Session 2. \n\n\n#### Bayesian design analysis \n  \nWe based our sample size on the results of a power analysis designed for the frequentist inference framework (see section Methods: Power analysis). However, as we ultimately based our inference on BF tests, the theoretical long-term behavior of these tests, given our sample size and expected effect size, is of interest. Therefore, we conducted a post hoc BF design analysis by means of a Monte Carlo simulation experiment ( ). \n\nThe analysis was performed using the R package   BayesFactor   ( ). We simulated data from the scenario in which there was no VVG effect on the outcome variable (H0; Cohen\u2019s   d  =0), as well as from three scenarios where there was a true VVG effect (H1). Here, we considered three different effect sizes:   d  =0.4, which is close to the effect size estimate of  ; the exact estimate was (  d  =0.394);   d  =0.3, which is the effect size we used in our power analysis; and   d  =0.2, the conventional threshold for small effects. \n\nFor each scenario/effect size, we randomly generated 10,000 datasets of the same size as our real sample (control group = 44 participants; experimental group = 45 participants) and subjected them to BF hypothesis tests, assessing whether the BF provided evidence for the alternative hypothesis (BF>3), for the null hypothesis (BF<1/3), or inconclusive evidence (1/3<BF<3). For the behavioral and neural empathy measures, which were measured in two sessions (once before playing the VVG or the control game, once after), we used test-retest-reliability estimates that are close to those from the previous section. \n\n\n#### Cross-task correlations \n  \nWe additionally report the empirical correlations between the behavioral and neural measurements of our participants empathic response in the empathy-for-pain task, and their response in the emotional reactivity task. As indicators of participants\u2019 behavioral responses, we used their estimated random effects from the Bayesian hierarchical models on their rating data (for Empathy for Pain: factor   Intensity  , i.e. Pain vs. No Pain; for Emotional Reactivity: factor   Context,   i.e. Violent vs. Neutral). As indicators of participants\u2019 neural responses, we used their estimated random effects from the Bayesian models on signals extracted from the ROIs (for Empathy for Pain: regressor   Stimulus Other: Pain \u2013 No Pain;   for Emotional Reactivity: regressor   Violent \u2013 Neutral  ). \n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10791126, "text_md5": "484ef8f7c456c954d432df0419ee5dd8", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 170], "journal": [171, 176], "publication_year": [178, 182], "title": [193, 342], "keywords": [356, 432], "abstract": [445, 3980], "body": [3989, 64449]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 37975654, "doi": "10.7554/eLife.84951", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10791126", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10791126"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10791126\">10791126</a>", "list_title": "PMC10791126  Neuroimaging and behavioral evidence that violent video games exert no negative effect on human empathy for pain and emotional reactivity to violence"}

However, the neural bases of these sex differences remain under-investigated. Here, by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a variant of the Monetary Incentive Delay Task (MIDT), we examined sex differences in the neural responses to wins and losses and how individual reward and punishment sensitivity modulates these regional activities. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThirty-sex men and 27 women participated in the fMRI study. We assessed sensitivity to punishment (SP) and sensitivity to reward (SR) with the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ). In the MIDT, participants pressed a button to collect reward ($1, 1\u00a2, or nil), with the reaction time window titrated across trials so participants achieved a success rate of approximately 67%. We processed the Imaging data with published routines and evaluated the results with a corrected threshold. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWomen showed higher SP score than men and men showed higher SR score than women. Men relative to women showed higher response to the receipt of dollar or cent reward in bilateral orbitofrontal and visual cortex. Men as compared to women also showed higher response to dollar loss in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex. Further, in whole-brain regressions, women relative to men demonstrated more significant modulation by SP in the neural responses to wins and larger wins, and the sex differences were confirmed by slope tests. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nTogether, men showed higher SR and neural sensitivity to both wins, large or small, and losses than women. Individual differences in SP were associated with diminished neural responses to wins and larger wins in women only. These findings highlight how men and women may differ in reward-related brain activations in the MIDT and add to the imaging literature of sex differences in cognitive and affective functions. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \n### Reward processing in health and illness \n  \nReward-directed behavior is fundamental to survival and well-being [ ]. We strive to obtain primary (food, water, sex) and secondary (money, social approval) rewards [ ,  ]. Reward-seeking behavior engages neural circuits central to motivation and learning [ ,  ]. Numerous studies have identified the ventral tegmental area, ventral striatum (VS), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and anterior cingulate cortex as key regions for reward processing [ \u2013 ]. These structures integrate motivational and cognitive processes to support reward-seeking behavior [ ,  ,  ]. Further, individuals vary in how they respond to reward-related contingencies [ ], and men appear to be more sensitive to reward whereas women are more sensitive to punishment [ ,  ]. \n\nMany neuropsychiatric conditions implicate motivation deficits and reward processing dysfunction. For instance, anhedonia and compulsive drug seeking represent core symptoms of major depression and substance use disorders (SUDs), respectively, and implicate dysfunction of the reward circuitry [ ,  ]. Studies have consistently found reduced striatal response to reward anticipation and feedback [ ] and impaired learning of reward contingencies [ ] in patients with depression. The neural deficits correlate positively with anhedonia and negatively with treatment outcome [ ,  ,  ]. Chronic pain is frequently comorbid with depression and associated with deficits in reward responses [ ]. Substance misuse alters the salience of natural reinforcers and compromises self-control of immediate gratification, perpetuating drug seeking [ ,  \u2013 ]. Adolescents exposed prenatally to maternal cigarette smoking are observed to have a weaker bilateral VS response to reward anticipation [ ]. Importantly, many of these neuropsychiatric conditions demonstrate sex differences in their clinical profiles and etiological processes, with, for instance, women more vulnerable to depression and men to SUDs. Thus, it is important to better understand how men and women process reward differently. \n\n\n### Sex differences in reward and punishment processing \n  \nBiological, including hormonal, and socio-cultural factors may all account for sex differences in reward sensitivity and reward-directed behavior [ ,  ]. Indeed, the literature is mixed regarding sex differences in reward-related behavior and the neural processes underlying such differences. For example, some studies showed that women relative to men were better at delaying gratification [ ,  ], but others showed no sex differences [ ]. A study in rodents reported no sex difference in reward-guided associative learning across multiple paradigms. However, females appeared to be faster in learning to avoid punishment and, after learning, exhibited higher sensitivity than males to probabilistic punishment but less sensitive when punishment could be avoided with certainty [ ]. Women compared to men tended to pick decks with lower frequency of punishment on a gambling task [ ]. In a study combining electroencephalography (EEG) and a guessing task with both reward and punishment feedback, boys showed lower feedback-related negativity (FRN) and less behavioral changes following punishment [ ]. Further, girls but not boys demonstrated FRN to punishment in correlation with a reward sensitivity trait. In another EEG study of an incentive delay task, boys relative to girls showed less stimulus-preceding negativity in anticipation of punishment and greater feedback P3 to monetary than social reward [ ]. These findings are consistent with a literature of higher female sensitivity to loss, punishment or other negative feedback [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nIn contrast, visual sexual stimuli activated the reward system in both sexes whereas the VS was involved in men but not women in supporting the distractor effects of the stimuli on line orientation judgment [ ]. Adolescent boys relative to girls showed greater VS activation during reward processing in a risky decision making task, made a higher percentage of risky selections, and self-reported greater motivation to earn money than girls [ ]. Studying the perceived value of monetary vs. social rewards using a monetary/social incentive delay task, another group reported activation of a wider mesolimbic network in response to anticipation of monetary reward in men and in anticipation of both monetary and social reward in women, in accord with their reaction time performance [ ]. In a recent work of a reward go/no-go task, men exhibited greater arousal in response to \u201cgo\u201d action (predominating monetary wins), and the arousal better predicted go success rate, as compared to women [ ]. On the other hand, women were better than men in learning from positive (but not negative) feedback in a probabilistic selection task [ ]. In another study of the Human Connectome Project data, women relative to men showed more suppression of the default mode circuit and higher activation of the dorsal attention circuit during exposure to both reward and punishment, suggesting enhanced saliency of both reward and punishment in women [ ]. Thus, sex differences in reward-related processing appear to depend on the nature of rewarding stimuli and behavioral contingency. \n\n\n### The effects of reward and punishment sensitivity on reward-related processing \n  \nIn addition to sex, individuals may also vary in reward-related behavioral and neural processes because of distinct reward and punishment sensitivity. Sensitivity to reward scores correlated positively with reactivity to erotic pictures in the left OFC, left insula, and right VS [ ]. In a study of reinforcement learning, individual differences in reward sensitivity were positively associated with bilateral VS activation during receipt of reward, while differences in punishment sensitivity were negatively associated with left dorsal striatal activity during loss anticipation and with right lateral OFC activation during loss feedback [ ]. Another study examined three groups of people, each with low, medium, and high reward sensitivity, in a working memory task with sub- and supra-liminal stimuli. Individuals with medium reward sensitivity improved performance with high reward in both subliminal and supraliminal conditions, whereas the effect of reward was stronger in the supraliminal than subliminal condition for those with high reward sensitivity scores [ ]. The latter findings highlighted complex effects of individual reward sensitivity on cognitive performance incentivized by monetary reward. Investigators have also associated sensitivity to punishment with higher insula activity during feedback of social loss in a social incentive delay task in people with subthreshold depression [ ]. On the other hand, despite its wide use in the imaging literature, no studies of the monetary incentive delay task (MIDT) have examined how neural responses to monetary wins or losses may vary with individual sensitivity to reward or to punishment. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Aim, design and setting of the study \n  \nThe present study aims to characterize sex differences in cerebral responses to reward anticipation and feedback and whether women and men differ in the influences of individual reward and punishment sensitivity on these neural processes. On the basis of the literature, we broadly hypothesized higher SR in men relative to women and reward circuit responses in correlation with SR in both men and women. We would also explore how SP modulated neural response to wins and losses and potential sex differences in SP modulation. To these ends we contrasted men and women in regional responses to reward anticipation and feedback in neurotypical populations. We performed linear regression to identify how these regional responses may vary according to individual SR and SP and examined the sex differences in these correlations with slope tests. Understanding sex differences in reward processing would provide information for translational studies to examine sex-specific neural markers of clinical conditions that implicate reward processing dysfunction. \n\n\n### Subjects and assessments \n  \nSixty-three healthy adults (27 women; 22\u201355 or 37\u2009\u00b1\u200911, mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, years of age) participated in this study. All subjects were healthy with no current use of prescription medications. None reported a history of head injury or neurological illness. Other exclusion criteria included current or past Axis I Disorders including dependence on a psychoactive substance, according to DSM-IV. All participants were evaluated with the Sensitivity to Reward and Sensitivity to Punishment Questionnaire (SPSRQ) [ ]. The SPSRQ contains 48 yes\u2013no items, half concerning the scale for behavioral impulsivity/responsiveness to reward and half concerning the scale for behavioral avoidance in response to potentially adverse consequences. Scores were obtained by totaling the number of yes-answers in each scale, with a higher sub-score each indicating higher sensitivity to reward (SR) and sensitivity to punishment (SP). Table   summarizes subject characteristics.   \nSubject characteristics \n  \n SR   sensitivity to reward,   SP   sensitivity to punishment \n\np\u2009<\u20090.05, two-sample t test \n  \n\nThe Human Investigation Committee at Yale University School of Medicine approved the study and all subjects gave written informed consent prior to participation. \n\n\n### Monetary incentive delay task (MIDT) \n  \nIn the MIDT (Fig.\u00a0 a), a bet (a dollar, a cent, or no money, randomly intermixed) appeared on the screen at the beginning of each trial. After a randomized fore-period between 1 and 5\u00a0s (uniform distribution), a target box was shown for a short period (response window, see below). Subjects were told to press a button as quickly as possible to collect the money (win) before the target box disappeared. An accurate trial was defined by a button press before disappearance of the target box. Otherwise, subjects would lose the bet, with the amount deducted from the total win. A premature button press prior to the appearance of the target box terminated the trial, and similarly resulted in loss. Feedback was shown on the screen after each trial to indicate the amount of money won or lost. Approximately 42% of all trials were dollar trials, 42% were cent trials, and \u201cno money\u201d constituted the remaining trials. The inter-trial-interval was 1.5\u00a0s. The response window started at 300\u00a0ms, and was stair-cased for each trial type (dollar/cent/no money) separately; for instance, if the subject succeeded at two successive dollar trials, the window decreased by 30\u00a0ms, making it more difficult to win again; conversely, if a subject failed for two successive trials, the response window increased by 30\u00a0ms, making it easier to win. We anticipated that the subjects would win in approximately 67% each for dollar and cent trials. Each subject completed two 10-min runs of the task. Across subjects, there were 184\u2009\u00b1\u20094 (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) trials in a study.   \nBehavioral paradigm and performance. a Monetary incentive delay task: A bet (a dollar, a cent, or no money) appeared at the beginning of each trial. After a randomized interval between 1 and 5\u00a0s, a target box appeared on the screen, then disappeared after a short period (response window). Subjects were told to press a button as quickly as possible to collect the money in the target box (win) before it disappeared. Otherwise, subjects lost the bet, with the amount deducted from their total winnings. A premature button-press prior to the appearance of the target box terminated the trial, and similarly resulted in loss. A feedback window was shown on the screen after each trial to indicate the amount of money won or lost. b Accuracy rate and c RT of dollar, cent and no money (nil) trials (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) for men and women \n  \n\n\n### Imaging protocol, data preprocessing, and modeling \n  \nBrain images were collected using multiband imaging with a 3-T MR scanner (Siemens Trio, Erlangen, Germany). Conventional T1-weighted spin echo sagittal anatomical images were acquired for slice localization. Anatomical 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) image were next obtained with spin echo imaging in the axial plane parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC\u2013PC) line with repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20091900\u00a0ms, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20092.52\u00a0ms, bandwidth\u2009=\u2009170\u00a0Hz/pixel, field of view\u2009=\u2009250\u2009\u00d7\u2009250\u00a0mm, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, 176 slices with slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u00a0mm and no gap. Functional, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals were then acquired with a single-shot gradient echo echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence. Fifty-one axial slices parallel to the AC\u2013PC line covering the whole brain were acquired with TR\u2009=\u20091000\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u200930\u00a0ms, bandwidth\u2009=\u20092290\u00a0Hz/pixel, flip angle\u2009=\u200962\u00b0, field of view\u2009=\u2009210\u2009\u00d7\u2009210\u00a0mm, matrix\u2009=\u200984\u2009\u00d7\u200984, 51 slices with slice thickness\u2009=\u20092.5\u00a0mm and no gap, multiband acceleration factor\u2009=\u20093. \n\nData were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8). Individual subjects\u2019 images were corrected for motion and slice timing. A mean functional image volume was constructed for individual subjects per run from the realigned image volumes, co-registered with the high-resolution structural image, and segmented for normalization with affine registration followed by nonlinear transformation [ ,  ]. The normalization parameters determined for the structure volume were applied to the corresponding functional volumes for individual subjects. The images were then smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8\u00a0mm at Full Width at Half Maximum. \n\nWe examined event-related BOLD signals in a general linear model, where we distinguished the cue onset of dollar, cent, and \u201cno money\u201d or nil trials, and the feedback onset of dollar win, dollar loss, cent win, cent loss, and nil. A statistical analytical design was constructed for each individual subject, with the onsets of individual trials convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and with the temporal derivatives of the canonical HRF and entered as regressors in the model [ ]. Realignment parameters in all six dimensions were also entered in the model. Serial autocorrelation caused by aliased cardiovascular and respiratory effects was corrected by a first-degree autoregressive model. The GLM estimated the component of variance explained by each of the regressors. \n\nIn group level or random effects analyses, we employed one-sample t tests to examine whole-brain responses to individual contrasts (see below) in men and women combined and two-sample t tests to examine sex differences in these contrasts with age and RT differences, as specified by the contrasts, as covariates. To investigate the neural correlates of SR and SP, we conducted whole-brain linear regressions of these contrasts on SR and SP, with age and RT differences, as specified by the contrasts, as covariates for men and women combined as well as separately. For sex-specific findings, we defined the functional clusters identified from linear regressions in men and women alone as regions of interest, extracted the \u03b2 estimates for all subjects, and performed slope tests to examine sex differences in the correlations [ ]. Note that the slope test for sex difference does not represent \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d or circular analysis, as the slope tests may confirm or refute sex differences [ ,  ]. \n\nAll models were evaluated with a threshold combining voxel p\u2009<\u20090.001, uncorrected and cluster p\u2009<\u20090.05 family-wise error (FWE) corrected, following current reporting standards. Voxels with peak activity were indicated with Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates. We have also deposited the unthresholded maps of all contrasts on Neurovalut ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral performance \n  \nFigure\u00a0 b, c show the accuracy rate (AR) and reaction time (RT) of dollar, cent, and nil trials. For both men and women, the ARs were close to 67%, suggesting the success of the staircase procedure. For men, the AR ranged from 40 to 71% for dollar, 41 to 71% for cent, and 41 to 70% for nil trials. For women, the AR ranged from 55 to 71% for dollar, 43 to 69% for cent and 49 to 69% for nil trials. There were no significant sex differences in the AR of dollar (t \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.76; p\u2009=\u20090.45), cent (t \u2009= \u2009\u2212\u00a00.37; p\u2009=\u20090.70), or nil (t \u2009=\u2009 \u2212\u00a00.73; p\u2009=\u20090.47) trials or in the RT of dollar (t \u2009=\u20090.05; p\u2009=\u20090.96), cent (t \u2009= \u2009\u2212\u00a00.04; p\u2009=\u20090.97), or nil (t \u2009=\u20090.04; p\u2009=\u20090.97) trials. \n\nMen showed higher sensitivity to reward (SR) score than women, and, in contrast, women showed higher sensitivity to punishment (SP) score than men (Table  ). We examined the relationship between behavioral performance and SR and SP for men and women together and separately. In linear regressions, SR score was positively correlated with the AR of dollar trials in men\u2009+\u2009women (r \u2009=\u20090.28, p\u2009=\u20090.02) and in women (r \u2009=\u20090.52, p\u2009=\u20090.006). SR score was also positively correlated with the AR of cent trials in men\u2009+\u2009women (r \u2009=\u20090.33, p\u2009=\u20090.008) and in women (r \u2009=\u20090.51, p\u2009=\u20090.007). SR score was negatively correlated with the RT of cent trials in women (r \u2009=\u2009 \u2212\u00a00.44, p\u2009=\u20090.02), SP score was positively correlated with the RT of dollar trials in women (r \u2009=\u20090.50, p\u2009=\u20090.007), and SP was positively correlated with the RT of cent trials in men\u2009+\u2009women (r \u2009=\u20090.28, p\u2009=\u20090.03) (Fig.\u00a0 ). The r and p values of all correlations are shown in Table  . However, although women appeared to show more significant correlations between SR/SP scores and performance measures, relative to men, the slope tests did not reveal significant sex differences in any of these correlations (all p\u2019s\u2009\u2265\u20090.47).   \nLinear regressions between SPSRQ scores for men, women, and all, for accuracy rate (AR) and RT of dollar and cent trials \n    \nLinear regressions between performance measures and SR/SP \n  \nAccuracy rate (AR, %) and reaction time (RT, ms) and sensitivity to reward (SR) and sensitivity to punishment (SP) scores for men and women combined (M\u2009+\u2009F), men (M), and women (F). *p\u2009<\u20090.05.

Anticipation of a dollar reward involved activation of the medial visual cortical areas, including the cuneus, dorsal striatum, supplementary motor areas, thalamus, and cerebellum. In contrast, anticipation of a cent reward involved \u201cdeactivation\u201d of a large swath of medial and lateral visual cortical areas, bilateral inferior frontal cortex, and cerebellum. In a covariance analysis with age and RT differences as covariates, men and women did not show significant differences in activation to reward anticipation during dollar vs. nil, cent vs. nil, or dollar vs. cent trials.   \nRegional activations during anticipation to win a dollar vs. nil; b cent vs. nil; and c dollar vs. cent. Clusters showing greater response to dollar\u2009>\u2009nil and nil\u2009>\u2009dollar, etc., are shown in warm and cool colors, respectively. Color bars indicate voxel T value.

Neurological orientation: right is right \n  \n\n\n### Sex differences in regional activations to feedback (win or loss) \n  \nIn a one-sample t-test, we evaluated regional activations to dollar win vs. nil, cent win vs. nil, dollar vs. cent win, dollar loss vs. nil, cent loss vs. nil, and dollar vs. cent loss in men and women combined. These results are shown in Fig.\u00a0 . Both dollar and cent wins engaged higher activation of the ventral striatum (VS) and visual cortical areas. Dollar wins engaged additional brain regions, including the medial orbitofrontal cortex, caudate nucleus and the cerebellum. In contrast, both dollar and cent losses engaged higher activation of bilateral anterior insula and medial frontal cortex, including the anterior cingulate gyrus, and left somatomotor cortex.   \nRegional activations to outcomes: a dollar win vs. nil; b cent win vs. nil; c dollar vs. cent win; d dollar loss vs. nil; e cent loss vs. nil; and f dollar vs. cent loss.

Voxel p\u2009<\u20090.001, uncorrected. Neurological orientation: right is right \n  \n\nIn covariance analyses to compare men and women with age and RT differences as covariates for each of these contrasts, we observed sex differences in activation (men\u2009>\u2009women) in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and occipital cortex for dollar win\u2009>\u2009nil (Fig.\u00a0 a), and in the left frontal/temporal Rolandic operculum for cent win\u2009>\u2009nil (Fig.\u00a0 b). Compared to women, men also showed higher activation to dollar loss\u2009>\u2009nil in similar areas of the bilateral OFC and to cent loss\u2009>\u2009nil in the right precentral gyrus. Clusters meeting cluster p\u2009<\u20090.05 FWE are summarized in Table  . None of the other contrasts, including dollar win vs. dollar loss and cent win vs. cent loss (not shown in the figure), showed significant sex differences.   \nCovariance analyses of men vs. women, with age and RT differences (as specified by the contrast) as covariates, of a dollar win vs. nil, b cent win vs. nil, c dollar win vs. cent win, d dollar loss vs. nil, e cent loss vs. nil, f dollar loss vs. cent loss.

None of the regressions revealed significant findings in men and women combined or alone. \n\nLikewise, we examined how regional responses to feedbacks varied with individual differences in SR and SP. For each of the six contrasts, we performed a linear regression with both SR and SP scores as regressors and years of age and RT difference, as specified by the contrast, as covariates for men and women combined as well as separately. In men alone, the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (PCC/PCu) showed activation to dollar win vs. nil in positive correlation with SR score. In women alone, right middle frontal and postcentral gyri showed activation to dollar win vs. nil in negative correlation with SP score. Women also showed activation to dollar vs. cent win in the right anterior insula, left superior frontal gyrus and right temporal gyrus in negative correlation with SP score. These clusters are shown in Fig.\u00a0 . Some of these regional activities were also observed in men and women combined. These clusters are summarized in Table  .   \nSex differences in the regression of regional activities with SR/SP scores. The statistics are summarized in the main text. a \u03b2 contrast \u201cdollar win vs. nil\u201d of the PCC/PCu was positively correlated with SR score in men but not in women; however, the slope test failed to confirm the sex difference (z\u2009=\u20091.88, p\u2009=\u20090.06). b The \u03b2 contrast \u201cdollar win vs. nil\u201d of the right middle frontal and postcentral gyri was negatively correlated with the SP score in women but not in men, and the slope test confirmed the sex difference in the correlation (z\u2009=\u20093.33, p\u2009=\u20090.0009). c The \u03b2 contrast \u201cdollar vs. cent win\u201d of the right anterior insula and temporal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with the SP score in women but not in men, and the slope test confirmed the sex difference (z\u2009=\u20094.46, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) \n    \nRegression analysis with SP and SR score \n  \nVoxel   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 uncorrected; cluster p\u2009<\u20090.05 FWE; R: right; L: left; G: gyrus; PCC: posterior cingulate cortex; PCu: precuneus; IPL: inferior parietal lobule; dmPFC: dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; OFC: orbitofrontal cortex; SFG: superior frontal gyrus \n  \n\nTo examine sex differences, we performed slope tests [ ] on the six individual clusters with regional activities in correlation with the SR or SP score in men or women alone. The results for the individual clusters identified from the same contrast were statistically identical and thus these clusters were combined in slope tests. The results showed that the \u03b2 contrast \u201cdollar win vs. nil\u201d of the PCC/PCu was positively correlated with SR score in men (r \u2009=\u20090.665, p\u2009=\u20091.81e-05) but not in women (r \u2009=\u20090.277, p\u2009=\u20090.180); however, the slope test failed to confirm the sex difference (z\u2009=\u20091.88, p\u2009=\u20090.06). The \u03b2 contrast \u201cdollar win vs. nil\u201d of the right middle frontal and postcentral gyri was negatively correlated with the SP score in women (r \u2009= \u2009\u2212\u00a00.751, p\u2009=\u20091.53e\u221205) but not in men (r \u2009=\u2009 \u2009\u2212\u00a00.080, p\u2009=\u20090.653), and the slope test confirmed the sex difference in the correlation (z\u2009=\u20093.33, p\u2009=\u20090.0009). The \u03b2 contrast \u201cdollar vs. cent win\u201d of the right anterior insula and temporal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with the SP score in women (r \u2009=\u2009 \u2009\u2212\u00a00.847, p\u2009=\u20099.24e\u221208) but not in men (r \u2009=\u2009 \u2009\u2212\u00a00.024, p\u2009=\u20090.894), and the slope test confirmed the sex difference (z\u2009=\u20094.46, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The regressions for men and women together and separately are shown in Fig.\u00a0 . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe studied sex differences in reward processing in a sample of 63 healthy adults (27 women) using a variant monetary incentive delay task (MIDT). The volunteers made a timed response to win \u201cthe bet\u201d of $1, \u00a21, or nil. We examined how sex influenced behavioral performance and neural activation to monetary reward anticipation and feedback. Our results show that while there are no sex differences during reward anticipation, male sex is associated with higher activity to feedback of winning $1 (vs. nil) in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and visual cortex, as well as higher activity of losing $1 (vs. nil) in largely the same region of bilateral OFC. Men relative to women also showed higher activation in the left frontal/temporal Rolandic operculum during \u00a21 wins vs. nil. These results suggest that men have heightened neural sensitivity to receiving monetary reward of higher or lower magnitude than females and that both wins and losses of large reward were more salient for men, relative to women. As quantified by the SPSRQ, men showed higher sensitivity to reward (SR) and women showed higher sensitivity to punishment, in keeping with the literature [ ,  ,  ]. Further, women showed more significant modulation by individual SP in the neural responses to wins and larger wins. We highlight the main findings in the discussion below. \n\n### Lack of sex differences in response to reward anticipation \n  \nOur results showed that there were no significant sex differences in neural activation to reward anticipation. Reward anticipation is central to associative learning, and this finding is broadly consistent with animal behavioral studies reporting no sex differences in reward guided associative learning in male and female rodents [ ]. In human imaging literature, both men and women have been found to activate a wide neural network to anticipation of monetary reward [ ]. Similarly enhanced activation in the VS, ventral tegmental area, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex was observed in both sexes in anticipation of smiling faces of the opposite sex [ ]. No sex differences were found in activation of the reward circuits during anticipation of sexually explicit materials [ \u2013 ]. However, one study showed increased activation in men vs. women of the ventral putamen during reward anticipation in a gambling task. This same study found that women\u2019s reward circuit was more reactive to anticipation of uncertain reward during the mid-follicular, when estrogen levels are high, than luteal menstrual phase [ ]. Thus, our findings need to be interpreted with caution because of a limited sample size and lack of control of menstrual phase in female participants. It is also likely that sex differences or the lack thereof in regional responses to reward anticipation may depend on the behavioral contingencies; i.e., whether the motor decision involves learning or simply guessing or a speedy response to acquire the reward. \n\n\n### Sex differences in response to feedback and reward/punishment sensitivity \n  \nBehaviorally, while men and women each showed higher SR and SP score, in accord with earlier reports using the SPSRQ [ ,  ], SP and SR score appeared to influence task performance in both sexes. However, men and women differed in regional responses to reward. Relative to women, men engaged bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and visual cortex to a greater extent in response to dollar win vs. nil and the same regions in bilateral OFC in response to dollar loss vs. nil. Men relative to women also showed higher activity in the left frontal/temporal Rolandic operculum to cent win vs. nil. The OFC is involved in learning and optimal decision-making [ ], encoding motivational salience of stimuli to support approach behavior [ ,  ], and integrating stimulus attributes and emotional value [ \u2013 ]. As part of the association cortex, the frontal/temporal Rolandic operculum is implicated in thought, planning and learning of reward contingencies [ \u2013 ]. Thus, these findings suggest greater male sensitivity to monetary reward, in accord with the literature. For instance, an event-related potential study in adolescents reported higher feedback P3 amplitude in boys, as compared to girls, in response to monetary rewards [ ]. Another study reported a preferential response of the OFC to attractive vs. unattractive faces in men but not in women [ ]. \n\nWomen showed regional responses to wins and larger wins in negative correlation with SP. These areas include the right middle frontal gyrus and anterior insula, each part of the ventral attention and salience networks [ ,  ]. In contrast, these regional responses were not correlated with SP scores in men and the responses of these same regions to losses did not correlate significantly with SP scores in women. Thus, higher neural sensitivity to wins appears to be a marker of individual variation in SP in women. Conversely, although falling short of statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.06), men seem to demonstrate higher neural sensitivities to wins in relation to SR scores. Thus, reward-related neural responses and behavior may be modulated by distinct personality traits across the two sexes. \n\nIn our previous study of the MIDT task, activation of the right caudate head, along with the SMA and right anterior insula during reward anticipation, was correlated with diminished differences in RT collecting a large vs. small reward, suggesting its role in reward-based cognitive motor control [ ]. Although one would expect individual SR or SP may be reflected in behavioral performance, we did not observe a significant correlation between the trait and any performance measures in men and women combined or examined separately. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to revisit this issue. \n\n\n### Limitations and additional considerations \n  \nA number of limitations need to be considered for the study. First, we did not record the menstrual phase of women, which may have introduced variance to influence the current findings. Second, we did not study sex-based variation in general incentive salience. Men relative to women are more motivated by monetary reward; however, the current findings cannot be generalized to other (e.g., social) rewards or behavioral contingencies. Third, the sample size is relatively small to address sex differences. Thus, these findings should be considered preliminary. Finally, the current MIDT variant did not explicitly distinguish sessions where participants were expected to win vs. to lose. Thus, although it is reasonable that participants would expect to win in general (~\u200967%) and anticipation did involve regional activities typically implicated in the MIDT, we had no way to evaluate the trial-by-trial variation in the extent participants expected to win or to lose. It is perhaps also for this reason that we did not observe sex differences in anticipation-related activities or an impact of SR and SP traits on these activities. Again, these \u201cnegative\u201d results would need to be revaluated with a larger sample and paradigms that instruct anticipation to win vs. lose. \n\nA few additional issues are worth considering. We did not observe a similar pattern of responses (but of different magnitude) to anticipation of dollar and cent wins. In fact, the occipital cortex showed diametric responses between anticipation of dollar and cent wins, suggesting an effect of relativity\u2014large and small reward may not engage the same circuit in a linear fashion. Further, women appear to be more loss aversive than men [ ], and it remains to be seen to what extent loss aversion can be captured by punishment sensitivity and how sex differences in loss aversion may account for the current findings. More studies\u00a0with multiple behavioral paradigms [ ] are warranted to investigate these issues. \n\n\n### Perspectives and significance \n  \nMen and women differ in trait and neural sensitivity to reward and punishment. The literature nearly consistently finds men to be more sensitive than women to monetary reward. These heightened neural responses to monetary feedback involve the cognitive motor circuits, including the SMA and caudate nucleus, and would likely influence a wide range of reward-related behavior. The sex differences in reward and punishment sensitivity may have a greater impact on neural activation to reward processing and reward-related decision making than we were able to demonstrate with the data collected of the MIDT. It remains to be seen whether or how these behavioral and neural sensitivity manifest in other laboratory paradigms and real-life decision making. Further, it is unclear how genetic and sociocultural factors may contribute to the sex differences. Sex differences in the incidence and phenomenology of neuropsychiatric and behavioral disturbances such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse are known to be directly related to reward saliency processing and reward-based learning. It would be of significant interest to public health whether a gender-free or gender-less upbringing, now an emerging trend in child rearing, may alter the picture of sex differences in reward processing and in the susceptibility to neuropsychiatric illness that we find in our society today. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWe replicated higher male sensitivity to reward and female sensitivity to punishment as evaluated by the SPSRQ. Although these individual differences did not translate to influence behavioral performance in the MIDT, likely due to a small sample size, men and women exhibited differences in neural responses to reward. Men show higher SR and neural sensitivity to the receipt of reward, big or small, and to loss, as compared to women. Women showed higher SP than men and individual differences in SP are reflected in regional brain responses to wins and larger wins in women but not in men. These findings add to the imaging literature of sex and individual differences in reward processing. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7913329, "text_md5": "785e1c0ab9b475e24170246ed43c285c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 107], "journal": [108, 120], "publication_year": [122, 126], "title": [137, 249], "keywords": [263, 320], "abstract": [333, 2359], "body": [2368, 37975]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 33639845, "doi": "10.1186/s12868-021-00618-3", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7913329", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7913329"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7913329\">7913329</a>", "list_title": "PMC7913329  Sex differences in neural responses to reward and the influences of individual reward and punishment sensitivity"}

The semiotic framework of Peirce\u2019s Universal Categories (UCs) laid ground for a novel cognitive-semiotic typology of social interactions. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 16 volunteers watched a movie narrative encompassing verbal and non-verbal social interactions. Three types of non-verbal interactions were coded (\u201cunresolved,\u201d \u201cnon-habitual,\u201d and \u201chabitual\u201d) based on a typology reflecting Peirce\u2019s UCs. As expected, the auditory cortex responded to verbal interactions, but non-verbal interactions modulated temporal areas as well. Conceivably, when speech was lacking, ambiguous visual information (unresolved interactions) primed auditory processing in contrast to learned behavioral patterns (habitual interactions). The latter recruited a parahippocampal-occipital network supporting conceptual processing and associative memory retrieval. Requesting semiotic contextualization, non-habitual interactions activated visuo-spatial and contextual rule-learning areas such as the temporo-parietal junction and right lateral prefrontal cortex. In summary, the cognitive-semiotic typology reflected distinct sensory and association networks underlying the interpretation of observed non-verbal social interactions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDuring social interactions, a multitude of auditory and visual cues interact to convey meaning. These cues range from spoken words and manual gestures to facial expressions, eye gaze, body orientation, and body movements ( ;  ;  ;  ). Interpreting social interactions requires the interaction of various cognitive functions; among these are social attention mechanisms, mentalizing, language comprehension, and the recognition of faces, communicative gestures, goal-directed movements, and emotions ( ;  ;  ). In a laboratory setting, naturalistic stimuli such as movies or film sequences capture this complexity because they provide a means to represent the interacting information dynamically and within context ( ;  ;  ). With regard to social interactions in complex scenes, validated comprehensive typologies are lacking and their neural processing is unclear. \n\nDuring watching movies or film sequences, different neural networks were found involved depending on the study protocol and stimulus material. The most consistently reported neural correlates of social-cognitive functions encompass superior temporal gyrus (STG), temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), fusiform gyrus, and precuneus ( ;  ;  ;  ). In particular, the posterior STG and TPJ of the right hemisphere serve as key regions during the processing of real-life social interactions and joint attention ( ; for a meta-analysis see  ). Both regions may contribute to the analysis of social relations in movie clips ( ). Specific social signals in movies (e.g., faces, movement, social interactions, or speech) may even partially segregate four networks ( ): Scenes depicting social interactions engaged two of those networks, namely a temporal-amygdala network and a prefrontal-insula network. The introduction of an explicit mentalizing task modulated neuronal recruitment patterns ( ).; rating an agent\u2019s intention activated three independent neural networks, i.e., for face processing and recognition, language comprehension, as well as self-referential mental activity. Taken together, the significance of several cortical and subcortical structures for the processing of social interaction has become evident, but their specific contribution to the interpretation of interaction events, especially during naturalistic stimulation, remains to be determined. \n\nAlthough social interactions comprise several interwoven, multimodal cues, a behavioral pattern, as a whole, acts as a communicative sign and can thus be described using sign theory (semiotics). Semiotic categories describe cognitive categories, among other related phenomena ( ). Thus, semiotic models are amenable to cognitive-behavioral and neuroscientific testing ( ;  ;  ). Among one of the most influential contributions to the field of semiotics are the UCs introduced by Charles Sanders Peirce ( ,  ). Peirce\u2019s theory has been considered an appropriate semiotic framework for the study of cognitive processes ( ;  ;  ;  ) and has been applied to theoretical and empirical investigations in the fields of cognitive semiotics, linguistics, media science, and neurosciences. This semiotic theory is well suited for neuroimaging studies of multimodal communication because it emphasizes the perspective of the interpreting mind ( ), represented by the observers brain activity. This framework may describe the relation between perceived signs (e.g., the interactions shown in movie clips) and the   interpretant   ( ), i.e., the resulting cognitive representation in the participant\u2019s mind and subsequent brain activity during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. \n\nWith regard to the representation, transmission, and interpretation of signs, Peirce\u2019s UCs distinguish between three levels: \u201cFirstness\u201d pertains to potential, not-yet-resolved meaning; \u201cSecondness\u201d encapsulates the specific, contextualized meaning of a sign, particularly of non-habitual and non-conventional signs; and \u201cThirdness\u201d involves entrenched habits, patterns, and rules ( ). While semiotic categories typically interact to various degrees in a given sign process, one of them can be expected to predominate and, thus, determine the sign\u2019s main function, as well as the way it is perceived and interpreted ( ). We categorized non-verbal social interactions occurring within a film sequence into three types (  Figure   ): (1) \u201cunresolved\u201d interactions are ambiguous in the respective situation and their outcomes are not yet determined (emphasizing Firstness); (2) \u201cnon-habitual\u201d interactions counteract learned behavioral patterns and are disambiguated by the local context (emphasizing Secondness); and (3) \u201chabitual interactions\u201d include implicitly or explicitly learned behavioral patterns, which conform to social conventions (emphasizing Thirdness). (4) Verbal interactions largely rely on the conventional codes of a given language and culture and are subsumed in a forth category (high degree of Thirdness; see   Figure   ). This operationalization aims at the description of the sign-interpretant relation with respect to the UCs. We yielded three processing modes for the interpretation of non-verbal interactions and one for all verbal interactions, because spoken language is highly conventionalized and dominated by the Thirdness category. \n  \nCoded interaction types. Social interaction events occurring in the movie excerpt were annotated.   (A)   Peirce\u2019s semiotic framework of the Universal Categories inspired the differentiation of three cognitive processes during the interpretation of non-verbal and one during verbal social interactions. (1) Unresolved non-verbal interactions are ambiguous and the social situation is not yet resolved (reflecting the Firstness category of potential, not-yet-resolved meaning); (2) \u201cnon-habitual interactions\u201d counteract learned behavioral patterns and are disambiguated by the local context (reflecting the Secondness category of contextualized meaning); (3) \u201chabitual interactions\u201d rely on learned behavioral patterns and social conventions (reflecting the Thirdness category of conventional and habitual meaning); and, finally (4) words rely on the conventional codes of the language and thus verbal interaction reflect always the Thirdness category.   (B)   The movie frames depict exemplary events for each of the coded types of social interactions: (1) unresolved: two people wordlessly stare at each other; (2) non-habitual: a cyclist is grabbed by a passerby; (3) habitual: a carried child is touched in greeting; and (4) verbal: two persons engage in a conversation.

However, experimental evidence is still scarce for Peirce\u2019s basic constructs. Peirce aimed at a general semiotic theory that accounts for all kinds of sign processes in all kinds of modalities, including those occurring in nature and scientific inquiry; hence, his model of sign processes goes beyond communication   per se   ( ;  ). The UCs have inspired theoretical models developed to characterize and interpret manual gestures (e.g.,  ,  ;  ;  ,  ,  ;  ), onomatopoeia in language ( ;  ), and images ( ;  ), and further, describe narrative comprehension in both spoken and written stories ( ), film sequences ( ,  ;  ) and comics ( ;  ; see also   on multimodality). Qualitative analyses utilized aspects of Peirce\u2019s UCs for the investigation of mental imagery, human gestures, language evolution, and developmental aspects of communication and culture (for a review, see  ). However, despite many theoretical and qualitative approaches, empirical investigations are still rare. Best known, the sign-object relation is one aspect of the UCs, and has founded a prominent theoretical framework for empirical analyses of manual gestures (as \u201ciconic\u201d (UC1), \u201cdeictic\u201d (UC2), and \u201cemblematic\u201d (UC3) gestures;  ) in behavioral and neuroimaging studies on gesture perception and comprehension (for reviews, see  ;  ;  ). The sign-interpretant relation of the UCs has scarcely been used as a construct for neuroimaging studies. We investigated conventionality in co-speech gestures with the sign-interpretant relation of thirdness (UC3,  ). Perceiving a gesture as conventional increased intersubject covariance (ISC) in left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior STG. The present study employed aspects of the UCs to create stimulus categories in a neurocognitive experiment. Social interactions were labeled with semiotic categories derived from the UCs and their neural response patterns were analyzed. \n\nAssuming that semiotic categories influence the cognitive and neural processing of the interpretant, the semiotic characterization of social interactions differentiates neural processes during the observation of social interactions. Functional MRI recorded neural responses to social interactions portrayed during a 20-min movie narrative. The three types of non-verbal interactions (unresolved, non-habitual, and habitual) and any verbal interactions were coded. First, we aimed to confirm that this method yields neural correlates of social interactions encompassing the relevant sensory, language, visual, and social cognitive networks. In specific, we hypothesized that brain areas supporting the interpretation of verbal interactions lean more toward auditory processes whereas non-verbal interactions elicit stronger visuo-spatial processing. Second, the recruitment of these brain areas during the observation of non-verbal interactions was expected to depend on the predominant semiotic category (visible by the extracted beta values). Third, we explored neural patterns contributing to the encoding of Peirce\u2019s semiotic categories in a whole-brain analysis. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Study Participants \n  \nSixteen right-handed native German speakers (seven women, age 26.1 \u00b1 3.8, range 22\u201334 years) participated in the present study. Participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, normal hearing, and no history of psychiatric, neurological, or mental disorders. The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee and the experiment was designed and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave written informed consent and received financial reimbursement. \n\n\n### Stimulation \n  \nParticipants were presented with a film sequence showing a 20-min excerpt from the German movie \u201cLola rennt\u201d (Engl.: \u201cRun Lola Run\u201d; 10:20\u201330:20 min; X-Filme Creative Pool, Germany, 1998). The movie excerpt was chosen because it comprises a self-contained narrative with a fast-paced story line within a reasonable time frame (20-min). Video was delivered by a projector system with reflecting mirrors (Psychology Software Tools, Sharpsburg, PA, United States), and audio was delivered by earplugs (Nordic Neurolab Bergen, Norway). The sound was individually adjusted to a comfortable hearing level. Stimulus delivery and timing was controlled using the stimulation software Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems Inc., United States). Before the film sequence started, a fixation cross was presented for 25 s. The participants were asked to watch attentively. \n\n\n### Coding of Social Interactions in the Movie \n  \nA film sequence is a naturalistic stimulus in which a multitude of features interact. In order to model the specific appearance of social interactions we used an established content-coding approach for model-based analysis ( ;  ;  ,  ;  ). We annotated the onsets and duration of social interaction events in the movie excerpt on a frame-by-frame basis with 67 ms accuracy, corresponding to a 15 Hz frame rate. The content-coding system distinguished three types of non-verbal social interactions: (1) unresolved, (2) non-habitual, and (3) habitual; as well as four verbal interactions (for an overview, see   Figure   ). For each event, exactly one of the interaction types was annotated. Verbal interactions were coded whenever speech was involved in the interaction event. The duration of a verbal interaction event corresponded to the duration of the utterance. Pauses up to two seconds between words or utterances were coded as continuous verbal interaction. Pauses lasting longer than two seconds were coded as a non-verbal interaction. Non-verbal interactions could immediately precede or follow a verbal interaction (e.g., an \u201cunresolved interaction\u201d is followed by a \u201cverbal interaction\u201d). Furthermore, non-verbal interaction types may immediately follow each other (e.g., an \u201cunresolved interaction\u201d is followed by a \u201chabitual interaction\u201d). The complete movie excerpt was annotated twice by two independent coders. Inter-coder reliability for the differentiation between interaction types was determined with Krippendorff\u2019s alpha (.62). In cases when the coders disagreed, a supervisory decision was taken by a third coder (D.W.). In total, 170 interaction events were annotated yielding a total duration of 476.5 s (average duration: 2.8 \u00b1 5.8 s, mean \u00b1 SD). Of those interaction events, 65 were coded as \u201cunresolved\u201d (total duration: 132.6 s; average: 1.7 \u00b1 2.5 s), 19 events were coded as \u201cnon-habitual\u201d (total duration: 10.0 s; average: 0.5 \u00b1 0.6 s), 22 events were coded as \u201chabitual\u201d (total duration: 42.2 s; average: 1.9 \u00b1 2.5 s), and 64 events were coded as \u201cverbal\u201d (total duration: 291.7 s; average: 4.6 \u00b1 8.8 s). \n\n\n### MR Data Acquisition \n  \nFunctional MRI was conducted using a 3 Tesla Siemens Scanner (Magnetom Trio, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) and a 32-channel phased-array receive-only head coil. Echo planar imaging (EPI) collected functional images sensitive to the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast. The applied EPI sequence acquired multiple echoes after a single excitation pulse. Subsequently, the obtained images were weighted and combined. This procedure increases signal-to-noise ratio ( ), which may be particularly beneficial for investigations that utilize naturalistic stimuli. With the following parameters, 487 volumes were acquired: 24 slices; echo time (TE) = 17.0, 45.9, and 74.9 ms; repetition time (TR) = 2540 ms; flip angle (FA) = 90\u00b0; slice thickness = 3.5 mm; slice gap = 0.5 mm; matrix size = 64 \u00d7 64, field of view (FOV) = 224 mm  \u00d7 224 mm ; voxel size = 3.5 mm  \u00d7 3.5 mm  \u00d7 3.5 mm , and bandwidth = 2232 Hz/pixel. \n\n\n### Data Analysis \n  \nFunctional MRI data analysis was conducted using the software Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 8, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience UCL, London, United Kingdom). The first five volumes of each session were discarded to reduce T1 saturation effects. Images were spatially realigned, normalized to the stereotactic MNI space (Montreal Neurological Institute;  ) and resampled to 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm\u00d72 mm voxels. Spatial smoothing with a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel of 12 mm was applied to the normalized data. The single-echo images were combined after normalization based on the optimized-CNR approach, i.e., each image voxel was weighted with a function of the estimated signal-to-noise ratio and the expected BOLD sensitivity ( ;  ; see   for detailed methodological descriptions). \n\nThe onset and duration of each coded event entered a general linear model (GLM) with one predictor of interest for each interaction type (unresolved, non-habitual, habitual, and verbal). Using the canonical response function, a model for the BOLD responses to the events was constructed. In the first-level statistical analysis, the contrast of the four stimuli types against the baseline (the ongoing movie) was determined. The four contrast maps of each subject entered the repeated-measures ANOVA for second-level analysis. An   F  -test determined effects of the four interaction types against baseline.   Post hoc   t  -tests compared the verbal with the non-verbal interactions. A second   F  -test explored the activation patterns differentiating the semiotic categories of observed non-verbal interactions.   Post hoc   t  -tests compared non-verbal interaction types in a pairwise fashion. Each map in the second-level group analyses was corrected with a voxelwise family-wise error (FWE;  ) of   p   < 0.05. All remaining clusters survived a clusterwise   p   < 0.05 thresholding. \n\nRegion-of-interest (ROI) analyses investigated differences between the three non-verbal interaction types. Therefore, the selected ROIs differentiated the verbal from the non-verbal interactions and vice versa. For the verbal condition, peak locations were obtained from the contrast \u201cverbal > non-verbal.\u201d For the non-verbal conditions, the inversed contrast \u201cnon-verbal > verbal\u201d was considered; extended clusters were segregated into meaningful anatomical structures according to the AAL atlas ( ): fusiform gyrus (bilateral), calcarine gyrus (bilateral), right IFG pars triangularis (IFG PTr), and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG). Due to the orthogonality of the SPM second-level design matrix, we assumed orthogonality of the estimate for the \u201cverbal versus non-verbal\u201d contrast with the one for the contrasts between the non-verbal subtypes; therefore the data were explored with standard univariate ANOVAs. Significant differences across the non-verbal interaction types were determined with one-factor ANOVAs and corrected for multiple comparisons according to Bonferroni-Holm. Statistics were performed with IBM SPSS (Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0, Armonk, NY, United States). \n\nIn a supplementary analysis the validity of the obtained neural functioning for the processing of verbal information and social interaction was confirmed with anatomical masks from Neurosynth ; this toolbox provides neuroanatomical information based on meta-analysis of fMRI studies. The images for the terms \u201cverbal\u201d (615 studies) and \u201csocial interaction\u201d (94 studies) were merged and served for small-volume correction of the contrasts \u201cverbal > non-verbal\u201d and \u201cnon-verbal > verbal\u201d as well as the individual   t  -contrasts comparing the non-verbal interaction types. Segregation of anatomical structures and the extraction of ROI data were performed as described above. Significant differences in peak-voxel activation were explored with univariate ANOVAs. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Neural Responses to the Observation of Social Interactions \n  \nDuring social interactions, several brain regions exhibited activity increases, including primary auditory and visual areas as well as higher order visual pathways (  Figure    and   Table   ). Previous studies reported medial PFC activations (e.g.,  ), which emerged in our data only after lowering the threshold to   p   < 0.001 uncorrected. Differences between verbal and non-verbal interactions were investigated with   t  -tests contrasting responses to verbal interactions against the average response to the three non-verbal interaction types. The contrast \u201cverbal > non-verbal\u201d yielded strong bilateral activation in auditory processing areas (STG extending into middle temporal gyrus (MTG);   Figure    and   Table   ). The reversed contrast \u201cnon-verbal > verbal\u201d yielded widespread brain regions, in particular, the visual pathway emerged encompassing occipital, inferior temporal, and superior parietal cortices as well as right prefrontal areas (  Figure    and   Table   ). \n  \nNeural correlates of social interactions. Social interaction events in a movie narrative were coded as four types (unresolved, non-habitual, habitual, and verbal). An   F  -test across the four predictors revealed widespread brain activation of auditory and visual networks. Such pattern is commonly observed during the perception of naturalistic social stimuli, suggesting an important role for the observation of social interaction events. LH, left hemisphere; RH, right hemisphere; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; IOG, inferior occipital gyrus; IPL, inferior parietal lobe; ITG, inferior temporal gyrus; MOG, middle occipital gyrus; MTG, middle temporal gyrus; (p)STG, (posterior) superior temporal gyrus; SPL, superior parietal lobe; TPJ, temporo-parietal junction;   z  -coordinates are indicated beneath each slice. \n    \nNeural networks for the processing of verbal and non-verbal interactions. The contrasts between   (A)   verbal (\u201cverbal > non-verbal\u201d) and   (B)   non-verbal (\u201cnon-verbal > verbal\u201d) interactions separated the networks for visual-based and sound-based information processing. ROI analyses of regional peak voxels revealed specific contributions for the non-verbal interaction types (\u201cunresolved,\u201d \u201cnon-habitual,\u201d and \u201chabitual\u201d). Auditory regions were recruited during the observations of unresolved interactions but suppressed during habitual interactions. Non-habitual interactions yielded the involvement of visual and prefrontal areas. LH, left hemisphere; RH, right hemisphere; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; MFG, middle frontal gyrus; STG, superior temporal gyrus;   p   < 0.05;   p   < 0.01;   p   < 0.001;   z  -coordinates are indicated beneath each slice. \n    \nCluster table for   F  -tests. \n      \nCluster table for comparison between verbal and non-verbal interactions. \n    \nTo differentiate the effect of the three non-verbal interaction types, a ROI analysis was performed in the peak-voxels of the contrasts between verbal and non-verbal interactions. Verbal interactions yielded higher responses in bilateral auditory cortices than non-verbal ones [left: MNI (  x,y,z  ) = \u221262, \u221226, \u22122 (STG); right: 62, 0, \u22128 (STG);   Figure   ]. In the left hemispheric ROI only, a modulation with respect to the three non-verbal interaction types emerged (left:   F   = 7.00,   p   = 0.002; right:   F   = 1.78,   p   = 0.18, n.s.). The activation differences were characterized by a gradient from unresolved to non-habitual to habitual interactions (see inserts in   Figure   ): In   post hoc   t  -tests, unresolved interactions yielded higher activity as compared to habitual interactions (  t   = 5.28,   p   < 0.001) and to non-habitual interactions (  t   = 2.60,   p   = 0.02; habitual versus non-habitual:   t   = 0.98,   p   = 0.344, n.s.). For the non-verbal contrast, six ROIs emerged: left fusiform gyrus (\u221232, \u221264, and \u221218), right fusiform gyrus (28, \u221238, and \u221222), left calcarine gyrus (2, \u221280, and \u22124), right calcarine gyrus (16, \u221256, and 8), right IFG PTr (54, 24, and 32), and right MFG (44, 0, and 58). In each ROI a significant difference between the non-verbal conditions emerged (all   p   < 0.001;   Figure   ). In the   post hoc t  -test, non-habitual interactions yielded larger activation than the two other types (all   t   > 3.80,   p   < 0.003; see inserts in   Figure   ). After applying the Neurosynth-based mask, two ROIs emerged for verbal interactions over nonverbal interactions (peak voxels: left STG: \u221262, \u221226, and \u22122; right STG: 62, \u22122, and \u22126) and five ROIs for non-verbal interactions (peak voxels: left fusiform gyrus: \u221232, \u221262, and \u221218; right fusiform gyrus: 30, \u221262, and \u221216; left calcarine gyrus: \u221210, \u221290, and 4; right calcarine gyrus: 14, \u221268, and 8; right IFG PTr: 54, 24, and 32). The Neurosynth-mask did not cover the cluster detected in the right MFG. In each of the remaining ROIs, the significant differences between the non-verbal conditions as well as the larger activation for non-habitual interactions were confirmed (all   p   < 0.001;   Supplementary Figure   ). Thus, the functional responses obtained during watching naturalistic stimulation were in accordance with meta-analytical maps for verbal stimulation and social interactions. The widespread activation of cortical regions during the processing of non-verbal interactions was grounded in the processing of non-habitual interactions. \n\n\n### Brain Regions Underlying UCs in Non-verbal Interactions \n  \nWe further explored brain regions that engaged differentially in the encoding of the semiotic categories of the observed non-verbal social interactions. Thereto, we conducted mappings of the differences between the three conditions with an   F  -test and   post hoc t  -tests. The   F  -test yielded an extended pattern of brain regions with the highest activations in the fusiform gyrus and middle occipital gyrus (MOG; see   Figure    and   Table   ), similar to those obtained for the contrast between non-verbal and verbal interactions (compare with   Figure   ). Of the six directed comparisons in the   post hoc t  -tests, four yielded significant clusters at a threshold according to a   p   < 0.05 (  Figure    and   Table   ). First, specific contributions of both other types \u2013 anticipation and non-habituality \u2013 emerged when contrasted to habitual interactions: Neural responses were increased in the left STG and TPJ during unresolved interactions (right upper panel in   Figure   ) and in the right fusiform gyrus and bilateral TPJ during non-habitual interactions (left upper panel in   Figure   ). Using the unresolved condition as baseline, habitual interactions yielded higher activation in the left parahippocampal gyrus and bilateral MOG (right lower panel in   Figure   ), and non-habitual interactions elicited higher activation in the right IFG as well as bilateral fusiform gyrus, TPJ, and MOG (left lower panel in   Figure   ). The contrasts \u201cunresolved > non-habitual\u201d and \u201chabitual > non-habitual\u201d did not yield differences at the same threshold. After correction of the contrasts with the Neurosynth-based mask, each of the detected clusters fell \u2013 at least partly \u2013 into the brain mask (  Supplementary Figure    and   Supplementary Table   ). Involvement of the reported brain regions in processing of verbal information and social interaction was thereby validated based on this meta-analytical approach. \n  \nNeural networks for the processing of non-verbal interactions.   (A)   The specific   F  -test differentiated processing networks for the semiotic categories (\u201cunresolved,\u201d \u201cnon-habitual,\u201d and \u201chabitual\u201d).   (B)   Post hoc t  -maps determined specific effects in four directed contrasts. As an extension to the ROI analysis, the TPJ may be relevant for the interpretation of unresolved or non-habitual interactions, whereas the hippocampus and the LOC responded most strongly to habitual interactions. LH, left hemisphere; RH, right hemisphere; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; LOC, lateral occipital complex; pSTG, posterior superior temporal gyrus; MFG, middle frontal gyrus; MOG, middle occipital gyrus; SOG, superior occipital gyrus; TPJ, temporo-parietal junction;   z  -coordinates are indicated beneath each slice. \n    \nCluster table for comparison between non-verbal interaction types (  Figure   ). \n    \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe identified types of non-verbal social interactions in a movie narrative based on a coding scheme derived from the semiotic framework of Peirce\u2019s UCs and segregated neural processes during the observation of such interactions. Three non-verbal interaction types were determined: unresolved (predominant Firstness Category), non-habitual (Secondness), and habitual (Thirdness). These non-verbal interactions together with the verbal ones yielded activations in brain structures involved during naturalistic viewing conditions. The non-verbal interactions yielded lower auditory activation than verbal ones, but significant effects of type emerged: Unresolved events primed auditory cortex, whereas habitual ones suppressed it. Increased activity after non-verbal compared to verbal interactions in the visual cortex and right lateral PFC was due to non-habitual interactions. Further exploration across interaction types revealed that non-habitual interactions yielded higher TPJ activations than unresolved and, most markedly, habitual interactions. The latter recruited the parahippocampal gyrus and lateral occipital complex (LOC) more than unresolved interactions. In summary, Peirce\u2019s cognitive-semiotic categories distinguished three modes for interpreting social interactions. Their underlying cognitive mechanisms led to neural representations of perception and interpretation during the observation of an ongoing film sequence. \n\n### Neural Responses to Social Interactions \n  \nWidespread brain regions encompassing visual, auditory, and object-processing areas responded to social interactions shown in a movie. Similar patterns of activation have been observed when contrasting social versus non-social contents depicted in photographs ( ) and movie clips ( ;  ;  ). In particular, the reported brain structures comprised bilateral fusiform cortex, superior temporal cortex extending into the TPJ, right inferior frontal cortex, and dorsomedial PFC. Such pattern is readily expected from sensory and perceptual processing, but lacks involvement of the language networks (i.e., left IFG \u201cBroca\u201d and pSTG \u201cWernicke\u201d). Similarly, under naturalistic stimulation conditions in previous studies not explicitly investigating language processing, language network responded weakly only ( ;  ;  ). The weak recruitment of prefrontal structures in our study (not surpassing the corrected threshold) may be explained by the lack of an explicit task aiming at social cognition ( ;  ). Indeed, frontal-cortical activation was found to be variable during film clips ( ;  ). Taken together, the content-coded social interactions yielded activation patterns in established networks for perceptual processes and social cognition, yielding validity to our event related coding of social interactions during naturalistic stimulation. \n\n\n### Neuronal Correlates of Interactions Types \n  \nThe contrast between non-verbal and verbal interactions separated networks for auditory and visual processing. As expected, the bilateral STG responded most strongly to verbal interactions, whereas non-verbal interactions activated visual pathways. The latter finding suggests that during verbal stimulation visual cues are less processed ( ). In addition to this clear pattern, the non-verbal, non-auditory interactions yielded a cross-modal modulation in the bilateral STG extending into the MTG. Both the ROI analysis and the comparative mapping across interaction types revealed that STG recruitment was increased for unresolved interactions and was decreased for habitual interactions. Attempts to disambiguate unresolved, socially relevant interactions may prime temporal auditory areas to seek additional auditory cues. In a similar vein, during an audio-visual emotion judgment task, the influence of one modality was greater when the other modality provided ambiguous information ( ). This effect is thought to be based on cross-modal modulation of basic perception. For instance, magnetoencephalographic studies reported anticipatory pre-activation of auditory cortex by visual motion cues ( ) and modulatory effects of predictability in an audio-visual apparent motion task ( ). The cross-modal priming effect also enhances processing of communication and interaction. A modulation of superior temporal regions supporting auditory processing has been reported for changes in perceived communicative intent ( ), contextual embedding of speech ( ), stimulus familiarity ( ), and perceived intentionality of actions ( ). Taken together, the STG and MTG were sensitive to interpretation processes for communicative actions and interactions. Thus, in the absence of speech, ambiguous visual information (unresolved social interactions, Firstness category) increased neural involvement in processing anticipated speech and behavior. \n\nNon-verbal interactions recruited visual areas and the right lateral PFC more than verbal interactions. This activation was entirely due to responses to non-habitual interactions (Secondness category) and not to the unresolved or habitual ones. It seems that observing non-habitual interactions required enhanced visual processing. Implication of the right lateral PFC regions indicates that the processing focus may be particularly on the contextualization of action and movement patterns. There is evidence that both the right IFG and MFG are involved in the representation of goal-directed aspects of actions ( ) and in the interpretation of actions in social contexts ( ). Indeed, the lateral PFC supports learning and employing rule knowledge relevant to actions (for a review, see  ). More specifically, the right PFC contributes to the creation and testing of rules ( ;  ), particularly when these need to be integrated into contextual information ( ;  ). In previous research, the involvement of the lateral PFC during the learning and application of rules has been implicated in both concrete experiential tasks and the formation of abstract behavior-independent rules ( ;  ), and, further, to patterns of appropriate behavior within a given social context ( ;  ;  ). In the same vein, the right IFG was related to contextual integration involved in the comprehension of unconventional communicative object configurations ( ). Our finding that observing non-habitual interactions recruits right IFG/MFG contributes to this line of research. When encountering a behavior which discords with context-based expectations, new hypotheses of social rules and intentions need to be formulated; this process may recruit right IFG/MFG. This view is in agreement with the conceptualizing of Secondness by Peirce, where the interpreter contextualizes signs and has not yet formed rules ( ). \n\nIn non-habitual interactions the observed agent did not act in accordance with socially accepted behavior and, therefore, displayed unexpected behaviors that contrasted with the observer\u2019s predictions ( ). This may have led, first, to an allocation of attention toward the agent\u2019s actions ( ) as well as toward the reaction of the interacting partner, and, second, to a re-evaluation and remodeling of the agent\u2019s intentions and motivations ( ;  ). When directly contrasting non-habitual with habitual interactions and with unresolved interactions, we detected particularly strong bilateral TPJ activation. A susceptibility of TPJ to other people\u2019s intentions was demonstrated for the right TPJ in response to observing incorrect goal-oriented hand/arm movements ( ), observing motoric and social errors ( ), and intentional whole body action ( ). These findings indicate enhanced recruitment of TPJ during the evaluation and modeling of an observed agent\u2019s intentions. \n\nAn alternative explanation for increased activation in visual processing areas, TPJ, and right frontal cortex may reside in the increased saliency of unexpected behaviors. Although expectation (stimulus is expected versus unexpected) and attention (stimulus is relevant versus irrelevant) are dissociable mechanisms in the visual system ( ), both may have interacted during the observation of non-habitual interactions. Increased activation in the right TPJ and the IFG has been found for experimentally induced competition between several salient visual events during free viewing of movie clips ( ). However, the scenes depicted single or interacting people and thus were social in nature as well. Furthermore, a sharp differentiation between salience-induced attentional processes and mentalizing processes (as part of Theory of Mind) may be inconsequential during social cognition. Both processes can be understood in terms of contextual updating, which is a suggested key function of TPJ ( ). Therefore, during observation of socially relevant scenes, attentional processes may help evaluate the appropriateness of the observed actions and model possible motives and reactions of the interacting partner. \n\n\n### Habitual Non-verbal Interactions \n  \nThe contrasts between verbal and non-verbal interactions have elucidated the distinct contributions of unresolved and non-habitual interactions. Further, specific effects for habitual interactions (Thirdness category) emerged in the direct contrasts between non-verbal interaction types. The bilateral LOC and the left parahippocampal gyrus were activated more in response to habitual than to unresolved interactions. Habitual \u2013 and thus rule-conforming \u2013 actions are well-learned and regularly encountered in everyday life. Therefore, visual scene analysis and matching input to memory representations may dominate the interpretation process. The LOC is traditionally associated with processing and recognizing faces, body parts, and goal-directed movements as well as general motion patterns (for a review, see  ). The parahippocampal gyrus contributes to associative memory and visuo-spatial processing (for a review, see  ). Therefore, the LOC-parahippocampal network may represent real-world scenes complementing the perception of photographs ( ) and movie clips ( ). Interpreting interactions as habitual and conforming to social rules seems to be associated with processing in object-recognition and memory structures. \n\nHabitual interactions are not only well-learned but also conform to schematic behavioral patterns and social rules. The LOC-parahippocampal network may additionally contribute to the extraction, recognition, and contextualization of behavioral patterns. Involvement of the LOC has been reported for contextual guidance during visual search in complex scenes ( ), the creation of category-level templates for recognizing humans and objects ( ), and the abstraction of actions from agents ( ). Similarly, increased activation in the parahippocampal gyrus has been reported both for goal-oriented actions ( ) and for more abstract functions of scene analysis such as scene categories ( ), locational concepts ( ), and perceptual schema representations ( ). These processes may contribute to the understanding of action schemas, which are, on a mechanistic level, the basis of habitual social interactions. Thus, our results indicate that during the observation of habitual interactions, the parahippocampal gyrus and the LOC interact to evaluate the observed action patterns. \n\n\n### Universal Categories and Neural Activation Patterns \n  \nThe interpretation of social interactions requires synergy of various cognitive functions raging from multimodal perception and social attention to language comprehension and mentalizing ( ;  ;  ). As novel means to a comprehensive typology, Peirce\u2019s semiotic framework of UCs was utilized to inform three types of social interactions. These interaction types were presented in a movie context and yielded distinct neural patterns. The Firstness category is predominant in unresolved social interactions, which recruited bilateral STG. Conceivably, in ambiguous social situations, attention was directed toward the auditory modality (e.g.,  ), as is predicted by the \u201cprinciple of inverse effectiveness\u201d ( ). The perception of a stimulus can be altered by a cue from another modality ( ); in particular, audiovisual stimuli of lower intensity yield larger recognition benefit that those with higher intensity ( ;  ). During unresolved interactions, when information density of the visual modality was reduced, auditory processing increased. Spoken language is highly codified and thus effectively resolves a situation. \n\nSocial interactions of the Secondness category (non-habitual) required the highest processing demand in visuo-spatial, mentalizing, and contextual rule-learning areas (IFG). This pattern suggests increased attention toward the unexpected behavior and a re-evaluation of the observed agent\u2019s intentions within the situational context ( ). This mismatch between prior expectations and reality triggers a cognitive prediction error, which has been associated particularly with dorsolateral PFC ( ;  ). Prediction error processing elicits attentional orienting and underlies mentalizing and contextual learning ( ). \n\nThe observation of habitual interactions (Thirdness category) recruited brain regions supporting conceptual processing and associative memory retrieval. Habitual behaviors may be encoded as learned action patterns and social schemas ( ), Social schemas are memory representations of typical contexts ( ), which guide and facilitate the processing of social information ( ) and their reconstruction from memory ( ); the latter involves the ventromedial PFC regions ( ) rather than lateral PFC. \n\nTaken together, characterizing non-verbal social interactions with Peirce\u2019s cognitive-semiotic categories enabled the holistic neurosemiotic investigation of complex social cognition. Such a semiotic approach offers a novel means to investigate the neural representation of communication in naturalistic stimuli. \n\nBuilding on Peirce\u2019s semiotic theory, various theoretical frameworks highlight specific aspects of communicative signs. For instance, the UCs have been instrumental to empirical analyses of manual gestures ( ,  ;  ;  ,  ,  ;  ). McNeill\u2019s Peirce-inspired differentiation of gestures into iconic gestures (icon, Firstness category), deictic gestures (index, Secondness category), and emblems (symbol, Thirdness category;  ,  ) has become a prominent strand within gesture research. Neuroimaging studies on gesture perception and comprehension revealed that manual gestures in general recruited the language systems (IFG and posterior superior temporal sulcus) and the action-movement systems (inferior parietal and premotor cortex;  ) whereas iconic gestures, representing salient visual features of an object referred to in speech, activated a fronto- posterior temporal network ( ). Furthermore, emblems, being symbolic and highly conventionalized signs, recruited the language networks ( ;  ). \n\nSymbolic and conventionalized meaning corresponds to Thirdness in Peirce\u2019s UCs ( ;  ;  ) and is considered in neurocognitive investigations not only for gesture comprehension ( ;  ) but also for the perception of communicative signs in a broader sense ( ;  ;  ). For instance, pictures of objects activated the language network (like words) if they were perceived as symbolic ( ) or when they conveyed abstract social meaning ( ). Furthermore, Peirce\u2019s UCs have inspired theories regarding the emergence of social conventions and symbolic communication during language evolution ( ) and during child development ( ). These examples emphasize the applicability of Peirce\u2019s semiotics for the investigation of communicative signs and behaviors with respect to various signal properties. However, since empirical studies are still scarce and the operationalizations vary across studies, the picture is yet incoherent and impedes generalizations ( ;  ). The application of UCs has a high potential with regards to investigating communication processes and should be further explored in the context of social learning or social impairments such as seen in patients with schizophrenia or autism spectrum disorders. \n\n\n### Methodological Considerations and Limitations \n  \nIn order to relate functional responses to the social interaction types we conducted a GLM analysis and corrected the resulting brain maps with voxelwise FWE correction (  p   < 0.05). To minimize spurious activation voxels, only cluster with size according to a cluster-wise FWE correction are reported. Furthermore, localizations were confirmed with a Neurosynth-based a priori mask, with one exception. The cluster in right MFG for non-verbal interactions over verbal interaction failed to overlap with the mask and, thus, may constitute a false positive result and needs to be confirmed in follow up studies. \n\nThe unequal distribution of events and event-durations introduces differences in the amount of observations. This heterogeneity may cause a violation of the heteroscedasticity assumption for analyses of variance. Therefore, the model estimation was done with assuming unequal-variance as provided by SPM. Thus we minimized the statistical bias due to the violation of the heteroscedasticity assumption of the regressors. The imbalance of event numbers and durations constitutes a limitation of the analysis, but also reflects the nature of naturalistic stimulation. Naturalistic stimuli such as movie clips are inherently complex and contain a multitude of diverse, dynamic, and interacting information. Although natural viewing conditions offer superior ecological validity compared to more traditional experimental paradigms, the stimulus conditions are less well controlled ( ). The number of events and the total duration vary across the coded interaction types. With our content-coding based GLM approach, we aimed to model the neural responses to social interaction types by generalizing across movie scenes and, therefore, by and large independently of other movie contents. However, since the presentation of events is not controlled or randomized, the stimuli may differ in complexity and may coincide with other influencing factors or physical characteristics. Nevertheless, the congruent neural patterns to other studies investigating social interactions lend credibility to this pseudo-experimental design, as shown in previous studies employing similar content-coding methodology (e.g.,  ). \n\nThe movie \u201cLola rennt\u201d comprised a large variety of social situations and scenes as well as different cinematographic elements and thus may be considered a comprehensive naturalistic stimulus; nevertheless, the activation patterns may be stimulus-specific and may not generalize to other movie-excerpts. Until now, movie excerpts were mainly analyzed with data driven methods such as ISC and independent-component analysis (ICA), instead of a model-based approach. Therefore, additional studies using model-based analyses need to determine stimulus-independence and generalizability of the here presented activation patterns. \n\nPeirce\u2019s pragmatic approach to communication processes makes his theory well suited for systematic analyses ( ,  ;  ). Our content-coding based design is a theory-driven approach to iteratively obtain a meaningful typology of non-verbal social interactions ( ). The coding results show a good reliability. Validity is, on the one hand, established by the theoretical foundation and, on the other hand, confirmed by the meaningful neural contributions ( ). The approach based on semiotic categories facilitates neurocognitive analysis; however, additional non-categorical, continuous measures may reflect interaction-related features in more detail. Further refinements of the operationalization can target not only the validity of the coding but may employ the UCs to also describe other processes that underlie the perception and comprehension of various kinds of signs. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe operationalized Peirce\u2019s semiotic typology to describe basic social cognitive categories of non-verbal interactions in a movie narrative. Functional imaging revealed specific and meaningful responses in the brain to the observed events. Firstness: During the observation of unresolved interactions, the ambiguous visual information enhanced neural involvement in bilateral STG even in the absence of speech \u2013 conceivably as a cognitive mechanism to attend to additional resolving cues in another modality. Secondness: In response to non-habitual interactions that contrasted contextual expectations, the visual and prefrontal cortices as well as the TPJ supported the interpretation of intentions and the re-evaluation of social rules. Thirdness: The interpretation of habitual interactions recruited neural correlates for object recognition and associative memory. Semiotic approaches may help to elucidate mechanisms of social communication beyond confined linguistic theories. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nDW have designed, tested and applied the content coding scheme, analyzed and interpreted the data, and wrote the manuscript.

{"text": "Jacob, Michael S. and Ford, Judith M. and Roach, Brian J. and Calhoun, Vince D. and Mathalon, Daniel H.\nNeuroimage Clin, 2019\n\n# Title\n\nAberrant activity in conceptual networks underlies N400 deficits and unusual thoughts in schizophrenia\n\n# Keywords\n\nSchizophrenia\nSemantic priming\nN400\nJoint-ICA\nfMRI\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nThe N400 event-related potential (ERP) is triggered by meaningful stimuli that are incongruous, or unmatched, with their semantic context. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have identified brain regions activated by semantic incongruity, but their precise links to the N400 ERP are unclear. In schizophrenia (SZ), N400 amplitude reduction is thought to reflect overly broad associations in semantic networks, but the abnormalities in brain networks underlying deficient N400 remain unknown. We utilized joint independent component analysis (JICA) to link temporal patterns in ERPs to neuroanatomical patterns from fMRI and investigate relationships between N400 amplitude and neuroanatomical activation in SZ patients and healthy controls (HC). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nSZ patients (  n  \u202f=\u202f24) and HC participants (  n  \u202f=\u202f25) performed a picture-word matching task, in which words were either matched (APPLE\u2192apple) by preceding pictures, or were unmatched by semantically related (in-category; IC, APPLE\u2192lemon) or unrelated (out of category; OC, APPLE\u2192cow) pictures, in separate ERP and fMRI sessions. A JICA \u201cdata fusion\u201d analysis was conducted to identify the fMRI brain regions specifically associated with the ERP N400 component. SZ and HC loading weights were compared and correlations with clinical symptoms were assessed. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nJICA identified an ERP-fMRI \u201cfused\u201d component that captured the N400, with loading weights that were reduced in SZ. The JICA map for the IC condition showed peaks of activation in the cingulate, precuneus, bilateral temporal poles and cerebellum, whereas the JICA map from the OC condition was linked primarily to visual cortical activation and the left temporal pole. Among SZ patients, fMRI activity from the IC condition was inversely correlated with unusual thought content. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe neural networks associated with the N400 ERP response to semantic violations depends on conceptual relatedness. These findings are consistent with a distributed network underlying neural responses to semantic incongruity including unimodal visual areas as well as integrative, transmodal areas. Unusual thoughts in SZ may reflect impaired processing in transmodal hub regions such as the precuneus, leading to overly broad semantic associations. \n\n   Highlights  \n  \nHemodynamic activity linked to N400 responses is distributed across the brain. \n  \nN400 linked networks depend on conceptual relatedness. \n  \nMagnitude of the N400 ERP-fMRI fused component is reduced in schizophrenia. \n  \nN400 linked network activity inversely correlates with unusual thought content. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \n### he N400 as a tool to study semantic processing \n  \nThe human capacity to map semantic meaning onto objects has long been thought to result from an interaction between perceptual and conceptual functions ( ). Semantic processing refers to the generation and mapping of those meanings in symbolic language ( ). The brain is exquisitely tuned to deviations in semantic context, revealed electrophysiologically as a negative deflection known as the N400 ERP ( ), peaking 400\u202fms after the presentation of a stimulus that is not semantically related to the context. Although initially discovered from semantic violations within a sentence ( ), the N400 has been reported for a variety of paradigms, including incongruous placement ( ) or utilization of objects ( ). Such evidence suggests a range of cortical networks might subserve the N400 response, however, the anatomical generators have been studied primarily in language tasks, where most stimuli are words, spoken or written ( ). Knowledge of the anatomical generators is also limited by the use of scalp recorded ERPs, which have excellent temporal, but poor anatomical precision ( ). \n\n\n### Relevance to schizophrenia (SZ) \n  \nImpaired semantic networks are seen in SZ ( ;  ) and might underlie aspects of formal thought disorder or unusual thought content ( ). We have previously found evidence for diminished N400 responses in SZ for cross-modal picture-word matching tasks, which have been interpreted as an overly broad spread of semantic spreading activation ( ,  ). N400 amplitudes in SZ are associated with real-world functional impairment ( ), psychotic symptoms such as delusions ( ), formal thought disorder ( ) and responses to pharmacotherapy ( ). The contribution of visual processing deficits and/or the brain networks subserving semantic impairment remains unknown. \n\n\n### Goals of this experiment \n  \nTo understand the neural basis of N400 and how it is affected by SZ, we integrated ERP and fMRI datasets collected from independent recording sessions during a picture-word semantic priming task. Results from the ERP portion of this dataset have already been reported ( ). We utilized joint independent component analysis (JICA) to determine the patterns of spatial (from fMRI) and temporal (from ERP) covariance associated with processing words preceded by pictures that were matches, related semantically, or unrelated to the pictures. \n\nJICA is a data-driven, blind source separation technique which can explain the underlying structure of multimodal data. We predicted that an N400 joint component would reflect covariation of N400 amplitude, revealing reduced loading weights of the identified joint component in SZ patients relative to healthy control (HC) subjects. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the joint component would be linked to activation in a distributed language network including inferior frontal and temporal regions as reported previously ( ). To address these hypotheses, we utilized JICA ( ;  ) to identify brain regions associated with the ERP N400 component. We used the results of the JICA to probe for correlations in clinical symptoms. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nPatients with schizophrenia (  n  \u202f=\u202f26) and age-matched healthy controls (  n  \u202f=\u202f27) participated in both EEG and fMRI recording sessions (five participants were excluded for motion artifact, 3 HCs and 2 SZs, see below). ERP and fMRI recording session order was counterbalanced across groups and performed on average 16.1\u202fdays apart (range: same day-93\u202fdays, see Supplementary Table 1). Demographic data (including age, sex, parental SES, handedness, years of education and PANSS symptom ratings are included in Supplementary Table 1.) Experimental procedures were fully described to all participants after which they provided written informed consent. This study was approved by the Human Subjects Committees at the Connecticut VA Healthcare System and Yale University. Patients were recruited from community mental health centers, outpatient services of the Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System in West Haven, and outpatient services of the Connecticut Mental Health Center in New Haven. All patients were interviewed by a clinical psychologist or a clinically trained research assistant using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID; ( ). Patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia were included in this analysis. Patients were excluded if they met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol or drug abuse within 30\u202fdays prior to the study. Patients and control participants were excluded for significant head injury, neurological disorders, or other medical illnesses compromising the central nervous system. Symptoms were rated using the positive and negative symptom scale (PANSS; ( ). Control participants were recruited by newspaper advertisements and word-of-mouth, screened by telephone using questions from the SCID non-patient screening module, and excluded for any history of Axis I psychiatric illness. \n\n\n### Task and behavior \n  \nWe used the same picture\u2013word verification task ( ) utilized in the prior publication of ERP data pertaining to this dataset ( ) for both ERP and fMRI recording sessions ( A). In this task, a simple line drawing of an object is presented (250\u202fms), and following a short delay (75\u202fms), a word appears. Subjects are instructed to respond by indicating whether the word was a semantic match (50% of trials) or non-match (unmatched, 50% of trials) to the preceding picture. Pictures consisted of 102 line drawings selected from ( ) and classified into 10 natural categories (clothing, animal, bird, appliance, tool, vehicle, vegetable, fruit, toy, and musical instrument). The full set of pictures comprised a block of 102 trials which was repeated across a total of four blocks, with the order of pictures varying across blocks. Half of the unmatched trials comprised picture-word pairs from a related semantic category (related co-hyponym, e.g., APPLE \u2192lemon) and the other half comprised picture-word pairs from unrelated semantic categories (unrelated, e.g., APPLE \u2192cow). Subjects were not asked to distinguish between related and unrelated unmatched target words. Occasional null events were inserted between trials, resulting in trial-to-trial intervals that ranged from 3 to 11\u202fs. Participants responded by button press with right or left index fingers to indicate if the word matched or did not match the picture. Left / right button presses were counterbalanced across participants. All participants performed several practice trials prior to ERP or fMRI recordings. No feedback was given to signal performance accuracy and participants were told to respond as quickly as possible without sacrificing accuracy. All subjects performed the task at >90% accuracy (See Supplementary Table 1. HC\u202f=\u202f95.0% and SZ\u202f=\u202f91.8%, F(1,45)\u202f=\u202f5.7295,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.02). We found no effect of practice across the two sessions, performance accuracy was similar for the first and second session across groups (paired   t  -test, t-stat\u202f=\u202f\u22120.70,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.49) and remained insignificant after controlling for the time difference between sessions (p\u202f=\u202f0.49). Moreover, there was no effect of session order or time between sessions on the loading weight of the joint component reported below (ANCOVA model with covariates of group, session order and times between sessions). Reaction latency data were collected, and the median reaction times per subject, per condition (matched, unmatched) was determined (see Supplementary Methods and Results). All participants showed slower reaction times during the fMRI session than EEG session (see Supplementary Fig. 1) without higher level interaction effects between Group (HC or SZ) or Session (EEG or fMRI).   \nA. The visual stimuli and behavioral paradigm used in these studies. In the priming task, participants indicated whether a word was a semantic match or non-match (unmatched) relative to the preceding picture. In this task, a simple line drawing of an object is presented (250\u202fms), and following a short delay (75\u202fms), a word appears. Half of the non-match trials comprised picture-word pairs from a related semantic category (e.g., banana-lemon) and the other half comprising picture-word pairs from OC semantic categories (e.g., banana-cow). Subjects performed a 2-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) to indicate whether the word was a semantic match (50% of trials) or non-match (50% of trials) to the preceding picture. B. Average N400 ERP difference waves (unmatched minus matched) for IC, left, and OC, right, shown as a grand average across groups (solid black) and as back-projected waveforms for each component (component #1 solid blue; component #2 dashed blue). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n### EEG acquisition \n  \nData acquisition is as described in ( ), to summarize briefly: EEG data were digitized using a 1000\u202fHz sampling rate, low pass filtered at 100\u202fHz, and high pass filtered at 0.05\u202fHz. Data were acquired from F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, O1, Oz, and O2. Data were referenced to linked ears. Additional electrodes were place on the outer canthi of both eyes and above and below the left eye to record eye movements and blinks (vertical and horizontal electro-oculogram (EOG); VEOG, HEOG). All impedances were maintained at or below 10 k\u03a9 throughout the recording session with most EEG sites around 5 k\u03a9. \n\n\n### EEG processing \n  \nContinuous EEG Data were bandpass filtered between 1 and 30\u202fHz, epoched and stimulus-locked to picture onset. Individual trials were baseline corrected using the 100\u202fms period preceding picture onset after correcting for eye movements and blinks using EOG data ( ). Trials containing artifacts (voltages exceeding \u00b1100\u202f\u03bcV) were rejected. Only data from correct trials were included in the analyses. N400 difference waveforms were derived on a subject-by-subject basis by subtracting matched trial averages from the two unmatched conditions (related and unrelated). The resulting difference waveforms from electrode Cz (electrode with maximal N400 magnitude) were used for Joint Independent Component Analysis (see details below). \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition, preprocessing and analysis \n  \nStructural and functional MRI data were collected using a 3T Siemens Trio scanner. The structural imaging protocol was a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) T1-weighted high-resolution image (2530\u202fms TR, 3.66\u202fms TE, 1\u202fmm slice thickness, 256\u202fmm field of view, 1.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.0 voxel size, flip angle 7\u00b0, sagittal orientation, 8:07\u202fmin). The fMRI protocol was an AC-PC aligned echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (2000\u202fms TR, 28\u202fms TE, flip angle 60\u00b0, 33 slices collected sequentially in ascending order with a 12% (0.5\u202fmm) gap, 4.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f4.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f4.0\u202fmm voxel size, 257 frames, 8:34\u202fmin per run). \n\nPreprocessing of fMRI images was done using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8;  ). Motion correction was performed via affine registration, where the first image of each run was realigned to the first image of the first run, followed by re-alignment within each run. Next, Images were slice-time corrected with respect to the middle slice. We implemented aCompCor (anatomic component-based noise correction,  ), a principal components-based approach for noise reduction of fMRI time-series data. Given that aCompCor uses white matter and CSF regions identified from FreeSurfer anatomical segmentation of T1 images ( ) to identify noise components, five participants were excluded (3 HCs and 2 SZs) due to excessive head motion or scanning artifacts as determined by manual examination of FreeSurfer reconstructions. \n\nFirst-level modeling of the fMRI data was performed using an event-related analysis aligned to the onset of the picture. SPM's canonical hemodynamic response function (a double gamma function) was convolved with task event vectors to create a first-level task regressor representing the predicted response of a voxel activated by visual onset of the picture. A high pass temporal filter (128\u202fs cut-off) was applied to remove low-frequency noise and a general linear model was implemented voxel-wise, regressing each voxel's time series on the task regressor, as well as on nuisance regressors consisting of the aCompCor noise components. The time of correct or incorrect button presses were modeled and included as nuisance regressors during the denoising step. Beta coefficients representing the fit of the task regressor to a voxel's time series were estimated, to generate beta images for the 3 conditions of interest (matched, OC unmatched and IC unmatched) versus implicit baseline (null time). Mean beta images across runs were normalized by applying the spatial transformation matrix derived from normalization of the mean functional image (generated during motion correction) to the Montreal Neurological Institute's EPI template ( ) ( ). Normalized beta images were resliced to 3\u202fmm  isotropic voxel dimensions using a fourth degree B-spline and were then spatially smoothed with an 8\u202fmm full-width-half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Subsequently, each subject's first-level analysis brain mask image was normalized and applied to the smoothed beta image to mask out regions with insufficient signal intensity, as determined by SPM during first level modeling. The resulting first-level model contrast images were utilized in the JICA, see below. We report the results of a second-level general linear model (GLM) in the supplementary material. \n\n\n### Joint independent component analysis of EEG and fMRI data \n  \nTo identify anatomical regions linked to the N400 component, we conducted a joint independent component analysis (JICA) using the Matlab-based Fusion ICA Toolbox or \u201cFIT\u201d (Rachakonda, Liu, and Calhoun 2008;  ). We entered each subject's N400 difference waves and first-level model contrast images for the two conditions of interest: IC versus matched and OC versus matched. These two conditions formed two \u201cfeatures\u201d within the JICA analysis, so were concatenated side-by-side for a total of four \u201cfeatures:\u201d (1) OC versus matched ERPs, (2) OC versus matched fMRI, (3) IC versus matched ERPs, (4) OC versus matched fMRI. The ERP waveforms are upsampled by a factor of 121 so that the number of samples in time match the number of fMRI samples in space. The use of difference waves, instead of condition grand averages as reported previously ( ) resulted in similar statistical effects: N400 difference waves which are larger for OC and reduced in SZ (Supplementary Fig. 2; main effect of group, F(1,47)\u202f=\u202f15.36,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.0003; main effect of condition, F(1,47)\u202f=\u202f217.22,   p  \u202f<\u202f0.00001; group x condition, F(1,47)\u202f=\u202f14.22,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.0004). \n\nBriefly, the JICA algorithm utilizes temporal information in the ERPs and spatial information in the fMRI to look for inter-subject covariation and identify \u201cfused\u201d ERP-fMRI components which maximize the joint likelihood function. This approach identifies \u201cfeatures\u201d which covary the same way across participants. The algorithm outputs loading weights for each subject, which reflect the magnitude of the joint component for that particular subject (the coefficients of the unmixing matrix). Loading scores were compared between groups using independent samples   t  -tests. Loading weights can be used to \u201cback-project\u201d temporal and spatial maps for each feature: in our case, one spatial map and time course for the IC vs. match condition and one spatial map and time courses for the OC vs. match condition. A priori, we planned to investigate components with time courses that correlated with the N400 and regressed those time courses onto the N400 grand average ERP to assist with component selection. We estimated the number of components to calculate based on minimum descriptive length criteria for fMRI ( ) and a parallel test for ERP ( ) for each feature. Given the primacy of our interest in identifying a joint component that clearly captured the N400 difference wave in the ERP waveforms, we considered ICA solutions involving extractions of between 2 and 7 components. After reviewing the components resulting from these solutions, it was clear that the 2-component solution yielded a joint component that clearly captured the N400 difference waveform for both IC and OC conditions (IC condition: R \u202f=\u202f0.924,   p  \u202f<\u202f0.0001, OC condition: R \u202f=\u202f0.944, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). Accordingly, this joint component was extracted and used in our subsequent analyses. \n\nGiven our interest in identifying regions correlated with the N400, we focused our follow-up analyses on voxels with a positive correlation with the N400. Spatial maps were subject to thresholding at Z\u202f>\u202f4.42 (  p  \u202f<\u202f0.000005) and convolved with the FSL-Harvard Standard Atlas ( ). All voxels in the brain contribute to the loading weight; empirical thresholding identifies regions that are most strongly linked to the N400 magnitude. In our analyses, the maps revealed a max z-score of ~8 for the OC map and max z-score of ~10 for the IC map, so we selected a z-score cutoff that approximated half of the height of the average maximum for the two maps (Z\u202f>\u202f4.42). Threshold free maps are also available on neurovault ( ). All clusters larger than 18 voxels (the minimum ROI size in the FSL-Harvard Standard Atlas) were included and labeled according to the regional area that composed the majority of the voxels for that cluster. \n\n\n### Clinical correlations \n  \nWe conducted correlations between activity (contrast estimates) extracted from z-thresholded IC and OC JICA spatial maps with clinical measures. We predicted that clinical deficits in language function (as reflected in scores on thought process and content) in SZ patients would be related to reductions of activity in conceptual networks (inverse correlation between activity and impairment). We extracted conceptual disorganization (P2) and unusual thought content (G9) from the PANSS ratings. Given the correlation between disorganization and content (  r  \u202f=\u202f0.69,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.0002) we conducted multivariate regression analysis to look for independent effects of process and content ( ). To examine the distribution of symptom correlations within the thresholded JICA maps, conceptual disorganization and unusual thought content PANSS ratings were entered as predictors in a GLM analysis in SPM separately for the IC minus matched and OC minus matched contrasts of interest. We used inclusive masks from the corresponding JICA z-thresholded spatial maps (one for each condition) to restrict whole brain T-maps for visualizing the distributions of relationships between contrast images and PANSS ratings. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Joint independent component analysis (JICA) \n  \nSubject level data from fMRI first-level contrasts and ERP N400 difference waves (OC minus matched and IC minus matched) were utilized for JICA (see methods for details) to examine the two priming conditions of interest, OC and IC. A single JICA component (#1) captured the N400 difference waveform for both conditions (IC and OC,  B). This component also revealed a pronounced reduction in loading weights for SZ participants (t-stat\u202f=\u202f3.3047,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.0018). In an ANCOVA model, controlling for age, there was no effect of age on the component loading weights (t-stat\u202f=\u202f\u22121.29,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.21) and the group effect remained significant (t-stat\u202f=\u202f\u22122.803,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.007). \n\nTwo fMRI whole brain maps show the ICA spatial weights (expressed as z-scores) for the IC and OC condition contrasts (each relative to the matched condition) associated with this JICA component (see  ). These maps represent a wide range of modeled hemodynamic activations evoked during IC and OC task conditions and show the degree to which they are linked to the N400 difference wave (max z-score of ~8 for the OC map, and max z-score of ~10 for the IC map). In order to isolate the brain regions with the strongest links to N400 for additional analyses, the ICA spatial maps were thresholded (Z\u202f>\u202f4.42, see methods). The resulting brain regions, with their peaks, corresponding to the voxels with the strongest contribution to the N400 joint component, are shown in  . The thresholded IC and OC spatial maps appeared to be quite distinct, overlapping by only 3 voxels in the L anterior temporal pole: The IC map included midline cingulate areas, cerebellum, the precuneus and posterior cingulate as well as the bilateral anterior temporal pole, while the OC map included occipital visual areas near the lingual gyrus, the right superior parietal lobule and the left anterior temporal pole.   \n Z  -scored spatial maps for the joint component during the unmatched, IC (left) and OC (right) conditions.

Unusual thought content (while controlling for conceptual disorganization) was inversely correlated with extracted contrast values from the IC map ( A,   r  \u202f=\u202f\u22120.54,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.006) and the OC map (  r  \u202f=\u202f\u22120.42,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.047). This correlation held across a range of   Z  -thresholds (z\u202f=\u202f2 to z\u202f=\u202f6) for the component maps (test for homogeneity among correlated correlation coefficients ( ) indicated no correlation coefficient was significantly different from the others; all p's\u202f>\u202f0.57). This correlation appeared to reflect distributed activity from across the spatial maps ( B). Conceptual disorganization (controlling for unusual thought content) did not correlate with contrast values from either map (both p's\u202f>\u202f0.2). We did not find a correlation between unusual thought content or disorganization with N400 amplitude in the IC or OC conditions (all p's\u202f>\u202f0.500). In addition, there was no significant correlation between unusual thought content and age(  r  \u202f=\u202f0.06,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.78), education (  r  \u202f=\u202f\u22120.21,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.34) or parental SES (  r  \u202f=\u202f\u22120.33,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.11). Thus, the hemodynamic response from voxels linked to the N400, but not ERP amplitudes themselves, inversely correlates with unusual thought content.   \nA.

T-maps of the relationship between the OC vs matched (left) and IC vs matched (right) and unusual thought content (controlling for disorganization). Views of the brain are the same as in  . \n  Fig. 3   \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe principle finding of this study is that JICA captured the N400 waveform with a component linked to activity in a distributed conceptual network which includes unimodal visual as well as transmodal areas ( ). Loading weights for this ERP-fMRI \u201cfused\u201d component were reduced in SZ. Hemodynamic activity in these networks was negatively correlated with unusual thought content in SZ when controlling for conceptual disorganization. \n\n### Neuroanatomy associated with N400 \n  \nWe hypothesized that a distributed network of language areas, rather than a focal brain region, might underlie the N400 ERP. The JICA approach measures covariation, so we cannot infer causality regarding underlying ERP generators or dipole localization. It is possible that the N400 generators (which are not captured by fMRI) are in fact associated with the component map. Additional generators may mediate the relationship between the N400 response and the areas captured by the JICA. Neural generators might be associated with a distributed network even if source localization procedures map the ERP to a focal site, as is suggested by dynamic causal modeling of ERP data ( ). Alternatively, the generators themselves may be distributed intracranial sources ( ;  ), given that not all cortical currents are revealed in EEG and MEG, potentially owing to effects of cancellation ( ;  ). Lastly, the JICA approach employs neural data to improve the identification of hemodynamic spatial information, which are likely to reflect different neuronal computations than ERPs ( ;  ). We agree with  , that regarding the functional localization of the N400: \u201c...the question becomes not where is the N400 generator localized, or whether there are multiple N400s, but rather what are the functions of the dynamic neural system of which scalp N400s are reflections?\u201d Our results suggest that the N400 reflects dynamic networks which are flexibly engaged depending on context. \n\n\n### IN category versus OUT of category \n  \nWe find that the anatomy of hemodynamic activity linked to the N400 depends on conceptual relatedness. For related stimuli (IC), peak activity is seen in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, the bilateral temporal poles, as well as cerebellar regions. Whereas for unrelated stimuli (OC), peak activity is linked primarily to visual cortex and the left temporal pole. There are some similarities between IC and OC spatial maps: N400 responses are linked to activity in the temporal poles, although with some differences in magnitude and laterality. Activity in the temporal poles corresponds to a meta-analysis of fMRI studies of conceptual knowledge ( ) and atrophy linked to impaired object recognition in progressive primary aphasia ( ). \n\nIC and OC spatial maps are most notable for their differences. For IC trials, pronounced peaks of activity are seen in midline cortical structures, including the cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the precuneus. The posterior cingulate and precuneus are highly metabolically active regions which are principle hubs for the default mode network ( ), but also a semantic network ( ). We interpret activity within these areas as mediating the task demands of distinguishing between conceptually related objects, a process similar to semantic interference ( ). Our findings are in apparent contrast with prior studies which found suppression of ACC or PCC activity for IC versus OC words ( ;  ;  ). Notably, these studies employed naming or lexical decision tasks, rather than a matching task, as we did. This distinction may be crucial as there is evidence for differential loci of semantic interference for word-picture   naming   tasks relative to word-picture   matching   tasks ( ). Furthermore, matching tasks may show more robust priming effects than lexical decision tasks ( ) perhaps owing to effects of prediction ( ). Lastly, our finding linking activity in cerebellum to IC N400 responses was somewhat surprising. The role of the cerebellum in mediating semantic association has been probed with TMS, but effects were not specific to categorization ( ). The specificity of cerebellar activity linked to the IC condition warrants further investigation. \n\nWith the possible exception of the temporal pole, regions linked to IC and OC N400 responses are somewhat at odds with our initial hypothesis of an N400 language network identified by ( ). As noted above, this may reflect our use of a matching task, rather than a naming task. Moreover, our use of picture primes, rather than words, recruits distinct superior occipital networks ( ). The OC spatial map reveals activity in visual occipital areas, in addition to the temporal pole. Our use of contrast estimates in the JICA suggests that activity in visual areas is related to the violation of semantic expectations, rather than purely reflecting the visual nature of the task. Visual cortex activation is consistent with semantic models of \u201cembodied abstraction\u201d in which perceptual networks are recruited in language tasks during novel or unexpected contexts ( ). This is similar to models of predictive coding, where deviations in expectancy lead to increased responses from unimodal perceptual areas ( ). Our results are consistent with other findings of flexible recruitment of visual areas within conceptual networks ( ). \n\n\n### Diminished activation in schizophrenia linked to unusual thought content \n  \nIn SZ we find that hemodynamic activity from the IC network (and less so, the OC network) is inversely correlated with unusual thought content (while controlling for disorganization). This finding is distinct from other studies which related   larger   N400 amplitude to delusions ( ) and   reduced   N400 amplitude to formal thought disorder ( ). Notably, these studies report associations with N400 amplitude, which we did not find. This may relate to differences in the priming task (matching, or lexical decision) and stimulus type (words versus pictures). The posterior cingulate / precuneus is hyperconnected in schizophrenia, with hyperconnectivity correlating with composite measures of psychopathology ( ). Hyperconnectivity in the PCC might undermine attentional resources during cognition, destabilizing the balance between internal (often semantic) and externally directed processing ( ). Deficient activity in the PCC during externally triggered semantic violations, as we observe, may reflect an inability in SZ to balance external attention to the semantic violation with internally oriented semantic memory. This imbalance might attribute excessive internal (self-referential or idiosyncratic) meaning to external objects, contributing to unusual thought content. Impairments in a distributed network, that includes visual and transmodal integrative centers, point toward semantic impairment in SZ at the level of semiosis: a sign process mediating internal interpretation of external objects ( ). Not merely being a disorder of language per se, unusually broad semantic networks in SZ may fundamentally reflect disordered relations between external objects and inner representations, leading to unusual linguistic content. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nA primary limitation of this study was that ERP and fMRI data were acquired from separate recording sessions. Repetition of the same paradigm could have introduced practice effects into the N400 response, which is otherwise highly reliable ( ). We suspect that repetition had a minimal effect on our findings, given that there was no effect of session order or time between sessions on the loading weight of the joint component. Furthermore, we found that performance accuracy was similar between EEG and fMRI recording sessions, the first and second session, and was not associated with the time between sessions. Future studies might benefit from concurrent recordings to rule-out practice or repetition effects, but with caution given the recording and analytic challenges introduced by simultaneous EEG-fMRI methods ( ;  ). \n\nAn additional limitation of this study was that the JICA approach explicitly excludes spatial information from the ERP data and temporal information from the fMRI data. Instead, the JICA approach leverages the temporal precision of ERPs and the spatial precision of fMRI. There is pronounced similarity between IC and OC ERP waveforms and striking dissimilarity between IC and OC spatial maps. This finding raises the question of how similar voltage fluctuations are associated with distinct hemodynamic maps. We note that despite similar waveform morphology, N400   amplitudes   do distinguish IN and OUT category stimuli (see Methods and Supplemental Fig. 2) as we reported previously ( ). In addition, the N400 shows consistency in timing across a wide range of stimulus modalities and features ( ). Our findings suggest that the voltage time course of activation linked to these networks is remarkably similar, despite differences in spatial anatomy derived from a sluggish hemodynamic response. Although hemodynamic signals are typically considered as a surrogate for neural activity, they directly reflect vascular and metabolic activity that may be dissociated or partially uncoupled from neural activity ( ;  ). Cardiovascular signals interact with ongoing neural activity to influence semantic representations ( ), so we cannot exclude the possibility that hemodynamic activity reflects embodied signals relevant to semantic processing that are distinct from neural signals. Future studies might employ concurrent EEG-fMRI or EEG source localization techniques to compare anatomy linked to voltage fluctuations with anatomy linked to hemodynamic changes. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6699247, "text_md5": "1e142cd51d7ed0b40dfa34f524abc78f", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 103], "journal": [104, 119], "publication_year": [121, 125], "title": [136, 238], "keywords": [252, 303], "abstract": [316, 2976], "body": [2985, 35864]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 31398555, "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101960", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6699247", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6699247"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6699247\">6699247</a>", "list_title": "PMC6699247  Aberrant activity in conceptual networks underlies N400 deficits and unusual thoughts in schizophrenia"}
{"text": "Yi, Kyongmyon and Heo, Juyeon and Hong, Jiyun and Kim, Chobok\nSci Rep, 2022\n\n# Title\n\nThe role of the right prefrontal cortex in the retrieval of weak representations\n\n# Keywords\n\nHuman behaviour\nPsychology\nCognitive neuroscience\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nAlthough recent studies have shown the importance of control in creative problem solving, the neural mechanisms of control processes engaged in retrieval of weak representations, which is closely linked to creative problem solving, remain unclear. The current study aimed to examine the neural mechanisms associated with retrieval of weak representations using functional magnetic resonance imaging and their potential relationships with creativity task performance. For this purpose, participants performed an experimental task that enabled us to directly compare between retrieval of previously unattended-and-weak representations and attended-and-strong representations. Imaging results indicated that the right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (aDLPFC) was selectively engaged in retrieval of weak representations. Moreover, the right aDLPFC activations were positively correlated with individuals\u2019 creativity task performance but independent of attention-demanding task performance. We therefore suggest that the right aDLPFC plays a key role in retrieval of weak representations and may support creative problem solving. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPrevious studies have emphasized the contribution of linking between weakly-associated representations in memory to generate creative ideas for solving problems . According to a traditional account of creative processes , generating creative ideas can be best understood as a spreading activation of memory representations that are interconnected within a distributed semantic network of long-term memory (LTM), suggesting that retrieving one concept in memory diffusely activates other connected concepts . Accordingly, this phenomenon would explain the passive retrieval of weakly-associated representations in memory. For example, strongly-associated representations for a given concept (e.g., \u201ccandle\u201d and \u201cflame\u201d) are immediately retrieved into working memory (WM), whereas weakly-associated representations (e.g., \u201ccandle\u201d and \u201chalo\u201d) become more slowly available in WM . \n\nHowever, accumulative evidence suggests the importance of top-down control in creative idea generation . For example, behavioral studies demonstrated that individuals with higher control abilities can generate creative responses earlier than those with lower abilities . Further, neuroimaging studies reported neural correlates in frontal regions, including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and frontopolar cortex, suggesting that these regions are associated with controlled semantic retrieval , inhibition of strongly-associated representations , or semantic processing of weakly-associated representations . In addition, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) are thought to be engaged in WM functions during creativity tasks, such as active maintenance and monitoring of goal-related representations . \n\nAlthough several brain regions have been suggested to be involved in control processes during creative idea generation, the underlying neural mechanisms of control processes involved in retrieving weakly-associated representations still remains unclear. Indeed, identifying direct evidence of these mechanisms remains challenging in an experimental setting. This difficulty arises given that a direct comparison between the control processes engaged in retrieving weakly- and strongly-associated representations to WM requires the prerequisite that participants retrieve the given representations from their semantic memory with the same representational strength for both weak and strong associations. However, the strength for any given representations is largely obscured across individuals  because semantic networks in their LTM substantially vary with their own experience and knowledge , which imposes constraints on experimental manipulation of representations in LTM. \n\nOne promising method that may overcome this challenge involves assessing how weak representations (i.e., those with low representational strength) are retrieved from WM, rather than how weakly-associated representations are retrieved from LTM. One rationale is that the retrieval operations that act upon WM and LTM share common processes , as suggested by the state-based WM models . Another rationale is that the activation levels of WM representations can be determined by attentional modulation during the encoding processes: (1) Focused items relative to unfocused items remain strengthened in WM, thereby remaining easily accessible  and (2) Neural responses are greater for focused items compared to ignored items . In this context, the representational strength can be manipulated according to whether the stimuli being retrieved into WM were previously related to focused or ignored items. Accordingly, it is possible to investigate neural mechanisms of the control processes engaged in the retrieval of weak representations (\u201cretrieval of weak representations\u201d or RWR) with low representational strength, compared to strong representations with high representational strength. \n\nIn the present study, we aimed to reveal the neural mechanisms of control processes underlying the retrieval of weak representations. To this end, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment to compare the retrieval processes for previously ignored stimuli (i.e., retrieval of weak representations, or RWR) with those of previously attended stimuli (i.e., retrieval of strong representations). To manipulate the weak or strong representations to be retrieved into WM, we designed a task paradigm including a 2-back updating task (2Back), which appeared after a classification task (Classification), with numbers or letters: retrieval of a strong representation involved presenting a number (or a letter) during the 2Back trials after performing consecutive number (or letter) Classification trials; retrieval of a weak representation involved presenting a number (or a letter) during the 2Back trials after performing sequential letter (or number) Classification trials (Fig.\u00a0 ). Importantly, the number and letter stimuli were superimposed onto each other during the Classification trials in order to ensure that focusing on a number or letter stimulus resulted in ignoring the other.   \nTask stimuli and conditions used in the experiment. For red stimuli, the task required participants to classify the stimuli as odd/even or vowel/consonant according to whether the current red target was a number or letter, respectively (i.e., the classification task). When the stimulus color was changed to green, participants were required to determine whether the current target in green was identical to the stimulus that was presented in red or in gray two trials before.   RP   repeat,   SWr   switch-relevant,   SWi   switch-irrelevant. \n  \n\nAdditionally, we administered the Alternate Uses Test (AUT) as well as the flanker and response switch tasks to identify whether participants\u2019 neural responses during RWR are related to their behavioral performance in a creativity task and/or attention-demanding tasks. However, it should be noted that these brain\u2013behavior correlation analyses were nonindependent (i.e., neural responses resulted from significantly activated regions in voxel-wise analyses) . \n\nFinally, we took several factors into consideration to examine RWR-specific neural mechanisms within an experimental setting. First, since the task requires switching from external stimuli during the Classification trials to internal representations, which were presented two trials earlier regardless of their intensities, and then comparing the internal representations with the current stimulus in the current 2Back trial, brain activations related to switching from external stimuli to internal representations must be differentiated from RWR-related activations. Second, it is important to exclude any activation associated with consecutive repeating 2Back trials. With this experimental design and criteria, we examined the brain regions specifically associated with the processing of previously ignored representations into WM, i.e., RWR. We expected that cortical regions associated with RWR would be subregions of the lateral prefrontal cortex, which are known to be responsible for attentional control . \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nThe experimental design was a two-way within-subject design. The first factor (Task) was composed of 2-back updating task (2Back) and classification task (Classification) conditions. The second factor (Switch-type) consisted of three conditions: trials that were required to switch from one task to the other and the stimulus domain was previously task-relevant (SWr) or previously task-irrelevant (SWi), and trials that were repeated within the same task and stimulus domain as the previous trial (RP) (for details, see \u201c \u201d). \n\nMean accuracy and RTs were analyzed in the context of a 2 (Task: 2Back and Classification)\u2009\u00d7\u20093 (Switch-type: SWr, SWi, and RP) repeated-measures ANOVA. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 A, for accuracy, the main effect of Task was significant [F(1,29)\u2009=\u2009130.283,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05,   = 0.818] due to higher accuracy in Classification than 2Back. The main effect of Switch-type was also significant [F(2,58)\u2009=\u200928.255,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05,   = 0.493] due to the accuracy of RP being higher than that of both SWr [  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% CI (0.032, 0.085)] and SWi [  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% CI (0.055, 0.116)] with no significant difference observed between SWr and SWi [  p  \u2009=\u20090.120, 95% CI (\u2212\u00a00.005, 0.059)]. In addition, the interaction between Task and Switch-type was significant [F(2,58)\u2009=\u200910.548,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05,   = 0.267] due to the accuracy of 2Back-RP being higher than that of 2Back-SWr [t(29)\u2009=\u20093.696,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, Cohen\u2019s   d   (  d  )\u2009=\u20090.670, 95% CI (0.030, 0.105)] while that of 2Back-SWr was higher than that of 2Back-SWi [t(29)\u2009=\u20093.007,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05,   d  \u2009=\u20090.642, 95% CI (0.025, 0.133)]; however, the accuracy of Classification-RP was higher than that of both Classification-SWr [t(29)\u2009=\u20094.472,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05,   d  \u2009=\u20090.800, 95% CI (0.027, 0.072)] and Classification-SWi [t(29)\u2009=\u20092.391,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05,   d  \u2009=\u20090.406, 95% CI (0.004, 0.045)] with no significant difference observed between Classification-SWr and Classification-SWi [t(29)\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a01.900,   p  \u2009=\u20090.067,   d  \u2009=\u20090.328, 95% CI (\u2212\u00a00.053, 0.002)].   \nBehavioral results. Mean (  A  ) accuracy and (  B  ) reaction times for each experimental condition. The   post-hoc   pairwise comparisons were tested using paired simples t-tests based on significant interactions. Error bars indicate the standard error of the means.   RP   repeat,   SWr   switch-relevant,   SWi   switch-irrelevant. \n  \n\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a0 B, RT analysis indicated that the main effect of Switch-type was significant [F(2,58)\u2009=\u200942.893,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05,   = 0.597], which is attributable to faster RTs for RP than those of SWr [  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% CI (\u2212\u00a0288, \u2212\u00a0133)] and SWi [  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% CI (\u2212\u00a0310, \u2212\u00a0150)] with no significant difference observed between SWr and SWi [  p  \u2009=\u20090.911, 95% CI (\u2212\u00a067, 28)]. However, the main effect of Task [F(1,29)\u2009=\u20093.210,   p  \u2009=\u20090.084,   = 0.100, 95% CI (\u2212\u00a07, 118)] and the interaction between Task and Switch-type were not significant [F(2,58)\u2009=\u20093.055,   p  \u2009=\u20090.055,   = 0.095]. \n\nGiven that the participants were native Korean speakers, there was a possibility that performances between tasks with letters (i.e., those with English consonants and vowels) and numbers would differ. To address this possibility, the mean accuracies and RTs between number and letter trials in 2Back and Classification conditions were analyzed using paired samples t-tests. Results showed that there were no significant differences in accuracy between the number (M\u2009=\u20090.856, SD\u2009=\u20090.078) and letter trials (M\u2009=\u20090.860, SD\u2009=\u20090.071) [t(29)\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.564,   p  \u2009=\u20090.577,   d  \u2009=\u20090.063, 95% CI (\u2212\u00a00.021, 0.012)] nor in RTs between the number (M\u2009=\u20091,248\u00a0ms, SD\u2009=\u2009175) and letter trials (M\u2009=\u20091,255\u00a0ms, SD\u2009=\u2009163) [t(29)\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.475,   p  \u2009=\u20090.638,   d  \u2009=\u20090.042, 95% CI (\u2212\u00a038, 24)]. These results show that the usage of English letters in our task did not cause problems to native Korean speaking participants. \n\n\n### Imaging results \n  \nFunctional imaging data were first examined to identify RWR-related brain regions via the interaction contrast [i.e., (2Back-SWi\u20132Back-SWr)\u2009>\u2009(Classification-SWi\u2013Classification-SWr)] in the context of whole-brain analysis. Initial results showed significant activations in distinct clusters in the frontal area including the right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (aDLPFC) (BA 46), posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (pDLPFC) (BA 46), and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) (BA 8/32) (Table   and Fig.\u00a0 A,B). To verify RWR-specific cortical regions among the aforementioned frontal regions, we applied exclusive masking with the simple effects of both WM updating (i.e., 2Back-RP\u2009>\u2009Classification-RP) (Supplementary Fig.  A) and switching (i.e., 2Back-SW\u2009>\u20092Back-RP) (Table   and Supplementary Fig.  B).

Percent signal changes (PSCs) extracted from these ROIs were compared between 2Back-SWi and 2Back-SWr, and between Classification-SWi and Classification-SWr. Among the regions, only the right aDLPFC showed RWR-specific activations. In detail, the PSCs of 2Back-SWi (M\u2009=\u20090.196, SD\u2009=\u20090.367) were higher than those of 2Back-SWr (M\u2009=\u20090.015, SD\u2009=\u20090.436) [t(29)\u2009=\u20092.363,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05,   d  \u2009=\u20090.448, 95% CI (0.024, 0.338)], while there was no difference between Classification-SWi (M\u2009=\u20090.144, SD\u2009=\u20090.335) and Classification-SWr (M\u2009=\u20090.131, SD\u2009=\u20090.347) [t(29)\u2009=\u20090.228,   p  \u2009=\u20090.821,   d  \u2009=\u20090.036, 95% CI (\u2212\u00a00.098, 0.123)]. In addition, the PSCs of 2Back-SWi were marginally higher than those of 2Back-RP (M\u2009=\u20090.091, SD\u2009=\u20090.274) but not at a significant level [t(29)\u2009=\u20091.788,   p  \u2009=\u20090.084,   d  \u2009=\u20090.324, 95% CI (\u2212\u00a00.015, 0.225)]. The pDLPFC showed no difference between 2Back-SWr (M\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.024, SD\u2009=\u20090.219) and 2Back-SWi (M\u2009=\u20090.007, SD\u2009=\u20090.227) [t(29)\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.970,   p  \u2009=\u20090.340,   d  \u2009=\u20090.150, 95% CI (\u2212\u00a00.099, 0.035)], whereas Classification-SWr (M\u2009=\u20090.032, SD\u2009=\u20090.199) and Classification-SWi (M\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.031 SD\u2009=\u20090.205) were marginally but not significantly different [t(29)\u2009=\u20091.721,   p  \u2009=\u20090.096,   d  \u2009=\u20090.313, 95% CI (\u2212\u00a00.012, 0.137)]. Similarly, for the dmPFC, the PSCs of Classification-SWr (M\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.020, SD\u2009=\u20090.182) were higher than those of Classification-SWi (M\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.108, SD\u2009=\u20090.185) [t(29)\u2009=\u20092.979,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05,   d  \u2009=\u20090.482, 95% CI (0.027, 0.148)], but there was no difference between 2Back-SWr (M\u2009=\u20090.004, SD\u2009=\u20090.251) and 2Back-SWi (M\u2009=\u20090.067, SD\u2009=\u20090.310) [t(29)\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a01.467,   p  \u2009=\u20090.153,   d  \u2009=\u20090.221, 95% CI (\u2212\u00a00.151, 0.025)]. Overall, these results demonstrate that right aDLPFC activation was closely associated with RWR, in accordance with the whole-brain results. \n\nNext, based on the   post-hoc   ROI analyses, correlation analyses were conducted to identify whether the right aDLPFC activation associated with RWR was related to behavioral measurements in creativity task performance (AUT scores) and/or attentional-demanding task performance (the interference effect and switch cost). The results showed that the differences in PSCs between 2Back-SWi and 2Back-SWr was positively correlated with the total score [r\u2009=\u20090.475, corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% CI (0.139, 0.713)]. The results of AUT subscores (fluency, flexibility, and originality) showed that right aDLPFC activation was positively correlated with fluency [r\u2009=\u20090.446, corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% CI (0.102, 0.695)] and flexibility [r\u2009=\u20090.474, corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% CI (0.137, 0.713)], but unrelated to originality [r\u2009=\u20090.278, uncorrected   p  \u2009=\u20090.278, 95% CI (\u2212\u20090.091, 0.580)]. Additionally, right aDLPFC activation was unrelated to the interference effect [r\u2009=\u20090.133, uncorrected   p  \u2009=\u20090.483, 95% CI (\u2212\u20090.238, 0.470)] and switch cost [r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.004, uncorrected   p  \u2009=\u20090.981, 95% CI (\u2212\u20090.363, 0.356)]. \n\nAdditionally, functional data were analyzed to identify regions associated with the 2\u2009\u00d7\u20093 interaction [i.e., (2Back-SW\u20132Back-RP)\u2009>\u2009(Classification-SW\u2013Classification-RP)] in the context of whole-brain analysis (despite this being beyond the scope of the current study). Results showed that only the presupplementary motor area (preSMA, BA 6) was activated (Supplementary Fig.  A). Accordingly, PSCs were also extracted from this ROI and compared in a pair-wise manner between conditions (Supplementary Fig.  B). Specifically, the PSCs of 2Back-SW (M\u2009=\u20090.319, SD\u2009=\u20090.219) were higher than those of 2Back-RP (M\u2009=\u20090.206, SD\u2009=\u20090.163) [t(29)\u2009=\u20093.821,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05,   d  \u2009=\u20090.582, 95% CI (0.052, 0.173)] while those of 2Back-SWi (M\u2009=\u20090.368, SD\u2009=\u20090.237) were higher than those of 2Back-SWr (M\u2009=\u20090.270, SD\u2009=\u20090.254) [t(29)\u2009=\u20092.461,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05,   d  \u2009=\u20090.405, 95% CI (0.016, 0.181)]; however, there was no difference between Classification-SW (M\u2009=\u20090.152, SD\u2009=\u20090.185) and Classification-RP (M\u2009=\u20090.208, SD\u2009=\u20090.166) [t(29)\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a01.978,   p  \u2009=\u20090.057,   d  \u2009=\u20090.323, 95% CI (\u2212\u20090.113, 0.002)] nor between Classification-SWr (M\u2009=\u20090.151, SD\u2009=\u20090.183) and Classification-SWi (M\u2009=\u20090.153, SD\u2009=\u20090.218) [t(29)\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.078,   p  \u2009=\u20090.938,   d  \u2009=\u20090.010, 95% CI (\u2212\u20090.061, 0.056)]. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we aimed to identify the neural mechanisms of control processes underlying the retrieval of weak representations in WM (i.e., RWR). Our fMRI results indicated that only the right aDLPFC was selectively engaged in RWR. Interestingly, correlation analyses showed that right aDLPFC activation was positively correlated with the participants\u2019 creativity task performance, but that it was unrelated to attention-demanding task performance. Below, we discuss our novel findings with a focus on the functions of the right aDLPFC as well as their potential roles in creative problem solving. \n\nThree frontal regions in the right hemisphere, the aDLPFC, pDLPFC, and dmPFC, were found to be related to the interaction contrast, but only the right aDLPFC was significantly associated with RWR by exclusion of regions independently related to WM updating and attentional switching. The activation of this region was greater when retrieving previously unattended-and-weak representations in WM than when retrieving previously attended-and-strong representations, which was similar in the activation level to regions related to switching of attention toward external stimuli (i.e., Classification-SWi and Classification-SWr). Furthermore, in our   post-hoc   correlation analyses, we observed that the right aDLPFC was the only region showing a positive relation between its activation and the creativity task performance. In contrast, activation of the aDLPFC was unrelated to the attention-demanding task performance, including the interference effect and switch cost. Given that the generation of more creative responses, i.e., higher creativity task performance, involves retrieval of remote-and-weak representations in the semantic network , these   post-hoc   results may suggest that the magnitude of the control processes in retrieving weak representations in WM positively covaried with the creative level of the generated ideas. However, the results should be interpreted carefully because of a non-independent ROI selection (i.e., ROIs were selected from significant regions from the whole-brain analyses) . \n\nConsistent with our finding that the right aDLPFC is engaged in RWR, previous neuroimaging studies on creative problem solving, in which functional connectivity methods were applied, have suggested that this region is a core of control processes during creative idea generation . For example, Beaty, et al.  performed an fMRI study to identify the neural mechanisms associated with AUT, conducting a series of analyses, including multivariate pattern analysis, seed-to-voxel, and ROI-to-ROI functional connectivity analyses. They found that the right DLPFC (peak MNI: x\u2009=\u200936, y\u2009=\u200944, z\u2009=\u200920) was commonly involved in creative problem solving in interaction with other regions, including the default mode network. Similarly, Pinho, et al.  found that the right DLPFC (peak MNI: x\u2009=\u200940, y\u2009=\u200942, z\u2009=\u200929) exhibited functional connectivity with diverse regions of the default mode network during musical improvisation. Importantly, these regions are very close to the region found in the current study (peak MNI: x\u2009=\u200932, y\u2009=\u200946, z\u2009=\u200934). \n\nIt is worth noting that our results indicate the right-lateralized DLPFC is associated with RWR despite the fact that our task used verbal and numerical stimuli. According to the novelty-routinization hypothesis of hemispheric specialization , the right hemisphere is critical for processing novel situations while the left hemisphere is critical for processing established cognitive strategies and representations. Previous studies using neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches have consistently reported the importance of the right-lateralized DLPFC in creative problem solving such as ill-structured problems . In addition, there is evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation of the right DLPFC enhances creativity task performance . Although these studies do not provide specific regions selectively associated with creative problem solving, they do support our findings. \n\nAccording to their functional roles in control processes, the right aDLPFC has been distinguished from the pDLPFC. For instance, Cieslik, et al.  suggested that the anterior portion of the right DLPFC (peak MNI: x\u2009=\u200930, y\u2009=\u200943, z\u2009=\u200923) is closely related to attention processes, whereas the posterior portion (peak MNI: x\u2009=\u200937, y\u2009=\u200933, z\u2009=\u200932) is associated with stimulus processing involved in WM; this dissociation has also consistently been reported in recent imaging studies with patients . Given this functional dissociation, the right aDLPFC may play a key role in RWR via attentional control toward weak representations. Since we excluded any effects directly associated with WM updating, RWR-specific activation in the right aDLPFC would be unrelated to updating weak representations itself. Rather, the right pDLPFC would be associated with the stimulus processing involved in WM in our task. \n\nIt could be claimed that some aspects of RWR are similar to refreshing or reflective processes, i.e., redirecting attention toward a specific representation that has recently been presented ; in this context, RWR-specific activation could be regarded as refreshing. However, we presume that the right aDLPFC activation is independent of refreshing processes because WM updating, such as 2Back-RP trials in our task, already includes multiple refreshing processes including rehearsal, comparison between items, and updates of representation sets . Moreover, RWR-specific activations were obtained by excluding simple updating in the analyses. In addition, studies on refreshing processes have mainly focused on the refreshing of previously attended items by conceptual definition  and they have reported neural correlates in left-lateralized frontal regions , which differs from our results, i.e., that retrieving previously unattended items recruits the right aDLPFC. Furthermore, refreshing has been suggested to be closely related to searching items activated in WM, which is regarded as a subcomponent for active maintenance of representations within WM . \n\nWe note that the other frontal regions found in the current study might be related with functions other than RWR. First, pDLPFC and dmPFC in the right hemisphere were activated by the interaction for RWR contrast, but they overlapped with WM updating-related regions; thus, these regions showed similar activation patterns to simple updating. As previously stated, the right pDLPFC is suggested to be involved in stimulus processing in WM , which seems to be consistent across verbal and nonverbal stimuli . Additionally, the dmPFC was proposed as a core region for WM in a previous meta-analysis , and it has been associated with involvement in monitoring functions in the context of cognitive control . Second, despite being beyond the scope of the current study, our results seem to indicate a relationship between the preSMA and switching from external stimuli to internal representations. Previously, the preSMA has been continuously associated with various types of internally initiated  or covert  responses as well as intentional switching between tasks . \n\nAlthough this is the first study utilizing fMRI to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the control processes engaged in retrieving weak representations in WM, our results cannot provide direct evidence of the involvement of these neural mechanisms in creative problem solving. Therefore, future research is warranted to reveal the neural mechanisms of the control processes engaged in RWR during creative problem solving. In conclusion, we have provided the first evidence of neural mechanisms engaged in retrieving weak representations. Our results demonstrate that this process is supported by the right aDLPFC. Furthermore, the current study may provide a new experimental approach to assess the neural and/or cognitive mechanisms of creative problem solving. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nFor the current study, 37, young, healthy volunteers were recruited from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea. All participants were right-handed, native Korean speakers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and without color blindness. None of the participants reported any history of neurological or psychiatric problems. After experimental procedures were explained, participants each provided written informed consent before study participation. After the experiment, all participants were compensated for their participation. Seven participants from the initial sample were excluded due to chance-level performance on one or more experimental conditions; thus, the final sample included 30 participants (15 female, 15 male; age range\u2009=\u200918\u201333\u00a0years, mean\u2009=\u200923.2, SD\u2009=\u20093.3). The current study was approved by the Kyungpook National University Institutional Review Board and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Materials and procedures \n  \n#### fMRI experiment \n  \nWe designed a task that enabled us to measure RWR by comparing retrieval of previously ignored stimuli into WM with that of previously focused upon stimuli; it was based on a task switching paradigm comprising the 2-back updating (2Back) and classification (Classification) tasks (Fig.\u00a0 ). The stimuli for these tasks consisted of superimposed characters (approximate visual angle: 1\u00b0) comprising letters and numbers, which were presented in the middle of a screen on a black background. The letter stimuli included four consonants (D, G, H, and N) and four vowels (A, E, O, and U) while the number stimuli included four even numbers (2, 4, 6, and 8) and four odds (3, 5, 7, and 9). The target was colored red (RGB: 255, 0, 0) or green (RGB: 0, 230, 30) while the distractor was colored gray (RGB: 215, 215, 215); the target and distractor were superimposed onto each other (opacity value: 50%). The red and green stimuli were designated for the Classification and 2Back conditions, respectively, where the color of the target stimulus informed participants of the task being presented. For Classification trials, participants were asked to classify the stimuli as odd/even or vowel/consonant according to whether the current red target was a number or letter, respectively, by pressing a left or right button. For 2Back trials, participants were required to determine whether the current target was identical to the stimulus that appeared two trials before and to press a left or right button for a \u201cyes\u2019 or \u201cno\u201d response, respectively. \n\nThe task began with a Classification trial. Specifically, the participants were asked to classify the target stimuli, printed in red, based on their characteristics (i.e., odd/even or vowel/consonant). Subsequently, when the color of the target was changed to green, participants were required to perform the 2Back trials (2Back switch; 2Back-SW). In the 2Back-SW trials, participants were required to identify whether the given stimulus was identical to the one (i.e., a previous red target or gray distractor) presented two trials earlier in the Classification task. 2Back-SW trials were also divided into two types according to whether the current stimulus was presented as a task-relevant target or task-irrelevant distractor in the Classification task: one was the case when the current stimulus was presented as a task-relevant stimulus in the Classification task (2Back-SWr, e.g., the number 2Back-SW trial following successive number Classification trials), and the other was the case when the current stimulus was presented as a task-irrelevant stimulus (2Back-SWi, e.g., the number 2Back-SW trial following consecutive letter Classification trials). After the 2Back-SW trial, 2\u20134 consecutive 2Back trials were presented within the same target domain; these trials, excluding the trial directly after the 2Back-SW trial, were denoted the 2Back repeat (2Back-RP) trials. The 2Back trial directly following the 2Back-SW trials was treated as a nuisance variable because participants were still required to activate stimuli presented in Classification trials. \n\nAfter consecutive 2Back trials, the target color was changed to red again and then participants were required to perform the Classification trials (Classification switch; Classification-SW). Classification-SW trials were also divided into two types: where the target domain was relevant to the preceding 2Back trials (Classification-SWr, e.g., the number Classification-SW following number 2Back trials) and where this condition was switched (Classification-SWi, e.g., the number Classification-SW following letter 2Back trials). Subsequently, 2\u20134 Classification trials (Classification Repeat; Classification-RP) within the same target domain were presented. \n\nAccordingly, 2Back trials were divided into three conditions, namely 2Back-SWr, 2Back-SWi, and 2Back-RP, whereas Classification trials were divided into Classification-SWr, Classification-SWi, and Classification-RP conditions, in which two factors including Task (2Back and Classification) and Switch-type [switch-relevant (SWr), switch-irrelevant (SWi), and repeat (RP)] were fully crossed in a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20093 within-subject design. The experiment consisted of 480 trials divided into four runs. Each of the 2Back-SWi, 2Back-SWr, Classification-SWi, and Classification-SWr conditions included 30 trials, while the 2Back-RP and Classification-RP conditions included 120 and 180 trials, respectively. Each run began with a central fixation and followed an additional Classification trial; these were excluded from the task condition. An event-related design was employed in which the stimuli were presented for 500\u00a0ms with intertrial intervals (ITIs) of 2000\u20134000\u00a0ms (mean: 3000\u00a0ms; increased by 500\u00a0ms). Participants were instructed to respond to the task as quickly and accurately as possible with button presses using their left or right thumbs. Task programming and stimulus presentation were conducted via E-Prime 2.0. \n\n\n#### Assessment of creativity and attention-demanding task performances \n  \nParticipants were administrated AUT as a creativity task as well as arrow flanker and response switching tasks as attention-demanding tasks outside of the MRI room. These were presented in a counterbalanced manner across participants; each half of the participants performed these tasks before or after MRI scanning. For AUT, participants were instructed to generate appropriate alternative uses for three common objects (\u201cBrick,\u201d \u201cKey,\u201d and \u201cNewspaper\u201d); they recorded as many uses as possible for each item within 2\u00a0min using a paper and pen. To improve the reliability and representativeness of the AUT scores, data from a sample of 97 participants who participated in pilot behavioral and fMRI experiments were used to calculate the AUT scores. Among them, 60 participants took part in a pilot experiment to identify the optimal task configurations for fMRI experiments, including stimulus duration, inter-trial interval, and task difficulty. The fluency score was calculated by counting the number of correct solutions. The flexibility score was computed by counting the number of different solution categories. The originality score for each response was computed by dividing the percentage of the given response over the set of entire responses. The different points were then assigned to individual responses according to their percentages (<\u20091%: 2 points;\u2009<\u20095%: 1 point; and\u2009\u2265\u20095%: 0 points). The points for each of the three objects were summed and divided by the number of correct responses . In addition to the three subscores, a total score was used for a representative single index of creativity task performance . To compute the total score, principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted for 97 participants from the current fMRI study, as well as a pilot behavioral experiment (see, Supplementary Materials), before extracting the AUT scores for 30 participants from the current study. \n\nFor the arrow flanker task, a horizontal array of five white arrows in the center of the screen was presented on a black background. The middle arrow was the target while the others were non-target distractors. The arrows either pointed in the same direction (congruent trials: \u201c<\u2009<\u2009<\u2009<\u2009<\u201d or \u201c>\u2009>\u2009>\u2009>\u2009>\u201d) or opposite direction (incongruent trials: \u201c<\u2009<\u2009>\u2009<\u2009<\u201d or \u201c>\u2009>\u2009<\u2009>\u2009>\u201d). The task required participants to respond to the direction of the target with a left or right button press as quickly and accurately as possible while ignoring distractors. It consisted of 128 trials (64 congruent and 64 incongruent trials). The stimuli were presented for 500\u00a0ms with a fixation cross presented as an ITI in the middle of the screen for 2000\u00a0ms. The interference effect, which represents an individual\u2019s ability to focus their attention on an external stimulus , was measured by subtracting the mean retention times (RTs) of congruent trials from those of incongruent trials. \n\nStimuli for the response switching task consisted of four even numbers (2, 4, 6, and 8) and four odd (3, 5, 7, and 9), which were colored either green or red. Participants were asked to classify the targets as odd or even by pressing their left or right buttons, respectively, when the target color was green; their responses were then reversed when the target was red. The task included 40 switch trials and 120 repeat trials. The stimuli were presented for 500\u00a0ms with a fixation cross presented as an ITI in the middle of the screen for 2000\u00a0ms. The switch cost, which indicates individual differences in behavioral flexibility , was measured by subtracting the mean RTs of repeat trials from those of switch trials. \n\n\n\n### Imaging acquisition \n  \nfMRI images were acquired using a 3\u00a0T Siemens Magnetom Skyra system equipped with a 20-channel head coil (Medical Device Development Center at Daegu-Gyeongbuk Medical Cluster). Task stimuli were presented via MRI-compatible goggles (NordicNeuroLab Visual System, Bergen, Norway; resolution: 800\u2009\u00d7\u2009600; refresh rate: 60\u00a0Hz) mounted on the head coil. Functional images were collected using a T2*-weighted gradient echo planner image (EPI) sequence [repetition time (TR): 2,000\u00a0ms; echo time (TE): 35\u00a0ms; flip angle (FA): 80\u00b0; field of view (FOV): 224 mm ; 33 interleaved slices; voxel size: 3.5 mm ; and 217 volumes per run]. Three dummy images preceded each run to allow for magnetic stabilization and these were discarded prior to image processing. High-resolution T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) images were also acquired (TR: 2,530\u00a0ms; TE: 3.44\u00a0ms; FA: 9\u00b0; FOV: 256\u00a0mm; voxel size: 1 mm ). \n\n\n### Image preprocessing and voxel-wise analyses \n  \nImage preprocessing was conducted using standard procedures: after discarding the first three functional volumes, the temporal disparity between slices was corrected by sinc interpolation  and motion artifacts due to head motion were minimized by realigning the timing-corrected images to the first image of the first run with a six-parameter rigid body spatial transformation . These images were coregistered onto the MPRAGE image for each subject and normalized into the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) 152 template (2\u00a0mm isotropic voxels) using unified segmentation-based normalization with a 12-parameter affine and non-linear transformation . These images were then resampled to 2\u00a0mm isotropic voxels and spatially smoothed by a 6-mm full-width/half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. Finally, highpass filtering with a 128\u00a0s cutoff was applied to the images to eliminate low-frequency drifts. \n\nStatistical analyses at the subject-level were conducted via a general linear model (GLM) using a canonical hemodynamic response function with temporal and dispersion derivatives. The model design matrix for each subject included the regressors for each run of 2Back-SWi, 2Back-SWr, 2Back-RP, Classification-SWi, Classification-SWr, and Classification-RP. In addition to these regressors-of-interest, the 2Back trials that immediately followed the 2Back-SWi and Classification-SWr trials, the first trial of each run and error trials, and the six head motion parameters derived from realignment correction were entered into the design matrix as regressors-of-no-interest. The regressors were fitted to the fMRI data to produce voxel-wise beta estimates for each condition. From the subject-level model, individual contrast images were generated for six experimental conditions, including 2Back-SWi, 2Back-SWr, 2Back-RP, Classification-SWi, Classification-SWr, and Classification-RP. \n\nFor the second-level group analyses, individual contrast images corresponding to the six experimental conditions from the subject-level analyses were entered into a random effects model  with a 2 (Task: 2Back & Classification)\u2009\u00d7\u20093 (Switch-type: SWr, SWi & RP) repeated measures ANOVA using a flexible factorial analysis in SPM. The accuracy of each condition was also entered as a covariate to control for differences in task difficulty between the conditions. For all statistical analyses, the statistical threshold was set at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 and corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate at the cluster level, with an underlying voxel level of uncorrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 . \n\nWhole-brain analyses were performed to identify brain regions associated with RWR via an interaction contrast, [(2Back-SWi\u20132Back-SWr)\u2009>\u2009(Classification-SWi\u2013Classification-SWr)], which represented greater activations of task-irrelevant internal representations (i.e., 2Back-SWi\u20132Back-SWr) compared to task-irrelevant external stimuli (i.e., Classification-SWi\u2013Classification-SWr). Because the regions activated by the interaction contrast could involve greater loads of WM updating or switching, it was important to distinguish RWR-specific regions from any regions commonly involved in simple updating and switching, irrespective of RWR contrast. Accordingly, regions associated with the simple effects of WM updating, [2Back-RP\u2009>\u2009Classification-RP], and switching for the 2Back condition, [(2Back-SWi\u2009+\u20092Back-SWr)/2\u2009>\u20092Back-RP)], were specified, and these regions were then exclusively masked for the regions activated by RWR contrast. To determine the minimum cluster size for the cluster level correction (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05), statistical significance was calculated using Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 iterations) implemented in the AFNI 3dClustSim tool ( ). Consequently, clusters with a minimum of 73 contiguous voxels (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001 at the voxel level) were considered to be significant (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05). \n\nAn additional interaction was tested to differentiate RWR-specific regions from those associated with switching from Classification to 2Back trials: switching from external stimuli to internal representations regardless of their intensities was tested via a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20093 interaction (i.e., [(2Back-SWi\u2009+\u20092Back-SWr)/2\u00a0\u2212\u00a02Back-RP)]\u2009>\u2009[(Classification-SWi\u2009+\u2009Classification-SWr)/2\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Classification-RP]). \n\n\n### Region-wise analyses \n  \nRegions of interest (ROI) were defined as 3-mm radial spheres centered on the peak coordinates of the clusters, which were identified by the interaction contrast. For each participant, percent signal changes (PSCs) corresponding to each experimental condition were extracted from the ROI using the Marsbar toolbox ( ). The functional ROIs were labeled based on a parcellation into areas that have been functionally defined in other imaging studies by using Neurosynth  ( ). ROI analyses were performed to characterize brain activation patterns and to describe relationships between the neural activations and behavioral measurements of creativity task performance (i.e., the AUT scores) as well as attention-demanding task performance (i.e., the interference effect and switch cost). \n\nAccordingly, for the ROI identified by the RWR interaction contrast (namely, the significant interaction), PSCs were tested using pairwise comparisons between 2Back-SWi and 2Back-SWr, and between Classification-SWi and Classification-SWr, using paired samples t-tests, to identify the source of interaction. Similarly, the activation patterns of the ROI identified via the 2\u2009\u00d7\u20093 interaction were examined using pairwise comparisons of PSCs between 2Back-SW and 2Back-RP and between 2Back-SWi and 2Back-SWr, and then between Classification-SW and Classification-RP and between Classification-SWi and Classification-SWr. Subsequently, correlation analyses were conducted between the PSCs of these regions and the aforementioned behavioral measurements. Among the ROIs identified by the RWR contrast, the ROIs in which interaction was driven by the increased activity of 2Back-SWi relative to 2Back-SWr, rather than the other conditions, were selected. For these ROIs, the differences in PSCs between 2Back-SWi and 2Back-SWr were calculated, and these differences were correlated with the AUT scores, interference effect, and switch cost. In addition, for the ROI identified by the 2\u2009\u00d7\u20093 interaction, the neural 2Back switch cost (i.e., 2Back-SW\u20132Back-RP) and Classification switch cost (i.e., Classification-SW\u2013Classification-RP) were calculated and correlated with the behavioral measurements. The significance level of the correlation results was corrected at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (equivalent to uncorrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.0125) for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8927597, "text_md5": "e29d2b162bb385e592c72c5883639a0e", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 61], "journal": [62, 69], "publication_year": [71, 75], "title": [86, 166], "keywords": [180, 230], "abstract": [243, 1381], "body": [1390, 45452]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 35296732, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-08493-6", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8927597", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8927597"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8927597\">8927597</a>", "list_title": "PMC8927597  The role of the right prefrontal cortex in the retrieval of weak representations"}

Why? We combined behavioral computational modeling and multivariate decoding of fMRI responses to identify neural loci of regulation-related shifts in value representations across goals and domains (dietary or altruistic choice). Surprisingly, regulatory goals did not alter integrative value representations in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which represented all choice-relevant attributes across goals and domains. Instead, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) flexibly encoded goal-consistent values and predicted regulatory success for the majority of choice-relevant attributes, using attribute-specific neural codes. We also identified domain-specific exceptions: goal-dependent encoding of prosocial attributes localized to precuneus and temporo-parietal junction (not DLPFC). Our results suggest that cognitive regulation operated by changing specific attribute representations (not integrated values). Evidence of domain-general and domain-specific neural loci reveals important divisions of labor, explaining when and why regulatory success generalizes (or doesn\u2019t) across contexts and domains. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nChoices often require us to weigh competing considerations. Does a decadent piece of cake merit the pounds we\u2019ll put on afterwards? Should the pleas of a homeless person trump our own selfish needs? Empirical evidence suggests that the answer to these questions depends in part on a decision maker\u2019s goals ( ) and can be affected by intentional control ( ;  ;  ). Cognitive regulation of decision making thus serves an important function in goal-directed behavior ( ), relying on attention, working memory, and executive control to promote particular, goal-congruent choices (e.g., eat healthier, be kinder). Cognitive regulation of decision making is an important technique in therapeutic interventions for problematic behaviors, including obesity ( ), addiction ( ), and other decision making disorders ( ). Previous findings have significantly advanced our understanding of the psychological and neural bases of cognitive regulation of decision making ( ;  ;  ;  ), yet important questions about its computational underpinnings remain. At what level of the processing stream does goal-dependent cognitive regulation change the typical trajectory of choice? Does it operate in the same manner in different contexts, or does it depend on the domain? Answering these questions has important ramifications for understanding when people succeed or fail to implement their regulatory goals during decision making, why some people seem to succeed more often than others, and whether there are neural targets for treatment or biomarkers to identify at-risk individuals. \n\nIn studies of basic choice, weighted additive utility models have been used successfully to capture patterns in human behavior across a variety of domains ( ;  ). In these models, decision makers compute the decision value (DV) of each option as the weighted sum of its choice-relevant attributes   ( ;  ) and compare them to make a choice. Recent neuroscience work provides evidence in favor of this model, observing signals related to the value of specific attributes in distinct cortical and subcortical areas, for both social ( ;  ) and non-social choices ( ;  ). In turn, signals correlated with the overall, integrated decision value of an option have been observed in multiple regions, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and ventral striatum ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). A key goal of neuroeconomics is to describe how these attribute and decision value computations change as a function of regulatory goals and contexts, and to link such changes to regulatory success. Here, we sought to address three important questions about this process. \n\nFirst, at what level does cognitive regulation operate to change value representations? Based on the neuroeconomic model outlined above, we hypothesized two possibilities. The   attribute-level   hypothesis suggests that cognitive regulation of decision making could alter value representations at a relatively low level, by amplifying or diminishing attribute representations directly in a distributed set of specific, dedicated attribute-coding areas, similar to attentional effects on visual object encoding ( ). Alternatively, the   integration-level   hypothesis suggests that cognitive regulation of decision making might operate at comparatively higher levels in centralized, domain-general value integration areas such as the VMPFC ( ;  ). \n\nSecond, we aimed to explicitly test whether cognitive regulation alters value representations at the   same   level regardless of domain, or whether it differs as a function of attributes, goals or choice domain. For example, some attributes (such as taste) may be innate and prepotent, while other attributes (such as health or social considerations) may be more abstract or effortful to construct ( ;  ;  ). We sought to test whether these distinctions might affect where and how cognitive regulation operates to alter value representations during decision making. We also sought to determine whether this translates into distinct regulatory capacities as a function of regulatory goal or choice domain. \n\nFinally, we sought to shed light on whether information represented in VMPFC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) supports either attribute-level or integration-level changes in value during cognitive regulation of decision making. For example, some experimental evidence supports the idea that the DLPFC might represent more abstract attributes like health ( ;  ), and that regulatory control could modulate interactions between the DLPFC and VMPFC to change attribute weights in integrative decision value computations ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, several failures to observe changes in the VMPFC during cognitive regulation of decision making ( ;  ;  ) suggest the need to either measure value computation in a more sensitive way, or to identify alternate routes to behavioral change. \n\nAddressing these issues requires investigating regulatory control across multiple attributes and domains, using a sophisticated array of approaches for identifying changes in the representations of both specific attributes and integrated value signals. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain responses while subjects completed two choice tasks, separated in time by up to 24 months ( ). Choices involved foods varying in healthiness and tastiness (food task) or monetary proposals varying in payoffs for subjects and an anonymous partner (altruism task). To mimic the kinds of cognitive reframing approaches that are often used in therapy for decision making disorders ( ;  ), both tasks asked subjects to adopt distinct regulatory goals designed to highlight different choice attributes (e.g., \u2018focus on the food\u2019s healthiness\u2019, \u2018focus on your partner\u2019s feelings\u2019). To pinpoint whether and how regulation altered specific attribute representations or integrative value computations at the behavioral and neural level, we combined a multi-attribute extension of the drift diffusion model (DDM) ( ;  ) with multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) of neural responses ( ;  ). MVPA approaches to fMRI data exploit information encoded across multiple voxels and have been suggested to detect information that would be missed by conventional univariate analyses ( ). Past research on cognitive regulation has relied primarily on mass univariate approaches, which could account for some of the inconsistencies observed in the literature. Our study used MVPA to examine whether and how directed attention to specific goals affects the neural information content (i.e., decoding accuracies) for attribute values in different social and non-social decision contexts. We hypothesized that goal-dependent changes in neural decoding accuracies would match predictions on altered attribute weights from the behavioral computational model. We investigated where such changes occurred, whether they operate in generic or domain-specific manner, and whether they predicted specific aspects of regulatory success across individuals. \n   fMRI Paradigms and Choices.  \n(  A  ) Food Task. Subjects chose between on-screen food items that varied in tastiness and healthiness and a neutral default food. Choices were made in \u2018Natural\u2019 [NC], \u2018Focus on Health\u2019 [HC], and \u2018Focus on Taste\u2019 Conditions [TC]. (  B  ) Altruism Task. Subjects chose between on-screen proposals that affected the payoff of themselves ($Self) and an anonymous partner ($Other) and a default option ($20 for both). Choices were made in \u2018Natural\u2019 [NC], \u2018Focus on Ethics\u2019 [EC], and \u2018Focus on Partner\u2019 Conditions [PC]. (  C  ) (  D  ). Bar plots illustrate condition-wise percentages of healthy (C) and generous (D) choices (M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD), and subject-specific scores (circles). *p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, corrected,  p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, uncorrected. (  E  ) Computational behavioral model (DDM). Choices (yes/no) are made when the sequential accumulation of noisy value information that unfolds over time crosses the predefined upper or lower threshold for choice. The relative decision value (RDV) at a point in time (t) is computed as the weighted sum of choice relevant attributes plus noise (\u03b5) (i.e., RDV  = RDV +\u00a0w  * Tastiness\u00a0+\u00a0w  * Healthiness + \u03b5 ). In the example displayed here, the value of a candy bar will tend to accumulate in a positive direction if the weight on Tastiness is high (blue line), yielding a choice in favor of a tasty but unhealthy item. However, the value of the food item is more likely to accumulate in a negative direction if the weight on Healthiness is high (brown line). Note that saying Yes can sometimes indicate a healthy choice, and sometimes an unhealthy choice. (RT\u00a0=\u00a0reaction times [sec]; figure adapted from [ ;  ]). \n \n   Drift diffusion model (DDM) fits to behavior in both choice tasks.  \n(  A  ) Correspondence in the altruism task between observed acceptance rates (top) and response times (bottom) for different proposal types (bars) and model predictions (blue circles, determined using best-fitting parameters for each subject). On average, subject-level correlation between observed and predicted acceptance rates across trial types was generally quite high. (  B  ) Correspondence in the food task between observed and model-predicted acceptance rates (top) and response times (bottom) for foods of varying taste and healthiness (subject-specific ratings outside the scanner). For illustration purposes, for both tasks model fit to behavior is shown for eight bins created based on the displayed color scheme (right) for variations in choice-relevant attributes (increased attribute values from left to right). Thus, bar colors correspond to trials with specified combination of attributes. \n  \n \n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavior \n  \nTo identify how value computations change to accommodate regulatory goals, our analysis strategy proceeded in the several steps. First, on the behavioral level, we confirmed that regulatory goals resulted in altered choice behavior. We also used our computational behavioral models (multi-attribute drift diffusion models, DDMs) to link these alterations to amplification or suppression of the influence of specific choice-relevant attributes on choices. \n\n#### Choice behavior \n  \nChoices in both tasks varied considerably by regulatory goal ( ). In the food task, subjects made choices in three conditions: Respond Naturally [NC] (\u2018respond as you naturally would\u2019), Focus on Health [HC] (\u2018focus on the healthiness of the food when making the choice\u2019), and Focus on Taste [TC] (\u2018focus on the tastiness of the food when making the choice\u2019), implemented in interleaved blocks (see Appendix 1 \u2013 Instructions for regulatory conditions in both choice tasks for instructions). We defined a healthy choice as accepting the on-screen food if it was healthier than the default food (based on subject-specific healthiness ratings obtained outside of the scanner, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), and rejecting it otherwise. As expected, subjects made significantly healthier choices during HC (M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 78.83%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.46) compared to both NC (44.31%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.71) and TC (41.99%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.46; paired t-tests: p\u2019s\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Bonferroni corrected unless stated otherwise). They also made marginally less healthy choices during TC than NC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.043, uncorrected; repeated measures ANOVA across all conditions: F(2,35) = 97.01, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). \n\nIn the altruism task, subjects were instructed either to Respond Naturally [NC] (\u2018respond as you naturally would\u2019), Focus on Ethics [EC] (\u2018focus on doing the right thing and consider the ethical or moral implications of your choice\u2019), or Focus on Partner [PC] (\u2018focus on your partner\u2019s feelings and how the other person is affected by your choice\u2019) (see Appendix 1 \u2013 Instructions for regulatory conditions in both choice tasks for instructions). We defined an altruistic choice as accepting an on-screen proposal whose outcome (relative to the default) benefitted the other at a cost to the self, or rejecting one in which the subject stood to benefit but their partner did not. As expected, subjects made altruistic choices significantly less often under NC (28.71%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.48) compared to EC (49.94%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.22) or PC (66.97%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.35; p\u2019s\u00a0<\u00a00.001; F(2,35) = 65.96, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) ( ). Altruistic choices were also significantly higher in PC than EC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), suggesting that directing attention to another persons\u2019 feelings generally increased altruism more effectively than considering social and moral norms. Overall, these findings confirmed that regulatory goals resulted in altered choice behavior in the food task and the altruism task. \n\n\n#### Regulatory success \n  \nGiven the considerable individual heterogeneity in the extent of these changes, we also sought to understand whether this heterogeneity might be consistent across tasks and regulatory instructions. Regulatory success \u2013 defined as goal-consistent changes in percent healthy or altruistic choices ( ) (e.g., the increase in healthy choices during HC compared to NC) \u2013 covaried across tasks ( ). People who chose healthy foods more often when attending to a food\u2019s healthiness also behaved more altruistically when focusing on pro-social attributes. These results did not depend on the delay between tasks (partial correlations controlling for delay of up to 24 months, M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 16.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.66, range: 1 to 24) or differences in baseline responding   within   a particular condition: the percentage of healthy and altruistic choices during NC blocks of both tasks did not correlate (all p\u2019s\u00a0>\u00a00.05, uncorrected). Instead, they were driven by choice behavior during regulation: healthy choice during HC correlated with altruistic choice in both EC (r\u00a0=\u00a00.45, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and PC (r\u00a0=\u00a00.66, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Overall, these findings indicate that an individuals\u2019 regulatory success generalized across choice domains. We found no significant correlation of self-reported motivation to comply with instructions with regulation success in the food task (all p\u2019s\u00a0>\u00a00.14, uncorrected) or the altruism task (all p\u2019s\u00a0>\u00a00.16, uncorrected) (Appendix 1 \u2013 Self-reported motivation to comply with instructions and observed regulation-success). \n   Correlation of regulatory success (RS) in both choice tasks.      \n\n#### Computational parameter estimates (DDMs) \n  \nWe hypothesized that changes in choice behavior could result either from increased weighting of goal-consistent attributes (e.g. healthiness in HC), decreased weighting of goal-inconsistent attributes (e.g. tastiness in HC), or both. We tested these possibilities by fitting multi-attribute DDMs to behavior, separately for each subject in each condition and task (see Appendix 1 \u2013 Drift diffusion model for details). Model fits to behavior indicated that we were able to capture both choices and RTs with high accuracy ( ). Supplemental analyses also confirmed that the DDM did not perform worse in capturing behavior during regulation conditions compared to natural choices (Appendix 1 \u2013 Drift diffusion model). To determine if regulatory goals altered weights assigned to distinct attributes, we computed repeated measures ANOVAs with regulatory goal as a within-subject factor, separately for each attribute. \n\nAs predicted, regulatory goals in the food task changed the weights assigned to tastiness and healthiness (all F(2,35) \u2265 103.36, p\u2019s\u00a0<\u00a00.001; see   for attribute-specific estimates; for complete list of model-estimates and RTs see  ). Healthiness influenced food choices   more   in HC, and   less   in TC, compared to NC ( , all p\u2019s\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). By contrast, tastiness influenced food choices less in HC, compared to both NC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and TC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) ( ). No differences emerged between NC and TC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.47, uncorrected, 2-tailed), suggesting that decision processes in TC likely resemble natural choice contexts. \n   Goal-dependent modulation of attribute value encoding.  \n Behavioral   weights (left column)\u00a0assigned to attributes in food choices (  A  . Healthiness,   C  . Tastiness) or altruistic choices (  E  . $Self,   G  . $Other,   I  . Fairness) varied by regulatory goal (estimates of drift diffusion models, DDMs).   Neural   decoding accuracies of attribute values (right\u00a0column)\u00a0also varied across conditions in specific brain regions (  B  . Healthiness,   D  . Tastiness,   F  . $Self,   H  . $Other,   J  . Fairness) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE corrected at cluster-level) (estimates of Support Vector Regression models, SVRs).

Subjects\u2019 choices were swayed more strongly by their own monetary outcome ($Self) in NC compared to PC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and marginally compared to EC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.059, uncorrected, 2-tailed) ( ). Moreover, the influence of their own payoffs on choices decreased more dramatically in PC than EC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In contrast, estimated weights on the partner\u2019s monetary outcome ($Other) increased for both pro-social regulatory conditions compared to NC (p\u2019s\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with marginally higher weights in PC than EC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013, uncorrected, 2-tailed) ( ). Fairness of proposed payouts (\u22121*|$Self - $Other|) influenced choices significantly less in NC compared to EC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and marginally less compared to PC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.021, uncorrected, 2-tailed). Weight on fairness was also significantly higher in EC than PC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) ( ). Note that within-task results for the altruism task are reported for the slightly larger sample size of 49 subjects. Considering only the subset of subjects that also participated in the food task (N\u00a0=\u00a036) yielded comparable weights for attributes in altruistic choices ( ). Overall, the results suggest that regulatory goals changed choice behavior by both increasing weighting of goal-consistent attributes (e.g. healthiness in HC) and decreasing weighting of goal-inconsistent attributes (e.g. tastiness in HC). \n\n\n\n### Neural encoding of choice attributes and effects of regulation \n  \nNext, we examined neural underpinnings of goal-consistent increases/decreases in the influence of attributes on altered choices in both tasks. This analysis step was designed to provide evidence for the effects of regulation at the attribute-level or integration-level. Both hypotheses suggest that changes in the influence of distinct attributes on choice should correspond to changes in neural encoding of those attributes. However, they make different predictions about   where   these changes should be observed. The attribute-level hypothesis predicts that attributes are encoded in attribute-specific brain areas and that regulation should result in changes to these local representations. By contrast, the integration-level hypothesis suggests that attribute-specific areas should encode attributes similarly   regardless   of the regulatory goal. Instead, altered representations should appear only within centralized brain regions associated with value-integration, such as the VMPFC, and should be detectable in a common signal associated with integrated values. We tested these distinct predictions by examining where attribute values were represented in the brain, and how these representations varied as a function of regulatory focus. We also explicitly tested whether the locus of effect differed across attributes (e.g. tastiness/healthiness, $Self/$Other/Fairness) or choice domain (e.g. social, non-social). \n\n#### Neural encoding of choice attributes and decision values\u00a0across\u00a0conditions \n  \nOur behavioral results suggest that a weighted combination of different choice-relevant attributes captures behavior in both choice tasks ( ), implying that attribute information should be represented in the brain. However, the generality and specificity of this encoding has important implications both for theories about how different attributes are constructed, and how regulation operates to modulate their influence. We first sought to determine which brain regions reliably encoded trial-by-trial variation in a given attribute across experimental conditions and goals. Thus, this first set of decoding analyses tested   if   neural activation patterns encode attribute values, irrespective of whether one or several conditions drive this predictive information. To this end, we averaged the condition-specific decoding maps of an attribute for each subject and tested for brain regions that reliably predict values of the attribute at the group level. Consistent with predictions, information about each attribute could be decoded significantly above chance in multiple brain regions ( ), including the VMPFC, and, for some attributes, the DLPFC. This was also true for trial-by trial encoding of decision values (DVs, corresponding to observable choices in the altruism and food task). See   (main effects) for a complete list of results and details on the clusters in the (V)MPFC and DLPFC for the neural decoding of DVs. \n   Neural prediction of trial-wise attribute values in food choices and altruistic choices.      \n\n#### Conjunction of neural representations of choice attributes \n  \nGiven the robust coding of individual attributes, we asked whether any brain regions encoded   all   attribute values across all contexts, as might be expected of domain-general areas contributing to value integration processes. A formal conjunction of all attribute-specific decoding maps (Healthiness, Tastiness, $Self, $Other, Fairness; thresholded at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE cluster-level correction, height threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) identified VMPFC ([MNI \u22126, 49, 1],  ) as well as a handful of other regions ( ). This suggests that the VMPFC contains information on trial-wise values of   all   choice-relevant attributes, consistent with its hypothesized importance for valuation and choice. \n   Conjunction of neural representations of attribute values.  \nMultivariate response patterns in the VMPFC encoded trial-wise values of all choice-relevant food attributes (Tastiness, Healthiness) and altruistic attributes ($Self, $Other, Fairness) across regulation conditions, as indicated by a conjunction of attribute-specific decoding maps thresholded at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE corrected at cluster-level. \n \n   Conjunction of brain areas that encoded trial-by-trial values of all attributes.  \nAttribute values for Healthiness, Tastiness, $Self, $Other, Fairness. Each attribute was thresholded at p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, cluster-level corrected, k\u00a0=\u00a010 voxels. Not displayed are clusters in the supplemental motor area ([MNI \u22123 26, 46], 43 voxels) and visual cortex ([MNI \u221228,\u201385, 32], 15 voxels, [MNI \u221221,\u201367, 40], 10 voxels). Coordinates refer to center of mass for the identified clusters in MNI space (Montreal Neurological Institute), R\u00a0=\u00a0right hemisphere. \n  \n\n   Exploratory functional connectivity analyses.  \n(  A  ) Region of the VMPFC (red) where increased connectivity with the DLPFC during Health vs. Natural and Taste focus conditions correlates with \u0394w Healthiness in Health vs. Natural and Taste Focus.

All results are shown thresholded at p\u00a0<\u00a00.005 uncorrected. \n  \n \n\n#### Goal-dependent representations of choice attributes and decision values \n  \nHaving confirmed that attribute values (and decision values) could be decoded from neural response patterns, we next asked whether, how and where neural information content changed as a function of regulatory goals. We hypothesized that altered behavioral weights of an attribute should be mirrored by changes in the neural encoding of that attribute as expressed in varying predictive accuracies. Crucially, these analyses allowed us to test whether goal-dependent change in neural encoding of attribute values occurs in attribute-specific regions or at a common neural locus regardless of attribute or domain. For each attribute, we used a repeated measures ANOVA implemented in SPM together with condition-specific decoding accuracy maps to test for changes in neural information on attribute values across conditions (see  ). This allowed us to identify brain regions where neural information content about an attribute, or decision values ( ), was enhanced or diminished in a way that matched behaviorally-estimated changes in attribute weighting (thresholded at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, cluster-level corrected, height threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; see  ). \n   Goal-dependent coding of attribute values (left to right).  \nFor each participant, we created a spherical searchlight (left panel, black sphere) and extracted multi-voxel response patterns for every trial of a choice task (middle panel). Next, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) regression model with data of 8 runs (80 trials), using neural response patterns as features and trial-wise attribute values as labels (e.g. a food\u2019s perceived tastiness). Test data consisted of data of the ninth run (10 trials) for which we predicted the trial-wise attribute values solely based on neural response patterns of these trials. The decoding accuracy (average of 9-fold cross-validation) was assigned to the central voxel of the sphere from which we extracted the neural data (right upper panel). This procedure was repeated for every measured voxel (left panel, dotted red line), yielding a whole brain accuracy map for an attribute, separately for each task condition and participant. Finally, at the group level (lower right panel), we used these whole-brain accuracy maps to test for brain regions where predictive information on an attribute was increased/decreased depending on the task condition, based on predictions of the behavioral computational model (DDM). (Note that condition-specific accuracy maps also allowed testing for main effects of neural encoding of an attribute (i.e. encodes attribute values), irrespective of whether one or several conditions drive the effect.). \n     Goal-dependent change of neural information content on attribute values.      \n##### Healthiness \n  \nBehavioral model-fitting suggests that healthiness was weighted more heavily in HC compared to both NC and TC ( ). Consistent with model-based predictions, decoding accuracies in the right lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) were higher when focusing on health [HC] compared to both other task conditions ([HC\u00a0>NC], and [HC\u00a0>TC]) and combined [HC > (NC, TC)];  ;  ). \n\n\n##### Tastiness \n  \nBehaviorally, tastiness was represented less strongly in HC compared to NC and TC, with no significant differences between the latter ( ). Decoding accuracies in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), extending to the mid frontal gyrus (MFG), closely matched these predictions [(NC, TC)\u00a0>\u00a0HC] ( ). Neural representations of trial-wise tastiness were also significantly higher for separate comparisons of [NC\u00a0>\u00a0HC] and [TC\u00a0>\u00a0HC], but did not differ between NC and TC. Only two other regions (visual cortex and left motor cortex) followed this pattern ( ). \n\n\n##### $Self \n  \nEstimates of the best-fitting behavioral parameters for $Self suggest that neural information representing subjects\u2019 own benefits should decrease in both pro-social regulation conditions (PC and EC) compared to NC ( ). Formal tests of this pattern ([NC > (EC, PC)]) identified neural responses in both DMPFC ( ) and the MFG (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, uncorrected;  ; for [NC] > [EC] significant at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, cluster-corrected). \n\n\n##### $Other \n  \nBased on the behavioral model we predicted that, compared to NC, the partner\u2019s benefits should be represented more strongly when attending to either ethical implications or the other\u2019s thoughts and feelings ( ). Surprisingly, no brain regions matched this precise pattern (for [(PC, EC)\u00a0>\u00a0NC], or [PC\u00a0>\u00a0NC], or [EC\u00a0>\u00a0NC], at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, cluster-corrected). However, a comparison of [PC\u00a0>\u00a0EC] revealed that decoding accuracies in the bilateral precuneus and right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) ( ) ( ) were significantly more predictive of the others\u2019 payoffs when goals focused on the partner compared to ethical implications. Supplemental ROI analyses within these two areas indicated that average predictive accuracies were significantly higher in PC than NC, partially confirming the prediction of amplified information for $Other [PC\u00a0>\u00a0NC] from the behavioral model ( ). \n\n\n##### Fairness \n  \nBehaviorally, fairness of payoffs for self and partner influenced choices more strongly when attending to ethics [EC] and, to a lesser extent, the partner\u2019s feelings [PC] ( ). Consistent with model-based predictions, decoding accuracies in the left superior frontal sulcus (SFS) predicted the degree of fairness more strongly in the two regulatory conditions compared to natural choice contexts ( ). Contrary to the model prediction, comparisons of [EC\u00a0>\u00a0PC] (and [PC\u00a0>\u00a0EC]) did not yield any significant results, suggesting that both regulation conditions increased neural representations of fairness considerations to a comparable level. \n\nNotably, repeated measures ANOVAs also allowed testing for changes in neural attribute representations or decision values that were   not   predicted by changes in the behavioral DDM estimates. These supplemental tests did not yield any further significant results (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE cluster-corrected). \n\n\n##### Decision values \n  \nSee   for details on goal-dependent coding of decision values in both tasks. Only two regions (motor cortex in food task [TC\u00a0>\u00a0HC], cerebellum in altruism task [EC\u00a0>PC]) were found to be significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE cluster-corrected). We thus focused on goal-dependent changes in information content on attribute values. \n\n\n\n#### A common hub for cognitive regulation of attribute values in the DLPFC \n  \nTo determine whether any areas might serve as a common pathway for goal-dependent changes in encoding of choice attributes, we computed 2-, 3- and 4-way conjunctions of all clusters that showed modulations of predictive information across conditions ( ). A cluster in the MFG ( ), hereafter referred to as DLPFC, emerged in the 3-way conjunction of voxels that flexibly encoded attribute values for Healthiness, Tastiness, and $Self. We found no other areas showing such a convergence of attributes. \n   Domain-general locus of goal-dependent attribute coding.  \n(  A  ) Conjunction of voxels in DLPFC that flexibly encoded attribute values of Healthiness, Tastiness, and $Self across conditions within the respective task (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE corrected at cluster-level). (  B  ) Cross-condition decoding analyses tested for shared neural code in the DLPFC conjunction area across attributes and regulatory goals. Multivariate SVR models were trained on data in one condition (e.g. Taste NC) and tested on another (e.g. Taste TC), and vice versa (2-fold cross-validation; within-cell sanity checks used split-half approach). Red illustrates significant cross-condition decoding, blue illustrates non-significant results (permutation tests, cutoff-values of 95th percentile of empirical null-distribution).   Within-attribute decoding   (yellow frames): similar neural codes in DLPFC encode values of an attribute across contexts/regulatory conditions (with the exception of 2 of 18 tests).   Cross-attribute decoding  : neural response patterns that encode values of one attribute don\u2019t allow predicting values of another attribute (neither within-task [tastiness-healthiness] nor across tasks [tastiness-$Self, healthiness-$Self]), independent of contexts. This pattern of results indicates that goal-sensitive representations of attribute values in DLPFC rely on attribute-specific neural codes. \n  \nThis finding suggests that the DLPFC acts as a domain-general circuit for goal-sensitive value representations. But what does this convergence in the DLPFC signify? On the one hand, the DLPFC might encode a   unitary decision value signal   that is sensitive to current goals. While limited to a specific set of attributes, this would support the integration-level hypothesis. If this was the case, the same code that represents a food\u2019s tastiness in the food task (e.g. when focusing on taste) should also permit decoding of other attribute values used in other contexts (i.e., healthiness when focused on health, $Self in natural settings of altruistic choice). On the other hand, the DLPFC might compute attribute-specific representations in a goal-sensitive manner. This hypothesis is more consistent with attribute-level modulation. In this case, encoding of attribute values in this region should be unique to each specific attribute (i.e. codes for one attribute should not permit decoding of other attributes). We tested these competing predictions in a post-hoc ROI-based analysis examining the extent to which neural codes for one attribute in one context (e.g. tastiness in TC) generalize across attributes and contexts (e.g. healthiness in HC). These post-hoc decoding analyses differ from the previous set of analyses: more specifically, to probe for shared neural code in the DLPFC, we trained the SVM regression model on data of one attribute in one condition and see if it allows predicting trial-wise values of   another   attribute in the same or different regulatory condition (and vice versa, 2-fold cross-validation). We also tested for common neural codes for the same attribute across regulatory contexts. \n\nResults most clearly supported the attribute-level hypothesis. While codes for each attribute (tastiness, healthiness, and $Self) in the DLPFC generally allowed for decoding of the same attribute in other conditions at significant or marginally significant levels, no attribute allowed for coding of a   different   attribute, regardless of condition ( ). This supports the idea that the DLPFC acts as a domain-general mechanism for representing different attributes in a goal-sensitive manner, using unique codes for each attribute. \n\n\n#### No evidence for goal-dependent coding of attribute values and decision values in the VMPFC \n  \nThe vmPFC has previously been suggested to encode attribute values as a function of their current relevance to choice control ( ). Notably, our analyses on the whole brain level did not reveal any significant variation of attribute value encoding in this area as a function of the regulatory goal. However, in light of previous evidence, we conducted a number of post-hoc ROI-analyses to probe in a more sensitive manner for goal-dependent value coding in the VMPFC (see Appendix 1 \u2013 ROI-based post-hoc tests to identify goal-consistent value coding in the VMPFC). While activation patterns in the VMPFC (as well as several other regions) reliably predicted overall decision values in both tasks, regulation failed to modulate decoding accuracies for decision value ( ) or for   any   specific attribute (Appendix 1 \u2013 ROI-based post-hoc tests to identify goal-consistent value coding in the VMPFC), and did not predict individual differences in regulatory success (Appendix 1 \u2013 ROI-based post-hoc tests to identify goal-consistent value coding in the VMPFC). \n\n\n\n### Individual differences in regulatory success \n  \nAre some people   generally   more successful using cognitive regulation of decision making or does it depend on the choice domain? Why? To address these questions, we examined the generality and specificity of value representations and their role in regulatory success. In particular, we predicted that if regulatory success operates through common   domain-general   mechanisms, individual success in regulating the effects of one attribute should be correlated with regulatory success in modifying different attributes in completely different contexts. Consequently, neural responses within such a domain-general neural locus should predict individual differences in people\u2019s regulatory success across domains. By contrast, to the extent that cognitive regulation of decision making operates at the attribute-level in a   domain-specific   manner, success regulating one attribute in one domain should be uncorrelated with regulatory success for other attributes in other domains. It should also be predicted by neural activation in distinct, non-overlapping brain regions. \n\n#### Regulatory success in goal-dependent attribute weighting \n  \nAlthough our previous analyses suggested that regulatory success as measured by frequency of healthy and generous choices was correlated across participants, this analysis did not examine how such success relates to changes in specific attributes. Thus, to determine whether regulatory success operates through common channels across attributes and domains, we first tested using behavior whether subjects\u2019 ability to modulate specific attribute weights (estimated in separate DDMs) was correlated across the two tasks. Consistent with the notion of a common neural mechanism (in DLPFC), successful reduction in the weight on selfish considerations (\u0394w $Self) in altruistic choices was correlated with successfully amplifying the weight on health considerations in food choices (e.g., r\u00a0=\u00a00.50, for \u0394w $Self [NC - PC] and \u0394w Healthiness [HC - NC], p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, corrected) and suppressing the weight of taste considerations in food choices (e.g., r\u00a0=\u00a00.45, \u0394w $Self [NC - PC] and \u0394w Tastiness [NC - TC], p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, corrected). Notably, however, enhancement of the weight on another person\u2019s outcomes did   not   correlate with changes in other attributes (all p\u2019s\u00a0>\u00a00.05, uncorrected). See   for detailed list of results. Overall, this pattern suggests that regulation may operate through both common and distinct channels as a function of specific attributes, a point we return to in the neural results below. \n\n\n#### Domain-general predictions of individual differences in regulatory success in DLPFC \n  \nOur preceding neural decoding results support a model in which regulation alters specific attribute representations within domain-general brain areas for some attributes (e.g., tastiness, healthiness, $Self) and within domain-specific areas for other attributes (e.g., $Other, fairness). This idea may explain the specific pattern of correlations we observed in behavioral measures of regulatory success and makes a further prediction: if the integrity and flexibility of the DLPFC is only necessary for representing certain attributes in a goal-consistent manner, then responses in this region should predict regulatory success only for those attributes that converge in this area, while regulatory success for other attributes (e.g., $Other) should be predicted by other regions (e.g., TPJ or precuneus). We tested this hypothesis using a cross-subject decoding approach: in a nutshell, this decoding analysis tested whether multi-voxel activation patterns in an ROI (e.g. DLPFC) allowed predicting an individuals regulatory success in a choice task, solely based on the participants regulation-related neural activation patterns (see Materials and methods and Appendix 1 \u2013 Multivariate regression of individual differences in regulatory success for details). The analyses focused on an ROI in DLPFC (with supplemental tests for TPJ, precuneus, and VMPFC) and regulatory success scores defined both by changes in attribute weights and by percentage of goal-consistent choices. \n\nAs hypothesized, regulation-related neural activation patterns in the right DLPFC conjunction area ( ) during the food task reliably predicted how well a subject decreased taste weights and increased health weights in food choices (\u0394w Tastiness [(NC, TC) - HC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.51, p\u00a0<\u00a00.014, permutation test; \u0394w Healthiness [HC - (NC, TC)]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.42, p\u00a0<\u00a00.041). Predictions further improved when we focused on altered attribute weights for HC versus TC (\u0394w Tastiness [TC - HC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.68, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002; \u0394w Healthiness [HC - TC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.47, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014). Similar results were found when we predicted subject-specific changes in regulation success based on improved dietary choices (\u0394Healthy Choices [HC - (NC, TC)]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.50, p\u00a0=\u00a00.016; \u0394Healthy Choices [HC - TC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.46, p\u00a0=\u00a00.027), demonstrating that regulation-related neural predictions extend to actual behavior with real consequences. \n\nNext, we asked whether neural activation patterns in the right DLPFC also predict individual differences in regulation success in the altruism task. Remarkably, neural patterns in DLPFC during   food   choices predicted subjects\u2019 ability to reduce the weighting of their own monetary payoffs during   altruistic   choices separated in time by an average of 16 months from the food task (\u0394w $Self [NC - (EC, PC)]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.50, p\u00a0=\u00a00.015; \u0394w Self [NC - PC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.55, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005; permutation tests). They also predicted increases in generous behavior when attending to pro-social attributes (\u0394Generous Choices [(PC, EC) - NC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.63, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; \u0394Generous Choices [EC - NC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.44, p\u00a0=\u00a00.028; \u0394Generous Choices [PC - NC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.63, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Supplemental analyses suggest that predictive information on altered generosity was driven by neural information on changes in the attribute encoded in the DLPFC ($Self) and not by other attributes of the altruistic choice task (e.g., $Other, fairness) (see Appendix 1 \u2013 DLPFC-based prediction of goal-consistent changes of generosity is driven by goal-consistent changes in attribute representations of $Self (but not $Other or Fairness)). We also confirmed that decoding accuracies were not correlated with the delay between both choice tasks (all p\u2019s\u00a0>\u00a00.05, uncorrected), indicating that predictions of individual difference scores of regulatory success were unrelated to temporal delays between tasks. Complementary decoding analyses based on brain data obtained during altruistic choices revealed similar patterns, further supporting our findings ( ). \n\n\n#### Precuneus encodes individual differences in regulatory success in altruistic choice \n  \nStrikingly, patterns in the DLPFC did not decode regulatory success for social attributes that were flexibly encoded in other regions of the brain (i.e., $Other, Fairness). A post-hoc analyses tested whether neural activation patterns that encoded values of $Other in a goal-consistent manner would allow predicting individual differences in regulatory success in the altruism task. We found that response patterns in the precuneus reliably predicted individuals\u2019 altered generosity in the altruism task (\u0394Generous Choices [PC - EC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.57, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002 [CI: \u22120.41, 0.38]; \u0394Generous Choices [(NC, PC) - EC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.61, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004 [CI: \u22120.41, 0.41]), suggesting that domain-specific attribute coding contributes to individual differences in regulatory control. \n\n\n#### VMPFC does not encode individual differences in regulatory success \n  \nBecause of its hypothesized role in valuation, a post-hoc analyses also examined whether the VMPFC region that encoded all attributes predicted regulatory success in either choice task. However, local activation patterns in VMPFC were   not   predictive of regulatory success for any attribute (all p\u2019s\u00a0>\u00a00.31). This result suggests that while this region may encode all choice-relevant attributes, it was not the locus for changes in value representation in this task. However, exploratory functional connectivity analyses provided subtle hints that the VMPFC could be indirectly related to regulatory success through its modulation of both DLPFC and precuneus (see   and Appendix 1 \u2013 Changes in functional connectivity with the VMPFC correlate with regulatory success for details). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nCognitive regulation of decision making represents a crucial tool for altering behavior to fit momentary goals (e.g. eat healthy, be kinder). Capitalizing on the strengths of behavioral model-fitting ( ) and the greater sensitivity of neural multivariate pattern analysis ( ), we demonstrate how regulatory goals modulate value representations at the level of choice-relevant attributes, supporting goal-consistent behavior. Unexpectedly, cognitive regulation of decision making did   not   reliably modulate value signals within the VMPFC. Instead, regulatory effects converged to modulate a subset of distinct attribute representations in both the social and non-social domain within a region of the DLPFC that has previously been implicated in value-based choice ( ;  ;  ). Cognitive regulation of decision making also altered attribute representations for specific   social   attributes in distinct areas, including TPJ and precuneus. This pattern of neural convergence and divergence was reflected by behavioral patterns of covariation in regulatory success across tasks, made more remarkable by the fact that they were measured anywhere from weeks to more than a year apart. Our results provide important and novel insights into the domain generality and specificity of cognitive regulation of decision making, explain when and why regulatory success generalizes across contexts and domains, and raise exciting new questions for exploration. \n\n### Attribute-level vs. integration-level effects of cognitive regulation of decision making \n  \nDo goals (e.g. eat healthier, be kinder) influence construction of value by operating on distinct attribute representations, or by changing integration of these values in centralized, common-value regions of the brain? Our results provide three key pieces of evidence in favor of attribute-level value modulation by cognitive regulatory control. First, although the VMPFC contained reliable information on the values of   all   attributes and encoded overall decision values across social and non-social contexts, these signals showed   no   modulation by regulatory goal for any attribute or decision value and did not predict individual differences in regulatory success. Moreover, no other area showed a complete correspondence between behavioral and neural effects of regulation, arguing against a single, centralized locus for effects of cognitive regulation on decision making. Second, we observed goal-dependent representations of some attributes (i.e., others\u2019 benefits) in distinct, specialized brain regions like the TPJ and precuneus. Third, although we observed converging effects of regulation for a subset of attributes in the DLPFC (including tastiness, healthiness, and self-related benefits), representations of these attributes utilized distinct, differentiated codes. Taken together, although our results do not preclude the possibility that in other contexts cognitive regulation of decision making might operate on a single, centralized value integration mechanism, they suggest that it may often operate by changing distinct attribute representations. \n\n\n### Domain-general vs. domain-specific effects of cognitive regulation \n  \nIf cognitive regulation of decision making is mediated by changes in distinct attribute representations, when might we expect regulatory success \u2013 or failure \u2013 to generalize across contexts and domains? Our results indicate that although the DLPFC used distinct codes to represent different attributes, it may nevertheless be a common denominator in regulatory success across domains. Behaviorally, goal-consistent shifts toward \u2018virtuous\u2019 behavior in one domain (i.e. healthier food choice) correlated with shifts in the other (i.e. more generosity). This covariation was driven by correlated changes in the behavioral weighting of   precisely   those attributes represented in the DLPFC (i.e., tastiness, healthiness, and self-related benefits), but not in attributes encoded elsewhere (i.e. other-related benefits, fairness). These findings are even more remarkable given delays of up to 24 months separating the two choice tasks (average 16 months), ruling out alternative explanations like memory, mood, or priming effects. Thus, the DLPFC may represent a stable individual resource permitting flexible representation of specific attributes according to current goals. \n\nAt the same time, goal-consistent changes in pro-social attributes (e.g. others benefits) appeared in areas like the TPJ and precuneus, especially when focused on the partner\u2019s thoughts and feelings. This accords with growing evidence linking these regions to   domain-specific   computations related to Theory of Mind (ToM) ( ;  ;  ) and representing others\u2019 mental states and needs during social choice: for instance, activation patterns in the rTPJ were recently shown to encode individual differences in the level of ToM during altruistic choice ( ). Notably, activity in these regions did not encode other social attributes (e.g., fairness) or their goal-consistent changes. Moreover, focusing on ethical and normative reasons for giving (which may require less focus on others\u2019 specific thoughts and feelings) increased altruistic choice, but actually   decreased   representations of the other\u2019s payoffs in these regions. Thus, the TPJ and precuneus appear to encode features specifically related to representing others\u2019 outcomes in a goal-sensitive manner, pointing to specialized loci of cognitive regulation in social choice domains. \n\n\n### The role of VMPFC and DLPFC in valuation and cognitive regulation \n  \nOur study adds to a growing body of experimental work finding that behavioral effects of regulation can occur in the absence of corresponding changes to either overall levels of VMPFC response ( ;  ;  ), or VMPFC representation of specific attributes like taste ( ). They also raise the intriguing possibility that the flexibility of DLPFC attribute representations may be particularly important for compensating when regulation of the VMPFC fails, a finding also observed in other studies of cognitive regulation of decision making ( ). This raises an important question: what determines the capacity of the DLPFC to properly represent these different attributes? Intriguingly, exploratory connectivity results suggested that this may actually derive, at least in part, from functional interactions with the VMPFC area that represented all choice-relevant attributes, with the strength of connectivity between DLPFC and VMPFC correlating with regulatory success. Although speculative, this finding is consistent with research in both animals and humans suggesting that the VMPFC may modulate affective attribute representations in other areas ( ;  ). These results could also suggest that VMPFC represents an earlier stage in the value construction process, with DLPFC representations emerging more closely to response. Future work including the use of measures with higher temporal precision may help to elucidate when and how interactions between the VMPFC and DLPFC determine regulatory success in different contexts. \n\n\n### Explaining individual differences in regulatory success and failure \n  \nOur study is the first to document goal-consistent changes for   all   choice-relevant attributes, across diverse choice domains, both within and across individuals, shedding light on when and why regulatory efforts may succeed or fail. Our findings point to important divisions in regulatory success as a function of choice attributes and domain: an individual who struggles both to resist cheesecake and ignore their own self-interest may nevertheless have little difficulty in harnessing regulation to represent others\u2019 needs and use this as input into social choices. This has important implications in treatment for decision making disorders: if therapeutic interventions fail when focused on one attribute (e.g., be less selfish), a switch to strategies focused on other attributes (e.g., think more about others) might be more effective. Future work will need to explore the full range of domains and attributes in which regulation could play an important role (e.g., risk, intertemporal choice, etc.) in order to determine the extent to which regulatory effects vary or converge across attributes and domains. \n\nIt is also worth noting that goal-consistent changes in attribute representations were generally exceptions rather than the rule.   Most   regions permitting attribute decoding showed   no   discernable change in representation of attributes as a function of goal. This may explain why regulatory success often feels so difficult: unregulated attribute representations in some areas (including the VMPFC) may continue to leak into choices, complicating regulatory success. It also argues against a trivial interpretation of our results that the changes we observed are simply uninteresting reflections of behavior: we observed highly specific and localized success-related changes in regions like DLPFC, TPJ, and precuneus, but not in other areas. This suggests that these regions may perform a special role in mediating the impact of regulatory goals on behavior. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nWe cannot completely rule out that regulatory affects on behavior and attribute representations might partly reflect differences in motivation to satisfy expectations of the experimenter. However, we note that the specific patterns of convergence and divergence in regulatory success argue against this interpretation of our results: we suspect that if this were the case, we would not have observed either the distinct profile of within-subject correlations in regulatory success for different attributes, or differences in their neural correlates. Nevertheless, further research will be needed to fully resolve the extent to which individual differences in regulatory success result from limits in motivation or limits on capacity. Work examining whether gray matter volume in either the DLPFC and VMPFC predicts regulatory success across individuals might help to resolve such issues ( ). Tying laboratory measures of regulation to real-world consequences also remains a necessary future step in understanding the significance of these findings. \n\nOur results also point to a number of other open questions and future directions. The implementation of a strictly data driven approach confirmed that several   a priori   hypothesized regions of interest such as the VMPFC or the DLPFC are crucial for implementing cognitive control of goal-directed choice. However, we cannot rule out that other brain regions not identified by the current analyses (e.g. the ventral striatum) also contribute to decision making during regulation. Indeed, we observed changes in attribute decoding in restricted, non-overlapping areas of visual and motor cortex for some but not all attributes, which might reflect non-causal changes in visual attention or motor preparation, but could also be important precursors to downstream changes in areas like the DLPFC, TPJ and precuneus. \n\nThe close correspondence between neural patterns and model-estimated changes in behavioral weighting suggests that our information-based neural measure captured a critical aspect of changes in neural computations during goal-dependent behavior. However, further investigation is necessary to understand what separates attributes whose representations converged in DLPFC from those that did not. One exciting avenue for future research will be to identify the precise factors that determine whether and when the DLPFC acts as the site for cognitive regulation of value. Understanding this distinction may help to predict when an individual will show more global deficits in regulatory success and when those deficits will tend to stand apart from success or failure in other domains or contexts. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nFifty-five healthy volunteers (25 female, M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 28 years\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.02) participated in the altruism task. A subset (N\u00a0=\u00a037, 17 female, 29 years\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.24) also completed the food task. Sample size for both established fMRI tasks were selected based on previous successful implementations of the food task ( ) and the altruism task ( ). All subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were free of psychiatric or neurological history. Subjects received $20/hour for their participation, plus the money from a trial selected randomly at the end of the altruism task. They also received a randomly selected food item at the end of the food experiment that had to be consumed in the lab. The altruism data of five subjects and the food data of one subject were excluded from further analyses due to excessive movement (>3 mm/3degree). The altruism data of another subject was excluded from the analysis due to invariant choice behavior. All subjects gave written informed consent and Caltech\u2019s Internal Review Board approved the study. \n\n\n### Tasks \n  \nSubjects performed two separate fMRI tasks as part of a large-scale cross-sectional research project. Task order was fixed, with the food task completed on average 16 months (SD:\u00a0\u00b18.66; range: 1\u201324) after the altruism task to specifically probe for common and distinct computations in non-social and social goal-dependent choices. \n\n#### Food task \n  \n\u00a0The non-social fMRI task was a modified version of an established food task ( ). On every trial, subjects chose between one of 90 food items presented on-screen (4 s) and a default food chosen prior to scanning ( ). Subjects responded by pressing one of four buttons corresponding to \u2018strong yes\u2019, \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018no\u2019, \u2018strong no\u2019 (displayed at the bottom of the screen), using a button box placed in their right hand. The assignment of choice preferences to buttons was fixed throughout the task and the right-left orientation of the scale was counterbalanced across subjects. Inter-trial intervals varied from 1 to 4 s (average of 2 s), during which a white fixation cross was presented against a black background. After scanning, one trial was randomly drawn to determine what the subject would eat before leaving the lab. If subjects failed to respond within the 4 s of the selected trial either the on-screen or the default option was randomly chosen. \n\nSubjects made food choices under three conditions:   Respond Naturally   (\u2018respond as you naturally would\u2019, [NC]),   Focus on Health   (\u2018focus on the healthiness of the food when making the choice\u2019, [HC]), or   Focus on Taste   (\u2018focus on the tastiness of the food when making the choice\u2019, [TC]) (see Appendix 1 \u2013 Instructions for regulatory conditions in both choice tasks for instructions). Importantly, subjects were explicitly instructed to always make the decision based on their preference, regardless of the condition. Every condition comprised nine blocks (with 10 trials per block), resulting in a total of 90 trials per condition. Prior to every block, detailed instructions appeared for 4 s. In addition, during food display, a short description (\u2018Respond Naturally\u2019, \u2018Focus on Health\u2019, \u2018Focus on Taste\u2019) appeared at the top of the screen to remind participants of the current instruction. Each of the nine functional scanning runs contained one block of every condition (i.e., three task blocks per run), with the order of conditions randomized across runs and subjects. The only exception was the first task block, which was pre-assigned to \u2018natural\u2019 for every subject. Practice trials as well as a short quiz prior to scanning ensured that subjects understood the instructions for each condition and were comfortable with the timing of the task. \n\nFood items varied in their perceived tastiness and healthiness and included healthy snacks (e.g., apples, broccoli) and junk foods (e.g., candy bars, chips). Items were selected based on subjects ratings in a self-paced computerized task prior to scanning that assessed perceived tastiness (5-point Likert scale, \u2018very untasty\u2019 to\u00a0\u2018very tasty\u2019) and healthiness (5-point Likert scale, \u2018very unhealthy\u2019 to \u2018very healthy\u2019) of 200 food items ( ;  ). Ninety food items were selected from this larger set to cover the range of health and taste ratings in a roughly uniform manner. In addition, for each subject we chose one default food that was perceived as neutral for taste and health. Each food item was presented once in each of three choice conditions, with presentation order randomized across blocks, functional runs, and subjects. To ensure the motivational saliency of the food items, subjects were asked to refrain from eating 4 hr prior to testing. Stimulus presentation was implemented using high-resolution color pictures (72 dpi) and Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 ( ) together with Matlab (2014a). \n\n\n#### Altruism task \n  \nThe altruism task was an fMRI compatible version of the dictator game modified from ( ). On every trial, subjects were presented with a monetary proposal that affected their own ($Self) and another persons\u2019 ($Other) monetary payoff ( ). Subjects had 4 s to chose between the on-screen proposal and a constant default allocation ($20 to both) by pressing one of the four response buttons (\u2018strong yes\u2019, \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018no\u2019, \u2018strong no\u2019; direction counter-balanced across subjects). Payouts for self and other ranged from $0 to $40 and always involved a tradeoff between self and other (i.e. prizes for one individual were equal or less than the default, while prizes for the other individual exceeded the default). Thus, subjects always had to choose between acting altruistically (benefitting the other at a cost to oneself) or selfishly (benefitting oneself at a cost to the other) on every trial. At the end of the experiment, one trial was randomly selected and implemented according to the subjects\u2019 choice. If subjects failed to respond within 4 s for this trial, both individuals received $0. \n\nSimilar to the food task, subjects performed the task under three different conditions:   Respond Naturally   (\u2018respond as you naturally would\u2019, [NC]),   Focus on Ethics   (\u2018focus on doing the right thing and consider the ethical or moral implications of your choice\u2019, [EC]), or   Focus on Partner   (\u2018focus on your partner\u2019s feelings and how the other person is affected by your choice\u2019, [PC]). Subjects were reminded to always make their choice based on their preference, regardless of the condition. Conditions were implemented in separate blocks of 10 trials each, with the beginning of a new block signaled by a short reminder instruction (4 s). Matching the food task, subjects performed 9 blocks of each condition (i.e., 90 trials per condition and a total of 270 trials), with the block order counter-balanced across subjects and functional runs, with the exception that the first two blocks were always natural choice trials. Choices in these NC blocks were used to estimate a logistic regression [Choice\u00a0=\u00a0w  * $Self\u00a0+\u00a0w  * $Other] and used for a subject-specific selection of 30% of proposals most likely to elicit generous behavior and 30% of proposals likely to elicit selfish behavior. The remaining 40% of trials were randomly chosen from the full proposal space. Practice trials and a quiz prior to scanning verified that subjects were capable and comfortable to make the choice within 4 s. \n\n\n#### Probabilistic choices \n  \nTo decrease experimental demand and to ensure anonymity in the altruism task, subjects were informed that implementation of their choices was probabilistic and that in 40% of trials their choices would be reversed ( ). Subjects were informed that their partner would only know the proposal and the outcome of the randomly chosen trial, but not their decision (i.e., if the outcome was due to the subjects\u2019 choice or a choice reversal). The implementation was as follows: After each choice (jittered delay of 2\u20134 s), an outcome screen (4 s) informed subjects of the implementation of choices (implemented/choice reversal), followed by a jittered inter-trial interval of 1\u20134 s (average of 2 s) before the next choice screen appeared. Computerized control questions during training confirmed that subjects understood the probabilistic nature of the task and that it was still in their best interest to choose according to their individual preferences. In the food task, we matched the probabilistic implantation in the altruism task, and informed participants prior to scanning that their choices would be implemented with 60% probability. \n\nData from an independent behavioral pilot study (N\u00a0=\u00a017, 11 female, M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 24.12 years\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.83) confirmed that choices under almost perfect implementation (90%) closely matched those observed under 60% implementation conditions (within-subject design, all p\u2019s\u00a0>\u00a00.37, uncorrected, for paired t-tests of RTs, percentage of generous and healthy choices). These findings strongly suggest that the probabilistic nature of the task did not systematically alter preference-based choices in both tasks. \n\n\n\n### Behavioral computational model (DDM) \n  \nWe used a multi-attribute extension of the standard drift diffusion model (DDM) ( ;  ) to capture behavior in both the food and altruism task, using a maximum-likelihood procedure similar to that described in ( ) to find the best-fitting parameters (see Appendix 1 \u2013 Drift diffusion model for details). For capturing behavior in the food task, we fit a model using five parameters: two parameters for the weights on tastiness and healthiness, a parameter for non-decision time (NDT) representing perceptual and motor processes, and two parameters specifying the initial height of the choice-determining threshold (b) as well as the exponential decay rate of this threshold toward zero (d) as the time limit for responding approached. For capturing behavior in the altruism task, we fit a model using six parameters: three parameters related to the weights on $Self, $Other, and fairness (\u22121*|$Self - $Other|), as well as parameters related to NDT, b, and d (see   for details). \n\n\n### Functional image acquisition \n  \nFunctional imaging was performed on a 3T MRI scanner (Magnetom Trio, Tim System, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen) equipped with a 32-channel head coil. T2*-weighted functional images were obtained using an echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR\u00a0=\u00a02.5 s, TE\u00a0=\u00a030 ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a085\u00b0, 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 mm, matrix size 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064, 47 axial slices, descending sequential acquisition order). For the altruism task, a maximum of 1521 volumes were acquired. For the food task we acquired 990 volumes. High-resolution T1-weighted structural images were acquired at the end of each scanning session using an MPRAGE sequence (TR\u00a0=\u00a01.5 s, TE\u00a0=\u00a02.91 ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a010\u00b0, TI\u00a0=\u00a0800 ms, 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 mm, matrix size 256 \u00d7 256, 176 slices). \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nFunctional images were analyzed using the statistical parametric mapping software SPM12 ( ) implemented in Matlab. Preprocessing consisted of slice-time correction (reference slice 47), spatial realignment (by first registering each subjects\u2019 data to the first image of each run, then all functional runs were co-registered with each other), and normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) brain template (EPI template). For every subject, we estimated several general linear models (GLMs), using a canonical hemodynamic response function (hrf), and a 128 s high-pass cutoff filter to eliminate low-frequency drifts in the data. \n\n#### Trial-wise estimates of choice phases: GLM1 (food task) and GLM2 (altruism task) \n  \nThese GLMs aimed to identify brain responses that encode trial-by-trial variations in attributes (i.e., foods\u2019 healthiness or tastiness in the food task; payoffs for subjects and confederate and the fairness of the offer in the altruism task) and decision-values (four-point response from \u2018strong no\u2019 to \u2018strong yes\u2019) during choice periods. To this end, these models obtained a trial-wise measure of BOLD responses during food (GLM1) and altruistic choices (GLM2) at the time of the choice. For each subject, GLM1 included a regressor for each choice period (R1-R270) in the food task, lasting from the onset of a food presentation to the button press that represented the choice for the trial. In addition, the model estimated a separate regressor for the outcome phases for each functional run, movement parameters, and run-wise session constants as regressors of no interest. GLM2 mirrored GLM1 and estimated regressors of interest for every altruistic choice (R1-R270), lasting from the onset of the monetary proposal to the button press that signified the choice in this trial. GLM2 also estimated regressors of no interest including outcome phases, movement parameters, and session constants. Estimated responses for the regressors of interest \u2013 the choice periods of each task (R1-R270 from GLM1 and 2, respectively) \u2013 were then used as inputs for the multivariate decoding analyses (support vector regressions, SVRs) described below. \n\n\n#### Neural computational model: within-subject decoding of choice attributes \n  \nThis multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) aimed to identify brain regions that encode trial-by-trial fluctuations of choice-relevant attributes (e.g. foods healthiness, payoff to self) or decision values (four-point response from \u2018strong no\u2019 to \u2018strong yes\u2019), and to assess how current goals affect neural information on the attribute level. Thus, these decoding analyses allowed us to explicitly test if regulation-based changes in   neural   information on choice-relevant variables (e.g., healthiness of foods) matched predictions from the   behavioral   computational model. \n\nFor each choice attribute and each condition, we applied a separate support vector regression (SVR) analysis in combination with a whole-brain \u2018searchlight\u2019 approach ( ). The key advantage of the searchlight decoding approach is that it does not depend on a priori assumptions about informative brain regions and ensures unbiased information mapping throughout the whole brain ( ;  ). For every subject, we defined a sphere with a radius of 4 voxels around a given voxel v  of the measured brain volume ( ;  ;  ;  ) For each of the N voxels within this sphere, we extracted trial-wise parameter estimates of a particular condition (i.e., 90 of the 270 trial-wise regressors of choice periods from GLM1 (food task) or GLM2 (altruism task)). N-dimensional pattern vectors were created separately for each of the 90 trials of the respective fMRI task. Neural pattern vectors for 8 of the 9 task blocks (\u2018training data\u2019) served as input features, with trial-wise values of the attribute (e.g., healthiness rating) as labels of the prediction. The prediction was realized using a linear kernel support vector machine regression ( ) (\u03bd-SVR) with a fixed cost parameter c = 0.01 that was preselected based on previous implementations of this decoding approach ( ;  ;  ;  ). The resulting model provided the basis for the prediction of the trial-wise values of an attribute (e.g. healthiness ratings) of the 10 trials of the remaining task block (\u2018test data\u2019) based on their neural response patterns. This procedure was repeated nine times, always using pattern vectors of a different task block as test data, yielding a 9-fold cross-validation. Predictive information about the choice attribute was defined as the average Fisher\u2019s z-transformed correlation coefficient between the value predicted by the SVR model and the actual values of an attribute in these trials ( ;  ;  ;  ). This decoding accuracy value was assigned to the central voxel of the searchlight. The procedure was repeated for every voxel of the measured brain volume, yielding a three-dimensional decoding accuracy map for every subject, separately for each choice attribute and each condition. Decoding maps were smoothed (6 mm full width at half maximum, FWHM) and submitted to two different random-effects group analyses. \n\nFirst, to establish that neural response patterns encode the current value of a choice-relevant attribute during choices, we averaged subjects\u2019 decoding accuracy maps for a particular attribute obtained in the three conditions (e.g., separate SVRs for healthiness in NC, HC, and TC). Subject-specific average information maps were than used in a random effect second level analysis (single t-test as implemented in SPM) and tested against chance level at a statistical threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 (FWE cluster-corrected, height threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Note that if resulting cluster sizes at this statistical threshold prevented effective functional localization (i.e., clusters that exceeded 6000 voxels), we report results at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE corrected at voxel-level. Second, to examine if predictive neural information on a choice attribute varied systematically across the three conditions of the respective task, we used a repeated measures ANOVA as implemented in SPM. Only regions that passed the statistical threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 (FWE corrected at cluster-level, height threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) are reported. \n\nWe also compared the results of the multivariate SVRs with those of a conventional univariate analysis (see  , and Appendix 1 \u2013 Univariate Analysis of fMRI Data). However, note that multivariate decoding approaches have been prosed to be more sensitive than traditional mass-univariate approaches: because multivariate pattern classifiers take advantage of information encoded across multiple voxels and exploit systematic differences in voxel selectivity within a specific brain region, they have been suggested to detect information that would be missed by conventional analyses ( ). \n\nThere is a potential concern that the some intervals of the response scales for choice attributes (e.g. tastiness) or decision values (\u2018strong no\u2019, \u2018no\u2019, \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018strong yes\u2019) might be subjectively larger than other intervals. While the present data don\u2019t allow ruling out this potential concern, previous implementations of the response scales in both established tasks suggest that the operationalization of attribute-specific judgments and decision values allows to reliably identify value signals in the brain ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n#### Neural computational model: cross-subject decoding of individual differences in regulatory success \n  \nThis multivariate decoding analysis investigated whether neural activation patterns predict individual differences in regulatory success. A cross-subject decoding approach was used to test for information on the   degree   to which cognitive regulation affected attribute weights and choices. Clusters identified in the repeated measures ANOVA (see above) were defined as regions of interest (ROIs). Importantly, a main goal of our study was to test for potential common neural substrates underlying context-sensitive weighting of choice-attributes across choice-domains. Hence, these decoding analyses focused on voxels identified in a formal conjunction of the significant clusters for flexible representations of Healthiness, Tastiness, and $Self (at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE corrected at cluster-level, height threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; see  ). First, we tested if neural activation in this ROI obtained during food choices encodes subject-specific regulation success in the food task, but also in an independent social altruism task. To this end, we extracted parameter estimates for all voxels in the ROI ( ) from subjects first-level GLM1 (food choices) using the contrast image [HC > (NC, TC)] (based on DDM results suggesting differential attribute representations for this comparison,  ). Resulting pattern vectors (one per subject) were used as input features for the prediction and individual difference scores in regulation success served as labels. Regulation success was defined using difference scores in DDM parameters (e.g., \u0394w Tastiness [HC \u2013 (NC, TC)]) and in observed choice behavior (e.g., \u0394Healthy choices [HC \u2013 (NC, TC)]). Predictions used a linear \u03bd-SVR (libSVM) with a fixed cost parameter c\u00a0=\u00a00.01 (similar to within-subject decoding) and a leave-one-subject out approach (yielding a 36-fold cross-validation). Decoding accuracies reflect correlations of the observed and predicted regulation score. Statistical significance was assessed by comparisons to empirical null-distribution (realized by randomly permuting the pairing of subjects\u2019 neural pattern vectors and behavioral regulation scores 1000 times). Only decoding accuracies above the 95th percentile of null-distributions were considered statistically significant ( ). As a sanity check, analyses were repeated training on data obtained during altruistic choices (see  ). \n\nNote that   ROI-based cross-subject   decoding analyses used permutation tests to assess the statistical significance of the predictions instead of simple t-tests (as implemented in SPM) applied to the   whole-brain within-subject   searchlight decoding maps. Regarding the latter, computational costs for estimating empirical null-distributions for several tens of thousands of searchlight analyses - implemented separately for every attribute, decision-value, condition, and subject - prevented us from using permutation tests for whole-brain decoding analyses. However, supplemental analyses that used t-tests to statistically assess ROI-based results yielded similar results as permutation tests, demonstrating that both statistical approaches generate comparable interpretations for the present data. Notably, empirical permutation-based null-distributions for ROIs also confirmed the theoretical chance level of the prediction that underlies statistical inferences for the whole-brain searchlight results (t-tests as implemented in SPM). Nevertheless, statistical tests based on empirical null-distributions can be viewed as superior insofar as they address the potential concern that means and distribution of predictions based on chance alone might vary across brain regions. \n\nNote also that the ROI ( ) used for this analysis was defined based on a fully independent and orthogonal set of tests for altered decoding accuracies across task conditions at the group level. Thus, ROI-selection was not subject to double dipping ( ). \n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5973829, "text_md5": "bcead7bb995e60be02345aae1111b3bb", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 38], "journal": [39, 44], "publication_year": [46, 50], "title": [61, 205], "keywords": [219, 375], "abstract": [388, 1618], "body": [1627, 80925]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 29813018, "doi": "10.7554/eLife.31185", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5973829", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5973829"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5973829\">5973829</a>", "list_title": "PMC5973829  Cognitive regulation alters social and dietary choice by changing attribute representations in domain-general and domain-specific brain circuits"}

Interventions for reactive aggression have largely focused on cognitive control training, which target top-down emotion regulation mechanisms to inhibit aggressive impulses. Recent theory suggests that mindfulness training (MT) improves emotion regulation   via   both top-down and bottom-up neural mechanisms and has thus been proposed as an alternative treatment for aggression. Using this framework, the current pilot study examined how MT impacts functional brain physiology in the regulation of reactive aggression. Participants were randomly assigned to 2 weeks of MT (  n   = 11) or structurally equivalent active coping training (CT) that emphasizes cognitive control (  n   = 12). Following training, participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a retaliatory aggression task, a 16-trial game in which participants could respond to provocation by choosing whether or not to retaliate in the next round. Training groups did not differ in levels of aggression displayed. However, participants assigned to MT exhibited enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) recruitment during punishment events (i.e., the aversive consequence of losing) relative to those receiving active CT. Conversely, the active coping group demonstrated greater dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) activation when deciding how much to retaliate, in line with a bolstered top-down behavior monitoring function. The findings suggest that mindfulness and cognitive control training may regulate aggression   via   different neural circuits and at different temporal stages of the provocation-aggression cycle. \n\n Trial Registration:   identification no. NCT03485807. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAggression, the intention to harm someone against their will, is a serious public health concern. Behavioral treatments have not been universally effective, so it is critical that researchers investigate alternative interventions for preventing or reducing aggressive behavior ( ;  ). Aggression has been typologized into reactive [impulsive and hostile retaliation to perceived threat ( )] and instrumental (primarily goal-driven) subtypes, each with distinct neurocircuit underpinnings and cognitive contributors that may in turn require different therapeutic approaches ( ). Among evidence-based treatments, mindfulness-based interventions show potential for effectively reducing reactive aggression given that mindfulness practice has been linked to changes in neural function within executive control networks, associated with the inhibition of aggressive impulses ( ), and emotion reactivity networks implicated in responsivity to emotional provocation ( ;  ). However, to date no studies have investigated the impact of mindfulness training (MT) on behavioral and neural indices of reactive aggression. \n\n### Mindfulness Training to Reduce Reactive Aggression \n  \nMeta-analyses indicate that anger is a fundamental predictor of violence ( ;  ); thus, violent offenders are frequently referred for anger management. Prevailing research on standardized interventions for anger and aggression has largely focused on the family of cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) ( ), particularly for the management of aggression in children and adolescents (e.g.,  ). Although literature concerning the use of aggression interventions for adults is relatively sparse ( ), meta-analyses of such studies indicate that the most effective programs integrate multiple therapeutic modalities (e.g., psychoeducation, cognitive training, family counseling) ( ). The majority of therapeutic packages rely on cognitive-behavioral approaches ( ), and so it is important to investigate additional therapeutic modalities that may be integrated into existing treatments. One promising adjuvant for the treatment of anger and aggression is MT, which centers on cultivating sustained, non-reactive attention to present moment experiences ( ). Mindfulness has been theoretically positioned as an effective means to attenuate anger and aggression, given that training in non-reactance toward emotional experiences is commonly at the core of secular mindfulness interventions ( ;  ). Accordingly, an emerging body of research has begun to investigate the impact of mindfulness on aggression and associated mechanisms of action. \n\nA wealth of research supports the effects of MT on cognitive and affective systems implicated in internalizing psychological conditions (e.g., depression;  ;  ), and early evidence suggests that such effects may generalize to externalizing behaviors as well, including aggression ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Initial research broadly suggests that mindfulness may reduce aggression   via   improvements in emotion regulation ( ). However, there is little consensus regarding how mindfulness specifically interacts with the cognitive and affective mechanisms of aggression. According to the General Aggression Model (GAM) ( ), aggression is the end product of a multi-stage process in which: (1) a trigger (i.e., provocation) elicits a combination of cognitive and affective reactions; (2) cognitive and affective factors influence appraisal of the situation; and then (3) these factors collectively inform the decision to aggress, either deliberately or impulsively. Neural frameworks of emotion regulation have been used to elaborate on this theory by mapping GAM stages onto distinct neural processes ( ;  ;  ). Emotion regulation can manifest during early stages (e.g., reactivity to provocation)   via   modulation of regions involved in automated emotion reactivity (e.g., amygdala and insula) and valuation [e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)], described as the automated encoding of subjective importance ( ;  ). Conversely, regulation at subsequent stages (e.g., appraisal and decision-making) recruits higher level cortical regions to deliberately re-evaluate the emotion trajectory and (re)consider actions. Acknowledging this theoretical framework, it remains unknown how mindfulness-based interventions alter neural processes of aggression management as it unfolds in real time. \n\nThis aggression model offers two temporal points for intervention to prevent an aggressive response to provocation, each with potentially different neuroanatomical substrates. First, cognitive training may promote the inhibition of aggression by improving capacity to reappraise provoking stimuli as a means to mitigate emotional impact. Such cognitive strategies implicate \u201ctop-down\u201d neural circuitry in which prefrontal cortical engagement supports deliberate choice selection ( ). Conversely, cognitive training could downregulate the initial emotional impact of provocation by tamping down \u201cbottom-up\u201d processes that operate at relatively short time scales ( ). Although several cognitive therapies may affect longer-scale \u201ctop-down\u201d evaluative processes for retaliation, unique to MT, however, is the goal to disrupt initial reactivity to internal stimuli (e.g., thoughts and feelings) and environmental stimuli (e.g., others\u2019 behavior) before cognitive change strategies like reappraisal are required ( ;  ;  ). Although mindfulness and cognitive training programs have been similarly linked to improvements in top-down regulation (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ), mindfulness exclusively has been shown to target bottom-up pathways. \n\nBy practicing mindfulness in the context of emotional provocation, individuals learn to attend to unpleasant sensations without elaboration or judgment. Evidence suggests that with time, this practice can increase tolerance of difficult emotions, thereby reducing the need to consciously regulate or terminate emotional experiences in order to control them (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). Thus, it is plausible that MT alters bottom-up emotional reactivity to provocation, thus circumventing the use of emotion regulation strategies like reappraisal at later stages. This perspective is bolstered by research showing mindfulness to reduce physiological indicators of anger (e.g., respiration rate, heart rate, blood pressure) ( ) and anger rumination ( ;  ) in the face of provocation. Despite these initial findings, stronger conclusions necessitate experimental approaches designed to isolate top-down from bottom-up processes theoretically implicated in the mindful regulation of aggression. \n\nIn a recent well-controlled study,   examined whether MT could reduce aggression absent improvements in executive functioning. Participants randomly assigned to receive either 3 weeks of training in mindfulness meditation or daily logic assignments completed a lab-based assessment of aggression, during which participants were provoked by a stranger and then given the opportunity to retaliate aggressively. Relative to the control condition, individuals assigned to MT demonstrated significantly less aggressive behavior following provocation. The mindfulness and active control participants exhibited no differences on measures of executive control, suggesting that mindfulness may disrupt the initial generation of aggressive urges, thus circumventing the need to deliberately inhibit aggressive behavior through executive control mechanisms. Moreover, these findings support the position that the mindful regulation of aggression does not necessitate top-down regulation; to the contrary, implicit or bottom-up regulation may be sufficient. We sought to extend this research by examining the neural targets of MT and their association with both bottom-up and top-down regulation of aggression. \n\n\n### Modeling Aggression and Its Regulation Using fMRI \n  \nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a unique opportunity to probe brain mechanisms of mindfulness and other cognitive interventions. Neural mechanisms of aggression have been researched extensively, and neuroimaging methods may be leveraged to investigate the brain-based effects of MT in the context of reactive aggression. Previous neuroimaging research on reactive aggression has prominently featured the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP; e.g.,  ,  ;  ;  ;  ), a laboratory task with strong convergent, discriminant, and external validity ( ). Notably, TAP indices have also been associated with self-reported measures of physical aggression ( ). During the TAP participants compete against an ostensible opponent (actually a computer program) in a reaction time task. If the participant wins a trial, their ostensible opponent receives an aversive noise blast, the intensity of which is chosen by the participant. If the participant loses, they receive a noise blast at a volume level selected by the ostensible opponent. Because the opponent\u2019s behaviors are pre-programmed, multiple levels of provocation can be simulated. By incorporating the TAP task into fMRI designs, researchers are able to evaluate neural indicators associated with reactive, or provoked aggression. Notably, the TAP allows researchers to dissociate neural reactions associated with each trial\u2019s decision phase, in which the participant chooses a level of noise to administer, from neural reactivity associated with responses to opponent provocation or delivery of punishment (i.e., noxious stimuli) to the participant. \n\nInvestigation of these distinct phases may plausibly be applied to the isolation of emotion regulation mechanisms, with neural activity from the decision phase and the outcome phase corresponding to top-down and bottom-up mechanisms respectively. However, very few studies to date have reported neurocircuit recruitment during the provocation or outcome phase independent of the decision phase but see  ;  ;  . This is a critical gap in that mechanisms of aggressive responding, namely emotion reactivity and decision making, relate to dissociable biological pathways ( ), and aggression interventions may be tailored to target distinct neural and behavioral trajectories. This distinction may be particularly relevant in the context of provocation, given that top-down strategies are cognitively demanding and challenging to deploy within the short timescales of high intensity emotions ( ) or during cognitive fatigue ( ). Thus bottom-up emotion regulation, such as may be conferred by mindfulness, may provide an advantage by reducing emotional responses in aggressive contexts without requiring, and by extension, reducing demand for top-down regulatory control. \n\nAlthough findings differ across studies, the decision phase of the TAP has commonly been associated with engagement of the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC), and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) ( ). Broadly implicated in cognitive control (i.e., the inhibition of retaliation) and mentalization, these cortical regions theoretically support top-down regulation strategies, including emotion control and response selection, to deliberately inhibit aggressive action ( ;  ). Moreover, these regions exhibit top-down functional and anatomical projections to subcortical (e.g., amygdala and insula) and cortical regions (e.g., vmPFC) ( ) associated with impulsive emotional responding ( ). \n\nThe accumulation of research suggests that higher level cortical regions facilitate the downregulation of anger reactivity thereby promoting behavioral control over aggressive impulses ( ). However, -less is known about the influence of bottom-up processes, especially given that the majority of fMRI studies do not investigate the provocation or punishment phases (i.e., losing outcome phase) directly ( ). In an exception to this trend,   demonstrated that the punishment phase was associated with activation from the vmPFC, a region implicated in the regulation of threat response ( ;  ) and safety-signaling ( ), defined as the implicit downregulation of distress to noxious stimuli. Collectively reports of neural engagement during the provocation and punishment phases suggest that implicit regulation   via   bottom-up processes is relevant for the emotion regulation of aggression. If MT indeed enhances bottom-up regulation of aggression, it follows that mindfulness will engage neural regions associated with implicit emotion regulation, particularly the vmPFC, during phases preceding the decision to aggress, namely, the provocation or punishment phases of the TAP. \n\n\n### The Present Study \n  \nEmerging research highlights mindfulness as a promising alternative to downregulating reactive aggression. While neuroimaging evidence suggests that MT modifies neural networks relevant to emotional reactivity and regulation (e.g.,  ;  ;  ), no research has examined mindfulness-related neural mechanisms of reactive aggression. To address this question, the present pilot study investigated neural processes implicated in the initiation of, and response to reactive aggression among participants who completed MT. Participants were randomly assigned to 2 weeks of smartphone-delivered MT or to a structurally equivalent coping training (CT), the latter providing an active, well-matched control condition ( ,  ,  ,  ). The CT program, designed to train skills in top-down regulation strategies (including reappraisal and reframing) is well-suited to the present investigation. While distinct from mindfulness-related strategies, cognitive-heavy strategies similarly target emotion-behavior trajectories, to intercept a progression from perceived provocation to retaliation. Thus, comparison of these closely matched programs allowed us to disambiguate their common and divergent effects. We theorized that in the context of aggression regulation, mindfulness and cognitive training would similarly improve top-down control, detected during the TAP\u2019s decision phase. However, unlike cognitive-based regulation, the implicit regulation conferred by mindfulness would ostensibly disrupt initial reactivity to provocation and punishment, thereby reducing the need for later-stage, controlled regulation. Hence the present study had three aims. \n\nThe first aim was to investigate the effects of MT on neural indicators of top-down cognitive control characterized by enhanced activation from inhibitory network regions (e.g., dlPFC, vlPFC, and dmPFC) when deciding whether or not to retaliate (i.e., the decision phase). The second aim was to explore the effects of MT on bottom-up emotional reactivity to being aggressed against (i.e., provocation and punishment phases), as indicated by enhanced activation from regions implicated in emotional significance and motivational value (e.g., limbic structures, vmPFC). Finally, to build upon prior research examining MT effects on behavioral indexes of aggression (e.g.,  ), the third aim was to evaluate the effects of MT, relative to active control training, on a behavioral indicator of reactive aggression, operationalized as average levels of noise chosen on retaliatory trials of the TAP (high noise levels chosen by the ostensible opponent) and non-retaliatory trials (low noise levels chosen by ostensible opponent). \n\n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were 23 healthy, meditation-naive adults recruited from the Richmond, Virginia area. Prospective participants were pre-screened using an internet-administered survey and were considered for inclusion if they spoke fluent English, demonstrated access to a data-enabled smartphone and, for other study purposes, reported greater than average levels of stress over the past month as operationalized by scores of \u22655 on the 4-item version of the Perceived Stress Scale ( ;  ). Participants were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: major uncorrected sensory impairments or cognitive deficits, pregnancy, left-hand dominance, diagnosis of medical or psychiatric illness within the last 3 months, hospitalization within the last 3 months, change in medication regimen within the last 8 weeks, self-reported current drug abuse, presence of MRI safety risks (e.g., ferromagnetic implants, body weight > 300 lbs.), or a history of head trauma or seizures. All participants provided written informed consent to take part in the study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Virginia Commonwealth University and registered with   (Identification No. NCT03485807). Of the 23 participants who completed training, two were lost to post-training assessment and one was excluded from analyses due to excess movement during fMRI acquisition of the TAP task. Demographic characteristics of the final sample are shown in . Preliminary analysis determined that mindfulness and CT groups did not significantly differ in terms of age, gender, race, marital status, income, or education, nor for treatment credibility/expectancy (all   ps   > .09). \n  \nBaseline characteristics of mindfulness and active coping conditions. \n    \n\n### Procedure \n  \nAfter providing written informed consent in an initial laboratory visit, participants completed a Qualtrics software-housed battery of self-report measures and a baseline fMRI assessment during which they completed an anatomical scan, a resting state functional scan, and other tasks for study purposes outside the scope of this report. Following these assessments, participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two 14-lesson smartphone-based interventions (one lesson per day for 14 consecutive days;  ,  ,  ,  ) delivering either MT or active CT. Participants returned to the brain imaging facility within 1\u20135 days of completing the final lesson of their training program. There, participants underwent a 45-min fMRI session during which participants completed an anatomical scan, a resting state functional scan, and the TAP retaliatory aggression task. Following the brain imaging session, participants completed follow-up questionnaires before being debriefed and dismissed. \n\n#### Intervention Programs \n  \nThe present study used a two-arm intervention design previously used to establish the efficacy of brief remote-delivered MT for stress reduction ( ). In addition to reducing subjective and biological markers of stress reactivity ( ), this MT program has been shown to reduce negative affect ( ), increase positive affect ( ), and improve social connectedness ( ). Relative to the mindfulness program, the active coping control program has been shown to minimally reduce stress, improve negative (but not positive) affect, and increase social connectedness ( ,  ,  ). Although the effects of these training programs on social and emotional wellbeing have been established, this study is the first to examine their impact on anger and aggression outcomes. \n\nParticipants assigned to MT received instruction in present-centered, receptive attention with a focus on developing equanimity toward ongoing experiences, while participants assigned to the control condition received instruction in cognitive reframing and reappraisal strategies as well as guided imagery and problem-solving. The interventions were structurally equivalent and delivered   via   audio recordings from the same instructor. Each daily lesson was 15\u201320 min in length and included daily brief homework assignments (3\u201310 min per day). Each lesson taught specific techniques through didactic explanation, guided practice, and brief daily assignments designed to integrate mindfulness and coping skills into day-to-day experiences [see   for full training protocol]. Research assistants monitored daily progress to ensure lesson compliance and participants were encouraged to text or call a study hotline to ask questions or resolve technical issues. Research assistants contacted participants by phone on days 3 and 9 of their intervention to address difficulties or training-specific questions and encourage participant adherence. \n\n\n#### Taylor Aggression Paradigm \n  \nTo investigate the role of MT in altering neural signatures of retaliatory aggression, we administered a version of the TAP adapted for the fMRI scanner (e.g.,  ;  ). Recent research supports flexible use of the TAP, as it has shown to be psychometrically robust to variations in sampling, laboratory settings, and analytical approaches ( ;  ). Participants were informed that they would play an online computerized game with a participant situated in another lab. Participants were told that they would compete in multiple trials of a reaction time competition, in which the loser of each trial received an aversive noise blast through headphones, at one of four noise levels chosen by the other player. In reality, participants played against a preset computer program designed to produce four volume levels of white noise, with volume settings ranging from 1 (60 dB) to 4 (105 dB), in 22.5 dB intervals. The TAP consisted of 16 trials ( ). Each trial began with a fixation phase, followed by a decision phase, in which participants selected the volume of noise blast that their partner would receive if their partner lost the reaction time trial. Participants then viewed a fixation cross with a jittered duration (0.5/1.0/1.5 s) before the competition phase, during which participants were required to quickly press a button when a red square target was shown on-screen (5 s). Participants then viewed their opponent\u2019s (pre-programmed) volume setting. This time point of notification, when the participant perceived the opponent\u2019s intended noise blast setting, was modeled as the provocation phase (see  ). Finally, in the outcome phase, participants learned whether they won or lost the trial. The \u201closing\u201d outcome phase, modeled as the punishment phase, subjected participants to a 5 s noise blast delivered by their opponent. Trials were characterized as retaliatory if they followed trials with high provocation (noise levels 3 or 4) and non-retaliatory if they followed trials with low provocation (levels 1 or 2). The 16-trial task contained eight retaliatory and eight non-retaliatory trials that were randomized across participants. Wins and losses were also randomly ordered across participants. Participants practiced the task first outside of the scanner to provide an opportunity for subjective evaluation of each noise level prior to neuroimaging assessment. \n  \nSingle trial of the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP), showing a loss outcome (i.e., punishment) with a high level of provocation. \n  \nFollowing neuroimaging assessment, participants received self-report questionnaires assessing TAP-associated emotional reactivity and motivation to aggress. Participants completed the Aggressive Motives Scale (AMS) ( ), a 6-item scale measuring desire to harm their opponent during completion of the TAP. We also administered an adapted version of the Aggressive Pleasure Scale (APS) ( ), a 38-item self-report index of positive emotions (e.g., excited, proud) and negative emotions (e.g., distressed, ashamed) felt by the participant when their opponent received the noise blast. \n\n\n#### MRI Acquisition and Preprocessing \n  \nImaging was performed using a 3.0-T Phillips Ingenia MRI scanner. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals were acquired using a T2 -sensitive echoplanar sequence with a repetition time (TR) = 2,500 ms, echo time (TE) = 28 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, matrix size = 64 \u00d7 61, and field of view (FOV) = 224 mm. Each time series dataset contained a total of 213 volumes after removing the initial eight dummy volumes from analysis. Each functional volume contained 40 3.5-mm-thick parallel transverse slices. Structural scans were acquired using a T1-weighted MP-RAGE sequence (1 mm  isotropic voxel size, TR = 2,500 ms, TE = 28 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, matrix size = 240 \u00d7 256, FOV = 240 mm) to facilitate registration to native space. Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) software ( ,  ) was used to conduct all preprocessing and fMRI analyses. Individual time series datasets were despiked to compensate for motion artifacts, corrected for head motion (3dvolreg) with reference set to the middle volume, warped out to common stereotactic reference space (Montreal Neurological Institute; MNI), and spatially smoothed to uniform 6 mm full-width half maximum Gaussian kernel. Motion displacement reports were inspected in order to censor volumes exceeding \u00b1 0.3 mm displacement in the   x  ,   y  , or   z   directions. \n\n\n\n### Statistical Analyses \n  \n#### Behavioral Data Analyses \n  \nBehavioral aggression was operationalized as participants\u2019 noise volume selection (levels 1\u20134) during the decision phase of each trial. Volume selection was divided for analysis into retaliatory or non-retaliatory aggression trials, reflecting whether high or low noise levels, respectively, were chosen by the ostensible opponent on the immediately prior trial. To examine aggression across the 16 trials, multilevel models were constructed, which permitted control of within-person response variability across trials and, for exploratory purposes, examination of trajectories of response across trials. Analyses were conducted using SAS PROC MIXED ( ;  ). \n\n\n#### MRI Data Analyses \n  \n##### Whole-Brain Analyses \n  \nFunctional neuroimaging data were analyzed using GLM as implemented by AFNI\u2019s program, 3dDeconvolve ( ,  ). The multiple linear regression model included removal of mean, linear, and quadratic trends, and motion-related variance in the BOLD signal. Regressors for aggression, provocation, win trials, and loss trials were convolved with the gamma variate model ( ) of the hemodynamic response function. Linear contrasts were calculated to compare each condition against an implicit baseline [decision phase > baseline; provocation > baseline; outcome phase win > baseline; outcome phase lose (i.e., punishment) > baseline]. Cross presentation events and competition events were modeled as baseline parameters. Resulting contrast images were linearly registered to native space structural volumes before being spatially normalized to MNI stereotaxic space. Individual contrast volumes were submitted to a group-level, mixed-effects analysis using 3dMEMA ( ,  ). Clusterwise thresholding was implemented using second nearest neighbor clustering (3dClustSim) with a minimum cluster size of 20 voxels. Uncorrected   p   and FDR-corrected   q   were thresholded at 0.005 and 0.05 respectively. \n\n\n##### Trial-by-Trial Parametric Analysis \n  \nThe TAP applies an iterative or repeated-measures approach to operationalize reactive aggression ( ). Such iterative measures maintain the advantage of modeling ecologically valid social encounters of aggression, in which two parties have multiple opportunities to retaliate, and potentially escalate to higher levels of aggressive responding. In this vein, multilevel modeling (MLM) approaches have been proposed as an additional or alternative approach to examine trajectories of neural responses across TAP trials ( ). Thus, we conducted additional analyses using a multilevel modeling (MLM) framework to examine trajectories of neural activity (beta values) within regions showing significant group-level variation in whole-brain analyses. \n\nA multivariate technique developed by   was adapted to model neural activation for every stage of every trial using separate covariates. First-level regression equations modeled each event of the 16-trial paradigm. Thus, 59 parameters of interest (5 baseline; 54 signal) were entered into the GLM corresponding to beta weights for 16 decision events, 16 provocation events, eight losing events, and eight winning events. The resulting parameter estimates (beta values) were sorted into their corresponding stages to form a beta series for each stage, with beta values representing estimated BOLD activity of each voxel relative to baseline. Beta series for each phase were extracted from voxels within 4 mm spherical regions of interest (ROIs), centered on peak activation voxels derived from significant clusters of the whole brain analysis. \n\nMultilevel analyses of the beta series were conducted in SAS 9.4 PROC MIXED ( ). Multilevel modeling allows time serial data to be retained in its temporal form (in this case, the beta series). Thereby, within-subject variability is modeled rather than treated as error, the latter a consequence of aggregation. This modeling permits more strongly powered analyses, among other advantages, including the retention of participant data wherein missingness is found in the time series. Optimal variance-covariance structure (unstructured, variance components, Toeplitz, compound symmetry, or autoregressive) was determined through chi-square tests comparing the \u20132 restricted log likelihood model fit indices for each outcome. A compound symmetry variance-covariance structure was supported in both models reported below. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Taylor Aggression Paradigm Behavioral Responses \n  \nAnalyses first examined the effects of mindfulness (MT) vs. active CT on behavioral aggression. As anticipated from prior research ( ), MLM analyses showed there was a main effect of provocation level on behavioral aggression, such that high levels of provocation elicited higher retaliation on subsequent trials (MT   M   = 2.44, SD = 1.22; CT   M   = 2.03, SD = 0.77) than did low levels of provocation (MT   M   = 1.89, SD = 1.14; CT   M   = 1.91, SD = 0.79),   b   = \u22120.267, SE = 0.070,   p   = 0.001 (95% CI = \u22120.416, \u22120.122). There was no main effect of training condition on behavioral aggression, such that across both high provocation and low provocation trials, MT and CT participants did not differ in noise levels chosen [  b   = 0.126, SE = 0.436,   p   = 0.777 (95% CI = \u22120.791, 1.042)]. There was also no interaction between training condition and provocation level on levels of noise chosen [  b   = \u22120.042, SE = 0.142,   p   = 0.769 (95% CI = \u22120.320, 0.237)]. \n\nPost-session self-report questionnaires were used to examine associations between emotion-motivational processes and establish that the TAP paradigm elicited emotion-motivation processes, and that such processes affected behavioral aggression. Aggressive motives (AMS) scores (  M   = 2.15, SD = 1.06) were positively correlated with behavioral aggression during both high provocation,   r  (18) = 0.60,   p   = 0.001, and low provocation trials,   r  (18) = 0.651,   p   = 0.002. Similarly, evaluation of the Aggressive Pleasure Scale (APS) indicated that experiencing pleasurable emotions during win trials (  M   = 3.71, SD = 1.39) was positively correlated with behavioral aggression at both high [  r  (18) = 0.449,   p   = 0.047] and low levels of provocation [  r  (18) = 0.622,   p   = 0.003], respectively. Self-reported negative emotion during win trials was not significantly associated with any behavioral measures of aggression (  p   > 0.05). There was no effect of training on AMS scores [  t  (18) = 1.291,   p   = 0.213] or APS scores, for either positive or negative emotion reactivity,   t  (18) = 1.083,   p   = 0.293 and   t  (18) = \u22120.856,   p   = 0.40 respectively. \n\n\n### Taylor Aggression Paradigm Whole-Brain Responses \n  \nSignificant activation clusters elicited by each phase of the TAP are reported in   according to phase of the task. Of particular interest to this study were condition differences during the decision phase and the losing outcome (i.e., punishment) phase. \n  \nFMRI BOLD responses across four phases of the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP). \n    \n#### Decision Phase \n  \nTo examine how BOLD activity during the TAP decision phase varied as a function of training assignment (MT vs. CT), linear contrasts for this phase were submitted to a whole-brain groupwise regression. The MT and CT groups exhibited significant differences during the decision phase, such that relative to MT, CT (CT > MT) participants exhibited greater recruitment from the dmPFC region (peak   t   = 3.65,   k   = 54; FDR-corrected   q   < 0.05, uncorrected   p   < 0.005, \u03b2 = 0.11, peak MNI = 0, 28, 41; see  ). Whole-brain analysis of the decision phase revealed no significant effect of training condition on bilateral dlPFC or vlPFC activity, FDR-corrected   q   > 0.05. \n  \nfMRI BOLD responses during decision to aggress with coping training condition exhibiting greater dmPFC activation relative to the mindfulness training condition. \n  \n\n#### Outcome Phase \n  \nThe training groups did not show differing activations during the win trials of the outcome phase (uncorrected   p   > 0.01). However, assessment of condition differences within loss trials of the outcome phase (i.e., punishment events) revealed significantly greater activity from MT participants relative to CT participants localized to the right vmPFC (peak   t   = 3.70,   k   = 20; FDR-corrected   q   < 0.05, uncorrected   p   < 0.005, \u03b2 = 0.17, peak MNI = 13, 44, \u22123; see  ). Additionally, and unexpectedly, as   shows, punishment events were also characterized by group differences localized to the left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), such that MT participants exhibited greater ITG activation relative to CT participants (peak   t   = 3.73,   k   = 20; FDR-corrected   q   < 0.05, uncorrected   p   < 0.005, \u03b2 = 0.67, peak MNI = \u221245, 11, \u221245). \n  \nfMRI BOLD responses corresponding to loss trials of the outcome phase, with the mindfulness training condition exhibiting greater right vmPFC activity relative to the coping training condition. \n  \n\n#### Provocation Phase \n  \n also shows that training condition differences in ITG activation were found in the provocation phase of the TAP trials. Whole-brain contrasts indicated that MT participants exhibited greater right ITG activation relative to CT participants (peak   t   = 4.31, FDR-corrected   q   < 0.05, uncorrected   p   < 0.001, \u03b2 = 0.50, peak MNI = 44, \u22129, \u221245). Group contrasts also revealed a significant cluster localized to the cerebellum, such that CT participants exhibited greater engagement relative to MT participants (peak   t   = 3.81, FDR-corrected   q   < 0.05, uncorrected   p   < 0.005, \u03b2 = 0.18, peak MNI = 0, \u221269, \u22123). \n\n\n\n### Complementary ROI Analyses \n  \nTo confirm the main results regarding training condition differences in dmPFC and vmPFC, and to determine if neural activation varied across trials of the TAP, we constructed two multilevel models (MLMs) to examine decision phase and outcome phase beta series from voxels within ROIs derived from significant clusters of the whole-brain analysis. Using the decision phase beta series, a preliminary model that included main effects of retaliation, training condition, and trial number, and retaliation \u00d7 training, and trial number \u00d7 training interaction terms showed no interaction between retaliation and training condition (  p   = 0.643). Nor was an interaction between trial number and training condition found (  p   = 0.700). Thus these interaction terms were removed for the main models, which included only the main effects indicated above. As with the whole-brain analyses, MLM indicated a significant main effect of training type on left dmPFC activity (\u22126, 30, 38) during the decision phase [  b   = 0.070, SE = 0.021,   p   = 0.004, (95% CI = 0.026, 0.114)], with the CT group exhibiting significantly greater activity relative to the MT group. Examination of the 16 individual trials revealed that this condition effect was largely driven by trials in the middle of the TAP task (see  ). However, there was no significant main effect of trial number (  p   = 0.515) nor retaliation trial type (  p   = 0.968). \n  \nBetween-condition BOLD activation within the dmPFC varies across the decision phase of each trial. \n  \nTurning to the second MLM analysis, concerning right vmPFC activity during the outcome phase, a preliminary MLM on loss trials that included main effects of training condition, trial number, and their interaction showed no training condition \u00d7 trial interaction (  p   = 0.600) so was not further considered. In the main model, which included training condition and trial number as predictors, a main effect of training condition on right vmPFC activity was found [  b   = \u22120.132, SE = 0.056,   p   = 0.028, (95% CI = \u22120.249, \u22120.016)], with the MT group exhibiting significantly greater activity relative to the CT group. Examination of the eight individual loss trials ( ) revealed that the beta series for each condition was mostly stable across trials of the task, and no main effect of trial was found (  p   = 0.462). Together, these MLM results support the whole-brain analyses reported earlier. \n  \nBetween-condition BOLD activation within the right vmPFC varies across the loss outcome phase of each trial. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAggression arises from heterogeneous sources of emotion dysregulation ( ;  ); thus, it is critical to understand how different interventions uniquely target cognitive and affective systems implicated in aggression. Results of the present study suggest that MT, relative to training in cognitive coping skills, may target unique neural trajectories in the regulation of retaliatory aggression. As anticipated, condition differences were found in both the losing phase of the TAP as well as the decision phase, associated with bottom-up regulation and top-down regulation, respectively. Although groups did not significantly differ in terms of behavioral aggression, these results lend support for neural substrates theoretically involved in different interventions for retaliatory aggression. \n\n### Decision Phase \n  \nParticipants in the CT condition, relative to the MT group, exhibited greater recruitment from the dmPFC during the decision phase of the TAP. This finding was examined more closely using trial-by-trial parametric analysis ( ), which revealed that participants assigned to CT exhibited left dmPFC activity predominantly during middle trials of the task. The dmPFC is among prefrontal cortical structures that have previously been associated with domain-general cognitive control processes ( ;  ), and more specifically with the control of impulsive aggression ( ). Consistent with the findings presented here, prior research suggests that cognitive reappraisal \u2013 a skill central to the CT program \u2013 enhances recruitment from cognitive control regions, including the dmPFC ( ). In addition to its association with cognitive control, the dmPFC theoretically supports modulation of semantic representations (i.e., reappraisal of emotional stimuli)   via   connections to the lateral temporal cortex ( ). Hence, it is plausible that those trained in CT demonstrated increased capacity to alter representations of emotional stimuli (i.e., noise provocation) when deciding whether or not to retaliate. \n\nAlthough the dlPFC and vlPFC are similarly implicated in cognitive control of aggression ( ), activation from these regions did not significantly differ between the CT and MT groups. These null results may be the product of overlapping mechanistic effects of CT and MT treatments. Previous research has shown MT to enhance activity in lateralized PFC regions ( ,  ) ostensibly associated with meta-cognitive skills ( ;  ) which, while mechanistically unique to reappraisal skills, may similarly engage systems implicated in mindfulness. However, such conclusions necessitate further experimental research. \n\n\n### Provocation and Punishment Phases \n  \nResults specific to the loss outcome (i.e., punishment) phase indicated significantly greater vmPFC engagement from participants assigned to MT relative to those assigned to CT. Although the vmPFC supports multiple functions including valuation, decision-making, and social cognition ( ), its role in the regulation of aggression may potentially be informed by the nature of social punishment modeled in the loss outcome trials Recent research indicates that the vmPFC is likely implicated in multiple mechanistic pathways of reactive aggression ( ), specifically threat reactivity and frustration ( ). The involvement of the vmPFC in threat-related neurocircuitry is well-documented in both animal and human models. For example, research in rodents suggests that the vmPFC can implicitly downregulate threat responses (i.e., suppressing conditioned fear responses)   via   inhibition of the amygdala ( ), and human fMRI studies similarly implicate vmPFC neurocircuitry in the regulation of fear ( ;  ) and enhancement of learned safety ( ). Alternative models, positioning the vmPFC within reward neurocircuitry (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ), suggest that vmPFC engagement may mediate the cost-benefit analysis needed to disengage from a retaliatory response ( ;  ). In this respect, the vmPFC may reflect awareness of the implications of retaliatory aggression, thereby enabling adaptive and flexible action. \n\nThe effect of MT on vmPFC engagement during loss trials is consistent with prior models of mindfulness-based emotion regulation. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to reduce habitual emotion reactivity (e.g.,  ;  ,  ;  ), and neuroscientific models posit that such effects are linked to fear extinction processes, facilitated through functional changes within the vmPFC ( ;  ). In the context of social punishment, it is plausible that MT enhances vmPFC engagement in the face of a threatening stimulus (here, an aversive noise blast delivered by a competitor) and consequently reestablishes its emotional value or significance. While less is known regarding the impact of mindfulness on frustration and its mechanisms, MT has been shown to target neural networks relevant to conflict monitoring ( ). Functional changes to such networks, inclusive of the vmPFC, may potentially reduce retaliatory responses to provocation. \n\nNotably, condition differences observed during the loss outcome trials extended to the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), with the MT group exhibiting greater activation compared to the CT group. Moreover, this effect was also present during the provocation phase of the TAP, when participants viewed the level of noise selected by their opponent. Although we did not anticipate that MT would impact ITG activity during any phase of the TAP, this effect potentially informs our explanatory framework. The temporal pole is broadly implicated in the integration of visual and auditory stimuli and exhibits strong anatomical and functional connectivity with limbic regions and the vmPFC ( ). Theoretical frameworks suggest that this functional circuitry may serve to process perceptual information and encode it as (non-semantic) social knowledge ( ). Thus, it is possible that provocation-elicited ITG activation \u2013 operating in concert with the vmPFC \u2013 may underlie formation of emotionally laden social knowledge used to inform action. Such an explanation suggests that MT may enhance non-semantic (i.e., embodied) learning as a strategy to regulate aggression. \n\nMore speculatively, the heightened ITG activity observed here may reflect empathic concern in the context of the provocation-aggression cycle. This point receives some support from research with neurological patients, in which cognitive and affective empathy were critically impaired in those with temporal lobe damage, including but not limited to the ITG ( ). Other work using a theory of mind and empathy task in neurotypical adults found overlapping activation in the ITG, among other regions ( ). Previous research has found higher ITG activation during meditation ( ;  ;  ) and higher gray matter concentration in this region in meditators ( ). However, more research is needed to elucidate both the socio-emotional functions of the ITG and its potential functional and structural plasticity through mindfulness or other forms of mental training. \n\n\n### Behavioral Findings \n  \nRegarding the behavioral results, levels of noise selected during the TAP did not differ between participants assigned to MT vs. CT, where participants from both training conditions responded with significantly higher levels of aggression when their opponent selected high levels of aggression. These findings suggest that the experiment successfully elicited aggression, and consequently, the regulation of aggression. Although we cannot infer that emotion regulation took place from the neuroimaging data, the neural effects reported in this study are consistent with those elicited during the regulation of aggression ( ). Additionally, we note that the similarity in rates of aggressive responding (intensity) between the two groups affords a critical interpretive advantage in that group activation differences were not likely driven by systematic groupwise differences in either schadenfreude (hedonistic pleasure from retaliation) or by systematic group differences in anticipation and apprehension of post-aggression escalation by the fictitious opponent. \n\nIt is also possible that the present findings are a consequence of methodological limitations associated with the TAP, particularly the version adapted to the fMRI context. Specifically, normative levels of aggression on the 4-level version of the TAP are subject to floor effects, given that healthy participants commonly restrict their responses to the lower volume levels (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). The behavioral responses reported here appear to illustrate such consequences of range restriction, as mean scores were uniformly low in both groups. Future research using more sensitive measures (i.e., permitting a greater range of response) may be better able to detect treatment-related effects if indeed present. \n\n\n### Limitations and Future Directions \n  \nThe conclusions drawn from this preliminary study are most notably limited by the small sample size, which reduced the power of the analyses to detect training condition effects. This study was funded by a modest grant, which placed constraints on the number of enrolled participants, who were scanned at pre- and post-training. Nevertheless, the present results inform candidate mechanisms concerning reactive aggression and mindfulness to help guide future research with well-powered samples. A second limitation concerns the cross-sectional design in which neural and behavioral indices of aggression were measured exclusively at post-training neuroimaging assessments. The current study is among the first to examine intervention effects using the TAP task; thus, the impact of habituation or sensitization associated with this task is poorly understood. In order to reduce the influence of possible confounds, we opted against a repeated measure design while attempting to establish baseline group equality using self-reported measures of aggression. While the proof-of-concept design used here aimed to identify candidate neural and behavioral targets of MT, we acknowledge that longitudinal designs are essential for inferring causal inferences. We recommend that future studies expand upon this research using controlled, repeated-measure designs with samples adequately powered to detect effects of interest. Additionally, researchers may consider using a passive control condition to dismantle the unique and overlapping effects of training in mindfulness and active coping strategies as they pertain to aggression interventions. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nTreating aggressive tendencies holds significant import to society. However, research has yet to elucidate the mechanisms of prominent interventions for aggression, including MT. The present preliminary study is among the first to investigate mindfulness-related neural associations of reactive aggression using a standardized laboratory task. The findings provide initial evidence demonstrating that mindfulness and generalized cognitive training may regulate aggression   via   divergent neural circuits and temporal stages of the provocation-aggression cycle. The results extend emotion regulation models of mindfulness ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) by suggesting candidate mechanisms implicated in the regulation of aggression impulses. In particular, this research illustrates how neuroimaging procedures may be used to disambiguate top-down and bottom-up processes, which future research may reveal to be key to downregulating aggressive retaliation. More research in this domain will be relevant for the treatment of reactive aggression, a behavior which is influenced by multiple neural systems implicated in executive and emotional functioning. \n\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in this study are publicly available.

Both synchrony and temporal order judgments are commonly used to investigate synchrony perception between different sensory cues and multisensory perception in general. However, extensive behavioral evidence indicates that these tasks do not measure identical perceptual processes. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how behavioral differences between the tasks are instantiated as neural differences. As these neural differences could manifest at either the sustained (task/state-related) and/or transient (event-related) levels of processing, a mixed block/event-related design was used to investigate the neural response of both time-scales. Clear differences in both sustained and transient BOLD responses were observed between the two tasks, consistent with behavioral differences indeed arising from overlapping but divergent neural mechanisms. Temporal order judgments, but not synchrony judgments, required transient activation in several left hemisphere regions, which may reflect increased task demands caused by an extra stage of processing. Our results highlight that multisensory integration mechanisms can be task dependent, which, in particular, has implications for the study of atypical temporal processing in clinical populations. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTemporal correspondence is a key principle of multisensory integration, thus manipulating the relative timing of the unimodal components (e.g., audio and visual cues) of a cross-modal stimulus is one of the most extensively and widely used tools for investigating multisensory processing. The most commonly used tasks for studying temporal processing, whether in a unimodal or cross-modal context, are synchrony judgment (SJ) and temporal order judgment (TOJ) paradigms. During a SJ task, participants decide whether cues are in synch or out of synch, whereas in a TOJ task, they decide which cue came first (or last). Both tasks allow for the extraction of a point of subjective simultaneity (PSS) and a temporal integration window (TIW) to index temporal processing ability. In their review, Keetels and Vroomen ( ) observed that SJs and TOJs have often been used interchangeably to investigate temporal processing, despite the fact that comparative studies report differences between the tasks. Indeed, accumulating behavioral evidence suggests that these tasks actually measure different processes, or at least different aspects of the same process, even within the same participant for the same stimulus (van Eijk et al.,  ; Vatakis et al.,  ; Fujisaki and Nishida,  ; Petrini et al.,  ; Maier et al.,  ; Vroomen and Stekelenburg,  ; Love et al.,  ). At the group level, the PSS derived from an audiovisual SJ task tends to be visual-leading, i.e., the onset of the visual cue needs to occur before the auditory cue for synchrony to be maximally perceived, whereas when it is derived from TOJ using the same stimuli and participants it is often found to be audio-leading (van Eijk et al.,  ; Petrini et al.,  ; Love et al.,  ). At the individual level, there is no correlation between the two tasks for either PSS or TIW (van Eijk et al.,  ; Vatakis et al.,  ; Fujisaki and Nishida,  ; Vroomen and Stekelenburg,  ; Love et al.,  ). Moreover, improved performance due to training on one of the tasks does not transfer to the other (Mossbridge et al.,  ). Here we aimed to investigate how these differences are manifested in brain activity by examining whether they reflect completely independent temporal processing networks, different levels of activity from the same network, or overlapping (share some mental processes and associated neural architectures) but divergent networks (require specific processes). \n\nSeveral experiments have investigated the neural mechanisms involved in audiovisual SJs (e.g., Miller and D'Esposito,  ; Lewis and Noppeney,  ; Stevenson et al.,  ; Noesselt et al.,  ), but until very recently there was no evidence of the mechanisms involved in audiovisual TOJs, nor any direct comparison of the networks underlying these two tasks. Recently, however, using a simple beep-flash stimulus and an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis, Binder ( ) highlighted several left hemisphere regions (superior/inferior lobule, middle/inferior gyrus and lateral occipital cortex) that activate more during audiovisual TOJs than SJs. Similarly, but in response to unimodal tactile stimulation, Miyazaki et al. ( ) observed more activation for TOJs than SJs in left premotor cortex, left posterior parietal cortex, right premotor cortex and bilateral thalamus. In contrast, within left insular cortex they observed greater activation for SJs than TOJs. These studies were important and timely in reporting differences between TOJs and SJs, nevertheless many questions about the nature of these neural differences are still unanswered. For example, are the differences between TOJ and SJ only evident in overlapping brain regions or do they have divergent neural correlates? Are these differences present for more complex/natural audiovisual stimuli (i.e., stimuli for which we have accumulated prior experience about their visual and auditory correspondence)? Do these neural differences depend on similar or different processing time-scales? \n\nThe current study used a more complex audiovisual stimulus than in Binder ( ) of a point-light drummer (Petrini et al.,  , ; Love et al.,  ) to test the hypothesis that SJs and TOJs have different neural correlates in the human brain. Point-light drumming is formed by a visual and auditory continuous stream of information that is closer to the stimulation we receive in real life compared to simple beep-flash stimuli. Additionally, this stimulus represents a human action but at the same time is similar to Binder ( ) stimulus in terms of low-level characteristics (e.g., white dots appearing on a black background and absence of contextual information). The decision to use a more complex stimulus was necessary to understand whether the neural differences between SJ and TOJ are stimulus dependent as stimulus complexity is known to influence performance (Dixon and Spitz,  ; Vatakis and Spence,  ; Love et al.,  ; Stevenson and Wallace,  ). This in turn would substantiate Binder ( ) findings with simple beep-flash stimuli by extending them to more complex and ecological situations. Indeed, we rarely experience events formed by one isolated visual and auditory stimulus rather we commonly experience complex audiovisual events formed by   streams   of visual and auditory events. Hence, it is essential to examine whether neural differences previously found with single-event simple stimuli extend to more complex everyday situations. \n\nWe used a mixed block/event-related design rather than a simple event-related design because research has demonstrated (e.g., Chawla et al.,  ; Donaldson et al.,  ; Visscher et al.,  ) that two different time-scales of neural activity can be investigated with fMRI: transient (event-related) and sustained (task/state-related) activity. Sustained effects are characterized by rises in the BOLD signal that plateau, or remain elevated, for a significant duration rather than quickly descending back to baseline as would a transient effect. This is an important distinction to make when exploring differences between two related tasks such as SJs and TOJs, as task differences could be explained by different sustained activity (\u201cstates-of-mind\u201d) and/or transient trial-related activity (e.g., decision-making). Standard block and event-related designs pool (confound) these two different levels of processing and prevent their independent investigation (Donaldson,  ), thus limiting our understanding of neural differences between SJ and TOJ tasks. \n\nAs both tasks are involved in temporal processing but show clear behavioral differences, it was predicted that the neural mechanisms underpinning these two tasks would be overlapping but also divergent. That is, that a network of task-independent temporal processing regions would be involved in both tasks along with other task-specific networks dependent on the judgment being made. Such an inherent divergence in the neural mechanisms underpinning the tasks should be evident regardless of the stimulus type being presented. Therefore, despite our use of a more complex stimulus than Binder ( ) convergent overall results between the two studies would be expected. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Experiment overview \n  \nParticipants first completed a pre-fMRI behavioral experiment in which they made SJs and TOJs to synchronous and asynchronous audiovisual stimuli. Dependent on TOJ performance (R  goodness-of-fit between data and fitted function) with the current stimulus, participants were classified, for that stimulus, into one of two groups: TOJ-able (  R   > 0.5) or TOJ-unable (  R   < 0.5). In the following fMRI experiment, participants made SJs and TOJs, but to a reduced stimulus set of synchrony conditions: individually defined task-specific PSSs, largest audio-leading (333 ms), largest video-leading (333 ms), and physically synchronous stimuli. Both TOJ-able and TOJ-unable participants were included in the fMRI experiment as statistical comparisons between these groups could be informative about how and why potential differences between the tasks occur. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nTwenty right-handed participants (10 female, mean age [range] = 24 [20\u201332]) took part. None had received any professional musical training, and all described themselves as \u201cmusical novices.\u201d All had normal or corrected to normal vision and reported no hearing difficulties or any history of neurological disorders. All participants gave informed written consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and were paid for their participation. The University of Glasgow, College of Science and Engineering ethics committee approved the protocol. \n\n\n### Stimulus preparation \n  \nThe stimuli had previously been used in other studies, and a complete description of them can be found elsewhere (Petrini et al.,  , ; Love et al.,  ). They comprised dynamic audiovisual movies (3 s) containing the point-light representation of a drummer playing a swing groove at 120 beats per minute, with an accent on the second beat (Figure  ). Audio and visual cues were shifted relative to each other to produce stimuli with different cue onset asynchrony (COA). The video was shifted to begin either after the audio (\u2212333, \u2212267, \u2212200, \u2212133, and \u221267 ms) or before the audio (+333, +267, +200, +133, and +67 ms), producing a total of 10 asynchronous stimuli to be used in the pre-fMRI experiment. Negative and positive numbers will be used to refer to audio-leading and video-leading COA levels respectively, and 0 COA will refer to the synchronous condition. To prevent participants from having to stay in the MRI scanner for an uncomfortably long time only 4 COA levels were used during the fMRI experiment: two asynchronous (\u2212333, +333 COA) and two \u201csynchronous\u201d (0 COA and the individually defined PSS). The \u2212333, 0 and +333 COA conditions are provided as Supplementary Videos  \u2013 , respectively. \n  \nStimulus illustration and experimental design.   (A)   Static sample frame of the jazz drummer dynamic point-light display. White dots represent the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, grip, and drumstick tip, while the white rectangle represents the drumhead. Faint outlines of the person and drum were not in the actual stimulus and are presented here to help illustrate what the point-lights represent.   (B)   The top row highlights the sequence of events and timing of the fMRI experimental design. The bottom row provides an example of the timing and contents of a stimulation block. In this example Stim-3 is presented 0 times, Stim-1 1 time, Stim-2 3 times, and Stim-4 1 time and each of the 4 possible fixation durations (1, 2, 3, 4 s) are presented in a random order. \n  \nStimuli were presented using MATLAB 2007b (MATHWORKS Inc., Natick, MA) and the Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard,  ; Pelli,  ). \n\n\n### Procedure and analysis of behavioral experiment \n  \nThe behavioral session (~20 min) took place in a darkened room, where participants sat approximately 65 cm from a CRT monitor (FormacProNitron 19.380; 1,024 \u00d7 768 pixel resolution and 60 Hz refresh rate). Auditory cues were presented via Beyerdynamic DT headphones. \n\nThe two-alternative forced-choice experiment consisted of 20 blocks; in half of the blocks participants responded as to whether the audio and video cues were synchronous or not (SJ) and in the other half as to which cue came first (TOJ). Block order was randomized. Instructions describing whether a SJ or a TOJ was to be performed were displayed on screen for 4 s before the beginning of each block. There were 10 trials per COA level for each task. Written instructions emphasized the importance of understanding the difference between the two tasks and that it was crucial to be constantly aware of what the current task was. \n\nBest-fitting Gaussian curves (least squares minimization using iterative maximum likelihood) to the number of synchronous and visual first responses were calculated for the SJ and TOJ data respectively. PSS was derived as the peak of the SJ probability function and as the 50% point of the TOJ cumulative distribution function, while the TIW was taken as the standard deviation of the Gaussian curve for each task (Petrini et al.,  ). Previous research has shown that some participants cannot successfully make TOJs (random responses or responses completely biased toward one response) for some stimulus types (Petrini et al.,  ; Love et al.,  ). In the current study,   R  -values (goodness-of-fit between data and fitted function) below 0.5 were regarded as indicating that a participant could not successfully make the TOJ. This criterion was defined in our previous work as it corresponded well with subjective interpretations of what constituted good and bad data fits (Love et al.,  ). Furthermore, it represents a quantitative, replicable criterion that can be used and compared across experiments. \n\n\n### Procedure and analysis of fMRI experiment \n  \nThe fMRI procedure was similar to the behavioral experiment, except that a reduced stimulus set was presented: \u2212333, 0, PSS, and +333. The PSS values were obtained individually from the pre-fMRI experiment separately for SJ and TOJ. To be as accurate as possible the individual PSS conditions were selected as the closest COA level to that of the PSS value derived from the pre-fMRI data fits. Although COA levels in the pre-fMRI experiment were restricted to \u00b1333, \u00b1267, \u00b1200, \u00b1133, \u00b167, and 0 ms, COA values for the PSS condition in the fMRI experiment could be any COA level between 0 and \u00b1333 in 16 ms increments i.e., one frame at a time. This use of an individually determined stimulus level (PSS) is similar to the approach used by Binder ( ) to determine stimuli levels, but did not use the simultaneity threshold approach based on separate sound-first and flash-first trials. For TOJ-unable participants, we used average results from a behavioral study using identical stimuli (Petrini et al.,  ). An optimized mixed block/event-related design was used to enable investigation of differences between the tasks at both transient and sustained levels of processing. \n\nEach of two functional runs (~22 min each) consisted of 32 stimulation blocks (half SJ and half TOJ, randomized) and after every two stimulation blocks there was a 16 s fixation block (Figure  ). Within a stimulation block (25 s) there were 9 events: 5 stimuli (each 3 s) separated by 4 fixation events (1, 2, 3, or 4 s in pseudorandom order). Each COA condition was presented a total of 40 times (20 per run) per task. To minimize the correlation between the transient (stimuli) and sustained (stimulation block) regressors the number of times an individual COA condition was presented within a single stimulation block was manipulated as follows: in a run, a COA level was presented 0 times during 4 stimulation blocks, once in 6 blocks, twice in 4 blocks and 3 times in 2 blocks, i.e., a total of 20 presentations for each COA level and task. One thousand sequences with different randomizations of the order of events and blocks were created and the best chosen by balancing efficiency and correlation. In the chosen sequence, the mean correlation between sustained and transient regressors was 0.47, which enabled reliable estimation of both types of BOLD response (Otten et al.,  ). \n\nAuditory stimuli were presented via Sensimetrics S14 insert headphones at approximately 85 dB. The visual cue was back-projected (Panasonic PT-D7700E DLP; 1,024 \u00d7 768 pixel resolution, 60 Hz refresh rate) onto a screen behind the participant's head, visible via a mirror mounted on the MR head coil with an approximate viewing distance of 65 cm. \n\nFunctional images covering the whole brain (field of view: 210 mm, number of slices: 32, voxel size: 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm) were acquired with a 3T Tim Trio Scanner (Siemens) and a 32-channel head coil using an echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence (ascending-interleaved, TR: 2 s, TE: 30 ms, flip angle: 77\u00b0). At the end of the fMRI session, high-resolution T1-weighted images (anatomical scan) were obtained (field of view: 256 mm, number of slices: 192, voxel size: 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm, flip angle: 9\u00b0, TR: 1.9 s, TE: 2.52 ms). \n\nSPM8 software (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK) was used to pre-process and analyse the imaging data. First, the anatomical scan was AC-PC centered; this correction was then applied to all EPI volumes. Functional data were slice-time corrected and subsequently motion corrected using a two-pass six-parameter rigid-body spatial transformation (Friston et al.,  ), which realigned all functional volumes to the first volume of the scan closest to the anatomical scan, and subsequently realigned all the images to the mean volume. The anatomical scan was co-registered to the mean volume and segmented. The functional and anatomical images were then normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template using the parameters issued from the segmentation, keeping the voxel resolution of the original scans (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 and 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm respectively). Functional images were smoothed with an 8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. Global linear trends and rapid aliased noise were minimized through high-pass filtering the data with a cutoff period of 128 s and an autoregressive [AR(1)] filter during statistical model estimation. All the analyses were conducted in a masked skull-stripped search volume, created by combining three tissue maps (white and gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid) output at the segmentation procedure. \n\nData were analyzed in a two-level random-effects analysis, with each run entered as a separate session. The first-level analysis involved a design matrix with 18 regressors per session. There were 10 regressors of interest: two for sustained-effects and eight for transient-effects (4 conditions \u00d7 2 tasks). SJ and TOJ sustained-effects were modeled using 25-s boxcar functions; transient-effects were modeled separately for each task and COA level with event-related impulse responses. Both the sustained and the transient regressors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Eight regressors of no interest were included to account for the instruction periods, six realignment motion parameters and the grand mean. \n\nUsing the general linear model, parameter estimates for each regressor were calculated and used to create contrast images for a condition relative to baseline (Friston et al.,  ). The resulting images were used in repeated-measures ANOVAs conducted using the GLM Flex software ( ). The first ANOVA examined any differences in sustained-effects produced by the factors Task (SJ/TOJ) and Group (TOJ-able/TOJ-unable), plus their interaction. The second tested for differences in transient-effects produced by the factors Group (TOJ-able/TOJ-unable), Task (SJ/TOJ), COA Condition (\u2212333/0/PSS/333), and their interactions. We report all clusters that were significant after multiple comparisons correction (  p   < 0.05) based on cluster-extent false discovery rate (Chumbley and Friston,  ) with the auxiliary voxel-level threshold set at   p   < 0.0001. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nIn line with previous research (Petrini et al.,  ; Love et al.,  ), data from the pre-fMRI experiment indicated that some participants could not successfully make TOJs (Figure  ). Eleven out of 20 participants were deemed unable to make TOJs based on an   R   value of < 0.5; from now on they will be referred to as the TOJ-unable group, with the other 9 participants being the TOJ-able group. The mean SJ PSS of all participants was a +70 ms (s.e.m = 5.7) video-leading stimulus, while the mean TOJ PSS from the TOJ-able participants was a \u221255 ms (s.e.m = 24.6) audio-leading stimulus. Paired-samples   t  -tests, using the pre-fMRI data of participants able to achieve both tasks (TOJ-able), highlighted a significant difference (  t   = 3.54,   p   = 0.008) between TOJ and SJ PSS but not TIW (  SJ   = 127 ms [s.e.m = 12], TOJ = 190 ms [s.e.m = 55],   t   = 1.243,   p   = 0.249). Comparison between the TOJ-able and TOJ-unable group using independent-samples   t  -tests indicated there was no difference in SJ PSS (difference 17.8 ms   t   = 1.628,   p   = 0.121) or TIW (difference 30.1 ms   t   = 1.759,   p   = 0.096) between the groups. \n  \nPre-fMRI behavioral data.

Black and gray functions represent TOJ-able and TOJ-unable participants respectively. \n  \nBehavioral responses to the four conditions presented during fMRI scanning are displayed separately for each group and for each task in Figure  . Furthermore, a direct comparison of individual performance inside and outside the MRI environment can be visualized in Supplementary Image  . To compare behavior from pre-fMRI and during fMRI separate 3 Factor (Group: TOJ-able / TOJ-unable X Time: pre-fMRI/fMRI X COA: \u2212333 0 and 333) repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted on the SJ and TOJ data. Both highlighted significant interactions between the Time and COA Factors [SJ:   F   = 20.39,   p   < 0.001; TOJ:   F   = 3.67,   p   < 0.036]. Visual inspection of the data showed that for both SJ and TOJ there was a difference in pre-fMRI and during fMRI performance but only for the +333 COA condition. For the SJ task this difference appeared as a higher proportion of synchronous responses during fMRI and for the TOJ task it appeared as a higher proportion of video-first responses during fMRI. \n  \nfMRI behavioral data.

Significant differences (  p   < 0.05 cluster-corrected) were found between the two tasks at both sustained and transient levels of processing. One region showed a significant difference in sustained activity between the tasks: the left middle occipital cortex (MOC) was activated more by SJ than TOJ. Investigation of percentage signal change relative to baseline also indicates that on average sustained task-related deactivation was observed during TOJ vs. activation during SJ (sustained main-effect of Task, Table   and Figure  ). During transient events, TOJs revealed significantly more activation than SJs in the middle occipital, middle frontal, precuneus and medial superior frontal regions of the left hemisphere (transient main-effect of Task, Table   and Figure  ). Within the right anterior cingulate there was a significant Task by COA Condition interaction driven by larger deactivations to audio- and video-leading conditions than to PSS and 0 COA, but only during TOJs. \n  \nSignificant clusters with peak MNI coordinate, extent, and statistical values. \n  \n Clusters showing a voxel-level FWER p < 0.05 based on peak height (Chumbley and Friston,  ) are indicated by a star (*)  . \n    \nSignificant clusters and individual participants' % signal change from the clusters peak voxel for   (A)   sustained and   (B)   transient main-effects of Task. % signal change was calculated using a scaling factor of 0.132 (Pernet,  ). Clusters are presented on axial or sagittal slices of the MNI152_2009bet (Fonov et al.,  ) template using MRIcroGL ( , 12/12/2012). \n  \nA significant transient main-effect of COA Condition was found in the bilateral putamen, insula, superior temporal cortex, left angular gyrus and anterior cingulate and right superior medial frontal cortex (Table  , Figure  ). While our main focus was on effects of task on brain activity, the significant transient main-effect of COA Condition highlights a network of regions involved in processing temporal information in audiovisual stimuli, regardless of the task performed. \n  \nSignificant clusters and individual participants' % signal change from the clusters peak voxel for the transient main-effect of COA Condition. % signal change was calculated using a scaling factor of 0.132 (Pernet,  ). Clusters are presented on axial or sagittal slices of the MNI152_2009bet (Fonov et al.,  ) template using MRIcroGL ( , 12/12/2012). \n  \nNo other significant main effects or interactions were found. Since the Group factor (TOJ-able/TOJ-unable) did not produce any significant results, we repeated the above analyses with this factor removed. The results were highly consistent with those described, with the addition that the transient TOJ>SJ effects found in the   left   middle occipital and middle frontal cortex were now also observed in the right hemisphere. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the current experiment, the same participants made SJs and TOJs to an   identical   set of synchronous and asynchronous audiovisual point-light-drumming stimuli, while their sustained and transient task-related BOLD responses were recorded using fMRI. The results show that, even under identical stimulus conditions, TOJs and SJs have overlapping (main-effect of COA Condition) but divergent neural correlates for both sustained and transient BOLD responses. This neuroimaging evidence is in support of previous behavioral research indicating that the two tasks measure different processes, or aspects, of temporal processing (e.g., van Eijk et al.,  ; Vatakis et al.,  ; Fujisaki and Nishida,  ; Petrini et al.,  ; Maier et al.,  ; Vroomen and Stekelenburg,  ; Love et al.,  ). The current transient level results are also largely consistent with the results of a recent study which tested a similar hypothesis using an event-related fMRI analysis and single-event, simpler, audiovisual stimuli (Binder,  ). In both the event-related results of Binder ( ) and the current transient effects, no region was more activated during SJs than TOJs, and all regions that activated more to TOJs than SJs were in the left hemisphere. Some of these left hemisphere regions, required during TOJs but not, or at least less so, during SJs, were consistent across studies. For example, both found similar MFG clusters, and there is a likely overlap between the cluster labeled as superior/inferior parietal lobule by Binder ( ) and our MOC cluster. While our results and those of Binder ( ) are consistent the current work also suggests that the difference in neural activity between these two tasks is consistent regardless of the stimulus being processed. This is an important and novel finding as it demonstrates that although behavioral performance on both tasks depends on stimulus type/complexity the overall network differences between them do not. \n\nAlthough we predicted differences in the neural correlates underpinning SJs and TOJs, our design did not preclude finding brain activity common to both tasks. Correspondingly, regions showing sensitivity to COA under both task conditions represent a network for true audiovisual synchrony processing that is independent of task. Notably, we found that COA modulated activity in the bilateral putamen, insula and superior temporal cortex while participants performed either task\u2013all areas previously found to be involved in the processing of audiovisual synchrony either during passive viewing (Calvert et al.,  ), other related tasks (Bushara et al.,  ; Olson et al.,  ) or SJs (Miller and D'Esposito,  ; Stevenson et al.,  ). As similar regions play key roles in unimodal visual (Davis et al.,  ), auditory (von Steinb\u00fcchel et al.,  ), and tactile TOJs (Takahashi et al.,  ), it is possible that these regions represent a network which processes the relative timing of events rather than audiovisual synchrony   per se  . That is, they appear to be modulated by the   relative   timing of events, independent of the stimulated sensory modality or modalities and of the task being performed. \n\nIn contrast to transient level results, SJs produced more sustained activity in the left MOC than TOJs. The percentage signal change data actually indicate however that on average this region deactivated during TOJs (Figure  ). The MOC has previously been found to exhibit task-induced deactivations, i.e., lower BOLD responses during a task than during baseline, and, in addition, these deactivations increase as a function of task difficulty (McKiernan et al.,  ; Hairston et al.,  ). In our previous and current work, we have shown that TOJs are perceived as being more demanding than SJs\u2013a subjective measure that echoes with more objective criteria such as wider TIWs, and larger exclusion rates (Love et al.,  ). Therefore, we propose that the sustained deactivation found in the left MOC is indicative of a reallocation of resources (McKiernan et al.,  ) necessary for an extra stage of processing required during TOJs but not SJs (Ja\u015bkowski,  ; Binder,  ; Miyazaki et al.,  ). \n\nDuring TOJs but not SJs, several regions of the left hemisphere (middle occipital, middle frontal, precuneus and superior medial frontal cortex) displayed increased transient activity compared to baseline. These left-hemisphere results are in line with a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) study, which argued that regions uniquely involved in   visual   TOJs, as compared to relative size judgments, were lateralized in the left-hemisphere (Wencil et al.,  ). In that study, lesions in both the left inferior frontal and left posterior parietal cortex correlated with visual TOJ deficits. Likewise, lesions of the left hemisphere have also been associated with deficits in   auditory   TOJs (von Steinb\u00fcchel et al.,  ; Wittmann et al.,  ). The current experiment and that of Binder ( ) add to these findings by showing that left hemisphere regions were also uniquely involved in   audiovisual   TOJs, even when contrasted with another synchrony-based task. However, it is worth noting that, similarly to Wencil et al. ( ), we are not suggesting TOJs are solely supported by the left hemisphere and SJs by the right hemisphere; indeed, several bilateral regions were activated during both tasks (see Table   and Figure  ). Plus, a left lateralized TOJ>SJ effect should be treated with caution since similar effects were also observed in the   right   hemisphere when the Group factor was removed from the current analysis. Furthermore, despite noting that during tactile stimulation the regions activating more to TOJs than SJs were primarily distributed in the left hemisphere, Miyazaki et al. ( ) also found two such regions in the right hemisphere. Comparing unimodal visual TOJs to a shape discrimination task in two experiments, Davis et al. ( ) found bilateral temporal parietal junction activation to be larger for TOJs in the first experiment, while the same effect was found only in the left hemisphere during the second, better controlled, experiment. Taking all this evidence into consideration it appears prudent to talk about a prevalence of left hemisphere regions being more activated for TOJs than SJs rather than about a lateralization of this effect. \n\nRegardless of whether the extra neural responses required to make TOJs are lateralized or not, they do highlight cognitive processing that is over and above that needed to make SJs. Binder ( ) argued that the additional activation was evidence in favor of a two-stage cognitive processing architecture for TOJs (Ja\u015bkowski,  ), requiring the perception of both (a)synchrony and order\u2013SJs require only the first. Our results are coherent with this argument and further support it by highlighting that   sustained   task-induced deactivation of left MOC may facilitate this extra cognitive processing. This evidence is in opposition to the theory that TOJs can be made using the same information (arrival-time difference between the cues) and cognitive architecture as SJs (Sternberg and Knoll,  ; Allan,  ). Comparison of these two tasks using more time-sensitive neuroimaging techniques, such as electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography, would elucidate whether these stages are conducted serially or in parallel. Use of the VLSM technique to search for a double-dissociation between audiovisual TOJs and SJs, similar to that found between visual TOJs and relative size judgments by Wencil et al. ( ), could also greatly increase our knowledge of the overlapping nature of these two processes. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nOne of the strengths and novelties in our study could also be seen counter intuitively as one of the limitations. As mentioned we used a more ecological and complex stimulus formed by a series of events (nine impact movements and nine resulting sounds) rather than a single, well-defined event (e.g., beep-flash). Having multiple events means that creating the different asynchrony levels between the visual and auditory streams has the effect of realigning sensory inputs at longer COAs. This could have implications and perhaps partly explain the performance of TOJ-unable participants. \n\nHowever, there are several reasons why we do not consider this a limitation. First of all, it is unclear why this realignment would affect more TOJ than SJ. Considering that participants could have used all the events in both tasks to make their judgments we could assume that the effect of a decrease in asynchrony for some events, due to realignment, should have had an influence on both tasks not only TOJ. Second, we would predict that any influence this realignment had on participants' responses should have been seen for both audio and video-leading conditions. However, this was not the case. Hence, though the effect of auditory and visual event realignment in complex stimuli needs to be considered and discussed we do not believe it undermines the task-related effects presented here. Finally, our interpretation is supported by the high level of consistency between our findings and those of Binder ( ) who used a single-event flash and beep stimulus, for which no realignment at larger audiovisual lags could occur. \n\nAnother possible limitation of the current work relates to the relative difficulty of the tasks. In general, when comparing tasks it is prudent to equate difficulty across the tasks. However in reality this is non-trivial, in particular when there is an inherent difference in difficulty between them. Participants in this and our previous work (Love et al.,  ) reported that TOJs were in general more difficult than SJs based on their experience with the tasks for a wide variety of cue onset asynchronies and a wide variety of stimulus types. For simple beep-flash stimuli, for example, we previously (Love et al.,  ) found no quantitative indication of TOJs being more difficult than SJs except for verbal reports, in which 71% of participants thought TOJs were more difficult. This example helps to highlight two different concepts of task difficulty: 1) between-task and 2) within-task difficulty. By within-task difficulty we refer to, for example, performing at a 75% correct level on two different tasks. While difficulty could be believed to be equal in this situation we would argue that this is not necessarily so. For example, it is inherently more difficult to perform at 75% when solving differential equations compared to performing at 75% on a multiplication task. Clearly, there are cases when equating this type of within-task difficulty is not possible. We believe that there is an inherent within-task difficulty difference between SJs and TOJs that cannot easily be equated. Perhaps, as suggested above, this could be due to an extra stage of cognitive processing required for TOJs. That said, it would be informative to compare the two tasks at audio- and video-leading just-noticeable-difference COA levels, as this may be the best control of within-task difficulty. We chose not to do this, as it would lead to different stimulus conditions (COA levels) being presented for each task. In general, behavioral experiments highlighting differences between SJ and TOJ have used identical stimulus conditions to compare the tasks. Here we aimed to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms that reflect the findings of such behavioral work. \n\nAs detailed in section Behavioral Results Behavioral Results, there was a significant difference in group mean behavioral performance for the +333 COA condition dependent on whether it was conducted inside or outside the MRI environment. Furthermore, while it was not possible to statistically compare PSS performance from outside and inside the MRI environment it appears that, at least for some participants, performance on the PSS condition was also affected by the MRI environment (Figure  ). One obvious difference between the experimental procedures in these two situations was the ratio of synchronous to asynchronous conditions presented. In the pre-fMRI experiment multiple asynchronous COA levels were presented whereas during the fMRI experiment an equal number of synchronous (0 COA and PSS) and asynchronous (-333 and +333) COA levels were presented. It is possible that these different experimental contexts influenced behavioral performance. Another possibility is that the noise produced by the MRI scanner made the information from the auditory cue less reliable thus widening the TIW for the participants during the scan, which would result in a lower ability to detect asynchrony particularly when vision led sound. \n\nOur subsample sizes of 9 (TOJ-able group) versus 11 (TOJ-unable group) should be considered as a limitation in the ability to detect differences between the two groups. Indeed no significant differences involving the Group factor were observed. However, our failing to observe significant differences between the groups should not, as with all null results, be interpreted as evidence of no difference. A study designed specifically to test for differences between these two groups involving a larger number of observations per group may well highlight significant differences. Unthresholded statistical maps from the current study ( ) indicate, for example, a possible main-effect of Group in bilateral Putamen and in the right STS. \n\nIn the current fMRI experiment the visual cue was presented on a screen approximately 65 cm from the head of participants, while the auditory cue was presented via headphones. The relative spatial location of the sensory cues of a multisensory stimulus is one of the main factors in regulating multisensory integration mechanisms (Stein and Meredith,  ). We have previously shown that for an SJ task, using headphones or speakers placed next to the screen led to no significant difference in behavioral performance when using the same stimuli used in the present study (Petrini et al.,  ). Therefore, we believe that it is unlikely that this spatial discordance significantly influenced the current results; however, an effect of such spatial discrepancy for TOJs cannot be ruled out. This is a limitation we share with the study by Binder ( ) and it is dictated by the common use of headphones during fMRI studies to reduce background noise. It would be interesting in future studies to ascertain the effect of spatial displacement on both tasks by conducting the TOJ and SJ tasks with both headphones or speakers. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, important differences between the neural correlates of synchrony judgments (SJs) and temporal order judgments (TOJs) have been highlighted at both the sustained and the transient BOLD response levels. The similarity between the current results and those of Binder ( ) provide converging evidence that the divergent neural correlates of these two tasks likely exist regardless of stimulus complexity; however, it is important to also confirm this using contextually natural (not only white dots on a black background) stimuli. We speculate that the more demanding, possibly two-stage, cognitive processing required for TOJs induces a task-induced deactivation of the MOC to reallocate resources to regions required to make the judgment: the middle occipital, middle frontal, precuneus and superior medial frontal cortex. One important conclusion arising from this study is that care must be taken during future attempts to use atypical temporal processing as a diagnostic tool, or to inform the creation of remediation strategies for clinical disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. As SJs and TOJs are underpinned, not only by overlapping, but also by divergent neural mechanisms, atypical processing found for one task may or may not exist for the other (Capa et al.,  ). Neuroimaging studies examining differences in temporal processing between the mentioned clinical populations and the typical developing population could focus on the task unrelated activated regions (e.g., putamen, insula and superior temporal cortex) to identify useful diagnostic markers. \n\n\n## Data availability \n  \nUnthresholded statistical maps were uploaded to NeuroVault.org database and are available at  .

To probe neural responsiveness to anticipated and received rewards in the context of bipolar disorder, we scanned individuals with remitted bipolar I disorder (  n  \u202f=\u202f24) and well-matched controls (  n  \u202f=\u202f24; matched for age and gender) using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRI) during a Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task. Relative to controls, the bipolar group showed reduced NAcc activity during anticipation of gains. Across groups, this blunting correlated with individual differences in impulsive responses to positive emotions (Positive Urgency), which statistically accounted for the association of blunted NAcc activity with bipolar diagnosis. These results suggest that blunted NAcc responses during gain anticipation in the context of bipolar disorder may reflect individual differences in Positive Urgency. These findings may help resolve discrepancies in the literature on neural responses to reward in bipolar disorder, and clarify the relationship between brain activity and the propensity to experience manic episodes. \n \n\n# Body\n \nBipolar disorder ranks among the most severe and costly of psychiatric illnesses, and is accordingly associated with high rates of suicide and general mortality ( ). Heritability estimates for bipolar disorder exceed 80% ( ;  ), which implies underlying physiological mechanisms that might include neural responses to reward ( ;  ). Indeed, early researchers proposed that manic symptoms (i.e., elevated mood, excessive energy, racing thoughts, and enhanced engagement in goal-directed activity) might reflect excessive activity in neural circuits implicated in reward processing ( ). Consistent with this idea, irregularities in dopamine function have been invoked in models of bipolar disorder across a broad range of human and comparative research ( ;  ). Nonetheless, the precise association of activity in neural circuits implicated in reward processing with bipolar disorder remains unclear. \n\nSubstantial behavioral research indicates that people with remitted bipolar disorder show elevated behavioral sensitivity to rewards compared to controls, as reflected in both self-report measures (e.g., Behavioral Activation Scales ( )) and behavioral tasks ( ;  ;  ). Increased behavioral responsiveness to rewards does not merely index manic symptoms, since self-report ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and physiological measures of reward sensitivity ( ;  ;  ) remain elevated even after remission from manic symptoms ( ). Increased behavioral responsiveness to reward is also apparent in individuals with a history of subsyndromal symptoms who have not yet experienced a full-blown manic episode. Longitudinally, behavioral measures of reward sensitivity predict: the onset of bipolar disorder spectrum diagnoses among vulnerable students ( ); conversion to more severe forms of bipolar disorder among diagnosed individuals ( ); and increases in manic symptoms among diagnosed individuals (e.g., over six months) ( ;  ). \n\nBecause individuals at risk for bipolar disorder show increased behavioral responsiveness to reward, theorists have extrapolated that these individuals might also show greater neural sensitivity to reward ( ). Over the past two decades, researchers have used Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRI) in healthy humans to develop tasks capable of consistently eliciting neural responses during both anticipation and receipt of basic as well as abstract rewards ( ). Meta-analyses of these findings consistently implicate activity in brain regions that receive mesolimbic dopamine projections in reward anticipation and receipt ( ;  ). Some of this evidence suggests that ventral striatal regions (including the Nucleus Accumbens or NAcc) respond more prominently to reward anticipation, whereas a region of the Medial PreFrontal Cortex (MPFC) responds more prominently to reward outcomes ( ;  ). Many of these neuroimaging tasks use monetary incentives, which allow researchers to directly contrast anticipation and receipt of monetary gains versus losses, as well as to control for potential confounds related to arousal, salience, attention, and motor demands. Some neural responses during these tasks also show temporal stability (e.g., over > 2 years), suggesting that they might serve as reliable \u201cneurophenotypic\u201d markers of psychiatric symptom profiles ( ). More recent translational work further implies that neural responses to reward cues may be related to phasic dopamine release, since optogenetic stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons in awake rats generates a pattern of increased striatal FMRI activity that matches neural activity observed in humans as they anticipate monetary rewards ( ). \n\nSeveral neuroimaging studies have used these incentive tasks to probe neural responses to reward in the context of bipolar disorder. Consistent with behavioral findings, reviews of this growing literature have concluded that individuals with bipolar disorder are \u201c\u2026characterized by elevated activation in a fronto-striatal reward neural circuit\u2026\u201d ( ) (see also  ). Scrutiny of these collected findings, however, suggests that such an intuitive conclusion may be premature. Results from several FMRI studies utilizing monetary incentive tasks in the context of bipolar disorder, for instance, paint a more variable picture ( ;   k  \u202f=\u202f15 studies; omitting studies using other scanning techniques such as electroencephalography or positron emission tomography, focusing on youth ( ;  ), or including previously-published data ( )). Specifically, focusing on the most commonly studied condition of reward anticipation, qualitative comparison of these findings suggests that only a few studies found evidence for increased NAcc (or ventral striatal) activity (  k  \u202f=\u202f3 studies), whereas others reported decreased NAcc activity (  k  \u202f=\u202f2 studies), and the rest reported no significant differences (  k  \u202f=\u202f10 studies) in NAcc activity of bipolar versus control participants.   \nCharacteristics of FMRI studies investigating neural responses to incentives in adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder versus healthy control participants. \n  Table 1:   \n\nThese findings might vary for a number of reasons. Study design might play a role, since studies reporting increased NAcc activity during reward in individuals with bipolar disorder tended to use card guessing or roulette tasks ( ;  ;  ), whereas studies reporting decreased NAcc activity tended to use Monetary Incentive Delay (or MID) tasks ( ;  ). Other methodological reasons for variation might include smaller sample sizes (e.g., fewer than 20 per group ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  )), insufficiently large incentives to increase NAcc activity in healthy controls ( ), or the lack of neutral or loss conditions for comparison ( ). Thus, while some FMRI evidence implies abnormalities in the neural processing of incentives in bipolar disorder, the direction and strength of these effects remains unclear. \n\nDifferences in psychological states might also account for variability in diagnostic group differences across studies. Variation across samples in mood state, comorbid diagnoses, and medication profiles might make complicate comparisons. For instance, reward-related activity was reported to normalize in one small bipolar sample after remission ( ), and depressive symptoms might blunt NAcc activity during reward anticipation in nonbipolar ( ) as well as bipolar samples ( ;  ;  ), while hypomanic symptoms might intensify responses to reward outcomes ( ). Further, some evidence suggests that antipsychotic medications (which are sometimes prescribed to treat bipolar disorder) might generally blunt neural responses to reward anticipation and outcomes ( ;  ). \n\nFurther, individual differences in psychological traits might also increase the variability of these findings. In this study, we specifically focus on a dimensional trait which has gained considerable support as an important correlate of bipolar disorder \u2013\u2013 the Positive Urgency Measure (PUM), which assesses a trait-like tendency to respond impulsively to positive emotional states. Several studies have reported increased PUM scores in individuals who are diagnosed with remitted bipolar I disorder as well as in those with mild subsyndromal manic symptoms ( ;  ). Moreover, after accounting for clinical, treatment, and personality characteristics in individuals diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, individual differences in PUM were robustly associated with a host of difficulties including aggression ( ), self-harm, suicidal ideation and behavior ( ), functional impairment, and poor quality of life ( ;  ). PUM scores were also significantly more elevated in individuals with remitted bipolar disorder than other measures of impulsivity ( ). Because PUM indexes impulsive responses to positive emotions, this construct may prove particularly relevant for understanding neural responses to reward. To our knowledge, no study has yet examined neural correlates of PUM in individuals with bipolar disorder (but see   and   for neuroimaging studies of PUM in alcoholism with nonincentivized tasks, as well as   for a neuroimaging study of a mixed clinical group with an incentivized gambling task). \n\nGiven mixed FMRI evidence for abnormal neural responses to reward in bipolar disorder, we sought to directly compare neural activity during anticipation of monetary incentives and in response to their outcomes in a group of individuals diagnosed with bipolar (I) disorder versus an age- and gender-matched non-mood disordered control group. We also examined whether individual differences in Positive Urgency (PUM) might help to explain further variability within the bipolar disordered group. Our analyses could account for potentially confounding effects of antipsychotic medications ( ), illness severity ( ), comorbid conditions including substance-related disorders ( ), anxiety disorders ( ), and subsyndromal depressive and manic symptoms). To control for these potential confounds, we stratified recruitment based on lifetime anxiety and substance abuse disorders and oversampled individuals who were free of medications. We also excluded individuals who were taking first-generation antipsychotic medications, which might blunt NAcc activity during reward anticipation ( ). To probe neural responses to monetary incentives, individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder and healthy control participants completed a MID Task while undergoing scanning with FMRI. We specifically tested whether participants diagnosed with bipolar disorder would show altered NAcc activity during gain anticipation, and also whether individual differences in PUM could account for group differences in neural responses to reward. Since previous studies of bipolar disorder have reported neural responses to gain and loss in other regions implicated in incentive processing, we additionally considered activity in those regions (i.e., the MPFC as well as the Anterior Insula or AIns). \n\n## Method \n  \nParticipants were recruited through community and internet advertisements, as well as local clinics. Individuals who contacted the study team were pre-screened by telephone for demographic medical exclusion criteria and likely diagnosis. Potential participants were scheduled for individual in-person appointments. Written informed consent was obtained from participants upon arriving at the university. Potential participants completed a comprehensive interview to assess diagnostic status and inclusion/exclusion criteria, and completed other measures not relevant for the current report ( ;  ). FMRI scans were conducted during separate testing sessions to limit participant fatigue. Medication assessments were conducted prior to FMRI scans. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Stanford University Medical School, and data collection occurred between April of 2007 and July of 2009. \n\n### Participants \n  \nThe current study included 24 participants with bipolar I disorder (the \u201cbipolar group\u201d; 14 men, mean age\u202f=\u202f36.22, 11 minorities) and 24 participants with no lifetime history of mood disorder (the \u201ccontrol group\u201d; 13 men, mean age\u202f=\u202f33.92, 9 minorities;  ), such that a total of 48 individuals were included in the final analysis. To be eligible for the study, individuals had to be between the ages of 18 and 60 years, be fluent English speakers, and meet criteria for Bipolar I Disorder (BD I) or for no lifetime mood disorder using the Structured Clinical Interview for the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (SCID-IV) ( ). Exclusion criteria included a history of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence in the past year, primary psychotic disorders, history of brain injury, hemorrhage, or tumor, stroke, medical conditions influencing the central nervous system, developmental disabilities, electroconvulsive treatment within the past 18 months, weight greater than 300 pounds, pain medication during the 24\u00a0h before the scan, diabetes, epilepsy, cardiovascular disorder, loss of consciousness for more than 5\u00a0min in the past year or more than 1\u00a0h during lifetime, and history of amnesia. To ensure adequate ability to complete the computerized cognitive tasks, individuals were excluded if they were color blind or dyslexic. To ensure safety and comfort, individuals were excluded if they reported claustrophobia or any occupational or medical history entailing a risk of a metallic object in their body that could be dislodged by scanning (e.g., work as a metal worker, eye injury involving a metallic object, nonremovable body piercings, metal implants or ear tubes, certain tattoos). Women with late menstrual periods or possible pregnancies were also excluded, as were individuals taking first-generation antipsychotic medications.   \nDemographic, clinical, and behavioral responses by group. \n  Table 2:     \n\nTo increase generalizability, individuals who were symptomatic at the time of the diagnostic interview were not excluded from participation. Rather, we conducted monthly telephone symptom severity assessments and proceeded with the fMRI session after they had achieved remission criteria based on symptom scale scores (described below). To verify sustained remission, participants completed symptom severity measures 24\u00a0h before the FMRI session. Prior to analysis, we excluded 10 participants (5 control; 5 bipolar) with excessive motion (i.e., > 2\u00a0mm in any dimension from one scan to the next), leading to analysis of data from 48 of the 58 individuals who completed the entire protocol. \n\nBipolar and control groups were matched with respect to age, gender, employment status, race, ethnicity, handedness, lifetime diagnoses of substance-related abuse and dependence, and lifetime diagnoses of anxiety disorders. Power analysis indicated that samples of at least 23 participants per group would be required to detect large group differences in NAcc activity during gain versus nongain anticipation (  d  \u202f=\u202f0.75) at a power of 0.80 and an error probability (directional) of 0.05 (using G*Power software, version 3.1). \n\n\n### Measures \n  \nDiagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder and comorbid conditions were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV) for Axis I disorders. Before administering SCID-IV interviews, interviewers completed extensive didactic and role-play training and achieved inter-rater reliability of 1.0 for both depression and mania diagnoses for 10 randomly selected interviews, as assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient. \n\nAs an interviewer-rated measure of current manic symptoms (including elevated mood, self-esteem, motor activity, verbal activity, sleep, hostility, and sexual interest), we used the Bech Rafaelsen Mania Scale (BRMS); 11-items). Our version also included suggested probes as well as anchor points. This scale has been sensitive to changes with treatment, and correlates with diagnosis as well as other measures of mania symptom severity ( ). We used standardized probes to achieve high inter-rater reliability (intraclass correlation\u202f=\u202f0.93 in a sample of 14 randomly selected audiotapes) and internal consistency (alpha\u202f=\u202f0.94). \n\nAs an interview-based measure of depressive symptom severity, we used the Modified Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (MHRSD; 17 items;  ). While scores on the modified scale correlate robustly with the original Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the scale was revised to include standardized probes and behavioral anchors for rating each item. The MHRSD scale shows strong psychometric qualities, including inter-rater reliability, concordance with other depression measures, and sensitivity to change with treatment ( ). Our coders achieved robust inter-rater reliability for a set of 14 randomly-selected audiotaped interviews (alpha\u202f=\u202f0.92). Participants were scheduled for FMRI sessions if their BRMS and MHRSD scores were both less than or equal to a score of seven, indicating remission. \n\nThe Positive Urgency Measure (PUM) was designed to capture tendencies to act impulsively in response to positive emotion (e.g. \u201cOthers would say I make bad choices when I am extremely happy about something\u201d) ( ). The scale includes 14 items that are self-rated on a scale ranging from 1 (agree strongly) to 4 (disagree strongly). The PUM has shown factor analytic support, strong internal consistency, and correspondence with interviewer and family ratings ( ;  ). High scores have been associated with risky behavior, externalizing syndromes ( ), depression diagnoses ( ), and bipolar diagnosis ( ). High scores have also been associated with poor function and quality of life ( ;  ) and with aggression and suicidality ( ;  ) in individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In the current sample, the scale showed high internal consistency (\u03b1=0.97). \n\nPharmacotherapy was assessed by interview. While more than one patient was taking lithium, valproic acid, lamotrigine, benzodiazepines, antidepressants or second-generation antipsychotics, no patient was taking carbamazepine or gabapentin. Because dose distributions were positively skewed, measures of drugs taken were converted from dosages to presence versus absence indices for analysis. Exploratory analyses revealed that of the reported medications, only treatment with second-generation antipsychotics was related to the primary outcome variable (i.e., the linear coefficient of gain anticipation activity in the NAcc; Wilcoxon rank sum   W  \u202f=\u202f\u221221,   n  \u202f=\u202f6,   m  \u202f=\u202f18,   p  =.024). Therefore, parallel analyses excluding participants on atypical antipsychotic medications were conducted to verify robustness of the critically predicted findings. \n\n\n### Task \n  \nParticipants completed a version of the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) Task designed to elicit neural and behavioral responses to monetary incentives and their outcomes during FMRI scan acquisition ( ). Each trial (8000\u00a0ms total) began with presentation of a visual cue (cue period; 2000\u00a0ms). Cue shapes indicated the valence (gain: circle, or loss: square) and horizontal lines across the cues indicated magnitude ($0.00: no lines, $0.20: one line, $1.00: two lines, or $5.00: three lines) of incentives that participants could try to gain or avoid losing by responding to an upcoming target. In addition to gain and loss trials, triangle cues indicated nonresponse trials, in which participants were instructed to not respond to upcoming targets. This version of the MID task therefore included 9 total conditions (4 gain, 4 loss, and 1 nonresponse). After viewing the cue, participants were shown a fixation cross for a variable interval (anticipation period; 2000 \u2013 2500\u00a0ms), followed by a target that briefly appeared (150 \u2013 470\u00a0ms). Participants were instructed to try to press a button before the disappearance of each target to either gain or avoid losing the previously cued amount of money. After a second variable delay (1030 \u2013 2350\u00a0ms), participants received feedback informing them of the amount they had gained or lost on each trial (outcome period; 2000\u00a0ms). Participants completed two blocks including 90 trials each (20 trials per condition; 180 trials total). Trials were presented in a pseudo-random sequence within each block. An adaptive timing algorithm applied to the targets maintained an approximately constant hit rate within each condition (i.e., if an individual's hit rate for a condition did not approximate an average of 66%, the duration of the next target was shortened or lengthened). \n\nBefore scanning, participants were taught how to play the task (including the meaning of each cue), and then played a training version of the task until they understood the incentives and task demands (typically lasting less than 10\u00a0min). Participants were then allowed to ask questions, shown the cash they could win, and explicitly quizzed about the meaning of a subset of the cues they had seen. After completing the task, participants rated levels of arousal and valence they experienced in response to the presentation of each cue during the MID task. Ratings were made on 7-point Likert scales for each cue in which the arousal scale ranged from not aroused to very aroused and the valence scale ranged from negative through neutral to positive. These scores were then mean-deviated within subject and rotated 45\u00b0 through two-dimensional space to derive independent measures of positive arousal and negative arousal for each cue prior to analyses ( ). These rotated \u201canticipatory affective\u201d dimensions of positive arousal and negative arousal align most closely with NAcc and AIns activity, respectively, in previous research ( ). Participants received cash payments for their task earnings after rating the cues. \n\n\n### FMRI acquisition and analysis \n  \nParticipants were scanned with a General Electric 1.5 T Signa scanner using a standard birdcage quadrature head coil. Stimuli were presented using E-Prime 1.1 software and projected onto a mirror mounted on the coil. Participants were fitted with a bite bar and padding to minimize head motion. Functional images covered the whole brain and consisted of 24 contiguous 4-mm thick axial slices (TR: 2000\u00a0ms, TE: 40\u00a0ms, flip: 90\u00b0, 3.44\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.44\u00a0mm in-plane resolution, 64\u202f\u00d7\u202f64 matrix), collected using a T2*-sensitive spiral in/out pulse sequence that minimizes dropout in ventral frontal and medial temporal regions of interest ( ;  ). \n\nWe first examined behavior (hit rate, hit reaction time) and affect ratings (positive arousal and negative arousal ratings in response to incentive cues), to verify that diagnostic groups did not differ significantly. To do so, we conducted four parallel, mixed-model Analyses Of Variance (ANOVAs) to assess the effects of diagnostic group (bipolar vs. control) as a between-subjects factor, valence (gain vs. loss) and amount of money ($0.00, $0.20, $1.00, $5.00) as within-subjects factors, and the interaction of these two factors. \n\nAnalyses of brain activity then included three stages: (1) whole brain localization to confirm significant responses in predicted regions; (2) targeted group comparisons to test for the predicted differences in Volumes Of Interest (VOIs); and (3) regressions to examine whether individual differences correlated with activity in VOIs. These analyses were conducted using Analysis of Functional NeuroImaging (AFNI version AFNI_18.0.25,  ). For preprocessing, each voxel's time series was concatenated across runs and corrected for differences in the timing of slice acquisition using sync-interpolation. Head motion was estimated and corrected in three dimensions and three rotations. We visually examined motion estimates to ensure that no participant's head movement exceeded 2.0\u00a0mm in any direction from one volume to the next. Data was then spatially smoothed using a 4\u00a0mm full-width-at-half-maximum Gaussian blurring kernel ( ), high-pass filtered, and normalized to percent signal change using each voxel's average activation across the entire task as a baseline. \n\nFor whole-brain analysis, we used a multiple regression model that included four orthogonal parametric regressors of interest: (1) gain anticipation (linearly weighted as ++0.00 / \u22123, ++0.20 / \u22121, ++1.00 / 1, ++5.00 / 3); (2) loss anticipation (linearly weighted as \u2212$0.00 / \u22123, \u2212$0.20 / \u22121, \u2212$1.00 / 1, \u2212$5.00 / 3); (3) gain versus nongain outcomes (hit vs. miss weighted as ++1.00 / \u00b11, ++5.00 / \u00b13); (4) and non-loss versus loss outcomes (hit vs. miss weighted as \u2212$1.00 / \u00b11, \u2212$5.00 / \u00b13). Covariates of noninterest included two regressors weighting each modeled trial period (anticipation period and outcome period), six regressors indexing motion (3 dimensions of linear and rotated displacement), and two regressors indexing white-matter and cerebrospinal-fluid intensity ( ). All regressors of interest were convolved with a gamma-variate function that modeled a canonical hemodynamic response function ( ). The model output maps of t-statistics were transformed into maps of Z-scores, resampled at 3.75\u00a0mm  (to approximate the originally-acquired voxel size and resolution), and coregistered with the structural scan. Whole brain statistical maps were estimated using a grey matter mask and cluster-thresholded (cluster size \u2265 3 contiguous 3.75\u00a0mm cubic voxels) to yield corrected maps (  p   < .05 corrected,   p   < .0001 uncorrected, derived with 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations using 3dClustSim in AFNI version 18.0.25, which estimates spatial autocorrelation by default to minimize false positive results). \n\nNeural activity in predicted volumes of interest (VOIs) during incentive anticipation was then compared between groups. To extract raw activity time courses for targeted analyses, spherical VOIs (8\u00a0mm diameter) were centered on bilateral foci for the NAcc (Talairach coordinates: \u00b110, 12, \u20132), AIns (\u00b134, 24, \u20134), and MPFC (\u00b14, 45, 0), based on coordinates identified in previous meta-analytic reviews of neuroimaging research on incentive processing ( ). To directly test for group differences in NAcc activity during gain anticipation, we analyzed peak activity (i.e., at a 4\u00a0s lag) extracted from bilateral NAcc volumes of interest (foci: \u00b110, 10, \u20132) during incentive anticipation. To test the regional specificity of effects observed in the NAcc, parallel analyses were conducted on bilateral AIns and MPFC activity during anticipation of incentives. Activity from these VOIs was submitted to mixed model group (control versus bipolar; between) x valence (gain, loss; within) x magnitude ($0.00, $0.20, $1.00, $5.00; within) ANOVAs for anticipatory activity. Post-hoc group comparisons involved t-tests thresholded by a Bonferroni correction for multiple tests (i.e.,   p  <.05 / 8 conditions\u202f=\u202f0.00625). \n\nTo verify that activity in predicted VOIs could classify groups even in a model-free context, we applied classification models (i.e., Support Vector Machine with Recursive Feature Elimination or SVM-RFE) to whole brain coefficient maps of the linear gain anticipation contrast ( ) using scikit-learn ( ). We initially applied the SVM classifier using Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation (LOSO CV) to determine which hyperparameter (i.e., C-value) could best classify bipolar versus control participants. Next, we ran the SVM classifier using the optimal hyperparameter value and Leave-One-Subject-Out CrossValidation (LOSO CV) for several iterations, recursively eliminating the lowest 5% of features at each step until the top 0.1% of discriminating features remained. Finally, we back-projected the remaining features into normalized brain space (i.e., Talairach space) to visualize the location of features that most robustly discriminated bipolar versus control participants. \n\nTo construct models of individual differences, we first conducted bivariate correlation analyses to explore whether relevant activity in the predefined volume of interest (i.e., NAcc activity during gain anticipation) was associated with potentially confounding effects of demographic, clinical, or medication variables. Next, we conducted logistic regression analyses to examine the ability of individual differences in Positive Urgency (PUM), anticipatory brain activity (e.g., linear NAcc gain anticipation coefficient; linear AIns loss anticipation coefficient; linear MPFC gain outcome coefficient), and their combination to distinguish individuals with bipolar disorder from controls. Bootstrapped accelerated mediation models (  n  \u202f=\u202f1000 draws) then tested whether individual differences in PUM could account for associations of NAcc activity during gain anticipation with bipolar versus control diagnostic status using the \u201clavaan\u201d package in R ( ). Finally, to verify the importance of NAcc activity during gain anticipation, whole brain linear gain anticipation coefficients were regressed against individual differences in PUM across both bipolar and control participants. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Participant characteristics \n  \nAlthough the bipolar group reported significantly higher mania (BRMS) and depression (MHRSD) symptoms than the control group, both groups\u2019 scores fell within the remitted range. Participants diagnosed with bipolar disorder had an average of approximately 9 previous manic episodes and approximately 11 previous depressed episodes ( ). \n\n\n### Behavior and affect \n  \nGroups did not significantly differ in hit rates (overall range: 0.61\u2013.71), consistent with the hit rate targeted by the adaptive timing algorithm (i.e., 66%). For hit rate, a mixed-model ANOVA of diagnostic group, valence, magnitude, and the interaction of these effects yielded no main effect of incentive valence and a main effect of magnitude (  F  (3,138)=5.25,   p  =.002), but groups did not significantly differ. Similarly, there were main effects of incentive valence (F(1,46)=7.01,   p  =.011) and magnitude (  F  (3,138)\u202f=\u202f20.27,   p  <.001) on hit reaction time; but no group differences. Thus, diagnostic groups did not significantly differ in their behavioral performance on the MID task, and the effects of task conditions on behavior replicated patterns reported in previous research ( ). \n\nWith respect to cue-induced affect ratings, two mixed-model ANOVAs assessed effects of diagnostic group, valence, and magnitude on positive arousal and negative arousal ratings. Two participants (1 bipolar and 1 control) did not provide affective ratings and so were omitted from this analysis. For positive arousal, the analysis yielded the predicted main effects of valence (  F  (1,43)=90.09,   p  <.001, \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.682) and magnitude (  F  (3,129)=51.95,   p  <.001, \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.553), which were qualified by an interaction of valence and magnitude (  F  (3,129)=28.92,   p  <.001; \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.408; see  ). There was no significant main effect of diagnostic group or interaction on positive arousal ratings. For negative arousal, a similar analysis yielded the predicted main effects of valence (  F  (1,43)=42.26,   p  <.001, \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.507) and magnitude (  F  (3,129)=40.18,   p  <.001, \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.489), which were qualified by an interaction of valence and magnitude (  F  (3,129)=25.72,   p  <.001, \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.380). As with positive arousal ratings, there was no significant main effect of diagnostic group or interaction on negative arousal ratings. Thus, while MID task cues induced self-reported affect, diagnostic groups did not significantly differ in their responses ( ).   \nCue-induced affect and behavioral performance by group and condition. \n  Table 3:     \n\n\n### Brain activity \n  \n#### Whole brain analyses \n  \nAcross both groups, gain anticipation and loss anticipation contrasts significantly correlated with increased activity in dopamine mesolimbic target projection regions including the striatum (specifically, the NAcc), the AIns, and other regions, while the gain outcome contrast correlated with activity in MFPC regions, consistent with previous findings (Tables S1 and S2). Direct group comparisons of these contrasts of interest revealed that the bipolar group showed less activity for the gain anticipation contrast specifically in the ventral striatum (including the right NAcc and right globus pallidus), as well as less activity for the gain outcome contrast in the left occipital gyrus, relative to the control group. Groups did not significantly differ, however, in their neural responses either to loss anticipation or to loss outcomes ( ;  ).   \nBipolar, control, and bipolar versus control contrast for gain anticipation linear contrast (  A  =Anterior,   R  =Right;   p  <.001 uncorrected for display, with each color gradation representing an order of magnitude increase in significance). \n  Fig. 1     \nComparison of bipolar (  n  \u202f=\u202f24) versus control groups (  n  \u202f=\u202f24;   p  <.0001 uncorrected,   p  <.05 corrected, cluster \u2265 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.75\u202fmm  voxels; positive Z-score indicates bipolar > control;   x  =right,   y  =anterior;   z  =superior). \n  Table 4   \n\n\n#### Volume of interest (VOI) analyses \n  \nFor NAcc VOI activity during incentive anticipation, a mixed-model ANOVA of diagnostic group, valence, and magnitude yielded the predicted main effects of magnitude (  F  (3,138)\u202f=\u202f43.12,   p   < .001, \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.537) and valence (  F  (1,46)\u202f=\u202f66.29,   p   < .001, \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.313), which were qualified by a predicted interaction of magnitude and valence (  F  (3,138)\u202f=\u202f19.96,   p   < .001, \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.303). This analysis also yielded a significant main effect of group (  F  (1, 46)\u202f=\u202f6.110,   p  \u202f=\u202f.017, \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.198), which was qualified by a significant interaction of magnitude by group (  F  (3,138)\u202f=\u202f4.779,   p  \u202f=\u202f.003, \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.114). Posthoc comparisons revealed that bipolar versus control groups significantly differed with respect to NAcc activity during anticipation of high gains (  t  (46)=\u22123.18,   p  =.003;   d  \u202f=\u202f0.92) and medium gains (  t  (46)=\u22123.24,   p  =.002;   d  \u202f=\u202f0.93), but not in any other condition (  p  <.05 Bonferroni corrected for 8 comparisons at 0.006; see  ).   \nNucleus Accumbens volume of interest peak activity by condition for bipolar versus control groups. (**  p   < .005 uncorrected,   p   < .05 corrected for 6 comparisons). \n  Fig. 2   \n\nThis pattern of significance persisted in an identical analysis after removing the 6 participants on atypical antipsychotics. Specifically, for NAcc activity during incentive anticipation, a mixed-model ANOVA of diagnostic group, valence, and magnitude yielded the predicted main effects of magnitude (  F  (3,120)\u202f=\u202f48.37,   p   < .001, \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.585) and valence (  F  (1,40)\u202f=\u202f61.99,   p   < .001, \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.330), which were qualified by a predicted interaction of magnitude and valence (  F  (3,120)\u202f=\u202f20.62,   p   < .001, \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.340). This analysis also yielded a significant main effect of group (  F  (1, 40)\u202f=\u202f6.84,   p  \u202f=\u202f.012, \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.165), which was qualified by a significant interaction of magnitude by group (  F  (3,120)\u202f=\u202f3.87,   p  \u202f=\u202f.011, \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.101). \n\nBy comparison, analysis of bilateral AIns activity during anticipation of incentives yielded a significant main effect only of magnitude (  F  (3,138)\u202f=\u202f23.94,   p  <.001; \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.428), which was qualified by unpredicted interactions of valence and magnitude (  F  (3,138)\u202f=\u202f7.07,   p  <.001; \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.133) and valence and group (  F  (1,46)\u202f=\u202f6.62   p  =.013; \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.057). Posthoc comparisons, however, indicated significant differences between diagnostic groups with respect to AIns activity only during anticipation of high gains (  t  (46)\u202f=\u202f\u22122.93,   p  =.005;   d  \u202f=\u202f0.81), but not in any other condition (  p  <.05 Bonferroni corrected for 8 comparisons at 0.006). Analysis of MPFC activity during incentive anticipation yielded significant main effects of valence (  F  (3,46)\u202f=\u202f13.60,   p  <.001; \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.083) and magnitude (  F  (3,138)\u202f=\u202f23.32,   p  <.001; \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.444), which were qualified by a significant interaction of valence and magnitude (  F  (3,138)\u202f=\u202f4.17,   p  =.007; \u03b7 \u202f=\u202f0.083), but no main effects or interactions with group. Posthoc comparisons also indicated no significant differences between diagnostic groups in any condition with respect to MPFC activity. \n\nTo validate the focus on the diagnostic properties of NAcc activity, a classifier (SVM-RFE) was applied to whole brain data for the coefficients of the gain anticipation contrast to distinguish groups. After recursive elimination of 99.9% of the features, leave-one-subject-out cross-validated accuracy at a c-value of 10 yielded a classification rate of 60%. Projecting this remaining 0.1% of the selected features back into standardized (i.e., Talairach) brain space revealed negative features in the ventral striatum, which overlapped with the predefined NAcc VOI (see Figure S1). \n\n\n\n### Associations of neural activity with individual differences \n  \nTo explore whether predicted brain activity was associated with potential demographic and clinical confounds, we examined the association of the NAcc gain anticipation contrast with age, gender, current manic symptoms (BRMS), current depressive symptoms (MHRSD), number of lifetime hospitalizations for depression and mania, lifetime diagnoses of anxiety disorders, lifetime diagnoses of problems with substance or alcohol use, and presence of concurrent medications (separately examined for lithium, valproate, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepenes, and lamictal). Only the presence versus absence of atypical antipsychotic medications was associated with decreased NAcc gain anticipation activity in bipolar participants (t(22)= \u20132.30,   p  =.031). \n\nNext, we conducted logistic regression analyses to examine whether individual differences in the Positive Urgency Measure (PUM), NAcc gain anticipation activity, and their combination could distinguish the bipolar group from the control group. Leave-one-subject-out classifiers indicated that PUM classified diagnosis at 83%, NAcc gain anticipation coefficients classified diagnosis at 77%, and their combination classified diagnosis at 80%. Thus, PUM symptoms alone best differentiated participants with bipolar disorder from controls. Similar results were obtained after removing the 6 individuals on atypical antipsychotics from analysis. Specifically, leave-one-subject-out classifiers indicated that PUM classified diagnosis at 80%, NAcc gain anticipation coefficients classified diagnosis at 67%, and their combination classified diagnosis at 80%. \n\nFinally, we conducted bootstrapped accelerated mediation analyses to test whether individual differences in PUM could statistically account for the association of NAcc gain anticipation activity with bipolar diagnosis. The direct path of NAcc gain anticipation to bipolar diagnosis was significant (  Z  =\u22123.41;   p  =.000), as were the indirect paths from NAcc gain anticipation to PUM (  Z  =\u22122.68;   p  =.007) and from PUM to bipolar diagnosis (  Z  \u202f=\u202f5.61;   p  =.000). Including these indirect paths statistically mediated the influence of the direct path (  Z  =\u22121.76,   p  =.079), suggesting that individual differences in PUM could account for the association of NAcc gain anticipation with bipolar diagnosis. An alternative specification of this mediation model in which NAcc gain anticipation and PUM were switched did not fit the data as well (i.e., total model fit of   Z  \u202f=\u202f3.50,   p  =.000 versus   Z  \u202f=\u202f6.43,   p  =.000). \n\nIdentical mediation analyses that substituted manic (BRMS) or depressive (HRSD) symptoms (which also differed by group) for positive urgency (PUM) were not significant. Thus, the best-fitting model suggested that individual differences in PUM could statistically account for the observed association of NAcc gain anticipation activity with bipolar diagnosis ( ). Identical mediation analyses further indicated that individual differences in PUM could statistically account for the association of NAcc gain anticipation activity with bipolar diagnosis, even after excluding participants on atypical antipsychotics. The direct path of NAcc gain anticipation to bipolar diagnosis was significant (  Z  =\u22122.31;   p  =.021), as were the indirect paths from NAcc gain anticipation to PUM (  Z  =\u22121.84;   p  =.066) and from PUM to bipolar diagnosis (  Z  \u202f=\u202f5.72;   p  =.000). Including the indirect path statistically mediated the influence of the direct path (  Z  =\u22121.39,   p  =.163), again suggesting that individual differences in PUM could account for the association of NAcc gain anticipation with bipolar diagnosis, even after excluding individuals on atypical antipsychotics.   \nStatistical mediation of association of Nucleus Accumbens activity with bipolar versus control group status by individual differences in positive urgency (Z-scores;   n  \u202f=\u202f48; **  p  <.01, ***  p  <.001). \n  Fig. 3   \n\nFinally, supplementary whole-brain analyses confirmed this study's focus on NAcc activity during gain anticipation, since an exploratory regression of the gain anticipation contrast against individual differences in PUM across both groups revealed peak associations in the NAcc (Table S3). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe goal of this study was to examine neural responses to monetary incentives in individuals diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Although extensive behavioral research has implicated altered reward processing in Bipolar Disorder, neuroimaging findings have proven less consistent. For instance, investigators have reported increases, decreases, and no significant difference in ventral striatal activity of bipolar versus control participants during reward anticipation (see  ). In the present study \u2013 somewhat surprisingly \u2013 participants with bipolar disorder showed reduced rather than increased activity in the ventral striatum (including the NAcc) during anticipation of monetary gains relative to controls. Bipolar and control participants did not significantly differ in their neural responses during anticipation of losses or in response to incentive outcomes. Blunted NAcc activity was also more pronounced in individuals who reported more impulsive responses to positive emotion (PUM) \u2013 which could statistically account for the association of blunted NAcc activity during reward anticipation with bipolar diagnosis. Analyses of other conditions revealed few other diagnostic group differences, suggesting a relatively specific distinction between diagnostic groups with respect to blunted ventral striatal activity during gain anticipation. \n\nThis study is novel in its integration of bipolar diagnostic status with individual differences in Positive Urgency (PUM). The findings associate for the first time a behavioral measure of PUM, which indexes a tendency to engage in regrettable behavior during positive emotion states, with neural anomalies in reward processing. Beyond a diagnostic association with remitted bipolar disorder, PUM scores have been associated with lower behavioral functioning, decreased quality of life, and more severe outcomes (such as suicidality and aggression). The current findings imply that in individuals with bipolar disorder, individual differences in PUM may also help account for blunted NAcc activity during reward anticipation. Thus, these findings might help to elucidate a physiological basis for the behavioral correlates of PUM. The emphasis on individual differences in symptom profiles is also consistent with recent efforts (e.g., by the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria or RDoC initiative) to characterize biopsychological dimensions that underlie psychiatric disorders ( ). A future goal in might involve extending these probes to other disorders involving blunted neural responses to conventional rewards and impulsive behavior, such as addictions ( ;  ). \n\nBeyond positive urgency, other individual difference variables might also help to explain inconsistent findings across studies of bipolar disorder. Although individuals taking first-generation antipsychotics were excluded from this study, those taking second-generation antipsychotics showed modestly diminished neural responses during gain anticipation. Thus, medications that influence dopamine function may modulate neuroimaging signals related to reward ( ). These medication effects are not likely to explain all of the reward-related abnormalities observed in this study, however, since other researchers have documented blunted dorsal striatal activity during gain anticipation even in medication-na\u00efve bipolar patients ( ). Further, even after excluding individuals taking second-generation antipsychotics in supplemental analyses in the current study, blunted neural responses during gain anticipation were still evident in the bipolar group. \n\nThe current study features some strengths relative to previous studies of neural responses to gain anticipation in bipolar disorder, including an adequately-powered sample size, stratification based on anxiety and substance abuse diagnoses, a control group that was matched on anxiety and substance abuse disorders, exclusion of individuals who were taking first-generation neuroleptic medications, longitudinal assessment to ensure remission of bipolar symptoms, and specific analyses of individual differences in neural responsiveness to incentives. Groups were also well-matched in their ability to learn and perform the Monetary Incentive Delay task, which featured parametric manipulation of the magnitude of both gains and losses. Although different subgroups within a clinical sample might show distinct behavioral and neural profiles even while performing the same task ( ), statistical comparisons revealed no evidence of increased variability in the behavioral or neural responses of the bipolar versus control groups in this study ( ). \n\nThe study also has some limitations. First, while adequately powered to detect group differences in neural responses to incentives, this study was not designed to detect small effects or interactions in the variables of interest. Second, some selection criteria (e.g., absence of claustrophobia or cardiovascular conditions) might covary with a bipolar diagnosis. For example, as many as half of participants with a bipolar I disorder diagnosis typically meet criteria for simple phobias (such as claustrophobia;  ), and bipolar disorder has been related to a two-fold increase in risk of cardiovascular disease relative to the general population ( ). Finally, the sample recruited for this study was not structured to assess whether neural responses to incentives might fluctuate with episode status, which could provide additional information for understanding dynamic processes underlying bipolar disorder ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nDespite these limitations, analyses revealed a clear directional bias in neural responses to anticipated monetary gain in bipolar disorder. Consistent with some, but not all, previous findings ( ;  ;  ), both volume of interest and whole-brain analyses indicated that relative to controls, individuals with bipolar disorder showed blunted NAcc activity during gain anticipation. These results might seem surprising, given that reviews of the literature have reached opposite conclusions ( ;  ). Nonetheless, our initial qualitative review of existing findings suggests that striatal blunting was consistent with more recent findings using the MID task ( ), and which included studies of unmedicated individuals diagnosed with milder forms of bipolar disorder ( ). Blunted ventral striatal responses during gain anticipation have been observed in other psychiatric conditions characterized by abnormal reward processing including externalizing syndromes in adolescents ( ), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ;  ), stimulant use ( ), and alcohol abuse ( ). In the present study, the effect sizes of blunted NAcc activity during reward anticipation in the bipolar versus control group (d's\u223c.90;  ) were comparable to effect sizes identified in meta-analyses of similar neuroimaging studies of schizophrenia (d's\u223c.70;  ), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (d's\u223c.50;  ), and substance use disorder (d's\u223c.20;  ;  ). Blunted NAcc activity during reward anticipation might also play a role in anhedonic symptoms related to unipolar depression ( ;  ), but it is not clear whether this blunted activity occurs during reward anticipation or in response to reward outcomes ( ;  ) and sufficient research has not yet accumulated to support quantitative meta-analysis. Blunted neural anticipation of reward might provoke attempts to compensate with increased reward-seeking behavior ( ), which could manifest as individual differences in the tendency to respond impulsively to positive emotional states (as indexed by the PUM), and may foreshadow future problems involving impulsive behavior (e.g., problematic drug use in adolescents, ( )). \n\nTogether, these findings suggest that individuals with remitted bipolar disorder show blunted ventral striatal responses during anticipation of conventional rewards (e.g., money). In future research, methodological details related to task type and timing (e.g., incentive anticipation versus outcome) may moderate the sensitivity of neural probes. For instance, the existing literature suggests that in individuals with bipolar disorder, ventral striatal activity is blunted in studies that use the MID task, but possibly potentiated in studies using card-guessing tasks (though fewer of these studies exist; see  ). Thus, distinguishing and comparing neural responses to gain anticipation and outcomes might enhance the consistency and generality of findings. Future clinical applications might also involve correlating neural responses to incentives with externally valid behaviors and symptom profiles. By better delineating conceptual extensions and methodological boundaries, neuroimaging findings may yield the most informative and reliable markers of psychiatric symptoms that underlie bipolar disorder  .  \n\n\n## Archive \n  \nScripts and data relevant to this manuscript can be found at osf.io, and whole brain unthresholded statistical maps are available at neurovault.org. \n\n\n## Financial disclosures \n  \nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6831914, "text_md5": "17ef2930e58766bab88d19b12362d4ea", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 97], "journal": [98, 113], "publication_year": [115, 119], "title": [130, 189], "keywords": [203, 264], "abstract": [277, 1998], "body": [2007, 51157]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 31670069, "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2019.102018", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6831914", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6831914"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6831914\">6831914</a>", "list_title": "PMC6831914  Neural responses to monetary incentives in bipolar disorder"}

Here we report a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment to examine the involvement of TPJ for second-order inferences. Participants played an economic game with three types of opponents: a human opponent outside the scanner, an artificial agent that followed a fixed probabilistic strategy according to a game-theoretic solution (FIX) and an artificial agent that adjusted its choices through a machine-learning algorithm (LRN). Participants\u2019 choice behaviors against the human opponent and LRN were similar but remarkably different from those against FIX. The activation of the left TPJ (LTPJ) was correlated with choice behavior against the human opponent and LRN but not against FIX. The overall activity pattern of the LTPJ for the human opponent was also similar to that for LRN but not for FIX. In contrast, the right TPJ (RTPJ) showed higher activation for the human opponent than FIX and LRN. These results suggest that, while the RTPJ is associated with the perception of human agency, the LTPJ is involved in second-order inferences in strategic decision making. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCompetitive situations in which one\u2019s own benefit means the opponent\u2019s loss (and vice versa) are common in many facets of our social lives, including resource allocation, rivalry for social status, games such as football or chess, public debate and so on. When such competitive situations are repeated, we must not only learn and predict the opponent\u2019s behavior but also simultaneously be aware that the opponent also learns and predicts our behavior. This bilateral (\u2018higher-order\u2019) inference about the opponent\u2019s state of mind is a major ingredient in human strategic interactions. \n\nA rational solution to such a competitive game is a mixed strategy that assigns a choice probability to each of the options according to the Nash equilibrium ( ). However, it is known that humans often deviate from the equilibrium ( ; see also  ). Rather than adopting the theoretically derived, fixed Nash strategy, people often seem motivated to explore the choice probabilities of the opponent for possible exploitation ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, such attempts at exploitation must take into account how our own choices may influence the opponent\u2019s strategy ( ;  ) and also reason about how the opponent may infer our current strategies ( ). In contrast, such bilateral, higher-order processes may not be invoked when people play against a computer opponent operating according to some fixed strategy. In other words, human choice behavior in a competitive situation can be expected to depend heavily on the nature of the opponent and how the opponent makes decisions. \n\nMany neuroimaging studies have shown that the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is associated with \u2018theory of mind\u2019\u2014the ability to infer the agency and mind state of another ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The right TPJ (RTPJ) has been suggested to be involved in inferring others\u2019 mental states in various social situations (e.g. moral judgment,  ; distribution,  ; risky decision making,  ). The left TPJ (LTPJ) is also important for representing and inferring another\u2019s beliefs ( ;  ). Human imaging studies have suggested that the LTPJ is associated with attending to the gap in perspective between self and other ( ;  ;  ). Although the functional roles of TPJ in inferring others\u2019 beliefs have been progressively revealed, details remain elusive concerning the TPJ\u2019s involvement in the higher-order recognition that others also infer one\u2019s own beliefs during strategic decision making. \n\nIn this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated how the bilateral TPJs associated with ToM were involved in competitive decision making, in which correct inference of another\u2019s inference about one\u2019s own belief is essential. Participants played an economic game (the \u2018asymmetric matching pennies game\u2019:  ) in the MRI scanner against three types of opponents: a human opponent who played the game from outside the scanner and two artificial agents (FIX and LRN) whose choices followed computer algorithms (which was explicitly noted in participant instructions). Thus, neither FIX nor LRN involved human agency, and their choice algorithms were quite different from each other. FIX followed a fixed probabilistic mixed strategy according to a game-theoretic Nash equilibrium, without any inference of the participant\u2019s strategy. On the other hand, LRN was programmed to predict the participant\u2019s choice strategy and adjust its own choices using a machine-learning technique. As both the human opponent and LRN were expected to be responsive to the participant\u2019s choices in a bilateral manner, we expected that the participant\u2019s choice behaviors against the human opponent and against LRN would be similar to each other, but different from those used against FIX. Thus, we investigated how the neural activities of RTPJ and LTPJ were associated with both the perception of human agency and the higher-order recognition of the other agent\u2019s inference about one\u2019s own strategy in the competitive game. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nWe scanned 30 right-handed student participants (14 females and 16 males; aged 18 to 22\u00a0years, mean\u2009=\u200919.3\u00a0years) at the University of Tokyo with no history of neurological or psychiatric illness. Thirty gender-matched, right-handed students (aged 18 to 22\u00a0years, mean\u2009=\u200919.4\u00a0years) also participated in this experiment as human opponents who played the game outside the scanner. The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Department of Social Psychology in the University of Tokyo. All participants gave written informed consent prior to the experiment. \n\n\n### Task \n  \nThe participants played the \u2018asymmetric matching pennies game\u2019 in the MRI scanner with three types of opponents: the human opponent (HUM) who played the game outside the scanner and the two artificial agents (FIX and LRN). FIX\u2019s choices were determined stochastically according to the mixed Nash strategy, while LRN used a machine-learning algorithm to attempt to predict and exploit the participant\u2019s choices. In the instructions, the human opponent was described as a student of the same sex at the same university, FIX as a computer program that would always follow a fixed, economically rational strategy and LRN as a computer program that would constantly learn to predict the participant\u2019s choices through interaction. \n\nAt the beginning of each trial, a cue indicating the type of opponent (HUM, FIX or LRN) was presented for 0.5\u00a0s ( ). Then two choice options were presented on the left and right sides of the display. The participant was asked to choose either option within 2\u00a0s. Immediately after either button was pressed, the frame of the chosen option was colored red. After a jittered fixation duration (2, 4 or 6\u00a0s), the choice of the opponent was indicated by a green frame, along with the outcome amount for the participant displayed at the center. After a jittered inter-trial interval (ITI) (2, 4 or 6\u00a0s), the next trial began. \n  \nTask sequence (A) and payoff matrix (B). A. In each trial, a conditional cue was presented for 0.5\u00a0s. Two options were presented on the left and right sides of the display for 2\u00a0s. When the participant pressed a button, the frame of the chosen option was colored red. After a jittered fixation duration, the choice of the opponent was shown as a green frame along with the monetary outcome the participant obtained. ITI\u2009=\u2009inter-trial interval. B. The participant won the game when his/her choice matched with the opponent\u2019s choice. The participant received 60 JPY by winning with the left choice (\u2018star\u2019) and 20 JPY by winning with the right choice (\u2018diamond\u2019) but received nothing for losing the game. The combination of left/right, star/diamond and outcome amounts was counterbalanced across participants. \n  \nThe participant won the game and received a monetary reward when their choice matched the opponent\u2019s choice. As shown in  , the participant received 60 JPY if both participant and opponent selected the left choice (\u2018star\u2019 in this example) and 20 JPY if both selected the right choice (\u2018diamond\u2019), while the opponent received nothing in either case. In contrast, when the two selections did not match, the participant received nothing, while the opponent received 40 JPY for \u2018star\u2019 or 20 JPY for \u2018diamond\u2019. Thus, the game payoff was asymmetric between the two players. We adopted this asymmetric payoff to make the game-theoretic probabilistic mixed strategy different from a random 50\u201350 choice; if the payoffs were symmetrical, it would be impossible to distinguish the game-theoretically rational strategy from a purely random choice ( ;  ). The combination of left/right sides, star/diamond shapes and outcome amounts was counterbalanced across participants. The participant\u2019s understanding of the payoff matrix was confirmed by a series of quizzes prior to the experiment. \n\nThe choice behavior in this study is characterized by how the participants balance between choosing the option (\u2018star\u2019 in the example) that could yield the higher outcome (high choice, hereafter) and the option (\u2018diamond\u2019) with the lower outcome (low choice). As mentioned earlier, we expected that participants\u2019 high choice rates in the HUM condition would be more similar to those in the LRN condition than in the FIX condition. \n\nEach of four fMRI runs included 3 blocks, with 12 consecutive trials in each block. During each block, the participant played the game against the same opponent. The order of the opponent blocks was counterbalanced across participants. The participants performed 144 trials in total (i.e. 48 trials for each of the three opponents). The participants received the accumulated monetary outcomes in the experiment as a bonus in addition to a fixed compensation of 3000 JPY (approximately 30 USD) for a participant of fMRI or 1000 JPY (approximately 10 USD) for a participant of human opponent. \n\nStimuli were presented on an MRI-compatible 32\u00a0inch LCD display with a resolution of 1920 pixels by 1080 pixels (NordicNeuroLab, Norway) placed at back of the MR bore. An MRI-compatible response pad (Current Designs, USA) was used to record responses. Psychtoolbox ( ) running on MATLAB (Mathworks Inc.) was used to present stimuli and record the responses. \n\n\n### Details of the opponents \n  \nThe participants played the game against three types of opponents. One was a human opponent (HUM) who was also a student of the University of Tokyo, with the same gender as the participant. The human opponent played the game outside the scanner. The computer opponent FIX made choices according to the probability dictated by the mixed strategy of the Nash equilibrium. In the example payoff matrix shown in  , FIX chooses the star with the probability of one-fourth and the diamond with the probability of three-fourths. The corresponding mixed strategy for the participant against FIX would be a probabilistic choice of one-third for the star and two-thirds for the diamond. The choice probability of FIX was fixed at the equilibrium rate regardless of the participant\u2019s choices. The other computer opponent LRN learned and predicted the participant\u2019s choices using a machine-learning algorithm (specifically, a perceptron with a sigmoid activation function:  ). LRN considered the choices of the participant (high/low), its own choices (high/low) and the results (win/loss) of the most recent six trials, plus the average bias of the participant toward the high choice (which was represented as a single constant term in the learning algorithm). Thus, the perceptron received 19 inputs (=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20096\u2009+\u20091) in each trial (represented by    x    below; see   for details about each variable). The following equation was used to determine the probability of high choice for LRN: \n\nEach of the 19 elements,   w  , in the weight vector    w    that corresponds to each of the 19 inputs ( ) was updated every trial using the following equation: where \n\nThe learning rate,   a  , was set to 0.25 throughout the experiment, which was determined by pilot tests. The choice data in the practice session was used to determine the initial    w   .   T   was set equal to 1 if the participant\u2019s choice was low choice, otherwise 0. \n\n\n### Model-based analysis \n  \nWe compared the following three models to explain the choice behavior of participants. The first was a standard reinforcement learning (RL) model, and the second was a winning rate maximization (WRM) model, which is a variant of an RL model. The third was a quantal response equilibrium (QRE) model that can yield an equilibrium with bounded rationality different from the Nash equilibrium ( ;  ). The RL model assumes that the choice probabilities are adjusted to maximize accumulated payoff outcomes for the participant. The WRM model posits that the choice probabilities are updated to maximize the participant\u2019s winning rate. The QRE model assumes that the choice probabilities are calculated based on the expected values estimated from the opponent\u2019s choice probability and payoff. \n\nBoth RL and WRM models assume that the participant learns the subjective values of chosen options based on the prediction error, i.e. the difference between the participant\u2019s subjective or predicted value for the chosen option and the actual outcome. The subjective values of the high and low choices in the RL model,   and  , were updated in a trial-by-trial manner according to the following equation: where the parameter   r  (  t  )  indicates the reward amount that the participant received at the   t  -th trial. The parameter   \u03b1   is the learning rate, dictating how much each update influences the learned value. Probabilities of the high and low choices were calculated using the softmax function:\n \nwhere the parameter   \u03b2   indicates the sensitivity to the learned values. When   \u03b2   approaches zero, the choice becomes random. When   \u03b2   increases, the choice probability of the option with larger value approaches one. \n\nThe WRM model is a variant of the RL model. The subjective values of the high and low choices in the WRM model were updated in a trial-by-trial manner according to the following equation: where   \u03b1   is the learning rate. Probabilities of the high and low choices were calculated using the softmax function:\n \n\nIn the WRM model, regardless of the amount of the outcome,   r  (  t  )  was 1 when the participant won, otherwise   r  (  t  )  was 0. (In the analysis, we aligned   r  (  t  )  of the RL model to be 1 or one-thirds instead of 60 or 20 JPY when the participant won, and 0 when the participant lost, so that the range of   r  (  t  ) for the RL model matched with that of the WRM model.) \n\nWe also examined a QRE model to see whether participants\u2019 choice behaviors were explained by the expected values of options. The expected value could be calculated by multiplying the opponent\u2019s choice probability and the payoff. The probabilities of high and low choices were calculated across four fMRI runs, for each opponent of each participant. The participant\u2019s probabilities of the high and low choices were estimated using the following equation:\n \nwhere   EV   and   EV   indicate expected values of the high and low choices, respectively. \n\nTo individually estimate the parameters of \u03b1 and \u03b2 from the behavioral data, we used the Broyden\u2013Fletcher\u2013Goldfarb\u2013Shanno algorithm included in the Optimization Toolbox of MATLAB. The models were compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) ( ). \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nA 3T Prisma scanner (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) was used to acquire functional images using a 64-ch head/neck coil. Mild cushioning minimized participant head movement. Sixty-eight slices of functional images were acquired using blood oxygenation level-dependent imaging (192\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009192\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009136\u00a0mm, in-plane resolution\u2009=\u200996\u2009\u00d7\u200996, voxel size\u2009=\u20092\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u00a0mm, thickness\u2009=\u20092\u00a0mm, TR\u2009=\u20091.5\u00a0s, TE\u2009=\u200925\u00a0ms, FA\u2009=\u200970\u00b0) using multi-band gradient-echo echo-planar sequences ( ;  ;  ) with multi-band factor\u2009=\u20094. The slices were rotated 30 degrees from the AC-PC plane to the forehead to minimize the artifact due to the sinus. The images covered the entire cerebrum after the rotation. We acquired 320 volumes in each fMRI run of the main experiment and 196 volume scans in the functional localizer task. \n\n\n### Image pre-processing \n  \nWe used SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, University College London) in MATLAB to process the scanned images. We performed slice-timing correction using the middle slice as a reference, scan-to-scan realignment, normalization to the EPI template of SPM12, resampling the images with the voxel size of 2\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u00a0mm and spatial smoothing (full width at half maximum of isotropic Gaussian kernel\u2009=\u20098\u00a0mm). A high-pass filter of 128\u00a0s was used to remove low frequency noise in the main and localizer experiments. \n\n\n### Image processing \n  \nAs many studies have revealed that the ventral striatum (VS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) are involved in learning behaviors based on RL ( ;  ;  ; see also  ), we examined whether the VS and VMPFC were associated with the prediction error of option value \u0394  V   in the first general linear model analysis (GLM1). The conditions of opponent type (HUM/FIX/LRN) were modeled for both the choice phase and feedback phase. GLM1 included the parametric modulations of prediction error \u0394  V   in the feedback phase for the opponent types separately. \n\nWe also included the brain activation for the high choice and low choice in each of the conditions analyzed in the second general linear model analysis (GLM2). For the choice phase, we prepared six conditions by combining choice (high/low)\u2009\u00d7\u2009opponent (HUM/FIX/LRN). The duration for each trial was measured from the onset (appearance of the choice options) to the button press indicating a choice. For the feedback phase, we prepared six conditions by combining result (win/loss)\u2009\u00d7\u2009opponent (HUM/FIX/LRN). The duration of these conditions was 2\u00a0s from the onset (appearance of feedback). The condition for button presses was also included in the design matrix. \n\n\n### Region of interest analysis for RTPJ and LTPJ \n  \nTo analyze the activation in RTPJ and LTPJ, we performed an analysis of regions of interest (ROIs) ( ). The RTPJ and LTPJ were individually identified using a functional localizer task for ToM that was performed after the main task ( ). In the localizer task, participants were first presented with stories about human agents who held false beliefs (false belief condition:  , upper panel) or stories about outdated physical objects (false photo condition:  , lower panel); after each, participants were queried for their inferences about the respective situations. \n\nFor the ROI definition, the peak coordinates of RTPJ and LTPJ were first identified in the group-level analysis, using the contrast of false belief condition   vs   false photo condition. Then, the individual peak within 10\u00a0mm from the group peak was identified in RTPJ and LTPJ. The ROI of RTPJ/LTPJ was individually defined as an 8\u00a0mm sphere centered at the individual peak. Not all individual ROIs overlapped due to their sizes and positions. The beta estimates in RTPJ and LTPJ in GLM2 reflecting brain activities in the choice phase and the feedback phase were extracted using MarsBaR ( ) and sent to further statistical analyses. \n\nWe also performed a multivariate pattern analysis to examine the similarity of brain activation patterns during the game against the three types of opponents. Here, we focused on the brain activity in the ROI during the choice phase. Because we were concerned with the overall similarity (or distance) of the LTPJ/RTPJ activation patterns in the HUM condition with those in the FIX and LRN conditions, we used representational similarity analysis (RSA,  ), rather than pattern classification analysis (e.g. support vector machine, which evaluates the accuracy of classification of an activation pattern in an ROI by defining a hyperplane as the border between the conditions:  ). We first calculated spatial correlations (Spearman\u2019s rank-order correlation) between the beta estimates for the six conditions of choice (high/low)\u2009\u00d7\u2009opponent (HUM/FIX/LRN) and then created a representational distance matrix (RDM,  ;  ) by subtracting these correlations from one. The RDM in this study was a symmetric 6\u2009\u00d7\u20096 matrix, where the off-diagonal elements indicated the distances of pairs among the six (choice \u00d7 opponent) conditions. \n\nTo see which artificial agent (FIX or LRN) solicited participant responses that better represented their response patterns to actual human opponents (HUM) at the neural level (i.e. activities of LTPJ/RTPJ identified by the functional localizer with the ToM task), we first collapsed high and low choices and then compared the Fisher-  z  -transformed Spearman\u2019s correlation of HUM\u2013LRN with that of HUM\u2013FIX. We hypothesized that the activity pattern for HUM would be significantly more similar to that for LRN (the learning agent) than to FIX (the agent using fixed mixed strategy), because LRN (like HUM) was responsive to the participants\u2019 choices in a bilateral manner, while FIX was not. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nAs shown in  , the participants\u2019 high choice rates decreased over the course of the session. A two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) over opponent (HUM/FIX/LRN)\u2009\u00d7\u2009fMRI runs yielded a significant main effect of fMRI run,   F  \u2009=\u200912.0,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001. A planned contrast between HUM\u2013LRN combined   vs   FIX was also significant (  F  \u2009=\u20096.08,   P  \u2009=\u20090.020), supporting our hypothesis that participants\u2019 choice behaviors would be similar between HUM and LRN but distinct from FIX. The percentage of high choices in the HUM condition was also significantly correlated with that of LRN condition (  r  \u2009=\u20090.60,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001;  ) but not with that of FIX condition (  r  \u2009=\u20090.20,   P  \u2009=\u20090.28;  ). The high choice rates in FIX and LRN conditions were also not correlated with each other (  r  \u2009=\u20090.13,   P  \u2009=\u20090.49,  ). \n  \nBehavioral results. (A) Percentage of high choices in four fMRI runs. The participants significantly reduced their high choice rates over time. A planned contrast between HUM-LRN combined and FIX was also significant. (B) Significant correlation of high choice rates between HUM and LRN conditions (  r  \u2009=\u20090.60,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001). (C) No significant correlation of High choice rates between HUM and FIX conditions (  r  \u2009=\u20090.20,   P  \u2009=\u20090.28). (D) No significant correlation of high choice rates between FIX and LRN conditions (  r  \u2009=\u20090.13,   P  \u2009=\u20090.49). (E) No significant difference in winning rates among the opponent types. (F) Monetary outcomes in each opponent condition. The outcomes in HUM and LRN conditions (not distinguishable from each other) were significantly higher than that in FIX condition. The asterisks indicate statistical significance (  P  \u2009<\u20090.001). \n  \nThe winning rates (collapsed over the high and low choices) were all approximately 0.5 ( ; one-sample   t   test: HUM,   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22121.08,   P  \u2009=\u20090.29; FIX,   t  \u2009=\u20090.15,   P  \u2009=\u20090.88; LRN,   t  \u2009=\u20090.22,   P  \u2009=\u20090.83) and not significantly different among the three opponent conditions (one-way repeated-measures ANOVA,   F  \u2009=\u20090.41,   P  \u2009=\u20090.67). The monetary outcomes that participants obtained in the HUM and LRN conditions were not distinguishable from each other ( :   t  \u2009=\u20090.56,   P  \u2009=\u20090.58), but both were significantly higher than those in the FIX condition (  vs   HUM,   t  \u2009=\u20095.56,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001;   vs   LRN,   t  \u2009=\u20095.83,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001; see also   for details). \n\nWe confirmed that the estimated learning rate of human opponent was similar to the learning rate of LRN (which had been set to 0.25), although the WRM and RL models were different from the learning model of LRN. The learning rates estimated using the WRM and RL models for the human opponent were 0.26\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06 and 0.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07 (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM), respectively, which were not significantly different from that of LRN (RL:   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.38,   P  \u2009=\u20090.71; WRM:   t  \u2009=\u20090.18,   P  \u2009=\u20090.86). Next, we examined the learning rate of the participant using the WRM model. The learning rates estimated in the HUM condition (0.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08) and the LRN condition (0.40\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06) were indistinguishable from each other (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.80,   P  \u2009=\u20090.43) and correlated (Spearman\u2019s   r  \u2009=\u20090.51,   P  \u2009=\u20090.0044\u2009<\u20090.01). On the other hand, neither the correlation of the learning rates between the HUM and FIX conditions (Spearman\u2019s   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.082,   P  \u2009=\u20090.67) nor that between the LRN and FIX conditions (Spearman\u2019s   r  \u2009=\u20090.198,   P  \u2009=\u20090.29) was significant. These results indicate that learning processes were similar between the HUM condition and the LRN condition but different from the FIX condition. \n\nThe response times for choices were similar among all three opponent conditions (HUM: 511\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u00a0ms; FIX: 487\u2009\u00b1\u200922\u00a0ms; LRN: 476\u00a0ms\u2009\u00b1\u200922\u00a0ms; mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM,   F  \u2009=\u20091.30,   P  \u2009=\u20090.28 by a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA). \n\n\n### Model comparison \n  \nWe compared the WRM model, RL model and QRE model in terms of goodness of fit to the participants\u2019 behavioral choices. The AIC of the WRM model was smaller than those of the RL model and the QRE model in all three conditions ( ), indicating that the WRM model achieved the best fit to the participants\u2019 choices. The posterior predictive check on the WRM model showed significantly higher match rates (relative to the chance level) in all three conditions, whereas the RL model showed a significantly higher match rate only in the FIX condition ( ). Furthermore, the WRM model also best explained the choice behaviors of the human opponents who played the game outside the scanner. However, it should be noted that even the best-fitting WRM model was able to capture only 58.5% of the participants\u2019 actual choices at most ( ) and the difference in AIC between the WRM and RL models was also very small ( ). Therefore, the following analysis of imaging data used both the WRM and the RL models. \n  \nAICs of the three models considered in this study \n  \nNote. The row for HUM  shows AICs of the three models when fitted to the choices of the human opponents who played the game from outside the scanner. \n  \n\n### Whole brain activation for \u0394V  and \u0394V \n  \nThe analysis for parametric modulation of \u0394  V   and \u0394  V   in GLM1 using the standard threshold (  P  \u2009<\u20090.001 for cluster identification without correction,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 for cluster level significance with FWE correction) showed the activation of various and large regions ( ), so we used a stricter threshold (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05 for voxel level significance with FWE correction, cluster size threshold   k  \u2009>\u200950).   shows clear activations of VS and VMPFC in response to both \u0394  V   and \u0394  V  , as in the previous imaging studies using variants of RL models (e.g.  ). The activities shown by the WRM and RL models ( ) mostly overlapped, in accord with the results of the model comparisons ( ). \n  \nImaging results of the whole brain analysis for the parametric modulation of prediction errors, \u0394  V   and \u0394  V  . The activation for prediction errors was observed in the VS and the VMPFC.

The overlapping region is colored violet. \n    \nSummary of the results of parametric modulation analysis \n  \nL, left; R, right; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex. \n  \n\n### Activation difference of RTPJ and LTPJ \n  \nRTPJ and LTPJ were individually identified using the functional localizer in this study ( , see also   and  ). The peak coordinates in the group-level analysis with the stricter threshold (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05 for voxel level significance with FWE correction:  ) were used to identify the individual peaks in RTPJ and LTPJ and their activities while the participants played the game were extracted and compared. The LTPJ was activated in the choice phase, whereas the RTPJ was activated in the feedback phase, as shown in   and confirmed by a significant interaction in a two-way repeated measures ANOVA [phase (choice/feedback)\u2009\u00d7\u2009ROIs (LTPJ/RTPJ);   F  \u2009=\u200924.3,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001]. In comparisons, the LTPJ showed the significantly higher activation than the RTPJ in the choice phase (  t  \u2009=\u20092.79,   P  \u2009=\u20090.009), and the activation of RTPJ was significantly higher than that of LTPJ in the feedback phase (  t  \u2009=\u20095.46,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001). More specifically, the activation of RTPJ was significantly higher than zero in the feedback phase (  t  \u2009=\u20097.31,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, Bonferroni corrected for the number of ROIs) but not in the choice phase (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.95,   P  \u2009=\u20090.70, Bonferroni corrected). In contrast, the activation of LTPJ was significantly higher than zero in the choice phase (  t  \u2009=\u20092.49,   P  \u2009=\u20090.019, Bonferroni corrected) but not in the feedback phase (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.68,   P  \u2009=\u20090.50, Bonferroni corrected). \n  \nActivation in the ROIs of RTPJ and LTPJ. A. The individually defined LTPJ and RTPJ, identified using the theory-of-mind functional localizer (see Supplementary  ). The color reflects the number of overlapped individual ROIs. B. Activation of LTPJ and RTPJ in the choice and feedback phases. The phase\u2013ROI interaction was significant, indicating that the LTPJ was activated in the choice phase, while the RTPJ was activated in the feedback phase. The asterisks indicate statistical significance (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001). \n    \nSummary of the group-level results of the functional localizer \n  \nL\u2009=\u2009left, R\u2009=\u2009right. \n  \n\n### RTPJ activity \n  \nWe compared the brain activation of RTPJ in the choice phase for the combination of three opponents (HUM/FIX/LRN) and two choice options (high/low). Although the overall activation level was not statistically distinguishable from zero during the choice phase (  left), the main effect of opponent was significant by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA (  F  \u2009=\u20096.90,   P  \u2009=\u20090.002 after Bonferroni correction for the number of ROIs:  ). The RTPJ activation was significantly higher in HUM than in FIX and LRN conditions (post-hoc Tukey\u2013Kramer test, both   P  \u2009<\u20090.01). \n  \nImaging results for RTPJ. A. The activation of RTPJ in the choice phase. Although the overall activation was not statistically distinguishable from zero (see  ), the main effect of opponent was significant by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA over opponent (HUM/FIX/LRN)\u2009\u00d7\u2009choice (high/low): RTPJ activation was significantly higher in HUM than in FIX and LRN conditions. B. Activation of RTPJ in the feedback phase. RTPJ activation was significantly higher in the HUM condition than in the FIX and LRN conditions. The asterisks indicate statistical significance (  P  \u2009<\u20090.01,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001). \n  \nAs seen in  , this main effect was also clearly observed in the feedback phase in which the overall activation of RTPJ was significantly greater than zero (  right). A two-way repeated measures ANOVA of opponent (HUM/FIX/LRN)\u2009\u00d7\u2009result (win/loss) revealed the significant main effect of opponent type (  F  \u2009=\u200918.4,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 after Bonferroni correction for the number of ROIs), and the post-hoc Tukey\u2013Kramer test again confirmed that the brain activation in HUM condition was significantly larger than those in FIX and LRN condition (both   P  \u2009<\u20090.001). Taken together, these patterns suggest that the activation of RTPJ reflected the perception of human agency when the participants played against the human opponent outside of the scanner. \n\nIn line with the absence of overall activation in the choice phase (  left), RTPJ activity had no significant relation with behavioral choices in any of the three conditions. As shown in  , correlations between participant\u2019s high choice rate and RTPJ beta for high choice were all non-significant (HUM:   r  \u2009=\u20090.16,   P  \u2009=\u20090.39; FIX:   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.09,   P  \u2009=\u20090.64; LRN:   r  \u2009=\u20090.33,   P  \u2009=\u20090.08). \n\n\n### LTPJ activity \n  \nWe examined the LTPJ activation similarly to that of the RTPJ. LTPJ activation showed no significant effect in a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA over opponent (HUM/FIX/LRN)\u2009\u00d7\u2009choice (high/low) either in the choice phase ( ) or the feedback phase ( ). \n\nIn the behavioral results ( ), we observed that the high choice rate in the HUM condition was remarkably similar to the LRN condition but clearly distinct from the FIX condition. A similar pattern can be observed for LTPJ activation in the choice phase (  left). Consistent with this conjecture, LTPJ activation for high choice was significantly correlated with the high choice rate in the HUM and LRN conditions, but this relationship was weak in the FIX condition ( ; HUM:   r  \u2009=\u20090.48,   P  \u2009=\u20090.007; FIX:   r  \u2009=\u20090.34,   P  \u2009>\u20090.10; LRN:   r  \u2009=\u20090.43,   P  \u2009=\u20090.018, Bonferroni corrected for the number of ROIs). \n  \nImaging results in the LTPJ and results of RSA in the TPJs. A. The relation between LTPJ activation for high choice and the high choice rate. Significant correlation was observed in HUM and LRN conditions but not in FIX condition. B. Schema to calculate RDM. Beta estimates were extracted from the individually defined TPJ, and then the correlation matrix of the beta estimates was calculated and converted to the RDM. C. The RDM of activation in the LTPJ. The color bar shows the distance between conditions. D. The difference of Fisher-  z  -transformed correlations of HUM-FIX and HUM-LRN. The Fisher-  z  -transformed correlation of HUM-LRN was significantly higher than that of HUM-FIX. The asterisk indicates statistical significance (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05). E. The RDM of activation in the RTPJ. The color bar shows the distance between the conditions. F. Similar activity patterns of RTPJ between HUM-FIX and HUM-LRN comparisons. The Fisher-  z  -transformed correlation was not significantly different between HUM-FIX and HUM-LRN. \n  \nThese results indicate that LTPJ activity in the HUM condition may be more similar to that in the LRN condition than to that in the FIX condition. We compared the activity patterns of the HUM, FIX and LRN conditions using a RSA. First, the beta estimates in the choice phase between the six conditions [choice (high/low)\u2009\u00d7\u2009opponent (HUM/FIX/LRN)] were extracted from the LTPJ ROI ( ). Next, the distance in each pair of the six conditions was defined as 1 minus the spatial correlation of beta estimates. The RDM of LTPJ indicated that the activity pattern was similar within each opponent type but less similar across the opponent types ( ). Most importantly, the Fisher-  z  -transformed correlations showed that the activation pattern of LTPJ in the HUM condition was more similar to that in the LRN condition than to that in the FIX condition ( :   t  \u2009=\u20092.12,   P  \u2009=\u20090.042, Bonferroni corrected for the number of ROIs). However, no such dissociation among the three conditions was observed in the activation pattern in RTPJ (  F:   t  \u2009=\u20090.38,   P  \u2009=\u20090.71, Bonferroni corrected for the number of ROIs; in contrast to the RSA approach, the classifier approach using a support vector machine did not yield significantly higher classification above the chance level for either LTPJ or RTPJ\u2014see  ). In the feedback phase, the activation patterns in LTPJ (and also RTPJ) were not dissociable among the three conditions ( ). Taken together, these results may indicate that LTPJ is involved in second-order inferences (inferring another agent\u2019s inferences about one\u2019s own belief) when making competitive strategic choices. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis fMRI study investigated the behavioral and neural bases for strategic decision making when the participant must consider an opponent\u2019s inferences about the participant\u2019s own beliefs in a bilateral manner. As hypothesized, the participants\u2019 choice behaviors against the human opponent (HUM) were remarkably close to those against LRN, which learned and exploited the participant\u2019s prior choices, as compared with those against FIX, which always followed a fixed probabilistic strategy. The model-based analyses showed that the participants\u2019 choice behaviors were better predicted by a learning model that maximized winning rate rather than monetary outcome. We also confirmed that winning was rewarding in itself, as shown by the activation of VS and VMPFC associated with the prediction error of the winning rate (\u0394  V  ). Furthermore, RTPJ and LTPJ, identified by the ToM localizer, showed double dissociation of activation and activity patterns between the choice and feedback phases. The activation of RTPJ in the feedback phase was significantly larger when playing against the human opponent (HUM) than the computer opponents (FIX and LRN). In contrast, the activity patterns of LTPJ in the choice phase showed a greater similarity between HUM and LRN conditions than between HUM and FIX conditions, paralleling the significant correlation between the participants\u2019 choice behaviors and the corresponding LTPJ activity in HUM and LRN (but not in FIX) conditions. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, we assumed two main features of the human opponent in this study: human agency and strategic bilateral inference about the participant\u2019s choice behaviors. Obviously, neither computer agent had human agency. But similar to HUM, LRN learned and constantly adjusted to the participant\u2019s choice behavior for possible exploitation, while FIX did not and instead followed a fixed choice probability. The double dissociation we have observed in this study seems to reflect these two features (human agency and bilateral strategic inference). In the following, we first discuss these differential activations of RTPJ and LTPJ in more detail. \n\nRTPJ activation was larger for the human opponent than for the computer opponents (FIX and LRN) in the feedback phase, while its activity was negligible in the choice phase and also uncorrelated with the participants\u2019 high choice rates. In previous research using behavioral games (e.g.  ), human face pictures (in contrast to computer pictures) have often been used to increase participants\u2019 feelings of an opponent\u2019s human agency. However, because we were concerned that such manipulation might also evoke differences in arousal or emotional states beyond the perception of human agency, we presented only a word cue to signal that the opponent in the current trial was either a student of the same university or a computer. We still observed a significant difference in RTPJ activation between the HUM condition and the two computer conditions. \n\nIn contrast, LTPJ activation in the choice phase was correlated with high choice rate in the HUM and LRN conditions, but not in the FIX condition; behaviorally, high choice rate in HUM was also correlated with that in LRN, but not with FIX. Moreover, LTPJ activity patterns, as identified by the RSA, were similar between the HUM and LRN conditions, but not between HUM and FIX. These behavioral and neuroimaging results indicate that the LTPJ is involved in strategic decision making against an opponent that can actively learn from the prior actions of the player and infer their future actions. Previous studies have suggested that the LTPJ is associated with perceiving differences between the mental states of self and other ( ;  ;  ). A recent study by  )) also reported a similar result involving the LTPJ in the context of a trust game. These researchers found a significant correlation between strength of LTPJ connectivity (e.g. with posterior superior temporal sulcus) and investment behavior when participants made trust decisions with a human counterpart, but not when they made the same investment decisions in a non-social control game. These results corroborate the argument that LTPJ activity reflects elements of social decision making. \n\nTaken together, our results showed a functional dissociation of RTPJ and LTPJ in a strategic decision making context. The RTPJ is involved in the perception of the human agency that constitutes a basis for reasoning about the opponent\u2019s mental state ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), whereas the LTPJ may be involved in strategic planning of choices against intelligent, bilaterally-responsive agents, be they human or non-human. \n\nIn this study, we identified the ROIs of LTPJ and RTPJ for each of the participants separately, using the ToM localizer ( ). Notice that the individual identification of functional brain regions was used not only for comparing activation between conditions but also for comparing activity patterns through RSA. The former compared the averaged activities in each ROI, whereas the latter examined the voxel-scale similarities/differences of activity in the ROI. That is, these two analyses reflected different aspects of neural activity. We believe that the ToM localizer, which enables using exactly the same ROI throughout the two analyses, will thus be beneficial in future research that investigates functional dissociations between RTPJ and LTPJ in strategic decision making. \n\nIt could be argued that the asymmetric payoff matrix employed in this study may have introduced the possibility of social preferences (e.g. inequity aversion, empathy, etc.) biasing participants\u2019 computations of value when making choices. It is true that the asymmetric payoff matrix allowed participants to earn more than the human opponent if they played the mixed strategy of the Nash equilibrium, and this may have triggered reactions of empathy or advantageous inequity aversion. We thus additionally analyzed the activation of the anterior insula (AI), which has been shown to be associated with such social preferences ( ;  ;  ; but see   indicating association of AI with other functions). The result showed no significant difference in AI activation between the win and loss feedback situations where inequity aversion could be at work ( ), which could imply that its influence was less evident in the competitive context of our matching-pennies game, as compared with a distributive context ( ). However, as we did not directly assess neural correlates of inequity aversion, the absence of AI activation remains only suggestive and should be treated with caution against reverse inference ( ;  ). Future research should address the role of social preferences in a competitive context more directly, along with possible involvement of other brain regions (e.g. TPJ:  ) in inequity aversion. \n\nFinally, our model-based behavior analysis showed that the WRM model was the best fit to the participants\u2019 choices, although the difference between the WRM model and the (second best) RL model in fitness was small. Activation related to the learning process specified by the WRM model and the RL model was observed (and mostly overlapped) in the VS and the VMPFC, the reward regions identified by previous studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). These indicate that winning itself worked as a reward for the participants as well as the monetary payoff. It could be argued that the participants might have felt the monetary reward in this experiment to be too small and thus focused more on winning. However, the participants were clearly instructed that the accumulated payoff outcome could be substantial and would be paid as a cash bonus. Furthermore, the accumulated payoff outcomes for the high choice were significantly larger than for the low choice in HUM and LRN conditions ( ), suggesting that the outcome difference between high and low choices was meaningful for the participants. Taken together, the results indicate that winning in itself, as well as the monetary outcomes, worked as a strong reward for the participants (cf.  ;  ). \n\nThis study investigated the neural basis for inferring an opponent\u2019s inferences about one\u2019s own beliefs in a competitive decision making context. Choice behaviors against the human opponent and LRN were systematically different from those against FIX. The RTPJ showed significantly higher activation in HUM condition than in the computer conditions in the feedback phase, while the LTPJ activity pattern showed higher similarity between HUM and LRN conditions than between HUM and FIX conditions. These results suggest that the RTPJ is mainly associated with the perception of human agency, and the LTPJ is involved in second-order inferences (those about others\u2019 inferences about one\u2019s own beliefs) in competitive situations. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI (JP25118004 and JP16H06324 to T.K. and JP16K16076 and 19K07807 to A.O.) and Japan Science and Technology Agency CREST (JPMJCR17A4 (17941861) to T.K.).

However, in racialized societies like the USA, youth from minoritized racial/ethnic backgrounds can have different experiences and perceptions within neighborhoods that share similar characteristics. The current study examined how neighborhood disadvantage intersects with racial/ethnic background in relation to neural sensitivity to social cues. A racially diverse (59 Hispanic/Latine, 48 White, 37 Black/African American, 15 multi-racial and 6 other) and primarily low to middle socioeconomic status sample of 165 adolescents (88 female;   M \u2009  =\u200912.89) completed a social incentive delay task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. We tested for differences in the association between neighborhood disadvantage and neural responses to social threat and reward cues across racial/ethnic groups. For threat processing, compared to White youth, neighborhood disadvantage was related to greater neural activation in regions involved in salience detection (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex) for Black youth and regions involved in mentalizing (e.g. temporoparietal junction) for Latine youth. For reward processing, neighborhood disadvantage was related to greater brain activation in reward, salience and mentalizing regions for Black youth only. This study offers a novel exploration of diversity within adolescent neural development and important insights into our understanding of how social environments may \u2018get under the skull\u2019 differentially across racial/ethnic groups. \n \n\n# Body\n \nA growing body of neuroimaging research underscores that the social environment, including neighborhood quality and socioeconomic status (SES), can tune the brain toward salient social information ( ;  ;  ), such as social rewards and threats. Indeed, individuals who grow up in disadvantaged social environments show altered neural sensitivity toward social threat ( ;  ) and monetary rewards ( ;  ). These patterns are assumed to be applicable across all individuals, or in other words, that all youth raised in lower-quality neighborhoods or lower SES households are likely to develop these neural patterns. However, in racialized societies such as the USA, one\u2019s racial/ethnic background plays a powerful role in how one experiences their social environment ( ). Not only are minoritized racial/ethnic groups more likely to live in systemically disadvantaged neighborhoods (e.g. segregation, lack of access to parks/green spaces and food deserts;  ;  ), they may also have different social experiences within similar environments (e.g. experiencing discrimination). Given the importance of race in the daily lives of US adolescents ( ), neighborhood disadvantage may have a larger influence in shaping neural sensitivity to social threat and reward in minoritized adolescents compared to White peers. There is a great need for developmental neuroscience not only to utilize diverse samples, but also to examine diversity within those samples (see  ). Thus, the purpose of the current study is to examine how neighborhood disadvantage interacts with racial/ethnic background in shaping neural processing of social threats and rewards in US adolescents. \n\nIt is important to note that race is a socially constructed label that has a strong impact on development, but has no biological or neural basis. Thus, in the present work we are not testing racial/ethnic differences in neural activation, but rather how one social experience (i.e.\u00a0neighborhood disadvantage) interacts with another social experience (i.e. racial/ethnic background) to shape neural activation toward social threats and rewards. Furthermore, we compare Black and Latine youth to White youth in the current work in an effort to contrast the impact of neighborhood disadvantage on societally marginalized groups (i.e.\u00a0Black and Latine) compared to the dominant racial group (White). This is not intended to treat neural activation in White youth as \u2018normative\u2019 or to apply any value labels to any racial/ethnic group (e.g. healthy, adaptive and risk factor). Rather, White is used as a comparison here to indicate an absence of experiences of systemic and interpersonal racism. \n\n## Neighborhoods and sensitivity to social threats and rewards \n  \nNeighborhoods have a clear and well-established influence on children and adolescents\u2019 social, emotional and behavioral development ( ). Youth in disadvantaged neighborhoods often experience more chronic stress, more threats to their safety, less predictability and less control over their circumstances ( ), and as such, face more struggles with mental health and sense of self-efficacy ( ;  ). Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that neighborhood disadvantage gets under the skin and influences biology. Research has identified associations between neighborhood disadvantage and stress physiology in both baseline cortisol levels ( ) and cortisol reactivity during a social stress task in adolescents ( ), as well as with faster cardiometabolic aging throughout young adulthood ( ). Thus, neighborhoods play a critical role in shaping important psychological and physiological outcomes for youth. \n\nResearch has also begun to investigate how neighborhood disadvantage impacts neural processing of social threats and rewards. Two studies using a mostly overlapping sample examined how neighborhood disadvantage in adolescence relates longitudinally to neural processing during threat tasks. During a social exclusion task, adults who lived in disadvantaged neighborhoods in their youth showed higher brain activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC;  ), brain regions that support social vigilance, threat monitoring, regulatory effort and mentalizing, among other processes. During a physical threat task, participants were offered social support from a stranger and a friend ( ). For adults from more advantaged backgrounds, brain activation was lower in the superior frontal gyrus, supplementary motor cortex, insula, putamen and thalamus when threat was experienced in the presence of a friend compared to a stranger. For those from disadvantaged backgrounds, however, the opposite was found, such that brain activation in these same regions was lower when threat was experienced with a stranger compared to a friend. Although the full meaning of these results and the underlying cognitive processes are unclear, these findings suggest that early life neighborhood disadvantage does relate to neural processing of threat in adulthood and that the calibration of threat detection may vary by social conditions and type of social stimuli. \n\nOther work has begun to examine the influence of neighborhoods on neural activity among youth. Along these lines, one study showed that neighborhood disadvantage in childhood related to greater amygdala activity in response to neutral faces in adolescence and young adulthood. These data suggest that there may be a negativity bias leading those who grew up in disadvantaged neighborhoods to perceive socially ambiguous cues as more threatening and/or salient ( ). Together, this one study in youth and two prior studies in adults offer initial evidence that neighborhood disadvantage relates to brain activation in regions associated with greater attunement to threats and more neural regulatory effort. \n\nRegarding neighborhood disadvantage and reward processing, the evidence is less clear, as the only two known studies on this topic used monetary reward tasks and show conflicting findings. In one study, neighborhood disadvantage was related to blunted activation in the dorsal and ventral striatum during reward anticipation in children ( ). In a second study, individuals who experienced neighborhood disadvantage during adolescence showed greater neural sensitivity to rewards in the ventral striatum as adults ( ). Given these conflicting findings, it is difficult to draw conclusions based on these two studies alone, but they do offer initial evidence that neighborhood disadvantage may be associated with neural processing of rewards. \n\nTogether, existing research suggests that neighborhood disadvantage relates to neural processing of both threats and rewards, but several important questions remain open. First, most previous studies did not use social cues, which may be especially relevant for research in adolescence, a developmental period when the social context becomes more important ( ). Second, prior research has assessed neighborhood disadvantage differently. Some utilized a census-based measure of neighborhood disadvantage reflective of the average SES of the neighborhood ( ;  ), which tells less about the social experiences within a neighborhood and is often considered to be a measure of SES rather than neighborhood environment ( ). Other research utilized a parent-report measure more focused on social experiences within the neighborhood, such as connectedness, crime/deterioration and risk ( ;  ,  ). It is unclear how measurement of neighborhood might shape findings, but recent evidence suggests that measurement does indeed matter. A study of children and adolescents found that a census-based measure of disadvantage related to greater amygdala reactivity to social threat only when their neighborhood was subjectively rated as less secure ( ). Due to the small body of research connecting neighborhood environments to brain activity and differences in measurement of neighborhood environments in past work, we first sought to examine the associations between neighborhood disadvantage and neural responses to threat and reward, regardless of race. However, given that nearly all prior studies have been done at the group level with little exploration of additional layers of social experience that may interact with the neighborhood context, we critically examine if the associations between neighborhood disadvantage and neural activity are generalizable across groups or if there are between-group differences that may vary based on race/ethnicity. \n\n\n## Race/ethnicity and neighborhood experiences \n  \nIt is important to examine potential racial/ethnic differences in how the neighborhood context is associated with neural sensitivity to social threat and reward. We stress that any differences across racial/ethnic background are not due to inherent biological differences, but can be thought of in terms of environmental affordances ( ). This refers to the extent that a given environment offers individuals or groups control over their environment, such as autonomy and opportunity, or constraint and limitation. It is well documented that certain racial/ethnic groups are minoritized by societal systems that keep them in lower social positions with fewer resources and opportunities, such as being segregated into disadvantaged neighborhoods and having limited access to healthcare, education, housing and upward economic mobility ( ;  ). Additionally, from an early age, minoritized individuals receive implicit and explicit messages about their race from parents, schools and the media, making them more aware of historical and current injustices and stereotypes ( ;  ;  ). Furthermore, minoritized individuals are more likely to experience or witness racial discrimination. These social experiences of structural and interpersonal racism may be additional physical and psychosocial stressors that influence minoritized groups differently than dominant groups, even when living in similar neighborhood conditions (see  ;  ). Furthermore, economic and social resources typically relate to improved mental and physical health, but this is not found in Black men and adolescents, showing that equal resources do not always result in equal benefits ( ;  ;  ). Thus, living in a more advantaged neighborhood may not confer the same benefits to all people and may depend on their experiences within that neighborhood. \n\nNot only are minoritized youth more likely to live in disadvantaged neighborhoods than White youth ( ), but they are also differentially influenced by the neighborhood context for outcomes such as mental health ( ;  ). For example, Black adults living in more affluent neighborhoods are still at higher risk for depression compared to White adults living in similar neighborhoods ( ). Furthermore, the protective effect of youth community involvement in disadvantaged neighborhoods varies across racial/ethnic groups ( ). Together, this suggests that neighborhood environments may have different effects for minoritized youth compared to White youth. There has been little exploration of whether racial/ethnic group membership might moderate the effect of the social environment on neural sensitivity to threats and rewards; however, there is some initial evidence for this possibility. One study found that neighborhood disadvantage is negatively associated with amygdala response to threat cues, but only for African American participants and not for European American participants ( ,  ). This finding offers initial evidence that racial/ethnic groups may experience and process neighborhood disadvantage differently, which impacts how the brain responds to threat. \n\n\n## Developmental timing \n  \nAdolescence is a time during which individuals become particularly sensitive to sociocultural influences ( ). During adolescence, the brain undergoes rapid changes in neural circuitry involved in socio-affective and socio-cognitive processing, making adolescents particularly sensitive to their social environment ( ;  ;  ). Concurrent with these neural changes, adolescents spend more time navigating their social worlds independently, becoming more aware of and thus more heavily influenced by their social context ( ). A considerable amount of research has shown that the effects of socioeconomic disadvantage on emotion, cognition and mental and physical health are present in childhood and adolescence ( ;  ;  ). Furthermore, racially minoritized youth become more likely to personally experience racial discrimination, witness instances of discrimination and receive and understand broader societal messages about race and inequality, making adolescence a time of significant development in racial/ethnic identity and critical awareness ( ). Together, these findings highlight the importance of studying the influence of social context on neural social processing during adolescence. \n\n\n## Current study \n  \nThe purpose of the current study was to investigate how youth in neighborhoods characterized by higher levels of threats and fewer opportunities for rewards anticipate social threats and rewards. Research on the association between neighborhood environments and brain functioning in adolescence is still limited; therefore, we first explore this association across our whole sample. However, it is also important to explore how these processes may differ across racial/ethnic groups who may experience neighborhood disadvantages differently. To address this, a diverse sample of adolescents completed an fMRI scan during which they anticipated potential social threats and rewards from age-matched peers. Neighborhood disadvantage was measured via parent report, including exposure to violence, presence of homelessness, drug use and social support. Importantly, we controlled for objective measures of SES (i.e.\u00a0parental education and income, economic strain and census-based information), which allowed us to test the unique role that the neighborhood environment plays above and beyond SES. We used a whole-brain, multiple regression approach to identify brain regions where activation toward social threats and rewards was differentially correlated with neighborhood disadvantage, and compared these across three racial/ethnic groups (i.e. Black/African American, Hispanic/Latine and White/European American). Although we took an exploratory whole-brain approach, we expected that Black and Latine youth in disadvantaged neighborhoods would show greater sensitivity to social threats and rewards compared to White youth and that these differences would be evident in greater activation in brain regions associated with threat monitoring (e.g. amygdala), salience detection (e.g. dACC and insula) and reward processing (e.g. ventral striatum). \n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were recruited from a larger study of 873 students in 6th and 7th grades in a small, diverse, rural community in the southeast USA. Participants from the larger study indicated interest in being contacted for a future fMRI study. Interested participants were then called and screened on the phone for eligibility (i.e. MRI contraindications) and recruited for the fMRI study within the same academic year as the larger study. Of the original 178 participants recruited into the neuroimaging sub-study, six were excluded from analyses due to not completing the scan, two for excessive motion (>2\u2009mm across >10% of volumes), two for technical errors, one for an artifact, one for an incidental finding and one for missing data on SES variables, leading to a total sample of 165 adolescents in the present analysis (88 female) aged 11\u201314\u2009years (  M \u2009  =\u200912.89,   s.d.\u2009  =\u20090.56). Adolescents were from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds (59 Hispanic/Latine, 48 White, 37 Black/African American, 15 multi-racial and 6 other) and from low to middle SES families (see\u00a0  for socioeconomic and demographic information). For racial/ethnic labels used in this study, teens self-identified by checking boxes with specific labels and had the chance to type in their own responses. Additionally, between 66.7% and 72.1% of students in these schools were classified as economically disadvantaged based on school reports ( ), and 69.5% of students in the district were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch based on district reports. Teens and parents gave written assent/consent to participate according to the university\u2019s Institutional Review Board. The majority of parents were adolescent\u2019s biological mothers (82%), but also included biological fathers (10%), other maternal figures (i.e.\u00a0aunt and grandmother; 6%) and other paternal figures (i.e.\u00a0stepfather and grandfather; 2%). Thirty-two parents completed all questionnaires in Spanish, which were translated and back translated by paid bilingual translators. All adolescent participants were proficient in and completed all materials in English. Data collection took place from December 2016 to May 2018. \n  \nDemographic and socioeconomic characteristics of sample \n  \nNote. Totals that do not add up to 100% indicate missing data for that variable. Some response categories were collapsed for parsimony. \n  \n\n### Measures \n  \nAt the time of the scan, parents of adolescents completed self-report measures of neighborhood disadvantage and SES. In addition, we obtained an objective measure of area disadvantage from census data. Scores presented here are in their original scales but all measures were   z  -scored for analyses. \n\n#### Neighborhood disadvantage \n  \nNeighborhood disadvantage was assessed via parent report ( ), similar to other studies ( ;  ). The scale included 15 yes or no questions [e.g. \u2018I see people using or selling drugs in my neighborhood\u2019, \u2018In my neighborhood there are a lot of poor people who don\u2019t have enough money for food and basic needs\u2019 and \u2018I feel safe when I walk around my neighborhood by myself\u2019 (reverse scored); \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.81], which were coded as yes\u2009=\u20091 and no\u2009=\u20090 and summed so that higher scores indicated greater disadvantage. Scores in the current sample ranged from 0 to 11 (  M\u2009  =\u20092.01,   s.d.\u2009  =\u20092.14). A full list of items and frequencies is included in the  ,  \n\n\n#### Socioeconomic status \n  \nAll analyses controlled for three measures of SES. First, we created a standardized score based on parental education (both primary and secondary caregiver when available) on a 1- (\u2018less than 8th grade\u2019) to 10- (\u2018professional degree [MD, PhD, etc.]\u2019) point scale and family\u2019s total annual income from the previous year on a 1- (\u2018$0-14\u2009999\u2019) to 10- (\u2018$150\u2009000+\u2019) point scale. Second, parents reported on economic hardship over the past 3\u00a0months ( ), including seven questions about their ability to afford life necessities (food, housing, medical care, etc.) on a 1- (\u2018not at all true for me\u2019) to 4- (\u2018very true for me\u2019) point scale (reverse coded), one question about difficulty paying bills on a 1- (\u2018no difficulty at all\u2019) to 4- (\u2018a great deal of difficulty\u2019) point scale and one question about having money left over at the end of the month on a 1- (\u2018with more than enough money left over\u2019) to 4- (\u2018very short of money\u2019) point scale. The nine items were averaged, with higher scores indicating greater economic hardship (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.93). Lastly, participants\u2019 residential addresses were used to derive an objective score on the Area Deprivation Index (ADI;  ) based on US Census data. The index is derived from information on income, education, employment and housing quality for each census block. Scores on the ADI represent a percentile of deprivation relative to the entire US population, with 1 indicating the most advantaged (top 1% of the USA) and 100 indicating the highest level of deprivation in the USA. \n\n\n\n### Social incentive delay task \n  \nParticipants completed the Social Incentive Delay Task ( ) while undergoing fMRI to measure neural responses to anticipating social rewards and threats (see\u00a0 ). Each trial began with a cue (i.e.\u00a0a shape) that signaled whether the upcoming image was a potential reward (i.e.\u00a0happy face), threat (i.e.\u00a0angry face) or neutral (i.e.\u00a0blurred face). Participants completed two rounds of the task, totaling 116 trials (48 reward, 48 threat and 20 neutral). In order to make the task motivationally salient, we used age-matched, racially diverse adolescent faces taken from the National Institute of Mental Health Child Emotional Faces Picture Set ( ). A full description of the task can be found in the  . \n  \nSocial incentive delay task. Each trial consists of an anticipation cue (circle, diamond or triangle), a jittered crosshair delay, a target (white square) signaling participants to press a button and feedback (e.g. reward/threat). Each cue and corresponding feedback depicted in the lower panel of the figure. \n  \n\n### fMRI data acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nA full description of fMRI data acquisition and preprocessing parameters can be found in the  . \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nIndividual-level, fixed-effects analyses were estimated using the general linear model convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function in SPM12. A full description of task modeling can be found in the  . The primary contrasts of interest for this study were the anticipation of threat   vs   neutral and anticipation of reward   vs   neutral. Focusing on anticipation rather than receipt is most common among similar incentive delay tasks ( ) and reflects a motivational state of avoidance or approach rather than disliking or liking ( ). We employed a whole-brain analysis for the threat   vs   neutral and reward   vs   neutral anticipation contrasts, using multiple regression analyses in which brain activity for these contrasts was regressed onto the variables of interest (i.e.\u00a0neighborhood disadvantage and race/ethnicity), controlling for the SES variables (all variables   z  -scored). We ran three regression analyses: one for the main effect of neighborhood disadvantage across the whole sample, one for the interaction of neighborhood and race/ethnicity comparing Black and White youth and one for the interaction of neighborhood and race/ethnicity comparing Latine and White youth. Although all adolescents were included in this model, we focused on the contrasts for Black   vs   White and Latine   vs   White. To correct for multiple comparisons, we ran Monte Carlo simulations using 3dClustSim in the AFNI software package (updated version April 2017;  ). We submitted the residuals generated from the random-effects, individual-level analysis to the 3dFWHMx program to calculate the spatial group smoothness, assuming an autocorrelation function (\u2013acf). Based on these simulations, we determined that to achieve a corrected threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.005, a cluster extent of 141\u00a0voxels was needed for the regressions of neighborhood disadvantage onto threat   vs   neutral anticipation and reward   vs   neutral anticipation. Whole-brain analyses for each contrast are available on Neurovault ( ;  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Descriptives \n  \nMeans, ranges and correlations among all study variables are presented in\u00a0 . The individual SES indicators are moderately correlated in the expected direction. As shown in\u00a0 , results from a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) comparing neighborhood disadvantage and SES across racial/ethnic groups indicate that there are some racial/ethnic differences in this sample,   F  (16, 489)\u2009=\u20094.35, Wilks\u2019 lambda\u2009=\u20090.666,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001. Specifically, Hispanic/Latine youth live in more disadvantaged neighborhoods and lower SES environments relative to other groups on all measures; Black youth are in lower SES environments relative to White youth in terms of parental education/income and area deprivation. \n  \nMeans, standard deviations and correlations among study variables \n  \nNote. Min\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Max in the table are values present in the sample. For the full possible ranges of the scales, neighborhood disadvantage ranges from 0 to 15, education/income is standardized here (see\u00a0  for more information), economic strain ranges from 1 (low strain) to 4 (high strain) and area deprivation ranges from 1 (most advantaged compared to rest of the USA) to 100 (least advantaged compared to rest of the USA). \n    \nMean comparisons of study variables for Hispanic/Latine, White and Black youth \n  \nNote. Groups with different superscripts within the same row indicate statistically significant differences at   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. \n  \n\n### fMRI results \n  \nResults from regression models examining the main effect of neighborhood and the interaction of neighborhood\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0race on brain activation are displayed in\u00a0 . Notably, all analyses controlled for SES. For the full-sample main effect of neighborhood model (see\u00a0 ), activation in the left insula was associated with neighborhood disadvantage in the threat condition, such that individuals from more disadvantaged neighborhoods showed greater activity the left insula when anticipating threat. There was no significant association between neighborhood disadvantage and neural responses to reward anticipation. Significant differences in the association between neighborhood disadvantage and brain activation were found between youth from minoritized racial/ethnic backgrounds and White youth, for both social threat and reward anticipation. For descriptive purposes, we extracted parameter estimates of signal intensity from each cluster that correlated with neighborhood disadvantage and plotted the effects for each comparison. \n  \nNeural regions showing differential associations with neighborhood disadvantage between racial groups for threat and reward anticipation \n  \nNote.

Using a social incentive delay fMRI task, we found that across the whole sample, greater neighborhood disadvantage related to higher left insula activation when anticipating social threats; there was no association for social rewards. We further found that Black and Latine youth showed different associations between neighborhood disadvantage and neural responses to social threats and rewards compared to White youth. This study offers important contributions to research as the first study to demonstrate differences in the association between neighborhood disadvantage and neural function between racial/ethnic groups, suggesting that previous findings may not be universal among all adolescents. Rather, racialized experiences, both systemic and interpersonal, may play an important role in how the neighborhood environment becomes embedded in the developing brain. \n\nIn making these cross-race comparisons, it is important to note that we view race/ethnicity as a proxy for different social experiences based on one\u2019s racial/ethnic background in a society that minoritizes Black and Latine youth and treats White youth as the dominant racial group. Furthermore, we purposefully refrain from treating any one group\u2019s neural activation as normative or labeling them in terms of positive/negative or adaptive/maladaptive or conjecturing about how these findings may relate to other outcomes. Our findings should not be considered in terms of \u2018hyper-vigilance\u2019 or \u2018increased social cognition\u2019 toward social threats and rewards, but simply as what they are\u2014one form of vigilance or cognition, as shaped by experiences within an environment. We believe these differences are due to differences in lived experience, not innate to groups or individuals. Thus, our discussion rather focuses on the possible experiences that might contribute to these different patterns. It is important to note that, consistent with patterns across the USA, the White youth in this study lived in more advantaged neighborhoods on average than Black and Latine youth. Thus, the question of whether youth of different racial backgrounds have different experiences within the same neighborhood environment that shape neural activation cannot be fully captured here, because many are not living in the same environments. Thus, we exercise caution when interpreting these results and urge others to do so as well. Nevertheless, this study is among the first to consider the interactions between marginalization and broader developmental context on neural responses to negative and positive social stimuli. \n\n### Race, ethnicity and social experiences \n  \nThus far, we have framed our discussion of race/ethnicity in this paper around racialized social experiences. We do this to speak openly against racial essentialism, but we also feel it important to expand and clarify the language we use to make sense of these findings, particularly regarding race and ethnicity. Race is a socially constructed system of power in which a dominant group is privileged over other groups, whereas ethnicity typically refers to cultural beliefs and practices within a group. Yet both are frequently used to broadly describe social and psychological experiences of a group, and over time, the lines between how to define race and ethnicity have become blurry not just for researchers describing people (see  ), but also, and perhaps more importantly, for how people describe themselves ( ). \n\nFor example, White/Caucasian and Black/African American are considered racial categories, whereas Hispanic/Latine is considered an ethnicity and is often asked as a separate question in many surveys. It is important to remember, however, that many racial and ethnic labels originated as social constructs in the USA for use in the census, but in and of themselves have little meaning in describing the characteristics of groups or individuals. The distinction between race and ethnicity is particularly unclear and at times even confusing for people from Hispanic/Latine backgrounds. According to the Pew Research Center, approximately two-thirds of Latines say that being Hispanic/Latine is a part of both their ethnic and racial identity ( ;  ). When asked their race in surveys and on the census, approximately one-third left the provided racial categories blank, often selecting \u2018Other\u2019 and typing in responses such as \u2018Mexican\u2019 or \u2018Latin-American\u2019 ( ;  ). This was also the case in the current study, in which 20 of the 59 Hispanic/Latine participants did not select one of the racial categories provided by the researchers (which did not include Hispanic/Latine as a racial category) and instead provided their own text responses related to their Hispanic/Latine origin as their race. \n\nTherefore, we feel it important to clarify that within all three groups in this study\u2014White, Black and Latine adolescents\u2014there are both systemic (i.e. race-based) and cultural (i.e. ethnic) processes that interact with the neighborhood environment to help explain our findings. Thus, one aspect of our discussion centers on systemic racial experiences (e.g. discrimination, inequitable educational opportunities, housing policies, etc.) and how people might respond and adapt to unjust racialized environments. The second aspect centers on cultural values and practices that also shape social experiences, recognizing the agency and intentionality that people use to organize and define themselves and their communities. Thus, when we speak of differences across racial groups, we recognize the strengths and intentionality of marginalized groups and seek to describe them as far more than their being marginalized by US society. \n\n\n### Social threat processing \n  \nWe found that for social threat anticipation, neighborhood disadvantage was associated with greater activation in the left insula across the whole sample. This region was found in one other related study that examined the influence of neighborhood on neural processing of physical threat ( ) and is often associated with salience detection ( ;  ). However, despite our whole-brain exploratory approach, this was the only significant brain region found to be associated with neighborhood disadvantage in the current study, whereas previous studies have found multiple brain regions. The lack of clear main effects of neighborhood disadvantage on neural activity could be due to the racial heterogeneity in our sample, which we explored by examining differences in this association across racial/ethnic groups. When anticipating social threats, we found that minoritized youth showed greater brain activation in the insula, putamen, amygdala, ACC, IFG, temporal poles and pSTS compared to White youth\u2014regions that relate to salience detection ( ;  ;  ;  ) and mentalizing processes. Although there were some overlapping regions between Black and Latine youth (e.g. ACC), Black youth showed stronger associations between neighborhood disadvantage and activity in salience regions, whereas Latine youth showed stronger associations within mentalizing regions (  vs   White youth). \n\nBoth Black and Latine youth showed an association between neighborhood disadvantage and heightened activation in the ACC when anticipating social threat, relative to their White peers. The ACC is involved in processing experiences of social exclusion ( ) and salience detection ( ). This could mean that for minoritized youth in disadvantaged neighborhoods, anticipation of social threat may elicit similar brain activation as experiences of social exclusion and these youth may process social threats as more salient and personally relevant. Again, we do not view this in terms of positive or negative, but rather a possible response to systemic racialized experiences within the neighborhood context. For example, minoritized youth face systemic social limitations and interpersonal experiences of discrimination, which may resemble a sense of exclusion and foster a sense of threat awareness that may not be present or could be different in youth who have not had these experiences. \n\nRelative to White youth, Black youth show associations between neighborhood disadvantage and heightened activation in regions of the brain that process the salience of stimuli, including the insula, putamen, amygdala, ACC and IFG. This is consistent with previous research that found associations between neighborhood disadvantage and activity in salience regions in children and adults, particularly the dACC, insula, putamen and amygdala ( ;  ;  ). However, findings from our study are the first to show that this trend was particularly pronounced for Black (compared to White) youth. Disadvantaged environments, particularly those with more immediate threats to safety, may foster an increased awareness of negative and threatening aspects of the social world ( ;  ;  ), perhaps through repeated exposure to an unsafe and insecure environment. Our findings suggest that this is may be further exacerbated by racialized experiences within that environment, as many Black adolescents experience overt discrimination and become more aware of systemic inequities facing their and other groups ( ;  ;  ). Furthermore, largely in response to a hostile racial environment, many African American parents talk openly with their adolescents about facing bias and exercising caution and wariness in interracial situations ( ;  ). Again, these responses may very well be normative responses to certain experiences, but nonetheless may help explain these findings regarding social threat processing for Black youth. \n\nAlthough some previous research has shown that individual-level socioeconomic disadvantage relates to activation in regions of the brain often associated with mentalizing ( ), we demonstrate here that neighborhood disadvantage was also associated with neural responses in social cognition/mentalizing-related regions, including the temporal poles and pSTS, among Latine youth relative to White youth. Disadvantaged environments are known to foster a sense of interdependence and greater awareness of others\u2019 emotional states ( ;  ;  ;  ). This may be especially true for Latine youth who experience an added layer of disadvantage within their neighborhood context. Cultural practices and values emphasizing interdependence, familism and being more other-oriented are also more common in Latine than Black and White families ( ), and thus, when facing a limiting and threatening neighborhood environment, Latine youth may be more likely to engage in other-oriented thinking, such as mentalizing about others\u2019 emotional states to assess potential threats. Furthermore, connections to their other-oriented culture help promote prosocial behavior and self-esteem and protect against the effects of discrimination among Latine youth ( ;  ). Thus, the neural responses to social threat observed in this study sensitivity do not reflect a deficit or hypersensitivity and perhaps actually reflects a more prosocial response compared to others. It will be important for future research to study the role of specific cultural values, such as interdependent thinking, in shaping the influence of neighborhood environments on brain function. \n\n\n### Social reward processing \n  \nThis study also offers important insights into our understanding of how neighborhood environments are associated with social reward processing. Past research has shown an association between neighborhood context and neural activation in the ventral striatum to monetary rewards, with higher neighborhood disadvantage associated with greater activation in this region adults ( ) and lower activation in children ( ). Contrary to these findings, when analyzing the full sample, we found no significant associations between neighborhood disadvantage and neural activation toward social rewards. These differences may be due to a number of differences between the present study and past work in this area, including that we used social rather than monetary reward cues, our sample had a higher proportion of low SES participants and our sample consisted of adolescents. However, when we tested the interaction of neighborhood disadvantage and race, we found significant differences in neural activation between Black and White youth. Specifically, greater neighborhood disadvantage related to greater activation in the insula, putamen, amygdala, IFG, ventral striatum, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and TPJ for Black youth only. These regions are known to be involved in salience detection (i.e. insula, putamen, amygdala and IFG), reward processing (ventral striatum), mentalizing (i.e. TPJ) and cognitive control (dlPFC). \n\nAgain, we posit that there are likely racialized systemic and cultural experiences that contribute to these differences. Disadvantaged neighborhoods generally lack rewarding social experiences due to a lack of resources (e.g. social cohesion, parks and green spaces) and the presence of violence, threats and an uncontrollable environment ( ;  ). For Black youth in this study, these disadvantaged environments were associated with heightened brain activation in regions involved in reward processing and salience detection. In part, this may be a form of strength and resilience in the face of an environment with limited social rewards ( ;  ), that these youth are more responsive to positive social experiences when they do experience them. \n\nThere are also several important cultural processes that might influence Black youths\u2019 sensitivity to social rewards. African American parents frequently seek to instill values in their children that are inherently social and positive, such as fostering a sense of cultural pride, developing positive personal and cultural identities, gaining social intelligence, being oriented toward fairness and social justice and finding strength in community support ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). These values relate to many aspects of positive youth development in African American youth, including prosocial behavior, community engagement and stronger social connection ( ;  ). Taken together, these social cultural values in African American families may help explain why we found greater neural responses to social rewards in reward and salience regions of the brain in African American youth, although future research is needed to directly test the specific cultural and psychological processes that may give rise to this enhanced sensitivity to rewards. \n\n\n### Strengths, limitations and future directions \n  \nTaken together, results from this study suggest that the neighborhood context interacts with racialized experiences to shape neural sensitivity to social threats and rewards among adolescents. One major strength of this study is that it utilized a large and diverse sample of US adolescents, which allows for more generalizability of findings on adolescent brain development in the USA. Compared to previous studies, this sample includes youth from both low and high SES and diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, capturing a wider range of experiences related to socioeconomic disadvantage. This is also one of the first studies to examine the interaction of neighborhood disadvantage and race, showing that youth from minoritized backgrounds are more strongly influenced by their social environment, likely because race adds an additional layer of how the environment is experienced. Importantly, these comparisons are made difficult by the fact that White youth lived in more advantaged neighborhoods on average compared to Black and Latine youth, and thus it cannot be fully concluded that White youth would not show similar activation if in that neighborhood context. Although these comparisons across racial/ethnic groups make an important contribution, there was also heterogeneity in neighborhood disadvantage, SES and brain activation within racial/ethnic groups. Other factors not assessed in this study may also shape how race is experienced, particularly for Latine youth, such as bilingualism, immigration status and skin tone (i.e.\u00a0presenting as White, Black or Indigenous). Future research should examine differences within groups as well as across. \n\nFurthermore, although we offer several possible explanations of our findings based on current research, these findings show a need for future research to examine specific mechanisms that underlie these differences, including systemic factors (e.g. segregation, access to nutritious food and lack of green spaces), social factors (e.g. discrimination and critical awareness) and cultural factors (e.g. interdependent values and racial attitudes and beliefs) that might play a role in minoritized adolescents\u2019 lives. Finally, this sample was from a rural region of the USA, whereas most research has been conducted in suburban or urban areas. Although we view this novel perspective as a strength, it is also possible that the disadvantage operates differently in rural and urban settings, and future research should aim to investigate these different settings. \n\nAlthough we offer some initial evidence for the specific role of neighborhood context, the cross-sectional nature of the study limits conclusions about developmental trajectories or causal pathways. Thus, although neighborhood disadvantage is associated with neural threat and reward processing during adolescence, there is much yet to be learned about specific developmental timing and change over time from childhood through adolescence. Prior work in adults has shown that disadvantage during childhood and adolescence is more important for brain function than during adulthood ( ;  ;  ). This suggests that a change in one\u2019s social environment later in life does not exert a strong influence on brain function, but rather the patterns established earlier in life remain. Although we are unable to examine changes in neighborhood environment in the current study, future research should use longitudinal approaches to understand how different aspects of the social environment play a role at specific developmental periods and how changes in environment may relate to social threat and reward processing. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, this study makes a number of meaningful contributions to our current understanding of neighborhood disadvantage, race and the developing brain. This study utilized a large and diverse sample of US adolescents and a novel approach to understanding the intersection of neighborhood disadvantage and race, making it more generalizable for understanding influences on adolescent brain development. Neighborhood disadvantage was related to greater neural activation in salience and mentalizing regions of the brain toward social threats for Black and Latine adolescents and to greater activation in reward, salience and mentalizing brain regions toward social rewards for Black adolescents. Together, this study shows that race and racialized experiences are important for understanding how social environments shape neural sensitivity to social threats and rewards. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9949505, "text_md5": "af40c30bc472016b0bc6176b9b9d28f5", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 134], "journal": [135, 159], "publication_year": [161, 165], "title": [176, 286], "keywords": [300, 371], "abstract": [384, 2008], "body": [2017, 50505]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 36178870, "doi": "10.1093/scan/nsac053", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9949505", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9949505"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9949505\">9949505</a>", "list_title": "PMC9949505  Neighborhood disadvantage, race/ethnicity and neural sensitivity to social threat and reward among adolescents"}

Recently, it has also been shown that weight loss interventions might affect fMRI food cue reactivity and that there is a close association between the alteration of cue reactivity and the outcome of the intervention. Here we tested whether fMRI food cue reactivity could be used as a marker of diet-induced early changes of neural processing in the striatum that are predictive of the outcome of the weight loss intervention. To this end we investigated the relationship between food cue reactivity in the striatum measured one month after the onset of the weight loss program and weight changes obtained at the end of the six-month intervention. We observed a significant correlation between BMI change measured after six months and early alterations of fMRI food cue reactivity in the striatum, including the bilateral putamen, right pallidum, and left caudate. Our findings provide evidence for diet-induced early alterations of fMRI food cue reactivity in the striatum that can predict the outcome of the weight loss intervention. \n   Highlights  \n  \nfMRI food cue reactivity is associated with a six-month weight loss intervention outcome. \n  \nMore weight loss is associated with lower fMRI response preference for high- vs. low-calorie food images in the striatum. \n  \nFood cue reactivity alterations in the striatum during the first month predict BMI changes at the end of the intervention. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nObesity is a growing public health concern worldwide. In children and adolescents, the prevalence of obesity increased between 1975 and 2016 from 0.7% to 5.6% in girls and from 0.9% to 7.8% in boys ( ). In adults, the prevalence of obesity increased between 1975 and 2014 from 3.2% to 10.8% in women and from 6.4% to 14.9% in men ( ). Overweight and obesity are associated with a number of negative cognitive and health outcomes, including increased risk for heart disease ( ), cancer ( ), depression ( ), and premature mortality ( ). \n\nIn developed countries, as a result of practically unrestricted access to high-calorie food, energy intake is controlled primarily by the hedonic aspects of food consumption rather than by the metabolic needs ( ;  ). Because of this, recently obesity research has become focused more strongly on hedonic eating and the underlying dysregulation of the brain reward system ( ;  ). One of the most successful fields of research that emerged in this context is concerned with the brain processes that mediate increased susceptibility to obesogenic environmental cues (such as images of calorie-rich food) and thus lead to overeating and inability to maintain healthy weight ( ;  ;  ;  ). Therefore, searching for reliable neural markers of brain processes underlying altered motivational saliency of food cues in obesity has become an important objective. \n\nNeuroimaging has been extensively applied in research on the brain processes associated with obesity risk and responsiveness to weight loss interventions. For example, several studies have examined gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes as predictors of responsiveness to weight control interventions ( ;  ). In addition to structural imaging, functional MRI (fMRI) has been used extensively to examine brain activation differences between obese/overweight individuals and those with normal weight. Obesity is related to altered resting-state functional connectivity (e.g.,  ) and associated with alterations in fMRI responses to both food intake and visual food cues ( ). Furthermore, fMRI activation and functional connectivity might also predict the outcome of weight loss interventions ( ). \n\nImportantly, neuroimaging has provided converging evidence for altered fMRI responses as well as resting-state functional connectivity of brain reward system in obesity ( ;  ;  ;  ). In particular, investigation of fMRI responses to high- vs. low-calorie foods has been especially successful and has shown that food cue reactivity is increased in obese as compared to lean participants in brain areas implicated in reward computation and value-based action selection, such as ventral and dorsal striatum, insula, and the orbitofrontal cortex as well as in the frontoparietal network of brain areas involved in inhibitory control ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). It has also been shown that initial food cue reactivity in these brain regions measured by fMRI can predict subsequent body weight trajectory and weight loss intervention outcome ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Furthermore, recently it has also been revealed that alteration of food cue reactivity in the reward system, especially in the dorsal striatum is closely associated with both body weight trajectory as well as the efficacy of the weight loss intervention and could also predict long-term ability to maintain weight loss in a follow-up period ( ;  ;  ). These results are in agreement with the food addiction model of obesity ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ), according to which obesity overlaps with addiction in terms of neurobiological alterations in the striatum leading to food craving and persistence of unhealthy food intake habits. \n\nTaken together, these results suggest that alteration of food cue reactivity in the striatum might serve as an fMRI marker of weight loss intervention efficacy. Furthermore, based on previous findings ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) showing that initial weight loss\u2014observed during the first 1\u20132\u202fmonth of the intervention\u2014might be closely associated with the weight loss program outcome, it is tempting to hypothesize that alterations in the striatum's fMRI food cue reactivity might take place already at the early stage of the intervention and could be used to predict its outcome. Here we addressed this possibility by investigating the relationship between food cue reactivity in the striatum measured one month after the onset of a weight loss program and weight changes obtained by the end of the six-month intervention. Our prospective neuroimaging study reveals that the difference in the fMRI responses to high- and low-calorie food images in the striatum\u2014including the bilateral putamen, right pallidum, and left caudate\u2014after one month of the weight loss intervention shows a close association with the changes in the participants' body mass index at the end of the six-month weight loss program. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA total of 68 obese outpatients (58 female and 10 male) from the Metabolism Centre of Szent Imre Hospital (Budapest, Hungary) were recruited to participate in the study organized and sponsored by   Plc. (Budapest, Hungary). Inclusion criteria were: age of 18\u201365\u202fyears, body mass index (BMI)\u202f>\u202f30\u202fkg/m  and three-month weight stability (<5% body weight change) immediately prior to the study. In the case of two participants, BMI scores decreased slightly below 30\u202fkg/m  (29.44 and 29.92\u202fkg/m ) during the time period between testing for inclusion criteria and the first baseline measurements. Major criteria for exclusion were body weight exceeding 130\u202fkg, pregnancy, smoking, excess alcohol consumption, drug addiction within 1\u202fyear before the study, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, psychiatric disorders, claustrophobia, vision problems, metal implants, history of bariatric surgery, or conditions causing obesity, e.g., hypothyroidism. Out of 68 participants enrolled, only 31 (27 female and 4 male) completed the study with full dataset. The reasons for the high drop-out rate were the lack of compensation, low compliance with the diet/lifestyle changes and the relatively high time requirement of the visits. After image quality control, two additional participants had to be excluded due to the residual effect of motion artifacts on fMRI data after movement correction, leaving a total of 29 participants for data analysis. \n\nThe study was organized and conducted according to Hungarian regulations and laws and approved by the Hungarian Medical Research Council. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the study. \n\n\n### Study design \n  \nParticipants were recommended to consume a low-calorie diet (1500\u202fkcal/day) during the six-month-long intervention period. No specific exercise program was recommended. Dietary intervention involved the investigation of the patients' motivations, mapping the potential obstacles of weight loss, counseling about low calorie dieting, keeping a food diary, and encouragement for performing a voluntary intake restriction of approximately \u2212500\u202fkcal (to reach ~1500\u202fkcal/day). Participants were asked to complete food diaries about full consumption three days per week (two workdays and a weekend day)\u2014including the exact names of the foods; type and specifications (sugar and lipid content, etc.); place of consumption (at home, cantina, restaurant, etc.) and mode of preparation (raw, boiled, fried, etc.); size (a complete guideline was supplied to the participants). Patients were also asked to write down the thoughts and feelings about keeping the diary and how it influenced their eating habits. Major divergences from the daily habits (e.g., festivals, parties, and holidays) were also expected to be mentioned. In later visits, experiences and difficulties were addressed, and further dietary and exercise counseling was given on a personal basis. \n\nParticipants visited the hospital at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 during the intervention period for check-ups. At each scheduled visit, participants arrived at the hospital in fasted state, then underwent an evaluation of anthropometric parameters (body weight, height, and waist circumference). On the first, third (4\u202fweeks), and last (24\u202fweeks) visits, body composition was also measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA; Lunar Prodigy Advance, GE Healthcare, Madison, WI, USA). For the first and third visits, participants stayed at the hospital overnight. On the second day of these visits, fMRI measurements were carried out 2\u20135\u202fh after subjects consumed standard lunch at the hospital. \n\n\n### fMRI protocol \n  \nParticipants were scheduled for two separate fMRI imaging sessions, one before starting the six-month weight loss intervention (  baseline, Session 1  ) and another at the end of the first month of the six-month weight loss intervention (  Session 2  ). Both imaging sessions included four ~6\u202fmin long experimental and two 10\u202fmin long resting-state runs as first and last runs. During the experimental runs images of neutral objects, high-calorie foods, and low-calorie foods were presented in a block design format. Each run consisted of four randomly presented 21\u202fs long blocks for each image category in which 7 individual images were presented for 2\u202fs followed by a 1\u202fs gap. Each block was separated by 9\u202fs and each run began with 15\u202fs of blank screen with only a fixation cross present. \n\nA total of 112 pictures for each image category were collected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) database ( ) and Internet search engines. In the two sessions, the same 112 images were randomly presented in four runs of 28 images for each image category. High-calorie food images contained an equal number of sweet and savory food images. All images were equated for luminance and contrast and presented centrally, subtending 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u00b0, on a uniform gray background. Stimuli were projected onto a translucent screen located at the back of the scanner bore using a Panasonic PT-D3500E DLP projector (Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd., Kadoma, Osaka, Japan) at a refresh rate of 60\u202fHz, and they were viewed through a mirror attached to the head coil at a viewing distance of 57\u202fcm. Head motion was minimized using foam padding. Stimulus presentation was controlled by MATLAB R2010a (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) using PTB-3 ( ;  ;  ). Participants were instructed to pay attention to the images presented on the screen. \n\nIn order to control for attention to images during scanning, participants completed an old/new memory task outside the scanner following each session. During the task, 20 images for each image category were randomly presented for participants who had to decide whether the given image was seen (old) or not seen (new) in the scanner. Half of the images were a subset of those presented in the scanner, and the other half were novel. \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nMRI data were collected on a 3 Tesla Philips Achieva MRI scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) equipped with an 8-channel SENSE head coil. High-resolution anatomical images were acquired for each subject using a T1-weighted 3D TFE sequence (repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)/flip angle (FA)\u202f=\u202f9.77\u202fms/4.60\u202fms/8\u00b0; field of view (FOV)\u202f=\u202f240\u202f\u00d7\u202f240\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u202fmm ) yielding images with 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202fmm  resolution. Functional images were collected with an ascending acquisition order covering the whole brain with a BOLD-sensitive T2*-weighted 2.00-fold-accelerated SENSE-EPI sequence (36 slices, 3.25\u202fmm slice thickness with 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202fmm  in-plane resolution; TR/TE/FA\u202f=\u202f2000\u202fms/30\u202fms/90\u00b0). \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nPreprocessing and analysis of the imaging data were performed using the SPM12 toolbox (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) as well as custom-made scripts running on MATLAB R2015a. The functional images were spatially realigned to the first EPI image within a run for motion correction. All realigned functional images were coregistered with the 3D anatomical image which was then segmented and normalized to the MNI-152 space (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fmm ) using the unified segmentation-normalization tool of SPM12. To spatially normalize functional images to MNI-152 space, we applied the deformation field parameters that were obtained during the normalization of the 3D anatomical image. After the normalization procedure, functional images were spatially smoothed with an 8-mm full-width at half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel. \n\nTo calculate individual beta maps, we used a standard voxel-wise General Linear Model (GLM), with three regressors for neutral object, high-calorie food, and low-calorie food images as boxcar functions convolved with a hemodynamic response function (HRF;  ) and applied a temporal high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1/128\u202fHz. Movement-related variance was accounted for by the spatial parameters resulting from the motion correction procedure. To calculate individual food cue reactivity maps, we contrasted the estimated beta weights of regressors for high- and low-calorie food images, serving as input for the second-level analyses. \n\n\n### Regression analysis \n  \nTo investigate the relationship between food cue reactivity and BMI change following the six-month intervention, we performed a second-level voxel-wise linear regression analysis with the six-month BMI change as a covariate of interest on individual food cue reactivity maps measured at baseline vs. at the end of the first month of the six-month intervention (  Session 2  \u202f\u2212\u202f  Session 1)  . In order to control for the interindividual differences in age, we included the participants' age as a nuisance covariate in the regression model. We focused our analysis on the striatal regions implicated in weight loss ( ;  ;  ) using anatomically defined masks of the left and right accumbens, caudate, putamen, and pallidum based on the Harvard-Oxford Atlas ( ). The union of these binary masks was taken and dilated by one voxel (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fmm ) in all directions to yield the striatum mask in which voxel-wise regression analyses were conducted. The resulting statistical t maps were small volume corrected for multiple comparisons using a two-tailed voxel-level False Discovery Rate (FDR) at q\u202f=\u202f0.05. For visualization, statistical maps with FDR corrected   p  \u202f<\u202f.05 threshold were projected onto axial anatomical image slices averaged across participants using an in-house modified version of xjView 9.6 toolbox ( ). Stereotaxic coordinates are reported in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and regional labels were derived from the AAL2 atlas ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Correlation analysis \n  \nWhen testing associations across anthropometric measurements (BMI, BFP, age), we used the Robust Correlation Toolbox ( ) in MATLAB R2015a. Robust correlation methods have been shown to provide better estimates of the true association with high power and accurate false positive control by down-weighting or removing outliers and accounting for them in significance testing. Skipped Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated where bivariate outliers were detected using an adjusted box-plot rule and removed in the computation of skipped correlations. The number of outliers (NO) detected and removed is reported for each correlation. For correlation coefficients (r), 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated based on 1000 samples with the percentile bootstrap method implemented in the toolbox. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Weight change and behavioral assessments \n  \nThe experiments presented in this study were successfully completed by 29 obese adults (26 women, mean age\u202f\u00b1\u202fSD: 47.59\u202f\u00b1\u202f12.64, min/max age: 21/66) with average (\u00b1SD) initial body mass index (BMI) of 36.88 (\u00b1 5.50)\u202fkg/m  ( .). Importantly, despite the fact that there was a large interindividual variability in participants' age, the baseline BMI scores were not correlated with the participants' age (skipped Pearson r(27)\u202f=\u202f\u22120.03,   p  \u202f=\u202f.868, CI\u202f=\u202f[\u22120.38 0.28], NO\u202f=\u202f0).   \nScatter plot of participants' age (y-axis) and BMI scores (x-axis) at baseline. Blue circles represent individual data points. In boxplots along the x- and y-axes, the \u201ccentral box\u201d represents the interquartile range (IQR) with lower and upper boundary lines at the 25th and 75th percentile of the data, respectively. Whiskers indicate the full range, the red central line indicates the median of the data. Triangles depict the 95% confidence interval of the median value (  median  \u202f\u00b1\u202f1.57\u202f\u00d7\u202f  IQR  /  n  ). \n  Fig. 1   \n\nWe found that participants had significant weight loss following the six-month weight loss intervention: relative to their initial magnitude, BMI scores were significantly reduced after the six-month intervention (t(28)\u202f=\u202f\u22122.57,   p  \u202f=\u202f.016). Importantly, there were no correlations between BMI scores at baseline and their reduction after the six-month weight loss intervention (r(26)\u202f=\u202f0.03,   p  \u202f=\u202f.449, CI\u202f=\u202f[\u22120.24 0.33], NO\u202f=\u202f1), suggesting that diet-induced body mass reduction did not depend on the initial body mass index. \n\nAfter the first month of the six-month intervention there was also a significant reduction in BMI (t(28)\u202f=\u202f\u22125.18,   p  \u202f=\u202f1.69\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 ) which did not differ significantly in magnitude from the six-month BMI reduction (t(28)\u202f=\u202f0.89,   p  \u202f=\u202f.379). The between-subject variance, however, was significantly higher for the six-month relative to the one-month BMI change (F(28,28)\u202f=\u202f7.43,   p  \u202f=\u202f4.77\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 ) indicating that individual differences in weight loss were more pronounced after the six-month intervention ( ). In addition, individual differences in six-month BMI change were predicted by one-month BMI changes, since there was a significant positive correlation between one-month and six-month BMI changes (r(26)\u202f=\u202f0.73,   p  \u202f=\u202f5.95\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 , CI\u202f=\u202f[0.55 0.85], NO\u202f=\u202f1).   \nDistributions of participants' weight change (\u2206BMI) at the end of the first (1 mo) and last month (6 mo) of the six-month weight loss intervention. Median weight change did not differ significantly between sessions at the 5% significance level, however, interindividual variability at 6\u202fmonths was larger, as shown by the larger interquartile range (IQR). Blue circles represent individual data points jittered to prevent overlap. In each boxplot the \u201ccentral box\u201d represents the IQR with lower and upper boundary lines at the 25th and 75th percentile of the data, respectively. Whiskers indicate the non-outlier range (1.5\u202f\u00d7\u202fIQR), the red central line indicates the median of the data. Triangles depict the 95% confidence interval of the median value (  median  \u202f\u00b1\u202f1.57\u202f\u00d7\u202f  IQR  /  n  ). \n  Fig. 2   \n\nIn order to control for attention to food images during scanning, participants performed an old/new recognition memory task outside the scanner. Data of four participants were missing due to technical difficulties. Participants did in fact attend to the food images, as evidenced by high average accuracy rates of 75.60\u202f\u00b1\u202f2% (mean percent correct \u00b1 SEM) in this task. There were no differences in memory performance scores (d-prime) across food images (main effect of food cue: t(24)\u202f=\u202f\u22120.58,   p  \u202f=\u202f.567) and sessions (main effect of session: t(24)\u202f=\u202f0.25,   p  \u202f=\u202f.804). The non-significant interaction of food cue and session (t(24)\u202f=\u202f\u22120.88,   p  \u202f=\u202f.388) suggests that memory performance was similar for the high- and low-calorie food images in the two sessions. \n\n\n### Brain regions showing elevated fMRI responses to high-calorie food images \n  \nFirst, we performed a whole brain analysis to confirm that our experimental approach was successful in activating brain areas that were shown to respond more strongly to high-calorie food images as compared to low-calorie ones. In agreement with previous results ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) our analysis revealed significantly larger fMRI responses to high-calorie food images, i.e. significant food cue reactivity in several regions of the striatum, frontal, orbitofrontal, and visual cortex (  p  \u202f<\u202f.05, two-tailed FDR whole brain corrected at voxel level) (see  ).   \nBrain regions showing increased fMRI responses to high- vs. low-calorie food images. \n  Table 1     \n\n\n### Effect of weight loss intervention on the fMRI responses in the striatum \n  \nOur analysis was focused on testing whether food cue reactivity in striatum measured after only 30\u202fdays of a six-month weight loss intervention could predict the outcome of the weight loss program. Neural (i.e. fMRI) responses to high- vs. low-calorie food images were measured at baseline (  Session 1  ) and 30\u202fdays after the onset of the intervention (  Session 2  ) in the striatum and regressed on BMI change following the six-month intervention. BMI change was calculated by subtracting baseline BMI from BMI measured at the end of the six-month intervention. \n\nRandom-effects regression analysis (p\u202f<\u202f.05, two-tailed FDR small volume corrected at voxel level) of the fMRI data obtained at the end of the first month of the six-month intervention (  Session 2  ) revealed the close association of fMRI responses in the dorsal and ventral regions of the bilateral putamen, as well as in the right pallidum and caudate with the six-month BMI change (see   and  ): the higher the magnitude of the fMRI responses to high- relative to low-calorie food images in these regions at the end of the first month, the more positive the BMI score change (i.e. less weight loss) at the end of the last month of the six-month intervention.   \nStriatal regions (left dorsal putamen (z\u202f=\u202f10\u202fmm), right pallidum and dorsal putamen (z\u202f=\u202f2\u202fmm), bilateral ventral putamen and right caudate (z\u202f=\u202f\u22126\u202fmm)) showing positive relationship between fMRI responses to high- vs. low-calorie food images measured after one month and BMI loss at the end of the intervention. Color bar represents t values (df\u202f=\u202f26). Statistical maps are displayed with   p  \u202f<\u202f.05, two-tailed FDR small volume corrected at voxel level on axial slices of a mean structural image from all participants. MNI z-coordinates in mm are indicated in the upper left corner of each slice. \n  Fig. 3     \nStriatal regions showing associations between fMRI responses to high- vs. low-calorie food images measured after one month and BMI loss at the end of the intervention. \n  Table 2     \n\nNext, we tested whether the observed relationship between food cue reactivity measured in the striatum 30\u202fdays after diet onset and BMI changes at the end of the six-month intervention is mediated by the diet-induced alteration of striatal responses. To this end, we performed a linear regression analysis for estimating the relationship between the six-month BMI loss and the difference of fMRI responses to high- vs. low-calorie food images between   Session 2   and   Session 1  . There was a close association between the diet-induced change of fMRI response modulation and BMI loss primarily in the posterior part of the dorsal and ventral putamen, as well as in the right pallidum, and left caudate (see   and  ): the lower the fMRI response preference for high- compared to low-calorie food images in these regions at the end of the first month of the six-month intervention relative to baseline, the more negative the BMI score change (i.e. more weight loss) at the end of the last month of the six-month intervention.   \nStriatal regions (bilateral dorsal putamen (z\u202f=\u202f6\u202fmm), right pallidum and dorsal putamen (z\u202f=\u202f0\u202fmm), bilateral ventral putamen and left caudate (z\u202f=\u202f\u22126\u202fmm)) showing positive relationship between diet-induced alterations in fMRI responses to high- vs. low-calorie food images from baseline to one month and BMI loss at the end of the intervention. Color bar represents t values (df\u202f=\u202f26). Statistical maps are displayed with p\u202f<\u202f.05, two-tailed FDR small volume corrected at voxel level on axial slices of a mean structural image from all participants. MNI z-coordinates in mm are indicated in the upper left corner of each slice. \n  Fig. 4     \nStriatal regions showing associations between diet-induced alterations in fMRI responses to high- vs. low-calorie food images from baseline to one month and BMI loss at the end of the intervention. \n  Table 3     \n\nAlthough, previous research has also shown an association between the initial food cue reactivity in the striatum and the efficacy of the weight loss program ( ), our analysis failed to reveal a significant relationship between fMRI responses to high- vs. low-calorie food images measured at baseline (  Session 1  ) and BMI change after the six-month intervention using a two-tailed FDR corrected threshold of   p  \u202f<\u202f.05. \n\nIn addition to BMI, body fat percentage (BFP) ( ) is also a commonly used measure of overweight and obesity as well as weight status during weight loss intervention ( ). Consistent with previous results showing a close association between BMI and BFP ( ), in our study there was a significant correlation between the diet-induced BMI and BFP loss after the six-month intervention (skipped Pearson r(26)\u202f=\u202f0.76,   p  \u202f=\u202f2.04\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 , CI\u202f=\u202f[0.55 0.89], NO\u202f=\u202f1) leading to similar relationship between fMRI responses to high- vs. low-calorie food images and BFP loss as observed in the case of BMI. In the left (t(26)\u202f=\u202f4.62; x, y, z\u202f=\u202f\u221218, 2, 10 and t(26)\u202f=\u202f4.30; x, y, z\u202f=\u202f\u221226, \u221212, 4) and right (t(26)\u202f=\u202f4.87; x, y, z\u202f=\u202f30, \u22122, 4) dorsal putamen food cue dependent modulation of fMRI responses at the end of the first month of the diet was positively associated with BFP loss following the six-month intervention (p\u202f<\u202f.05, two-tailed FDR small volume corrected at voxel level). The relationship of diet-induced alterations in putamen food cue reactivity (  Session 2  \u202f\u2212\u202f  Session 1  ) with six-month BFP loss, however, was only revealed when using an uncorrected threshold of   p  \u202f<\u202f.001.Taken together, these results revealed that diet-induced alteration of food cue reactivity in the bilateral putamen, right pallidum, and left caudate of obese participants measured 30\u202fdays after the onset of a six-month weight loss program can predict the magnitude of BMI changes at the end of the intervention. Importantly, these results were not confounded by the interindividual variability in age, since participants' age was included as a nuisance covariate in all regression analyses. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe examined the relationship between early weight loss intervention effects on food cue reactivity in the striatum and participants' BMI in a six-month prospective study. Participants' food cue reactivity was measured at baseline by means of fMRI and again after one month participating in a weight loss program. BMI was tracked in all participants a total of six months after beginning the intervention. In agreement with previous findings ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) we found that weight loss during the first month can predict the outcome of the intervention. Importantly, the fMRI results revealed that after just one month in the weight loss intervention there were alterations in neural reactivity to food cues in the brain's reward network that showed a close association with BMI loss after six months in the program. In particular, we found that the change in food cue reactivity in the bilateral putamen, right pallidum, and left caudate between baseline and just one month in the weight loss program predicted BMI change after six months. These findings are in line with previous research showing that initial food cue reactivity in striatum measured by fMRI can predict subsequent body weight trajectory and weight loss intervention outcome ( ;  ;  ;  ). Furthermore, recently it has also been revealed that alteration of food cue reactivity in the reward system, especially in the dorsal striatum is closely associated with both body weight trajectory as well as the efficacy of the weight loss intervention and could also predict long-term ability to maintain weight loss in a follow-up period ( ;  ;  ). \n\nOur results revealed a close association between weight loss and diet-induced modulation of food cue reactivity in several regions of the striatum, including the bilateral putamen, right pallidum, and left caudate. Although the specific role of the different striatal regions remains to be explored, it is the putamen that has been implicated in food-cue related reward processing most consistently in previous studies. In a meta-analysis of fMRI findings,   found that overweight/obese individuals had altered putamen responses relative to healthy-weight individuals for both high-calorie food cues, but also for general reward processing. This altered processing is also present in individuals with an obesity risk allele for the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene ( ) and in adolescents at risk for obesity ( ). Furthermore, increased food cue reactivity in the putamen has been shown to correlate with weight gain ( ) while decreased reactivity has been shown to correlate with subsequent weight decreases ( ). Changes in putamen activation likely do not reflect changes in BMI or weight per se, as they were observed after a 12-week intervention but predicted weight change at a 9-month delay ( ). Finally, it appears that putamen responses to food cue reward potential may be modulated by context. For example,   found that the putamen responded to visual food cues (both high- and low-calorie foods) but that the level of activation depended on time of day (with greater activation in the morning than the evening). Our results are in line with these previous findings and provide further evidence that diet-induced alterations of neural processes within the putamen\u2014as reflected in changes of food cue reactivity\u2014are closely associated with weight loss and might be used as an fMRI marker of intervention efficacy. \n\nPrevious neuroimaging studies investigating the relationship between neural food cue reactivity and weight loss have examined changes over longer time periods than that used here (e.g., 12\u202fweeks,  ). An important novel aspect of the current findings is that we revealed a close association between fMRI food cue reactivity changes in the putamen over the first month of the diet and the weight loss at the end of the six-months intervention. These findings are in agreement with previous studies in which alterations in putamen food cue reactivity has been identified in other weight control interventions such as gastric bypass surgery ( ), or behavioral interventions ( ), suggesting that it might serve as a robust marker of intervention effectiveness. \n\nAccording to a recent study providing precise functional maps of regional specialization within the human striatum ( ), the posterior part of the dorsal putamen where food cue reactivity alterations predicted weight loss in the current study might be primarily associated with somatosensory processing including taste and might be implicated in habits processing. This is compatible with the food addiction model of the obesity, which proposes that obesity overlaps with addiction in terms of neurobiological alterations in the dorsal striatum leading to dominance of habit-based control of eating behavior ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ). \n\nBased on previous findings ( ;  ;  ;  ) one could have expected an association also between the baseline fMRI food cue reactivity and intervention outcome. However, there might be several explanations for the lack of significant correlation between these measures in the current study. First, most previous studies finding an association between baseline food cue reactivity and weight loss contrasted fMRI responses to (high-calorie) food images with responses to non-food control images ( ;  ) or simply used brain responses to food images ( ). In contrast, in the current study we compared high- and low-calorie food images in order to isolate food-reward-related neural processes selectively. Second, it is also important to note that most of these studies ( ;  ;  ) used baseline food cue reactivity to predict spontaneous weight change, not treatment-related weight change, as in our study. Third, in many cases, the strongest association between food cue reactivity and weight loss was found in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens in particular,  ;  ) which brain region is strongly affected by susceptibility artifacts and thus would require application of specially designed scanning protocols, which was not feasible in the current study. Further, our population was very heterogeneous in physical and also motivational terms, which is typical in general clinical practice. This might also explain why diet-induced alterations in food cue reactivity, rather than its baseline values, were found to be associated with the intervention outcome. This issue is further complicated by recent findings showing that the presence of DRD2 TaqIA A1 allele significantly moderates the relation between baseline food cue reactivity and weight loss ( ). \n\nOur findings suggest a new direction in neuroimaging research of obesity focusing on diet-induced early alterations in brain processes that are predictive of weight loss intervention outcome. Strong additional support for such an approach has been provided by a recent study showing that change in fMRI food cue reactivity within the fronto-parietal network underlying self-control of food intake during the first month of the intervention is closely associated with successful weight loss as well as subsequent weight maintenance ( ). The converging evidence provided by the   and the current study for the utility of diet-induced early (1-month) alterations of brain fMRI food cue reactivity in prediction of weight loss intervention outcome is especially notable, considering that there were substantial differences in the experimental design between the two studies, including the weight loss intervention protocol and measurement of food cue reactivity (high-calorie vs. non-food images and high-calorie vs. low-calorie food images in the   and present study, respectively). Taken together, these findings hold great potential from a translational neuroscience perspective, by suggesting ways by which the process of target identification for weight loss intervention could be shortened and made more efficient. \n\nIn this study, there are potential limitations which should be acknowledged. Although the relatively small number of participants tested in this study is common for neuroimaging research on obesity, it could limit the statistical power and generalizability of our findings. Furthermore, given the large interindividual variability in our obese sample, age and baseline body weight might be potential confounding factors affecting our findings. The heterogeneous sample we investigated in this study, however, was more reflective of the general population, not limiting the scope of these results to a specific group. It is important to note, however, that we did not find any correlations between age, baseline BMI, and BMI loss. In addition, to control for the age-related changes in fMRI activity, we used the participants' age as a nuisance covariate in all regression analyses. Another limitation is the lack of a control group. Further studies are justified, and could include larger cohorts, a control group, monitoring of daily food intake and activity. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur findings provide evidence that the efficacy of weight loss intervention can be predicted one month after its onset based on the alteration of fMRI food cue reactivity in the striatum, including the bilateral putamen, right pallidum, and left caudate. \n\n\n## Conflict of interest \n  \nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6463125, "text_md5": "54c83889b621b7dfa6dbd77b4e8e4329", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 207], "journal": [208, 223], "publication_year": [225, 229], "title": [240, 364], "keywords": [378, 441], "abstract": [454, 2098], "body": [2107, 37736]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 30991304, "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101803", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6463125", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6463125"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6463125\">6463125</a>", "list_title": "PMC6463125  Efficacy of weight loss intervention can be predicted based on early alterations of fMRI food cue reactivity in the striatum"}

This is especially true in team sports such as the most popular one worldwide: soccer. We investigated reward processing upon scoring a soccer goal in a standard two-versus-one situation and in comparison to winning in a monetary incentive task. The results show a strong overlap in brain activity between the two conditions in established reward regions of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, including the ventral striatum and ventromedial pre-frontal cortex. The three main components of reward-associated learning i.e. reward probability (RP), reward reception (RR) and reward prediction errors (RPE) showed highly similar activation in both con-texts, with only the RR and RPE components displaying overlapping reward activity. Passing and shooting behavior did not correlate with individual egoism scores, but we observe a positive correlation be-tween egoism and activity in the left middle frontal gyrus upon scoring after a pass versus a direct shot. Our findings suggest that rewards in the context of soccer and monetary incentives are based on similar neural processes. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSeen as a driving force of human behavior and decision making, reward has previously been described as an operational concept for the positive value animals, including humans, ascribe to a behavioral act, object, or internal physical state [ ]. While a lot of previous research has been dedicated to processing of primary rewards such as food, liquid, and sexual stimuli [ \u2013 ], secondary rewards of monetary and social nature are also very important motivators for human behavior [ \u2013 ]. Only two studies compared monetary and social reward processing in the form of positive social feedback and good reputation [ ,  ]. In these studies, reward-related areas, i.e. the ventral striatum (VS) as well as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), showed overlapping brain activity in response to monetary and social rewards [ ,  ]. Results of these studies concurred with social exchange theory [ ], which states that in social interactions not only materialistic goods such as money, but also non-materialistic goods such as social help are traded for other social goods as e.g. improved reputation. \n\nThree major components are important in reward processing and reward-based learning: the probability, i.e. expectation of reward size and magnitude, the actual reward reception, and their difference: the reward prediction error [ ,  ]. Previous studies comparing reward processing in a social and monetary context failed to investigate these different components in an active decision-making paradigm. We therefore developed a paradigm which allowed disentangling these different components in a social sport context by using reward in the form of goal-scoring in the most popular sport worldwide: soccer, which is played by about 265 million people around the globe (FIFA Communications Division (2007)\u2014FIFA Big Count 2006: 270 million people active in football). \n\nOur paradigm presents standard two-versus-one (2v1) situations in front of a goal in which subjects decide to either shoot to the goal directly or pass the ball to a team mate. By varying the situations and having them pre-rated by soccer experts, we manipulated the perceived probabilities of scoring the goal. The participant has a choice between a socially modest choice (pass) and a socially self-serving choice (shoot). The choice to pass to a teammate implies a more social, possibly team-oriented decision, while the decision to directly aim at the goal may add a personal on top of the social benefit. This is explained by pointing out that scoring a goal directly has an additional benefit to the goal scorer: while the team benefits from the goal, the scorer\u2019s social reputation increases as well by directly becoming the focus point for celebration and social approval. This emphasizes that the decision to either pass or shoot is not solely influenced by the perceived probability of scoring the goal\u2014but also by personality factors such as egoism, that determine whether social (prosocial) or personal (proself) benefits will be given greater weighting. \n\nTwo types of egoism have been previously identified: a hostile and derogatory kind, as well as a narcissistic and self-enhancement kind [ ]. The Dutch Personality Questionnaire (DPQ) and Supernumerary Personality Inventory (SPI) egoism tests measure these two different kinds of egoism, which have been shown to converge on the Honesty-Humility (HH) scale of the HEXACO Personality Inventory\u2014Revised (PI-R) [ ]. The abbreviation HEXACO stands for the six dimensions of the PI-R: \u201cHonesty Humility\u201d, \u201cEmotionality\u201d, \u201ceXtraversion\u201d, \u201cAgreeableness\u201d, \u201cConscientiousness\u201d, and \u201cOpenness to Experience\u201d, with the test being freely accessible online (hexaco.org). It is based on the Five Factor Model and it is the HH scale which has been established as a sixth dimension which lies beyond \u201cthe Big Five\u201d [ ]. Specifically, the HH assesses egoism on a behavioral dimension ranging from sincere, modest, and fair (when scoring low) to insincere, greedy, and boastful (when scoring high) [ \u2013 ]. It might therefore be ideally suited to assess the personality trait egoism in the context of the present research question. Another well-established measure to explain social behavior by distinguishing between prosocial and proself orientations is the social value orientation (SVO) questionnaire [ ]. Using this questionnaire, previous studies were able to identify a correlation between it and the HH scale of the HEXACO PI-R [ ]. \n\nBy means of an active decision making soccer paradigm and a well-established monetary incentive task, we examined overlapping brain activation during monetary and soccer-specific social reward processing, including reward probability, reward reception and reward prediction errors. Additionally, we hypothesize egoism to correlate with stronger reward related signals upon scoring a goal after a direct shot versus after a pass to a teammate. On the behavioral level we expect to find more egoistic players to shoot the ball significantly more than to pass it. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Pre-testing \n  \nPre-testing stimuli for the soccer paradigm were created by taking screenshots (1400x1050 pixels, 4:3 format, window mode, rendering quality: high, MSAA option: off, frame rate: no limit) of 200 different 2v1 situations from the soccer simulation FIFA 13 (Electronic Arts Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA). Screenshots displayed standardized 2v1 situations involving two attacking players with ball possession and a defending goalkeeper from the opposing team (  and  ). Pre-testing was performed using the online survey tool Qualtrics (Provo, UT, USA). For each image, participants were asked three randomly presented questions: \n  \nHow likely is it that you shoot the ball yourself, rather than passing it to your teammate, in order to score? \n  \nHow likely is it for you to score upon shooting the ball? \n  \nHow likely is it for your teammate to score after having received a pass? \n     Soccer situations.  \nSix exemplary images of the different soccer situations presented in the soccer paradigm. The player in ball possession approaches the goal from either the left or the right side of the penalty spot. A. Clear situation (pass). B. Clear situation (shoot). C. Unclear situation. \n  \n377 German soccer players rated the situations. These soccer players were recruited by distributing the Qualtrics online link via Email to all of the 262 German regional soccer associations, while the Berlin and Hamburg soccer clubs were written to individually. Only teams and officials from the Middle Rhine soccer association were not contacted to keep this pool of participants for the fMRI part of the experiment. Furthermore, the link was posted online in local soccer blogs and social platforms. Each situation was rated an average of 38.63 (\u00b1 3.44) times. Question one ratings were used to categorize the situations into the 40 most unclear and 20 clearest situations (10 for shot and pass, respectively) and question two and three ratings were used to determine the scoring probabilities. \n\n\n### Soccer Paradigm \n  \nThe fMRI paradigm was programmed using in-house software. Upon being confronted with the situation, participants decided to either pass or shoot the ball via button press ( ). Each situation was randomly shown twice and half of the feedbacks were preset to be positive (GOAL!) and the other half negative (MISS!), thus leading to 60 goals and 60 misses, respectively. The stimuli had an interstimulus interval (ISI) and intertrial interval (ITI) of 3000\u20136000 ms programmed for randomization using the \u201crandint\u201d function of Python 2.7 (Python Software Foundation, Beaverton, OR, USA). The feedbacks were preset in reference to the ratings of pre-testing questions two and three, thus making the feedback as realistic as possible. \n   The soccer and monetary paradigm.  \nTimeline for an exemplary trial out of the 120 trials shown in the soccer paradigm and the 150 trials shown in the monetary paradigm. \n  \n\n### Monetary Paradigm \n  \nIn the previously published monetary incentive paradigm [ ,  ], participants guessed under which out of one to four randomly shown boxes a circle was hidden, leading to winning probabilities ranging from 25% to 100% ( ). In each of the 150 trials, a correct guess led to a positive monetary feedback (win) of 10 euro cents and a wrong guess to no monetary win (no win), while no guess led to a monetary loss of 10 euro cents. The ISI and ITI were also programmed for a randomization of 1500\u20134500 ms using Python 2.7. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \n33 male (age: 24.39 \u00b1 3.20 years) participants were recruited from local soccer teams via internet advertisements, flyers, word of mouth, and personal recruitment sessions at local soccer clubs. Exclusion criteria were a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, involvement in the online pre-testing questionnaire, as well as conditions prohibiting the participation in an MRI setting. Additionally, participants had to be right-footed and actively playing at a soccer club. The participants received a show-up fee of 10 euro as well as additional monetary compensation depending on the results of the monetary paradigm and the monetary incentivized SVO test. All participants gave written informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki (BMJ 1991; 302; 1194) and the experiment was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Bonn. \n\n\n### Experimental Procedure \n  \n#### Personality Questionnaires \n  \nEach participant handed in the completed personality questionnaires (HEXACO PI-R 200 and SVO, previously distributed) at the scanning appointment. Additionally, a questionnaire regarding personal data and soccer experience was filled out by the participants on site ( ). They subsequently received detailed instructions about the experimental procedure as well as ethical and medical implications. As part of an oral briefing procedure taking place directly ahead of entering the scanning room, each subject was instructed to not view the scenes as being from a video game, but rather as real-life situations with the teammate and opposing goalkeeper possessing real-life flaws. \n\n\n#### fMRI Experiment \n  \nIn total the experiment took two hours, consisting of three parts: a psychological questionnaire (~30 minutes), scanning preparation (~30 minutes), and scanning session (max. 90 minutes). The scanning session consisted of the soccer paradigm (max. 34 minutes), monetary paradigm (max. 32 minutes) and the final structural T1 measurement (~9 minutes). Participants were scanned on a 1.5 T Avanto Scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Instructions were given regarding the emergency ball, the use of OHROPAX Classic ear protection (OHROPAX GmbH, Wehrheim, Germany), and the correct button pressing via the respective response grips (Nordic NeuroLab, Bergen, Norway). An 8-channel head coil was placed above the participant\u2019s face and video goggles (Nordic NeuroLab, Bergen, Norway) used to present the stimuli were installed on the head coil. Each paradigm was presented using Presentation v14.9 (NeuroBehavioural Systems Inc., Albany, CA, USA). Following the scanning sessions, participants were debriefed with regard to the preset soccer feedbacks and the study objective concerning egoism. \n\n\n\n### Imaging Protocol \n  \nAcquisition of the functional data was done using EPI-sequences with a repetition time (TR) of 2.5 s, echo time (TE) of 45 ms, and a flip angle of 90 degrees. The image resolution was 64 x 64 pixels and the field of view 192 x 192 mm. 31 slices covering the brain from the superior part of the cerebellum to the top of the cerebrum including the midbrain were obtained in an axial fashion and an interslice gap of 0.3 mm. This resulted in a voxel size of 3 x 3 x 3.3 mm. \n\n\n### fMRI Analyses \n  \nData sets of five participants were excluded due to one participant not fully understanding the monetary paradigm, one scanning session being cancelled because of technical problems, one participant having a metal plate inside his knee, and data sets of two participants showing excess head motion (translational: >3 mm, rotational: >2.5 degrees). Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK) was used to analyze the data sets of the remaining 28 participants (age: 24.57 \u00b1 3.21 years). \n\nPre-processing steps included slice time correction, motion correction, spatial normalization to the T1 image of each participant, reslicing to a 3 x 3 x 3 mm voxel size, and a final smoothing step using a Gaussian kernel with full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 8 mm. Creating an identical GLM for both paradigms was technically not possible due to the necessity of combining the positive and negative feedback as well as the combined parametrically modulated (via the reward prediction error (RPE)) feedback in one regressor each. Therefore, brain activation was estimated using a total of four general linear models (GLM): two soccer and two monetary GLMs with GLM-specific regressor combinations. \n\nGLM1 (soccer paradigm): \n  \n1. Choice \n  \n2. Choice (parametrically modulated via reward probability (RP)) \n  \n3. Positive feedback (goal) after a pass \n  \n4. Positive feedback (goal) after a shot \n  \n5. Negative feedback (miss) \n  \n6. Missed response \n  \n7.-12.: Movement regressors \n  \nGLM2 (monetary paradigm): \n  \n1. Choice \n  \n2. Choice (parametrically modulated via RP) \n  \n3. Positive feedback (win) \n  \n4. Negative feedback (no win) \n  \n5. Missed response \n  \n6.-11.: Movement regressors \n  \nGLM3 (soccer paradigm) and GLM4 (monetary paradigm): \n  \n1. Choice \n  \n2. Feedback \n  \n3. Feedback (parametrically modulated via reward prediction error (RPE)) \n  \n4. Missed response \n  \n5.-10.: Movement regressors \n  \nThe RP parameter in the soccer paradigm was calculated based on the scoring probabilities assessed in the pretest; the reward probabilities in the monetary paradigm were directly related to the number of boxes shown in each trial (i.e. 0.25, 0.33, 0.5 or 1). The RPE parameter was computed as the difference between the outcome (i.e. 1 or 0) and the given RP. All of the regressors were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) as implemented in SPM8. First-level contrasts were then established for each of the four GLMs and used for the second-level random effects analyses (p<0.001, uncorrected). These included one sample t-tests for the \u2018\u2018RP versus zero\u2019 (one for each paradigm), \u2018goal versus miss\u2019/\u2019win versus no win\u2019 (reward reception), \u2018goal after a shot versus goal after a pass\u2019, \u2018goal after a pass versus goal after a shot\u2019, as well as \u2018RPE versus zero\u2019 (one for each paradigm) contrasts. A whole brain search was performed for each contrast and activities were listed accordingly (  and   Tables). The coordinates and T values of the peak voxels were determined in SPM8 and the relevant regions were then resolved using the automatic anatomic labeling (aal) atlas [ ], as implemented in the xjView toolbox (available via  ). By using this atlas, brain regions were inspected individually and labeled according to the terms used in the literature. The exact procedural description and an abbreviation overview can be found in the supplementary information ( ). All of the beta and contrast images for each of the 28 subjects are freely accessible via the Harvard Dataverse Network website at \u201c \u201d. \n\nThe differential activation was statistically compared using the second-level specification feature of SPM8. For this purpose, each of the three specific reward contrast images (RP versus 0, RR, and RPE versus 0) were compared via paired t-tests. After subsequent estimation, the contrasts of soccer versus monetary reward activity were compared on a whole-brain level (k >10, df = 27,  ). \n\nThe egoism analysis was performed by using the egoism values from the Honesty-Humility scale of the HEXACO 200 PI-R as covariates in the contrasts \u201cscoring after a shot versus a pass\u201d and \u201cscoring after a pass versus scoring after a shot\u201d. Additionally, behavioral egoism values were calculated by taking the proportion of shots in the clear situations normalized by the number of total shots and integrating them as covariates in the same contrasts described above. All behavioral data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). \n\n\n### ROI Analyses \n  \nIn line with a previous study investigating overlapping brain activation [ ], regions of interest (ROI) masks were created from the monetary reward contrasts \u2018RP versus 0\u2019, \u2018win versus no win\u2019, and \u2018RPE versus 0\u2019 using the xjView toolbox (p<0,001, k>10,   (yellow color)). More details of the regions included in the monetary ROI masks and the results of the whole brain search for each of paradigms can be found in the supporting information (  and  , as well as  ). The monetary masks were then applied to the respective soccer brain activation contrasts (p<0.001, k>10, relevant masks can be seen in   (red color) and  ).The results were small volume corrected (p<0.05, familywise error (FWE)-corrected) and checked for significantly overlapping active regions ( ). Additionally, four ROI masks were obtained from the authors of the previously published paper involving the monetary paradigm [ ]. These were based on the Oxford-Harvard cortical and subcortical atlases and included the bilateral ventral striatum, the ventral midbrain, and the medial orbitofrontal cortex. These ROI masks were however only used to check for the independent activation robustness of the monetary paradigm and are considered irrelevant for the main part of the analysis. \n   Masks of the reward processing regions activated in each and both paradigms (k > 10, df = 27).  \nA.

The HEXACO PI-R 200 was analyzed on each domain and facet-level scale ( ), resulting in only four participants being categorized as egoistic. Using the data from the SVO questionnaire, 21 prosocials, five proselfs, and no competitors were identified (mean = 1.19, SD = 0.40), while two were not classified due to inconsistent responses. Only one participant was characterized as egoistic and proself. Subsequent analysis using the SVO scores was refrained from due to lack of statistical power. \n\n\n### Behavioral Results \n  \nBehavioral data from the soccer paradigm was grouped into four categories. For each of the clear and unclear categories, pass and shoot choices were analyzed ( ). Out of the 3360 situations, only five situations were not responded to. Overall, soccer players did not decide to shoot significantly more or less than to pass the ball ( ). In order to identify individual soccer players that chose to either shoot or pass more than others, one SD above/below the average ratio was used as a threshold. This resulted in five participants having chosen to shoot directly significantly more than the rest. \n\n\n### fMRI Results \n  \n#### Reward Probability \n  \nOverlap analysis using inclusive masking revealed overlapping brain activity modulated by reward probability in the bilateral temporal parietal junction (TPJ), bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and right postcentral gyrus (POG) (  and  , green color). No differential activation was observed. \n\n\n#### Reward Reception \n  \nThe very medial posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), bilateral ventral striatum (VS), left dlPFC, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and left vmPFC were all found to be significantly active in both types of reward reception (  and  , green color). The vmPFC activation was found to extend into the subgenual and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC and rACC, respectively), as well as into the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). Only scoring a goal versus missing led to additional significant brain activity ( ). This was found in the bilateral TPJ, as well as in areas of the left vlPFC. \n\n\n#### Reward Prediction Error \n  \nOverlapping activation during reward prediction error processing was observed in the bilateral VS (  and  , green color) and no differential activation was observed. \n\n\n#### Correlation to Egoism \n  \nContrasting scoring a goal after a shot versus a pass and vice versa led to no significant activation. Furthermore, the behavioral egoism covariate analyses did not show significant brain activation. No correlating brain activation was observed between egoism scores (Honesty-Humility scale of the HEXACO PI-R 200) and brain activation due to \u201cscoring after a shot versus scoring after a pass\u201d. However, a negative correlation was found between the Honesty-Humility scale of the HEXACO PI-R 200 and brain activation (i.e. positive correlation of egoism) upon \u201cscoring after a pass versus scoring after a shot\u201d (  and  ) in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG; p(FWE-corr.) = 0.002;   and  ). \n   Positive correlational activity between egoism and scoring after a pass versus a shot at the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG, k >10, df = 27).  \nThe negative correlation of brain activity and Honesty-Humility depicts a positive correlation with egoism.

B. left MFG (green circle) activation in correlation to egoism upon scoring after a pass versus a shot. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nUsing the combination of a standard monetary incentive and a newly developed soccer-related task, we were able to investigate different computational aspects in reward-based learning in a soccer-specific social in comparison to a monetary context, i.e. reward probability, reward reception, and reward prediction errors. Our data does not only show a strong overlap of the neural substrates involved in monetary and soccer-specific social feedback in different aspects of reward processing, but also differential activation during reward reception. \n\n### Reward Probability \n  \nThe bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), temporal parietal junction (TPJ), and right postcentral gyrus (POG) were shown to be active during anticipation of both reward types. The dlPFC has been associated with social judgment and decision making, specifically in relation to behavioral control of social strategic behavior [ ], implementation of fairness-related behavior [ ], and social norm compliance [ ,  ]. The TPJ has been shown to be involved in spatial working memory tasks [ ] as well as social contexts such as apology and forgiveness [ ], as well as attention and social cognition [ ,  ]. Additionally, right POG activation was observed during the reward anticipation in both paradigms, a region that has identified as the primary somatosensory cortex [ ]. \n\n\n### Reward Reception \n  \nThe ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), bilateral ventral striatum (VS), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), as well as the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) were involved in reward reception in both paradigms. The largest cluster peaking in the vmPFC and extending into the subgenual and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC and rACC, respectively), and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), as well as the activation of the VS have been associated with social and monetary reward processing in other previously mentioned studies comparing social and monetary reward [ ,  ]. Besides the ventral parts of the striatum having long been known to be part of the reward circuit [ \u2013 ], the sgACC and rACC could have played a role in the attention circuit regulating cognitive and emotional processing [ ,  ]. This is also relevant in pointing out that similar activation in these two regions was observed in another soccer reward processing study that contrasted goal and miss, as well as goal versus open play [ ]. To our knowledge this is the first study showing evidence for a direct overlap in the vmPFC and VS with respect to monetary and soccer-specific social rewards, even though other studies have shown involvement in social reward processing as well [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. The PCC has been previously shown to be linked to value association in connection with reward processing [ ], as well as episodic memory retrieval [ ], and visuospatial attention [ ,  ]. It is therefore difficult to interpret the exact role in our paradigm. Specifically, activations of the left dlPFC have been linked to behavioral control of strategic social behavior [ ] and attention control during task preparation [ ], while left vlPFC activation has been related to cognitive control of current relevant memory [ ], and selection between competing active representations as used in goal-selection [ ,  ]. \n\nThe direct comparison of reward-related activity in both tasks revealed more activation in the soccer as compared to the monetary paradigm. Of these, the TPJ has been associated with spatial working memory tasks [ ], suggesting a stronger involvement possibly occurring due to expertise of the soccer players with these standard situations and therefore implicit spatial memory retrieval. Additionally, the TPJ has been associated with social contexts, such as social cognition in relevance to attention [ ], apology and forgiveness [ ], and parochial punishment [ ]. The differential activation of the TPJ only existing in relevance to the soccer paradigm could therefore be suggested to represent the sport\u2019s implicit social context as shown in the form of 2v1 situations. Additionally, activation only found upon scoring a goal was also located in the left vlPFC. As mentioned before, this region is especially activated during cognitive control of current relevant memory [ ] and selection between competing active representations as used in goal selection [ ,  ]. It can henceforth be suggested that processing these features of the soccer situations require greater neural effort than simpler guessing situations such as shown in the monetary paradigm. It is important to note however that such a suggestion can only be finalized following a same study procedure involving \u201cnon-experts\u201d. \n\n\n### Reward Prediction Error \n  \nThe bilateral VS was significantly activated during reward prediction error processing in the soccer game as well as in the monetary domain. It is well known for its role in reward prediction error processing [ ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ], but this is the first time a sport-related context has been shown to elicit this type of activity. \n\n\n### Egoism \n  \nThe whole HEXACO test was handed out to the participants to prevent the soccer players from recognizing the egoism component of the study and thus influencing the decision making process of the individuals. This was especially important since egoism is known to be associated with negative personal features such as antisocial behavior [ ]. Even though no correlation between egoism and brain activation upon scoring a goal after an own shot and scoring after a pass was observed, we did find a positive correlation between egoism and activation in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in response to scoring a goal after a pass versus after a shot. This region has been linked to many different higher cognitive processes such as image recognition [ ], spatial working memory tasks [ ], emotional processing of happiness [ ], reasoning [ ], as well as future event construction and elaboration [ ], but has not been shown to be involved in reward processing, specifically. This rather counterintuitive finding might be explained by suggesting that more egoistic soccer players do not require any neural effort to process scoring a goal after a shot since these individuals value this as a rather normal situation, while scoring after passing the ball to a teammate requires self-reflective spatial and reasoning neural effort in regions such as the MFG. By not finding significant activation in the previously mentioned reward areas, our data does not support the hypothesis of egoism correlating with stronger reward related signals upon scoring a goal after a direct shot versus after a pass to a teammate. Additionally, our behavioral observations do not show a correlation between passing and shooting behavior in 2v1 situations in front of goal and egoism. These results can be seen as a first step towards dealing with individuals in team sports who thus far have been labeled by the public and media as \u2018egoistic\u2019. Even though we did not find any correlation between egoism scores and passing versus shooting behavior, it is too far-fetched to suggest the personality trait egoism to not guide the oftentimes labeled selfish decisions on a soccer pitch. Future studies involving other in-game soccer situations (e.g. in the middle of the pitch decisions: \u2018dribble versus pass\u2019) and other team sport decision making paradigms should therefore be done in order to determine the personality and social aspects guiding such behavior. Determining these aspects could be crucial in developing guidelines for coaches and teammates to deal with mistakenly labeled \u2018egoistic\u2019 individuals in social activities such as team sports. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nEven though we think that a soccer-related task such as the one implemented in the experiment has an inherent social context, it is important to point out that there are several possibilities for improving the social aspect of the experimental setup. Since the participant in the scanner does not interact with other participants directly, creating an avatar of the participant and one of his teammates could serve as an idea for a future study. With the participant then lying in the scanner, the teammate could observe the decisions made by the participant from the scanner operating room and respond accordingly, thus giving social feedback, or two players could directly interact in a hyperscanning experiment. As recently published in relation to social feedback processing, another idea would be to implement a camera in the scanner in order to emphasize the social aspect of the soccer-specific social experimental procedure even further [ ]. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur results suggest strong overlapping neural processes underlying reward probability, reward reception, and reward prediction error processing during highly motivating team sport situations and monetary incentives. While reward reception and reward prediction error processes overlap in reward related regions, reward probability processing requires higher cognitive effort in both domains. Besides extending this research to other reward-related sport activities and to different levels of sport expertise, future research could investigate the differences and similarities of reward paradigms in order to decipher the exact processing components of decision making during reward anticipation and probability. Our results furthermore suggest that the role of the term egoism in team sports should be further researched on in order to possibly support the finding of egoism failing to be shown as a driving force of on-pitch soccer behavior. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4398371, "text_md5": "faf4ccb9fc47c82b705db398f40cca07", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 84], "journal": [85, 93], "publication_year": [95, 99], "title": [110, 201], "keywords": [215, 215], "abstract": [228, 1374], "body": [1383, 33387]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 25875594, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0122798", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4398371", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4398371"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4398371\">4398371</a>", "list_title": "PMC4398371  Goal or Gold: Overlapping Reward Processes in Soccer Players upon Scoring and Winning Money"}

A large-scale brain network, referred to as the default mode network (DMN), has been shown to be involved in both mind-wandering and reading, raising the question as to how the same neural system could be implicated in processes with both costs and benefits to narrative comprehension. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to explore whether the intrinsic functional connectivity of the two key midline hubs of the DMN\u2014the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC)\u2014was predictive of individual differences in reading comprehension and task focus recorded outside of the scanner. Worse comprehension was associated with greater functional connectivity between the PCC and a region of the ventral striatum. Better comprehension was associated with greater functional connectivity with a region of the right insula. By contrast reports of increasing task focus were associated with functional connectivity from the aMPFC to clusters in the PCC, the left parietal and temporal cortex, and the cerebellum. Our results suggest that the DMN has both costs (such as poor comprehension) and benefits to reading (such as an on-task focus) because its midline core can couple its activity with other regions to form distinct functional communities that allow seemingly opposing mental states to occur. This flexible coupling allows the DMN to participate in cognitive states that complement the act of reading as well as others that do not. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe development of writing has profoundly changed our social world: it allows ideas to be publicized to geographically diverse groups of individuals and permits concepts to be passed from generation to generation. More prosaically, but no less importantly, reading is a source of enjoyment available to every literate individual. Despite the value of reading, it can often seem that our minds are ill suited to the task of narrative comprehension. It is relatively common during reading, for example, to experience thoughts and feelings that are unrelated to the prose in front of us. Such   task-unrelated thinking   occurs across many task contexts (Smallwood and Schooler,  ) and when it occurs in reading is a well-documented correlate of comprehension problems (Schooler et al.,  ; Smallwood et al.,  ; Franklin et al.,  ; McVay and Kane,  ). At present we lack a detailed appreciation of the processes that govern how our thoughts are constrained to the narrative of a piece of prose, or those that cause our minds to wander away from what we are reading. \n\nThe current study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to investigate whether variations in the experience of reading across individuals have a basis in the brain\u2019s functional architecture. We were particularly interested in how the reading experience of different individuals varied with the behavior of the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), two major midline hubs of the default mode network (DMN; Raichle et al.,  ; Greicius and Menon,  ; Buckner et al.,  ; Andrews-Hanna et al.,  ). The DMN is a constellation of brain regions including regions of prefrontal, parietal and temporal cortex that were initially discovered to \u201cdeactivate\u201d during externally driven tasks, and also exhibit correlated intrinsic neural activity. The DMN consists of a   midline core   that includes the aMPFC and the PCC that can flexibly couple its activity to two additional subsystems: (i) a medial temporal lobe (MTL) subsystem that includes the hippocampus, the medial orbitofrontal cortex, and the temporal poles, and is important in episodic memory; and (ii) a   dorsal   subsystem that includes a dorsal region of the medial prefrontal cortex and lateral regions of the parietal cortex including the temporoparietal junction, and may be important in simulating of self and other (Buckner et al.,  ; Andrews-Hanna et al.,  ). \n\nCurrently the functions of the DMN are a matter of debate: prior studies have documented that the DMN plays a role in task-unrelated thought in sustained attention tasks (Mason et al.,  ; Christoff et al.,  ; Stawarczyk et al.,  ) as well as absent-minded lapses (Eichele et al.,  ; Christoff et al.,  ), suggesting that activity in this network could be responsible for the comprehension deficits that occur when the mind wanders during reading. Given that the DMN is implicated in task-unrelated thinking, it would seem intuitive that this network would be responsible for failures in comprehension that accrue due to mind-wandering. \n\nDespite the appeal of the account of the DMN as the substrate for task-unrelated thought, the picture is likely to be more complicated: regions of the DMN have also been implicated in processes that are likely to be engaged during reading. For example, Fletcher et al. ( ) demonstrated that reading stories containing a narrative relating to either physical reality or to the mental states of other individuals activated the PCC relative to a series of unlinked sentences. Additionally, grey matter volume in the PCC is correlated with an individual\u2019s capacity for phonological decoding (He et al.,  ). Recent meta-analyses have confirmed the role of the PCC and aMPFC in extended narrative comprehension, especially of a fictional nature (Mar,  ). \n\nFunctional studies suggest the DMN is also implicated in processes that readers could use when reading. For example, the DMN is activated when participants make mental state attributions (Spreng et al.,  ; Spreng and Mar,  ), when they retrieve information from memory (Huijbers et al.,  ), and has been hypothesized to allow for multiple different mental states all of which rely on information from memory to guide behavior (Smallwood et al.,  ). Meta-analyses also indicate that elements of the DMN are important in semantic processing: a capacity which is critical for reading (Binder and Desai,  ). Semantic processing, mental state attribution, and the retrieval of information from memory are all abilities that are important in narrative comprehension because they allow the reader to understand the motives of characters and to make links between different elements of an extended text. \n\nTo understand why the DMN could be implicated in both costs and benefits to reading (Smallwood,  ), we recorded how effectively individuals stayed on task while they read three different expository texts from an engaging popular work describing the history of science as well as the lives of the protagonists who contributed to this story. Afterwards participants completed a set of open-ended questions assessing their comprehension of what they read. Previously recorded rs-fMRI data was also available from a subset of these individuals which we used to explore how trait differences in the effectiveness of reading, measured both subjectively and objectively, were related to differences in the intrinsic functional connectivity of two of the major hubs of the DMN (aMPFC and PCC). \n\nBased on prior evidence of DMN activation associated both with processes engaged by reading and with mind-wandering, as well as evidence that mind-wandering during reading is associated with poorer reading performance, we predicted that differences in reading effectiveness would relate to distinct patterns of functional connectivity between the midline core of the DMN and other brain regions. Prior studies have looked at how the behavior of resting state networks associated with reading behavior (Koyama et al.,  ), here we report an rs-fMRI investigation that is focused on the DMN. We used hypothesis driven seed-based analysis to examine whether metrics of reading behavior modulate the whole-brain connectivity of these regions. We were particularly interested in whether any observed modulations of functional connectivity could help shed light on how the DMN can be both beneficial and costly to the act of reading. Although this approach is limited by our choice of seed regions, it does not constrain the results of our analysis and so provides a straightforward, hypothesis driven method to assess our question of interest (Cole et al.,  ). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nHealthy participants were recruited for the current experiment from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences participant database. Ethical approval was obtained prior to completing this experiment from the Ethics committee of the University of Leipzig (Ref # 360-10-13122010). Participants provided written informed consent prior to their participation. \n\n### Assessment of reading behavior \n  \nIndividual differences in maintaining focus on the narrative while reading and subsequent text comprehension was assessed in a sample of 61 healthy native German speakers (age range = 19\u201350, mean = 27.9 years, (SD = 5) 37 females, all right handed) while they read three excerpts from the official translation of Bill Bryson\u2019s   A Short History of Everything,   a text that has been used in English language studies of mind-wandering (Smallwood et al.,  ; Smilek et al.,  ). These texts are engaging non-fiction works that describes the characters and historical contexts of important scientific events. One text dealt with biology, a second with chemistry and a third dealt with geology. On average each text was approximately 1200 words long (mean = 1187). The Fleisch Kincaid levels were calculated using an online website  and ranged from 34\u201339 making these texts slightly easier than university level material. \n\nParticipants read each text on a computer screen in an individual testing booth. Text was presented one sentence at a time and participants received experience sampling probes at random intervals (5\u20137 times for each text). Reading was self-paced and lasted approximately one hour in total. Experience sampling probes asked participants to report whether, at the moment prior to the probe, they were focused on what they were reading or on something else, a phenomenon described as task-unrelated thought (\u201cDachten Sie an die Aufgabe oder an etwas anderes?\u201d). Participants answered this probe using a slider operated via a mouse. At the end of each text participants were asked about their familiarity with the text measured using a similar slider as was used to assess task focus. \n\nAfter each text, comprehension of the material was assessed using a set of open-ended paper and pencil questions. On average participants took approximately 15 (\u00b15) min to read each text and approximately the same time for answer the questions. \n\n\n### MRI Acquisition and Analysis \n  \nrs-fMRI scans of 42 participants (age range = 19\u201326, mean = 27 years, 21 females) were retrieved from the existing Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences participant database. The scans were collected on either a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Tim Trio (  n   = 26) or a Siemens Vario scanner (  n   = 16) before the reading assessment. Scanning duration varied from 360\u2013600 s and two different slice order acquisitions were employed (ascending,   n   = 38, interleaved,   n   = 4). For all participants, the remaining parameters were the same (Repetition Times (TR) = 2000 ms; Echo Time (TE) = 30 ms; flip angle = 90\u00b0; s acquisition matrix = 64 \u00d7 64; Field of view (FOV) = 192 mm; acquisition voxel size = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 mm). Participants were instructed to relax, to hold as still as possible, and to keep their eyes open. High-resolution   T1  -weighted anatomical scans were also acquired for all participants (MPRAGE, TR = 2300 ms; TE = 2.96 ms; TI = 900 ms; flip angle = 9\u00b0; FOV = 256 mm; acquisition voxel size = 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm). \n\n\n### Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \n#### Preprocessing, seed selection, and time series extraction \n  \nCortical surface reconstruction was performed on the T1 scans using FreeSurfer (Dale et al.,  ; Fischl et al.,  ,  ,  ; Behzadi et al.,  ; Reuter et al.,  ). For each subject, nonlinear transformation from T1 to MNI template (created from 152 subjects, resampled at 2 mm, provided with FSL) was calculated using Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs; Avants et al.,  ). \n\nTo remove potential scanner instability effects the first four volumes of each echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence were removed. This was followed by simultaneous slice-timing and motion correction using 4DRealign implemented in nipy  (Roche,  ). Affine transformation from mean EPI image to T1 volume was calculated using BB Register (Greve and Fischl,  ). Brain mask, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mask and white matter (WM) mask were extracted from FreeSurfer parcellation and transformed into EPI space (thresholded at 0.5 after interpolation). Realigned timeseries were masked using the brain mask. Principal components of physiological noise were estimated using the CompCor (Behzadi et al.,  ). Joined WM and CSF masks and voxels of highest variance were used to extract two sets of principal components (a.k.a. aCompCor and tCompCor). Using both of those strategies ensures robust estimation of physiological noise. Outliers in the EPI sequence were discovered based on intensity and motion parameters (ArtDetect).  This was followed by denoising of the time-series using a general linear model (GLM) model with motion parameters, CompCorr components, and outliers as regressors (note that global signal was not regressed). Time-series were also smoothed using SUSAN with 5 mm full width half minimum (FWHM) kernel (Smith,  ). Finally high pass (0.1 Hz) and low pass (0.01 Hz) filters were applied using FSL. Quality of scans and preprocessing was assessed visually by looking at EPI to T1 coregistration overlay, motion parameters plots and temporal signal to noise ratio volumes (tSNR). \n\nTo estimate connectivity from aMPFC and PCC, we selected spherical regions of interest (ROIs) of 6 mm radius with centers at MNI (x, y, z) from left aMPFC = \u22126, 52, \u22122, right aMPFC = 6, 52, \u22122, left PCC = \u22128, \u221256, 26, and right PCC = 8, \u221256, 26. These correspond to the major hubs of the DMN in the left hemisphere as reported by Andrews-Hanna et al. ( ) and we transformed them to the right hemisphere to reflect the fact that the DMN has a complex bilateral structure in normal healthy controls (Swanson et al.,  ). ROI masks were transformed back to each subject\u2019s EPI space using combined inverse nonlinear MNI to T1 transform and affine T1 to EPI (thresholded after interpolation at 0.5). Translated ROIs were restricted within the brain mask. ROIs time-series were estimated by averaging voxels within each ROI. Full brain connectivity (correlation) maps were calculated using analysis of functional neuroimages (AFNI). Connectivity maps were Fisher\u2019s r-to-z transformed and spatially transformed to MNI space for group-level analysis. Finally, these maps were averaged to provide an average connectivity maps for both regions across hemispheres. These averaged maps were used in the subsequent analysis. \n\nPreprocessing was performed with a workflow from Brain Imaging Pipelines  and all data processing integrated using Nipype (Gorgolewski et al.,  ). Code used for generating connectivity maps is available at  . Unthresholded statistical maps have been uploaded to NeuroVault.org and are available at  . \n\n\n#### Analysis strategy \n  \nThe answers to comprehension questions were scored according to an agreed rating system by two independent raters who were blind to the other\u2019s rating and showed high agreement (> 90%). The resulting average scores for each question showed reasonable inter-item agreement (  Cronbachs Alpha   = 0.78). For each participant, an overall comprehension score was computed by averaging the scores obtained across all questions. \n\nFor the behavioral analysis we used a linear mixed model (LMM) as implemented in statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) to examine how the subjective experience while reading was related to the objective measure of comprehension. Building on prior research detailing that poor comprehension can be a marker for task unrelated thought, we predicted the subjective reports of participants based on their comprehension of what they were reading. LMMs allow the comparison of predictors recorded on multiple occasions within different participants in a single model and so allowed us to assess whether variation in task focus within an individual and between different texts is associated with changes in comprehension level. In this analysis the participant was treated as a random effect, the task focus score was the dependent variable and the comprehension of what was read was included as a continuous independent factor. We also included age and gender as fixed factors in this model. We recruited a larger number of subjects for the behavioral element of the study to ensure that the relationships described were as robust as possible. \n\nFor the rs-fMRI analysis, SPM8 was used to perform a second-level random effects analysis of the patterns of connectivity from each ROI. This model included two between-participant regressors for each seed region: (i) reports of subjective focus during reading and (ii) average comprehension of the information read in the text. Scan length was also included in the model as a nuisance regressor. To perform inference we used the topological False Discovery Rate (FDR) approach (Chumbley et al,  ): (1) statistical maps were thresholded at   p   < 0.01 (uncorrected) to define clusters; (2) the probability of the size of each cluster (given the search space, smoothness, and cluster forming threshold) was calculated using Random Field Theory (Worsley et al.,  ); (3) Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to these   p  -values to maintain FDR (of clusters) at 5% level (Chumbley et al,  ). These maps reflect the relationship between subjective and objective measures of reading behavior and the modulations of the intrinsic functional architecture of two key seeds of the DMN. In order to create scatter plots, the beta weights of the peak voxel from the cluster identified by the group-level analysis were calculated for each individual using SPM. To account for the different scanning sequences that our participants had we included three nuisance regressors: scanner type (1 or 0), scanning length in volumes (range 180\u2013300), and slice-timing order scheme (1 or 0). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nComprehension was acceptable for each text (see Figure  ). Prior to analysis, all variables were   z  -transformed. The LMM revealed the expected positive relationship between higher ratings of task related focus when participants read a text when their subsequent comprehension was higher (  F  (1, 171.83) = 4.37,   p   < 0.05,   t  (171.83) = 2.09). This indicates that within participant changes in task focus while reading can be predicted based on whether a participant was successfully able to answer comprehension questions on the material presented during the period when attention was sampled (Smallwood et al.,  ). Neither age nor gender were associated with differences in task focus (all   p  -values < 0.3). We repeated this analysis including a participant\u2019s familiarity with the text, and this did not appreciably alter the main effect of comprehension on task focus (  F  (1, 137.59) = 3.89,   p   = 0.051,   t  (137.59) = 1.97), nor was there an effect of familiarity on ratings of task focus or an interaction with comprehension (for both comparisons   p  -values < 0.3). \n  \n Group level behavioral results  . The group average for the comprehension ranged from .5 to .7 across the three texts, indicating that the measure was not a floor nor at ceiling. This is summarized in Panel   (A)  . LMMs comparing the within participant variation in comprehension and task focus indicated that on texts when comprehension was higher, participants reported better task focus. This is summarized in Panel   (B)   in which the parameter estimates extracted from the LMMs were used to estimate the task focus at one standard deviation above and below the mean. In both panels the error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. \n  \nFor the purpose of the group-level fMRI analysis we calculated individual differences in comprehension for each individual, as well as in the maintenance of task focus on what was read. Boxplot analysis indicated that one individual was an outlier on the measure of task focus, and this score was manually replaced with a score that was adjacent to the next highest score. At the group-level, comprehension and task focus were uncorrelated (  r   = \u22120.06,   p   = 0.667). \n\n\n### Functional imaging results \n  \nThe connectivity patterns of the seed regions used in the current analysis are presented visually in Figure  . These maps are thresholded with a   T  -value of +/\u22123 and provide a visualization of the patterns of connectivity upon which our subsequent analyses are based. Table   presents the results of the group level analyses. \n  \n Group level patterns of connectivity from bilateral seeds from the aMPFC and PCC employed in the current study  . These maps are presented to help visualize the group level patterns of connectivity upon which subsequent analysis are based. Warm colors indicate brain regions exhibiting positive correlations and cold colors indicate regions exhibiting negative correlations. For the purpose of display these maps are thresholded at a   T  -value of +/\u22123. All results are overlaid on a standard MNI template. \n    \n Neural regions whose resting-state functional connectivity with the PCC was modulated by comprehension during reading and the aMPFC by task focus  . \n  \nCluster forming threshold was set at p < 0.01 and significant clusters were determined using topological FDR (q-value < 0.05). \n  \n\n### Comprehension \n  \nA whole brain search of the connectivity of PCC indicated that it was modulated by comprehension. Decreasing comprehension was associated with greater connectivity with a cluster between the PCC and the ventral striatum / amygdala. This can be seen in Figure  . By contrast, as comprehension increased across individuals within our sample we found greater connectivity between the PCC and the right anterior insula (AI). Connectivity with aMPFC did not vary significantly with either better or worse comprehension. \n  \n Modulation of the connectivity pattern of the bilateral PCC by objective indicators of reading performance  . These images were created using a cluster forming threshold of   p   < 0.01. Topological FDR (  q  -value < 0.05) was used to correct for multiple comparisons. The scatter plots reflect the average correlation with the PCC for the peak voxel in each cluster. Each point is a single individual. Co-ordinates reflect the peak voxels for each cluster. All results are overlaid on a standard MNI template. Unthresholded statistical maps have been uploaded to NeuroVault.org and are available at  . \n  \n\n### Task Focus \n  \nWe found that aMPFC connectivity was modulated by better task focus. With increasing task focus, aMPFC exhibited greater connectivity with a region of precuneus/PCC, a cluster in the left parietal cortex, and a third cluster in the temporal cortex. aMPFC connectivity was also higher with two clusters within the cerebellum for individuals who stayed on task. These clusters are presented in Figure  . \n  \n Modulation of the connectivity pattern of the bilateral aMPFC by subjective indicators of reading performance  . These images were created using a cluster forming threshold of   p   < 0.01. Topological FDR (  q  -value < 0.05) was used to correct for multiple comparisons. The scatter plots reflect the average correlation with the aMPFC for the peak voxel in each cluster. Each point is a single individual. Co-ordinates reflect the peak voxels for each cluster. All results are overlaid on a standard MNI template. Unthresholded statistical maps have been uploaded to NeuroVault.org and are available at  . \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur rs-fMRI examination suggests that variations in reading behavior are reflected by relatively complex associations with the connectivity patterns of both PCC and aMPFC. Although the objective (comprehension) and subjective (reports of task focus) indicators were uncorrelated at the group-level, our analysis using a LMM indicated that the measures were sensitive to within participant variance in the constructs measured. This suggests that fluctuations in task focus, and narrative comprehension showed a pattern of common variation within the individuals in our sample. At a group level we found that a more on task focus during reading was associated with greater functional connectivity between the aMPFC and the posterior cingulate and the precuneus, the left angular gyrus and temporal lobe, and the cerebellum. Although this result may seem contradictory with respect to the known role of the DMN in task-unrelated thought (e.g., Mason et al.,  ), this interpretation is consistent with evidence reviewed in the introduction that this network is involved in processes necessary for narrative comprehension, as well as more general evidence that integrity within the DMN is predictive of better rather than worse task performance (Kelly et al.,  ). \n\nObjective variations in performance tracked with variations in connectivity of the PCC seed: as comprehension decreased across individuals we saw greater coupling between PCC and a cluster of subcortical regions including the inferior ventral striatum. By contrast, increasing comprehension was associated with greater coupling between the PCC and the right AI. Subjective descriptions of experience during reading varied with the connectivity of the aMPFC. As task focus increased across participants, the aMPFC showed greater coupling with a region of the posterior cingulate that overlapped with our seed region. This indicates that functional integrity within the midline core of the DMN is higher for people who stay focused during reading. \n\nWe also found evidence that suggests that an on task focus during reading is associated with greater coupling between the DMN and neural regions that support semantic processing. Individuals with higher on task reports exhibited greater connectivity between the aMPFC and a cluster in the left parietal cortex extending into the left angular gyrus and a second cluster that extended ventrally down the left temporal lobe and encompassed the hippocampus. The temporal lobe, especially on the left, is known to play an important role in semantic processes involved in language comprehension (Binder and Desai,  ). Furthermore, grey matter volume is larger in a region of left parietal cortex for individuals who are especially competent at phonological decoding (He et al.,  ). In addition, the dorsal terminus of the cluster we identified in the parietal cortex (\u221245, \u221268, 26) is adjacent to the peak voxel of a region that has recently be found to be commonly activated by semantic tasks, as well as participating in the DMN (\u221248, \u221268, 28) (Seghier et al.,  ; Seghier and Price,  ). If this region can participate in both semantic and DMN processes, it could afford the integration of processes supported by both systems. This could be one reason why we find greater connectivity between the aMPFC and this region with increasing on task reports across individuals: the ability to integrate semantic information with processes supported by the DMN would allow participants to build a richer model of what they are reading which would thus support an attentive focus on what is being read. \n\nComprehension was associated with differences in PCC functional connectivity. We found that better comprehension was associated with greater functional connectivity between the PCC and the right AI. Along with the anterior cingulate, these regions participate in what is known as the saliency network (Seeley et al.,  ). Our observation that individuals who have good comprehension shows heightened coupling between the right AI and the PCC is consistent with the notion that the saliency network plays an important role in coordinating the DMN (Menon and Uddin,  ). For example, individuals with fronto-temporal dementia disease do not recruit the DMN when engaged in moral reasoning, a result that is thought to occur because of a diminished influence of the saliency network on DMN function (Chiong et al.,  ). Similarly, traumatic brain injury disrupts ongoing task performance in a go/no-go task due to a failure to deactivate the DMN, which occurs because of deficits in the integrity of WM tracts linking the hubs of the saliency network (anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and AI). We hypothesize that the heightened coupling between the PCC and the right AI we observe could reflect a signature of an individual who can exert control over the processes served by the DMN which in turn would allow them to maximize their performance on tasks which require this network (such as reading). Interestingly, the right AI has been identified as the entry point of information into the saliency network, a finding which could explain why we find evidence in its connectivity with the PCC (Ham et al.,  ). \n\nBy contrast, worse comprehension was associated with greater coupling between the PCC and a region of the ventral striatum and this region is known to provide strong motivational signals that guide learning and behavior (Liljeholm and O\u2019Doherty,  ) and prior resting-state functional connectivity experiments have shown that this region of inferior ventral striatum shows a pattern of robust connectivity to PCC that more superior areas of the ventral striatum do not (Di Martino et al.,  ). Studies have found that activity in the ventral striatum exhibit reduced deactivation during cognitive tasks when individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are off medication, which is argued to result from motivational problems (Peterson et al.,  ). Individuals with ADHD also tend to show greater educational problems (Kuriyan et al.,  ), as well as greater mind-wandering (Shaw and Giambra,  ). Recent studies have also found increased connectivity between the striatum and the PCC in adolescents with major depression (Gabbay et al.,  ), an observation that is relevant because greater mind-wandering and worse performance on objective measures of performance are correlates of states of dysphoria (Smallwood et al.,  ), negative affect (Smallwood et al.,  ) as well as clinical depression (Watts et al.,  ). Taken together we hypothesize that the pattern of heightened connectivity between PCC and striatum may be a neural signature that signifies problems in external task performance, perhaps due to motivational difficulties in assigning value to an external task (see also Mason et al.,  ). Support for this motivational account comes from experiments that show that performance-related financial reward improves performance and does so by reducing mind-wandering (Mrazek et al.,  ). \n\nOur study found that the intrinsic functional connectivity of the two midline hubs of the DMN, and in particular the PCC, was such that they were capable of producing contrasting cognitive states: our results implicated the PCC in the production of distinctive, often opposing cognitive states (e.g., better and worse comprehension) through its cooperation with spatially distinct regions of the brain. The PCC is part of a highly corrected   rich club   of core nodes (Zuo et al.,  ; Sporns,  ) that are more densely interconnected than would be expected by chance (van den Heuvel and Sporns,  ) and many of the short communication paths within the brain go through one or more of its members (Harriger et al.,  ). These anatomical features would allow a neural region to control the dissemination of a large amount of neural communication (Sporns,  ) and so would explain the PCC\u2019s participation in different neural communities serving oppossing cognitive functions. It is noteworthy that we found that the the PCC either showed greater functional connectivity with the AI or the caudate/putamen depending on the level of a participants reading comprehension: all three of these regions are members of the rich club (van den Heuvel and Sporns,  ). \n\nIn practical terms we demonstrated that rs-fMRI can be used to gain a functional description of the brain organization associated with reading behavior and it could be possible to use this approach in the future to understand attentional problems related to mind-wandering during reading (Smallwood et al.,  ). For example, changing patterns of connectivity between regions of the DMN could provide an additional outcome measure for evaluating interventions that target improving educational achievement in individuals with difficulties in reading. Ultimately, given its sensitivity to individual differences in reading comprehension, rs-fMRI could even provide a method for the diagnosis of the specific functional problems that individuals have with reading problems. \n\nAlthough our results are encouraging, the relatively small sample size (Yarkoni,  ) means that our results must be treated with caution until they are replicated with a larger number of participants. Also, it should be noted that the LMM indicated the expected relationship between objective and subjective indicators of reading comprehension within participants. However, our rs-fMRI analysis is only focused on between participant differences. This prevents us from clearly dissociating the trait of mind-wandering while reading from the state of mind that occurs when our thoughts drift from what we were reading to task-unrelated concerns. To address this issue it would be necessary to acquire fMRI data with while reading is taking place, or at least using multiple sessions of both reading and rs-fMRI data on the same day. Also, it is important to note that we conducted a targeted investigation of the two key hubs of the DMN, and so our study does not provide any information on the behavior of other regions of the DMN or of the resting-state more generally. \n\nIn terms of the implications of our results for understanding the neural basis of reading, we suggest caution when considering the generality of our results. Given the complexity of tasks such as narrative comprehension, we expect that there are likely important boundary conditions on how the DMN contributes to this behavior. For example, it has been shown that this network exhibits greater negative correlation with the left fusiform gyrus for adults who read effectively, as assessed by capacities such as phonological expertise, whereas this relationship is reversed in children (Koyama et al.,  ). These results suggest that experience or age may influence the links between resting-state dynamics and reading abilities. Other studies have shown that patterns of connectivity predicting reading performance occur at multiple spatial scales (Wang et al.,  ), suggesting that the sub-components of large scale networks (such as the DMN) may play different roles during different phases of reading. It is also important to bear in mind that the neural processes engaged during reading can vary dependent on the texts factual or fictional composition (Altmann et al.,  ). Altogether such evidence suggests that for maximum relevance to educational research it would be valuable for future studies to examine the functional architecture that supports differences in reading experience for texts that vary on their narrative characteristics, as well as investigating how dynamics vary with the expertise of the reader. Both of these questions may also benefit from collecting neural data when participants are engaged in the act of reading. While these limitations provide an important caveat on our results, our data is nonetheless an important step in understanding the links between subjective experience and objective indicators of reading experience and their related neural correlates. \n\nFinally, these data provide a plausible answer to the question that motivated this research in the first place:   Why should the DMN be implicated in both costs and benefits to reading?   We found that the mutual connectivity of the midline core of the DMN was such that it produced contrasting cognitive states. The aMPFC exhibited increasing coupling to a region of the PCC (encompassing the seed regions we used in our analysis) more for participants who reported maintaining focus on what they read. The PCC seed was more functionally coupled to the striatum for individuals who performed poorly on tests of comprehension, and more coupled to the AI for those who did well. Based on these data we can rule out simple accounts of the DMN as supporting either task-unrelated thought or successful reading. Instead we propose a novel hypothesis for why narrative comprehension suffers when the mind wanders (Schooler et al.,  ; Smallwood et al.,  ; Franklin et al.,  ; McVay and Kane,  ): mind-wandering interferes with reading comprehension because it engages regions of the DMN that are also important in making sense of what is being read. This competitive hypothesis assumes that there are common processes that underlie an individual\u2019s capability to make sense of what they are reading, which are also engaged by task-unrelated thinking. Whether the DMN helps or hinders the act of reading, therefore, may depend on whether its midline core is coupled to systems that represent the words on the page, or to the self-generated experiences that occupy our thoughts when the mind wanders. \n\n\n## Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 3825257, "text_md5": "476c1a0d6cee124a4ef32cb45388f8f4", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 209], "journal": [210, 228], "publication_year": [230, 234], "title": [245, 409], "keywords": [423, 563], "abstract": [576, 2192], "body": [2201, 38500]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 24282397, "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2013.00734", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3825257", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3825257"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3825257\">3825257</a>", "list_title": "PMC3825257  The default modes of reading: modulation of posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex connectivity associated with comprehension and task focus while reading"}

Here, we tested how hippocampal-neocortical pattern similarity and connectivity contributed to pain empathy. Using this approach, we analyzed a data set of 102 human participants who underwent functional MRI while painful and non-painful electrical stimulation was delivered to themselves or to a confederate. As hypothesized, results revealed increased pattern similarity between first-hand pain and pain empathy (compared to non-painful control conditions) within the hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, the temporo-parietal junction and anterior insula. While representations in these regions were unaffected by confederate similarity, pattern similarity in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex was increased the more dissimilar the other individual was perceived. Hippocampal-neocortical connectivity during first-hand pain and pain empathy engaged largely distinct but neighboring primary motor regions, and empathy-related hippocampal coupling with the fusiform gyrus positively scaled with trait measures of perspective taking. These findings suggest that shared representations and mental simulation might contribute to pain empathy via hippocampal-neocortical pattern similarity and connectivity, partially affected by personality traits and the similarity of the observed individual. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEmpathy describes sharing the emotional state of another person and is crucial for successful social interactions. The so-called \u2018shared representations account\u2019 suggests that empathy for an affective state engages similar neural processes as experiencing the affective state directly ( ;  ). In line with this assumption, previous studies implicated the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (or anterior mid-cingulate cortex; dACC/aMCC) and the anterior insula in the first-hand experience of pain and empathy ( ;  ;  ;  ). Furthermore, a recent study revealed neurons within the rat ACC that coded not only for first-hand pain but also fired when rats witnessed a conspecific receiving footshocks ( ). These data, however, stand in contrast to results from multivariate analyses that reported both shared and distinct representations during experienced emotions and empathy ( ,  ;  ), altogether fueling a long-standing debate on the neural underpinnings. \n\nBesides affect sharing, empathy is thought to depend on self-other distinction and mentalizing, i.e. mentally simulating the stance of another person ( ). Social cognition theories of mental simulation posit that individuals use their own mental states as models to understand the mental states and actions of others ( ). This has been associated with neural processing focused predominantly on the medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex (MPFC and PCC;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ), and the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ;  ;  ). The hippocampus and adjacent medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures have well-documented roles in recalling past ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and simulating (future) events ( ;  ;  ,  ;  ). Surprisingly, the potential contributions of these areas to empathic processing have been largely neglected (but see  ;  ). Here, we capitalized on hippocampal processing within a sizable sample of healthy participants that engaged in an empathy for pain task. \n\nOne-hundred-and-two participants underwent functional MRI while painful and non-painful electrical stimulation was delivered to themselves or to a confederate ( ). Importantly, this task was designed to elicit mental simulation processes while attenuating contributions of mirror neuron activity or motor mimicry. Participants were thus presented with a cue indicating the upcoming pain intensity rather than with pictures of the confederate in painful or non-painful situations. First, we hypothesized that if mental simulation contributes to pain empathy, participants should base the evaluation of another individual\u2019s pain on representations of their previous, first-hand pain experiences. This should involve similar neural representations between first-hand pain and pain empathy within the hippocampus and regions important for mental simulation and pain empathy, including the MPFC, PCC, TPJ, dACC/aMCC, and the anterior insula. For quantification, we derived the multivoxel pattern similarity across single trials, embedded within a whole-brain representational similarity analysis (RSA) framework. Second, we expected this to be dovetailed with the recall of recent information from memory. We thus tested increases in task-based connectivity during pain empathy between the hippocampus and neocortical regions that should also be involved when experiencing pain first-hand ( ). Third, because mental simulation was shown to depend on perceived similarity with the other individual ( ;  ), we further took into account individual ratings of confederate similarity and explored its relationship with neural pattern similarity. Lastly, we stratified our results with trait measures of empathy. By means of this integrative approach, we expected to shed new light on the engagement of hippocampal-neocortical regions, and thus the role of memory-based mental simulation processes in pain empathy. \n  \nPain empathy task and representational similarity analysis (RSA). (A) Examples for self- and other-directed trials during the pain empathy task. Participants first received a cue if the electrical shock was directed at themselves (upper row) or at the confederate (lower row). Arrow color provided information about the intensity of the upcoming electrical stimulation (red, painful; green, non-painful; not shown here). Participants then saw either a scrambled photo of themselves or a photo of the confederate showing a neutral or painful facial expression during non-painful and painful trials, respectively. After this, participants were asked to rate pain and unpleasantness during one-third of the trials. RSA was performed across single trials of the pain empathy task after trials were sorted according to task conditions (i.e. self pain, self no pain, other pain and other no pain): (B) pattern similarity was computed between (self pain \u00d7 self no pain) and (other pain \u00d7 other no pain) trials (C) and between (self pain \u00d7 other pain) and (self no pain \u00d7 other no pain) trials. Pattern similarity values were extracted from the respective quadrants (marked in black). \n  \n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nThis study was part of a larger project investigating the effects of placebo analgesia on pain and pain empathy ( ). In brief, participants had been randomly assigned to a placebo or control group and completed a pain empathy task, as well as an affective touch task (not discussed here), followed by the structural scan and a resting-state period (not discussed here), all inside the MR scanner. We previously reported results from univariate activation analysis of the pain empathy task, comparing placebo and control groups ( ). Here, we provide a novel analysis focused on pattern similarity and hippocampal connectivity during pain empathy. Separate analyses yielded highly similar results in both subgroups and no significant differences between the groups (not reported further). Since we were interested in generalized contributions of shared representations and mental simulation processes to pain empathy, we thus collapsed our analyses across the two groups. \n\n### Participants \n  \nOne-hundred-and-two participants were included in this analysis (see   for details) (70 females, age range\u2009=\u200919\u201338\u00a0years, mean age\u2009=\u200925). All were right-handed, healthy, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and gave written informed consent prior to participation. The study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna (Vienna, Austria). \n\n\n### Task and procedures \n  \n#### Electrical stimulation and pain calibration \n  \nIndividual intensity values (mA) for electrical stimulation were determined during pain calibration. This involved a staircase procedure where participants were asked to rate pain intensity after every electrical shock (500\u00a0ms) using a 7-point scale (1, \u2018perceptible, but no painful sensation\u2019; 7, \u2018extremely painful\u2019). The same scale was used for pain intensity ratings throughout the study. Electrical stimulation was delivered using a Digitimer DS5 Isolated Bipolar Constant Current Stimulator (Digitimer Ltd, Clinical & Biomedical Research Instruments) and a bipolar concentric surface electrode attached to the dorsum of the left hand. Shock delivery was controlled manually using Cogent (version 1.32,  ). \n\n\n#### Pain empathy task \n  \nDuring the pain empathy task, participants received a cue (2\u00a0s) if the electrical shock was directed at themselves (arrow pointing left, self-directed trial;  ) or at another participant (arrow pointing right, other-directed trial;  ). Additionally, the color of the arrow informed the participant about the upcoming stimulation intensity (red, painful; green, non-painful). The other participant was a member of the experimental team and actually never received any shocks. After a brief delay jittered between 2 and 5\u00a0s (mean\u2009=\u20093.5\u00a0s), participants saw a photo of the shock recipient on the screen (1\u00a0s; self-directed trial: scrambled photo of themselves; other-directed trial: photo of the confederate with painful/neutral facial expression), and a brief electrical shock (500\u00a0ms) was delivered (during self-directed trials only). This was followed by a fixation period ranging from 3 to 7\u00a0s (mean\u2009=\u20095\u00a0s) and affect ratings (6\u00a0s) which were collected during one-third of the trials (self-directed pain ratings: \u2018How painful was this stimulus for you?\u2019, other-directed affect ratings: \u2018How painful was this stimulus for the other person?\u2019, and \u2018How unpleasant did it feel when the other person was stimulated?\u2019). Trials were separated with a short fixation period (2\u00a0s). In total, participants completed 15 trials per condition (i.e. self-directed painful, self-directed non-painful, other-directed painful, other-directed non-painful). The task was programmed and presented with Cogent (version 1.32,  ) and lasted for approx. 16\u00a0min. \n\nStimulation intensities during self-directed trials were set to individually calibrated stimulation intensities related to pain ratings of 1 (i.e. non-painful trial) and 7 (i.e. painful trial) throughout the task. The average stimulation intensities were 0.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14\u00a0mA (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM; pain intensity rating of 1) and 0.74\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u00a0mA (pain intensity rating of 7) during non-painful and painful trials, respectively. \n\n\n#### Post-experimental ratings and questionnaire data \n  \nAfter MR scanning, participants rated how similar they perceived the confederate, how much they liked the other person, perceived affiliation with the other person, attributed strength, neediness and agreeableness. Here, we focused on perceived confederate similarity only (\u2018How similar was the other person to you?\u2019; 1, \u2018dissimilar\u2019; 9, \u2018very similar\u2019). This rating was not available for one participant and we thus excluded this person from all analyses that involved confederate similarity (i.e.   N  \u2009=\u2009101). To assess trait empathy, participants completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index online prior to the start of the experiment (IRI; subscales personal distress, perspective taking, empathic concern, fantasy;  ). \n\n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nImaging data were acquired using a 3 Tesla MRI scanner (Tim Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 32-channel head coil. We obtained approx. 500 T *-weighted BOLD images during the pain empathy task, using a multiband-accelerated echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence. Parameters were as follows: TR\u2009=\u20091800\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u200933\u00a0ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200960\u00b0, interleaved slice acquisition, 54 axial slices, FOV\u2009=\u2009192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192\u2009\u00d7\u2009108\u00a0mm, matrix size\u2009=\u2009128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128, voxel size\u2009=\u20091.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u00a0mm. Structural scans were acquired using a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence with the following parameters: TR\u2009=\u20092300\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u20094.21\u00a0ms, 160 sagittal slices, FOV\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u00a0mm, voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091.1\u00a0mm. \n\n\n### MRI data pre-processing \n  \nA detailed description of data preprocessing was reported previously ( ). In brief, data were processed using SPM12 ( ) and Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA), including slice time correction, spatial realignment, normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard space and spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel (6\u00a0mm full-width at half maximum, FWHM). \n\n\n### fMRI data modeling \n  \nFirst, we used representational similarity analysis (RSA;  ) to quantify neural pattern similarity during the pain empathy task. To this end, we obtained single-trial estimates by modeling trials as separate regressors ( ), time-locked to the onset of each trial\u2019s anticipation cue ( ). Events were estimated as a boxcar function with the duration set until the offset of the delivery screen (mean\u2009=\u20096.5\u00a0s, range\u2009=\u20095\u20138\u00a0s) and were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Rating periods (6\u00a0s) were combined within a task regressor of no interest, and the six realignment parameters were appended to capture the effects of head motion. A high-pass filter with a cutoff at 128\u00a0s was applied. This resulted in 60 single-trial beta estimates per subject that were used for subsequent RSA. \n\nSecond, we used psychophysiological interaction analysis (PPI;  ) to test connectivity during the pain empathy task. We thus adapted the first-level analysis such that trials of each condition were collapsed into four task regressors of interest (i.e. self pain, self no pain, other pain, other no pain;  ). The remaining regressors were modeled identically to the analysis above, and contrasts were computed to assess connectivity differences between pain and no pain conditions (i.e. self pain > self no pain, other pain > other no pain). \n\n\n### Representational similarity analysis (RSA) \n  \nWe moved a spherical searchlight ( ; see also  ) with a radius of 8\u00a0mm (251 voxels) throughout the brain volume while only considering searchlights that contained at least 30 gray matter voxels. Single-trial beta estimates from voxels within a given searchlight were extracted and reshaped into a trial \u00d7 voxel matrix, whereby trials were sorted according to the four experimental conditions (i.e. self pain, self no pain, other pain and other no pain). Data were   z  -scored across trials to remove mean activation differences, and voxel patterns of each trial were correlated with the voxel patterns of all other trials, resulting in a trial \u00d7 trial similarity matrix. This matrix was then Fisher\u2019s   z  -transformed and pattern similarity scores were calculated by averaging across the respective quadrants of the similarity matrix. First, we assessed pattern similarity for painful and non-painful electrical stimulation, separately for self-   vs   other-directed conditions ([self pain \u00d7 self no pain], [other pain \u00d7 other no pain];  ). Second, and central to our hypothesis, we assessed pattern similarity between self- and other-directed trials during painful   vs   non-painful electrical stimulation ([self pain \u00d7 other pain], [self no pain \u00d7 other no pain];  ). The pattern similarity values were then assigned to each searchlight\u2019s center voxel, yielding four 3-dimensional whole-brain pattern similarity maps per subject. \n\nGroup-level significance was tested with paired-sample   t  -tests, comparing pattern similarity (i) of self-   vs   other-directed trials during painful and non-painful electrical stimulation (i.e. [self pain \u00d7 self no pain]   vs   [other pain \u00d7 other no pain]) and (ii) between self- and other-directed trials during painful   vs   non-painful electrical stimulation (i.e. [self pain \u00d7 other pain]   vs   [self no pain \u00d7 other no pain]). We applied cluster-inference with a cluster-defining threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 and a cluster-probability threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons for all analyses. The corrected cluster size threshold (i.e. the spatial extent of a cluster that is required in order to be labeled as significant) was calculated using the SPM extension \u2018CorrClusTh.m\u2019 and the Newton-Raphson search method (script provided by Thomas Nichols, University of Warwick, United Kingdom, and Marko Wilke, University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany;  ). Anatomical nomenclature was obtained from the Laboratory for Neuro Imaging (LONI) Brain Atlas (LBPA40,  ). \n\n#### Association of pattern similarity with confederate similarity and trait empathy \n  \nWe further tested if pattern similarity between self- and other-directed trials during the pain empathy task was associated with the perceived similarity of the confederate, as well as with the different aspects of trait empathy (i.e. IRI subscales). We calculated individual difference maps, subtracting pattern similarity between self- and other-related non-painful trials from pattern similarity between self- and other-related painful trials in a voxel-wise manner (i.e. [self pain \u00d7 other pain] \u2212 [self no pain \u00d7 other no pain]). These pattern similarity-difference maps were then submitted to separate linear regression analyses with individual ratings of perceived confederate similarity or trait empathy added as a covariate of interest. \n\n\n\n### Connectivity analysis \n  \nWe performed two PPI analyses (contrasts self pain > self no pain, other pain > other no pain) with a seed placed within the anatomical boundaries of the left hippocampus (based on the Automatic Anatomical Labeling atlas;  ). The first eigenvector of the seed\u2019s time course was extracted (i.e. the physiological factor) and adjusted for average activation during the task using an   F  -contrast. The eigenvector was then convolved with the respective task condition (i.e. the psychological factor), and connectivity positively related to this interaction was investigated. Contrasts were then submitted to one-sample   t  -test for random-effects, second-level analysis. \n\n\n### Availability of raw data, RSA code, and unthresholded statistical maps \n  \nAll anonymized data are available upon request to the authors. The RSA code is openly available on GitHub ( ) and unthresholded statistical maps are accessible on   ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Pattern similarity specific for self- and other-directed electrical stimulation \n  \nAs the first analysis step, we investigated general differences between the neural representations of self- compared to other-directed painful and non-painful electrical stimulation across trials using whole-brain multivoxel pattern similarity (i.e. the main effect of stimulation target; [self pain \u00d7 self no pain]   vs   [other pain \u00d7 other no pain]). Results revealed increased pattern similarity within bilateral insula, dACC/aMCC, right primary motor and somatosensory cortices (note that electrical stimulation was delivered to the left hand) and (lateral) occipital regions during self- compared to other-directed electrical stimulation (contrast [self pain \u00d7 self no pain]\u2009>\u2009[other pain \u00d7 other no pain];  ,  ). Conversely, during other- compared to self-directed electrical stimulation, we found increased pattern similarity in bilateral fusiform gyrus and surrounding inferior temporal cortex, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, striatum and subgenual ACC, as well as anterior and posterior midline structures (contrast [other pain \u00d7 other no pain]\u2009>\u2009[self pain \u00d7 self no pain];  ,  ). To provide a manipulation check of the results, we conducted additional analysis that captured pattern similarity specific for painful (compared to non-painful) first-hand pain and pain empathy (see   and  ). \n  \nPattern similarity specific for self- and other-directed electrical stimulation. Increased pattern similarity during (A) [self pain \u00d7 self no pain]\u2009>\u2009[other pain \u00d7 other no pain] and (B) [other pain \u00d7 other no pain]\u2009>\u2009[self pain \u00d7 self no pain]. Results are shown at   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWE-corrected at cluster-level; see also  ). L, left; LH, left hemisphere; RH, right hemisphere. Structure labels: SSC, somatosensory cortex; PMC, primary motor cortex; dACC/aMCC, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/anterior mid-cingulate cortex; INS, insula; LOC, lateral occipital cortex; PreC, precuneus; dMPFC, dorsal medial prefrontal cortex; ATL, anterior temporal lobe; HC, hippocampus; PHC, parahippocampal gyrus; sgACC, subgenual ACC; FG, fusiform gyrus. \n    \nPattern similarity specific for self- and other-directed electrical stimulation \n  \nMNI coordinates represent the location of peak voxels. We report the first local maximum within each cluster. Effects were tested for significance using cluster inference with a cluster-defining threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 and a cluster probability of   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons (critical cluster size: 605 voxels). L, left; R, right; Inf, infinite values. \n  \n\n### Pattern similarity of first-hand pain and pain empathy \n  \nThe next step comprised the critical test of our main hypothesis, i.e. if mental simulation contributed to pain empathy, participants should utilize first-hand pain experiences to evaluate the pain of another individual. This should be associated with increased multivoxel pattern similarity (a proxy for similar neural representations) in the hippocampus and surrounding MTL. Furthermore, we expected increased pattern similarity in distributed regions known to play a role in mental simulation and pain empathy such as the MPFC, PCC, TPJ, dACC/aMCC, and the anterior insula. We reasoned that empathic processing should be increased during pain and thus tested our predictions by contrasting the pattern similarity of self- and other-directed electrical stimulation between painful and non-painful trials (i.e. [self pain \u00d7 other pain]   vs   [self no pain \u00d7 other no pain]). \n\nResults showed increased pattern similarity between self- and other-directed painful compared to non-painful electrical stimulation within the left hippocampus, bilateral retrosplenial cortex, extending into the fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal cortex, (lateral) occipital regions, bilateral TPJ, bilateral anterior insula and the right primary motor cortex (contrast [self pain \u00d7 other pain]\u2009>\u2009[self no pain \u00d7 other no pain];  ,  ). Effects for self-other similarity during non-painful relative to painful electrical stimulation were located in left visual and somatosensory cortices (contrast [self no pain \u00d7 other no pain]\u2009>\u2009[self pain \u00d7 other pain]; not shown in figure, see  ). Thus, as expected, the multivoxel patterns between first-hand pain and pain empathy appeared similar in the hippocampus, inferior temporal and retrosplenial cortex, TPJ, primary motor cortex and anterior insula. \n  \nPattern similarity of first-hand pain and pain empathy and relation with perceived confederate similarity. (A) Increased pattern similarity during [self pain \u00d7 other pain]\u2009>\u2009[self no pain \u00d7 other no pain]. (B) Increased pattern similarity between first-hand pain and pain empathy was coupled to lower perceived confederate similarity across participants. For visualization purposes, the scatter plot shows the relationship between individual ratings of perceived confederate similarity and pattern similarity (Fisher\u2019s   z   values), extracted from the significant cluster within the dorsal MPFC. Results for both (A) and (B) are shown at   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWE-corrected at cluster-level; see also  ). L, left; LH, left hemisphere; RH, right hemisphere. Structure labels: TPJ, temporo-parietal junction; PMC, primary motor cortex; LOC, lateral occipital cortex; HC, hippocampus; aINS, anterior insula; RSPC, retrosplenial cortex; dMPFC, dorsal medial prefrontal cortex. \n    \nPattern similarity of first-hand pain and pain empathy and relation with perceived confederate similarity \n  \nMNI coordinates represent the location of peak voxels. We report the first local maximum within each cluster. Effects were tested for significance using cluster inference with a cluster-defining threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 and a cluster probability of   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons (critical cluster sizes: paired-samples   t  -test, 591 voxels; linear regression, 196 voxels). L, left; R, right; Inf, infinite values. \n  \n\n### Pattern similarity and relation to perceived confederate similarity \n  \nIt has been repeatedly posited and partly confirmed that perceived similarity between self and other should be conducive to higher empathy and affective simulation (see e.g.  ). Thus, we explored whether pattern similarity of first-hand pain and pain empathy might scale with how similar participants perceived the confederate. We tested this by assessing the linear cross-participant relationship between whole-brain pattern similarity of self- and other-directed painful (compared to non-painful) stimulation with confederate similarity which was rated post-experimentally. We found that increased pattern similarity was indeed negatively associated with confederate similarity in the dorsal MPFC ( ;  ). In other words, more similar multivoxel patterns in the dorsal MPFC during first-hand pain and pain empathy were correlated with lower perceived confederate similarity across participants. No other brain region showed a significant negative or positive relationship between pattern and confederate similarities. Furthermore, there was no significant association between pattern similarity and aspects of trait empathy (i.e. subscales of the IRI). To conclude, pattern similarity between first-hand pain and pain empathy was modulated by perceived confederate similarity within the dorsal MPFC. \n\n\n### Hippocampal-neocortical connectivity during first-hand pain and pain empathy \n  \nWe next reasoned that if participants used representations of their previous first-hand pain experiences to evaluate the pain of others, then this should be paralleled by the recall of recent information from memory. On a neural level, this should be indexed by increased hippocampal coupling with neocortical regions that were also involved when experiencing pain first-hand. Above, we reported increased pattern similarity between first-hand pain and pain empathy within the hippocampus, whereby results appeared left lateralized ( ;  ). We thus placed a seed within the anatomical boundaries of the left hippocampus in order to test connectivity during self- and other-directed painful compared to non-painful electrical stimulation. \n\nFirst, we found increased hippocampal coupling with bilateral insula, dACC/aMCC, thalamus, right primary motor and somatosensory cortices, lateral prefrontal and occipital regions when participants received painful electrical stimulation themselves (contrast self pain > self no pain;  ;  ). Second, results showed increased hippocampal connectivity with the left fusiform gyrus and right primary motor cortex when painful electrical shocks were delivered to the confederate (contrast other pain > other no pain;  ;  ). To test for potential overlap of hippocampal-neocortical connectivity during first-hand pain and pain empathy, we performed a conjunction analysis (i.e. [self pain > self no pain] \u2229 [other pain > other no pain]). Results yielded a cluster within the right primary motor cortex (peak MNI coordinate of local maximum:   x  \u2009=\u200952,   y  \u2009=\u2009\u22122,   z  \u2009=\u200952,   z  -value\u2009=\u20094.14, 11 voxels,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 uncorrected for multiple comparisons), which did not survive cluster-correction. Thus, the left hippocampus appears coupled to largely distinct neocortical areas and similar regions within the primary motor cortex during both first-hand pain and pain empathy. \n  \nHippocampal connectivity and association with perspective taking. Hippocampal connectivity increases during (A) self pain > self no pain and (B) other pain > other no pain. The anatomical seed region within the left hippocampus is marked in red. Results are shown at   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWE-corrected at cluster-level; see also  ). (C) Connectivity of the left hippocampus with the left fusiform gyrus (a.u., arbitrary units) showed a positive relationship with perspective taking (IRI subscale). Thus, stronger coupling was associated with higher scores in perspective taking across subjects.  The correlation remained robust when removing three outliers (mean \u00b1 3 standard deviations; one outlier in IRI perspective taking, two outliers in connectivity;   r   = 0.22,   P   = 0.026, bootstrapped 95% confidence interval based on 5000 samples [0.053 0.4]), and when applying Spearman\u2019s rank correlation (  r  \u2009=\u20090.25,   P  \u2009=\u20090.011, bootstrapped 95% CI [0.07 0.43]; removing three outliers:   r  \u2009=\u20090.23,   P  \u2009=\u20090.025, bootstrapped 95% CI [0.05 0.41]), but none of these results survived correction for multiple comparisons (\u03b1 \u2009=\u20090.01). L, left; LH, left hemisphere; RH, right hemisphere. Structure labels: SSC, somatosensory cortex; PMC, primary motor cortex; dACC/aMCC, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/anterior mid-cingulate cortex; Thal, thalamus; INS, insula; FG, fusiform gyrus. \n    \nHippocampal connectivity \n  \nMNI coordinates represent the location of peak voxels. We report the first local maximum within each cluster. Effects were tested for significance using cluster inference with a cluster-defining threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 and a cluster probability of   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons (critical cluster sizes: self pain > self no pain, 96 voxels; other pain > other no pain, 82 voxels). L, left; R, right. \n  \n\n### Hippocampal-neocortical connectivity and association with trait empathy \n  \nLast, we examined if hippocampal-neocortical coupling scaled with confederate similarity or aspects of trait empathy. Connectivity between the hippocampus and the left fusiform gyrus positively correlated with individual differences in perspective taking (i.e. the IRI subscale). Put differently, participants who scored higher on perspective taking showed stronger hippocampal-fusiform connectivity during pain empathy (  r  \u2009=\u20090.26,   P  \u2009=\u20090.009, bootstrapped 95% CI based on 5000 samples [0.08 0.44], Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons using a threshold of   \u03b1  \u2009=\u20090.01 (0.05/5);  ). There was no significant association of empathy-related hippocampus-fusiform gyrus connectivity with confederate similarity (  P  \u2009=\u20090.557), and no significant association with the remaining IRI subscales (IRI personal distress:   P  \u2009=\u20090.701, IRI empathic concern:   P  \u2009=\u20090.053, IRI fantasy:   P  \u2009=\u20090.098). In addition, there was no significant relationship between hippocampus-primary motor cortex connectivity during pain empathy and any of the behavioral measures (confederate similarity:   P  \u2009=\u20090.976, IRI personal distress:   P  \u2009=\u20090.697, IRI perspective taking:   P  \u2009=\u20090.313, IRI empathic concern:   P  \u2009=\u20090.950, IRI fantasy: 0.946). In summary, increases of hippocampal connectivity with the fusiform gyrus during pain empathy were larger in participants with higher self-reported perspective taking skills. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe investigated contributions of hippocampal-neocortical representations and connectivity to pain empathy. Our analyses revealed four main findings: first, we found increased pattern similarity between first-hand pain and pain empathy within the hippocampus and a neocortical network, including inferior temporal and retrosplenial cortex, TPJ, primary motor cortex and anterior insula. Second, we showed that increased pattern similarity between first-hand pain and pain empathy within the dorsal MPFC was coupled to lower perceived confederate similarity across participants. Third, results demonstrated that hippocampal-neocortical coupling during first-hand pain and pain empathy was largely distinct but engaged neighboring regions within the primary motor cortex. Fourth, hippocampal connectivity with the fusiform gyrus during pain empathy was larger at higher self-reported skills in perspective taking. These findings suggest that shared representations and mental simulation might contribute to pain empathy via hippocampal-neocortical pattern similarity and connectivity, partially affected by personality traits and the similarity of the observed individual. \n\nWe hypothesized that if mental simulation processes support pain empathy, participants should utilize first-hand pain experiences as a model to evaluate the pain of another individual as indicated by similar neural representations, approximated by multivoxel pattern similarity. As expected, results showed increased pattern similarity within the hippocampus, extending into inferior temporal and retrosplenial cortices, TPJ, primary motor cortex and anterior insula ( ). The hippocampus is regarded as key player for successfully remembering past ( ;  ;  ) and simulating future ( ;  ;  ) or fictitious events ( ), and it therefore seems vital for mental construction ( ;  ;  ;  ) and self-projection ( ;  ). Hippocampal lesions in human patients, for instance, were shown to impair the ability to imagine new experiences ( ;  ). Importantly,  ) reported lower trait empathy in patients with focal hippocampal damage, along with no effect of empathy induction on empathy ratings or prosocial behavior ( ; and see also  ). These findings collectively suggest a role of the hippocampus in empathy and mental simulation. Moreover, the MPFC ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ) and PCC (including precuneus and retrosplenial cortex;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) are considered pivotal for mental construction and self-projection as well, and are also engaged during theory of mind ( ,  ;  ;  ). The latter additionally involves the TPJ, possibly signaling perspective taking to simulate the mental stance of another person ( ;  ;  ). To summarize, the hippocampus, MPFC, PCC and TPJ constitute a distributed set of brain regions associated with memory, mental construction and simulation, self-projection and theory of mind. Here, we observed that these regions support pain empathy as well, holding similar representations when experiencing pain first-hand and when observing pain in another individual. \n\nEmpathy, however, also incorporates affect sharing and self-other distinction ( ). While the latter was associated with neural processing within the TPJ ( ), affect sharing may depend on shared representations during the first-hand (pain) experience and empathy for it ( ;  ). This was linked to neural processing within the dACC/aMCC and anterior insula ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ), including an initial, univariate analysis of the current study ( ). Here, we partly confirmed and extended previous findings: First, we found increased pattern similarity within the dACC/aMCC and insula during first-hand pain (compared to pain empathy), while pain empathy (compared to first-hand pain) was associated with the hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, MPFC and PCC ( ). Second, we tackled the question of shared neural representations between first-hand pain and pain empathy and found increased pattern similarity in a set of regions, including bilateral anterior insula ( ). The insula was associated with pain processing ( ;  ) and interoceptive awareness ( ,  ), and similar neural representations might thus signal affective sharing with the observed individual ( ;  ). Somewhat surprising and unexpectedly, we could not identify increased pattern similarity within the dACC/aMCC. While previous work showed overlapping neural assemblies representing first-hand pain and pain empathy within the rodent dACC/aMCC ( ;  ), others reported a domain-general role of this region in empathic processing ( ). Also, the dACC/aMCC seems to be recruited by regulatory processes and appears less involved in representing self- or other-related feelings ( ;  ). To conclude, we found shared neural representations between first-hand pain and pain empathy in the anterior insula that, together with the hippocampus, MPFC, PCC and TPJ, appear to support empathy, potentially via affect sharing and mental simulation. \n\nEmpathic processing and associated mental simulation might depend on how similar the individual is perceived to oneself. We found that lower perceived confederate similarity was associated with increased pattern similarity between first-hand pain and pain empathy in the dorsal MPFC ( ). The dorsal MPFC was previously implicated in self-projection and perspective taking ( ;  ), self-inhibition/other-enhancement during mental simulation ( ) and prosocial behavior ( ).  ) showed that judgements of similar and dissimilar others were associated with activation changes in ventral and dorsal MPFC, respectively. Furthermore, MPFC activation was shown to be greater with increasing discrepancy between self- and other-related judgements ( ). In line with this, our findings also suggest a specific role of the dorsal MPFC in mental simulation, particularly if the other individual is perceived as less similar to oneself. \n\nNext, we hypothesized empathy-related mental simulation to be dovetailed with memory recall of the recently experienced painful stimulation. We found increased hippocampal connectivity with left fusiform gyrus and right primary motor cortex during pain empathy ( ). A neighboring region within the primary motor cortex was also engaged when participants experienced electrical stimulation to the left hand ( ). Memories are assumed to be stored in distributed neocortical networks ( ;  ). The hippocampus is thought to coordinate memory retrieval through coupling with neocortical regions that were engaged during the actual experience ( ). Increased hippocampal connectivity with the right primary motor cortex during pain empathy might thus be related to the recall of recently experienced pain. Overall, however, hippocampal-neocortical coupling during first-hand pain and pain empathy was largely distinct. For instance, the former connectivity profile appeared much more distributed, which might be related to a stronger emotional response due to the direct electrical stimulation during first-hand pain ( ). Conclusions about memory recall require further research that, e.g. directly assesses memory re-activation during empathic processing. Furthermore, participants with higher trait measures in perspective taking showed stronger hippocampal coupling with the fusiform gyrus during pain empathy. This lends itself to speculate that the fusiform gyrus contributed to simulation processes, presumably coding for the content of visual imagination ( ;  ). Yet, results should be evaluated cautiously since correlations were modest and did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. \n\nEmpathy, including affect sharing ( ) or mental simulation ( ;  ;  ,  ,  ,  ), might ultimately motivate prosocial behavior.  ) showed that episodic simulation and memory of helping another individual in need positively affected the willingness to help others ( ;  ). Prosocial behavior appears increased the more vividly participants engage in mental simulation or memory recall of helping behavior ( ,  ,  ), and this involved the MTL and TPJ ( ). While the link between empathy, mental simulation and prosocial behavior warrants further investigation, results suggest that mental simulation might contribute to empathy through neural processes in hippocampal-neocortical ensembles. \n\nLastly, our approach draws on an indirect investigation of mental simulation and shared representations related to pain empathy. Our results confirm our   a priori   expectations of increased hippocampal-neocortical pattern similarity and connectivity. Although an interpretation of the results in terms of mental simulation processes and memory recall during pain empathy appears likely ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), conclusions should be drawn with caution. Future studies should investigate mental simulation and empathy within the same study and could then directly link both. Nevertheless, our results provide novel insights into hippocampal processing during empathy, corroborating previous findings on empathy deficits in amnesia ( ) and traumatic brain injury ( ). \n\nTo conclude, our findings highlight the contributions of hippocampal-neocortical representations and connectivity to pain empathy, partially affected by personality traits and the similarity of the other individual in pain. This might potentially indicate shared representations and mental simulation during empathy, bearing important practical implications for empathy in patients suffering from hippocampal damage or fronto-temporal dementia. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7235961, "text_md5": "d98580dac191972f0cb9884f4c650137", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 53], "journal": [54, 78], "publication_year": [80, 84], "title": [95, 190], "keywords": [204, 296], "abstract": [309, 1723], "body": [1732, 40950]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 32248233, "doi": "10.1093/scan/nsaa045", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7235961", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7235961"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7235961\">7235961</a>", "list_title": "PMC7235961  Pattern similarity and connectivity of hippocampal-neocortical regions support empathy for pain"}

Twenty participants performed a complex cognitive task in either safe or aversive conditions. Our results showed that increased mental workload induced recruitment of the lateral frontoparietal executive control network (ECN), along with disengagement of medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate regions of the default mode network (DMN). Mental workload also elicited an increase in heart rate and pupil diameter. Task performance did not decrease under the threat of stressors, most likely due to efficient inhibition of auditory regions, as reflected by a large decrement of activity in the superior temporal gyri. The threat of stressors was also accompanied with deactivations of limbic regions of the salience network (SN), possibly reflecting emotional regulation mechanisms through control from dorsal medial prefrontal and parietal regions, as indicated by functional connectivity analyses. Meanwhile, the threat of stressors induced enhanced ECN activity, likely for improved attentional and cognitive processes toward the task, as suggested by increased lateral prefrontal and parietal activations. These fMRI results suggest that measuring the balance between ECN, SN, and DMN recruitment could be used for objective mental state assessment. In this sense, an extra recruitment of task\u2010related regions and a high ratio of lateral versus medial prefrontal activity may represent a relevant marker of increased but efficient mental effort, while the opposite may indicate a disengagement from the task due to mental overload and/or stressors. \n  \nWe highlighted patterns of brain activations and autonomic activity when confronted with high mental workload and auditory stressors.

Complex and safety\u2010critical activities, such as piloting an airplane or operating a nuclear power plant, can lead to a drastic and simultaneous increase of both mental workload and acute stress. These effects originate from a combination of task complexity (Borghini, Astolfi, Vecchiato, Mattia, & Babiloni,\u00a0 ; Causse, Chua, Peysakhovich, Del Campo, & Matton,\u00a0 ; Durantin, Gagnon, Tremblay, & Dehais,\u00a0 ) and the potentially fatal consequence of errors (Kilic & Ucler,\u00a0 ). In this context, the maintenance of optimal cognitive performance is a constant challenge. According to several authors, high mental workload (Causse, Peysakhovich, & Fabre,\u00a0 ) and acute stress (Arnsten,\u00a0 ; Qin, Hermans, Marle, Luo, & Fern\u00e1ndez,\u00a0 ; Schoofs, Wolf, & Smeets,\u00a0 ; Starcke, Wiesen, Trotzke, & Brand,\u00a0 ) may both result in transient cognitive deficits, that is, impairments in executive functions and working memory (WM) in particular. Meanwhile, cerebral compensatory processes may be engaged and contribute to preserving cognitive performance (Fairclough & Mulder,\u00a0 ). A primary objective for improving safety in these critical situations is therefore a better understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms involved in either maintenance or deterioration of cognitive performance under challenging conditions. \n\nEnhanced task complexity can result in an increase of mental effort, corresponding to the amount of brain resources/cognitive capacity an individual puts into a task (Galy, Cariou, & M\u00e9lan,\u00a0 ), which might be indexed via brain activity or autonomic parameters (e.g., level of brain activity and pupil size). Task complexity also likely leads to greater mental workload, often inferred from overt behavior or performance. Mental workload roughly corresponds to the interplay between the demands of the environment (input load), human individual characteristics (capacities) and task performance (output) (Causse et al.,\u00a0 ). A decrease in cognitive task performance will occur whenever there is a mismatch between environmental demands and individual capabilities, that is, if the workload is too high or too low (Kantowitz & Casper,\u00a0 ). Thus, taking into account solely the task characteristics does now allow inferring the level of mental workload in an individual. \n\nIn the scientific literature, mental workload and stress are often designated indistinctively with terms like \u201cmental stress\u201d (Hjortskov et al.,\u00a0 ), probably because their causes and effects can be similar. Also, their occurrence can be concomitant: a task generating an important mental workload can lead to an increase in mental stress because the individual will be overwhelmed by the difficulty (Warm, Parasuraman, & Matthews,\u00a0 ) or will feel the situation as emotionally challenging. However, mental workload and stress may reasonably be considered as distinct phenomena (Hidalgo\u2010Mu\u00f1oz et al.,\u00a0 ). According to Gaillard\u00a0( ), it is possible to work quite hard on difficult and complex tasks, even under unfavorable conditions, without cognitive strain or adverse physiological effects. High task demands can be met by mobilizing extra cognitive resources. In contrast, mental stress is regarded by Gaillard as a state, in which cognitive resources allocation is inefficient and disturbed by negative emotions. In other words, a high level of mental workload does not necessarily elicit a high stress level, and a high stress level may also occur when mental workload is low. Altogether, these results underline the difficulty to disentangle cognitively\u2010demanding from acute stress situations, as well as the importance of determining physiological mechanisms supporting both these situations and their possible co\u2010occurrence. \n\nComplex physiological and brain mechanisms take place with both high mental workload and acute stress. The executive control network (ECN) is of particular importance regarding cognitive load management. The ECN comprises the lateral and medial parts of the dorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC), premotor regions and the lateral posterior parietal cortex. Its role is crucial for sustained and selective attention, cognitive flexibility, WM, and decision making in goal\u2010directed behaviors (Corbetta & Shulman,\u00a0 ). During effortful tasks, increased demands on executive functions and WM enhance activity in the fronto\u2010parietal network of the ECN and in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Ayaz et al.,\u00a0 ; Dosenbach, Fair, Cohen, Schlaggar, & Petersen,\u00a0 ; Engstr\u00f6m, Karlsson, Landtblom, & Craig,\u00a0 ; Khachouf, Chen, Duzzi, Porro, & Pagnoni,\u00a0 ; Mulert et al.,\u00a0 ; Owen, McMillan, Laird, & Bullmore,\u00a0 ; Power & Petersen,\u00a0 ; Schmidt et al.,\u00a0 ; Shenhav, Botvinick, & Cohen,\u00a0 ; Shenhav et al.,\u00a0 ). In particular, dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) activity increases linearly with WM load (Braver et al.,\u00a0 ), suggesting that the DLPFC region of the ECN represents a reliable proxy measure of mental workload (Mandrick, Peysakhovich, R\u00e9my, Lepron, & Causse,\u00a0 ; Parent, Peysakhovich, Mandrick, Tremblay, & Causse,\u00a0 ). A study of Shen et al.\u00a0( ) showed that connection strength between regions of the ECN is strongly correlated with executive function performance. High mental workload does not only elicit enhanced activity in the ECN: several brain regions can show reduced activity during the performance of demanding tasks, including the medial prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex, and the precuneus. This set of regions belong to the default mode network (DMN) (Fransson & Marrelec,\u00a0 ; Greicius, Krasnow, Reiss, & Menon,\u00a0 ; Raichle et al.,\u00a0 ; Ward et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nECN activity is influenced not only by mental workload but also by acute stress (Arnsten, Wang, & Paspalas,\u00a0 ; Hermans, Henckens, Jo\u00ebls, & Fern\u00e1ndez,\u00a0 ; Van Oort et al.,\u00a0 ). Depending on its level, stress may either improve or deteriorate the ECN function. Moderate levels of stress may induce a more efficient PFC function (Arnsten,\u00a0 ; Yuen et al.,\u00a0 ), while a highly stressful condition would induce an impaired PFC function (Arnsten et al.,\u00a0 ). Other large brain networks seem to be sensitive to increased stress levels. During episodes of high levels of stress, engagement of the amygdala and related limbic structures has been reported, with significant activity in the anterior insula, the dorsal ACC, the hippocampus, and the hypothalamus (Hermans et al.,\u00a0 ; Van Oort et al.,\u00a0 ). This set of regions has been described as the salience network (SN). Involvement of the SN may sustain the orientation of attention toward salient information to promote threat detection. Accordingly, SN activity decreases under low or moderate levels of stress (Pruessner et al.,\u00a0 ), while predominant involvement of the SN is observed under highly stressful situations. \n\nFew imaging studies have investigated the combined effects of cognitive workload and stressors. Under stress, activity in lateral PFC regions of the ECN implied in the cognitive task either increases (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Porcelli et al.,\u00a0 ), remains unchanged (Cousijn, Rijpkema, Qin, van Wingen, & Fern\u00e1ndez,\u00a0 ) or decreases (Qin et al.,\u00a0 ). Accordingly, the PFC could have a critical role in mediating stress influence on cognition (Bogdanov & Schwabe,\u00a0 ; Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Porcelli et al.,\u00a0 ; Shields, Sazma, & Yonelinas,\u00a0 ). Moreover, when acute stress and high cognitive load are combined, a dynamic interplay between ECN, DMN, and SN, possibly driven by the dorsal ACC and the ventral lateral PFC (VLPFC) (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Pruessner et al.,\u00a0 ; Simpson, Snyder, Gusnard, & Raichle,\u00a0 ), may enable the reallocation of neural resources. A shift toward the SN and DMN would reduce cognitive efficiency (Qin et al.,\u00a0 ) and enhance environment scanning at the cost of cognitive performance ensured by the ECN. Conversely, a shift toward the ECN, along with top\u2010down inhibition of the SN and DMN, may enable preservation of cognitive performance under stress. In previous studies, mental workload was elicited with WM tests such as two\u2010back letter or digit tasks. These tasks were combined with acute stress induced by an aversive movie (Cousijn et al.,\u00a0 ; Qin et al.,\u00a0 ), the threat of shock (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ), or the cold pressor test (Duncko, Johnson, Merikangas, & Grillon,\u00a0 ; Porcelli et al.,\u00a0 ). In these studies, high\u2010load WM task accuracy was preserved under stress. Preservation of WM performance may pertain to the relatively moderate perceived workload and the involvement of emotion regulation mechanisms. Conversely, other studies have reported reduced performance following exposure to stressors, either psychosocial (Jiang & Rau,\u00a0 ; Schoofs, Preu\u00df, & Wolf,\u00a0 ) or physical (cold pressor test) (Schoofs et al.,\u00a0 ). Hence, there is no clear pattern for the influence of stress on cognition, this influence being likely dependent on the height of the cognitive load and the level and nature of stress. In particular, it still remains unclear whether performance on a more demanding cognitive task, relying on the ECN and efficient PFC function, could be maintained under stressors (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Porcelli et al.,\u00a0 ; Schoofs et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nIn the present fMRI study, we investigated performance and brain activity during a highly difficult task performed under varying levels of task difficulty and the threat of stressors. We introduced a paradigm that reproduces the mentally challenging conditions that operators face during degraded contexts. To achieve this aim, we used the novel Toulouse n\u2010bask task (TNT) that combines a classical n\u2010back task with mental arithmetic. The n\u2010back WM paradigms were consistently shown to imply bilateral DLPFC and dorsal lateral parietal regions. Mental calculation involves a large\u2010scale network, including lateral and medial prefrontal and motor regions, as well as inferior and superior parietal cortex (Gruber, Indefrey, Steinmetz, & Kleinschmidt,\u00a0 ; Klein, Moeller, Glauche, Weiller, & Willmes,\u00a0 ; Kong et al.,\u00a0 ). By combining n\u2010back WM and mental arithmetic processes, the TNT task was thus thought to rely heavily on an extended fronto\u2010parietal network encompassing the ECN, and was conceived to mimic the multidimensional high mental workload existing in many safety\u2010critical occupations such as aircraft piloting (Mandrick et al.,\u00a0 ). In addition, this novel n\u2010back task was completely embedded into a threatening or safe context. The threatening context was induced using frequent but unexpected occurrences of aversive auditory stimuli played in parallel with the task. This induction method is potentially more efficient than the use of a punctual emotional induction delivered before the task, whose effects can fade out progressively, for example, when using an emotional movie clip before task execution (Cousijn et al.,\u00a0 ; Du et al.,\u00a0 ; Jiang & Rau,\u00a0 ; Qin et al.,\u00a0 ). Also, previous research using physical stressors during task performance may have been confounded by distraction effects due to the salience of the stimulus (Duncko et al.,\u00a0 ; Porcelli et al.,\u00a0 ; Schoofs et al.,\u00a0 ). In this study, we were interested in the experienced stress per se, we thus excluded the time period during which the aversive stimuli were delivered, focusing on the effects of the threat of unpredictable loud unpleasant sounds. Another important aspect of the experimental paradigm was the manipulation of both task difficulty and the presence of stressors while measuring pupil diameter and cardiac activity, both being particularly sensitive to mental effort (Eysenck & Calvo,\u00a0 ; Fairclough & Houston,\u00a0 ; Gray & Braver,\u00a0 ; Peysakhovich, Causse, Scannella, & Dehais,\u00a0 ) and stress (DeBeck, Petersen, Jones, & Stickland,\u00a0 ; Yao et al.,\u00a0 ). Such physiological recordings are feasible in situ, for example, in cockpits during flight. Thus concurrent neuroimaging and physiological measures during variable mental load and stress conditions are particularly relevant (Aln\u00e6s et al.,\u00a0 ; Brown et al.,\u00a0 ; Khachouf et al.,\u00a0 ; Mandrick et al.,\u00a0 ; Parent et al.,\u00a0 ; Wang et al.,\u00a0 ). We thus investigated how brain activity co\u2010varied with these two physiological measurements thanks to parametric modulation analyses. \n\nWe hypothesized that cognitive performance would deteriorate under high workload and we expected greater involvement of the ECN regions, particularly the DLPFC and the lateral parietal cortex, and deactivations of the DMN, altogether suggesting increased mental workload due to the challenging task. Both heart rate and pupil diameter should be increased. We also expected that performance should be relatively preserved under stress induction thanks to emotional regulation. However we expected that the combination of high task difficulty and stress induction may lead to an overload of the ECN. A marked decrease of task performance and an opposite brain pattern of activations to those observed under the high workload should be observed, with a decrease in the ECN regions along with SN activations. Heart rate and pupil diameter might be either increased or decreased since a disengaging of the task may occur, generating a decline of the sympathetic activity, while the stress could, on the contrary, increase sympathetic activity. \n\n\n## METHODS AND MATERIALS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty young, healthy participants (6 females, 14 males; mean age\u00a0=\u00a024\u2009years,   SD   =\u20093.9\u2009years and range\u00a0=\u00a020\u201334) were involved in this study. All had studied for at least 2\u2009years at university (after completion of their secondary education). Four participants were left\u2010handed, while the others were right\u2010handed. The hand dominance did not affect behavioral performance reported in this study. None reported either affective or anxiety disorders or any neurological or cardiovascular disease. None were under any form of medication that might affect the brain or autonomic functions. All participants reported normal auditory acuity and normal or corrected\u2010to\u2010normal vision. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki for human experimentation and was approved by a National Ethics Board (CPP du Sud\u2010Ouest et Outre\u2010Mer IV, no. CPP15\u2010010b/2015\u2010A00458\u201041). All participants signed a consent form and were paid for their participation. They were informed that they would be submitted to unpleasant loud sounds in the MRI scanner. \n\n\n### Stress induction \n  \nStress (sustained anxiety) induction was performed with the threat of unpredictable loud unpleasant sounds, such as blackboard scratching, plate scratching with a fork, dentist's drill, and so on (Patel et al.,\u00a0 ). Thirty\u2010four sounds were selected based on previous works (Grillon et al.,\u00a0 ; Hirano et al.,\u00a0 ; Kumar, Forster, Bailey, & Griffiths,\u00a0 ; Zald, Hagen, & Pardo,\u00a0 ) and on a survey that we conducted on a separate group of 87 participants. According to our survey, the sounds were globally perceived as mildly stressful, uncomfortable, and unpleasant. \n\nDuring the training session of the present experiment, participants were first asked to estimate the maximum acceptable sound level they could bear (ranging from 80 to 95\u2009dB). This maximum acceptable sound level was later set in the fMRI. They were then exposed to the 34 different sounds. Each participant evaluated these sounds (7\u2010s duration each) by rating them on a scale from 0 (not aversive) to 10 (highly aversive). Based on the individual ratings, the 17 most unpleasant sounds were selected for each participant to be further presented during the MRI session. The 17 sounds played during the experiment were rated at 7.42 on average across all the participants. Following this, participants were trained to associate \u201csafe\u201d (no aversive sounds) and \u201cthreat\u201d (aversive sounds) conditions with colored screens, that is, blue screen and red screen, respectively. During the safe condition, participants had nothing to do except quietly watching the blue colored screen. During the threat condition, participants had to pay attention to several unpleasant loud sounds while watching the red screen. \n\nIn the MRI scanner, participants were informed that they would be exposed to unpredictable aversive loud sounds, among those they rated as the most unpleasant, during either active or rest blocks. The onset of sounds was unknown to participants in order to maintain a continuous threat (Grillon et al.,\u00a0 ; Zald & Pardo,\u00a0 ). The aversive sounds occurred randomly during all cognitive tasks and rest conditions and were noncontingent upon the performance of the participant to the task. Each of the 17 aversive sounds was presented once to the participant to prevent habituation. They could be played one time or two consecutive times (without pause between the two occurrences), and never occurred again later in the experiment. The sounds were played via MR\u2010compatible monitor headphones in stereo mode. \n\n\n### n\u2010back task \n  \nThe Toulouse n\u2010back Task (TNT) was implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks) using the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions (Brainard,\u00a0 ; Kleiner, Brainard, & Pelli,\u00a0 ; Pelli & Vision,\u00a0 ). The task is described in detail in a previous publication (Mandrick et al.,\u00a0 ). The task was developed to combine a classical n\u2010back task with mental arithmetic. Instead of memorizing and comparing unique items, as in the classical n\u2010back task, the participants had to memorize and to compare the results of arithmetic operations, computed beforehand. Arithmetic operations were either additions or subtractions. All numbers were multiples of five (e.g., 15\u2009+\u200940, 90\u201335). The arithmetic operations (trials) were presented for 2.5\u00a0s, followed by an interstimulus\u2010interval of 0.5\u00a0s. Volunteers were required to compute the result of the arithmetic operations and compare it with either a fixed number (0\u2010back) or the result obtained two trials before (2\u2010back). In the 0\u2010back condition, the \u201ctarget\u201d fixed number was \u201c50.\u201d Participants were therefore asked to press a specific button when the result of the operation was 50. In the 2\u2010back condition, the participants were asked to press the button whenever the result of the arithmetic operation was identical to the one presented two trials ago (\u201cmatch\u201d), see Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nExperimental design. (a) Toulouse n\u2010back task (TNT). The active blocks consisted of 12 trials and lasted 36\u00a0s. They were interleaved with 24\u2010s rest blocks (R). Participants responded to targets and nontargets by pressing one of two different buttons. The side of the buttons was counterbalanced across participants. (b) experimental timeline. The experiment included five functional runs (two safe runs without any sounds and three threat runs with the possible occurrence of aversive sounds), presented in a counterbalanced order. TNT difficulty levels (0\u2010back and 2\u2010back) were counterbalanced and alternated with rest periods. Unpredictable aversive loud sounds were presented randomly during threat runs and could occur during rest and active blocks \n  \n\n### Procedure \n  \nThe entire protocol lasted approximately 3\u00a0hr. Before scanning, participants performed the training session, during which they were exposed to the auditory stressors further used in the MRI. They were also trained on the TNT for the two levels of task difficulty, that is, 0\u2010back and 2\u2010back. This cognitive training included at least one block for the 0\u2010back condition and three blocks for the 2\u2010back condition, until participants felt comfortable with the TNT. Furthermore, the training was successively performed in both the safe and the threat conditions. In the MRI, the TNT was presented using a video projector on a translucent screen placed above the head of the participant. He or she viewed the stimuli through a mirror mounted on the head coil above their eyes. Head movement was restricted using foam cushions. All participants underwent five functional runs (apart from two participants, who performed only four runs due to technical problems). The five functional runs consisted of two safe runs and three threat runs with the possible occurrence of aversive sounds, see Figure\u00a0 . We chose to design a within\u2010subject study (all the participants underwent safe and aversive conditions with concomitant n\u2010back task). Indeed, we expected rather large intersubject variability in cognitive performance on the complex n\u2010back calculation task (Mandrick et al.,\u00a0 ). Therefore, comparing TNT performance in two groups of participants with a between\u2010subject design may have confounded our results regarding stress effects on cognition. Moreover, similar studies have been previously conducted with no visible effect of stress persistence across stressful and safe alternate sessions (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Cousijn et al.,\u00a0 ). The order of the safe and threat runs was counterbalanced across participants. Half of the participants started each run with the 0\u2010back level and the other half with the 2\u2010back level. The TNT was presented with a blocked design. Each functional run included 12\u2009cycles of alternating 0\u2010back and 2\u2010back 36\u2010s active blocks interleaved by 24\u2010s rest blocks. Within each active block, a series of 12 arithmetic operations (trials) were presented to the participant. The participant was given a 2\u2010button response box (one button for \u201ctarget,\u201d the other for \u201cno target\u201d) and was asked to respond as quickly as possible. Each active block contained four targets in random positions. Active blocks were preceded by an instruction cue lasting 6\u00a0s. The instruction cue informed the participant about the next n\u2010back level (0\u2010back or 2\u2010back) and the screen color background indicated whether it will be a safe (blue screen) or a threat (red screen) condition. The color was not visible during the active blocks, arithmetic operations were displayed in the center of a gray background. During the rest blocks, \u201c00 + 00\u201d operations were presented and the participant did not give any response. The MRI scanning session lasted about 1\u00a0hr and 15\u2009min. \n\n\n###  MRI   data acquisition \n  \nMRI data were acquired on a Philips Achieva 3\u2010T scanner (Philips, Best, The Netherlands) at the Toulouse Neuroimaging Center technical platform (referred to as ToNIC Inserm UMR 1214), using a 32\u2010element SENSE head coil. Each of the five functional runs included successive acquisitions of 285 whole\u2010brain T2*\u2010weighted echo planar images with blood oxygenation level\u2010dependent contrast (EPI\u2010BOLD) sequence [40 axial slices with ascending acquisition order, repetition time (TR)\u00a0=\u00a02.60\u00a0s, echo time (TE)\u00a0=\u00a030\u2009ms, 90\u00b0 flip angle, matrix size\u00a0=\u00a096\u2009\u00d7\u200996, slice\u2010thickness\u00a0=\u00a03\u2009mm with no slice gap, field of view (FOV) 240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009mm ]. In addition to the five functional runs, each participant also underwent a high\u2010resolution 3D anatomical scan for functional overlay and stereotaxic transformation. This scan was acquired using a T1\u2010weighted 3D magnetization\u2010prepared rapid gradient\u2010echo (MP\u2010RAGE) sequence (TR\u00a0=\u00a08.1\u00a0ms, TE\u00a0=\u00a03.7\u00a0ms, 8\u00b0 flip\u2010angle, 170 contiguous sagittal slices with matrix size 240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240, FOV 240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009170\u2009mm ). \n\n\n### Autonomic nervous system measures in the   MRI  \n  \nFor heart rate measures, the ECG signal was recorded continuously at 500\u2009Hz throughout MRI scanning with an MR\u2010compatible pulse oximeter (Philips, Best, The Netherlands) attached to the left index finger. Moreover, the pupil diameter of the left eye was recorded continuously with an MR\u2010compatible eye\u2010tracking device (long\u2010range optic ASL EyeTracker 6000, Applied Science Laboratories, Bedford, Massachusetts) at a sampling rate of 60\u2009Hz. The eye\u2010tracker was positioned behind the scanner and the translucent screen. A hole with a radius of 3\u00a0cm was made at the bottom of the screen so that the camera could monitor the subject's eye on the mirror and the infrared light emitter could illuminate the pupil to assess its size. \n\n\n### Subjective ratings of task difficulty and anxiety \n  \nA debriefing session was conducted after MRI scanning. Participants were asked to rate the difficulty of the TNT task and the level of anxiety induced by task difficulty and by the threat of the aversive sounds. The rating was done on a 0\u201310 scale. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Behavioral data \n  \nThe mean percentage of correctly reported match/no\u2010match response (corresponding to performance success) and the mean reaction times were calculated for each participant and in each of the four experimental conditions. In addition, d\u2010prime was calculated as   z  (hit rate)\u2009\u2212\u2009  z  (false alarm rate). The three variables were analyzed across participants using repeated\u2010measures 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 ANOVA with factors of cognitive load (0\u2010back, 2\u2010back) and threatening context (safe, threat). \n\n\n#### Autonomic nervous system measure analysis \n  \n##### Heart rate \n  \nECG signal was first visually controlled for outliers and artifacts. Signal was processed with the \u201cfindpeaks\u201d function of MATLAB 2019. The series of R\u2013R interval times were then derived from the ECG and the mean heart rate was calculated for each active 36\u00a0s block. Hear rate was then averaged for each of the four experimental conditions. These mean values were further used as parametric modulators in fMRI first\u2010level models (see below). \n\n\n##### Pupil diameter \n  \nPupil diameter signal was processed using home\u2010made MATLAB scripts. Periods of signal loss and blinking as well as six samples before and after each signal loss period (100\u2009ms at 60\u2009Hz) were linearly interpolated. Trials where the number of interpolated samples exceeded 50%, were excluded from analyses. The signal was low\u2010passed using a 9\u2010point moving average filter. The pupil diameter was then averaged over all trials of each active 36\u2010s block, and then averaged for each of the four experimental conditions. Therefore, the mean pupil diameter values were modulated by both tonic and phasic pupil changes induced by cognitive load and/or threatening context. These mean values were further used as parametric modulators in fMRI first\u2010level models (see below). \n\n\n\n####  MRI   data preprocessing \n  \nImage preprocessing and statistical analysis were performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8) ( ). Functional images were realigned to the first volume with a six\u2010parameter rigid\u2010body transformation and the mean functional image was co\u2010registered to participant's T1\u2010weighted MR image. Functional images were corrected for slice acquisition timing. Anatomical images were then segmented based on tissue probability maps of gray matter, white matter and CSF in the standard MNI space. The deformation field used for the segmentation was applied to the T1\u2010weighted and functional images for normalization into MNI stereotactic space. Functional images were resampled into 2\u2010mm isotropic voxels. Finally, functional images were spatially smoothed by convolving with an isotropic 3D\u2010Gaussian kernel (8\u2010mm full width at half maximum). \n\n\n####  MRI   data statistical analyses \n  \n##### First\u2010level analyses \n  \nFor each participant, six experimental conditions were implemented as box\u2010car functions with an epoch length of 36\u00a0s, convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Specifically, individual models included four regressors of interest (corresponding to 0\u2010back safe, 2\u2010back safe, 0\u2010back threat, and 2\u2010back threat epochs) and two regressors of no interest corresponding to the 0\u2010back and 2\u2010back task epochs, during which aversive sounds were presented. These two latter conditions of no interest (12 blocks in total) were modeled to exclude any auditory perception effect or any potential distraction effect of sound, and to selectively tackle the effect of stress related to the expectancy of the unpredictable sounds. Rest epochs were implicitly modeled. In this first model, simple contrasts for each of the four conditions of interest were created, comparing active conditions with resting baseline. Moreover, in order to modulate condition effects by autonomic measures, two additional first\u2010level models were implemented for each participant, which consisted of the same six box\u2010car regressors with parametric modulation by either heart rate or pupil diameter. To this aim, heart rate and pupil diameter values were averaged over each 36\u2010s block (see below) and these mean values were entered as parametric modulators of each condition regressor in two separate models. Brain activity specific to each condition and co\u2010varying with either heart rate or pupil diameter could therefore be assessed. For each of the latter two models, four simple contrasts were created for modulated active conditions versus resting baseline. All first\u2010level models furthermore included high\u2010pass filtering using a cutoff of 1/128\u2009Hz, global intensity normalization and serial correlations correction using a first\u2010order autoregressive model. \n\n\n##### Second\u2010level analyses \n  \nFor group analyses, individual contrasts were entered into a random\u2010effects model, using the flexible factorial tool in SPM8. A repeated\u2010measures 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 ANOVA model was implemented, with task difficulty (two levels: 0\u2010back and 2\u2010back) and threat (two levels: safe and threat) as within\u2010subject factors. Main effects investigated brain activations (i.e., 2\u2010back >\u20090\u2010back and threat > safe) and brain deactivations (i.e., 2\u2010back <\u20090\u2010back and threat < safe) related with TNT difficulty and level of threat. Moreover, difficulty \u00d7 threat interaction effects investigated differences in brain mechanisms elicited by cognitive effort, during threat and safe conditions. We implemented 3\u00a0s\u2010level ANOVA models, using individual contrasts derived from first\u2010level analyses (a) without any parametric modulation, (b) with heart rate parametric modulation, and (c) with pupil diameter parametric modulation. In the group analysis that does not take autonomic modulation into account, activations were investigated at an initial voxel\u2010level threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 uncorrected, with an extent threshold of 10 voxels, and a cluster\u2010level threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 corrected for multiple comparisons (family wise error\u2010FWE) at the whole\u2010brain level was applied. We reported only the clusters surviving this correction for all contrasts investigated. For the complementary exploratory group analyses which included autonomic parametric modulation analyses, sensitivity was favored over specificity (Wilke,\u00a0 ). Therefore, significance was assumed at   p  \u2009<\u2009.005, uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Since we were particularly interested in ECN regions, we used SPM's small volume correction (SVC) at specific MNI coordinates in the DLPFC previously established as functionally connected to a pupil\u2010related network (DiNuzzo et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n##### Functional connectivity analysis \n  \nTask\u2010based connectivity analysis was performed using the SPM CONN toolbox ( ) to investigate changes in connectivity due to the threat of auditory stressors. For each participant, realignment parameters were entered as first\u2010level covariates, and preprocessed functional images were denoised (using standard CONN procedures) to remove unwanted motion artifacts prior to calculation of connectivity measures. A band\u2010pass filter of 0.008\u20130.09\u2009Hz was applied. ROI\u2010to\u2010ROI connectivity estimates were computed from correlations of BOLD signal between seed regions evidencing significant effects during threat with all ROIs from the CONN atlas. At the second\u2010level, differences in connectivity between threat and safe conditions were analyzed across all participants. Significant changes in connectivity due to threat were assessed at a threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. \n\n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Anxiety and task difficulty subjective ratings \n  \nThe average levels of anxiety induced by the four experimental conditions were 0.90 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a00.85) for \u201c0\u2010back safe,\u201d 1.95 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a01.28) for \u201c0\u2010back threat,\u201d 3.65 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a01.90) for \u201c2\u2010back safe,\u201d and 5.10 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a02.17) for \u201c2\u2010back threat\u201d (Figure\u00a0 , top left panel). Subjective anxiety was significantly higher in the 2\u2010back versus 0\u2010back condition [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a051.71,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a0.73] and in the threat versus safe condition [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a015.72,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a0.45]. The interaction term was also significant [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a04.75,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.042,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a0.20], with increased anxiety when threat and 2\u2010back conditions were combined. \n  \nSubjective ratings, behavioral performance and autonomic nervous system activity measures for each level of TNT difficulty (0\u2010back and 2\u2010back) and threat conditions (safe and threat),   n  \u00a0=\u00a020.

Repeated\u2010measures ANOVA showed that subjective difficulty was significantly higher in the 2\u2010back versus 0\u2010back condition [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a0133.45,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a0.88]. \n\n\n### n\u2010back performance \n  \n#### Percentage of correct responses \n  \nThe percentage of correct responses induced by the four experimental conditions were 94.44% (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a04.05) for \u201c0\u2010back safe,\u201d 94.71% (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a03.80) for \u201c0\u2010back threat,\u201d 78.70% (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a020.31) for \u201c2\u2010back safe,\u201d and 78.14% (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a020.25) for \u201c2\u2010back threat\u201d (Figure\u00a0 , middle left panel). Participants showed lower percentage of correct response with increased difficulty [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a018.33,   p\u2009<  \u00a0.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a0.49]. The threat of unpredictable auditory stressors did not impact accuracy (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.853). The interaction term was not significant (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.502). \n\n\n#### d\u2010prime \n  \nThe average d\u2010prime induced by the four experimental conditions was 2.43 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a00.22) for \u201c0\u2010back safe,\u201d 2.48 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a00.24) for \u201c0\u2010back threat,\u201d 1.63 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a00.64) for \u201c2\u2010back safe,\u201d and 1.60 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a00.55) for \u201c2\u2010back threat.\u201d Participants showed lower d\u2010prime with increased difficulty [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a0118.31,   p\u2009<  \u00a0.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a0.86]. The threat of unpredictable auditory stressors did not significantly impact d\u2010prime values (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.696). The interaction term was not significant (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.270). \n\n\n#### Reaction times \n  \nThe reaction times induced by the four experimental conditions were 1.16\u00a0s (  SD  \u00a0=\u20090.27) for \u201c0\u2010back safe,\u201d 1.27\u00a0s (  SD  \u00a0=\u20090.29) for \u201c0\u2010back threat,\u201d 1.64\u00a0s (  SD  \u00a0=\u20090.25) for \u201c2\u2010back safe,\u201d and 1.57\u00a0s (  SD  \u00a0=\u20090.35) for \u201c2\u2010back threat\u201d (Figure\u00a0 , middle right panel). Participants showed longer reaction times with increased difficulty [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a054.73,   p  \u00a0<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u2009.74]. The main effect of threat was not significant (  p  \u00a0=\u2009.528). The difficulty \u00d7 threat interaction was significant [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a07.68,   p  \u00a0=\u2009.012,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u2009.12], showing an increase of reaction times due to threat in the 0\u2010back condition and a decrease of reaction times in the 2\u2010back condition. However, HSD post hoc tests revealed no significant pairwise comparisons between threat and safe conditions. \n\n\n\n### Autonomic nervous system results \n  \n#### Heart rate \n  \nThe mean heart rate induced by the four experimental conditions was 74.42\u2009bpm (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a08.60) for \u201c0\u2010back safe,\u201d 73.49\u2009bpm (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a08.38) for \u201c0\u2010back threat,\u201d 77.31\u2009bpm (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a08.61) for \u201c2\u2010back safe,\u201d and 76.63\u2009bpm (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a08.63) for \u201c2\u2010back threat\u201d (Figure\u00a0 , bottom left panel). Participants showed a higher heart rate with increased task difficulty [  F  (1,19]\u00a0=\u00a053.69,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a0.74].

Such effects may represent regional deactivations when participants were engaged in the 2\u2010back condition. Significant deactivated clusters were observed in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC, with peaks located in BA 10/11) extending to the ventral ACC, the bilateral insula, the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), hippocampi and amygdala, and the posterior cingulate cortex.

The inverse contrast (threat < safe) revealed large\u2010extent bilateral deactivated regions induced by the threat condition. The clusters encompassed bilateral superior temporal regions (STG, including primary and secondary auditory cortices) and extended to lower parietal regions and amygdala. Deactivations were also found in the DMPFC (BA 8/9/10), the ventral ACC (32), and the VMPFC (orbitofrontal cortex, BA47). Occipital regions were also deactivated, as well as the posterior cingulate gyrus (BA 31).

We used bilateral Heschl's gyrus and amygdala atlas ROIs (from the CONN toolbox) as seeds to investigate functional connectivity with all other atlas ROIs. We then compared the connectivity strength between threat and safe conditions (irrespective of the level of task difficulty). At a threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 FDR\u2010corrected, auditory ROIs showed significant connectivity with dorsal prefrontal and parietal regions, although no significant difference in connectivity related to threat could be evidenced. Functional connectivity of amygdala regions with dorsal regions was also significant, and was increased during the threat of stressors (Figure\u00a0 ,   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 FDR\u2010corrected). More precisely, the connectivity between the right amygdala and right inferior parietal cortex (supramarginal gyrus) and the connectivity between the left amygdala and the MPFC were higher during threat (  t  \u00a0=\u00a03.04,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.007 FDR\u2010corrected for amygdala\u2010parietal and   t  \u00a0=\u00a02.24,   p  \u2009<\u2009.036 FDR\u2010corrected for amygdala\u2010prefrontal connectivity). \n  \nROI\u2010to\u2010ROI connectivity increases when comparing threat of auditory stressors and safe conditions (thresholded at   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 FDR\u2010corrected).

During expectation of auditory stressors (threat > safe), the increase of activity in several brain regions was positively correlated with heart rate and pupil diameter. Heart rate variations were notably associated with modulations of activity in the occipital lobe, hippocampus, precuneus or ventral posterior cingulate cortex (Table\u00a0 ). Pupil diameter variations under the threat condition were associated with higher dorsal prefrontal regions (BA 9/8/10) and occipital activity (Table\u00a0 ). It is worth noting that pupillary changes track cognitive workload at a fine\u2010grained level. Therefore, as mental workload induced variations in tonic pupil diameter between blocks, it would also be interesting to perform a point\u2010by\u2010point correlation analysis (i.e., at the fMRI temporal resolution) between the phasic pupillary response and brain activity. However, due to technical difficulties, the pupillary and BOLD signals were point\u2010by\u2010point synchronized only in 12 participants. A further investigation of this sub\u2010sample might reveal correlations between workload\u2010induced changes in tonic pupil diameter, phasic pupillary response, and brain activations. \n  \nBrain activations positively correlated with heart rate and pupil diameter during threat of stressors (threat > safe,   p  \u2009<\u2009.005, uncorrected) \n    \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nWe investigated the way the brain deals with an important mental workload and/or a threat situation. We speculated that our TNT n\u2010back task with additional cognitive workload (mental calculation) would deteriorate under high workload and we expected greater involvement of the ECN regions. Overall, the slight decrease in performance indicated that task difficulty actually increased mental workload and provoked an enhanced activity in the ECN, in particular the lateral prefrontal and parietal regions, along with a disengagement of the DMN, including the medial prefrontal cortex. Task difficulty also clearly affected subjective difficulty and autonomic activity with increased heart rate and pupillary diameter. \n\nWe expected a moderate decrease of performance with the stressors, and a large decrease of performance related to the ECN disengagement when high task difficulty was combined with the stressors. This scenario turned out to be wrong despite increased subjective anxiety with threat. Preservation of performance under threat might be due to efficient cognitive strategies used by participants, as indexed by important changes in brain activity that accompanied the threat condition: an increase of the activity in the ECN regions (lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices) along with deactivation in SN regions (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus), as in the study by Clarke and Johnstone\u00a0( ). We also found large deactivations of the superior temporal regions, suggesting attentional filtering mechanism of the aversive stimuli. When high workload was combined with the stressors, we found a pattern quite similar to those observed with the high workload, with extra activation in the ECN regions along with deactivation of the VMPFC. \n\n### Increased mental workload was associated with reduced performance, higher   ECN   activity, and increased autonomic response \n  \nOur behavioral results indicated that increased mental workload was associated with a decrease in n\u2010back task accuracy and an increase in reaction times. Our extremely difficult task elicited activity in the fronto\u2010parietal network, including the DLPFC, the dorsal ACC, and the parietal cortex. These regions are part of the ECN (Shenhav et al.,\u00a0 ), which is considered to be more activated when an individual must perform a task demanding effort, sustained attention or maintenance of information in WM, and is less activated when performing more habitual behaviors (Shenhav et al.,\u00a0 ). ECN involvement has been notably reported during n\u2010back tasks (Jansma, Ramsey, Coppola, & Kahn,\u00a0 ; Luo et al.,\u00a0 ; Schmidt et al.,\u00a0 ). In our study, a large recruitment of the SMA and the premotor cortex (BA 6) was also found with increased load in WM. SMA is considered to be a modality independent circuitry sustaining WM processes (Schumacher et al.,\u00a0 ). This region was also markedly activated during n\u2010back performance in the Schmidt et al.\u00a0( ) study. Moreover, the SMA and premotor cortex have been associated with mental calculation (Hanakawa et al.,\u00a0 ). In our 2\u2010back TNT condition, participants had to compute an exact arithmetic result to compare it with the target obtained two trials before. In the 0\u2010back condition that implied to compare the arithmetic result with \u201c50,\u201d it is likely that estimating the order of magnitude of the result was sufficient to complete the task. Accordingly, higher workload in our task resulted in increased activation of motor and ECN regions (Gruber et al.,\u00a0 ), that is, an extended fronto\u2010parietal network. \n\nBesides ECN involvement, several cortical areas owning to the DMN (Fransson & Marrelec,\u00a0 ; Greicius et al.,\u00a0 ; Raichle et al.,\u00a0 ; Ward et al.,\u00a0 ) showed large deactivations in response to increased mental effort, including the medial PFC (i.e., DMPFC and VMPFC), the PCC, the ventral ACC, and the middle temporal gyrus. The DMN, active during awake rest, would be implicated in the generation of spontaneous task\u2010unrelated thoughts (Mason et al.,\u00a0 ) whose occurrence can represent a source of internal distraction (Hinds et al.,\u00a0 ). It has been shown that regions involved in the DMN could also evidence increased activity when the task is too difficult, reflecting a disengagement from the task (Buckner, Andrews\u2010Hanna, & Schacter,\u00a0 ). Greater involvement of the DMN can thus negatively affect the performance of a demanding task (Smallwood, Beach, Schooler, & Handy,\u00a0 ), including driving a vehicle (Gal\u00e9ra et al.,\u00a0 ; He, Becic, Lee, & McCarley,\u00a0 ) or flying a plane (Casner & Schooler,\u00a0 ; Durantin, Dehais, & Delorme,\u00a0 ). In our study, regions owning to the SN were also deactivated with task difficulty, in particular the amygdala and the insula. Taken together, our data, therefore, suggest efficient allocation of neural resources to the ECN at the expense of the DMN and the SN, that is, efficient brain mechanisms to perform the complex 2\u2010back task. \n\nRegarding autonomic measures, heart rate and pupil diameter were increased during the 2\u2010back condition, indicating physiological arousal with a shift of the balance of the autonomic nervous system toward a sympathetic dominance (Simpson et al.,\u00a0 ). High workload activated the dorsal brainstem, which may reflect additional locus coeruleus (LC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) nuclei involvement. LC and VTA phasic response may have induced transient increases in catecholamine levels, thereby enhancing DLPFC activity and facilitating executive and WM processes to maintain performance to respond to increased task difficulty (Arnsten,\u00a0 ; Sara,\u00a0 ; Yuen et al.,\u00a0 ). In addition, an increase of catecholamine brain levels induces stimulation of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system (Sara & Bouret,\u00a0 ). Our observation of higher heart rate and pupil size in the 2\u2010back trials is therefore consistent with phasic catecholamine release. \n\n\n### Task performance was preserved despite the stressors:   SN   disengagement and inhibition of the auditory processing \n  \nThe threat condition resulted in significantly higher anxiety ratings, although it did not elicit significant behavioral or autonomic modifications. Preservation of performance under stressors in our complex WM task is coherent with several previous studies that have used single\u2010letter\u2010 or digit\u2010n\u2010back tasks (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Cousijn et al.,\u00a0 ; Duncko et al.,\u00a0 ; Porcelli et al.,\u00a0 ; Qin et al.,\u00a0 ) as well as similar highly demanding WM task (Mandrick et al.,\u00a0 ). Our neuroimaging results suggest that maintaining performance under stress induction was likely conditioned by additional allocation of neural resources within the ECN toward the cognitive task (Eysenck & Calvo,\u00a0 ; Mandrick et al.,\u00a0 ), inhibition of the STG to reduce auditory stressor processing, and inhibition of limbic regions of the SN for emotional regulation. \n\nThe threat condition was dominated by significant deactivations in the STG and cuneus, extending to the posterior cingulate gyrus. Deactivations were also observed in the dorsal and ventral medial PFC, the ACC, the insula and the amygdala. Deactivation of the STG most certainly reflects inhibition of auditory processing during the expectation of aversive loud sounds. Deactivation of brain regions has been probably under\u2010considered in the past because of the inclination to deal primarily with the neural activation effects induced by stimulation, rather than with any possible decrements in neural activity. Yet, it is well known that humans have the capacity to selectively enhance or inhibit sensory brain regions via top\u2010down attentional mechanisms (Mozolic et al.,\u00a0 ). Our result may thus be interpreted in several ways. First, the focal task (i.e., the TNT) may have consumed most attentional resources, provoking a reduced distractor effect (Hu, Bauer, Padmala, & Pessoa,\u00a0 ) since attention was shifted away from the aversive auditory stimuli (Pessoa, McKenna, Gutierrez, & Ungerleider,\u00a0 ). Consequently, less attention was paid to \u201cexpect\u201d and to process the sounds. An additional and more cognitively active explanation is that inhibition of auditory processing may have contributed to filter the unwanted noises. Interestingly, top\u2010down inhibitory mechanisms have been proposed to explain the attenuation of unpleasant sounds in the context of tinnitus habituation (Rauschecker, Leaver, & M\u00fchlau,\u00a0 ). Such selective sensory inhibition is thought to take place over long periods of time and following repetitive aversive stimulation. Although this long\u2010term neural adaptation could not occur in our experiment, it is possible that similar initial control mechanisms helped to protect from its stressful effects. Note, however, that the useful deactivations of large temporal regions are to be interpreted within a specific context, since \u201cignoring\u201d a stressful stimulus is not always a good strategy. When extreme, this phenomenon has been described as inattentional deafness and is subtended by inhibitory brain mechanisms of the auditory processing (Dehais, Roy, & Scannella,\u00a0 ; Giraudet, St\u2010Louis, Scannella, & Causse,\u00a0 ). While it may be useful when the aversive auditory stimulus is an unwanted disturbance, it becomes dangerous when it is a security alarm that is ignored. This points to the complexity of using physiological measures to assist the operator, and the need to go deeper into the understanding of these mechanisms. \n\nFurthermore, several regions of the SN (and in particular the VMPFC, anterior insula, and amygdala) were deactivated during the threat condition, as observed in other studies (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Pruessner et al.,\u00a0 ; Simpson et al.,\u00a0 ), suggesting implication of emotional regulation mechanisms during threat. Consistent with the latter interpretation, the functional connectivity between dorsal prefrontal/parietal regions and amygdala was increased during the threat condition. In rodents, the MPFC and amygdala have a major role in stress\u2010related behaviors, and MPFC has an important role in the regulation of amygdala response to emotional stimuli (Andolina, Maran, Valzania, Conversi, & Puglisi\u2010Allegra,\u00a0 ). Such regulation mechanisms through top\u2010down control exerted by the PFC on the amygdala have been reported in humans, during concurrent cognitive and emotional tasks (Loos et al.,\u00a0 ; for review see Okon\u2010Singer, Hendler, Pessoa, & Shackman,\u00a0 ). Consistently, our functional connectivity results suggest that, in our experiment, top\u2010down control on SN regions may have occurred during threat of stressors. In particular, the deactivation of the anterior insula may explain the absence of visible effects of the threat condition on heart rate and pupil size measures, despite self\u2010report of increased anxiety. \n\nWhen stressors were concomitant with high workload, performance remained preserved. We observed that deactivation of the VMPFC was greater (i.e., negative interaction effect). Therefore, deactivation of this region may be critical for optimal cognitive performance when facing both high load context and the threat of stressors. Bilateral hippocampus deactivations can be also linked to decreased activity in the SN. Previous studies found that the SN plays a critical role in mediating the interaction between emotion perception and executive control (Luo et al.,\u00a0 ). Moreover, we observed supplementary activity in the SMA, in the DLPFC, as well as in the left parietal cortex (i.e., positive interaction effect). These regions were also implicated in the TNT performance in the safe condition. This increased brain activity in task related regions suggests that additional cognitive resources were engaged to preserve performance. Similar increases of activity in the ECN regions under stressors were found in previous studies (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Porcelli et al.,\u00a0 ) and arithmetic tasks (Dedovic et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nInterestingly, we found that activity in dorsal medial and lateral PFC regions was related with pupil dilation under stress induction. Pupil dilation dynamics has been closely associated with LC activity (both tonic and phasic, Joshi, Li, Kalwani, & Gold,\u00a0 ) and may be a reliable proxy measure of norepinephrine (NE) release and sympathetic involvement. Activity in the dorsal frontal gyrus was found to be related with pupil size during rest (DiNuzzo et al.,\u00a0 ), thus reflecting variations of tonic NE brain levels. Therefore, in our study, pupil dilation likely indexed the increased activity in the dorsal PFC regions implicated in the cognitive task and enhanced under the threat of the stressors, as a result of a tonic increase in brain catecholamines. \n\nAltogether, our results showed that facing high load context and the threat of stressors could be characterized by a specific pattern of PFC activity. Increased activation of the ECN would play a role for the maintenance of cognitive performance, while diminishing sensory processing. This would be explained by exhaustion of attentional resources or inhibition, that helped modulating the impact of the auditory stressors. Without being contradictory to these mechanisms, successful preservation of performance may have been possible in our experiment since actual stress level was probably relatively moderate, as inferred from anxiety ratings (i.e., 5.10 in the \u201c2\u2010back threat\u201d condition, on a 0\u201310 scale) and the lack of increased sympathetic activity, in particular the heart rate that is known to be sensitive to acute stress (Yao et al.,\u00a0 ). It has been shown that passive exposure to loud aversive sounds induces significant activations in the SN and dorsal brainstem, thus clearly evidencing a marked stress response (Zald & Pardo,\u00a0 ). However, the threat of intermittent aversive sounds, as used in our study, may have been less stressful than direct exposure to permanent sounds, but we aimed at eliminating possible distraction effects. One must acknowledge that despite the subjective and neuroimaging results that suggest efficient cognitive strategies, the lack of behavioral and physiological effects of the stressor can raise a doubt on the effectiveness of the stress manipulation. Indeed, an intense level of stress would have probably provoked an increased level of emotional arousal indexed by a heightened autonomic nervous system activity. We can also postulate that a more efficient and intense stressor would have degraded task performance and elicited different patterns of brain activations, in particular with the recruitment of regions pertaining to the SN. \n\n\n### How far do we need to go to observe cognitive disengagement? \n  \nCompared with previous studies on concomitant cognitive task and acute stress, our primary goal was to increase the mental effort with a task that combined WM and mental calculation, two cognitive processes that rely on the ECN. We did not observe a drop of performance or a decrease in ECN function when combined with stress. There are three ways to induce cognitive disengagement in such experimental design: increasing the load, increasing the stress or increasing both of them. The increase of the cognitive load is limited: the task would have to be hardly feasible without stress and become unfeasible when stress is administered. We think that this ceiling of difficulty might have been reached with the very difficult TNT. However, participants did adapt with the threat of aversive sounds, and performance at the task was similar with and without stress. Increasing the level or changing the nature of stress, may therefore, in this context, be the solution. Given the mentioned low efficiency (and possibly zero efficiency in some participants) of the threat of aversive sounds, for future experiments, we would suggest turning to other types of stressors. For example, psychosocial stress is difficult to filter out, contrarily to auditory stressors, and have been proven to reduce performance (Jiang & Rau,\u00a0 ; Schoofs et al.,\u00a0 ). These scenarios are not easy to implement in an fMRI experiment because to be efficient, they must be very realistic. This would be however a great challenge and an interesting path that may well fit with the high levels of stress that airplane pilots experience due to high hierarchical pressure, huge financial outcomes, and even life and death responsibility. \n\nIt is also important to note that experimental 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 designs combining factors of workload and stress, such as used in our and others' studies (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Cousijn et al.,\u00a0 ; Duncko et al.,\u00a0 ; Jiang & Rau,\u00a0 ; Porcelli et al.,\u00a0 ; Qin et al.,\u00a0 ; Schoofs et al.,\u00a0 ), remain approximate to selectively point out effects of stress on cognition. Indeed, cognitive task difficulty itself can induce acute stress. In our study, both levels of subjective difficulty and anxiety were increased by higher task load, and one might argue that task\u2010related stress might have participated in the observed shift toward sympathetic dominance. Indeed, increased workload in a challenging task can elicit a mixture of mental workload and acute stress since the task can be emotionally challenging (Parent et al.,\u00a0 ). Raised anxiety related to task performance was evidenced by Simpson et al.\u00a0( ). The authors assumed that anxiety is a likely accompaniment of most demanding cognitive tasks conducted in a laboratory or imaging settings, especially during na\u00efve task performance. As a consequence, areas of the brain concerned with emotion may change in concert with those more directly concerned with the cognitive aspects of the tasks. However, in our study, brain regions related to the 2\u2010back condition largely suggest that task\u2010related stress remained moderate as no clear activation of the SN was evidenced. Conversely, the opposite pattern was observed, that is, deactivation of the SN. \n\n\n### Perspectives for neuroergonomics \n  \nComplex and safety\u2010critical activities such as piloting can lead to an increase of both mental workload and acute stress, whose effects can engender poor cognitive performance, bad decisions (Maier, Makwana, & Hare,\u00a0 ), and eventually accidents. In this context, the maintenance of optimal cognitive performance is a constant challenge. Here we observed that high load context and the threat of stressors may be overcome thanks to compensatory mechanisms. The balance of high activity in the ECN combined with reduced activity in the SN and the DMN were markers of efficient brain mechanisms and preserved performance. Conversely, with more load and more intense stress, the disruption of this balance may be used as a marker of cognitive disengagement and disability to appropriately face an emergency. As in situ measurements of mental workload are expanding rapidly with the development of field\u2010deployable neuroimaging tools like functional Near\u2010Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), caution must be taken, especially when safety\u2010related decisions are supported by physiological objective measurements. Our results confirmed that increased activity in the DLPFC, belonging to the dorsal fronto\u2010parietal network, successfully indexed effortful (but efficient) mental activity. This effortful mental activity was accompanied by a reduction of the DMN activations, including the DMPFC. During combined high workload and threat of stressors, greater deactivations were observed in the VMPFC. Using frontal fNIRS, the DLPFC/medial PFC cerebral blood flow ratio could thus efficiently index mental workload and emotional regulation. \n\nRegarding autonomic measures, increased heart rate and pupil diameter in the more demanding task confirmed that variations in heart rate and pupil diameter can be reliable indexes of mental workload during task performance. This is consistent with a large body of literature (Kahneman & Beatty,\u00a0 ; Shine et al.,\u00a0 ; van der Wel & van Steenbergen,\u00a0 ), including studies addressing critical domains like piloting (Peysakhovich et al.,\u00a0 ; Roscoe,\u00a0 ; Wilson,\u00a0 ). Among promising applications, we can cite the evaluation of systems during the certification process via the objective evaluation of the mental workload and stress they can generate, adaptive automation (Byrne & Parasuraman,\u00a0 ), crew monitoring in the cockpit, or driver monitoring in autonomous vehicles. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nOur results have highlighted the cerebral and physiological signature of high mental workload and threat of auditory stressors. Mental workload was characterized by a marked activation of the ECN along with disengagement of the DMN and SN. Cardiovascular activity and pupillary diameter were good indicators of mental workload, with possible links between pupil diameter variations and superior frontal activity. Threat of auditory stressors did not result in changes in autonomic activity or task performance but increased recruitment of task\u2010related regions (in particular the ECN, with lateral prefrontal and parietal regions, as well as the SMA), decreased activation of the medial PFC, and deactivation of auditory and SN regions were observed, suggesting adaptive brain mechanisms to focus on the task and inhibit processing of the stressors and regulate emotion. During concomitant high workload and stressors, we observed a similar pattern with higher recruitment of task\u2010related regions and decreased activation of the medial PFC. \n\nOur results critically underline that extra recruitment of task\u2010related regions, in particular in the lateral prefrontal and parietal regions, and a pattern of PFC activations/deactivations, that is, increased lateral PFC and decreased medial PFC activity, may represent a relevant marker of preserved performance and successful management of both high load and threat of stressors. We can however assume that stress levels were moderate in our experiment and more intense stress may have finally resulted in different patterns of activations and a performance decrement. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8764488, "text_md5": "b1cdd791f0fe6b924ba0a1263097982f", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 140], "journal": [141, 155], "publication_year": [157, 161], "title": [172, 241], "keywords": [255, 348], "abstract": [361, 2542], "body": [2551, 70577]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 34738280, "doi": "10.1002/hbm.25703", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8764488", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8764488"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8764488\">8764488</a>", "list_title": "PMC8764488  Facing successfully high mental workload and stressors: An fMRI study"}

The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that minor issues remain unresolved ( ). \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe human voice is a critical social stimulus in children\u2019s environment, and engaging with vocal sounds is important for language ( ;  ) and social-emotional learning ( ) during typical development. However, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often not responsive to voices ( ;  ), and it has been hypothesized that voice processing deficits contribute to pronounced social communication difficulties in ASD ( ;  ;  ). A special case of voice processing impairments in children with ASD is a deficit in processing mother\u2019s voice ( ), a biologically\u00a0salient and implicitly rewarding sound for typically developing (TD) children ( ;  ), which is closely associated with cognitive ( ;  ) and social development ( ;  ). Compared to studies of visual face processing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), very little is known regarding the neurobiology of voice processing networks in children with ASD, which is fundamental to human communication. \n\nIt remains unknown why children with ASD often do not engage with the voices in their environment. Specifically, it is not known which aspects of voice processing are impaired in children with ASD. One possibility is that sensory deficits negatively affect voice processing and contribute to social communication deficits ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). A second possibility relates to the motivation to engage with socially\u00a0relevant stimuli ( ;  ;  ;  ). The social motivation theory of ASD posits that impairments in representing the reward value of human vocal sounds impedes individuals with ASD from engaging with these stimuli, and contributes to social interaction difficulties ( ;  ). While this is a prominent model for considering social communication function in ASD, there has been a dearth of compelling experimental evidence showing aberrant reward processing in response to clinically meaningful social stimuli ( ). \n\nAn important approach for testing theories of ASD is the use of human brain imaging methods and functional circuit analyses. Behavioral studies are limited in their ability to provide details regarding the neural mechanisms underlying distinct aspects of social information processing, and systems neuroscience analyses can uncover important aspects of social information processing that may be impaired in individuals with ASD. For example, the social motivation theory posits that individuals with ASD show reduced engagement and connectivity in the mesolimbic reward system, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and structures of the salience and affective processing systems, instantiated in the anterior insula and amygdala, during social processing ( ). \n\nPrevious brain imaging research of voice processing in adults with ASD has supported the sensory deficit model by showing reduced regional activity in voice-selective superior temporal sulcus (STS) ( ;  ), a core region associated with structural analysis of the human voice ( ). However, several factors have precluded thorough tests of prominent ASD theories in the context of the neurobiology of voice processing. First, there have been few studies examining voice processing in ASD, particularly when compared to the extensive face processing literature ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Second, previous studies have not employed biologically\u00a0salient voices (e.g. mother/caregiver), which are thought to be implicitly rewarding ( ), to probe brain circuit function in children with ASD. For example, a recent study in TD children showed that, compared to unfamiliar voices, mother\u2019s voice elicits activation within voice-selective, mesolimbic reward, affective, and salience, and face-processing brain regions, and connectivity between these regions predicts social communication abilities ( ). Third, previous studies of voice processing have focused on group differences in brain activity between individuals with ASD and matched controls but have not examined how individual variation in social communication abilities are associated with social brain circuit function in ASD. Finally, although autism has been conceptualized as a disorder of brain connectivity ( ;  ), previous brain imaging studies of human voice processing in ASD have focused on regional activation profiles in voice-selective cortex ( ;  ) and have not employed a brain networks perspective. Importantly, a brain networks approach goes beyond describing activation in circumscribed brain regions and accounts for the coordinated activity in distributed brain systems during social information processing, and would provide considerable insight into aberrancies in several critical brain systems in ASD ( ;  ;  ). For example, a previous resting state fMRI study investigated intrinsic connectivity of voice-selective cortex and showed that children with ASD have reduced connectivity between voice-selective STS and key structures of the mesolimbic reward system, anterior insula, and amygdala ( ). Moreover, the strength of intrinsic connectivity in this network predicted social communication abilities in children with ASD. While intrinsic network findings support the social motivation theory of ASD, a critical question remains: do results from intrinsic connectivity reflect an epiphenomenon, or is aberrant brain connectivity in voice and reward brain systems during the processing of biologically\u00a0salient and clinically\u00a0relevant voices a signature of social communication deficits in children with ASD? \n\nHere, we examine social information processing in children with ASD by probing brain circuit function and connectivity in response to human vocal sounds. We examined two aspects of voice processing: (1) unfamiliar voice processing compared to non-social auditory processing (i.e. environmental sounds) and (2) mother\u2019s voice compared to unfamiliar voice processing ( ). The rationale for this approach is that these two levels of social information processing may reflect distinct neural signatures in voice-selective, salience, and reward processing brain systems in children with ASD. A key aspect of our analysis was to investigate whether brain activity and connectivity in response to these vocal contrasts reflects individual differences in social communication abilities in children with ASD ( ). A second aspect of the analysis was to build on results from a previous intrinsic connectivity study of the voice processing network in children with ASD ( ) to examine whether stimulus-evoked connectivity patterns within this network during unfamiliar and mother\u2019s voice processing can reliably distinguish children with ASD from TD children and predict social communication abilities in children with ASD. \n   fMRI Experimental design, acoustical analysis, and behavioral results.  \n(  A  ) Randomized, rapid event-related design: During fMRI data collection, three auditory nonsense words, produced by three different speakers, were presented to the child participants at a comfortable listening level. The three speakers consisted of each child\u2019s mother and two control voices. Non-speech environmental sounds were also presented to enable baseline comparisons for the speech contrasts of interest. All auditory stimuli were 956 ms in duration and were equated for RMS amplitude. (  B  ) Acoustical analyses show that vocal samples produced by the participants\u2019 mothers were comparable between TD (yellow) and ASD groups (magenta) and were similar to the control samples (cyan) for individual acoustical measures (p>0.10 for all acoustical measures; see Appendix,   Acoustical analysis of mother\u2019s voice samples  ). (  C  ) All TD children and the majority of children with ASD were able to identify their mother\u2019s voice with high levels of accuracy, however five children with ASD performed below chance on this measure (see Appendix,   Identification of Mother\u2019s Voice  ). The horizontal line represents chance level for the mother\u2019s voice identification task. \n  \n\n## Results \n  \n### TD vs. ASD activation differences in response to unfamiliar voices \n  \nDirect group comparisons between TD children and children with ASD in response to unfamiliar female voices show that children with ASD have reduced activity in a relatively small set of brain regions confined to lateral temporal cortex ( ; see   for effect sizes and   for within-group results). Specifically, children with ASD show reduced activity in right hemisphere planum polare (PP), an area of auditory association cortex within the superior temporal gyrus. Within-group signal level analysis showed that TD children have greater activity for unfamiliar female voices, compared to environmental sounds, in this brain region (i.e. positive \u03b2s; see  ) while children with ASD show weaker activity for this same contrast (i.e. negative \u03b2s for unfamiliar voices compared to environmental sounds). No brain regions showed greater activity for unfamiliar female voices in the ASD, compared to the TD, group. \n   Brain activity difference in TD children compared to children with ASD in response to vocal stimuli.  \n(  A  ) Group comparisons indicate that TD children show greater activity compared to children with ASD in right-hemisphere auditory association cortex (planum polare (PP)) in response to the unfamiliar female voices\u00a0>\u00a0non-vocal environmental sound contrast. No regions showed greater activity in children with ASD compared to TD children for the unfamiliar female voice contrast. (  B  ) Group comparisons indicate that TD children show greater activity in several visual processing regions, including bilateral intercalcarine cortex, lingual gyrus, and fusiform cortex, as well as right-hemisphere posterior hippocampus and superior parietal regions, in response to the mother\u2019s voice\u00a0>\u00a0unfamiliar female voices contrast. No regions showed greater activity in children with ASD compared to TD children for the mother\u2019s voice contrast. \n  \n\n### TD vs. ASD activation differences in response to mother\u2019s voice \n  \nDirect group comparisons between brain responses measured from TD children and children with ASD in response to mother\u2019s voice relative to unfamiliar female voices revealed that children with ASD have reduced activity in several visual processing regions as well as key structures of the medial temporal lobe memory system ( ; see   for effect sizes and   for within-group results). Specifically, whole-brain analysis revealed that TD children had greater activation compared to children with ASD for mother\u2019s voice in bilateral intercalcarine cortex extending into lingual gyrus. Moreover, children with ASD showed reduced activity compared to TD children in a broad extent of fusiform gyrus bilaterally, including both left-hemisphere occipital regions of fusiform as well as temporal occipital regions in the right-hemisphere. Children with ASD also showed less activity for mother\u2019s voice in right-hemisphere posterior hippocampus, a critical region for learning and memory, as well as precuneus cortex of the default mode network. Signal level analysis shows that TD children have greater activity for mother\u2019s voice compared to unfamiliar female voices in these brain regions (i.e. positive \u03b2s; see  ) while children with ASD show weaker activity for mother\u2019s voice (i.e. negative \u03b2s). No brain structures showed greater activity for mother\u2019s voice in the ASD, compared to the TD, group. Moreover, fMRI activation profiles in children with ASD were not related to mother\u2019s voice identification accuracy (see Appendix,   fMRI activation and connectivity profiles in children with ASD are not related to mother\u2019s voice identification accuracy  ). \n\n\n### Brain activity and social\u00a0communication abilities \n  \nIdentifying sources of variance in key symptom domains represents an important question for autism research. We performed a whole-brain linear regression analysis using individual social\u00a0communication scores as a predictor of brain activation. We first examined this relation in the context of general vocal processing using the unfamiliar female voices minus environmental sounds contrast. Results from this analysis show a striking pattern: the strength of activity in a variety of brain systems serving auditory, reward, and salience detection is correlated with social\u00a0communication\u00a0abilities in children with ASD ( ; see   for effect sizes). Specifically, this pattern was apparent in auditory association cortex of the superior temporal plane, including the PP, but also in the nucleus accumbens of the reward pathway, and anterior insula of the salience network. Scatterplots show that brain activity and social\u00a0communication abilities vary across a range of values and greater social function, reflected by lower social\u00a0communication scores, is associated with greater brain activity in these auditory, reward, and salience processing regions. Support vector regression (SVR) analysis ( ;  ) showed that the strength of activity in these regions was a reliable predictor of social\u00a0communication function in these children (  R  \u00a0\u2265\u00a00.49; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.011 for all regions). \n   Activity in response to vocal stimuli and social\u00a0communication abilities in children with ASD.  \n(  A  ) In children with ASD, the whole-brain covariate map shows that social\u00a0communication scores are correlated with activity strength during unfamiliar female voice processing in auditory association cortex, the NAc of the reward system, and AI of the salience network. Scatterplots show the distributions and covariation of activity strength in response to unfamiliar female voices and standardized scores of social\u00a0communication abilities in these children. Greater social\u00a0communication abilities, reflected by smaller social\u00a0communication scores, are associated with greater brain activity in these regions. (  B  ) The whole-brain covariate map shows that social\u00a0communication scores are correlated with activity strength during mother\u2019s voice processing in primary auditory and association cortex, voice-selective STS, vmPFC of the reward system, AI and rACC of the salience network, and SMA. \n  \nWe next examined the question of heterogeneity in the context of mother\u2019s voice processing, and results show a similar pattern: children with ASD with greater social\u00a0communication abilities showed greater activation for mother\u2019s voice in a wide extent of primary auditory, auditory association, and voice-selective cortex as well as mesolimbic reward, salience detection, and motor regions ( ). Specifically, this brain-behavior relationship was evident in auditory regions of superior temporal cortex, including medial aspects of bilateral Heschl\u2019s gyrus, which contains primary auditory cortex, right-hemisphere PP of the superior temporal plane, as well as bilateral voice-selective mSTS. This relationship was also observed in regions of the salience network, including dorsal aspects of AI bilaterally and right-hemisphere rostral ACC (rACC), as well as vmPFC of the reward network. SVR results indicated that the strength of activity in these particular brain regions during mother\u2019s voice processing was a reliable predictor of social\u00a0communication function in these children (  R  \u00a0\u2265\u00a00.50; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.009 for all regions). \n\n\n### Connectivity patterns predict group membership \n  \nFunctional connectivity was examined using a generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) model within an extended voice processing brain network defined   a priori   from intrinsic connectivity results described in a previous study in children with ASD ( ) ( ). This approach allows us to systematically build upon our previous findings while preempting task and sample-related biases in region-of-interest (ROI) selection. This extended voice processing network included ROIs in voice-selective STS, structures of the reward and salience networks, amygdala, hippocampus, and fusiform cortex (see   for details of this network). There were no univariate group differences in individual links during either unfamiliar voice ( ) or mother\u2019s voice processing ( ) after correcting for multiple comparisons (FDR,   q  \u00a0<\u00a00.05). Support vector classification (SVC) results showed that multivariate connectivity patterns during unfamiliar voice processing were unable to predict group membership above chance (SVC Accuracy\u00a0=\u00a051.6%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.31); however, multivariate connectivity patterns during mother\u2019s voice processing accurately predicted TD vs. ASD group membership (SVC Accuracy\u00a0=\u00a070.4%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). We performed a confirmatory analysis using a different logistic regression classifier (GLMnet, generalized linear model via penalized maximum likelihood) and results were similar to the SVC results (unfamiliar voice processing: 54.8%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.78 (not significant); mother\u2019s voice: 80.9%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.010). These SVC results held even after accounting for group differences in mother\u2019s voice identification accuracy (see Appendix,   fMRI activation and connectivity profiles in children with ASD are not related to mother\u2019s voice identification accuracy  ). Results show that patterns of brain connectivity during biologically-salient voice processing, but not unfamiliar voice processing, can distinguish children with ASD from TD children. \n   Functional connectivity in the extended voice-selective network and TD vs.\u00a0ASD group membership.  \n(  A  ) The brain network used in connectivity analyses, which includes voice-selective, reward, salience, affective, and face-processing regions, was defined   a priori   from intrinsic connectivity results described in a previous study of children with ASD ( ). (  B-C  ) Group difference connectivity matrices shows differences in connectivity between TD children and children with ASD for all node combinations during (  B  ) unfamiliar female voice processing and (  C  ) mother\u2019s voice processing. Results from multivariate connectivity analysis show that connectivity patterns during mother\u2019s voice processing can accurately predict TD vs. ASD group membership; however, connectivity patterns during unfamiliar female voice processing are unable to accurately predict group membership. \n  \n\n### Connectivity patterns predict social\u00a0communication abilities \n  \nWe next examined the relation between connectivity beta weights in each cell of the connectivity matrix and social\u00a0communication scores in children with ASD. There were no significant univariate correlations between the strength of brain connectivity during either unfamiliar ( ) or mother\u2019s voice processing ( ) and social\u00a0communication abilities. We then performed support vector regression (SVR) to examine whether multivariate patterns of connectivity during voice processing accurately predict social\u00a0communication abilities in these children. Given that brain activation results showed that both unfamiliar ( ) and mother\u2019s voice processing ( ) explained variance in social\u00a0communication abilities, we used a combination of connectivity features from both vocal conditions for this analysis. SVR results showed that multivariate connectivity patterns during unfamiliar and mother\u2019s voice processing accurately predict social\u00a0communication scores in children with ASD (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.42, p\u00a0=\u00a00.015). We performed a confirmatory analysis using GLMnet and results were similar to the SVR results (social\u00a0communication prediction:   R  \u00a0=\u00a00.76, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Furthermore, when children with below chance accuracy on the mother\u2019s voice identification accuracy were removed from the analysis, this result held and connectivity patterns were still predictive of social\u00a0communication scores (see Appendix,   fMRI activation and connectivity profiles in children with ASD are not related to mother\u2019s voice identification accuracy  ). \n   Functional connectivity in the extended voice-selective network and social\u00a0communication abilities in children with ASD.  \n(  A  ) The brain network used in connectivity analyses, which includes voice-selective, reward, salience, affective, and face-processing regions, was defined   a priori   from intrinsic connectivity results described in a previous study of children with ASD\u00a0( ). (  B-C  ) Correlation matrices show Pearson\u2019s correlations between social\u00a0communication scores and connectivity for each pairwise node combination in response to (  B  ) unfamiliar female voice processing and (  C  ) mother\u2019s voice processing in children with ASD. Results from multivariate connectivity analysis show that using a combination of connectivity features from both unfamiliar female and mother\u2019s voice processing can accurately predict social\u00a0communication scores in children with ASD. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIt is unknown why children with ASD often \u2018tune out\u2019 from the voices of social partners in their environment ( ), including personal relations such as family members and caregivers ( ). Here, we identify a striking relationship between individuals\u2019 social communication abilities and the strength of activation in reward and salience processing brain regions, notably NAc and AI, during human voice processing in children with ASD. Multivariate connectivity patterns within an extended voice processing network distinguished children with ASD from their TD peers and predicted social communication abilities in children with ASD. These findings suggest that dysfunction of the brain\u2019s reward system provides a stable brain signature of ASD that contributes to aberrant processing of salient vocal information ( ). \n\n### Regional and network features associated with voice processing predict individual differences in social function in children with ASD \n  \nIndividuals with ASD present with a complex behavioral profile, which includes an array of sensory ( ), cognitive ( ), and affective processing differences ( ) compared to TD individuals. Consensus on the specific factors that most contribute to pronounced social communication difficulties in this population has remained elusive. Our findings showed that both regional and network features associated with voice processing, encompassing voice-selective cortex in the STS and extended voice-processing network that includes auditory, reward, and salience regions, predicted social function in children with ASD. The diversity of this network reflects the complexities of social communication itself, which involves the ability to integrate sensory, affective, mnemonic, and reward information. Importantly, our results unify several important characteristics of ASD in the extant literature, including regional functional aberrancies within specific brain systems and their association with social abilities ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), network level dysfunction ( ;  ;  ;  ), and heterogeneity of social communication abilities ( ;  ). We suggest that social communication function \u2013 human\u2019s ability to interact with and relate to others \u2013 is a unifying factor for explaining regional activation profiles and large-scale connectivity patterns linking key elements of the social brain. \n\n\n### A voice-related brain network approach for understanding social information processing in autism \n  \nBrain network analyses represent an important approach for understanding brain function in autism ( ;  ;  ;  ), and psychopathology more broadly ( ). These methods, which are typically applied to resting-state brain imaging data, have yielded considerable knowledge regarding network connectivity patterns in ASD and their links to behavior ( ). A central assumption of this approach is that aberrant task-evoked circuit function is associated with clinical symptoms and behavior; however, empirical studies examining these associations have been lacking from the ASD literature. Our study addresses this gap by probing task-evoked function within a network defined   a priori   from a previous study of intrinsic connectivity of voice-selective networks in an independent group of children with ASD. We show that voice-related network function during the processing of a clinically and biologically meaningful social stimulus predicts both ASD group membership as well as social communication abilities in these children. Our findings bridge a critical gap between the integrity of the intrinsic architecture of the voice-processing network in children with ASD and network signatures of aberrant social information processing in these individuals. \n\n\n### Biologically-salient vocal stimuli for investigating the social brain in autism spectrum disorders \n  \nOur results demonstrate that brief samples of a biologically\u00a0salient voice, mother\u2019s voice, elicit a distinct neural signature in children with ASD. Our findings have important implications for the development of social skills in children with ASD. Specifically, typically developing children prefer biologically\u00a0salient voices such as a mother\u2019s voice which provide critical cues for social ( ) and language learning ( ). In contrast, both anecdotal ( ) and experimental accounts ( ) indicate that children with ASD do not show a preference for these sounds. We suggest that aberrant function within the extended voice processing network may underlie insensitivity to biologically\u00a0salient voices in children with ASD, which may subsequently affect key developmental processes associated with social and pragmatic language learning. \n\n\n### The social motivation theory and reward circuitry in children with ASD \n  \nThe social motivation theory of ASD provides an important framework for considering pervasive social deficits in affected individuals ( ;  ). The theory posits that social skills emerge in young children from an initial attraction to social cues in their environment. For example, TD infants are highly attentive to speech despite having no understanding of words\u2019 meanings, and this early attraction to vocal cues may be a critical step in a developmental process that includes speech sound discrimination, mimicry, and, ultimately, language learning and verbal communication ( ). In contrast, children with ASD often do not engage with the speech in their environment ( ), and a central hypothesis of the social motivation theory is that weak reward attribution to vocal sounds during early childhood disrupts important developmental processes supporting social communication. \n\nOur findings provide support for the social motivation theory by showing a link between social communication abilities in children with ASD and the strength of activity in reward and salience detection systems in response to unfamiliar and mother\u2019s voice. Specifically, children with ASD who have the most severe social communication deficits have the weakest responses in reward and salience detection brain regions to both of these vocal sources. Moreover, network connectivity of an extended voice-selective network, which includes nodes of the salience and reward networks, distinguished ASD and TD children and predicted social communication abilities in children with ASD. These results are the first to show that aberrant function of reward circuitry during voice processing is a distinguishing feature of childhood autism, and may limit the ability of children with ASD to experience vocal sounds as rewarding or salient. Our findings add to a growing literature suggesting that functional connectivity between voice-selective STS and reward and salience processing regions is an important predictor of social skill development in children ( ;  ). \n\nOur results highlighting the role of reward and salience in the context of voice processing have implications for clinical treatment of social communication deficits in children with ASD. An important direction for treatment of children with ASD involves the use of teaching strategies ( ;  ) that focus on motivating children to engage in verbal interactions to improve social communication skills ( ;  ). Findings suggest that clinical efforts to increase the reward value of vocal interactions in children with ASD may be key to remediating social communication deficits in these individuals. Furthermore, neural activity and connectivity measures may represent a quantitative metric for assessing response to clinical treatments focused on verbal interactions. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThere are limitations to the current work that warrant consideration. First, the sample size is relatively modest compared to recent task-based brain imaging studies of neurotypical adult populations and resting-state fMRI or structural MRI studies in individuals with ASD, however these types of studies do not face the same data collection challenges as task-based studies in clinical pediatric populations ( ). Importantly, resting-state and structural imaging studies are unable to address specific questions related to social information processing in ASD, such as biologically\u00a0salient voice processing, which are critical for understanding the brain bases of social dysfunction in affected children. Indeed, our sample size is larger than, or comparable to, the majority of task-fMRI studies in children with ASD published since 2017, and have more stringent individual-level sampling compared to these studies. This is an important consideration given that the replicability of task fMRI data is not solely contingent on a large sample size but also depends on the amount of individual-level sampling. A recent report examining this question showed that modest sample sizes, comparable to those described in our submitted manuscript, yield highly replicable results with only four runs of task data with a similar number of trials per run as our study ( ). In comparison, we required that each child participant had at least seven functional imaging runs of our event-related fMRI task that met our strict head movement criteria. A final limitation of this work is that, consistent with the vast majority of brain imaging studies in children with ASD, we were unable to include lower functioning children with ASD since the scanner environment is ill-suited for these children ( ). Further studies with larger samples are needed both to capture the full range of heterogeneity of ASD and to ensure the broader generalizability of the findings reported here. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nWe identified neural features underlying voice processing impairments in children with ASD, which are thought to contribute to pervasive social communication difficulties in affected individuals. Results show that activity profiles and network connectivity patterns within voice-selective and reward regions, measured during unfamiliar and mother\u2019s voice processing, distinguish children with ASD from TD peers and predict their social communication abilities. These findings are consistent with the social motivation theory of ASD by linking human voice processing to dysfunction in the brain\u2019s reward centers, and have implications for the treatment of social communication deficits in children with ASD. For example, parent training has emerged as a powerful and cost-effective approach for increasing treatment intensity ( ): treatment delivery in the child\u2019s natural environment promotes functional communication ( ), generalization ( ), and maintenance of skills over time ( ;  ). Findings from the current study, which demonstrate a link between social communication function and neural processing of mother\u2019s voice, support the importance of parent training by suggesting that a child\u2019s ability to focus on, and direct neural resources to, these critical communication partners may be a key to improving social function in affected children. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe Stanford University Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol. Parental consent and the child\u2019s assent were obtained for all evaluation procedures, and children were paid for their participation in the study. \n\nA total of 57 children were recruited from around the San Francisco Bay Area for this study. All children were required to be right-handed and have a full-scale IQ\u00a0>\u00a080, as measured by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)\u00a0( ). 28 children met ASD criteria based on an algorithm ( ) that combines information from both the module 3 of the ADOS-2 (47) and the ADI\u2013Revised ( ). Specifically, these children showed mild to more severe social communication deficits, particularly in the areas of social-emotional reciprocity and verbal and non-verbal communication, and repetitive and restricted behaviors and interests ( ). Five children with ASD were excluded because of excessive movement in the fMRI scanner, one child was excluded because of a metal retainer interfering with their brain images, and one child was excluded because their biological mother was not available to do a voice recording. Importantly, children in the ASD sample are considered \u2018high-functioning\u2019 and had fluent language skills and above-average reading skills ( ). Nevertheless, these children are generally characterized as having communication impairments, especially in the area of reciprocal conversation. \n   Demographic and IQ measures      \nTD children and had no history of neurological, psychiatric, or learning disorders, personal and family history (first degree) of developmental cognitive disorders and heritable neuropsychiatric disorders, evidence of significant difficulty during pregnancy, labor, delivery, or immediate neonatal period, or abnormal developmental milestones as determined by neurologic history and examination. Three TD children were excluded because of excessive movement in the fMRI scanner, one was excluded because of scores in the \u2018severe\u2019 range on standardized measures of social function, and four female TD children were excluded to provide a similar ratio of males to females relative to the ASD participants. The final TD and ASD groups that were included in the analysis consisted of 21 children in each group who were matched for full-scale IQ, age, sex, and head motion during the fMRI scan ( ). All participants are the biological offspring of the mothers whose voices were used in this study (i.e. none of our participants were adopted, and therefore none of the mother\u2019s voices are from an adoptive mother), and all participants were raised in homes that included their mothers. Participants\u2019 neuropsychological characteristics are provided in  . \n\n\n### Data acquisition parameters \n  \nAll fMRI data were acquired at the Richard M. Lucas Center for Imaging at Stanford University. Functional images were acquired on a 3 T Signa scanner (General Electric) using a custom-built head coil. Participants were instructed to stay as still as possible during scanning, and head movement was further minimized by placing memory-foam pillows around the participant\u2019s head. A total of 29 axial slices (4.0 mm thickness, 0.5 mm skip) parallel to the anterior/posterior commissure line and covering the whole brain were imaged by using a T2*-weighted gradient-echo spiral in-out pulse sequence ( ) with the following parameters: repetition time\u00a0=\u00a03576 ms; echo time\u00a0=\u00a030 ms; flip angle\u00a0=\u00a080\u00b0; one interleave. The 3576 msec TR can be calculated as the sum of: (1) the stimulus duration of 956 msec; (2) a 300 ms silent interval buffering the beginning and end of each stimulus presentation (600 ms total of silent buffers) to avoid backward and forward masking effects; (3) the 2000 ms volume acquisition time; and (4) an additional 20 ms silent interval, which helped the stimulus computer maintain precise and accurate timing during stimulus presentation. The field of view was 20 cm, and the matrix size was 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064, providing an in- plane spatial resolution of 3.125 mm. Reduction of blurring and signal loss arising from field inhomogeneities was accomplished by the use of an automated high-order shimming method before data acquisition. \n\n\n### fMRI Task \n  \nAuditory stimuli were presented in 10 separate runs, each lasting 4 min. One run consisted of 56 trials of mother\u2019s voice, unfamiliar female voices, environmental sounds and catch trials, which were pseudo-randomly ordered within each run. Stimulus presentation order was the same for each subject. Each stimulus lasted 956 msec in duration. Prior to each run, child participants were instructed to play the \u2018kitty cat game\u2019 during the fMRI scan. While laying down in the scanner, children were first shown a brief video of a cat and were told that the goal of the cat game was to listen to a variety of sounds, including \u2018voices that may be familiar,\u2019 and to push a button on a button box only when they heard kitty cat meows (catch trials). The function of the \u2018catch trials\u2019 was to keep the children alert and engaged during stimulus presentation. During each run, four or five exemplars of each stimulus type (i.e. nonsense words samples of mother\u2019s and unfamiliar female voices, environmental sounds), as well as three catch trials, were presented. At the end of each run, the children were shown another engaging video of a cat. Although the button box failed to register responses during data collection in four children with ASD and nine TD children, data analysis of the catch trails for 17 children with ASD and 12 TD children showed similar catch trial accuracies between TD (accuracy\u00a0=\u00a091%) and ASD groups (accuracy\u00a0=\u00a089%; two-sample   t  -test results:   t  (2) = 0.35, p\u00a0=\u00a00.73). Across the ten runs, a total of 48 exemplars of each stimulus condition were presented to each subject (i.e. 144 total exemplars produced by each of the three vocal sources, including the child\u2019s mother, unfamiliar female voice #1, and unfamiliar female voice #2). Vocal\u00a0stimuli were presented to participants in the scanner using Eprime V1.0 (Psychological Software Tools, 2002). Participants wore custom-built headphones designed to reduce the background scanner noise to \u223c70 dBA ( ;  ). Headphone sound levels were calibrated prior to each data collection session, and all stimuli were presented at a sound level of 75 dBA. Participants were scanned using an event-related design. Auditory stimuli were presented during silent intervals between volume acquisitions to eliminate the effects of scanner noise on auditory discrimination. One stimulus was presented every 3576 ms, and the silent period duration was not jittered. The total silent period between stimulus presentations was 2620 ms, and consisted of a 300 ms silent period, 2000 ms for a volume acquisition, another 300 ms of silence, and a 20 ms silent interval that helped the stimulus computer maintain precise and accurate timing during stimulus presentation. \n\n\n### Functional MRI preprocessing \n  \nfMRI data collected in each of the 10 functional runs were subject to the following preprocessing procedures. The first five volumes were not analyzed to allow for signal equilibration. A linear shim correction was applied separately for each slice during reconstruction by using a magnetic field map acquired automatically by the pulse sequence at the beginning of the scan. Translational movement in millimeters (x, y, z) was calculated based on the SPM8 parameters for motion correction of the functional images in each subject. To correct for deviant volumes resulting from spikes in movement, we used a de-spiking procedure. Volumes with movement exceeding 0.5\u00a0voxels (1.562 mm) or spikes in global signal exceeding 5% were interpolated using adjacent scans. The majority of volumes repaired occurred in isolation. After the interpolation procedure, images were spatially normalized to standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, resampled to 2 mm isotropic voxels, and smoothed with a 6 mm full-width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. \n\n\n### Movement criteria for inclusion in fMRI analysis \n  \nFor inclusion in the fMRI analysis, we required that each functional run had a maximum scan-to-scan movement of\u00a0<\u00a06 mm and no more than 15% of volumes were corrected in the de-spiking procedure. Moreover, we required that all individual subject data included in the analysis consisted of at least seven functional runs that met our criteria for scan-to-scan movement and percentage of volumes corrected; subjects who had fewer than seven functional runs that met our movement criteria were not included in the data analysis. All 42 participants included in the analysis had at least seven functional runs that met our movement criteria, and the total number of runs included for TD and ASD groups were similar (TD\u00a0=\u00a0192 runs; ASD\u00a0=\u00a0188 runs). \n\n\n### Voxel-wise analysis of fMRI activation \n  \nThe goal of this analysis was to identify brain regions that showed differential activity levels in response to mother\u2019s voice, unfamiliar voices, and environmental sounds. Brain activation related to each vocal\u00a0task condition was first modeled at the individual subject level using boxcar functions with a canonical hemodynamic response function and a temporal derivative to account for voxel-wise latency differences in hemodynamic response. Environmental sounds were not modeled to avoid collinearity, and this stimulus served as the baseline condition. Low-frequency drifts at each voxel were removed using a high-pass filter (0.5 cycles/min) and serial correlations were accounted for by modeling the fMRI time series as a first-degree autoregressive process ( ). We performed whole-brain ANOVAs to separately investigate unfamiliar and mother\u2019s voice processing: (1) the unfamiliar voice analysis used the factors group (TD and ASD) and auditory condition (unfamiliar voices and environmental sounds) and (2) the mother\u2019s voice analysis used the factors group (TD and ASD) and voice condition (mother's\u00a0voice and unfamiliar voices). These ANOVAs were designed to test specific hypotheses described in the Introduction. Group-level activation was determined using individual subject contrast images and a second-level analysis of variance. The main contrasts of interest were [mother\u2019s voice \u2013 unfamiliar female voices] and [unfamiliar female voices \u2013 environmental\u00a0sounds]. Significant clusters of activation were determined using a voxel-wise statistical height threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.005, with family-wise error corrections for multiple spatial comparisons (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05; 67 voxels) determined using Monte Carlo simulations ( ;  ) using a custom Matlab script (see Source Code). To examine GLM results in the inferior colliculus and NAc, small subcortical brain structures, we used a small volume correction at p<0.05 with a voxel-wise statistical height threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.005. To determine the robustness of our findings, group comparisons were also performed using more stringent height and extent thresholds ( \u2013 ). To provide estimates of effect sizes within specific regions displayed in  ,   t  -scores from the whole-brain TD vs. ASD group GLM analysis were averaged within each significant cluster. Effect sizes were then computed as Cohen\u2019s   d   according to   below, where   t   is the mean   t  -score within a cluster and   N   is the sample size: \n\nTo define specific cortical regions, we used the Harvard\u2013Oxford probabilistic structural atlas ( ) with a probability threshold of 25%. \n\n\n### Brain-behavior analysis \n  \nRegression analysis was used to examine the relationship between brain responses to unfamiliar and mother\u2019s voice and social\u00a0communication abilities in children with ASD. Social\u00a0communication function was assessed using the Social Affect subscore of the ADOS-2 (47). Brain-behavior relationships were examined using analysis of activation levels. A whole-brain, voxel-wise regression analysis was performed in which the relation between fMRI activity and social\u00a0communication scores was examined using images contrasting [unfamiliar female voices\u00a0>\u00a0environmental sounds] and [mother\u2019s vs. unfamiliar female voices]. Significant clusters were determined using a voxel-wise statistical height threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.005, with family-wise error corrections for multiple spatial comparisons (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05; 67 voxels) determined using Monte Carlo simulations ( ;  ). To determine the robustness of our findings, brain-behavior relations were also examined using more stringent height and extent thresholds ( \u2013 ). To provide estimates of effect sizes within regions displayed in  ,   t  -scores from the whole-brain ASD Social Communication covariate analysis were averaged within each cluster identified in the GLM analysis. Effect sizes were then computed as Cohen\u2019s   f   according to   below, where   t   is the mean   t  -score within a cluster and   N   is the sample size: \n\n\n### Brain activity levels and prediction of social function \n  \nTo examine the robustness and reliability of brain activity levels for predicting social\u00a0communication scores, we used support vector regression (SVR) to perform a confirmatory cross-validation analysis that employs a machine-learning approach with balanced fourfold cross-validation (CV) combined with linear regression ( ). In this analysis, we extracted individual subject activation beta values taken from the [unfamiliar female voices\u00a0>\u00a0environmental sounds] and [mother\u2019s voice\u00a0>\u00a0unfamiliar female voices] GLM contrasts. For the [unfamiliar female voices\u00a0>\u00a0environmental sounds] GLM contrast, GLM betas were extracted from right-hemisphere PP and AI as well as left-hemisphere NAc. For the [mother\u2019s voice\u00a0>\u00a0unfamiliar female voices] GLM contrast, GLM betas were extracted from left-hemisphere HG, PP, and AI as well as right-hemisphere mSTS, vmPFC, rACC, and SMA. These values were entered as independent variables in a linear regression analysis with ADOS-2 Social Affect subscores as the dependent variable. r  , a measure of how well the independent variable predicts the dependent variable, was first estimated using a balanced fourfold CV procedure. Data were divided into four folds so that the distributions of dependent and independent variables were balanced across folds. Data were randomly assigned to four folds and the independent and dependent variables tested in one-way ANOVAs, repeating as necessary until both ANOVAs were insignificant in order to guarantee balance across the folds. A linear regression model was built using three folds leaving out the fourth, and this model was then used to predict the data in the left-out fold. This procedure was repeated four times to compute a final r  representing the correlation between the data predicted by the regression model and the observed data. Finally, the statistical significance of the model was assessed using a nonparametric testing approach. The empirical null distribution of r   was estimated by generating 1000 surrogate datasets under the null hypothesis that there was no association between changes in ADOS social\u00a0communication subscore and brain activity levels. \n\n\n### Functional connectivity analysis \n  \nWe examined functional connectivity between ROIs using the generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) model ( ), with the goal of identifying connectivity between ROIs in response to each task condition as well differences between task conditions (mother\u2019s voice, other voice, environmental sounds). We used the SPM gPPI toolbox for this analysis. gPPI is more sensitive than standard PPI to task context-dependent differences in connectivity ( ). Unlike dynamical causal modeling (DCM), gPPI does not use a temporal precedence model (x(t\u00a0+\u00a01)~x(t)) and therefore makes no claims of causality. The gPPI model is summarized in   below: \n\nBriefly, in each participant, the regional timeseries from a seed ROI was deconvolved to uncover quasi-neuronal activity and then multiplied with the task design waveform for each task condition to form condition-specific gPPI interaction terms. These interaction terms are then convolved with the hemodynamic response function (HRF) to form gPPI regressors for each task condition. The final step is a standard general linear model predicting target ROI response after regressing out any direct effects of the activity in the seed ROI. In the equation above,  \u00a0and  \u00a0are the time series in the two brain regions, and  \u00a0contains three columns corresponding to each task condition.\u00a0The goal of this analysis was to examine connectivity patterns within an extended voice-selective network identified in a previous study of children with ASD ( ). This study showed weak intrinsic connectivity between bilateral voice-selective STS and regions implicated in reward, salience, memory, and affective processing. The rationale for the use of an   a priori   network is it is an established method of network identification that preempts task and sample-related biases in region-of-interest (ROI) selection. This approach therefore allows for a more generalizable set of results compared to a network defined based on nodes identified using the current sample of children and task conditions. The network used in all connectivity analyses consisted of 16 regions. All cortical ROIs were constructed as 5 mm spheres centered on the coordinates listed in  , while subcortical ROIs were constructed as 2 mm spheres. \n\n\n### Functional connectivity, group classification, and prediction of social function \n  \nSupport vector classification (SVC) and regression (SVR) were used to examine whether patterns of connectivity within the extended voice processing network could predict TD vs. ASD group membership and social\u00a0communication abilities in children with ASD, respectively. First, to examine TD vs. ASD group membership, a linear support vector machine algorithm (C\u00a0=\u00a01) from the open-source library LIBSVM ( ) was used to build classifiers to distinguish children with ASD from TD children during unfamiliar voice processing. Individual subject connectivity matrices (16 \u00d7 16 ROIs) taken from the [unfamiliar female voices\u00a0>\u00a0environmental sounds] gPPI contrast were used as features to train classifiers in each dataset. Classifier performance was evaluated using a four-fold cross-validation procedure. Specifically, a dataset was randomly partitioned into four folds. Three folds of data (training set) were used to train a classifier, which was then applied to the remaining fold (test set) to predict whether each sample in the test set should be classified as ASD or TD. This procedure was repeated four times with each of the four folds used exactly once as a test set. The average classification accuracy across the four folds (cross-validation accuracy) was used to evaluate the classifier\u2019s performance. To further account for variation due to random data partition, we repeated the same cross-validation procedure 100 times with different random data partitions. Finally, the mean cross-validation accuracies from 100 iterations was reported, and its statistical significance was evaluated using permutation testing (1000 times) by randomly permuting subjects\u2019 labels and repeating the same above procedures. The same SVC methods were used to examine whether connectivity features during mothers voice processing could accurately predict TD vs. ASD group membership, however in this analysis individual subject connectivity matrices (16 \u00d7 16 ROIs) taken from the [mother\u2019s voice\u00a0>\u00a0unfamiliar female voices] gPPI contrast were used as features to train\u00a0the classifier. \n\nFinally, SVR was used to examine whether connectivity patterns during unfamiliar female and mother\u2019s voice processing could predict social\u00a0communication scores in children with ASD. SVR methods are the same as those described in   Brain Activity Levels and Prediction of Social Function  ; however, features in this analysis include multivariate connectivity patterns across the extended voice-selective network (16 ROIs). Given that brain activation results showed that both unfamiliar ( ) and mother\u2019s voice processing ( ) explained variance in social\u00a0communication abilities, we used a combination of connectivity features from both vocal conditions for this analysis. Specifically, connectivity features from both the [unfamiliar female voices\u00a0>\u00a0environmental sounds] and [mother\u2019s voice\u00a0>\u00a0unfamiliar female voices] gPPI contrasts were entered as independent variables in a linear regression analysis with ADOS-2 Social Affect subscores as the dependent variable. \n\nAs a confirmatory analysis, and to examine the robustness of SVC and SVR results, we used GLMnet ( ), a logistic regression classifier that includes regularization and exploits sparsity in the input matrix, on the same 16 \u00d7 16 connectivity matrices described for the SVC and SVR analyses above. \n\n\n### Stimulus design considerations \n  \nPrevious studies investigating the processing ( ;  ) and neural bases ( ;  ) of mother\u2019s voice processing have used a design in which one mother\u2019s voice serves as a control voice for another participant. However, due to an important practical limitation, the current study used a design in which all participants heard the same two control voices. While we make every effort to recruit children from a variety of communities in the San Francisco Bay Area, some level of recruitment occurs through contact with specific schools, and in other instances our participants refer their friends to our lab for inclusion in our studies. In these cases, it is a reasonable possibility that our participants may have known other mothers involved in the study, and therefore may be familiar with these mothers\u2019 voices, which would limit the control we were seeking in our control voices. Importantly, HIPPA guidelines are explicit that participant information is confidential, and therefore there would be no way to probe whether a child knows any of the other families involved in the study. Given this practical consideration, we concluded that it would be best to use the same two control voices, which we knew were unfamiliar to the participants, for all participants\u2019 data collection. \n\n\n### Stimulus recording \n  \nRecordings of each mother were made individually while their child was undergoing neuropsychological testing. Mother\u2019s voice stimuli and control voices were recorded in a quiet conference room using a Shure PG27-USB condenser microphone connected to a MacBook Air laptop. The audio signal was digitized at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz and A/D converted with 16-bit resolution. Mothers were positioned in the conference room to avoid early sound wave reflections from contaminating the recordings. To provide a natural speech context for the recording of each nonsense word, mothers were instructed to repeat three sentences, each of which contained one of the nonsense words, during the recording. The first word of each of these sentence was their child\u2019s name, which was followed by the words \u2018that is a,\u2019 followed by one of the three nonsense words. A hypothetical example of a sentence spoken by a mother for the recording was \u2018Johnny, that is a keebudieshawlt.\u2019 Prior to beginning the recording, mothers were instructed on how to produce these nonsense words by repeating them to the experimenter until the mothers had reached proficiency. Importantly, mothers were instructed to say these sentences using the tone of voice they would use when speaking with their child during an engaging and enjoyable shared learning experience (e.g. if their child asked them to identify an item at a museum). The vocal recording session resulted in digitized recordings of the mothers repeating each of the three sentences approximately 30 times to ensure multiple high-quality samples of each nonsense word for each mother. \n\n\n### Stimulus post-processing \n  \nThe goal of stimulus post-processing was to isolate the three nonsense words from the sentences that each mother spoke during the recording session and normalize them for duration and RMS amplitude for inclusion in the fMRI stimulus presentation protocol and the mother\u2019s voice identification task. First, a digital sound editor (Audacity:  ) was used to isolate each utterance of the three nonsense words from the sentences spoken by each mother. The three best versions of each nonsense word were then selected based on the audio and vocal quality of the utterances (i.e. eliminating versions that were mispronounced, included vocal creak, or were otherwise not ideal exemplars of the nonsense words). These nine nonsense words were then normalized for duration to 956 ms, the mean duration of the nonsense words produced by the unfamiliar female voices, using Praat software similar to previous studies ( ;  ). A 10 msec linear fade (ramp and damp) was then performed on each stimulus to prevent click-like sounds at the beginning and end of the stimuli, and then stimuli were equated for RMS amplitude. These final stimuli were then evaluated for audibility and clarity to ensure that post-processing manipulations had\u00a0not introduced any artifacts into the samples. The same process was performed on the control voices and environmental sounds to ensure that all stimuli presented in the fMRI experiment were the same duration and RMS amplitude. \n\n\n### Post-scan mother\u2019s voice identification task \n  \nAll participants who participated in the fMRI experiment completed an auditory behavioral test following the fMRI scan. The goal of the Mother\u2019s Voice Identification Task was to determine if the participants could reliably discriminate their mother\u2019s voice from unfamiliar female voices. Participants were seated in a quiet room in front of a laptop computer, and headphones were placed over their ears. In each trial, participants were presented with a recording of a multisyllabic nonsense word spoken by either the participant\u2019s mother or a control mother, and the task was to indicate whether or not their mother spoke the word. The multisyllabic nonsense words used in the behavioral task were the exact same samples used in the fMRI task. Each participant was presented with 54 randomly ordered nonsense words: 18 produced by the subject\u2019s mother and the remaining 36 produced by unfamiliar female voices. \n\n\n### Signal level analysis \n  \nGroup mean activation differences for key brain regions identified in the whole-brain univariate analysis were calculated to examine the basis for TD\u00a0>\u00a0ASD group differences for both [unfamiliar female voices\u00a0>\u00a0environmental sounds] ( ) and [mother\u2019s voice\u00a0>\u00a0unfamiliar female voices] contrasts ( ). The reason for this analysis is that stimulus differences can result from a number of different factors. For example, both mother\u2019s voice and unfamiliar female voices could elicit reduced activity relative to baseline and significant stimulus differences could be driven by greater negative activation in response to unfamiliar female voices. Significant stimulus differences were inherent to this ROI analysis as they are based on results from the whole-brain GLM analysis ( ); however, results provide important information regarding the magnitude and sign of results in response to both stimulus conditions. Baseline for this analysis was calculated as the brain response to environmental sounds. The coordinates for the ROIs used in the signal level analysis were based on peaks in TD\u00a0>\u00a0ASD group maps for the [unfamiliar female voices\u00a0>\u00a0environmental sounds] and [mother\u2019s voice\u00a0>\u00a0unfamiliar female voices] contrasts. Cortical ROIs were defined as 5 mm spheres, and subcortical ROIs were 2 mm spheres, centered at the peaks in the TD\u00a0>\u00a0ASD group maps for the [unfamiliar female voices\u00a0>\u00a0environmental sounds] or [mother\u2019s voice\u00a0>unfamiliar female voices] contrasts. Signal level was calculated by extracting the \u03b2-value from individual subjects\u2019 contrast maps for the [unfamiliar female voices\u00a0>\u00a0environmental sounds] and [mother\u2019s voice\u00a0>environmental sounds] comparisons. The mean \u03b2-value within each ROI was computed for both contrasts in all subjects. The group mean \u03b2 and its standard error for each ROI are plotted in  . \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6391069, "text_md5": "5561b9c611a81cd0af64cebc41bcc5b9", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 165], "journal": [166, 171], "publication_year": [173, 177], "title": [188, 299], "keywords": [313, 361], "abstract": [374, 1701], "body": [1710, 61412]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 30806350, "doi": "10.7554/eLife.39906", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6391069", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6391069"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6391069\">6391069</a>", "list_title": "PMC6391069  Impaired voice processing in reward and salience circuits predicts social communication in children with autism"}

Neurodevelopmental changes orient adolescents toward salient social cues in their environment. We examined whether neural regions that track popularity are associated with longitudinal changes in risk-taking and prosocial behavior. During an fMRI scan, adolescents (n\u00a0=\u00a0109, M =13.59, SD=0.59) viewed pictures of their popular and unpopular classmates based on sociometric nominations from their social networks. Neural tracking of high popularity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was associated with increases in risk-taking behavior, whereas tracking of low popularity in the right insula was associated with increases in prosocial behavior. Results suggest that individual differences in neural tracking of popularity relate to longitudinal changes in adolescents\u2019 social behaviors. \n \n\n# Body\n \nAdolescence is a sensitive period for social development wherein peer hierarchies become particularly salient, and enhancing peer status is highly valued ( ). Such sensitivity to peer status may arise from neural changes in the developing brain that orient adolescents to social cues in their environment. Heightened sensitivity to peer status plays a large role in shaping goals and behavior ( ), such that adolescents are more likely to prioritize peer status gains over other social and academic goals ( ). Indeed, adolescents with high peer status (i.e., rated as most popular by their peers) tend to engage in a variety of risky behaviors ( ,  ,  ), and it has been theorized that those who desire to increase their status may engage in greater risk-taking to more closely align themselves with their popular peers ( ,  ). On the other hand, adolescents who tend to be more sensitive to peers with low peer status (i.e., rated as least popular; are rejected by their peers) may show increased prosocial behavior that is subserved by an empathic response ( ,  ). In the present study, we examined whether adolescents\u2019 neural sensitivity to their high and low status peers from their real-life social networks predicted longitudinal changes in risk-taking and prosocial behavior. \n\n## Neurobiological Sensitivity to Social Hierarchies \n  \nNavigating social hierarchies and detecting valued members is a critical aspect of thriving in social groups. From an evolutionary perspective, these processes are essential for advanced social species and likely played a key role in the evolution of complex neural circuitry in primates and humans ( ,  ). There are numerous studies that probe the cognitive and perceptual processes involved with status detection in adult humans and non-human primates (for a review, see  ). Yet researchers have only recently investigated the neural mechanisms by which individuals track peer status in real-world networks. These studies have identified that regions associated with social cognition (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and precuneus) and valuation (ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), ventral striatum (VS), and amygdala) spontaneously encode peer status information from real-world peer groups in young adults ( ,  ,  ). However, little is known about these mechanisms and behavioral consequences in adolescence when social hierarchies become especially salient. \n\nAdolescents show an increased orientation towards social cues and peer contexts ( ,  ,  ,  ). For instance, adolescents focus more on social hierarchies within their peer networks compared to children and adults ( ). Moreover, when viewing images of peers and social rewards, adolescents show greater activation than adults in brain regions associated with valuation (e.g., vmPFC, VS, and amygdala;  ;  ) and social cognition (e.g., dmPFC and TPJ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Although no research to date has examined how these neural regions associated with valuation and social cognition track peer status in adolescents, it is plausible that they would track status cues within the peer group because high status peers are highly valued and because adolescents wish to understand the thoughts and intentions of these peers. \n\nWhile many socio-cognitive and perceptual processes preferentially encode information pertaining to high status individuals ( ), few studies have probed whether any neural systems are particularly involved with attending to information about individuals with low status. However, numerous studies have investigated the neural correlates of witnessing rejection in an experimental setting. These paradigms have consistently elicited activations in regions associated with affective empathy (insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)), which involves sharing the emotional experiences or pain of others, and cognitive empathy (mPFC and precuneus), which involves taking the perspective of others ( ,  ,  ). However, these findings are limited to specific incidents of exclusion in an experiment and may not extend to the passive viewing of chronically rejected peers. For example, in a task in which young adults passively viewed peers within their social network, mPFC activation discriminated high status peers from others, but did not differentiate between medium and low status peers ( ). \n\n\n## The role of peer status in adolescents\u2019 risky and prosocial behavior \n  \nAdolescents are more sensitive to feedback related to peer acceptance and rejection ( ) and feel greater distress following social exclusion compared to children and adults ( ). Thus, it is not surprising that adolescents are more likely to adjust their behaviors to conform with high status individuals within their social networks ( ,  ). Adolescents with higher status are more likely to engage in tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol use, as well as risky sexual behavior ( ,  ,  ,  ), and their peers can recognize this association ( ,  ). Since adolescents recognize that risky behaviors are associated with higher status, those who value status and are highly sensitive to it may be more likely to engage in risky behaviors as a status-seeking behavior ( ,  ). Indeed, engagement in risky behaviors has been associated with greater orientation towards high-status peers ( ,  ) and status-seeking behaviors in digital contexts ( ). \n\nWhile low status peers are less likely to be prosocial themselves, they are more likely to be the beneficiaries of prosocial behavior ( ), indicating that others\u2019 orientation towards rejected peers may subserve increased prosociality. This is supported by neuroimaging findings that witnessing rejection is associated with heightened activation in brain regions involved in cognitive and affective empathy (e.g., insula dACC, mPFC and precuneus), which in turn predicts increased prosociality towards the victim ( ,  ,  ). Thus, variance in neural sensitivity to unpopular peers may reflect individual differences in empathic responses, which may ultimately drive differences in prosocial behavior. \n\n\n## The current study \n  \nIn the current study, we examined how individual differences in neural sensitivity to peers with high and low status predicts longitudinal changes in risk-taking and prosocial behavior in early adolescence. It is important to note that, while research has differentiated between two forms of status in adolescence \u2013 popularity (whether one is viewed by their peers as being popular, regardless of whether they are well liked) and social preference (whether one is well-liked by their peers) \u2013 the current study solely focuses on popularity, since enhancing popularity is particularly valued by adolescents and has the greatest potential to influence behavior ( ). Social preference data (i.e., liking) was collected, and the associated analyses can be found in the supplement. \n\nParticipants completed a novel fMRI task, the \u201cClassmates Task\u201d, wherein they viewed yearbook photos of their classmates from their school and grade. We used peer-nominated sociometric ratings from 873 students across 3 middle-schools to sort these photos by popularity, such that participants saw sequences of highly popular and unpopular peers from their school grade. Studying sensitivity to popularity is particularly appropriate for this age range given that prioritization of status peaks in early adolescence ( ). By utilizing sociometric data and ecologically valid stimuli of real-world peers, this study allows us to further our understanding of how adolescents perceive popularity in their social networks. Moreover, by leveraging longitudinal data, this study helps elucidate how sensitivity to social hierarchies contributes to positive and negative behavioral trajectories. \n\nWe assessed whether brain regions that track the status of peers from their real-life social network predict changes in adolescents\u2019 risk-taking and prosocial behavior over the course of a year. Based on research in adults ( ,  ,  ), we expected to find neural tracking of high popularity in regions associated with social cognition (dmPFC, TPJ and precuneus) and valuation (vmPFC, ventral striatum, and amygdala), and that heightened neural tracking to popularity in these regions would predict longitudinal increases in risk-taking behavior over the course of a year. Given the lack of findings regarding neural sensitivity to low popularity, these analyses are exploratory. However, previous work on neural sensitivity to witnessing rejection suggests that neural tracking of low popularity may occur in regions associated with affective (insula and dACC) and cognitive (mPFC) empathy, and that individual differences in such activation may predict subsequent prosocial behavior ( ,  ,  ). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study consists of data collection across 3 waves when participants were in the 6th and 7th grade (wave 1, 2016\u20132017 school year), 7th and 8th grade (wave 2, 2017\u20132018 school year), and 8th and 9th grade (wave 3, 2018\u20132019 school year). For the purposes of this study, sociometric nominations were obtained during school-based testing at wave 1 and 2, fMRI data were collected at wave 2, and self-report measures were obtained in waves 2 and 3. \n\nParticipants were recruited from three rural public middle schools in the southeast United States (N\u00a0=\u00a01385) as part of a five-year longitudinal study. Letters of consent were mailed to all caregivers of students, with an option to grant or deny consent for their child to participate in the study. Approximately 77 % of families (n\u00a0=\u00a01059 families) returned signed forms; 88 % (n\u00a0=\u00a0935) of these gave consent for their child to participate, yielding a sample that represented 67.5 % of the population in this community. A total of 873 consented students participated in school-based assessments at wave 1 (see supplement for demographics of the full school sample). School-based assessments were collected in the schools annually. Assent and data were obtained using computer-assisted self-interviews administered by trained research staff in school. At each wave, peer nominations and self-report measures were collected, including the prosocial tendencies measure. Participants were compensated with a monetary remuneration of $5 at each wave. \n\nParticipants from the larger study who provided interest in being contacted for a future study were called and screened for eligibility (i.e., MRI contraindications) and recruited for the fMRI study within the same academic year as the larger study. Participants completed annual fMRI scans, each one year apart. For the first wave of data collection, 284 families were screened, of whom 91 were ineligible due to learning disabilities, braces, head trauma, or other MRI contraindications, and 45 were eligible but did not participate due to scheduling difficulties or no longer interested in participating, resulting in a final sample of 148 adolescents. To account for attrition, an additional 30 participants were recruited at wave 2 to the neuroimaging subsample. Adolescents and parents gave written assent/consent in accordance with the university\u2019s Institutional Review Board. At wave 2, participants completed an fMRI scan that lasted approximately 1.5\u00a0h, during which they completed the Classmates task, as well as four other tasks that are not the focus of this manuscript. Following the scan, adolescents completed several self-report measures using computer-assisted software in a private room, including risk-taking behaviors, as well as other measures which are not the focus of this manuscript. Adolescents were compensated with a monetary remuneration of $90, a $20 gift card for performing well in the scanner (e.g., minimum motion), an extra $25 as a bonus for returning to our study for wave 2, snacks during the visit, and a meal. Parents were compensated with a monetary remuneration of $50, as well as a meal, compensation for gas, and parking. \n\nOf the 141 participants who completed an fMRI scan at wave 2, 135 participants completed the Classmates fMRI task. Of these, 3 were excluded from analyses for excessive head motion (> 2\u00a0mm in any direction), 15 were excluded due to an error in calculating the sociometric ratings of target images in the Classmates task (see the \u201cfMRI task\u201d subsection for more details) and 8 were excluded for missing sociometric data, resulting in a final sample of 109 adolescents (57 female) ages 12\u201315 (M  =\u00a013.59, SD =\u00a00.59). Of these 109 participants, 103 had the risk-taking measure and 100 had the prosocial tendencies measure across waves 2 and 3. Participants were from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds (39 Hispanic/Latino, 33 White, 23 Black/African American, 12 multiracial, 2 Native American). Overall, the sample was from low to middle socioeconomic status in terms of parental reported household income (32 % <$30,000, 40% $30\u2013$60,000, 25% over $60,000, 3 % did not respond), and parental education of the primary caregiver (24% less than high school, 11 % high school diploma, 38 % some college, 27 % associate degree or higher). \n\n\n### Measures \n  \nData used in the current study include sociometric ratings of peer status collected at wave 1 and 2, the Classmates fMRI task collected at wave 2, and self-report measures of risk-taking and prosocial behaviors collected at wave 2 and 3. \n\n#### Sociometric ratings of peer status \n  \nSociometric procedures were used to measure peer status as part of the larger study. During the school based assessment, participants were given a full list of their peers within their school and grade level and were asked to identify (1) who they like the most, (2) who they like the least, 3) who is the most popular, and (4) who is the least popular. There was no limit to the number of peers they could nominate. Based on the peer nominations from the school based assessment, we calculated   social preference   (z-score of \u201cliked the most\u201d minus z-score of \u201cliked the least\u201d) and   popularity   (z-score of \u201cmost popular\u201d minus z-score of \u201cleast popular\u201d) scores for each participant in the school. This z-score for each sociometric index is based on their relative rating compared to other students within their school and grade. These peer nominations collected during wave 1 were used to create the stimuli in the fMRI task, which was administered at wave 2. Peer nominations were also collected during wave 2, which were used to control for participants\u2019 own popularity in analyses. \n\n\n#### Prosocial Tendencies \n  \nDuring the school based assessment, participants completed the Prosocial Tendencies Measure ( ). Adolescents reported on how much they feel 19 different behavioral tendencies apply to them on a 5-point scale (1\u00a0= Does not describe me at all, 2\u00a0= Describes me a little, 3\u00a0= Somewhat describes me, 4\u00a0= Describes me well, 5\u00a0= Describes me greatly). The scale includes 5 subscales that assess different motivations for prosocial behavior. In the current study, we focused on the 4 subscales that are most closely associated with positive, other-oriented motivations for prosocial behavior, including anonymous (4 questions; e.g., \u201cMost of the time, I help others who do not know who helped them\u201d), emotional (5 questions; e.g., \u201cI tend to help others when they are very emotional\u201d), dire (3 questions; e.g., \u201cI tend to help people who are in a real crisis or need\u201d), and altruism (4 questions, reverse-scored; e.g., \u201cI feel that if I help someone, they should help me in the future\u201d). We took the average of all items across these subscales to create one index of prosocial behavior (Cronbach's \u03b1  =\u00a00.84, \u03b1  =\u00a00.87). \n\n\n#### Risk-Taking Behaviors \n  \nParticipants completed a modified version of the Adolescent Risk-taking Scale ( ). Adolescents reported on their frequency of engaging in 14 risky behaviors on a 4-point scale (0\u00a0= never, 1\u00a0= once or twice, 2 = several times, 3 = many times). The scale included questions about rule breaking (e.g., \u201cI have snuck out of my house without my parents knowing\u201d), sexual activity (e.g., \u201cI have had sex with someone I just met\u201d), substance use (e.g., \u201cI have gotten drunk or high at a party\u201d), and dangerous behavior (e.g., \u201cI did something risky or dangerous on a dare\u201d). A total mean score for all items was calculated (Cronbach's \u03b1  =\u00a00.72, \u03b1  =\u00a00.75). \n\n\n\n### fMRI Task \n  \nDuring the Classmates task, which was adapted from  , participants viewed yearbook photos of their peers from school. The yearbook photos (i.e., targets) used in the task were selected based on the sociometric data from the previous year (wave 1), because of the time required to process the sociometric data and create the scan task. However, we ran correlations between wave 1 and wave 2 for all four sociometric categories to establish that peer status was highly stable across years (i.e. High Popularity: r\u00a0=\u00a00.67, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001; Low Popularity: r\u00a0=\u00a00.76, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001; High Social Preference: r\u00a0=\u00a00.80, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001; Low Social Preference: r\u00a0=\u00a00.81, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) in line with prior research ( ). To be selected as a target for the task, the peer needed to have a sociometric z-score between 1 and 5 (representing 1\u20135\u00a0SD above the mean on popularity/social preference in their school and grade) or between \u2212\u00a01 and \u2212\u00a05 (representing 1\u20135\u00a0SD below the mean on popularity/social preference in their school and grade). One version of the task was created for each grade level within each school (three middle schools, each with 2 grades, resulting in six versions total). The task had four conditions: High social preference (i.e., z-score between 1 and 5 on social preference), low social preference (i.e., z-score between \u22121 and \u22125 on social preference), high popularity (e.g., z-score between 1 and 5 on popularity), and low popularity (i.e., z-score between \u22121 and \u22125 on popularity). Within each condition, there were 10 targets, and we aimed for an equal number of boys and girls within each condition. Due to a data management error, z-scores for the targets from one of the schools (two of the six task versions) were incorrect and did not necessarily fall within the criteria (i.e., z-score between \u00b1\u00a01 and 5). Popularity and social preference scores were recalculated for the target images in these task versions. For one group of participants (n\u00a0=\u00a020), there were a sufficient number of target images that still fit the criteria for each condition (High Popularity =\u00a09, Low Popularity =\u00a08, High Social Preference = 8, Low Social Preference =\u00a010), so these participants were included. For the other group, there were an insufficient number of target images fitting the criteria (e.g., as few as 5) in the conditions, so these participants (n\u00a0=\u00a015) were excluded. Across all versions of the task that were retained, the average z-score within each condition was approximately 2 (see supplement for details). There was no overlap in the targets across conditions, such that each target belonged in only one sociometric category and appeared in only one condition. No participants were included as targets so that no participant would see their own image. Target photos were obtained from school yearbooks from the previous school year, the same year the sociometric ratings were collected. Yearbook photos were digitized into JPEG images. \n\nThe task was programmed in E-Prime and presented across two runs. Each run consisted of eight blocks, two blocks per condition, each with 10 faces. Within each run, participants were presented with the eight blocks in a randomized order. The order in which their faces were shown was fixed within the block with the order pre-selected based on a randomization algorithm. We used an n-back task design ( ) to ensure that the participants were paying attention, such that each block contained one target that appeared twice in a row. Participants were instructed to press with their right pointer finger when a target repeated. Due to the limited number of peers who satisfied our criteria for high and low status (greater or less than one standard deviation from the average) and in order to achieve the power for neuroimaging analysis on visual stimuli, we repeated each peer face across the conditions, in line with previous studies (e.g.,  ;  ). Having participants passively view faces was also in line with these previous studies in young adults, allowing us to probe the spontaneous neural processes adolescents use to encode social status information. The repeated targets were fixed in the task and balanced so that no target was shown more than another (i.e., when a target was shown twice in one block, that target was absent from the next block). Thus, participants saw each face 4 times total (2 in each run), with each condition having 40 total trials each. Each target face was presented for 1750\u00a0ms, separated by a jittered inter-trial interval (  M  =2300\u00a0ms, range: 565.8 \u2013 4936.8\u00a0ms). Each block was approximately 40.5\u00a0s, and the total time of each run was 336\u00a0s \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nImaging data were collected using a 3 Tesla Siemens Prisma MRI scanner. The Classmates Task was presented on a computer screen and projected through a mirror. A high-resolution structural T2\u00a0*\u00a0-weighted echo-planar imaging (EPI) volume (TR = 2000\u00a0ms; TE = 25\u00a0ms; matrix = 92\u00a0\u00d792; FOV = 230\u00a0mm; 37 slices; slice thickness = 3\u00a0mm; voxel size 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm3) was acquired coplanar with a T2\u00a0*\u00a0-weighted structural matched-bandwidth (MBW), high-resolution, anatomical scan (TR = 5700\u00a0ms; TE = 65\u00a0ms; matrix = 192\u00a0\u00d7192; FOV = 230\u00a0mm; 38 slices; slice thickness = 3\u00a0mm). In addition, a T1\u00a0*\u00a0magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE; TR = 2400\u00a0ms; TE = 2.22\u00a0ms; matrix = 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256; FOV = 256\u00a0mm; sagittal plane; slice thickness = 0.8\u00a0mm; 208 slices) was acquired. The orientation for the EPI and MBW scans was oblique axial to maximize brain coverage and to reduce noise. Preprocessing was conducted using FSL (FMRIB\u2019s Software Library, version 6.0; www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) and included the following steps: Skull stripping using BET ( ); motion correction with MCFLIRT ( ); spatial smoothing with Gaussian kernel of full width at half maximum (FWHM) 6\u00a0mm; high-pass temporal filtering with a filter width of 128\u00a0s (Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting, with sigma=64.0\u00a0s); grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire 4D dataset by a single multiplicative factor; and individual level ICA denoising for motion and physiological noise using MELODIC (version 3.15;  ), combined with an automated signal classifier ( ; Neyman-Pearson threshold =0.3). For the spatial normalization, the EPI data were registered to the T1 image with a linear transformation, followed by a white-matter boundary based transformation (BBR;  ) using FLIRT, linear and non-linear transformations to standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 2-mm brain were performed using Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs;  ), and then spatial normalization of the EPI image to the MNI. Quality check during preprocessing and analyses ensured adequate signal coverage. \n\n\n### fMRI Data analysis \n  \nIndividual level, fixed-effects analyses were estimated using the general linear model convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function in SPM12. We modeled the task as an event-related design with four separate conditions wherein sociometric ratings were used as parametric modulators: high popularity, low popularity, high social preference, and low social preference. Inter-trial jitters were not explicitly modeled and thus served as an implicit baseline. The absolute value of the sociometric rating for the target (i.e., social preference score for the low and high social preference conditions; popularity score for the low and high popular conditions) was included as a parametric modulator (PM) at the trial level. Importantly, the sociometric ratings ranged from relatively lower to high scores within each of the four conditions, which allowed us to examine whether adolescents linearly track peer status at the neural level within each condition (e.g., linear tracking of peers with sociometric popularity between 1 and 5\u00a0SD above average for the high popularity condition, see supplement for details). Within each block, one target was repeated as an attention check. The repeated target was treated as a separate condition and was modeled as a contrast of no interest. TRs with motion greater than.5 framewise displacement were modeled as a nuisance regressor. Since our primary aim was to examine adolescents\u2019 sensitivity to popularity, we focus our analyses on this condition. Moreover, we decided to analyze popularity without controlling for social preference ratings. While popularity and social preference are different constructs, they share contributing factors (e.g. attractiveness, social competency, extraversion, etc.) ( ), and are often correlated with one another (in our sample, r\u00a0=\u00a00.45, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Since these constructs are correlated with one another, controlling for social preference among target images may remove important variance. Analyses solely focusing on social preference can be found in the supplement. \n\nThe individual-level contrast images were submitted to random effects group-level analyses using GlmFlex. We examined if neural sensitivity to high and low popularity (using popularity scores as parametric modulators in each condition) differentially predicted longitudinal changes in risk-taking and prosocial behavior. To this end, we ran whole brain regressions in which we regressed neural tracking of popularity at wave 2 onto risk-taking at wave 3 controlling for risk-taking at wave 2. We ran the same model with prosocial behaviors. In addition, we controlled for participants\u2019 own sociometric popularity from wave 2. Results from these whole brain analyses reveal whether brain regions which show increasing sensitivity to popularity, measured via the parametric modulators, predict longitudinal changes in risk-taking and prosocial behavior. \n\nTo correct for multiple comparisons, the spatial autocorrelation function (acf) option was used in AFNI\u2019s 3dFWHMx to estimate intrinsic smoothness. The individual-level residuals were entered into 3dFWHMx along with the brain mask. Because real fMRI data does not have a true Gaussian-shaped ACF, 3dFWHMx estimates smoothness by fitting the ACF to a mixed model that is Gaussian plus mono-exponential. 3dClustSim was used to estimate the probability of false positives using 2-sided thresholding and the NN1 option using the corrected approach recommended by  . Cluster size corrections for multiple comparisons at a <\u00a00.05 over the whole brain were achieved at a voxel-wise threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a0.005. Results of the simulation yielded a voxel-wise threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a0.005 combined with a minimum cluster size of 208 voxels for the main effects, 197 voxels for the regression of risk-taking, and 204 voxels for the regression of prosocial behavior (given the different sample sizes), corresponding to p\u00a0<\u00a0.05, family-wise error corrected. The group level acf values were as follows: 0.546944793, 4.685530941, 12.73257414 (main effects); 0.549268783, 4.667489394, 12.68986948 (risk-taking); 0.547707491, 4.68737725, 12.67997578 (prosocial behavior). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Descriptive analyses \n  \nFirst, we examined correlations among adolescents\u2019 own popularity and their self-reported risk-taking and prosocial behaviors ( ). Adolescents\u2019 own popularity at wave 2 was correlated with their risk-taking behavior at wave 2 but was not associated with their prosocial behavior in either wave.   \nSummary statistics and correlations of all study variables. \n  Table 1     \n\n\n### Main effects of neural tracking of high popularity \n  \nTo examine the main effect of neural tracking of high popularity, we first conducted a random-effects, whole-brain analysis at the group level for the High Popularity condition (i.e., when viewing peers whose popularity was > 1\u00a0SD above mean), using popularity as a parametric modulator. We did not find main effects for any regions that linearly track increases in popularity. Instead, the precuneus, among other regions ( A), negatively tracked popularity, such that activation decreased as the popularity of target images increased.   \nMain effects for neural tracking of high and low popularity. \n  Table 2     \n\n\n### Main effects of neural tracking of low popularity \n  \nWe also conducted a random-effects, whole-brain analysis at the group level for the Low Popularity condition (i.e., when viewing peers whose popularity was < 1\u00a0SD below mean), using the absolute value of popularity as a parametric modulator. The insula and cingulate cortex, among other regions ( B) negatively tracked low popularity, such that these regions exhibited less activation for the least popular target images. \n\n\n### Neural tracking of high popularity and longitudinal links to risk-taking and prosocial behavior \n  \nOur primary analyses examined how individual differences in neural tracking of highly popular peers were associated with changes in adolescents\u2019 self-reported risk-taking and prosocial behavior over one year. In whole-brain analyses, we regressed self-reported risk-taking at wave 3 onto neural tracking of popularity, controlling for risk-taking at wave 2 as well as participants\u2019 own popularity at wave 2. \n\nNeural tracking of high popularity in the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was associated with changes in risk-taking behavior ( A). For descriptive purposes, we extracted parameter estimates of signal intensity from the dmPFC, where estimates reflect neural tracking of popularity (i.e., linear increases in the dmPFC as popularity increased). We plotted neural tracking of popularity in the dmPFC against risk-taking at wave 3 controlling for risk-taking at wave 2. As shown in  A, positive tracking (i.e., linear increases in activation) of high popularity in the dmPFC was associated with increases in risk-taking behaviors, whereas negative tracking (i.e., linear decreases in activation) of high popularity in the dmPFC was associated with decreases in risk-taking behaviors. We found no significant clusters for the regression of prosocial behavior onto neural tracking of high popularity.   \nNeural regions that linearly tracked high (A) and low (B) popularity that correlated with changes in (A) Risk-Taking and (B) Prosocial Behavior. \n  Table 3       \n(A) Neural tracking of high popularity in the right dmPFC correlates with increases in risk taking and (B) Neural tracking of low popularity in the right insula correlates with increases in prosocial behaviors. The x-axes represent neural tracking of popularity; values reflect the linear slopes of voxel activation with respect to 1-unit increases (A) or decreases (B) in popularity. The y-axes represent changes in behavior such that (A) indicates risk-taking at wave 3 controlling for risk-taking at wave 2, and (B) represents prosocial behavior at wave 3 controlling for prosocial behavior at wave 2. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n### Neural tracking of low popularity and longitudinal links to risk-taking and prosocial behavior \n  \nNeural tracking of low popularity in the right insula, midcingulate cortex (MCC), and sensorimotor cortex were associated with changes in prosocial behavior ( B).  For descriptive purposes, we extracted parameter estimates of signal intensity from the insula, where estimates reflect neural tracking of low popularity (i.e., linear increases in the insula as low popularity increased). We plotted neural tracking of low popularity in this region against prosocial behavior at wave 3 controlling for prosocial behavior at wave 2. As shown in  B, positive tracking (i.e., linear increases in activation) of low popularity in this region was associated with increases in prosocial behavior, whereas negative tracking (i.e., linear decreases in activation) of low popularity in this region was associated with decreases in risk-taking behaviors.  We found no significant clusters for the regression of risk-taking onto neural tracking of low popularity. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAdolescence is characterized by an increased sensitivity to peer status and social evaluation, as well as changes in behaviors that may increase an individual\u2019s peer status. This study evaluated how neural sensitivity to popular and unpopular peers in adolescents\u2019 school-based social networks was associated with changes in risk-taking and prosocial behavior. We identified regions wherein individual differences in neural tracking of popularity related to longitudinal changes in risk-taking and prosocial behavior. In particular, we found that adolescents who showed increased neural tracking to popularity in the dmPFC showed longitudinal increases in risk-taking behavior over the course of one year. Additionally, heightened sensitivity in the insula to participants\u2019 least popular peers was associated with increases in prosocial behavior. These results suggest that heightened neural sensitivity to popular and unpopular peers may influence the trajectories of risk-taking and prosocial behavior, respectively. \n\n### Neural sensitivity to high popularity is associated with risk-taking \n  \nGiven the clear link between popularity and risk-taking in adolescence ( ,  ,  ,  ), we hypothesized that greater neural sensitivity to popular peers would be associated with longitudinal increases in risky behaviors. Indeed, adolescents who showed increased neural tracking of popularity in the dmPFC at wave 2 were more likely to increase their risk-taking over the course of one year. Interestingly, those who showed lower neural tracking of popularity in the dmPFC (i.e., those who had higher neural activation in response to viewing their less popular peers) were more likely to decrease risk-taking behaviors over the same time period. The dmPFC is often associated with the process of mentalizing, wherein individuals consider the thoughts, beliefs and intentions of others, ( ). Additionally, in adolescence the dmPFC plays a large role in processing information about the self, and has also been activated when incorporating information about distant or dissimilar others ( ,  ). Thus, stronger neural tracking of popularity in the dmPFC could reflect a heightened tendency to consider the thoughts and beliefs of more popular (relative to less popular) peers, and potentially a higher tendency to incorporate these ideas into evaluations of the self. This could, in turn, lead to increases in behaviors that are typically characteristic of popularity in the peer group, such as risk-taking. Moreover, lower neural tracking of popularity was generally associated with decreases in risk-taking, which might suggest that lower mental state reasoning and consideration of the thoughts of popular peers is associated with less engagement in their characteristic behaviors. However, given that our fMRI task only involved the passive viewing of peers\u2019 faces, we cannot say for certain that our participants were engaged in the process of mentalizing or self-reference, and there may be other explanations for dmPFC activation. Importantly, we controlled for participants\u2019 own popularity given that individual\u2019s own peer status is associated with longitudinal increases in risk-taking ( ). Thus, our results suggest that adolescents\u2019 neural sensitivity to popularity is predictive of changes in their risky behavior beyond those explained by their own social standing. \n\n\n### Neural sensitivity to low popularity is associated with prosocial behavior \n  \nAlthough less is known about sensitivity to low popularity, previous studies have linked heightened neural sensitivity when witnessing rejection to prosocial behavior ( ,  ,  ). We found that increased tracking of low popularity in the insula predicted increased prosocial behavior over the course of one year. One potential explanation for this finding is that increased activation of these regions in response to the least popular peers reflects heightened affective empathy, and that this subserves increased tendencies for prosocial behavior in various contexts. Notably, we did not find similar effects for regions associated with the cognitive component of empathy, such as the mPFC or precuneus. Given that previous studies found activation in these regions when actually performing a prosocial action toward a rejected individual ( ), it may be the case that affective empathy subserves the increased tendency for prosocial behavior overall, whereas cognitive empathy is employed during specific instances of prosociality, particularly toward rejected or unpopular peers. \n\n\n### Addressing null results \n  \nAlthough caution must be exercised when interpreting null results, it is notable that, contrary to our hypotheses, no main effects were found for the high popularity condition in regions we hypothesized based off of findings in adults (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). This could potentially be the result of methodological differences (e.g., only evaluating tracking within high popularity, as opposed to across the full continuum) or developmental differences (e.g., adolescents may exhibit greater variance in neural tracking of popular peers than adults, such that some negatively track high popularity and others positively track it, resulting in a null main effect). In addition, no effects were found for regions of the brain associated with valuation, such as the vmPFC, VS, and amygdala. One potential explanation is that these regions may be engaged, but do not linearly track popularity, as measured by the parametric modulator. Alternatively, it may be the case that simply observing popular peers does not induce valuation, but rather that such activation is contingent on actions or feedback from these peers. Additionally, these regions are relatively small, and our task may not yield large enough activations to surpass our whole-brain threshold. \n\n\n### Contributions, limitations, and future directions \n  \nThis study has several strengths. While prior work has identified neural systems that track popularity in adults ( ,  ,  ), this study provides a novel contribution by assessing how individual differences in sensitivity to peer status in adolescents are associated with longitudinal changes in social behaviors. Moreover, this study is the first to gauge neural sensitivity to peer status and its behavioral correlates in early adolescence, when popularity is the most valued ( ) and most likely to influence behavior ( ). Additionally, we utilized a large longitudinal sample and robust sociometric data, allowing us to capture individual differences across multiple school social networks. Lastly, by using stimuli of peers from adolescent\u2019s real-world social networks, the Classmates task has high ecological validity and contributes to our knowledge of the social processes that underlie adolescents\u2019 status-related behaviors. \n\nNonetheless, the study has some key limitations. Primarily, while the relations between neural tracking of popularity and behavioral outcomes may lay groundwork for future theories, this study cannot determine mechanisms by which the two may be related. For example, to explain changes in risk-taking, it may be the case that greater sensitivity to popularity results in greater orientation toward the beliefs and behaviors of popular peers, which in turn leads to greater conformity to their ideals ( ). Alternatively, those who track popularity in the brain may be more likely to seek out friendships with popular peers, and in turn have increased social opportunities to engage in risk-taking. Individuals often strive to befriend peers who are more popular in order to enhance their own peer status ( ,  ,  ), so it is also possible that behavioral changes over the course of the year are the result of both peer status goals and changes in friendship networks. Additionally, risk-taking behavior was fairly low in our sample (means of 0.27 and 0.35 across two years on a 0\u20134 scale). While it is important to capture variance in risk-taking behavior in early adolescence ( ,  ), it is important to recognize these low rates and understand that our findings may not translate to populations whose risk taking is higher (such as older adolescents or those at greater risk for externalizing behavior and psychopathology). Lastly, it is important to recognize that risk-taking is not only affected by popularity, but also by other factors such as mood, interpersonal conflict, and social exclusion ( ,  ). Nonetheless, future studies should evaluate potential mediators, such as peer conformity or friendship network dynamics, that may explain the relations between neural sensitivity to peer status and risk-taking behavior. For understanding the link between sensitivity to low popularity and prosocial behavior, future work could probe whether increased prosociality is primarily directed toward rejected peers, or whether greater sensitivity to low popularity is indicative of stronger empathy and prosociality overall. Additionally, our task only involves the passive viewing of faces, so our ability to make inferences about broader social cognition and empathy processes is limited. To better understand the processes that underlie neural sensitivity to popularity, future work should investigate whether peer status sensitivity is associated with broader perspective taking and empathic abilities. Moreover, while our results held when controlling for participants\u2019 sex, it is well established that sex and gender play a large role in social status and its behavioral correlates, including risk-taking and prosocial behavior ( ,  ), so future studies may benefit from examining the moderating role of sex or gender. Lastly, our task does not include peers with average levels of popularity, so future studies should include this group for a full understanding of popularity tracking across the entire peer group. \n\nOverall, this research suggests that the neural mechanisms by which adolescents track popularity in real world social networks are related to behavioral changes relevant to peer status hierarchies. Given the importance of promoting positive prosocial behaviors and predicting dangerous risk behaviors in adolescence, this work advances a critical line of research that identifies how aspects of the peer environment interact with intraindividual neural systems to produce social behavior. \n\n\n\n## Data Statement \n  \nData Statement for: Adolescents\u2019 Neural Sensitivity to High and Low Popularity: Longitudinal Links to Risk-Taking and Prosocial Behavior fMRI results are publicly available at https://neurovault.org/collections/12724/ and other data and materials necessary to reproduce analyses are available upon request to the first author. \n\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest \n  \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10458690, "text_md5": "44633859163acf385cd412ef885b7307", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 148], "journal": [149, 166], "publication_year": [168, 172], "title": [183, 300], "keywords": [314, 376], "abstract": [389, 1322], "body": [1331, 44378]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 37595321, "doi": "10.1016/j.dcn.2023.101290", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10458690", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10458690"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10458690\">10458690</a>", "list_title": "PMC10458690  Adolescents\u2019 neural sensitivity to high and low popularity: Longitudinal links to risk-taking and prosocial behavior\u2606"}

To date, very few studies have explored how these behavioural observations are paralleled by functional brain development. Furthermore, currently no studies have explored the development of emotion modulation in these areas. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the brain activity of 25 children (age 6\u201311), 18 adolescents (age 12\u201317) and 26 adults while they passively viewed short videos of angry, happy or neutral body movements. We observed that when viewing dynamic bodies generally, adults showed higher activity than children bilaterally in the body-selective areas; namely the extra-striate body area (EBA), fusiform body area (FBA), posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), as well as the amygdala (AMY). Adults also showed higher activity than adolescents, but only in the right hemisphere. Crucially, however, we found that there were no age differences in the emotion modulation of activity in these areas. These results indicate, for the first time, that despite activity selective to body perception increasing across childhood and adolescence, emotion modulation of these areas in adult-like from 7 years of age. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nA vast literature indicates that the ability to correctly perceive emotions from other people doesn\u2019t reach adult levels until mid-adolescence ( ,  ). Moreover, the brain circuits specifically engaged while exposed to a stimulus depicting an emotion also undergo functional and structural changes in the period encompassing late childhood and adolescence ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). For instance, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have shown that fiber pathways connecting medial and lateral-temporal cortices are reorganized between childhood and adulthood ( ). From a functional point of view, event-related potentials (ERPs) studies have shown that the signature of emotion processing when viewing faces doesn\u2019t show adult patterns before the age of 14 ( ). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in adults also reveals evidence of emotion modulation in the face selective-areas of the visual cortex (fusiform face area, occipital face area, posterior superior temporal sulcus) ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) but not in children ( ,  ,  ), nor in adolescents ( ,  ). Yet, using angry and happy facial expressions,   found that young children (5\u20136 years old) displayed heightened amygdala activation in response to emotional faces relative to adults (see also  ).   expanded upon this by demonstrating that children (3.5\u20138.5 years old), but not adults (18+ years old), showed greater amygdala activation to happy rather than angry faces; although amygdala activation for angry faces increased with age.   reported that, when attention is unconstrained adolescents exhibit greater amygdala activity to fearful faces than adults, a finding replicated by  . For happy and angry faces, developmental differences were observed in the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. These data point to a developing emotion recognition system in which age is not simply an additive effect driving increased activation. Rather, the system, including occipitotemporal, limbic and prefrontal regions, shows preferential activation for different emotional expressions that change with age. \n\n### Body-selective areas \n  \nAll the aforementioned research has been conducted in relation to the perception of emotion from faces. However, emotion is also strongly conveyed by other means, in particular body posture and movements ( ,  ,  ). Previous work has shown that the capacity to recognize basic emotions from body movements also improves throughout childhood and adolescence ( ,  ,  ). The question of whether related brain processes also change during this time has not yet been addressed. \n\nSeveral brain areas have been identified as being specialized for the recognition and interpretation of human form and human motion: namely the extra-striate body area (EBA) located bilaterally in the lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC), the fusiform body area (FBA) and areas in the inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Research consistently reports modulation by emotion in the fusiform gyrus ( ,  ,  ,  ) and in the LOTC ( ,  ).   demonstrated that the strength of emotion modulation in these areas was related, on a voxel by voxel basis, to the degree of body selectivity, but showed no such relationship with the degree of BOLD response when viewing faces. In other words, the emotional signals from the body might \u2018modulate\u2019 the complexes of neurons that code for the viewed stimulus ( ), rather than providing an overall boost in activation for all visual processing in the extra-striate visual cortex. Furthermore, the same authors have shown that the modulation of body-selective areas in adults is also positively correlated with amygdala activation ( ). To our knowledge, brain response in children and adolescents when viewing emotional body stimuli has not yet been tested. \n\n\n### Development of body-selective areas \n  \nTo date, only three fMRI studies have explored the structural and functional development of the body-selective regions in children. While two of them reported that body-selective activity within the EBA and FBA was similar (in terms of location, intensity and extent) in children older than 7 and in adults ( ,  ), we found that it was not yet adult-like in pre-pubertal children (age 7\u201311;  ). The latter study mirrors findings in the face-selective regions in the ventral stream, which take more than a decade to mature ( ,  ). Of the other two studies, only   included adolescent subjects but did not distinguish them from children in their group analysis, potentially masking any differences between the two age groups. Therefore the question remains open as to how the brain responds to viewing body movements during adolescence. Moreover, it is unknown how this brain activity would be modulated by the emotion conveyed by these stimuli. Given that emotional abilities, including emotion perception from social signals, change significantly during adolescence, we might expect different pattern of brain activity in adolescents compared to children and adults. \n\n\n### Current study \n  \nHere, building upon our previous data collected in pre-pubertal participants ( ), our goal was to investigate, for the first time, the functional development of the EBA, pSTS, FBA and amygdala in relation to the perception of emotional human body movements across childhood and adolescence. Based on the developmental results reported for facial expression perception ( ,  ,  ,  ), we hypothesised that the activity and emotion modulation of the body-selective areas in the visual cortex would develop along a similar protracted trajectory. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nForty-six primary and secondary school participants were recruited from local schools and after-school clubs in the West End of Glasgow. Three of the younger children were excluded because of excessive head motion in the scanner. Thus data from 25 children (aged 6\u201311 years: M\u202f=\u202f9.55 years, SD 1.46, 13 females) and 18 adolescents (aged 12\u201317: M\u202f=\u202f14.82, SD\u202f=\u202f1.88, 9 females) were analysed. Children were all at Tanner stage 1\u20132, that is, pre-pubertal, as assessed using the Pubertal Developmental Scale ( ), a sex-specific eight-item self-report measure of physical development (e.g. growth in stature, breast development, pubic hair, etc.) filled in by parents. Adolescents were all Tanner stage 3\u20135; i.e., pubertal or post-pubertal but not yet adults. Binning our subjects in this way avoids arbitrary adolescence age ranges and allows us to have homogenous groups in term of pubertal status. Permission was obtained from managers of after-school clubs and/or head teachers in order to promote the study. Written consent was then obtained from each child's parent or guardian before testing began (adolescents aged 16 and over were able to provide their own consent). The study was in line with the declaration of Helsinki, was approved by the local ethics board, and all participants understood that participation was voluntary and signed a consent-form. A sample of 26 adult volunteers recruited from the University of Glasgow also took part (aged 18\u201327 years: M\u202f=\u202f21.28 years; SD\u202f=\u202f2.11, 15 females). This gave us 69 subjects in total. \n\n\n### Stimuli and procedure \n  \nForty-five short video-clips were taken from a larger set created and validated by  . Each clip depicted one actor, dressed in black against a green background, moving in an angry, happy or neutral manner. Six actors were males and nine females, with each actor recorded three times for each of the three emotions. The videos were recorded using a digital video camera and were edited to two-second long clips (50 frames at 25 frames per second). The faces in the videos were masked with Gaussian filters so that only information from the body was perceived (for full details and validation of stimuli (see   and  )). In addition, to use as control stimuli, we selected videos depicting non-human moving objects (e.g. windscreen wipers, windmills, metronomes, etc.) from the internet. We edited these clips using Adobe Premiere so that they matched the body stimuli in terms of size, resolution, and luminance. A green border matching the colour of the human video background was added. In the fMRI experiment, stimuli were presented in blocks of five clips (10\u202fs). \n\nFurthermore, to control for potential low-level parameters effects on fMRI activity, we computed one measure of low-level local visual motion in the clips in order to enter it as a covariate in our fMRI regression analysis. In each clip, we first calculated frame-to-frame change in luminance in the background as a surrogate measure of noise level. Then for each pair of consecutive frames we counted the number of pixels where the change in intensity was higher than noise. We averaged these numbers yielding one value per clip, representing the motion in this clip. This measure showed a high correlation with measures of perceived motion in the clips (  r  \u202f=\u202f.571,   n  \u202f=\u202f61,   p  \u202f<\u202f.001). Then we computed the cumulative motion for the five clips in each block. Overall the blocks of non-human clips had slightly more motion than the blocks of body movements clips, although this was not statistical significant (  t  (16)\u202f=\u202f1.89,   p\u202f  =\u202f.076). In the emotion clips we found a significant difference in movement between the angry and neutral body expressions (  t\u202f=\u202f  3.78,   p  \u202f<\u202f.005) only. To control for these effects these measures were added a covariate in our fMRI analysis. \n\n Data acquisition:   We acquired a series of 246 images of brain activity using a 3\u202fT fMRI scanner (Tim Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 32-channels head coil, using standard EPI sequence for functional scans (TR/TE: 2600\u202fms/40\u202fms; slice thickness\u202f=\u202f3\u202fmm; in plane resolution\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202fmm). In addition, we performed a high-resolution T1-weighted structural scan (1\u202fmm  3D MPRAGE sequence) for anatomical localization. \n\n Main experiment:   The experiment was programmed with MATLAB using the Psychophysics Toolbox Extensions ( ). An experimental run consisted of 48 10-seconds long blocks: eighteen blocks of non-human stimuli (10\u202fs; 5 clips), eighteen blocks of human stimuli (three blocks of each emotion) and twelve 10-seconds-long blocks of blank screen as a baseline, in a pseudo-randomized order based on an m-sequence avoiding correlation effects between blocks ( ). Stimuli were back-projected onto a screen positioned at the back of the scanner bore. Participants were able to view the screen thanks to a mirror attached to the head-coil. They were instructed to maintain their gaze in the centre of the screen. \n\n Procedure:   Participants were installed comfortably in the scanner. Head motion was restricted by comfortable but tight padding. Parents/guardians were allowed to sit next to their children in the scanning room if they or their child wished (this was the case for three subjects). During the set up and the structural scan they watched a cartoon or movie of their choice. They were first familiarized with the scanner environment and noise with a 3-minutes dummy scan (with the same parameters as the experimental scan), during which they watched a movie. After that we gave them feedback on their head motion and, if head motion was an issue, redid a dummy scan encouraging them to keep still. \n\nBefore the main experiment started they were reminded to pay careful attention to the stimuli, to look at the central fixation cross and to keep their head still. Following the scan they were given a short forced-choice emotion recognition task using the same stimuli to gauge their understanding of the emotional content of the stimuli. There was no difference between age groups in emotion recognition accuracy (mean accuracy: 89%, 85% and 89% for children, adolescents and adults respectively;   F  (2,67)\u202f=\u202f.787,   p  \u202f=\u202f.46). Some of the subjects (16 children, 15 adolescents and 18 adults) also participated in another independent 8-min functional scan during the same scanning session, before completing the structural scans. This scan was a passive temporal voice area localizer and was counter-balanced with the current experimental scans to avoid any influence or confound on the current study. \n\n\n### Pre-processing \n  \nWe used SPM 8 (Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience;   www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm  ) to process and analyse the MRI data. The functional data were corrected for motion by using a two-pass procedure. First we estimated the rigid-body transformation necessary to register each image to the first one of the time series and applied this transformation with a 4th Degree B-Spline interpolation. Then we averaged all these transformed images and repeated the procedure to register all images to the mean image. Movement correction was allowed up to 2\u202fmm translation or 2 degrees rotation; the three participants who had larger head motion were excluded from the analysis. The realigned functional data were co-registered with the individual 3D T1-weighted scan. First we identified AC-PC landmarks manually and estimated the affine transformation from the mean functional image to the structural image. Then this transformation was applied to the whole realigned time series. \n\nThe anatomical scans were then segmented for different tissue types and transformed into MNI-space using non-linear registration. The parameters from this transformation were subsequently applied to the co-registered functional data. \n\nNormalising the data from adults, adolescents and children into the same stereotactic template allowed us to directly compare the strength and extent of activation across age groups. Several studies examining the feasibility of this approach have found no significant differences in brain foci locations when the brains of children as young as 6 were transformed to an adult template ( ,  ). These findings, and the careful inspection of the normalized images (looking for abnormalities in cortex/ventricle location, etc.), gave us confidence that there is no confound of brain size in our results. \n\nBefore performing the analyses we smoothed the data using a Gaussian kernel (8\u202fmm FWHM). High-pass temporal filtering was applied at a cut off of 128\u202fs to remove slow signal drifts. \n\n\n### Whole brain analysis \n  \nA general linear model was created with one predictor of interest for each of the four conditions (Happy, Angry, Neutral, Non-Body). We added our measure of luminance change (video clip motion) as a covariate, allowing us to control for the increased motion in the anger body movements. The six head-motion parameters were also added as regressors of non-interest. The model was estimated for each participant and we computed the following contrasts of interest between individual parameter estimates: Body\u202f>\u202fNon-Human; Angry\u202f>\u202fNeutral; and Happy\u202f>\u202fNeutral. These contrast images were taken to second-level random effect analysis of variance (ANOVA) to create group-averages separately for children, adolescents and adults and to compare the three groups. For the main group comparison analyses (One-way ANOVA and subsequent post-hoc   t-  tests for each contrast), resulting statistical maps are presented using a threshold of   p  \u202f<\u202f.05 after Familywise error (FWE) correction at the voxel level and a cluster extent of a minimum of 10 voxels. Anatomical locations for the peak functional activations were determined with the help of the Harvard-Oxford cortical and sub-cortical structural atlases as implemented in FSLview ( ). Unthresholded statistical maps are available at  . \n\n\n### Region of interest (ROI) definition and analysis \n  \nIn order to directly address our hypotheses, we focused on six \u2018body\u2019 areas identified in   (bilateral EBA, FBA and pSTS) and tested whether their activity was modulated by the emotional content of the body movement across ages, as it is the case in adults ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). ROIs encompassing these areas were created by taking the set of contiguous voxels within a sphere of radius 8\u202fmm surrounding the voxel in each anatomical region that showed the highest probability of activation in a meta-analysis of 20 studies examining contrasts between moving body and controls in adults (detailed in  ). We also included ROIs covering the amygdala (AMY) bilaterally in the analysis. These were defined using the WFU PickAtlas software within SPM ( ). \n\nTo explore differences in the strength of activity in these ROIs across age groups, we extracted the peak   t  -value from each ROI in each participant for the Body\u202f>\u202fNon-Human, Angry\u202f>\u202fNeutral and Happy\u202f>\u202fNeutral contrasts. We chose the peak   t  -value rather than mean/median ROI response as the peak has been shown to correlate better with evoked scalp electrical potentials than averaged activity ( ). Furthermore, the peak is guaranteed to show the best effect of any voxel in the ROI and is unaffected by spatial smoothing and normalization. Lastly, a lowest mean activity in the children and adolescent group will be confounded by the fact that the extent of activation differs across groups ( ,  ), and that the ROIs are defined based on meta-analysis of studies conducted in adults, leaving the possibility of not capturing exactly the same ROI in children. Individual peak-  t   values for each ROI were entered into 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f8 mixed-design ANOVAs, with Age Group and ROI as between and within subject factors respectively. Furthermore, to explore more subtle effects over childhood and adolescence, we also performed further peak   t  -value analyses using age as a continuous variable. This can be found in the Supplementary Material. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Version 22. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Whole brain contrasts \n  \n#### Bodies\u202f>\u202fNon-Human \n  \n##### Within groups \n  \nIn adults, viewing dynamic bodies compared to non-human stimuli elicited activation in the right fusiform gyri (including FBA), bilateral pSTS, bilateral occipitotemporal cortices (including EBA), bilateral amygdalae, right inferior frontal gyrus, right precuneus and right precentral gyrus. \n\nAdolescents displayed activation in the bilateral occipitotemporal cortices, bilateral superior temporal sulcus, but at our FWE corrected threshold showed no significant activation in the fusiform gyri or amygdalae. \n\nChildren also showed similar activation locations as the adults in the right hemisphere, but showed no significant activation in the left occipitotemporal cortex, left fusiform gyrus, left posterior superior temporal sulcus or left amygdala (  and  ).   \nBrain activity when contrasting Bodies\u202f>\u202fNon-Human stimuli in Children, Adolescents and Adults.

Adults also showed increased activity over adolescents in the rEBA, rFBA and rAMY (rEBA:   p  \u202f  <  \u202f  .  005; rFBA:   p  \u202f  <  \u202f  .  001; rAMY:   p  \u202f  <  \u202f  .  05). No difference between adolescents and children reached significance. \n\nExploring the significant hemisphere and age group interaction, post-hoc analysis of hemisphere differences at each age group revealed significantly more right hemisphere activity in all three age groups (Children:   t  (99)\u202f=\u202f6.7,   p  \u202f<\u202f.001; adolescents:   t  (71)\u202f=\u202f5.6,   p  \u202f<\u202f.001; Adults:   t  (103)\u202f=\u202f8.4,   p  \u202f<\u202f.001). We found that there was no significant difference in the right hemisphere between children and adolescents (  p  \u202f=\u202f.516), but more activity in adults than both children (  p  \u202f<\u202f.001) and adolescents (  p  \u202f<\u202f.001). In the left hemisphere there was no significant activity difference between children and adolescents (  p  \u202f=\u202f.063) or adults and adolescents (  p  \u202f>\u202f.99) but adults showed significantly more activation than children (  p  \u202f<\u202f.001). \n\n\n#### Emotional Bodies\u202f>\u202fNeutral Bodies \n  \nTo explore the developmental trajectories of emotion modulation we broke down the \u2018Bodies\u2019 condition into the 3 emotions (Angry, Happy and Neutral).

We found no significant difference between Angry and Happy. \n\nWe found a main effect of hemisphere (  F  (1,66)\u202f=\u202f79.5,   p  \u202f<\u202f.001,   \u03b7  \u202f=\u202f.55) driven by significantly higher peak   t   values in the right hemisphere overall. \n\nWe found a significant interaction between ROI and emotion (  F  (6,396)\u202f=\u202f29.6,   p  \u202f<\u202f.001,   \u03b7  \u202f=\u202f.31) and a significant interaction between ROI and hemisphere (  F  (3,198)\u202f=\u202f10.8,   p  \u202f<\u202f.001,   \u03b7  \u202f=\u202f.14). \n\nCrucially, however, none of these effects showed any interaction with age (Emotion\u202f\u00d7\u202fAge   F  (4,132)\u202f=\u202f.37,   p  \u202f=\u202f.83,   \u03b7  \u202f=\u202f.01; Hemisphere\u202f\u00d7\u202fAge   F  (2,66)\u202f=\u202f2.2,   p  \u202f=\u202f.123,   \u03b7  \u202f=\u202f.06; ROI\u202f\u00d7\u202fEmotion\u202f\u00d7\u202fAge   F  (12,396)\u202f=\u202f1.06,   p  \u202f=\u202f.39,   \u03b7  \u202f=\u202f.03; ROI\u202f\u00d7\u202fHemisphere\u202f\u00d7\u202fAge   F  (6,198)\u202f=\u202f1.6,   p  \u202f=\u202f.136,   \u03b7  \u202f=\u202f.05). \n\nConsidering Age as a continuous variable, rather than a grouping factor, yielded the same results (presented as Supplementary Material). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe investigated the development of the body-selective areas in the visual cortex and their modulation by emotion by comparing brain activity in adults, adolescents and children passively viewing angry, happy and neutral body movements, as well as objects\u2019 movements. The present results show that, as expected, adults display bilateral activity in the main body-selective areas of the visual cortex (EBA, FBA and pSTS) when viewing dynamic bodies compared to non-human stimuli. For the same contrast, adolescents showed activity in the bilateral EBA and STS, and children in all three areas, but restricted to the right hemisphere. Whole-brain analyses revealed an additional main effect of age-group in the bilateral LG driven by higher activation in the children and adolescents compared to adults. Adults showed higher peak   t  -values than children in all the body-selective ROIs except the lFBA, and higher peak   t  -values than adolescents in the right ROIs (rEBA, rFBA and rAMY) except the right pSTS. This result complements our previous work ( ) while showing that in these regions the magnitude of activity is still lower than adults in adolescents aged 12\u201317. \n\nIn terms of emotion modulation, and contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find any difference between age groups when contrasting Angry or Happy body movements to Neutral body movements: all three age-groups showed similar difference in activation in the body-selective areas and amygdala when viewing emotional compared to non-emotional stimuli. \n\n### Body-selective areas in adolescents and children \n  \nThis is the first study to compare body-selective areas in children, adolescents and adults. When contrasting viewing dynamic bodies to viewing non-human movements, we found similar body-selective areas in children, adolescents, and adults. Interestingly, both children and adolescents showed higher activation in the bilateral LG compared to adults. The LG has been identified as having a role in various higher-level visual functions such as word processing ( ), complex visual processing ( ), and most relevant to this study, the perception of human biological motion ( ,  ,  ,  ). Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), ( ) found that fiber tracts in the ventral stream differed between adults (aged 20\u201330) and children (aged 5\u20137). They found no difference in the fiber tract volume, but instead showed that adults had additional connections to posterior lateral areas (OTC), whereas children showed additional connections to posterior medial areas (LG). In other words, the ventral visual system was \u2018adult-like\u2019 in terms of fiber tract volume, but these differences in connection trajectories between children and adults suggests a reorganisation of fiber pathways from medial to lateral-temporal cortex. Thus our data may illustrate developmental differences in processing pathways that could be linked to structural immaturities. Presumably this reorganisation is also not complete by adolescence, as our adolescent group showed the same effect.   also showed that ventral stream connections to the right fusiform gyrus (containing the FBA) seem to not be completely established in their sample of 5\u20137 year old children. They suggest that the fiber bundles to the lingual visual areas of the cortex in children may prune until adulthood due to experience-based plasticity. This could explain our finding of increased activity in the LG of children and adolescents as compared to adults when viewing body stimuli. Unfortunately their study can shed no light on the functionality of this reorganisation, but it remains plausible then that the fiber tracts in children allow for visual stimuli to reach cortex dedicated to visual memory and language centres. As the child gets older and cerebral architecture is shaped by experience, more fiber bundles develop leading to the OTC, an area specialised in processing visual categories ( ). This could be reflected in our uncorrected threshold maps, which seem to suggest that the adults, but not the children, show more activity in these areas when viewing objects compared to bodies motion. \n\nThe ROI analyses revealed higher sensitivity (represented by higher peak   t  -values) in adults than children in all ROIs except the lFBA. The adolescents, however, only showed significantly lower peak   t  -values than the adults in the rEBA, rFBA and rAMY. Given that these three regions also showed a significant difference between adults and children, but no difference between children and adolescents, one could argue for a developmental trajectory that is either so gradual during childhood and adolescence that it is undetectable here, or is simply flat, with maturation occurring at the end of adolescence. \n\nIt is notable that these developmental differences occur in the right hemisphere. This may partially support the right lateralisation we previously reported in children viewing body stimuli ( ), and those observed in children using other modalities such as face stimuli ( ) or voice processing ( ,  ). The literature, however, presents a mixed picture with some authors reporting that the cortex becomes less lateralised over age ( ), increases in lateralisation ( ), or in the case of  , a full reversal of lateralisation. Here we find that right lateralisation in our ROIs is present in children and continues through adolescence into adulthood. Altogether, our lateralisation results point towards a stronger activation and later maturation of body-related activity in the right compared to the left hemisphere. This might be related to the change in relative specialization of the different sub-regions of the ventral visual-occipital cortex during literacy maturation and development of the cortex sensitive to words in the left hemisphere ( ), although this would need to be tested more specifically. \n\n\n### Emotion modulation of the body-selective areas \n  \nSimilar to the Body\u202f>\u202fNon-Human contrast, the Angry\u202f>\u202fNeutral and Happy\u202f>\u202fNeutral contrasts produced activity in the body-selective areas. Interestingly, none of the significant main effects or interactions showed any interaction with age. So, contrary to the increase in activation over age in the Body\u202f>\u202fNon-Human contrast, the whole-brain Angry\u202f>\u202fNeutral and Happy\u202f>\u202fNeutral contrasts and ROI analyses revealed no age differences in emotion modulation of the body selective areas, and no age differences in amygdala response. This rules out an attentional explanation for our Body\u202f>\u202fNon-Human age differences. If the children were showing significantly lower peak   t  -values due to paying less attention to the stimuli than the adults or adolescents, one would expect that effect to be present in the emotion modulation analysis as well. Furthermore, ( ) demonstrated that, when presented with socially meaningful stimuli, the body-selective areas were the most active when subjects were not attending the stimulus. Thus, a lack of attention from the children to the stimuli in the current study would manifest itself in the data as greater activation in the body-selective areas (in the context of socially meaningful stimuli). The fact that this isn\u2019t the case in our data and we see no age differences in activation for our emotional contrasts leads us to rule out an attentional explanation. \n\nThese findings suggest that even though the body-selective areas are increasing in their levels of recruitment between childhood and adulthood for processing dynamic body stimuli, the emotion modulation of these areas is already adult-like in children. This seems to be in accordance with previous behavioural results into emotion recognition from body movements ( ,  ). We previously described a sharp rise in emotion recognition accuracy from full-light human body movements between the ages of 4 and 8.5 years old ( ). After 8.5 years we found a much slower rate of improvement in recognition accuracy. In the current study our children subjects range from 6 to 11 years old, so as a group they might be indistinguishable from the adult group in terms of recognition accuracy. In which case finding no age difference in the amygdala response and emotion modulation of the body-selective areas should come as no surprise (indeed, there was no significant age difference in the brief post-scan behavioural emotion recognition task we performed here). It is also possible that the age differences in behavioural performance are linked to the differences in other brain functional circuits (e.g. executive function). It could be the case, as shown using happy and angry faces in  , that 5\u20136 year old children would show heightened amygdala response to emotional bodies as compared to adults. Indeed, there is evidence that children younger than 6 years of age tend to analyse faces and bodies featurally, whereas older children (like the children in the current study) analyse expressions that include facial and postural cues holistically ( ). Exploring these questions in relation to emotional body perception would be a worthwhile extension of the current study; however, brain-imaging data from very young children (4\u20136 years old) would be needed to explore this possibility. \n\nA question that cannot, by design, be addressed with our data is whether pubertal status could modulate brain response to body stimuli and its modulation by emotion. Indeed, during adolescence chronological age and sexual maturation interact in complex manners on their effect on brain structure and functions ( ,  ,  ). In particular, a few studies addressing the development of emotional face processing suggest an effect of puberty even after accounting for age ( ,  ), especially expressed as a reduction in amygdala response to emotion as puberty progresses during mid-adolescence (review in  ). This effect is very small however, and not observed for all markers of puberty ( ). Also, it is not observed in many behavioural studies of basic emotion recognition ( ,  ). In light of the current evidence, we do not predict that pubertal status would influence activity related to body perception, and that is why we chose to equate this factor within each age group and focus on age effect. Nevertheless, adequately powered studies for this question could investigate whether puberty and related hormonal changes could have an effect similar to the one suggested for face perception. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nA key direction for future research using dynamic body stimuli is exploring the relative importance of several kinematic and postural body features in the classification of affective body movements. Recent evidence using our stimuli suggests that body movements differentially activate brain regions based on their postural and kinematic content ( ). This work tells us in more detail which features of the stimuli carry the critical information for emotion perception, and will allow further investigation into their developmental trajectories. Additionally, due to the dynamic nature of our stimuli, an alternative explanation for our age-related increase in body-selective area activity could be differences in sensitivity to moving stimuli across age. However, recent evidence suggests no difference between children and adults in areas related to motion perception; namely the human motion complex (hMT+) ( ). Here our study was not designed to test this possibility but we know that there is overlap between hMT+ and EBA ( ) and that these areas are dissociable ( ), therefore future work could perform motion sensitivity control analyses on the dissociated occipital motion area (OMA) to explore any potential age-related motion sensitivity differences. \n\nOne further potential limitation here is that as we define our body-selective areas through a meta-analysis of adult studies ( ) rather than a standard static body-selective area localizer scan, one could argue that rather than reflecting age-related changes in activation for dynamic bodies, rather, our results reflect age-related changes in the precise location of body-selective areas. We do not believe this to be the case however, as we have previously shown that the average MNI coordinates of the highest positive   t  -value in each of the body-selective meta-analysis defined ROIs were similar in children and adults, confirming that these regions occupy the same cortical space ( ). We have also previously shown that the spatial extent of fMRI signal change is larger in these regions in adults compared with pre-pubertal children. Therefore at our stringent   p  \u202f<\u202f.05 FWE corrected (10 voxel cluster extent) threshold for whole-brain analysis we might expect to see differences in age related functional changes compared to our optimal peak   t  -value analyses, as the peak is guaranteed to show the best effect of any voxel in the ROI and is unaffected by spatial smoothing, normalization, and extent of activation (or lack thereof). Future work could investigate this further by performing localizer scans to identify static body-selective areas in each subject and then performing peak   t  -extraction analyses on each individual's body-selective areas. However, given our previous findings detailed above regarding highest positive peak   t  -value coordinates occupying the same cortical space, we would predict very similar results to our own. \n\nFinally, a passive viewing task such as the one employed here cannot address the function of the body-selective system. Using point-light displays,   showed evidence that emotionally expressive movements do not solely modulate the neuronal populations that code the viewed stimulus category. This implies that a body-selective area that is responding more to emotional compared to neutral stimuli may only be doing so due to top-down influence from some higher cortical area.   provided evidence, in adults, of amygdala activation as well as activation in the fusiform areas when presented with angry body actions. They attribute this to the brain's natural response to threat, which has been replicated ( ) and mirrored in primate studies ( ). So, if the stimuli do not modulate the body-selective areas directly, is there any influence from the amygdala? Or, in other words, do the emotional cues contained in the stimuli produce amygdala activity that in turn activates category-specific populations of neurons in the visual cortex? Future work should be designed specifically to test these possibilities. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nTo summarise, we found evidence that the body-selective areas of the visual cortex are not adult-like bilaterally in children and not adult-like in the right hemisphere in adolescents, when considering their responses to dynamic stimuli. Further, we present evidence, for the first time, of emotion modulation in these areas in children and adolescents. We found that emotion modulation of the body-selective areas activity was increased in response to body movements conveying an emotion, positive or negative, compared to neutral movements to the same extent in children and adolescents than in adults. This mirrors various behavioural findings showing that, by the age of 8 years, children recognize emotion from bodily cues with the same proficiency as adults. These data provide new directions for developmental studies focusing on emotion processing from the human body, and could have clinical applications in both typically and atypically developing populations showing deficits in socio-emotional abilities. \n\n\n## Conflict of interest \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6969350, "text_md5": "aa228502184a2eb6a3737438d00b7dfc", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 82], "journal": [83, 100], "publication_year": [102, 106], "title": [117, 187], "keywords": [201, 281], "abstract": [294, 2012], "body": [2021, 46017]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 31128318, "doi": "10.1016/j.dcn.2019.100660", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6969350", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6969350"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6969350\">6969350</a>", "list_title": "PMC6969350  Emotion modulation of the body-selective areas in the developing brain"}

Adolescent participants from an entire school district (  N  \u2009=\u2009873) completed peer sociometric nominations of their grade at school, and a subset of participants (  N  \u2009=\u2009117,   M  \u2009=\u200913.59\u2009years) completed a neuroimaging task in which they viewed peer faces from their social networks. We revealed two neural processes by which adolescents track social preference: (1) the fusiform face area, an important region for early visual perception and social categorization, simultaneously represented both peers high in social preference and low in social preference; (2) the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which was differentially engaged in tracking peers high and low in social preference. No regions specifically tracked peers high in popularity and only the inferior parietal lobe, temporoparietal junction, midcingulate cortex and insula were involved in tracking unpopular peers. This is the first study to examine the neural circuits that support adolescents\u2019 perception of peer-based social networks. These findings identify the neural processes that allow youths to spontaneously keep track of peers\u2019 social value within their social network. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMost social species use knowledge about others to construct hierarchical social networks in which some individuals are highly accepted within the network (i.e. liked) and others are highly rejected (i.e. disliked;  ). For instance, animals often judge who is more attractive, preferred as a mate or cooperative. In turn, this self-organized social structure has significant effects on animals\u2019 social behaviors, well-being and survival by dictating who to approach and who to avoid (for review,  ). Indeed, individuals who are better at understanding social hierarchies and can adapt their social behaviors accordingly are more likely to survive and thrive ( ). Humans, like other social species, represent others\u2019 social value within their social hierarchies, and this ability may develop as early as infancy ( ;  ). Nonetheless, the importance of social value may peak in adolescence, when peer-based social rank becomes especially salient and has profound impacts on adolescents\u2019 social behaviors ( ;  ). Prior research has examined the neural representation of others\u2019 social value in adults (e.g.  ;  ;  ;  ), but no research to date has examined how adolescents neurally represent the social value of peers in their real-world social networks. Many brain systems undergo significant reorganization during adolescence (for review,  ), which may subserve the emergence of a social orientation towards peers and sensitivity to peer-based social hierarchies within networks. In the present study, we examine how the brains of adolescents represent their peers who vary in peer-nominated   social preference   (i.e.\u00a0whether peers are the most or least liked in their social network) and   popularity   (i.e.\u00a0whether peers are rated as the most or least popular in their social network), which are two important forms of peer status ( ). \n\n\n## Social hierarchies in adolescence \n  \nAdolescence is marked by an increased orientation towards peers ( ). This is manifested in multifarious social networks such as friendships, cliques and romantic relationships ( ). By early adolescence, peer groups start to become differentiated by peer status ( ;  ). Peer status in a network refers to an individual\u2019s socially ascribed value within a social network and can be predictive of a variety of important social attributes such as popularity and likability ( ). Adolescents tend to be more concerned with their social status among peers than are children and adults ( ;  ). Adolescents are also more motivated than children and adults to gain social status among their peers ( ) and to prioritize peers\u2019 status when selecting friends ( ). Adolescents\u2019 social milieu provides a critical developmental context for adolescents to practice social behavior (e.g. cooperation and competition) and to engage in self-exploration through social comparison ( ). Adolescents\u2019 representation of peers\u2019 social status also has implications for their own health behavior: adolescents are more likely to engage in risky behaviors when endorsed by high-status peers than low-status peers ( ;  ). Therefore, it is essential to understand the basic processes by which adolescents represent and assess peer status in order to understand how those processes may contribute to social behavior. \n\n\n## Neurobiological sensitivity to social hierarchies \n  \nDespite the significance of peer status to adolescents\u2019 social life ( ), relatively little is known about how the brains of adolescents spontaneously represent their peers\u2019 social status in a dynamic and ecological context. It is understood that adolescents are hyper-attuned to the peer-based social networks in their environments ( ;  ;  ), which is reflected in greater visual attention towards high social status peers ( ). These findings suggest that the visuoperceptual system becomes particularly sensitive to peer-based social hierarchies during adolescence, but no research to date has examined the neural processes that allow youths to represent varying levels of peer statuses in social networks. \n\nKeeping track of others\u2019 peer status within a network requires efficiently extracting, processing and integrating social information about peers ( ). Humans can make these important, yet computationally demanding, evaluations within milliseconds ( ,  ;  ). In adults, this ability is largely supported by neural systems involved in face processing, social evaluation, mentalizing and executive function ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ). Structural neuroimaging work in primates shows that the volume of these brain regions, including the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and superior temporal sulcus, are positively associated with the sizes of an individual\u2019s social networks (e.g.  ;  ;  ). Importantly, the function of these systems undergoes significant reorganization during adolescence (for review,  ;  ), which corresponds to the timeframe during which youths become highly sensitive to peer contexts (for review,  ;  ;  ). Therefore, brain development during this period may underlie the emergence of sensitivity to social hierarchies during adolescence. \n\nAlthough no prior research to date has investigated the neural tracking of social status in human adolescents, neural systems involved in face processing, social evaluation, mentalizing and executive function may also represent this social attribute of peers in adolescents. The first system includes regions involved in   face processing  . This spatially distributed set of regions includes core visual regions such as the fusiform face area (FFA) and occipital gyrus, and extended regions such as the anterior temporal lobe (ATL; e.g.  ;  ). The FFA can be further subdivided into the FFA1 and FFA2 (e.g.  ), which play a critical role in facial feature analysis and identity perception, respectively (e.g.  ;  ;  ). In addition, the FFA is also involved in the social categorization of emotions, gender, and race (e.g.  ;  ;  ). The occipital gyrus, which is critical for visual perception, elicits significantly greater activation when viewing high-status faces relative to low-status faces (e.g.  ). Finally, the ATL is broadly involved in semantic storage and retrieval and has been shown to represent social category knowledge ( ) and biographical information about targets (e.g.  ;  ). \n\nSecond, visually tracking social status may also engage regions involved in   social valuation and salience   such as the ventral striatum (VS) and amygdala. Past work suggests that the VS is implicated in assessing the motivational significance of visual stimuli (e.g.  ;  ;  ) and the affective value of peer-based group members (e.g.  ;  ;  ). The amygdala is more generally involved in detecting salient stimuli in the environment such as emotionally evocative stimuli or in-group faces (e.g.  ,  ;  ;  ;  ). The amygdala also plays an essential role in detecting the social status of group members and representing knowledge about social hierarchies (e.g.  ;  ;  ). \n\nFinally, tracking peers\u2019 social status might engage brain regions associated with   social cognition   such as the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and PFC. The TPJ is involved in judging group members\u2019 characteristics and inferring social members\u2019 mental states and intentions, as well as peer status (e.g.  ;  ). Moreover, the TPJ exhibits increased activity while viewing images of influential individuals compared to less essential individuals in adult networks (e.g.  ). Research has indicated that several subregions of the PFC may be involved in the recognition of group members\u2019 social values and regulation of social behaviors towards socially valued group members (for review,  ). For instance, the medial PFC (mPFC) is involved in social rank encoding (e.g.  ) and flexibly guides behaviors on the basis of hierarchical status in rodents (e.g.  ). In humans, the mPFC underlies the construction and representation of others\u2019 relative social value ( ), as well as reinforcement learning of human social hierarchies ( ). In addition, the mPFC is activated while adults perceive or make judgments about high peer status members (e.g.  ;  ). Another important subregion of the PFC is the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which underlies the perception of higher social hierarchies ( ;  ), and supports the regulation of behaviors towards individuals with high social status (for review,  ). \n\n\n## The present study \n  \nIn the present study, we examined the neural tracking of social status in adolescents\u2019 real-world social networks using a combination of sociometric nominations and neuroimaging techniques. One important form of peer status is   Social Preference  , or the extent to which an individual is on average liked   vs   disliked across other members of a social network ( ). Although social hierarchies can take many forms in humans, social preference (i.e. likability) is one of the most widely used metrics to understand peer status in adolescents\u2019 social world ( ;  ). A second form of peer status is   Perceived Popularity  , or the extent to which an individual is viewed as popular across other members of a social network, regardless of whether they are well-liked. Social preference (i.e. likeability) and perceived popularity are two different sociometric constructs and are only moderately correlated in adolescent samples ( ;  ). Indeed, not all popular adolescents are liked and not all unpopular adolescents are disliked ( ;  ). \n\nSociometric nominations are one of the most ecologically valid tools for investigating the structures of human social networks ( ;  ). While social hierarchies can be only observed behaviorally in the context of social interaction in children ( ), adolescents can perceive status hierarchies in their social ecology and characterize their social networks using multiple attributes, including which peers are most liked and least liked and most popular and least popular ( ).   Social Preference   is computed by assessing every person in a network for their preference scores for who they like the most and like the least. Social preference scores for each individual in a network are then calculated as the standardized difference between \u2018liked most\u2019 and \u2018liked least\u2019 nomination tallies, with positive scores (i.e.\u00a0above the mean) indicating high social preference and negative scores (i.e.\u00a0below the mean) indicating low social preference (Coie and Dodge, 1983).   Perceived Popularity   is similarly computed by assessing every person in a network for who they think is the most and least popular. Importantly, adolescents exhibit an extremely high level of consistency in their assessment of peer status within a network ( ;  ), suggesting that there is a fair amount of consensus about peers\u2019 social value within social networks. We thus measured social preference and perceived popularity using sociometric peer nominations in which 6th and 7th graders in three public middle schools reported on which of their classmates they liked the most and least and which of their classmates were the most and least popular ( ;  ). \n\nUsing the peer nominations, we created a novel fMRI paradigm, in which adolescents viewed their real-life peers\u2019 images, which were selected based on having sociometric ratings that were the highest and lowest on social preference and perceived popularity. We predicted that a peer\u2019s social status (e.g. social preference) would be spontaneously represented during the viewing of peer faces. We hypothesized two potential visuoperceptual strategies which allow adolescents to perceive their peer-based social hierarchies. First, adolescents may represent peers\u2019 social status via a single psychological dimension, which simultaneously represents both group members high in social status and group members low in social status (e.g. most liked and least liked peers). This may be critical for individuals to quickly decide their next move when navigating their social worlds (e.g. approach or avoidance; cooperation or competition). Second, individuals may represent peers high in social status in a unique fashion in which salience detection is preferentially engaged, allowing them to detect individuals who are central in a network and most likely to influence future behavior while allocating less attention to less socially valued group members (e.g.  ;  ). To investigate these possibilities, we first examined the brain regions that   similarly   track peers high in social status (e.g. most liked) and low in social preference (e.g. least liked). Next, we examined the brain regions that   differentially   track peers high and low in social status by contrasting representations of high-status and low-status peers. We conducted these analyses for social preference and popularity separately as these two are distinct sociometric constructs. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis report consists of data collection across two waves when participants were in the 6th and 7th grade (wave 1, 2016\u20132017 school year) and 7th and 8th grade (wave 2, 2017\u20132018 school year) in three public middle schools in the rural southeast United States. Sociometric nominations were obtained in school-based testing sessions at each wave. A total of 873 consented and assented adolescents participated in school-based assessments (including sociometric nominations) at wave 1. At wave 1, 148 adolescents were enrolled in fMRI data collection (see supplementary material for recruitment details). To account for attrition, an additional 30 participants were recruited at wave 2, during which the Classmates fMRI task was collected from January to September 2018. The resulting sample included 178 participants. \n\nOf the original 178 participants, 26 did not participate in the second wave, eight were unable to complete the scan due to braces, six were excluded due to technical errors during scanning, one quit the scanning session early, two were not from the school district and so did not have social network data and three participants were excluded from analyses for excessive head motion (> 2\u2009mm in any direction). Of these 132 participants, 15 7th grade participants from one school were excluded due to sociometric data calculation errors, which resulted in them seeing invalid stimuli. The final sample of participants included 117 adolescents ages 12\u201315\u2009years (  M  \u2009=\u200913.59,   SD  \u2009=\u20090.58). Sixty-one of the participants identified as female (52.6%) and participants endorsed diverse racial/ethnic identities (see\u00a0  for detailed demographic information). \n  \nDemographic information of adolescent participants \n    \n\n### Peer sociometric nominations \n  \nSociometric procedures were used to measure peer status during the school-based assessment (see supplementary material for school-based consent and assent procedures). During the school-based assessment, participants were given a full list of peers within their school and grade level and were asked to identify 1) whom they like the most, 2) whom they like the least, 3) who is the most popular and 4) who is the least popular. There was no limit to the number of peers they could nominate. Prior research suggests that the size of a social network may impact group members\u2019 social cognition (for review,  ); we thus provide basic demographic information about the school and network sizes to contextualize the current findings with previous findings in adult social network literature (e.g.  ). In our study, peer nominations were completed by 78.7% of students at School 1, 77.0% at School 2 and 89.2% at School 3. The numbers of students in each grade from each school who participated in this session ranged from 104 to 193 (School 1, 6th grade\u2009=\u2009164, 7th grade\u2009=\u2009109; School 2, 6th grade\u2009=\u2009124, 7th grade\u2009=\u2009104; School 3, 6th grade\u2009=\u2009193 and 7th grade\u2009=\u2009179). \n\nBased on adolescents\u2019 peer sociometric nominations, we calculated social preference and popularity scores for each individual. In line with past research ( ), the social preference and popularity scores were computed for each adolescent as the standardized differences score between nomination tallies (i.e.   z  -score of \u2018like the most\u2019 minus the   z  -score of \u2018like the least\u2019 and   z  -score of \u2018most popular\u2019 minus the   z  -score of \u2018least popular\u2019). This   z  -score is thus based on ratings relative to all other students within their school and grade. High   z  -scores (e.g.\u2009>\u20091) represent high social status (e.g. liked) peers and low   z  -scores (e.g. < \u22121) represent low social status (e.g. disliked) peers within the same school ( ). This sociometric procedure is considered the most ecologically valid and robust approach for assessing peer status among adolescents ( ). \n\n\n### Classmates\u2019 fMRI task \n  \nAdolescents who participated in the fMRI session completed a task-based fMRI face recognition task adapted from  , in which they viewed yearbook photos of their peers from their school and grade (See supplementary material for all fMRI visit procedures and scan acquisition parameters). The peer nominations collected during wave 1 were used to select the images of adolescents presented in the fMRI task, which was administered at wave 2. The associations between likability and popularity ratings across waves 1 and 2 are high (see  ), suggesting peer status is highly stable. Face stimuli were scanned and digitized (e.g. JPEG images) from school yearbooks from wave 1. Luminance and image size were standardized across images. Unlike some face recognition studies, we did not grayscale the picture, mask blemish or scars in the faces or crop out hair and clothing. Thus, images were as naturalistic as possible. Peer images were selected for the fMRI task based on their sociometric rating. To be selected as a face stimulus target for the task, the peer needed to have a sociometric   z  -score between 1 and 5 (representing 1\u20135 SD   above   the mean on social preference/popularity in their school and grade) or between \u22121 and \u22125 (representing 1\u20135 SD   below   the mean on social preference/popularity in their school and grade). The task was created using E-prime 2.0, and one version was made for each grade level within each school (six versions total for all subjects, see  ).   shows an example trial of the Classmates task. \n  \nExample trial of the classmates\u2019 fMRI task during scan. Each trial consists of a jittered fixation and a picture of the peer from the same school with participants. We did not obtain permission to display adolescent peers\u2019 faces; therefore, facial pictures from the developmental emotional face stimulus set ( ) are shown here. \n  \nThe task had four conditions: high social preference (i.e.   z  -score between 1 and 5 on social preference), low social preference (i.e.   z  -score between \u22121 and \u22125 on social preference), high popularity (e.g. z-score between 1 and 5 on popularity) and low popularity (i.e.   z  -score between \u22121 and \u22125 on popularity). Within each condition, there were 10 targets (i.e.\u00a040 targets for each participant), and we aimed for an equal number of boys and girls within each condition. Due to a data management error,   z  -scores for the targets in two of the six task versions were incorrect and did not fall within the criteria (i.e.   z  -score between\u2009\u00b1\u20091 and 5). Popularity and social preference (i.e. likability) scores were recalculated for the target images in these task versions. For one group of participants (n\u2009=\u200920), there were a sufficient number of target images that fit the criteria for each condition (High Popularity\u2009=\u20099, Low Popularity\u2009=\u20098, High Social Preference\u2009=\u20098, Low Social Preference\u2009=\u200910), so these participants were included, resulting in five groups of participants and study stimuli. For the other groups, there were an insufficient number of target images (e.g. as little as\u00a05) in the conditions, so these participants (n\u2009=\u200915) were excluded. The faces in each condition were equally divided by female and male adolescents. We also attempted to build a racially/ethnically diverse paradigm such that each condition contains some faces representing individuals from minoritized groups. Research suggests that social preference (i.e. likability) and popularity are two distinct but correlated sociometric constructs in adolescents ( ). For our stimuli, the correlation between social preference and popularity scores ranged from 0.36 to 0.68 (Group 1:   r  \u2009=\u20090.36,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05; Group 2:   r  \u2009=\u20090.68,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001; Group 3:   r  \u2009=\u20090.56,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001; Group 4:   r  \u2009=\u20090.42,   P  \u2009<\u20090.01, Group 5:   r  \u2009=\u20090.46,   P  \u2009<\u20090.005). The correlation between social preference and popularity scores in the larger dataset from which study stimuli were drawn was 0.46,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001. Each target belonged in only one sociometric category and there was no overlap between targets in the social preference and popularity conditions. We did so to maximize the difference between neural responses to sociometric likability and popularity and increase the statistical power in our analyses. No adolescent participants in this neuroimaging study were included as face stimuli. The average   z  -score within each condition was approximately 2 (absolute value; see  ). We ensured equal distributions of sociometric scores across schools and conditions for the stimuli. \n\nThe Classmates task consisted of 16 blocks, four blocks per condition, presented across two runs. The blocks were presented in a randomized order. Within each block, there were 10 targets chosen to comprise that condition. Peer faces within each block were shown in a fixed order using a randomization algorithm. Participants saw each face 4 times total (2 in each run), with each condition having 40 total trials each. To achieve the power for neuroimaging analysis on visual stimuli, we repeated each peer face across the conditions, in line with previous studies (e.g.  ;  ). We used a 1-back task to ensure that adolescent participants were paying attention to these visual stimuli during scanning, such that each block contained one target that appeared twice in a row. In addition, implicit inferences of social attributes from faces often require face identity recognition processes ( ,  ). A large body of work has shown that 1-back paradigms successfully elicit face identity recognition processes in which participants invoke a mental representation of face identity in the absence of percept ( ;  ;  ). Participants were instructed to press a button with their right pointer finger when a face repeated. Adolescents were not explicitly told to track peer status, which allows us to investigate how the brain spontaneously supports adolescents\u2019 awareness of peer-based social hierarchies in real-world networks. Each face was shown for 1750\u2009ms, and a fixation cross was jittered around an average of 2301\u2009ms (range: 565.8\u20134936.8\u2009ms; see\u00a0 ). We did not include a control condition (e.g. teenagers with equal social attributes from other social networks) to account for other social attributes as it may regress out the phenomenon of our research interest, given that other social attributes (e.g. facial attractiveness, trustworthiness) are inherently correlated with social status in humans ( ). \n\n\n### Neuroimaging analysis \n  \nIn line with the analysis protocol in our previous studies ( ;  ), different analysis packages were employed to take advantage of its own merits (e.g. SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) is proficient in parametric modulation). Preprocessing was conducted using FSL (FMRIB\u2019s Software Library, version 6.0;  ). See supplementary material for detailed preprocessing steps. \n\nIndividual level, fixed-effects analyses were estimated using the general linear model (GLM) convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function in SPM12 . Parametric modulation analysis was conducted to detect the linear relationship between the BOLD response and peer status. The task was modeled as event-related with four conditions: high popularity, low popularity, high social preference and low social preference. The absolute value of the sociometric rating for each target in each condition (i.e.\u00a0social preference score for the high and low social preference conditions; popularity score for the high and low popular conditions) was added as a parametric modulator (PM) at the trial level. Importantly, the sociometric ratings ranged from relatively lower to high scores within each condition, which allows us to examine whether adolescents\u2019 brains track variation in peer status. Original low social preference (i.e.\u00a0least liked) and low popularity scores were negative (i.e. \u22121 SD below the mean on likeability), and high social preference (i.e.\u00a0most liked) and high popularity scores were positive (i.e. +1 SD above the mean). In order to compare activation across the conditions, we took the absolute values and used these absolute values as PMs at the trial level. For instance, for the low social preference peer condition, this identifies brain regions that linearly increase in BOLD as the absolute value of low-likability scores increase (i.e.\u00a0more dislikable); for the high social preference peer condition, this identifies brain regions that linearly increase in BOLD as the absolute value of high-likability scores increase (i.e.\u00a0more likable). Each condition was modeled at the onset of the face stimulus and the duration equal to zero. Six motion parameters were modeled as regressors of no interest. The repeated faces in this 1-back Classmates task were treated as a separate condition and modeled as a contrast of no interest. TRs with motion greater than 0.5 frame-wise displacement were modeled as a nuisance regressor. Using the parameter estimates from the GLM, linear contrast images comparing each of the face conditions of interest were calculated for each subject for the contrasts including high social preference, low social preference, high social preference   vs   low social preference and low social preference   vs   high social preference. Similar contrasts were created for the high and low popularity conditions. All conditions were performed in one GLM. Individual subject contrasts were then submitted to random effects, group-level analyses using GLMFlex ( ), which corrects for variance-covariance inequality, removes outliers and sudden activation change in the brain, partitions error terms and analyzes all voxels containing data (  index.php/GLM_Flex). \n\nFirst, to investigate which brain areas show   similar   neural tracking of high social status (e.g. most liked) and low social status (e.g. least liked) peers, we conducted whole-brain analyses separately for high and low social preference conditions, with social preference scores (absolute values for high social preference and low social preference peers) as PMs for each condition. This allowed us to identify the brain regions that track (i.e.\u00a0linearly increase in activation) peers of increasing likability and decreasing likability. In a subsequent analysis, we performed a conjunction analysis to formally evaluate which regions from the maps generated for the high social preference and low social preference peer conditions had similar areas (i.e. voxels) of activation using AFNI 3dcalc program (  t  -value as 3.14 and corrected). Regions that were identified across both conditions were then masked for overlap and plotted for descriptive purposes. This conjunction analysis allowed us to identify the brain regions that track the representation of high social preference and low social preference via a single psychological dimension. Second, to investigate which brain regions show   unique   neural tracking of high social preference and low social preference peers, we contrasted the high social preference condition with the low social preference condition with social preference scores as PMs (i.e.\u00a0High social preference with PM\u2009  >  \u2009Low social preference with PM). This allowed us to identify brain regions that differentially tracked highly likable peers relative to dislikable peers (and vice versa). \n\nSimilar analyses were run for the popularity contrasts. Specifically, we conducted whole-brain analyses separately for high and low popularity conditions, with popularity scores (absolute values for high popular and low popular peers) as PMs for each condition. This allowed us to identify the brain regions that track (i.e.\u00a0linearly increase in activation) peers of increasing popularity and decreasing popularity. We also included exploratory analyses in our GLM for contrasting social preference and popularity with respective sociometric scores as PMs (i.e.\u00a0High social preference with PM\u2009>\u2009High popularity with PM, Low social preference with PM\u2009>\u2009Low popularity with PM, social preference with PM\u2009>\u2009popularity with PM and popularity with PM\u2009>\u2009social preference with PM).

Specifically, we first submitted the residuals generated from the random-effects, individual-level analysis to the 3dFWHMx program to calculate the spatial group smoothness, assuming an auto-correlation function (i.e. -acf). Based on these simulations, we determined a corrected threshold of two-sided   P\u2009  <\u20090.001, with a minimum cluster extent of 84 voxels, corresponding to   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, family-wise error (FWE) corrected. Whole-brain analyses for each contrast are available on NeuroVault ( ):  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Neural correlates of social preference \n  \n#### Similarity in neural tracking of peers high in social preference and low in social preference \n  \nTo investigate neural tracking of social hierarchies in adolescents, we ran whole-brain analyses for the high social preference and low social preference conditions separately, each with social preference scores as a PM. Neural tracking of peers with high social preference scores (i.e.\u00a0most liked peers) elicited significant activation in the occipital gyrus and bilateral FFAs (including FFA1 and FFA2). Neural tracking of peers with low social preference score (i.e.\u00a0least liked peers) elicited activation in the bilateral occipital gyrus and FFA (including FFA1 and FFA2). All main effect results are reported in\u00a0 . \n  \nBrain regions that exhibited activation for tracking social preference (likability) of peers \n    \nNotably, the FFAs (FFA1 and FFA2) were both activated while adolescents tracked high social preference and low social preference peers (see\u00a0 ), suggesting the FFA might be a critical region that represents both high and low peer status among adolescents. Our subsequent conjunction analysis confirmed that the regions that were simultaneously tracking high social preference and low social preference were bilateral FFA and occipital lobes (see\u00a0  and\u00a0 ). For descriptive purposes, we extracted parameter estimates (  \u03b2  ) from the FFA from the clusters that overlapped across both conditions and plotted the beta weights as a function of sociometric likability scores.   shows that adolescents exhibited linear increases in FFA activity as likability scores increased in the high social preference peer condition, and linear increases in FFA activity as likability scores decreased in the low social preference peer condition, indicating that both the highest and lowest likable peers elicited the greatest FFA activation. See   for the distribution of   \u03b2   values in each FFA as a function of peer status across participants. \n  \nBrain activation when tracking high and low social preference peers. (A) The high and low social preference peers (i.e.\u00a0most liked and least liked peers) are simultaneously represented in the fusiform face area (i.e. FFA). Data are thresholded at the voxel level   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 (2 sided) with a cluster threshold   k  \u2009=\u200984,   N  \u2009=\u2009117. To visualize, group-level activation to high social preference peers (orange cluster) and low social preference peers (blue cluster) are overlaid onto an MNI anatomical image using FSL. (B) Conjunction analysis with the same multiple comparison correction criteria shows that both high and low social preference peers are represented in the FFA. (C) To visualize how the FFA tracks peer social preference, we plotted the parameter estimates (  \u03b2  ) from the activated FFA in each condition.

Analyses at the whole-brain level showed that neural tracking of peers high in social preference (i.e.\u00a0most liked peers) differentially engaged the DLPFC, as well as the middle occipital lobe (see\u00a0 ). For descriptive purposes, we extracted parameter estimates (  \u03b2  ) from the DLPFC in the high social preference and low social preference peer conditions and plotted the beta weights as a function of sociometric likability scores.   shows that participants exhibited linear increases in the DLPFC as likability scores increased to peers high in social preference, whereas brain activation in this region decreased with decreasing likeability for peers low in social preference. No brain regions survived the predefined threshold for the low status\u2009>\u2009high status contrast.

No brain regions survived the predefined threshold for tracking of high popularity. Neural tracking of peers low in popularity (i.e.\u00a0unpopular peers) elicited increasing activation as unpopularity increased in the bilateral inferior parietal lobe (IPL; see\u00a0 ). However, there were decreases in activation as unpopularity increased in the bilateral insula, superior temporal lobes (i.e. TPJ) and midcingulate cortex (MCC) (see\u00a0  &  ).   shows that participants exhibited linear increases in the IPL as unpopularity scores increased (i.e.\u00a0peers became more unpopular), whereas brain activation in this region remained consistently low as popularity scores increased to peers high in popularity, suggesting the IPL tracks peers low in popularity.   shows that participants exhibited linear decreases in the bilateral insula, right MCC and right TPJ as popularity scores increased to peers low in popularity, whereas brain activation to peers high in popularity within this region remained consistent.   and   for the distribution of   \u03b2   values in the bilateral IPL, insula, right MCC, and right TPJ across participants.

To visualize how the IPL tracks peer low in popularity, we plotted the parameter estimates (  \u03b2  ) from the activated IPL in each condition (see  . The x-axis represents the absolute value of perceived popularity score, such that high   z  -scores represent the sociometric statuses of the most popular peers and the most unpopular peers, and the y-axis represents mean brain activation in the IPL. \n    \nBrain regions that exhibited activation for tracking popularity of peers \n      \nDecreasing neural tracking of peers in low popular peers.

To visualize how the brain regions track peer low in popularity, we plotted the parameter estimates (  \u03b2  ) from the activated regions in each condition (see   for distribution). The x-axis represents the absolute value of perceived popularity score, such that high   z  -scores represent the sociometric statuses of the most popular peers and the most unpopular peers, and the y-axis represents mean brain activation in the IPL. \n  \n\n#### Differential neural tracking of peers high in popularity and low in popularity \n  \nTo investigate whether brain regions uniquely track peers high in popularity and low in popularity, whole-brain   t  -tests were conducted to examine the main effects of high-popular\u2009>\u2009low-popular peers with absolute popularity scores added as a PM. Our results showed greater activation to high-popular relative to low-popular peers in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus and left MCC (see\u00a0 ). Given that the main effect for the low popular peers elicited decreases in activation as low popularity increased, this result suggests that low popular peers uniquely elicit decreases in activation. Moreover, we see greater activation to low-popular relative to high popular peers in the IPL. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAdolescence is a period marked by an increased focus on the salience of peer-based social hierarchies ( ). In this study, adolescent participants viewed images of peers from their social networks without being explicitly told to track their peers\u2019 social statuses (i.e.\u00a0social preference and popularity). Social preference (i.e. likability) and popularity scores of adolescents\u2019 peers were used as PMs in our neuroimaging analysis to examine whether and how neural activation tracks levels of peer status. We aimed to investigate which neural regions similarly track high and low social status peers and which neural regions uniquely track high and low social status peers. For social preference, we found that the FFA subregions (i.e.\u00a0FFA1 and FFA2) tracked both peers high in social preference and low in social preference. In contrast, the DLPFC differentially tracked peers high in social preference relative to peers low in social preference, such that the DLPFC exhibited increased activation to peers high in social preference as social preference scores increased (i.e.\u00a0more likeable), whereas decreased activation to peers low in social preference (i.e.\u00a0more dislikeable). For popularity, no regions similarly tracked peers high and low in popularity, whereas the TPJ, MCC, insula, and angular gyrus (i.e. IPL) specifically tracked the degree of unpopularity amongst lowly popular peers. Taken together, these neural findings indicate that adolescents spontaneously track social hierarchies amongst their peers and suggest that different brain regions may jointly represent and assess peer status.\n \n\n### Neural correlates of tracking social preference in adolescents \n  \n#### The FFA simultaneously tracks peers high and low in social preference \n  \nOur first goal was to examine which neural regions similarly track peers high and low in social status. We found that the FFA was activated while adolescents tracked both peers high and low in social preference. Our results, along with previous evidence, bolsters the emerging perspective that high-order social knowledge may have a downstream regulation on visuoperceptual processes by showing that both highly likable and unlikable peers are represented by the FFA. A substantial body of neuroimaging studies reveals that the FFA is highly specialized in object- and face-perception expertise ( ;  ) and in the perception of social categories, particularly in distinguishing salient faces from non-salient faces ( ). Most neuroimaging studies to date have treated the FFA as a single area; however, there is a growing recognition that the FFA contains two functionally distinct regions\u2014FFA1 and FFA2 ( ;  ). The FFA1, which is the posterior part of the fusiform gyrus, is linked to featural analysis of faces (e.g.  ;  ) and early perceptual learning about faces (e.g.  ). In contrast, FFA2, the anterior part of the FFA, is associated with recognition accuracy of face identity and detecting the social salience of percepts (e.g.  ;  ;  ). We found that activation in the FFA1 and FFA2 were both sensitive to social rank, which may suggest that information about social rank is relevant to both the early perception of faces as well as the social evaluation of those faces, more generally. Together, these findings may explain why inferring the social attributes of faces is an early (within hundreds of milliseconds) and primary feature of face perception ( ,  ). \n\nTo date, most studies in the extant literature have focused on how and why individuals with more social value receive more selective attention compared to individuals with less social value (e.g.  ;  ). Relatively less attention has been paid to how individuals perceive and process low-status peers and how high- and low-status peers may be represented in the brain. Indeed, significant activation in the early visuoperceptual system in response to both high- and low-status peers might be developmentally adaptive. Our findings suggest that the visuoperceptual regions of adolescents\u2019 brains may represent socially salient input along a single psychological dimension, which may in turn allow youths to allocate attentional resources to rapidly evaluate and identify socially desirable and undesirable members within their social networks. This information about group members, in turn, potentially guides adolescents\u2019 subsequent social behaviors and interactions with their peers. For example, peers high in social preference may be rewarding to adolescents because these peers receive more collective attention from others; approaching and bonding with this socially valued group may provide avenues to maintain or further improve one\u2019s status in a network ( ). In contrast, low social preference (i.e.\u00a0being disliked) is often associated with social isolation and relational aggression ( ;  ;  ). Adolescents may actively seek to avoid these individuals, as bonding with this group may lower one\u2019s own peer status or result in peer victimization. Thus, it may be optimal in adolescence to allocate attentional resources to identifying both socially rewarding and threatening members of one\u2019s peer group. Our finding suggests that the FFA, a critical region for face perception and social categorization, plays a substantial role in representing adolescents\u2019 peer-based social hierarchies which may subserve their navigation in their real social world. \n\n\n#### The DLPFC differentially tracks high and low social preference peers \n  \nOur second goal was to examine neural regions which uniquely track peers high in social preference and low in social preference. We found that the DLPFC was differentially involved in tracking peers who were high and low in social preferences, such that brain activation increased for high social preference peers but decreased for low social preference peers. The DLPFC is involved in goal-directed attentional control in humans ( ), and a substantial body of neuroimaging work links the DLPFC to the representation of social hierarchies and social-hierarchy-dependent behaviors in non-human primates and humans. For example, in rhesus macaques, the DLPFC underlies increased attention to hierarchically superior   vs   inferior conspecifics (for review,  ). In humans, the DLPFC is broadly implicated in interpersonal judgment ( ), social moral judgment ( ) and perceiving socially valued members ( ). For instance, neuroimaging studies found increased DLPFC activation during passive observation of socially valued individuals relative to socially unvalued individuals ( ;  ), suggesting its essential role in the representation of social hierarchy. Recent neuroimaging work has proposed that the DLPFC may also serve as a central mediator in behavioral regulation and social hierarchy processing (for review,  ;  ). Indeed, empirical evidence shows that DLPFC activation is positively associated with one\u2019s subjective levels of social norm compliance ( ), and related to one\u2019s behaviors and attitudes associated with the affirmation of social hierarchies among group members ( ). Our finding shows that the DLPFC differentially tracks high and low social preference peers, suggesting that the DLPFC may be specialized in tracking self-relevant social hierarchy information from visual inputs and may underlie the psychological responses to peers with higher and lower social rank. Given that social behaviors often occur in tandem with peer status inferences ( ) and adolescents are more susceptible to the influence of high-status peers than the influence of low-status peers (e.g.  ;  ), differential neural tracking in the DLPFC to high peer status and low peer status may serve as a susceptibility marker to peer influence. \n\n\n#### Two neuropsychological processes for tracking social preference in adolescents \n  \nThe current results suggest that two parallel processes may help adolescents track their peer-based social hierarchies in terms of social preference: (i) neural sensitivity that tracks   both   high and low social preference peers within the core face processing system (i.e.\u00a0the FFA) may allow youth to represent their emerging peer-based social hierarchies; (ii) neural sensitivity that   differentially   tracks peers high and low in social preference within regions involved in goal-directed attention and behavioral regulation (i.e. DLPFC) may allow youth to represent high- and low-status peers differently. This differential neural tracking of peers high and low in social preference may help adolescents identify those peers who they deem behaviorally relevant. These neural processes may present important pathways via which adolescents navigate their social networks across peer contexts. First, insofar as peer-based social hierarchies provide a developmental context for adolescents to understand social relationships and practice cooperation, compromise and competition with peers who vary in peer status ( ); accurate representation of social hierarchies via the FFA may set a critical stage for adolescents\u2019 social behaviors towards both socially valued and unvalued peers. Second, since social hierarchies have a profound impact on organizing social groups, differential neurobiological sensitivity to high and low social preference peers in the DLPFC may help explain teenagers\u2019 social behaviors, particularly in peer influence contexts. In humans, high-status members facilitate low-status members\u2019 social learning processes and maximize low-status members\u2019 motivation ( ;  ). Moreover, studies suggest that adolescents more strongly conform to high-status peers\u2019 than low-status peers\u2019 behaviors, regardless of whether those behaviors are prosocial ( ) or risky ( ;  ). These behavioral changes in peer contexts often occur in tandem with peer status inference and social comparison. Our finding here may thus shed light on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying peer influence in adolescents\u2014differential neural sensitivity in the DLPFC to high- and low-status peers. Together, we identify two potential neuropsychological processes that allow youths to represent their emerging social hierarchies and keep track of peer status, which provide insight into how teens flexibly and sufficiently navigate their real-world social networks. \n\n\n\n### Neural correlates of tracking popularity in adolescents \n  \nIn the current study, we also examined how adolescents\u2019 brains track another significant sociometric dimension\u2014popularity. Interestingly, we did not find any overlap in regions that track both high and low popularity. Moreover, no regions significantly tracked adolescents high in perceived popularity. In contrast, we found that peers who were rated as low in popularity (i.e. unpopular) were uniquely represented at the neural level. In particular, we found that the IPL was involved in tracking more unpopular peers in adolescents\u2019 social networks. The IPL is a key neural substrate for a variety of psychological processes, including fundamental visuospatial attention, language processing and social cognition that governs human social interactions (for review,  ). Importantly, empirical work suggests that the IPL hierarchically represents social information within a continuum. For instance, neuroimaging studies have demonstrated a graded response in IPL to emotion recognition behaviors representing intense fear   vs   mild fear   vs   neutral facial recognition behaviors ( ). IPL also responds while human subjects represent the hierarchical rank of group members during passively viewing of facial or body images ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Along with these neuroimaging findings, our study suggests that the IPL may also hierarchically represent peer status in adolescents. Nevertheless, the IPL only appears to track the hierarchical status information amongst unpopular peers in adolescence; no significant results were found in the popular peer condition. \n\nInterestingly, we found that the TPJ, insula and MCC were more significantly active as unpopularity decreased in the low-popular peer condition. In other words, neural responses within these regions were stronger to those mildly unpopular peers than extremely unpopular peers in adolescents. A substantial body of work links TPJ to the understanding of others\u2019 thoughts and feelings in social contexts ( ) and inferring social member\u2019s status within a network ( ), while the insula and MCC are involved in representing salient and affectively potent stimuli ( ) and are activated during the observation of and empathy for others\u2019 experiences (e.g. social exclusion;  ). Indeed, recent neuroimaging work shows that the co-activation between these regions involved in mentalizing and empathy predicts adolescents\u2019 behavioral change in peer contexts ( ), consistent with these brain regions\u2019 vital role in navigating the social world. It is intriguing that these brain regions become less engaged the more unpopular the target is. Future studies including measures assessing additional peer characteristics and adolescents\u2019 subjective feelings are needed to detect the psychological meanings of this neural process in adolescents. \n\nSurprisingly, we did not find any brain region that linearly tracks increases in popularity amongst the most popular peers in adolescence. These null findings reflect two possibilities. One potential explanation is that highly popular peers may not be socially salient and valued by adolescents. However, this is unlikely to be true, as a substantial body of empirical work has suggested that popular peers play a significant role in behavioral conformity among teens (for review,  ). Furthermore, adolescents are visuoperceptually sensitive to highly popular peers ( ). Alternatively, our null finding may suggest that past a certain threshold of popularity, adolescents do not distinguish neurally amongst highly popular peers within their social networks. That is, all popular peers may elicit similar activation, regardless of within-group variation in popularity levels. \n\n\n\n## Limitations and future directions \n  \nThe current study uses novel methods to investigate how neural processes during adolescence allow youths to keep track of the peer status in their social networks. Using sociometric nomination techniques in which all teens in a school nominated their high and low social preference and popularity peers, paired with neuroimaging allowed us to delineate how the adolescent brain is functionally organized to map their emerging social hierarchies. Nonetheless, this study has limitations. First, we used images of peers who were most liked and least liked, as well as most popular and least popular, but did not include images of average social status peers in our study. We did so because faces of high and low social status peers are important social cues that humans preferentially pay more attention to and because they are important social agents that have profound impacts on adolescent behaviors ( , ;  ). Nonetheless, future investigations including a broader range of peer status will help us better understand how the developing brain fully represents social hierarchies during adolescence. For instance, it would be interesting to understand whether peer status is represented in a graded fashion in the adolescent brain or whether it is represented in a more categorical fashion (e.g. whereby average teens are more similar to low status teens than high status teens). \n\nA second limitation of the present study is that sociometric nominations and yearbook images were necessarily from the prior year of data collection. We did so because of the time it took to process the massive sociometric data and the availability of photo images before the scan session. Thus, it is possible that the peer statuses of nominated teens might have changed across the year leading up to our neuroimaging session. However, both prior research and our study show that peer status is highly stable across years (i.e.\u00a0correlation range from 0.7 to 0.9) during adolescence ( ; see  ), suggesting this likely is not a major confound. Nonetheless, it would be interesting to examine the neural representation of social hierarchy in a longitudinal fashion to examine how it might shift with shifts in social hierarchies. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nPeers gain increased salience during adolescence and youths become hyper-attuned to their emerging social hierarchies in peer contexts during this time ( ), yet no work to date has examined how youths keep track of peer status and represent their emerging peer-based social hierarchies. This work, to our knowledge, is the first study to investigate adolescents\u2019 neural tracking of peer status by integrating neuroimaging with sociometric nomination techniques. We revealed different neuropsychological processes which may be involved in encoding the complex social hierarchy among adolescents: (i) the early visual system for face perception and social categorization\u2014the fusiform face area\u2014similarly represents both high and low social preference peers (i.e.\u00a0most liked and least liked peers), which may be socially and developmentally adaptive for teens\u2019 social navigation; (ii) the DLPFC is differentially engaged in tracking high and low social preference peers in adolescents, such that adolescents exhibited increased activation to peers high in social preference while decreased activation to peers low in social preference in the DLPFC; (iii) the IPL, TPJ, MCC and insula automatically tracks the popularity of peers, but only to those lowest in popularity, with no regions tracking high popular peers. These findings make a novel and significant contribution to the study of adolescent brain development, social development, peer relationship and research on peer influences. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10656574, "text_md5": "7b8b417bce06633a8dd66e114b6ff26f", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 180], "journal": [181, 205], "publication_year": [207, 211], "title": [222, 302], "keywords": [316, 409], "abstract": [422, 1806], "body": [1815, 58561]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 37978845, "doi": "10.1093/scan/nsad064", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10656574", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10656574"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10656574\">10656574</a>", "list_title": "PMC10656574  Neural tracking of\u00a0social hierarchies in\u00a0adolescents\u2019 real-world social networks"}

We modeled the relationships between CRF, PA, and brain functional integrity using multivariate partial least squares analysis. As an index of functional brain integrity we used spontaneous moment-to-moment variability in the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal (SD ), known to be associated with better cognitive functioning in aging. We found that older adults who engaged more in LI-PA and MV-PA had greater SD  in brain regions that play a role in integrating segregated functional domains in the brain and benefit from greater CRF or PA, such as precuneus, hippocampus, medial and lateral prefrontal, and temporal cortices. Our results suggest that engaging in higher intensity PA may have protective effects on neural processing in aging. Finally, we demonstrated that older adults with greater overall WM microstructure were those showing more LI-PA and MV-PA and greater SD . We conclude that SD  is a promising correlate of functional brain health in aging. Future analyses will evaluate whether SD  is modifiable with interventions aimed to increase PA and CRF in older adults. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nHigher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and physical activity (PA) in old age is associated with greater brain structural and functional integrity, and higher cognitive functioning [ \u2013 ]. In this study we extend our understanding of the different and overlapping roles of CRF and PA in brain resting state function in healthy but low-active older adults. \n\nThere are three main challenges in understanding how physical health and lifestyle PA relate to brain function in older adults. First, it is not known how non-exercise lifestyle activities, such sedentariness (prolonged and uninterrupted periods of sitting, such as watching TV) or light PA (LI-PA; housework, gardening, relaxed walking) relate to brain function, although they account for the majority of daily waking time. This is because lower intensity PA, in contrast to exercise-related moderate-to-vigorous PA (MV-PA, e.g. jogging, walking stairs, biking), is not well captured by self-reports [ ]. This is important, as sedentariness and MV-PA are associated with different physiological mechanisms and may differentially affect brain health. For example, general sedentariness may negate or weaken the benefits of sporadic MV-PA: it is possible to be an \u201cactive couch potato\u201d who has normal CRF due to bouts of exercise, but is not immune to glucose and fat metabolism risk caused by prolonged sitting [ \u2013 ]. Second, it is not known how the effects of CRF and PA differ or overlap with respect to brain function. CRF, measured as maximal oxygen consumption during maximal physical effort, is a sum of various factors, such as pulmonary diffusion capacity, cardiac output, erythrocyte levels, muscle capillary density and respiration rate [ \u2013 ], many of which are genetically determined, at least in part [ ]. Therefore, although CRF and PA tend to be related, they may not be equivalent in their relationships to brain health. Indeed, our recent work indicates that PA is more predictive of white matter (WM) microstructure than CRF, and different levels of PA intensity relate to different aspects of WM health. Specifically, less time spent sitting was related to microstructure of WM near the hippocampus, more LI-PA was related to temporal lobe microstructure, while older adults spending more time in MV-PA had lower volume of WM lesions [ ]. Still, these objective measures of time spent in different intensities of PA have not yet been related to functional brain health in aging. To address these two challenges, we objectively measured PA with an accelerometer, which was worn for 7 consecutive days during all waking hours, in addition to CRF. \n\nThe third challenge is measuring brain function and the interpretation of the fitness- and PA-brain function relationships. For example, depending on brain region and task, greater CRF is associated with either increased or decreased change in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal, a proxy for neural activity [ \u2013 ]. As a result, it is unclear whether high or low amplitudes of BOLD signal reflect optimal functional brain health, and how this association varies regionally throughout the brain. Similarly, a moderate intensity walking intervention was related to increased functional connectivity within the default mode network [ ], while the association between CRF and functional connectivity in middle-aged adults was both positive and negative, depending on whether local or long-distance connections were considered [ ]. To overcome the challenges in interpretation of conventional positive/negative task-related changes in BOLD signal or different scales of functional synchrony between distinct brain regions, here we employed a more general measure of neural function: moment-to-moment variability in the BOLD signal during spontaneous brain activity. \n\nMoment-to-moment variability in the BOLD signal (SD ) is known to reflect the dynamic range of neural processing, such as the modulation of functional networks and is suggested to be a promising tool in mapping neural correlates of cognitive abilities in aging [ , ]. Specifically, lower SD  in certain brain regions is associated with older age, slower, and less consistent performance on a perceptual matching task [ ], as well as lower performance on memory and reasoning tasks [ ]. These findings suggest there is some optimal range of SD  that may be decreasing with age in certain brain regions, and that older adults differ in their deviation below this optimum, which is associated with individual differences in cognitive performance. \n\nIn this study, we sought to determine how the level of physical fitness (measured as CRF) and PA (measured via accelerometer) are related to functional brain health measured as SD . To this end, we collected resting functional magnetic resonance BOLD data from 100 healthy older participants (60\u201380 years). We modeled the relations between whole-brain voxel-wise SD , CRF, and PA (mean daily sedentary time, time spent in LI-PA, and MV-PA) within a multivariate partial least squares framework [ ]. Given that: 1) advancing age is associated with decreasing SD  and 2) greater CRF, PA, and lower sedentariness are associated with better cognitive and brain health outcomes in older adults, we predicted that greater SD  in certain regions would reflect greater brain health and therefore positively correlate with CRF and PA, and negatively with sedentariness. Although the relevance of SD  in the brain for physical fitness is not yet known, we hypothesized that some of the regions where conventional measures of structural and functional brain integrity have been previously associated with greater CRF (e.g. hippocampus, temporal lobe, core regions of the default mode network (precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex), fronto-parietal regions of the central executive network, anterior cingulate, insula, and thalamus) would show this CRF/PA\u2014SD  relationship [ \u2013 , \u2013 ]. \n\nIn sum, we have shown previously that more active and less sedentary older people have greater WM microstructural integrity and lower volume of WM lesions [ ], that WM microstructure is positively related to behaviorally relevant SD  [ ], and that overall WM microstructure provides a scaffold for neural processing in the grey matter (GM) [ ]. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that WM microstructural integrity should be positively associated with CRF/PA-related SD . To this end, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to infer about WM microstructure by quantifying the magnitude and directionality of diffusion of water within a tissue. We used fractional anisotropy (FA) averaged over all major WM tracts as a summary measure of fiber density, coherence, and myelination degree [ \u2013 ]. \n\nWe found that older adults who spend more time daily on LI-PA and MV-PA had greater SD  in multiple brain regions, and this relationship was positively associated with WM microstructure. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA University of Illinois Institutional Review Board approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study was performed in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Participants received financial reimbursement. \n\nWe collected MRI, PA and CRF data from 150 community-dwelling healthy older adults (51 males). The sample contained more females because fewer older males responded to recruitment materials and met the following inclusion criteria: (1) were between the ages of 60 and 80 years old; (2) were free from psychiatric and neurological illness and had no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack; (3) scored \u2265 23 on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE [ ]) and >21 on a Modified Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status (TICS-M [ ]) questionnaire; (4) scored < 10 on the geriatric depression scale (GDS-15 [ ]);, (5) scored \u2265 75% right-handedness on the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ ];, (6) demonstrated normal or corrected-to-normal vision of at least 20/40 and no color blindness;, (7) were cleared for suitability in the MRI environment, that is, no metallic implants that could interfere with the magnetic field or cause injury, no claustrophobia, and no history of head trauma. The participants were a pre-intervention cross-sectional subsample from an on-going randomized controlled exercise trial (\u201cInfluence of Fitness on Brain and Cognition II\u201d at ClinicalTrials.gov, clinical study identifier NCT01472744). We further excluded participants with MMSE < 27 to limit the analyses to cognitively healthy older adults and exclude those with possible mild cognitive impairment. This resulted in a sample of 133 participants (45 male). Out of 133, 100 participants (34 males) had good quality MRI data available (see section on resting state and MPRAGE) and only these datasets were considered for further analyses (age range 60\u201378, M  = 65.4 \u00b1 4.4 years, years of education 12\u201326, M  = 16.8 \u00b1 3.5 years). \n\n\n### Physical activity assessment \n  \nParticipants were instructed to wear the GT3X ActiGraph accelerometer (ActiGraph; Pensacola, Florida) for 7 consecutive days on an elastic belt on the left (non-dominant) hip during all waking hours, except for when bathing or swimming. The participants completed a daily log to record the time that the accelerometer was worn, and this log was used to verify the accelerometer data for processing with the ActiLife v5.6.0 software. For the purposes of this study, a valid day of data consisted of at least 10 hours of valid wear-time, with a valid hour defined as no more than 30 consecutive minutes of zero counts with one minute sampling epochs. Only data for individuals with a minimum of 3 valid days of wear time were included in analyses [ ]. The 100 participants had on average 6.8 \u00b1 0.8 valid days of measurement (range 4\u20138), resulting in 95% of the sample having 6 or more valid days required to reliably measure sedentary behavior [ ]. \n\nEach valid measurement epoch (minute) was classified into sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity based on displacement magnitude and frequency. We used activity intensity cut-off ranges appropriate for older adults [ ] using MeterPlus v4.2 software (Santech, Inc.; San Diego, CA). Sedentary behavior was defined as <100, light activity as 100\u20131951, moderate activity as 1952\u20135723, and vigorous activity as > 5724 counts/minute [ ]. The total minutes of each intensity, divided by total valid days, yielded average time (in hours or minutes) spent daily in a specific physical activity intensity ( ). Only 15 out of 100 participants showed any vigorous activity during the measurement week. We therefore summed moderate and vigorous activity to obtain a \u201cmoderate-to-vigorous activity\u201d (MV-PA) variable [ ]. Observed MV-PA was positively skewed and we performed a natural log-transformation of this variable for further analyses. \n   Descriptive statistics and correlations with age.        \nThe sample was defined as low-active and low-fit but generally healthy and living independently, because the participants had to be eligible for the subsequent exercise intervention study (capable of performing exercise, i.e. no physical disability that prohibits mobility) and were expected to benefit from such lifestyle change. To define our sample we used both the self-reports at study entry and verified them with the subsequent objective accelerometry data. Eighty participants at study entry reported not to have participated in regular PA (maximum of two moderate bouts of PA/week) in the past six months. The remaining 20 reported engaging in some exercise upon recruitment. However, the subsequent accelerometer data analysis revealed that only 32 of the total sample (17 from the 80 self-reported low-active individuals and 15 of the 20 more active participants) met the minimum recommendations for PA (>150 min of moderate PA per week; [ ]). This means that roughly \u00bc of participants in each subgroup (active or not active by self-report) incorrectly assessed their PA levels. Clearly, this discrepancy between self-reports and accelerometer data highlights the necessity of objective assessment of PA for accurate sample description when studying the relationships between brain health and PA in older adults. Importantly, the accelerometer data reflects all PA within the 7-day period, while the PA recommendations refer to leisure time or planned exercise PA, in addition to the lifestyle-related PA. Therefore, accelerometer estimates of PA include both lifestyle activities (shopping, climbing stairs) and leisure exercise (jogging, bike trips). As follows, even less than 32 participants met the actual PA recommendations and, therefore, we defined our sample as low-fit and low-active. \n\n\n### Cardiorespiratory fitness assessment \n  \nAll participants obtained physician's approval to engage in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) testing. CRF was defined as peak oxygen consumption [ml/kg/min], measured with indirect calorimetry during a modified Balke graded maximal exercise test on a motor-driven treadmill test. Oxygen consumption (VO ) was calculated from expired air sampled at 30-s intervals until peak VO  was reached or the test was terminated due to volitional exhaustion and/or symptom limitation. CRF was defined as the highest recorded VO  value (VO max) after two of three criteria were met: (1) a plateau in VO  after increase in workload; (2) a respiratory exchange ratio >1.10; and (3) a maximal heart rate within 10bpm of their age-predicted maximum. Our subjects represented a broad range of CRF values that were normally distributed and fell within the 90% peak VO max percentile (very poor to good,  ) according to gender- and age-specific norms (ACSM's Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription,  ). As men and women differ in VO max due to body composition, lung size etc., we transformed VO max values into z-scores within each gender group to remove variance related to sex. \n\n\n### MRI acquisition \n  \nWe acquired all images during a single session on a 3T Siemens Tim Trio system with 45 mT/m gradients and 200 T/m/sec slew rates (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). T2*-weighted resting state images were acquired with fast echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast (6min, TR = 2s, TE = 25ms, flip angle = 80 degrees, 3.4 x 3.4 mm  in-plane resolution, 35 4mm-thick slices acquired in ascending order, Grappa acceleration factor = 2, 64 \u00d7 64 matrix), while the participants were asked to lie still with eyes closed. Additionally, gradient field maps were acquired to account for geometric distortions caused by magnetic field inhomogeneity [ ]. The gradient field map was collected as 35, 4mm-thick slices, 3.4 x 3.4 mm  in-plane resolution, TR = 700ms, TE = 10ms, and flip angle = 35 degrees. DTI images were acquired with a twice-refocused spin echo single-shot Echo Planar Imaging sequence [ ] to minimize eddy current-induced image distortions. The protocol consisted of a set of 30 non-collinear diffusion-weighted acquisitions with b-value = 1000s/mm  and two T2-weighted b-value = 0 s/mm  acquisitions, repeated two times (TR/TE = 5500/98 ms, 128 x 128 matrix, 1.7x1.7 mm  in-plane resolution, FA = 90, GRAPPA acceleration factor 2, and bandwidth of 1698 Hz/Px, comprising 40 3-mm-thick slices). Resting state, fieldmap, and diffusion images were obtained parallel to the anterior-posterior commissure plane with no interslice gap. \n\nHigh-resolution structural MR scans were acquired using a 3D MPRAGE T1-weighted sequence (TR = 1900 ms; TE = 2.32 ms; TI: 900 ms; flip angle = 9\u00b0; matrix = 256 \u00d7 256; FOV = 230mm; 192 slices; resolution = 0.9 \u00d7 0.9 \u00d7 0.9 mm; GRAPPA acceleration factor 2) and used as an intermediate step in registration of functional images to standard MNI space. \n\n\n### BOLD variability (SD ) calculation \n  \nData processing was carried out using FSL v5.0.1 (FMRIB's Software Library,  ; Smith et al. 2004). The preprocessing included filtering out frequencies <0.008Hz, slice timing correction, rigid body motion correction using MCFLIRT [ ], and removal of non-brain tissue with the Brain Extraction Tool [ ]. Data were screened for motion and all participants moved within a voxel dimension (< 4mm). Functional images of each participant were aligned to the standard stereotaxic space of the MNI 152 T1 2mm  template supplied in FSL in a three-step procedure. To improve the registration between the participant\u2019s functional and anatomical images we utilized the gradient field map data. First, the gradient field map was unwrapped via PRELUDE [ ], then geometric distortions in the EPI-related images due to local magnetic inhomogeneity differences were compensated for with the use of gradient field map data via FUGUE within FSL [ ]. Ten out of 100 participants had missing field map images. Second, each participant\u2019s low-resolution functional images were aligned with their high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images using the Boundary-Based Registration in FSL [ ]. Third, the anatomical images were aligned to MNI 152T1 2mm  template using 12 degrees of freedom affine linear registration [ ]. \n\nNext, we used Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components (MELODIC v3.10) tool in FSL [ ] to decompose the 4D fMRI time series into spatial and temporal components using independent component analysis (ICA). AZB together with Chanheng He and CNW identified artifact components for each subject using the criteria outlined in [ ] based on the spatial pattern, time course, and power spectrum properties that were characteristic of physiological noise, motion, and scanner-related artifacts. We note here that motion timecourses were viewed simultaneously with the components\u2019 timecourses, which made it straightforward to classify motion components as noise. The artifactual components were regressed out from the time series yielding the post-ICA \u2018cleaned\u2019 data. These post-ICA functional data were further low-pass filtered to restrict the frequencies in our data to   f   < .1 Hz [ ]. Next, we extracted the mean time series from two regions (deep temporal WM and bilateral lateral ventricles) in the post-ICA filtered data. The goal of including these two nuisance regressors was to remove residual cardiorespiratory physiological noise that would be captured by signal changes in the WM and ventricles [ \u2013 ] and was not removed by the ICA cleanup. The two nuisance regressors (timeseries from WM and ventricles) were regressed out using the general linear model with FEAT 6.00 (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool;  ). Finally, we calculated the standard deviation (SD ) across the whole timeseries for each voxel and smoothed the images with 6mm Gaussian kernel. We smooth the data as the last step to preserve the original localization of the signal throughout all the preprocessing steps. The resulting SD  maps were upsampled to MNI space using registration steps described above. To restrict all multivariate analyses to the GM, we masked the SD  maps with the GM tissue prior provided in FSL, thresholded at probability > 0.37, as described earlier in [ ]. The SD  maps of the 100 participants are deposited at  . \n\n\n### PLS multivariate analysis of relations among SD , PA and CRF \n  \nThe behavioral PLS analysis [ , ] began with a correlation matrix (CORR) between our variables of interest (PA and CRF) and each voxel\u2019s signal (SD ); correlations were calculated across subjects. Then, this CORR matrix was decomposed via singular value decomposition (SVD): SVD  =   USV\u2019  . This decomposition produces a left singular vector of behavioral weights (  U  ), a right singular vector of SD  weights (  V  ), and a diagonal matrix of singular values (  S  ). In other words, this analysis produces orthogonal latent variables (LVs) that optimally represent relations between PA and CRF measures and SD  in GM voxels. Each LV contains a spatial pattern depicting the brain regions where the SD  shows the strongest relation to PA and CRF. Each brain weight (in   V  ) is proportional to the correlation between PA and CRF with SD . To obtain a summary measure of each participant\u2019s expression of a particular LV pattern, we calculated within-person \u201cbrain scores\u201d by multiplying each voxel (  i  )\u2019s weight (  V)   from the particular LV (  j  ) produced from the SVD in equation (1) by the SD  value in that voxel for person (  k  ), and summing over all (  n  ) brain voxels:  . Thus, in a single measure, a brain score indicates the degree to which a subject expresses the multivariate spatial pattern captured by the particular LV. Significance of detected relations between multivariate spatial patterns of SD , PA and CRF was assessed using 1000 permutation tests of the singular value corresponding to each LV. A subsequent bootstrapping procedure revealed the robustness of voxel saliences across 1000 bootstrapped resamples of our data [ ]. By dividing each voxel\u2019s mean salience by its bootstrapped standard error, we obtained \u201cbootstrap ratios\u201d as normalized estimates of robustness. We thresholded bootstrap ratios at a value of \u2265 3.00, which approximates a 99% confidence interval and corresponds to p < .001. \n\n\n### DTI analysis \n  \nVisual checks were performed on every volume of the raw data of every participant by AZB. Seventy-four participants had good quality DTI data. In one dataset, one volume with the corresponding b-vectors and b-values was deleted from the dataset before processing due to an artifact. Next, DTI data were processed using the FSL Diffusion Toolbox v.3.0 (FDT:  ) in a standard multistep procedure, including: (a) motion and eddy current correction of the images and corresponding b-vectors; (b) removal of the skull and non-brain tissue using the Brain Extraction Tool [ ]; and (c) voxel-by-voxel calculation of the diffusion tensors. Using the diffusion tensor information, FA maps were computed using DTIFit within the FDT. All motion- and eddy-current outputs, as well as FA images were visually inspected. \n\nWe used TBSS [ , ], a toolbox within FSL v5.0.1, to create a representation of main WM tracts common to all subjects (WM \u201cskeleton\u201d). This included: (a) nonlinear alignment of each participant\u2019s FA volume to the 1 x 1 x 1 mm  standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI152) space via the FMRIB58_FA template using the FMRIB\u2019s Nonlinear Registration Tool (FNIRT, [ ];  ); (b) calculation of the mean of all aligned FA images; (c) creation of the WM \u201cskeleton\u201d by perpendicular non-maximum-suppression of the mean FA image and setting the FA threshold to 0.25; and (d) perpendicular projection of the highest FA value (local center of the tract) onto the skeleton, separately for each subject. The outputs of all the above processing steps were carefully inspected by AZB. To obtain a global FA measure, we averaged FA over the whole skeleton for each participant. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nAll statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (v.16, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). We used multiple step-wise hierarchical linear regressions (with chronological age and gender) to investigate the relationships between brain scores expressing the CRF/PA\u2014SD  relationship and motion parameters. The brain scores of the PLS model relating SD  to PA and CRF were above 2.5 SD for two participants, and were Winsorized before regression analyses and creating scatterplots. The relative motion was ln-transformed for correlations as it was positively skewed. \n\nThe demographic data, FA, CRF and PA values, and brain scores are available in ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Correlations between CRF, PA, and SD  (CRF/PA\u2014SD  model) \n  \nTo identify multivariate patterns of relations between CRF, the three PA measures, and SD  in the entire GM we performed behavioral PLS analysis. We refer to it as the CRF/PA\u2014SD  model. The behavioral PLS analysis yields orthogonal latent variables (LVs) that optimally represent relations of SD  in GM voxels with CRF and number of hours spent on PA at three intensities. The analysis yielded one significant LV (permuted p = 0.040, 52.63% cross-block covariance explained by this LV), suggesting that more LI-PA and MV-PA was related to greater SD  in multiple GM regions ( ). CRF and sedentary time did not significantly contribute to the model. Peak voxels\u2019 location and bootstrap ratios for the CRF/PA\u2014SD  model are reported in  . \n   Multivariate relationships between CRF, PA, and SD  (the CRF/PA\u2014SD  model).  \n A:   PLS spatial pattern of the CRF/PA\u2014SD  model. Red-yellow regions indicate greater SD  with greater LI-PA and MV-PA. Significant regions: bootstrap ratio \u22653.00. Abbreviations as in  .   B:   Correlation magnitudes (Pearson r) between CRF, sedentary time, LI-PA, MV-PA, and SD  during rest (permuted p<0.001, error bars represent bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals). CRF and sedentary time did not contribute to the LV as their error bars cross zero. \n     Significant clusters representing the CRF/PA\u2014SD  model from  .        \n\n### CRF/PA\u2014SD  model: relationship to structural brain connectivity \n  \nIn our previous studies we showed that behaviorally relevant SD  is related to whole-brain WM microstructure in older adults [ ] and that greater PA was positively associated with WM microstructure [ ]. Therefore, after showing that greater LI-PA and MV-PA is beneficial for brain function (i.e. related to greater SD ), we tested the hypothesis that the CRF/PA- related brain pattern of SD  would be associated with WM microstructure. We expected that participants who engage in more LI-PA and MV-PA should show an advantage in both brain structure and function, and therefore greater WM microstructure should be related to greater \u201cbrain scores\u201d from the CRF/PA\u2014SD  model. \u201cBrain score\u201d is a summary measure of each participant\u2019s expression of the significant LV pattern from  . Thus, a person with a higher brain score showed higher LI-PA and MV-PA and greater SD  in the voxels depicted in  . As there was a negative association between FA and age, and brain scores of CRF/PA\u2014SD  model and age (r = -.23 p = .021, n = 100), we performed a hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis to investigate age-independent links between the brains scores and WM microstructure. The brain scores were the dependent variable, age was the first independent variable and global FA was the second independent variable. We found that higher FA accounted for a significant amount of variance in the CRF/PA\u2014SD  association, in addition to variance related to age (R  change  = 0.034, F change  = 2.41, df = 69/1, p-value = .125; R  change  = 0.121. F change  = 9.753, df = 68/1, p-value = .003). We note that there was a trend toward a positive relationship between MV-PA and FA (r = .20 p = .101, n = 71), while CRF, sedentary time, and LI-PA were not associated with global FA. \n\n\n### Exploring the effects of in-scanner motion on CRF/PA\u2014SD  associations \n  \nWe found that people who engage more in LI-PA and MV-PA show greater SD  (CRF/PA\u2014SD  model,  ). If our findings were driven by individual differences in motion then this would predict that more active people moved more in the scanner. This is unlikely but we tested this to ensure that our results were not confounded by motion. We performed three analyses: 1) We tested the in-scanner motion\u2014SD  relationship directly in a behavioral PLS model with motion parameters from the resting state acquisition as the behavioral variable; 2) We related CRF and PA measures to in-scanner motion; 3) We correlated the brain scores from the CRF/PA\u2014SD  model with motion parameters. \n\nThe relative motion (volume-to-volume displacement of subject\u2019s head) should have the most influence on moment-to-moment variability in the BOLD signal during the resting state acquisition. Therefore, we used the mean relative motion quantified by the motion correction algorithm during preprocessing as the measure of the average volume-to-volume displacement of subject\u2019s head during the scan. If motion during scanning contributed to the CRF/PA\u2014SD  relationship, we expected: 1) a significant positive relationship between mean relative motion and SD ; 2) a significant positive relationship between mean relative motion and PA; and 3) a significant positive relationship between mean relative motion and the brain scores from the CRF/PA\u2014SD  model. \n\nOur results did not support the possibility that in-scanner motion contributes to the SD  and the CRF/PA\u2014SD  associations. First, the PLS behavioral analysis relating relative motion to SD  relationship did not yield a significant LV (p = .375), suggesting that there was no relationship between moment-to-moment subjects\u2019 motion in the scanner and the moment-to-moment variability in the BOLD signal. Second, we found that participants with higher CRF, PA, and less time spent in sedentary behavior showed not more, but less relative motion during the resting state scan (CRF: r = -.38, p < .001, n = 100; sedentary time: r = .23, p = .022, n = 100; MV-PA: r = -.27, p = .008, n = 100). LI-PA was not related to relative motion. Third, we found that relative motion was not related to the brain scores representing the CRF/PA\u2014SD  model (r = .005, p = .957, n = 100). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe used a whole-brain, multivariate approach to investigate the associations of objective indices of physical fitness and activity (CRF and PA) with brain functional resting state properties (moment-to-moment variability in the BOLD signal) in healthy older adults. This allowed us to demonstrate that older adults who engage in more PA (LI-PA and\u2014to a greater extent\u2014MV-PA) have greater SD  in multiple regions, while CRF and sedentary behavior did not significantly contribute to variance in SD . Next, the inter-individual differences in the PA\u2014SD  relationships were associated with global WM microstructure, above and beyond the effects of chronological age. Moreover, we demonstrated that the in-scanner motion did not drive the association of PA with SD . Here we discuss the implications of this first demonstration of an association between objectively measured PA, brain function, and structure in an older population. \n\n### SD  as a candidate functional correlate of brain health \n  \nIn the current study, we showed that older, low-active adults who engage regularly in more LI-PA and MV-PA have greater variability in the spontaneous low-frequency BOLD signal. Given that previous evidence has shown that: 1) greater SD  in older age relates to better cognitive functioning; 2) the brain\u2019s network organization may benefit from greater SD  in specific regions; and that 3) regions showing the PA\u2014SD  relationship overlap with regions where some conventional neural functional measures are related with CRF and PA, we interpret our findings to suggest that a positive relationship between SD  and PA reflects better functional brain health. \n\nFirst, recent studies exploring the significance of SD  for cognitive performance in aging demonstrated that older adults show lower SD  than young adults, and that greater SD  in multiple GM regions is related to faster and more consistent performance on a perceptual matching task [ ], and better fluid abilities and memory in older adults [ ]. These previous findings suggest that preserving optimal (i.e. higher) levels of SD  in specific brain regions in advanced age is beneficial for cognitive functioning. Here we show that SD  may serve as one of the correlates of functional brain health related to physical activity and health. \n\nSecond, many of the brain regions showing the PA- SD  relationship play an important role in brain network organization. Therefore, our results support the notion that the brain network function should benefit from their greater SD  [ ], assuming it represents greater dynamic range or kinetic energy of neural processing [ ]. Specifically, regions identified in the current study play an important role in major resting state networks: M1/PMC constitute the hubs of the motor network [ ], precuneus, mPFC, HIPP, medial STG, SPL, lateral OCCIP are hubs of the default mode network (DMN; [ , ]), and FP, anterior insula, SMG, and ACC constitute networks that have been associated with executive control and salience detection [ ]. These hub regions have been defined in structural and functional network analyses as highly connected within a certain network or community (DMN, motor [ \u2013 ]) or support communication between distinct networks (63\u201365). Therefore, we speculate that greater SD  in these hub regions likely reflects neural processing related to integrating local and distributed neural communities. In addition, several regions identified in the current study (e.g. precuneus, insula, ACC, SMG) overlap with regions where greater SD  is related to cognitive performance (21), supporting the claim that cognitive performance is thought to depend on modulating and combining the activity of neural networks in different ways [ , ]. \n\nThird, the observed relationship between PA and SD  is in line with previous findings linking physical health, measured as CRF, with brain function, especially in regions showing PA- SD  relationship in the current study. For example, older [ ] or middle-aged adults [ ] with greater CRF have greater BOLD signal amplitude in fronto-parietal regions during a selective attention task [ ] or in hippocampus, precuneus, insula, cingulate, and other frontal, temporal, and occipital regions during successful spatial encoding [ ]. Importantly, there is growing evidence from randomized control trials in older adults that 12-month bi-weekly resistance training can increase BOLD response during a selective attention task in the anterior temporal cortex and insula [ ], a 6-month aerobic training program can enhance fronto-parietal [ ] or medial prefrontal BOLD response [ ], and a 12-month aerobic walking program increases functional connectivity between regions in the default and frontal executive network [ ]. In addition, endurance-trained middle-aged adults (age 40\u201365) have greater working memory-related neural activation in multiple temporal, frontal, and parietal regions than their sedentary peers [ ]. Together, these studies suggest that fitter and more active adults show greater BOLD signal amplitude or greater functional connectivity during task performance. We speculate that the mechanisms of greater amplitude of BOLD signal fluctuations could be similar to greater SD  observed in more physically active older adults in our sample. We plan to investigate this claim directly in future studies linking SD  with functional connectivity and BOLD amplitude. In addition, further investigations (such as time frequency analysis, perfusion imaging, calibrated fMRI, and optical imaging) are needed to tease apart the effect of neural, vascular, and neurovascular coupling aspects of BOLD signal on SD  in relation to CRF and PA. In sum, SD  is a candidate brain health index that could unify and provide a better explanation of previous mixed findings based on different conventional functional neuroimaging measures. \n\n\n### CRF and PA are not equivalent in their role in functional brain health \n  \nWe did not observe the expected positive relationship between CRF and SD . We suggest that some aspects of lifestyle behaviors that influence brain function and aging may not be captured by CRF. In addition, a genetic component of CRF [ ] that adds to greater CRF regardless of PA may contribute to the associations between CRF and brain function. Alternatively, motivation or subjective threshold of exhaustion may influence the value of VO max reached during the treadmill test, especially in older low active adults, and therefore add noise to the CRF score. \n\nIn addition, it is possible that with careful preprocessing of the resting state data we removed some variance in the BOLD signal of vascular origin that would be related to cardiovascular aspects of physical health captured by CRF. As noted earlier, additional investigations with different imaging and analytical approaches are needed to tease apart vascular from neural aspects of SD . We highlight that in the current study we demonstrated in three different analyses that the relationship between PA and SD  was not driven by the motion during resting state acquisition. Neither was total relative motion directly related to SD , nor was motion related to brain scores reflecting the PA\u2014SD  relationship. Moreover, adults who had higher CRF and PA showed less motion during the resting state. We speculate this may be related to either greater physical comfort of more fit/active people in staying still (or some physical discomfort that also prevents less active individuals from engaging in PA), or their better adherence to experimental instructions. \n\nFinally, sedentary time did not significantly contribute to SD . We speculate that in our relatively low-active and low-fit sample the variance in sedentary time was not sufficient to detect robust relationships with brain function. In other words, it was LI-PA and MV-PA rather than sedentary behavior that made a difference with respect to brain functional properties in this low active, low fit but otherwise healthy older sample. An ongoing exercise intervention study including this group of participants will shed more light on the discrepancy between CRF, PA, and sedentariness in relation to brain function. \n\n\n### Both WM structure and GM function benefit from PA \n  \nWe showed that older adults with greater global FA exhibited more positive brain scores, i.e. had greater PA and greater SD . Our study therefore further extends previous reports of a positive relationship between WM microstructure and physical fitness and activity, as measured by either CRF or PA [ , \u2013 ]. We propose that anti-inflammatory and pro-myelination effects of PA on the aging brain may explain the link between PA-related SD  and WM microstructure. For example, increased PA may protect the oligodendrocytes against damage, such as related to oxidative stress [ , ] and the age-related reduction in myelin integrity [ ]. In addition, PA and exercise reduce systemic markers of inflammation [ ], while increased inflammatory markers are associated with lower WM microstructure in healthy non-demented older adults [ , ]. Together, our data suggests that PA benefits both WM microstructure and GM function, as patterns and magnitude of SD  at rest reflecting brain functional health are supported by WM microstructure in healthy aging. Future studies will assess the role of GM volume and density in these relationships. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWe demonstrated a positive association between PA, variability in the BOLD signal, and WM microstructure in healthy low-active older adults. We found that greater LI-PA and MV-PA coincided with greater SD  in regions where function is known to benefit from greater CRF and PA, and which play an important role in within and between-network communication in the brain. Therefore, our results suggest that greater PA in older age and the related physiological and neural mechanisms may support optimal neural processing in key regions, as well as WM integrity of tracts connecting these distributed regions. We conclude that SD  is a promising neural correlate of functional brain health in healthy older adults and the objective assessment of PA is an important tool in investigating functional aspects of brain health. The ongoing longitudinal and intervention studies will shed more light on the potential of SD  in detecting changes in brain function as a result of increased PA, cognitive stimulation, and dietary supplements. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4526228, "text_md5": "e63e49158c92e38b8bac688717c126ff", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 168], "journal": [169, 177], "publication_year": [179, 183], "title": [194, 307], "keywords": [321, 321], "abstract": [334, 2114], "body": [2123, 41874]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 26244873, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0134819", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4526228", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4526228"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4526228\">4526228</a>", "list_title": "PMC4526228  Physical Activity Is Linked to Greater Moment-To-Moment Variability in Spontaneous Brain Activity in Older Adults"}

All subjects were skillful touch typists and performed five tasks: a typing task, a writing task, a reading task, and two control tasks. Three brain regions were activated during both the typing and the writing tasks: the left superior parietal lobule, the left supramarginal gyrus, and the left premotor cortex close to Exner\u2019s area. Although typing and writing involved common brain regions, direct comparison between the typing and the writing task revealed greater left posteromedial intraparietal cortex activation in the typing task. In addition, activity in the left premotor cortex was more rostral in the typing task than in the writing task. These findings suggest that, although the brain circuits involved in Japanese typewriting are almost the same as those involved in handwriting, there are brain regions that are specific for typewriting. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nUse of a personal computer is common in everyday life and, accordingly, typing on a keyboard has become common for many people as a replacement for writing on paper. Recently, stroke patients with isolated typing impairment without aphasia, apraxia, or visuospatial impairment and with relative preservation of writing ability have been reported, and this phenomenon has been termed dystypia [ ]. The patient reported by Otsuki et al. had a lesion in the left frontal lobe involving the foot of the second frontal convolution and frontal operculum [ ]. Ryu et al. reported a 64-year-old right-handed man with acute infarcts in the bilateral border-zone regions, predominantly the left frontal subcortical area, who developed a sudden typing disturbance without aphasia or neglect [ ]. In addition, Cooks et al. reported a 68-year-old patient with Parkinson\u2019s disease who had a stroke in the left temporoparietal cortex and exhibited disproportionately affected typing relative to handwriting [ ]. However, it is still unknown what brain lesions are crucial for dystypia because the reported cases had multiple lesions and the locations of the lesions differed across cases. \n\nAlthough there has been a great amount of functional neuroimaging research to identify the neural basis of language comprehension (i.e., reading) and written language production (i.e., spelling and writing) [ \u2013 ], there have been very few neuroimaging studies of typewriting. Gordon et al. reported activation of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of the production of typing movements [ ], although they regarded typing as a learned finger movement and focused on the motor execution rather than the literal aspect of typewriting. Purcell et al. used fMRI to investigate the neural basis of spelling via keyboard typing and found that typed spelling activated a predominantly left hemisphere network including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), middle frontal gyrus (MFG)/superior frontal gyrus (SFG), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), SPL, and fusiform gyrus, in common with the results from lesion studies in agraphia and functional imaging studies of writing [ ]. Although overlaps in the typing and writing networks were suggested in their work, they did not compare the network for typing with that for writing in the same subjects; hence, it remains unclear whether there is a practical difference between them or not. \n\nTyping and writing words involves several cognitive processes that have been described in various cognitive models [ ,  ,  ], including: phonological long-term memory (LTM), orthographic LTM, the semantic system, phoneme-grapheme conversion, orthographic working memory (graphemic buffer), and graphic-motor planning processes ( ). For example, reading involves phonological LTM, orthographic LTM, and the semantic system. Additionally, writing involves graphic-motor planning and handwriting motor commands. Although it is supposed that reading, writing, and typing share phoneme-grapheme conversion and orthographic working memory, there may be greater demands on these processes in writing and typing than in reading. We hypothesize that if there is a difference between the neural basis of typing and writing, it might be located in the transition process (orthographic working memory or graphic-motor planning) and the motoric process, because typing and writing are thought to share the same literal central processes, i.e., the same phonological LTM, orthographic LTM, semantic system, and phoneme-grapheme conversion. However, the transition process and the motoric process are quite different between these two modalities. For example, writing requires the formation of individual letters, which can involve multiple strokes per letter. By contrast, typing is more rigid with regards to form, except with capitals. Furthermore, typing is thought to involve more parallel processing, such that prior to the execution of one letter stroke, the next letter is already prepped to be executed [ ]. Therefore, the activation of graphic-motor planning and the graphemic buffer related to the grapheme-motor command conversion process should differ between these two modalities. \n   A diagram of the assumptions underlying the present analysis.  \n(A) The cognitive model of handwriting and typing used in the present study. The labels 1, 2-W, 2-T, and 3 correspond to the labels in Fig 1B. (B) The simplified cognitive processes of typing and writing used in the present analysis. (C) The contrasts and corresponding cognitive processes. The labels 1, 2-W, 2-T, and 3 correspond to the labels in Fig 1B. Grey shading indicates conjunction contrasts. \n  \nFor the purpose of elucidating the difference between typing and writing processes, we simplified the typing model by identifying three major components: (1) reading words (i.e., converting graphemes to phonemes and semantics), (2) converting graphemes to a typing movement and planning to type the corresponding keys, and (3) moving the fingers to type the keys ( ). The writing model can similarly consist of three cognitive processes: (1) reading words, (2) converting graphemes to a writing movement and planning to write the corresponding letters, and (3) moving the hand to write the letters. \n\nThe purpose of this study was to clarify the neural processes for step (2) in typing and writing. For this purpose we performed fMRI in normal volunteers performing a typewriting task that involved typing visually presented Japanese words on an MRI-compatible QWERTY keyboard and a writing task, and directly compared the brain activity recorded in these two tasks. We utilized a subtractive approach with an underlying simplistic model using fMRI. To date, there have been a very small number of brain imaging studies of writing and typing, and this is the first study to directly compare typewriting and handwriting in the same experiment. \n\nUnlike most languages that are written using a single script, there are two writing systems in the Japanese language: kana (phonogram) and kanji (morphogram). Kana characters represent vowels or combinations of consonants and vowels, such as \u201cka\u201d, \u201cki\u201d, \u201cku\u201d, \u201cke\u201d, and \u201cko\u201d, therefore, phoneme-grapheme conversion is simpler than that of alphabetic words and Japanese kana writing does not demand knowledge of spelling. By contrast, kanji can be composed of one or more characters and there are many homonyms. We employed kana script in present study because our aim was not to elucidate the literal central processes that contain semantic and lexical processes, but the peripheral processes involved in the conversion of graphemes to the typing or writing movement (graphemic buffer and graphic-motor planning process, i.e., process (2) in  ). We employed visual word stimuli to further reduce the load of semantic and lexical processes. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nSixteen healthy volunteers (nine males and seven females, age 23\u201334 years, mean = 27.8 years, standard deviation (SD) = 3.1 years) who could touch type were recruited. All subjects were native Japanese speakers with no history of neurological or learning disorders. The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory laterality quotients [ ] ranged from 88 to 100 (mean = 99.3, SD = 2.9), indicating a strong right-hand preference in all subjects. The history of PC use ranged from 8 to 25 years (mean = 14.0 years, SD = 4.5 years) and the history of touch typing ranged from 4 to 23 years (mean = 10.4 years, SD = 5.0 years), indicating that all subjects were skillful typists. All subjects had normal vision and were able to type on a Japanese QWERTY keyboard at a rate of at least 150 characters per minute without looking at their hands (mean = 333 characters per minute, SD = 65.1 characters per minute). This typing speed was assessed in a preliminary test in which subjects were asked to type a short story called \u201cThe North Wind and the Sun\u201d from Aesop\u2019s Fables. \n\nAll participants were recruited from students and clerks at Yokohama City University and International University of Health and Welfare. The Research Ethics Committees of the International University of Health and Welfare, Mita Hospital, and Keio University approved the experimental procedures. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to the experiment. \n\n\n### Tasks and stimuli \n  \nTwo conditions, each consisting of three tasks, were designed for the fMRI scan paradigm: the typing condition and the writing condition. The typing condition consisted of the typing task, the reading task, and the typing-movement task. The writing condition consisted of the writing task, the reading task, and the writing-movement task. Tasks were performed across six scanning sessions: three sessions for the typing condition and three sessions for the writing condition. Typing and writing sessions were alternated. Before each session, subjects were instructed on condition they were going to perform. In each session, five blocks of stimuli were pseudo-randomly presented: two writing or typing tasks, two movement tasks, and one reading task (see details below). The order of sessions was varied across subjects. A summary of each experiment is presented in Figs   and  . \n   Design of the typing experiment.  \nThe typing experiment used an fMRI block design. Each session consisted of three different tasks presented pseudo-randomly in five blocks of 20-s duration. All tasks had a fixation condition. In the typing-movement task (C), subjects were instructed to type randomly with both hands when the double circle symbol was present on the monitor. fMRI: functional magnetic resonance imaging. \n     Design of the writing experiment.  \nThe writing experiment used an fMRI block design that was almost the same as the typing experiment. Each session consisted of three different tasks presented pseudo-randomly in five blocks of 20-s duration. In the writing-movement task (C), subjects were instructed to move their right index finger randomly when the double circle symbol was present on the monitor. Subjects had practiced this task before the scan. fMRI: functional magnetic resonance imaging. \n  \nWe adopted and modified a paradigm originally employed by Katanoda et al. for the writing and typing tasks [ ]. In this paradigm, it is assumed that the process of typing or writing can be divided into three cognitive components, as mentioned in the Introduction ( ). The \u201ctyping > reading\u201d contrast was assumed to represent processes (2-T) and (3), and the \u201ctyping > typing-movement\u201d contrast was assumed to represent processes (1) and (2-T). Therefore, the process we were most interested in for typewriting, i.e., (2-T), was calculated by the conjunction analysis of the \u201ctyping > reading\u201d and \u201ctyping > typing-movement\u201d contrasts. In the same manner, the conjunction analysis of the \u201cwriting > reading\u201d and \u201cwriting > writing-movement\u201d contrasts was expected to reveal the neural substrates of process (2-W) that are crucial for the processing of writing ( ). \n\nPrior to participation in the actual experiment, each subject practiced the keyboard typing task and the writing task while lying down to ensure that they could perform the tasks. Subjects also practiced the movement tasks to ensure that they had similar timing, spatial range, speed, and use of both hands as in the typing and writing tasks. We instructed subjects not to type or write actual words or simple bigrams in the movement tasks. During this practice session, finger movements or typed outputs for each task were checked by eye to confirm that the subject performed the tasks almost perfectly. We recorded which hand was used to press each key to calculate the difference between the right hand and the left hand usage in the actual typewriting tasks. \n\n\n### Typing condition \n  \nIn each fMRI session for the typing condition, we presented five pseudo-randomly ordered 20-s blocks of stimuli that consisted of the typing task (n = 2 blocks), the reading task (n = 1 block), and the typing-movement task (n = 2 blocks). Between each block and at the end of the fifth block, a fixation cross appeared for 15 s to signify a period of rest. This 15-s fixation period occurred six times in each fMRI session. Subjects were instructed to keep their hands on the home keys (\u201cj\u201d and \u201cf\u201d) when at rest. Home keys were identifiable to the touch by a small bump on the keys. We took great care to ensure that subjects were in a comfortable typing position prior to the start of scanning. The keyboard was positioned on the subject\u2019s waist. Head movement was minimized by placing small foam cushions on each side of the subject\u2019s head. Subjects were instructed not to correct any mistakes that were made during scan sessions. \n\n#### 1. Typing task \n  \nIn the typing task, a word was presented on a screen and the subject was instructed to type the visually presented word on a keyboard (Fujitsu CP218230-02) that had been modified for use in the scanner by eliminating all ferro-magnetic components. The word list for the task consisted of 110 kana nouns obtained from the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone corporation (NTT) psycholinguistic database called \"Lexical Properties of Japanese\" [ ]. Words were matched on linguistic parameters including word frequency, imagability, number of syllables, and key positions on the QWERTY keyboard so as not to require unequal hand usage. All words consisted of four or five kana characters (seven to nine alphabetic characters) and did not include the Roman characters q, w, z, x, c, v, p, or l, because there are relatively few opportunities to press these keys in the Japanese language and these characters are located in the corners of the QWERTY keyboard ( ). No word was shown more than once in the experiment (i.e., the six scanning sessions containing the writing, reading, and the typing conditions). \n   Positions of the keys required to type the words included in the word list.  \nThe typing task required the subjects to type the letters corresponding to the red colored keys. The keys q, w, z, x, c, v, p, and l were excluded because there are few opportunities to press these keys for Japanese typists and these keys are located in the corners of the QWERTY keyboard. \n  \nBefore the typing task, a picture of a hand, which indicated that the subject should type, was presented for 2000 ms followed by six different words presented sequentially over a period of 18000 ms with no interval and subjects were instructed to type each word on the keyboard ( ). We adopted the most popular way of typing Japanese called \u201calphabetical input\u201d. In this method, a western-style keyboard is used, and the kana character \u201cka\u201d is produced by typing \u201ck\u201d followed by \u201ca\u201d [ ]. Although there are other ways of typing, all subjects were instructed to type using the alphabetical input method. \n\nThe keys pressed were recorded through the optical fibers placed in the keyboard buttons and the accuracy of typewriting was calculated offline. The percentage of left-hand and right-hand usage on the keyboard was calculated for each word to ensure that there was no bias in hand use. Behavioral data obtained from the typing experiment were processed in MATLAB 7.7.0 (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Accurate trials were defined as those for which subjects produced the correct key-pressing sequence for a given word. We were primarily interested in spelling errors as opposed to typing errors such as a slip in a keypress to the adjacent key, and we therefore did not consider key presses that were either one to the right or left of the correct key to be incorrect (e.g. for the letter \u201cy\u201d, \u201ct\u201d or \u201cu\u201d were considered correct). Typing speed (number of keys per second) was calculated offline to check the difference between consecutive key presses for each trial involving a motor control task. \n\n\n#### 2. Reading task \n  \nFor the reading task, a picture of a book, which indicated that the subject should read, was presented for 2000 ms followed by six different words presented sequentially over a period of 18000 ms with no interval, and subjects were instructed to read each word silently and not to move their fingers ( ). The word list for the reading task was the same as that used in the writing task, and no word was shown more than once in the experiment. \n\n\n#### 3. Typing-movement task \n  \nIn the typing-movement task, which was designed as a control, a double circle (\u25ce) was presented for 2000-ms periods with a blank screen presented for 1000 ms between each period, and subjects were instructed to type randomly with both hands at a pre-learned speed during the presentation of the double circle ( ). Behavioral data were obtained in the same manner as for the typing task. \n\n\n\n### Writing condition \n  \nIn each fMRI session for the writing condition, we presented five pseudo-randomly ordered 20-s blocks of stimuli that consisted of the writing task (n = 2 blocks), the reading task (n = 1 block), and the writing-movement task (n = 2 blocks). Between each block and at the end of the fifth block, a fixation cross appeared for 15 s to signify a period of rest. This 15-s fixation period appeared six times in each fMRI session. \n\n#### 1. Writing task \n  \nIn the writing task, subjects were instructed to write words with their right index finger in the air. It is natural for Japanese people to write with the index finger in the air, and they often move their index finger to trace the imagined letter. Before the task, a picture of a hand, which indicated that the subject should write, was presented for 2000 ms followed by six different words presented sequentially over a period of 18000 ms with no interval and subjects were instructed to trace each word in the air with their index finger in Japanese phonograms (kana) ( ). The word list for this task was the same as that used in the typing condition. During the fMRI scan, finger movements were checked by examiners via a video monitor. \n\n\n#### 2. Reading task \n  \nFor the reading task, a picture of a book, which indicated that the subject should read, was presented for 2000 ms followed by six different words presented sequentially over a period of 18000 ms with no interval, and subjects were instructed to read each word silently ( ). The word list for the reading task was the same as that used in the typing condition. \n\n\n#### 3. Writing-movement task \n  \nIn the writing-movement task, a double circle (\u25ce) was presented and subjects were instructed to move their index finger randomly at a pre-learned speed, in the way they do when they write in the air. The double circle was presented for 2500-ms periods with a blank screen presented for 500 ms between each period ( ). The stimulus duration in the writing-movement task was longer than that in the typing-movement task to control for the difference in the time taken to complete these two tasks. During the fMRI scan, finger movements were checked by examiners via a video monitor. \n\n\n\n### Visual stimuli \n  \nVisual stimuli were presented on a screen mounted on a head coil through a projector (Victor, Japan, DLA-HD10KS, spatial resolution 1024 \u00d7 768 pixels, refresh rate 60 Hz) outside the scanner room. Pictures were grayscale images (Figs   and  ). Stimulus presentation was synchronized with the pulses of the fMRI scanner and was controlled by E-Prime software ( ) run on a Windows PC. \n\n\n### Data acquisition \n  \nAll MRI experiments were performed using a Tim-Trio MR scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a standard 12-channel head matrix coil operating at 3.0 Tesla. After initial localizer images had been obtained, T1-weighed anatomical images were obtained with an inversion recovery-prepared magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence with a matrix size of 256 \u00d7 256 over a field of view of 256 mm, and a slice thickness of 1 mm. For functional imaging, we used single-shot gradient-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) with a repetition time of 2500 ms, echo time of 30 ms, flip angle of 90\u00b0, field of view of 240 mm, matrix size of 64 \u00d7 64, and slice thickness of 3.6 mm with no gap. Seventy-six slices parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line were acquired for each volume. We acquired 76 volumes in each of the six sessions, leading to a total of 456 volumes per subject. \n\n\n### Image processing \n  \nData analysis was carried out using SPM8 (available at  ) implemented in MATLAB 7.7.0 (MathWorks Inc.) applying the general linear model [ ]. The anatomical MPRAGE image was normalized to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) reference anatomical template brain [ ]. We corrected for head motion by realigning each scan to the first image, co-registering the functional scans with the anatomical MPRAGE scan, and then normalizing them via the same warping parameters used to normalize the MPRAGE scan. The images were then re-sliced to 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm  and smoothed with an 8-mm full-width at half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nThe first volume of EPI in each task was excluded from the statistical analyses because it contained the task instructions. The experimental conditions were modeled as box-car functions convolved with the hemodynamic response function with a time derivative. Global scaling was not used, high-pass temporal filtering with a cut-off of 128 s was applied, and serial autocorrelations were modeled with an autoregressive (AR 1) model in SPM8. Eleven contrasts were estimated for each subject: typing > fix, reading > fix, writing > fix, typing movement > fix, writing movement > fix, typing > reading, writing > reading, typing > typing movement, writing > writing movement, typing > writing, and writing > typing. \n\nThe second-level group study was based on a random effects model, to account for between-subject variance and to allow inference at the population level. The summary scans of the 16 subjects were compared using 11 one-sample   t  -tests, one for each of the 11 comparisons performed. Finally, we obtained 11 statistical maps for the group. We report the results obtained at   p   < 0.05, voxel-wise corrected for multiple comparisons using the family-wise error correction for the whole brain with a spatial extent larger than 30 voxels and cluster-level corrected at   p   < 0.05. \n\nAreas of activation associated with typing were identified by examining the \u201ctyping > reading\u201d contrast and \u201ctyping > typing movement\u201d contrast. To exclude clusters in which typing activation was negative in relation to the baseline fixation condition, we applied a mask generated by the \u201ctyping > fix\u201d contrast at a low threshold of uncorrected   p   < 0.05 to the activation maps generated in the \u201ctyping > reading\u201d contrast and \u201ctyping > typing movement\u201d contrast. For the same reason, we applied a mask generated by the \u201cwriting > fix\u201d contrast at a low threshold of uncorrected   p   < 0.05 to the activation maps generated in the \u201cwriting > reading\u201d contrast and the \u201cwriting > writing movement\u201d contrast. \n\nNext, we used a conjunction method to identify the regions that were the most crucial for typing and writing, namely processes (2-T) and (2-W) in  . The two conjunctions tested were: (a) \u201ctyping > reading\u201d and \u201ctyping > typing movement\u201d, and (b) \u201cwriting > reading\u201d and \u201cwriting > writing movement\u201d, using the statistical maps generated in the prior analyses. \n\nAdditionally, to elucidate the difference between the neural substrates for typing and writing, we compared the \u201ctyping > typing movement\u201d contrast and the \u201cwriting > writing movement\u201d contrast directly by constructing the (typing > typing movement) > (writing > writing movement) contrast and (writing > writing movement) > (typing > typing movement) contrast. \n\nIn summary, we tested six contrasts: typing > reading, writing > reading, typing > typing movement, writing > writing movement, (typing > typing movement) > (writing > writing movement), and (writing > writing movement) > (typing > typing movement), and two conjunctions: (a) typing > reading and typing > typing movement, (b) writing > reading and writing > writing movement ( ). \n\nThe coordinates of the statistically significant activations were expressed in MNI space and the anatomical localization of the statistical maps was determined with reference to the SPM Anatomy Toolbox Atlas [ ] and the Anatomical Automatic Labeling atlas developed for MNI space [ ]. Brodmann areas (BAs) were identified from the template developed for MRIcron. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral data \n  \nThe total number of keys pressed during the typing task was 278.1 (SD = 7.20), the difference between the right hand and the left hand usage (i.e.; the number of keys pressed by the right hand minus the number pressed by the left hand) was -4.75 (SD = 5.09), and the accuracy of typing was 96.34% (SD = 4.83%), indicating that all subjects achieved the typing tasks almost perfectly using both hands. The total number of keys pressed during the typing-movement task was 419.9 (SD = 86.8) and the difference between the right hand and the left hand usage was 5.31 (SD = 42.4). There was no linguistic structure or repeated bigrams in the output of the typing-movement task. The mean typing speed was 2.56 keys per second (SD = 1.20 keys per second) during the typing task, and 5.83 keys per second (SD = 0.07 keys per second) during the typing-movement task. The number and speed of keys pressed in the typing-movement task was therefore larger and faster, respectively, than that in the typing task. Due to these differences, no activation associated with writing movement and key pressing should be present in the subtracted contrasts. \n\n\n### Group analysis of MRI data \n  \nThe results of the random effects group analysis are summarized in Tables  \u2013  and  . The results of the \u201ctyping > typing movement\u201d contrast are shown in   and  . Several activated areas were present including the bilateral inferior occipital gyri extending to the left inferior temporal cortex, the left frontoparietal areas such as the SPL, the posterior part of the left MFG, the upper and lower parts of the left pre-central gyrus, and the left IFG, corresponding to Broca\u2019s area. \n   Brain areas activated in the typing and writing experiments.  \nEach brain area was projected on a standard rendered SPM template brain. All maps were thresholded at a significance level of   p   < 0.05 voxel-wise corrected for multiple comparisons using family-wise error correction.

The local maxima of activated regions in the conjunction analysis.        \nThe results of the \u201ctyping > reading\u201d contrast are shown in   and  . Large extents of the bilateral frontoparietal regions were significantly activated. Activated regions included the bilateral pre-central gyrus, the left SPL, and the right middle cingulate gyrus. The left cerebellum, including the left vermis, and the left hemisphere were also significantly activated. Subcortical activation was observed in the bilateral thalamus. \n\nThe regions that demonstrated significant activation for the \u201cwriting > writing movement\u201d contrast are shown in   and  . The activated areas were the bilateral inferior occipital gyri spreading into the left inferior temporal cortex, the left frontoparietal areas including the left SPL and the SMG, the left pre-central gyrus, and the posterior end of the left MFG.

The main cerebral activation was observed in two regions in the left hemisphere: the anterior portion of the SPL extending to the SMG and the posterior part of the MFG/SFG. Activation in the posteromedial part of the left intraparietal sulcus (IPS) just superior to the angular gyrus (AG) and the right cerebellum was also observed.

Because of this difference from writing and the existence of dystypia, an isolated typing disorder, we hypothesized that there would be some differences in the neural networks for typewriting and handwriting, especially in the peripheral transition processes. \n\nOur fMRI study revealed three brain regions activated during both tasks: the left anterior SPL, the left SMG, and the posterior end of the left MFG/SFG. These brain regions, known as the \u201cwriting centers\u201d from numerous lesion studies and neuroimaging studies, were activated in both the typewriting and the writing task. Additionally, we identified a typing-specific brain region: the left posteromedial IPS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fMRI study to compare the neural basis of Japanese keyboard typing and writing directly in the same individuals and to focus on the left frontoparietal brain regions. \n\n### The left SPL \n  \nThe conjunction between the \u201ctyping > typing movement\u201d and \u201ctyping > reading\u201d contrasts showed peak activation in the anterior part of the left SPL (MNI peak: -28, -58, 60) and the conjunction between the \u201cwriting > writing movement\u201d and \u201cwriting > reading\u201d contrasts showed almost the same activation region (MNI peak: -26, -58, 60). \n\nThe left SPL is responsible for sequence production in written language [ \u2013 ]. Damage to the left SPL is associated with apraxic agraphia, an impairment in writing in which the orthographic production of letters and words is abnormal despite normal sensorimotor function and word and letter knowledge [ ,  ]. fMRI studies have reported left SPL activation during writing [ ,  ,  ,  ] and a meta-analysis of fMRI studies of the brain region responsible for English written word production indicated a left anterior SPL/IPL cluster that was associated with the peripheral but not central processes of written word production (MNI peak: -36, -40, 57) [ ]. Katanoda et al. and Sugihara et al. used fMRI to examine the neural substrates for writing Japanese kana characters and also reported activation of the left SPL (MNI peak: -32, -38, 56 and -36, -42, 48) [ ,  ]. These data indicate that the left SPL is an essential brain region for writing both English alphabetic words and Japanese kana characters. \n\nIn addition, our data suggest the same brain region, the left SPL, was also activated in the typewriting task. These results suggest that the left SPL is not only the writing center, but also the typing center. Although no lesion studies have implicated the left SPL in dystypia, Magrassi et al. reported a patient who exhibited handwritten and typed production errors, but no errors in oral spelling, after electrical stimulation of a restricted area of the SPL [ ]. Recent functional imaging studies have made the same proposal. For example, Gordon et al. used fMRI to examine brain activation during the production of typing motor sequences and indicated activation of the SPL [ ], and Purcell et al. investigated the neural basis of spelling during keyboard typing and reported fMRI activation of clusters in the left SPL (MNI peak: -28, -60, 46). These previous data and our results strongly suggest that activation of this region is involved in both writing and typing. The left SPL has also been associated with the planning or generation of complex sequential movements regardless of writing [ ] and the integration of the body schema with ego-centric frames of reference [ ]. In this respect, it is also possible that the activation of this area was the consequence of complex sequential finger movements, regardless of writing or typing processes. However, our results demonstrating the important role of the left SPL were drawn from subtraction of the motor execution process using control tasks. \n\n\n### The left SMG \n  \nThe conjunction between the \u201ctyping > typing movement\u201d and \u201ctyping > reading\u201d contrasts and the conjunction between the \u201cwriting > writing movement\u201d and \u201cwriting > reading\u201d contrasts showed activation in the left SMG. The left SMG has been shown by numerous neuropsychological studies to be important for writing, especially phoneme-grapheme conversion. Lesions in the left SMG have been associated with phonological agraphia, which is defined as a loss of ability to write using phoneme-grapheme conversion [ ,  ,  ]. Impaired spelling of pronounceable pseudowords is a characteristic of phonological agraphia. SMG lesion has been reported in patients with pure agraphia for kana (Japanese phonograms), which is characterized by errors in literal paragraphia (substitutions, additions, and omissions of letters) [ ]. Despite a large number of studies of patients with left SMG lesions, there are no functional neuroimaging studies that have reported involvement of the left SMG in alphabet writing [ ]. In this study we employed Japanese phonograms (kana), which are known to rely heavily on phoneme-grapheme conversion, rather than kanji or alphabetic words, as mentioned in the Introduction. In a previous neuroimaging study, the left SMG was active in a kana-writing task that placed a strong demand on phoneme-grapheme conversion [ ,  ]. With regard to typewriting, we found significant activation in the left SMG extended from the left SPL. Alphabetical input is the most popular way of Japanese keyboard typing, and was the method of keyboard typing that we employed in this study. To perform alphabetical input typing, the subject has to separate the phoneme into the corresponding vowel and consonant. For instance, the kana character \u2018ka\u2019 is produced by typing \u2018k\u2019 followed by \u2018a\u2019 [ ]. We suggest that Japanese typewriting needs much greater phoneme-grapheme conversion than alphabetic writing, and this may explain the left SMG activation in the typing task. \n\n\n### The left IPS \n  \nThe conjunction between the \u201ctyping > typing movement\u201d and \u201ctyping > reading\u201d contrasts showed small peak activations in the left IPS just superior to the AG (MNI peak: -30, -60, 38), and the (typing > typing movement) > (writing > writing movement) contrast revealed significant activation in the left posteromedial part of the IPS (MNI peak: -28, -60, 42). These results indicated that these IPS regions were activated to a greater degree in the typing task than in the writing task ( ). A meta-analysis of fMRI studies for English written word production that contained a typewriting task indicated that the posterior part of the IPS cluster was activated during central spelling processes, and this is very close to our activated area for typewriting (MNI peak: -30, -60, 46) [ ]. Lesion studies have revealed that damage to the left IPS/SPL sparing the AG can result in spelling deficits associated with orthographic working memory [ ]. From this point of view, our results could suggest higher orthographic working memory demands in typewriting than in handwriting. It is also possible that these results reflect the difference in the grapheme-motor command conversion process related to orthographic working memory. On the other hand, it is reasonable to suppose that handwriting requires more online working memory resources, because it takes longer. The lack of behavioral data prevents us from making a conclusion and further study is needed to make a comparison of the working memory demands between these two modalities. \n   Overlap of the MFG activated regions obtained from the conjunction analysis of typing and writing.  \nOverlap of the MFG activated regions obtained from the conjunction analysis of typing (red) and writing (blue). The green area represents the voxels that were identified in both contrasts. Overlap between two conjunctions was observed and the typing activity extended to dorsolateral and rostral region. MFG: middle frontal gyrus. \n  \nIn addition to such processes, another difference between typing and writing is the properties of the tools used, i.e., the keyboard vs. the pen. The keyboard places demands on highly specific space representations and on sequential on-line control of key-stroke actions. Traditionally, the left parietal cortex is considered as a major region responsible for actual tool use, and damage to this region is known to be associated with apraxia. Recent neuropsychological and neuroimaging data suggest that parietal regions, that is, the dorsal and medial parietal cortex, contribute to on-line monitoring/adjusting of ongoing prehensile action for tools [ ]. Grefkes et al. proposed that the medial IPS was also crucial for transforming visual coordinates into motor programs and was activated bilaterally in the online control of goal-directed precision movements [ ,  ]. It is interesting that only the left IPS was activated in our study. It is possible that our left-dependent activation is due to methodological differences between our study and that of Grefkes et al., as typewriting can be regarded as requiring language-specific visuomotor coordination of hand movements associated with the dominant hemisphere. Nevertheless, there might be another explanation for the laterality. A recent functional imaging study demonstrated that the bilateral IPS was significantly activated during mental rotation tasks known to be associated with visual representation [ ]. Voyer et al. revealed that the functional lateralization of mental rotation processes was modulated by the skill with which the task was performed. With increasing practice there was a shift from a right hemisphere dominance to a left hemisphere dominance [ ]. In accordance with their proposal, it is possible that left IPS activation during the typing task was due to the keyboard property as an over-learned visuospatial association tool. \n\nOur results showed no activation of the left AG. Dejerine\u2019s classic study and subsequent lesion studies support the role of the left AG as a center of lexical processing that underlies both spelling and reading [ ,  ,  ]. In this respect, it is reasonable that our conjunction analyses for both typing and writing did not reveal any activation in the left AG, because our experiment aimed to elucidate the peripheral processes and placed very few demands on central processes such as semantic and lexical processes, as described in the Introduction. \n\n\n### The left MFG/SFG \n  \nWe identified significant activation associated with both the typing and the writing task in the left MFG/SFG, corresponding to the premotor cortex. The conjunction between the \u201ctyping > typing movement\u201d and \u201ctyping > reading\u201d contrasts showed peak activation in the posterior part of the MFG/SFG (MNI peak: -28, -6, 58), and the conjunction between the \u201cwriting > writing movement\u201d and \u201cwriting > reading\u201d contrasts showed activation ventromedial and caudal to that of the typing conjunction contrast (MNI peak: -22, -12, 50) ( ). \n\nPatients with lesions in the left MFG and IFG, known as Exner\u2019s area [ ,  ], experience writing disturbances characterized by the omission of words in a sentence or badly written words. Japanese patients with pure agraphia due to damage to Exner\u2019s area are frequently reported to have a kana-dominant writing impairment including paragraphia [ ,  ]. These lesion studies have led to the left dorsal premotor cortex being considered relevant to writing-specific processes that involve the generation of graphemic motor commands or a graphemic buffer for writing. The graphemic buffer is a working memory component of the spelling system that temporarily holds the sequence of graphemes during production of letter names for oral spelling or letter shapes for written spelling. Cloutman et al. studied stroke patients using magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging to identify neuroanatomical regions associated with deficits to the graphemic buffer [ ]. They found that the voxels most strongly associated with the graphemic buffer were in the pre-central and premotor cortex, involving BA 4 and 6, and the post-central gyrus, involving BA 2 and 3. Rapp and Dufor reported that the left superior frontal sulcus (MNI peak: -13, -11, 51) was the word-length-sensitive neural substrate in spelling [ ] and hypothesized that this region was involved in orthographic working memory (i.e., the graphemic buffer) rather than the generation of graphemic motor commands. However, Roux et al. named this area the \u201cGraphemic/Motor Frontal Area\u201d [ ]. They conducted a direct cortical stimulation and fMRI study and proposed that the area might correspond to the neural counterpart of the interface between the orthographic or graphemic abstract representations and the generation of motor commands for handwriting [ ,  ]. \n\nOur data, however, revealed significant activation of the same brain regions during the typewriting tasks, indicating that this brain region was crucial not only for writing, but also for typing. Although it is difficult to clarify the actual role of the left MFG/SMG from our data, it is possible that the typed spelling was held in the graphemic buffer, or that the conversion of orthographic representations into typing-motor representations was produced in this area. Interestingly, a recent study has revealed that this region also plays a significant role in graphemic motor commands for typed production [ ]. \n\nIt is noteworthy that a direct comparison between the two left MFG/SFG activated clusters obtained from typing and writing conjunctions revealed a small gap ( ). The activation observed in the typing conjunction was located dorsolateral and rostral to that observed in the writing conjunction, and only the rostral region had stronger activation in the typing task than in the writing task ( , red region). Although a direct comparison between the typing and writing revealed no significant difference in this area, it is possible that the left MFG/SFG is used in both modalities, but in different ways. The rostral premotor areas contain a greater proportion of neurons with sensory properties, whereas caudal areas contain a greater proportion with motor properties [ ,  ]. Moreover, Simon et al. suggested that the region of the dorsal premotor area activated for motor preparation is located caudally and that activated for spatial attention and memory is located at a more rostral site [ ]. Therefore, the more rostral activation in typing found in the present study might be due to greater sensory demand or spatial attention in typewriting than in writing. However, further study is needed to determine the difference related to this area. \n\n\n### Crucial brain lesions for dystypia \n  \nOur study revealed a brain region that was dominant in typewriting over writing: the left posteromedial portion of the left IPS. In addition, activity in the left MFG/SFG was more rostral in the typing task than in the writing task. Therefore, we hypothesize that brain lesions in these areas could result in dystypia. The dystypia case reported by Ryu et al. had lesions in the bilateral border-zone regions, predominantly the left dorsal frontal area, that were relatively close to our left MFG/SFG activated area [ ]. The patient reported by Cooks et al. had a lesion in the left temporoparietal region, which might have contained the left IPS [ ]. These two case reports are therefore concordant with our hypothesis. However, the patient reported by Otsuki et al. had a lesion in the left frontal lobe that involved the foot of the second frontal convolution and frontal operculum, which seems to be lower than our left MFG activation [ ]. Of course, it is difficult to draw conclusions on the brain regions critical for dystypia using only these three cases, and there might be several reasons for the inconsistency between the previous case reports and our results. First, the inconsistency may be due to individual anatomical variability in the typing and writing centers. Sugihara et al. reported inter-individual variability in the location of the writing center in the lower part of the anterior limb of the left SMG and other brain regions in the right hemisphere [ ]. Hence, it is possible that the typing center in left lower part of the MFG/IFG was not consistent across individuals. Furthermore, the way in which subjects had learned to touch type is likely more variable than the way they learned to write, because writing, but not typing, must be mastered during compulsory education in Japan. This might result in further inter-individual variability. Second, although the patients from Ryu et al. and Cook et al. were able to type words without visual assistance, i.e.; touch type, similar to our subjects, the patient described by Otsuki et al. did not adopt the touch-typing technique. However, further studies need to be carried out to determine whether there is a difference in the neural substrate for non-touch typing and touch typing. In addition, further case reports are necessary to identify the functional networks in the brain that are involved in typing and writing. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe current study examined the neural substrate for typing and compared it with that of writing in the same subjects. First, using a conjunction analysis, we identified the following three areas as crucial for the neural process of typing and writing: (1) the anterior part of the left SPL, (2) the left SMG, and (3) the posterior part of the left MFG/SFG, near Exner's area. These results demonstrate that the brain regions known as the \u201cwriting center\u201d were also the neural center for typing. Second, a direct comparison between typing and writing revealed a typing-specific brain region: the left posteromedial IPS. In addition, activity in the left MFG/SFG was more rostral in the typing task than in the writing task. These findings provide the first evidence that the brain activity involved in Japanese typing is different from that involved in writing. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4517759, "text_md5": "9ef9b71a7e55750cee258b3b6e99061a", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 105], "journal": [106, 114], "publication_year": [116, 120], "title": [131, 186], "keywords": [200, 200], "abstract": [213, 1320], "body": [1329, 50318]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 26218431, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0134131", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4517759", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4517759"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4517759\">4517759</a>", "list_title": "PMC4517759  The Neural Basis of Typewriting: A Functional MRI Study"}

Existing research has shown that when chronic dieters\u2019 self-regulatory capacity is challenged by prior exertion of effort, they demonstrate disinhibited eating and altered patterns of brain activity when exposed to food cues. However, the relationship between brain activity during self-control exertion and subsequent food cue exposure remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated whether individual differences in recruitment of cognitive control regions during a difficult response inhibition task are associated with a failure to regulate neural responses to rewarding food cues in a subsequent task in a cohort of 27 female dieters. During self-control exertion, participants recruited regions commonly associated with inhibitory control, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Those dieters with higher DLPFC activity during the initial self-control task showed an altered balance of food cue elicited activity in regions associated with reward and self-control, namely: greater reward-related activity and less recruitment of the frontoparietal control network. These findings suggest that some dieters may be more susceptible to the effects of self-control exertion than others and, whether due to limited capacity or changes in motivation, these dieters subsequently fail to engage control regions that may otherwise modulate activity associated with craving and reward. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nBroadly defined, self-regulation refers to the human capacity to flexibly regulate thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Self-control, in particular, describes those situations in which self-regulatory processes are engaged to inhibit prepotent or automatic impulses, especially when these impulses conflict with other goals ( ;  ;  ). In situations when impulses and cravings are relatively weak, less effort is required to engage in self-control. However, at other times, self-control can be experienced as effortful. A large body of research in experimental psychology has examined how the effects of exerting self-control in one domain can lead to self-regulation failure in other domains, resulting in the hypothesis that self-regulation is dependent on limited cognitive resources that can become depleted over subsequent self-regulation attempts ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nMost recently, the consensus appears to be that the available evidence, in favor of and/or against self-regulatory depletion effects, is inconclusive ( ). However, a recent pre-registered study with large samples (Ns \u2265 377) has shown reliable effects consistent with an attentional-based account of depletion ( ), and studies using more ecologically valid designs have provided supporting evidence for the role of self-regulatory fatigue in precipitating self-control failures in daily life ( ;  ), suggesting, perhaps, that focusing on more ecologically valid and appetitive behaviors (such as dieting failures) may provide better traction on the underlying phenomena. \n\nOne population that may be particularly susceptible to self-control fatigue is chronic dieters (i.e.,\u00a0those who constantly monitor and attempt to control their food intake) as they frequently demonstrate weight fluctuations, weight gain, and self-control lapses ( ;  ;  ), including after effortful self-control exertion ( ;  ;  ). Much of this prior work has generally treated dieters as a homogenous group, comparing these to non-dieters or to groups of dieters who were not \u201cfatigued\u201d by self-control exertion (e.g.,\u00a0\u00a0 ). However, more recent work has taken an individual differences approach to better understand why   some   dieters may be more prone to self-control failure than others. For example, prior work in our lab has shown that those dieters who experience weaker food cravings and more positive mood in daily life are also most successful in controlling impulses to eat ( ). Another study revealed that after initial exertion of (effortful) self-control, dieters variably recruited brain regions associated with self-control and reward when exposed to appetizing food cues, and these differences predicted self-control outcomes in daily life ( ). However, this study did not measure brain activity during the initial self-control task. So, a key unanswered question is: are individual differences in recruitment of self-control brain regions during self-control exertion in dieters related to altered patterns of activity in brain regions associated with control and reward when dieters are subsequently exposed to appetizing food cues? Additionally, might a relationship between brain activity during self-control exertion and later exposure to tempting food cues itself predict self-regulation failures (i.e.,\u00a0overeating) in more ecologically valid settings? \n\nTo address these questions, we used functional neuroimaging in the present study to examine individual differences in the neural correlates of effortful self-control among chronic dieters and related activation in prefrontal regions associated with response inhibition to subsequent recruitment of control and reward-related brain areas during exposure to appetitive food commercials. In addition to their constant deployment of self-control, the dieting population is characterized by a motivation to regulate food intake, allowing for cleaner operationalization of self-control success and failure. In a recent brain imaging study, dieters randomly assigned to first complete an effortful self-control task showed, on average, significantly higher activity in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key region in the brain\u2019s reward system; ( ;  ;  ) during subsequent exposure to food cues, as well as reduced functional coupling between inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), an area of lateral prefrontal cortex, and the OFC\u2014relative to dieters assigned to the control condition ( ). These findings indicated that when dieters engage in effortful self-control, the reward value of food may become amplified while self-control capacity\u2014as indexed by reduced functional connectivity between OFC and IFG\u2014may be compromised. \n\nWork in cognitive neuroscience has identified lateral prefrontal cortex as a robust neural correlate of self-control, indexing one\u2019s capacity to engage in response inhibition (see\u00a0 \u00a0for a review). Lateral prefrontal cortex has also been implicated in successful resistance of desires to smoke cigarettes as well as regulate food cravings in daily life ( ;  ). Additionally, several studies have found a general pattern such that, following initial exertion of self-control, activity in lateral prefrontal cortex subsequently decreases on subsequent tasks ( ;  ;  ;  ) and the magnitude of this decrease has been found to be correlated with performance deficits in subsequent cognitive tasks ( ;  ). Moreover, these effects may be most pronounced in contexts where people are required to inhibit responses to stimuli with high reward value ( ). \n\nGiven these previous lines of work on self-control among dieters and the role prefrontal cortex plays in effortful self-control in the cognitive domain, we hypothesized that individual differences in dieters\u2019 recruitment of lateral prefrontal cortex during initial self-control exertion would be associated with: (1) altered brain responses during subsequent exposure to food commercials, and (2) ad libitum eating patterns following a later diet breaking episode. To test these hypotheses, we first measured brain activity as dieters performed an effortful self-control task in which they were required to actively inhibit reading a series of words that appeared on the screen over the course of seven minutes. Following this, participants engaged in a food-cue reactivity task involving food commercials that has previously been shown to reliably recruit the brain\u2019s reward system ( ). This dual-task design allowed us to examine the correspondence between task-elicited activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex during self-control exertion in the first task and the balance between regions associated with self-control and those associated with food-reward in the second task. Here, we focus specifically on the relative balance of activity in regions associated with self-control and reward during exposure to food commercials, as our previous work has associated this balance measure with failure to resist the desire to eat in daily life, as measured by experience sampling ( ). As some have recently argued that self-control capacity may be better captured by the coordination of whole brain systems that support regulatory processes (e.g.,\u00a0frontoparietal control network), rather than activity of discrete, independent regions ( ), this balance measure was calculated using a systems-based approach. Following the procedure used previously in Lopez and colleagues (2017), we used independently defined,   a priori   regions/systems of interest, namely the frontoparietal control network, which enables flexible exertion of self-control ( ), and key regions of the reward system, namely OFC and ventral striatum, both of which reliably activate to appetizing food images ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nTo constrain our hypotheses about potential relationships between PFC activity during effortful self-control and subsequent recruitment of control (vs. reward) regions during food cue exposure, we based our hypotheses on prior neuroimaging studies ( ;  ) that suggest that following (effortful) exertion of self-control, there is less recruitment of lateral prefrontal cortex, compared to control groups that did not exert self-control, in a subsequent task requiring self-regulation. Thus, in line with this work we focused on individual differences among a group of dieters and hypothesized that dieters showing   more   recruitment of prefrontal cortex during effortful self-control, indexing task difficulty and/or the experience of effort, would subsequently show   less   recruitment of the frontoparietal control network and therefore   more   reward-related activity in OFC and VS when viewing food commercials\u2014thus serving as evidence of a failure to appropriately engage self-control systems when confronted with appetitive food stimuli. Finally, we also hypothesized that higher PFC activity during effortful self-control, and/or lower frontoparietal (vs. reward) balance scores, would be associated with more disinhibited eating following a diet breaking episode\u2014as measured in separate experimental session with the same participants. \n\n\n## Materials & Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThirty-two female dieters (M \u00a0=\u00a019.48, SD \u00a0=\u00a01.11) were recruited from the Dartmouth community to participate in a two-part neuroimaging study for course credit. Dieting status was assessed by the Restrained Eating Scale ( ;  ), and all participants were prescreened to ensure that they were actively dieting at the time the study was conducted. The study consisted of an initial fMRI scanning session in which brain activity was measured both during an effortful self-control task ( ) and a food cue reactivity task that used naturalistic food stimuli (i.e.,\u00a0fast food commercials;  ). Approximately a week later, participants returned to the lab for a follow-up behavioral session, in which their diets were broken and subsequent disinhibited eating was measured, as per a previously validated diet-breaking procedure ( ;  ;  ). All participants gave informed consent in accordance with guidelines set by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth College, and were fully debriefed at the end of the study (IRB approval #20325). \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nIn order to ensure participants remained na\u00efve to the goals of the experiment, they were instructed that the study was primarily about attention and perception. Specifically, the experimenter told each participant the following: \u201cWe\u2019re interested in the relationship between attention and perception. Specifically, we will be exploring multiple types of perceptual processes, from higher-level person perception to lower-level sensory perception. Today we will be scanning your brain during an attention task, which will be followed by an episode of the popular TV show   Big Bang Theory  , as you would see it on TV with commercials. We are interested in how you perceive these popular TV characters. During the second visit, we\u2019ll have you do some tests of lower level perception involving different senses, such as vision, sight, smell, and taste.\u201d \n\nParticipants first completed an effortful self-control task adapted from Wagner and colleagues\u2019 ( ) study that was modified to be amenable to neuroimaging analysis (i.e.,\u00a0jittered presentation of stimuli and explicit baseline periods were added). For this task, all participants were told that they would watch a clip from a nature documentary featuring Canadian bighorn sheep, and at times various words would appear and move around on the screen, but they were told to \u201cavoid reading these distractor words whenever they appear.\u201d On average, dieters find this task significantly more effortful, compared to a control condition in which they just watched the film and read the words as they pleased, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u00a0=\u00a01.04 (calculated from\u00a0 ). The video lasted for seven minutes, with a jittered presentation of 40 words (all one-syllable and of neutral valence, e.g.,\u00a0\u201cCHAIR\u201d and \u201cBOOK\u201d) throughout the task epoch. \n\nFollowing the effortful self-control task, participants watched a complete episode of the popular television sitcom   The Big Bang Theory  . In between episode segments, participants viewed sets of commercials, with a total of 12 food commercials and 12 non-food (control) commercials that were matched for duration and level of engagement and interest (see Fig.\u00a01 in   for a depiction of the design). \n\nFood commercials featured menu items at popular fast food restaurants, such as McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s, and Kentucky Fried Chicken. In contrast, control commercials featured various products that were not directly consumptive or appetitive (e.g., 4G LTE cellular service, cars, cleaning products, shaving supplies). At the conclusion of the scanning session, we asked participants to report on their experiences of the effortful self-control control task. Specifically, they provided ratings on a 1\u20137 scale in response to questions that asked: \u201cHow difficult did you find this task?\u201d and \u201cHow much did this task \u2018tire you out\u2019 or make you feel mentally exhausted/fatigued afterwards?\u201d \n\nApproximately one week after the scanning session, participants returned to the lab for a follow-up behavioral session, consisting of a commonly used milkshake preload manipulation ( ; designed to temporarily break participants diets;  ;  ;  ) followed by ad libitum, disinhibited eating of ice-cream. After drinking an entire 15-ounce milkshake, participants were instructed to sample three flavors of ice cream under the guise of a taste test. Previous studies have demonstrated that dieters whose diets are broken tend to eat more ice cream, but there are individual differences in amount of ice cream consumed ( ). The total amount (grams) of ice cream consumed was measured using an Ozeri Pro Digital Kitchen Food Scale (Ozeri USA, San Diego, CA). Previous research using this laboratory-based manipulation has consistently demonstrated that following a milkshake preload, dieters will proceed to eat significantly more ice cream than those participants whose diets are not broken (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Analysis of fMRI data \n  \nAll analyses of neuroimaging data were conducted using SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, England), along with tools for batch preprocessing and analysis (available at   First, we carried out standard preprocessing procedures for both inhibitory control and cue reactivity tasks, to account for motion related artifact (by including six motion regressors in first-level GLM model specifications) and increase images\u2019 signal-to-noise ratio via spatial smoothing (8-mm FWHM kernel). Between the two tasks, five participants\u2019 data were excluded due to excessive motion, defined as \u2265 2 instances of \u2265 2 millimeters of movement in the   x  ,\u00a0  y  , or   z   plane (resulting   N  \u00a0=\u00a027 for subsequent analysis). In the case of the main analysis (relating DLPFC activity to subsequent food cue reactivity), there were 26 participants who had complete data across those two measures. So, for those reported analyses,   N  \u00a0=\u00a026. \n\nBrain data for the two tasks were separately modeled and analyzed. First, for the effortful self-control task, we ran a whole-brain univariate GLM analysis at the first (subject) level, with two regressors specifying when words appeared on the screen and when words were absent (i.e., only the film was playing). The main contrast of interest (words present vs. absent) identified period of the task when participants were actively engaging in self-control. Group-level T-maps were then generated using random effects analysis of all subjects\u2019 word present-versus-word absent contrast images. To correct for multiple comparisons, we performed cluster-based correction via the AFNI tool   3dClustSim  , which performed 10,000 simulations using the mean smoothness estimated from residual images (obtained from each participant\u2019s first-level GLM) and using spatial autocorrelation function parameters (via   3dClustSim  \u2019s \u201cacf\u201d option)\u2014as per recent recommendations ( ). These simulations returned a minimum cluster size of 25 voxels at an uncorrected   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.001 threshold required for a cluster-level false positive discovery rate of   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05 (thresholded map available at:  ). \n\nWe first computed the cluster thresholded map from the words-versus-film contrast during the effortful self-control task\u2014indexing brain activity while participants were resisting the urge to read words whenever they appeared on the screen. This map revealed activity in regions of both prefrontal and parietal cortex associated with attention and self-control (see   for thresholded T-map, indicated by orange/yellow gradient;   for a full list of supra-threshold regions of peak activity). To test our hypothesis that lateral prefrontal cortex would be engaged during effortful self-control, we extracted parameter estimates from the cluster in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (peak MNI coordinates   X  \u00a0=\u00a030,   Y  \u00a0=\u00a042,   Z  \u00a0=\u00a024) using a spherical ROI with a 6-millimeter radius. Additionally, given the role the frontoparietal network plays in cognitive control generally, and self-regulation of eating more specifically ( ), we extracted standardized, aggregate activity across eight nodes of the frontoparietal network ( ) and used this system-level activity as an   a priori   brain measure to relate to subsequent food cue activity. \n   Task-elicited brain activity related to effortful self-control, with eight nodes comprising the frontoparietal control network ( ) indicated by black spheres.       Supra-threshold brain regions activated during effortful self-control from the first fMRI task.        \nNext, to estimate activity elicited by food cues when participants were watching commercials, we ran a separate univariate GLM analysis modeling food events (i.e., whenever featured food items appeared on the screen during a food commercial) and control (product) events. Next, contrast images were calculated to compare activity when food events occurred relative to that when control events occurred. Other commercial content (i.e., all time points when products were not featured/visible on the screen) were modeled as baseline. We extracted food cue related activity from these contrast images using independently defined,   a priori   regions/systems of interest, namely: eight nodes of the frontoparietal control network, which supports flexible exertion of self-control ( ;  ); and two regions in the reward system, OFC and bilateral ventral striatum, which reliably activate to appetizing food images (MNI coordinates for OFC: \u221230, 33, \u221218 ; VS: \u00b19, 3, \u22126 (taken from  ). We selected eight nodes in the frontoparietal control network to remain consistent with our prior work showing that aggregate activity across these eight nodes, versus activity in a larger set of frontoparietal nodes, was most predictive of dieters\u2019 self-control success and failure in daily life ( ). However, in order to investigate whether this effect generalizes across a larger set of nodes we used 31 frontoparietal nodes from a recently published parcellation study within our group based on a large, independent sample (  N  \u00a0=\u00a0828;  ) to re-compute regulation\u2013reward balance scores. The findings presented in the main text largely replicated (for more details see Supplementary Materials for all results from this analysis). Food-cue specific activity in both control and reward regions was extracted using a spherical ROI with a 6-millimeter radius. \n\nFor our main analysis, we related task-elicited activity in DLPFC and mean recruitment of the frontoparietal network from the effortful self-control task to the relative recruitment of frontoparietal control network (vs. reward system) during food cue exposure in the second fMRI task. This relative recruitment was captured by regulation\u2013reward balance scores, which were calculated on a subject by subject basis by taking the difference of standardized (i.e.,   Z  -scored), averaged activity in the frontoparietal control network and activity in reward regions (i.e., OFC and bilateral ventral striatum). Higher balance scores represent relatively greater recruitment of the frontoparietal control network, whereas lower balance scores represent relatively greater recruitment of reward regions; this procedure and operationalization of a brain-based balance measure followed that of Lopez and colleagues\u2019 ( ) study. \n\nThe main data file used to run all models and compute all statistics is available at the following repository on the   Open Science Framework  :  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nFirst, as a manipulation check, we examined participants\u2019 ratings of their experience of the first (effortful self-control) task they completed in the scanning session. On average, participants found the task to be difficult, as inferred from a one-sample   t  -test against the scale\u2019s midpoint value of 4,   M  \u00a0=\u00a04.93 (Difference from test value: 0.93, 95% CI for difference: 0.45, 1.40),   SD  \u00a0=\u00a01.21,   t  (26)\u00a0=\u00a03.99,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.001, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u00a0=\u00a00.77; this value was significantly greater than dieters in a control condition from a similar study,   t  (26)\u00a0=\u00a03.09, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u00a0=\u00a00.60,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.005. The self-reported measures of difficulty and tiredness were not correlated with one another,   r  (25)\u00a0=\u00a00.004,   t  \u00a0=\u00a00.02,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.985, so they were entered in as separate covariates in multiple regressions models described below. Next, we observed that across all 8 nodes of the FP network, there was significant activity in the first fMRI task during effortful self-control (i.e., words versus film contrast), mean parameter estimate = 0.159 (95% CI [0.092\u20130.226]), SD = 0.169,   t  (26)\u00a0=\u00a04.89, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u00a0=\u00a00.941,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.001. \n\nTo relate brain activity during effortful self-control to subsequent food cue reactivity, we first calculated the correlation between brain activity in this region and the relative balance of activity in frontoparietal (vs. reward) regions during exposure to food commercials. There was a significant negative association, such that those participants who more readily recruited the DLPFC during the effortful self-control task had lower balance scores when viewing food commercials,   r  (24)\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.574 (95% bootstrapped CI with 10,000 iterations: \u22120.753, \u22120.310),   b  \u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.30,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.002 (see  ). Importantly, this relationship held when controlling for participants\u2019 self-reported difficulty and tiredness when they performed the effortful self-control task, as well as participants\u2019 body mass index (BMI),   b  \u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.538 (95% CI: \u22124.08, \u22121.00),   t  (19)\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a03.445,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.003. In this multiple regression model, neither task difficulty (  b  \u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.021,   t  (19)\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.261,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.797) nor tiredness (  b  \u00a0=\u00a00.042,   t  (19)\u00a0=\u00a00.630,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.536) was associated with balance scores. Additionally, upon examining zero-order correlations, self-reported difficulty was not associated with DLPFC activity during the effortful self-control task (  r  \u00a0=\u00a00.062,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.760) or balance scores during food cue reactivity (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.103,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.615). This was also true for self-reported tiredness, which did not correlate with DLPFC activity (  r  \u00a0=\u00a00.206,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.302) or balance scores (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.003,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.988). \n   Negative association between DLPFC activity during effortful self-control and subsequent frontoparietal (vs. reward) balance scores during exposure to food commercials.    \nNext, consistent with the negative association between DLPFC activity during effortful self-control and balance scores during subsequent exposure to food cues, there was also a significant negative relationship between average recruitment of the frontoparietal network activation during effortful self-control and balance scores in the cue reactivity task,   r  (24)\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.403 (95% bootstrapped CI with 10,000 iterations: \u22120.741, \u22120.032),   b  \u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.302,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.041, and this relationship remained after controlling for self-reported difficulty and tiredness and BMI,   b  \u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.339 (95% CI [\u22120.67, \u22120.01]),   t  (19)\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.168,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.043. Critically, the association between frontoparietal network recruitment during effortful self-control was only observed with balance scores during food cue-exposure. Specifically, there was no relationship between FP network activity during self-control and subsequent FP network activity during cue-reactivity,   r  (24)\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.206,   t  \u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a01.03,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.313, nor was initial FP network recruitment associated with reward system activity during cue reactivity,   r  (24)\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.081,   t  \u00a0=\u00a00.40,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.693. To rule out influences of nuisance variables (e.g., differences in global BOLD signal between individuals) we extracted parameter estimates based on an anatomical mask of the hippocampus (a region not engaged by either task) and found no relationship during the first self-control task and balance scores in the cue reactivity task,   r  (24)\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.09,   t  \u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.444,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.661. \n\nFinally, we examined links between activity in the effortful self-control/cue reactivity tasks and ad libitum ice-cream eating from the behavioral session. On average, participants consumed 71.1 grams of ice-cream (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a040.8, range: 9\u2013158 grams), and there was a positive (albeit non-significant) correlation between recruitment of DLPFC during effortful self-control and grams of ice-cream consumed,   r  (24)\u00a0=\u00a00.319,   t  \u00a0=\u00a01.647,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.112. There was also a negative, non-significant relationship between balance scores and grams of ice-cream consumed,   r  (24)\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.309,   t  \u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a01.594,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.124. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nResults from this study indicated that individual differences in chronic dieters\u2019 recruitment of brain regions associated with cognitive control (i.e., DLPFC and frontoparietal network) while performing an effortful self-control task was subsequently associated with the balance of activity between brain regions implicated in self-control and reward during exposure to food commercials. Consistent with our hypothesis, greater recruitment of DLPFC\u2014as well as the frontoparietal network as a whole\u2014during effortful self-control was associated with less recruitment of the frontoparietal network and more reward related activity whenever food items appeared on the screen in the cue reactivity task. This suggests that more (or less) brain activity during an initial task requiring self-control exertion may serve to characterize the different response profiles that dieters may show when exposed to appetitive food cues. \n\nNotably, we only observed a significant, negative relationship between FP recruitment during effortful self-control and subsequent balance scores during exposure to food commercials. There was no such relationship between control-related FP recruitment in the first task and activity in either FP or reward systems, respectively, during food cue reactivity (second task). This is consistent with theorizing that suggests taking both impulsive and inhibitory processes into account to characterize self-control outcomes ( ;  ;  ), as well as recent evidence showing that the relative balance of control (versus reward) activity was predictive of self-regulation outcomes\u2014whereas activity in either system alone was not ( ). \n\nThe present findings also substantiate and extend previous studies that have shown that when participants are engaged in effortful self-control tasks they subsequently show   reduced   brain activity in lateral prefrontal cortex when performing cognitive tasks ( ; e.g.,  ). For example, in a study by Friese and colleagues (2013), those participants who were randomly assigned to suppress their emotions when viewing highly distressing, negatively-valenced stimuli showed reduced recruitment of lateral prefrontal cortex during a subsequent Stroop task, compared to those participants in the control condition ( ). However, one of the features that differentiates our study from previous work is that we focused on dieters\u2019 neural responses to appetitive food cues, following previous self-control exertion. This approach has the advantage of looking at a motivationally relevant class of stimuli in a population that, by definition, is chronically engaged in self-regulation and inherently motivated to regulate their responses. However, we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge that it remains an open question as to whether the effect of prior self-control exertion on neural responses to food cues reflects either: (1) a reduction in self-control capacity, as a resource-based account would predict (e.g.,  ); or (2) the fact the those participants who experience the task as more effortful are simply less motivated to continue regulating in a secondary task, as per motivation-based accounts (e.g.,  ).Without additional measures, the present study cannot disentangle these two views (see above, with associated references, for the most recent theorizing and findings related to potential mechanisms underlying self-control fatigue and lapses). \n\nIn addition, we examined the relationship between these neural measures and ad libitum eating of ice cream following a diet breaking episode in a separate experiment. Although the relationships were in the expected direction (i.e., greater grams of ice cream eaten among participants who, on average, showed more FP recruitment during effortful self-control and also lower balance scores), the overall correlations with neural measures were not significant. Whether this reflects a true null effect, or instead that the mechanisms underlying individual differences in neural activity we observed following self-control exertion do not translate to disinhibited eating following a diet breaking episode, remains an open question. \n\nThere are several strengths to our study design and approach. First, our overall analysis approach\u2014linking brain activity from an effortful self-control task to activity in a subsequent task that   also   calls for spontaneous regulation of prepotent responses\u2014is arguably more ecologically valid than previous studies that have examined effortful self-control. Although speculative, we would argue that the sequence and nature of the two self-control tasks used here (i.e., an intensive, initial exertion of effort to inhibit, followed by unpredictable (but no less needed) instances that also require self-control) may mimic dieters\u2019 experiences in daily life. For example, a dieter might exert self-control to block out distraction during an intense time of study or work. And, the extent to which they find this sustained inhibition taxing, they may have little self-control capacity to call upon when they are suddenly faced with a dessert tray at a restaurant later that day. \n\nSecond, the current study\u2019s design may reliably identify those individuals who experience more (or less) success adhering to their dieting goals. For example, a dieter who more readily recruits certain cognitive control regions (i.e., DLPFC) during an effortful self-control task may be actively maintaining the task set (i.e., \u201cavoid reading the words\u201d), but such task engagement may be more cognitively demanding and render the frontoparietal network less able to exert control over the reward system during future exposure to food cues (cf.  ). Indeed, the effects observed here in the appetitive domain are consistent with other studies that have showed reductions in activity in prefrontal cortex\u2014and accompanying task deficits in various cognitive tasks\u2014following self-control exertion ( ;  ; e.g.,  ). The present findings are also consistent with predictions made by models emphasizing the role of self-regulatory fatigue in affecting self-control outcomes ( ;  ;  ), and those that highlight the limitations of cognitive control processes more broadly ( ). \n\nAdditionally, if it is true that greater recruitment of brain regions during an effortful self-control task can undermine future self-control attempts, then it means that more control-related activity (during initial exertion) is not necessarily conducive to dieters\u2019 self-regulatory goals. Indeed, and consistent with prior behavioral work on limited self-regulatory capacity (e.g.,  ), control-related activity during self-control exertion may reflect task difficulty or effort, potentially leading to fatigue and dieters\u2019 inability to later recruit self-control regions when faced with (subsequent) appetitive temptations. But, since participants\u2019 self-reported difficulty/fatigue ratings did not correlate with brain activity during effortful self-control, or with the frontoparietal (vs. reward) balance measure, it is possible that dieters do not have conscious awareness or insight into how much they are affected by exertions of self-control (or not). Future work may consider improving dieters\u2019 self-awareness about their susceptibility, neural or otherwise, to improve adherence to self-regulatory goals over time. Indeed, others have made similar arguments about targeting people\u2019s self-awareness and insight in the context treatments for drug addiction ( ). \n\nDespite the implications discussed thus far, the current study has some limitations that are worth mentioning. First, the self-control task we administered was somewhat short in length (i.e., 7\u00a0min), so it is not clear how long effects of effortful self-control on cue reactivity might persist. Second, even though our participants gave ratings of difficulty and fatigue during the effortful self-control task, we did not have an independent measure of participants\u2019 objective performance on the task (i.e., how successful they were in avoiding reading the words on the screen). A future study would benefit from incorporating eye-tracking or another validation measure to calculate, on a subject-by-subject basis, successful inhibition of the impulse to read the words. And even though we used a validated diet-breaking procedure for the behavioral session, using a self-control exertion task would have led to more construct validity and may help explain why we did not find a relationship between the brain data and overeating after the milkshake preload. \n\nWe should also note that, in comparison to behavioral work, the sample size was relatively small and thus was not powered for the detection of moderate correlations. This may place a limit on our ability to detect small to moderate effects of self-control exertion (e.g., we did not observe any relationship between brain activity and ice-cream eating). Although to remain consistent with prior work, with recruitment necessarily constrained to female dieters, future work would benefit from either expanding beyond this population in order to increase sample sizes and test generalizability to other populations. \n\nAnother possibility is that our sample, on average, showed relatively little ice cream consumption (mean = 71.1 grams), as well as a more restricted range (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a040.8 grams) compared to previous studies that also measured disinhibited ice-cream eating in dieters (cf. mean values of 71.7\u2013211.2 grams and   SD   values of 57.4\u2013123.8 in ( ). Also, in order to establish equivalent levels of motivations to regulate eating, we only recruited from the dieting population. So, the boundary conditions and generalizability of this effect need to be tested in other populations, as it is probable that the nature of self-regulatory goals and other related factors may modulate patterns of brain activity during effortful self-control (and subsequent food cue reactivity). Lastly, one overall caveat to the present work is that all reported findings are correlational, so no strong claims can be made as far as the directionality of the observed effects. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nTo conclude, we probed the neural mechanisms of repeated self-control exertion among dieters, using a reasonably naturalistic dual-task paradigm that coupled an initial, effortful self-control task with subsequent exposure to appetitive food cues as presented in real-world food commercials. We extended past work, which took a brain-as-predictor approach ( ) using the balance between prefrontal and reward related responses during food cue exposure to predict dietary failure ( ), by using this same measure to examine how prior exertion of self-control may lead to impaired dietary self-control during exposure to tempting food cues. In doing so, we tried to adopt a health neuroscience framework, a primary aim of which is to better characterize health risk behaviors\u2014including patterns of over-eating that lead to obesity\u2014in order to alleviate the various burdens, medical and otherwise, associated with preventable chronic disease ( ). Future intervention studies and clinical trials may benefit from taking a similar approach and target such brain-based risk factor, with the goal of modulating brain responses during effortful self-control and cue reactivity, and possibly producing changes in real world eating behaviors. \n\n\n##  Supplemental Information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6397754, "text_md5": "9b455e8445fbd898628c75c87a4fede0", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 62], "journal": [63, 68], "publication_year": [70, 74], "title": [85, 285], "keywords": [299, 365], "abstract": [378, 1890], "body": [1899, 38890]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 30842910, "doi": "10.7717/peerj.6550", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6397754", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6397754"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6397754\">6397754</a>", "list_title": "PMC6397754  Recruitment of cognitive control regions during effortful self-control is associated with altered brain activity in control and reward systems in dieters during subsequent exposure to food commercials"}
