In medicine, researchers take a certain point that the brain is the control center of CSU, but in previous experiments, the researchers found that cerebellum also had a certain effect on CSU. In order to find out the influence of CSU in the brain and cerebellum, we collected the brain resting-state fMRI data from 40 healthy controls and 32 CSU patients and used DPABI to preprocess. We calculated the entropy values of five scales by using multiscale entropy (MSE) and the average entropy values of two groups' BOLD signals; 15 regions with significant differences were found which not only had a more detailed impact in the brain but also had an impact in the cerebellum, such as precentral gyrus, lenticular putamen, and vermis of cerebellum. In addition, we found that compared with the healthy controls, the entropy values of CSU patients showed two trends which need further study. The advantage of our experiment is that the multiscale entropy value is used to get more influence regions of CSU in the brain and cerebellum. The results of this paper may provide some help for the pathological study of CSU. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a disease, characterized by recurrent (<24\u2009h) pruritic wheal of skin and mucous membranes, with a duration of more than 6 weeks, and spontaneous, temporary, and itchy recurrent episodes that occur several times a day to several days [ ]. Studies have shown that CSU can have a significant impact on the lives of patients, including daily work and mental health [ ,  ]. According to the statistical population, the prevalence of CSU is about 0.5%-1% [ ]. In view of the similar allergic reactions in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria, in most cases, the triggering factor cannot be determined. There are several theories of pathogenesis, but there is no reliable theoretical proof [ ]. Because the pathogenesis of CSU is not clear, the current treatment options are limited [ ]. Before 2014, antihistamines were the only approved drugs by CSU, and 50% of patients still have symptoms after treatment [ ]. \n\nThe clinical manifestations of CSU are pruritus [ ], which sends signals to the brain through the spinal cord [ ], and the brain is the control center for pruritus. The pathogenesis of CSU is complex and unclear. From a systemic perspective, complexity reflects the brain's ability to adapt to environmental change, which can be compromised in CSU, leading to abnormal skin itching, which may patients with impaired mental function [ ]. Therefore, studying the complexity of brain activity may provide advice on how CSU correlates with the pathophysiology of brain function. According to the study, the BOLD signals measured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is the hemodynamic response of a large number of nerve cells [ ], which is the best tool for us to understand the brain. In recent decades, studies have analyzed the functional connectivity data of different brain regions to obtain local connectivity of brain regions and spontaneous local brain activity characteristics [ ], such as seed-based resting state functional connectivity [ ] and Regional homogeneity (ReHo) [ ]. ReHo can be used to describe the local consistency of time series of adjacent voxels in a region. Studies have used such methods to explore different ways of connecting different brain regions or networks to help locate brain regions associated with related diseases [ \u2013 ]. Wang et al. used ReHo to explore the brain regions associated with itching [ ]. Yang et al. understand the brain function of patients by comparing the characteristics and differences of low-frequency amplitude (ALFF) [ ] in the brain region at rest status. However, the current link between CSU and the complexity of brain activity remains unrecognized. \n\nMultiscale entropy (MSE) [ ] is a method for data with nonstationary and nonlinear features and is widely used in sample complexity calculations. MSE provides the characteristics of entropy across multiple time scales, so that the complexity of the physiological signals not included in the traditional method can be extracted to assess the complexity of the time series of the diseased and healthy groups [ ]. MSE has the following advantages: (1) The required length of data is shorter, and the amount of calculation is smaller. (2) The ability to resist noise and anti-interference is better. (3) At a multiscale, a new sequence is constructed based on a given physiological signal sequence, and the analysis is more systematic. Based on the above advantages, multiscale entropy has been used more and more in the field of biomedical signal processing [ ]. Many studies have been using MSE to quantify the complexity and regularity of BOLD signals [ \u2013 ], such as using the MSE method to analyze the complexity of electroencephalogram (EGG) in patients with Alzheimer's disease and inferring the possibility of MSE from the findings. It is a useful tool for checking the complexity of EEG [ ]. Azami et al. found that MSE analysis of EEG signals helped distinguish patients with Alzheimer's disease and healthy individuals and demonstrated the ability of MSE to characterize brain signal complexity in different bands of Alzheimer's disease [ ]. Literature 22 points out that under the same conditions, the AUC value of MSE (AUC = 0.76) is higher than that of HRVI (AUC = 0.70) [ ]. Jun and Qian-Li first studied the multiscale entropy of the ST segment of ECG. Studies have shown that average MSE values and fluctuations in range of variation may be more effective in revealing heart health [ ]. \n\nNumerous studies have shown that MSE plays a very significant role in studying the relationship between physiological signals and brain function [ ,  ,  ]. In this study, we used MSE to explore the correlation of brain activity between CSU and HCs. We hypothesized that CSU is associated with reduced complexity of multiple time scales. In addition, we study the entropy distribution of BOLD signals in CSU patients and explore the relationship between resting-state brain activity complexity and associated CSU pathology. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Data Collection and Preprocessing \n  \nThe research protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Guang'anmen Hospital of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Experiment agrees with the approved guidelines. All subjects signed written informed consent before the study began. The study participants consisted of 72 Han Chinese participants who were recruited from the dermatology clinic at Guang'anmen Hospital in Beijing. There are 40 healthy subjects (8 males and 32 females, age 25-63), and the affected group consisted of 32 patients with chronic urticaria (6 males and 26 females, age 25-65), characterized by a temporary, itchy, unclear itching of 6 weeks or longer. All patients discontinued antihistamine drugs (such as loratadine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, and cetirizine dihydrochloride) and interventions 3 days prior to the scan. During the scan, the patient did not have any itching [ ], UAS > 14, and age and gender match. Demographic and clinical data for participants are as shown in  . \n\n\n### 2.2. Description of Machine Parameters in Functional Magnetic Resonance Scanning \n  \nDuring the experiment, the fMRI scan was performed on a 3.0T Siemens MAGNETOM Skyra MRI system equipped with a 20-channel head coil. All functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments were performed in the morning. Foam pads were used to limit head movement. T2 weighted images to rule out lesions and abnormalities. A high-resolution T1 weighted structure image is obtained by using a three-dimensional fast gradient echo sequence with a repetition time (TR = 5000\u2009ms), an echo time (TE = 2.98\u2009ms), a field of view (FOV = 256 \u00d7 240\u2009mm ), and a flip angle (FA = 4\u00b0). The matrix size is 256 \u00d7 256; the slice thickness is 1\u2009mm; the gap is 0\u2009mm, a total of 176 pieces. Using a 43-layer gradient echo plane imaging EPI sequence (TR = 2500\u2009ms, TE = 30\u2009ms, matrix 70 \u00d7 70, FOV 210 \u00d7 210\u2009mm , FA = 90\u00b0), slice thickness 3\u2009mm, gap 0\u2009mm, and collection covering the entire brain, the fMRI image is sliced parallel to the AC-PC line. The scan time was 369 seconds (the first 9 seconds of the virtual scan), and the subjects were asked to close their eyes [ ]. \n\n\n### 2.3. Data Preprocessing \n  \nThe stationary state fMRI image was preprocessed using the data processing assistant DPABI for the stationary state fMRI toolbox implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Preprocessing includes as follows:\n   \n Slice Timing  . In the process of fMRI acquisition, since it takes several seconds to collect a whole brain image (i.e., TR = 2.5\u2009s), the image level of the brain is not collected at the same time. In this experiment, there are 43 layers of images in the whole brain. Therefore, the time required to collect one layer is about 0.058\u2009s, and the collection method is compartmental collection, that is, first collect 1, 3, 5, 7,\u2026, 43 layers, and then collect 2, 4, 6,\u2026, 42 layers, so the acquisition between different layers will produce a time difference. The principle of time layer correction is to normalize all layers of the whole brain to the same layer through data processing (usually in the middle layer, layer 43rd); after this processing, the data is easier to study later \n  \n Realign  . The purpose of MRI is to scan and image the structural images in the brain, so the subject's subtle head movements will have a great impact on the scan results, and it is impossible to keep the head completely motionless. In this data collection, the head movement tolerance of the subject is less than 2\u2009mm, and the rotation is less than 2 degrees. If the subject is more than 2\u2009mm or rotated more than three millimeters in any direction in a three-dimensional space, it is not allowed \n  \n Standardize into the Standard Stereotactic Space of the Montreal Institute of Neurology (MNI) EPI Template and Then Resample to  3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3\u2009  mm  Voxels  . Because of the high and low body weight of other subjects or other reasons, each person's brain size is different, but the human brain structure and its structural positional relationship are unified, so all subjects can be transformed. Get unified. Realigning and normalizing to the MNI space facilitates the study of brain structures and increases the universality of experimental results \n  \n Smooth  . Although the purpose of the previous step is to eliminate the effects of different brains, there will be a slight deficiency. The subtle errors are not guaranteed to be completely eliminated. Therefore, after standardization, we will perform another smoothing process. The main purpose is to make each voxel and its surrounding voxels smoother \n  \n Filter  . Using bandpass time filtering (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz) to minimize noise. This step can attenuate the noise frequency and improve the signal-to-noise ratio \n  \n\nDue to the instability of the initial fMRI scan, the first 10 data points of each BOLD signals are discarded; therefore, the remaining 134 data points per time series are used for analysis. \n\n\n### 2.4. Multiscale Entropy Algorithm \n  \n#### 2.4.1. Sample Entropy Algorithm \n  \nSample entropy is a kind of entropy commonly used by researchers in the field of physiological signals research in recent years. The advantages are (1) sample entropy can be well applied to shorter time series. (2) The sample entropy is robust to noise. (3) For random time series, the sample entropy has good consistency [ ]. Therefore, in this section, we briefly introduce multiscale entropy based on sample entropy. The principle of sample entropy is to measure the complexity of data by using the self-similarity of time series. The basic algorithm flow is as follows: Let the original time series   x  (1),   x  (2), \u22ef,   x  (  N  ) have   N   data points.    \nA set of   m  -dimension vectors in sequential order of serial numbers: \n    \n(2) Define the distance between   X  (  i  ) and   X  (  j  ) as the largest difference between the corresponding elements in the two vectors. The formula is expressed as: \n  \n\nCalculate the distance between the vector   X  (  i  ) and the rest of the vector   X  (  j  ).    \n(3) Give a threshold   r  , for each   i   calculate the number of dist[  X  (  i  ),   X  (  j  )] <   r   as   B  , get the ratio of this number to the total number of distances: \n    \n(4) Average for all   C  (  r  ): \n    \n(5) Let   m   =   m   + 1, repeat steps 1\u2009~\u20094, get   C  (  r  ): \n  \n(6) The sample entropy sequence is: \n  \n\n\n#### 2.4.2. Multiscale Entropy Algorithm \n  \nDue to the nonlinearity of the BOLD signals, the single-scale entropy cannot fully measure its complexity. Therefore, we need to measure its complexity on multiple scales [ ,  ], and multiscale can be understood as magnifying glass magnification. Multiple different scales will see different characteristics of the signals. The basic entropy algorithm of multiscale entropy uses sample entropy. Experiments have shown that the sample entropy is more suitable for short-time time series, that is, the signal length does not affect the entropy result [ ]. The multiscale entropy algorithm consists of two steps: (1) coarse granulation process, that is, multiscale transformation of the original time series; (2) substituting the coarsely granulated new time series into the sample entropy calculation. In order to obtain a coarse-grained time series with a scale factor of 1, first, the original sequence is divided into   \u03c4   nonuniform time windows, and the   k  -th coarse-grained time series is defined as follows:\n \n\nWhen the scale factor is 1, the multiscale entropy after the coarse-grained sequence is the original sample entropy:\n \n\nWhen the scale factor is   \u03c4  , the length of the sequence after coarse granulation is   N  /  \u03c4   of the original time series. \n\nWe can summarize the basic algorithm flow of multiscale entropy: (a) construct a coarse-grained time series according to different scale factors, (b) quantify the sample entropy of each coarse-grained time series, and (c) check the sample entropy within a certain range distribution and statistical results. \n\nWe generally require the length of the time series to be 10  ~ 30 . In this experiment, since the original time series is short, we choose the parameter values as   m   = 1,   r   = 0.35  SD  ,   \u03c4   = 5 of the MSE [ ,  ]. We use the AAL template in the DPABI toolkit to divide the brain into 116 brain regions for complexity analysis. In addition, we standardize the BOLD signals to avoid noise and outlier interference before performing MSE analysis. For the generated entropy values, we combined the statistical method, the general linear model to more scientifically compare the differences between the CSU patients and the healthy controls. \n\n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Clinical Outcome \n  \nAnalysis of personal information on 32 CSU patients and 40 healthy controls showed no physiological correlation. The patient did not undergo therapeutic intervention, and UAS7 remained at a level of 30.8 \u00b1 6.2. \n\n#### 3.1.1. Comparative Results Display Analysis Based on ALFF (Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuation) \n  \nThe comparison results are generated using the ALFF values of the brain. We use the Student's   t  -test to statistically analyze the ALFF values of healthy controls and CSU patients and then use the Brain View of DPABI to display it.   shows the comparison of the outer side of the cerebral hemisphere, and it can be seen that compared with healthy people, the patient's ALFF values has changed in this place. The following figure shows the comparison of the inner and lateral sides of the cerebral hemisphere. It is obvious that the patient has a significant increase in ALFF values at the position of the lenticular putamen. In order to confirm that all the changed brain regions are related to urticaria, we conducted further multiscale entropy experiments. \n\n\n\n### 3.2. Multiscale Entropy Analysis Results Based on BOLD Signals \n  \nIn order to further explore the parts of the brain that show differences in the above analysis and find out which areas are associated with pruritus by extracting BOLD signals from the healthy controls and the CSU patients. Time series refer to physiological signals displayed by each brain region at each acquisition time. The multiscale entropy analysis is performed on the BOLD signals, and then, the following two different statistical analysis comparisons are performed on the multiscale entropy results. \n\n#### 3.2.1. Multiscale Entropy Analysis Results Using General Linear Models (GLM) \n  \nMultiscale entropy was used to perform a GLM test. In the brain, the R precentral gyrus, L superior frontal gyrus, R orbital superior frontal gyrus, L middle frontal gyrus, R middle frontal gyrus, R orbital middle frontal gyrus, R supplementary motor area, L postcentral gyrus, L angular gyrus, L paracentral lobule gyrus, R lenticular putamen, and L superior temporal gyrus have   p   < 0.05, so they have statistical significance. In the cerebellum, the L superior cerebellum, the R superior cerebellum, and the vermis of cerebellum have   p   < 0.05, so they have statistical significance ( ). \n\n\n#### 3.2.2. Analysis Results with Different Scale Comparison \n  \nThe multiscale entropy of the same brain region in the healthy controls and CSU patients was analyzed and found. There were two trends in the change of the entropy values between the CSU patients and the healthy controls: (1) The entropy of healthy controls at five scales is always higher than that of CSU patients; (2) The entropy value of CSU patients at five scales is higher than that of the healthy controls at the same scale ( ). \n\n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we investigated changes in ALFF values in patients with chronic urticaria compared to healthy controls. We obtained the consistent conclusion as Yuming Wang [ ] by using the Student's   t  -test: the patient showed a significant increase in ALFF values in the lenticular putamen. Similarly, it is difficult to get other more detailed significant areas. To get more accurate results, the multiscale entropy is chosen to measure the complexity of the nonlinear BOLD signals. \n\nThe clinical manifestations of CSU are pruritus or tingling of the skin. Itching is a physiologically pleasing behavior that is related to the intensity of itching [ ,  ]. This pleasant experience is controlled by an active brain area and will show a sense of pleasure even without scratching. In previous studies [ ], these areas were considered to be activated: the R precentral gyrus, L superior frontal gyrus, R supplementary motor area, L postcentral gyrus, L angular gyrus, R orbital superior frontal gyrus, R orbital middle frontal gyrus, lenticular putamen, and the L superior temporal gyrus. The precentral gyrus is the location of the primary motor cortex, which is the main area of the motor system and works in conjunction with other brain regions to plan and perform scratching movements. Studies show that primary somatosensory cortex is related to itching [ ]. The postcentral gyrus is the somatosensory area of the human body. Studies have shown that the primary somatosensory area is related to pruritus management [ ]. According to previous studies, with functions of memory, judgment, analysis, thinking, and operation of the prefrontal lobe [ ], R lenticular putamen [ ] and L superior temporal gyrus [ ] are related to itching. According to research, the sensitivity of peripheral and central neurons to pain and pruritus has shown striking similarities [ ]. The angular gyrus is a visual language center, which is related to the cognitive function network and affects the pain matrix [ ]. Therefore, we speculate that the angular gyrus is related to itching. \n\nIn this study, we found that CSU is associated with the L middle frontal gyrus and R middle frontal gyrus, showing a reduction in complexity. The middle frontal gyrus is one of the components of prefrontal lobe and plays a vital role in cognitive function. Previous research has also shown that the middle frontal gyrus may involve psychological responses such as sensory-resolved processing, emotional response, motor planning, and cognitive evaluation [ ]. Thereby achieving advanced central treatment of pruritus. CSU may be related to the reduced complexity of the paracentral lobule gyrus [ ]and the activity of the brain regions of the vermis of cerebellum [ ]. The central lobular lobe belongs to the first somatic motor area and is closely related to the action of pruritus and scraping. Studies have shown that the vermis of cerebellum are associated with pain [ ], while many interactions between itching and pain in the process of transmission and sensitization, the pain caused by scratching will reduce itching, and vice versa [ ]. From this, we suspect that the vermis of cerebellum are related to itching. We also found that the complexity of the L superior cerebellum and R superior cerebellum was increased in patients. The cerebellum is an important regulatory center of movement, and there are a large number of afferent and efferent connections. Neuroanatomical studies showed that the cerebellum sends projections to the cortical sensory motor area and reward region via the thalamus, which indicates that the cerebellum may participate in the neuropathological process of CSU [ ]. \n\nIn addition, we investigated the differences in the complexity of brain activity between CSU patients and healthy controls for brain areas with significant entropy values. We plotted MSE curves on five scales and found the following two cases: one is that the entropy value of the healthy controls is greater than the entropy values of the CSU patients on each scale, such as R precentral gyrus, L superior frontal gyrus, R middle frontal gyrus, R middle frontal gyrus orbital part, R supplementary motor area, L postcentral gyrus, L angular gyrus, paracentral lobule, and vermis of cerebellum. We can conclude that in the above brain regions, the complexity of the BOLD signals in the healthy controls is higher than the complexity of the BOLD signals in the CSU patients. Another case showed that the MSE values of the CSU patients in superior frontal orbital part, lenticular nucleus putamen, superior temporal gyrus, and superior cerebellum were higher than that of the healthy controls on all scales. The orbital frontal gyrus participates in the prefrontal cortex's integration function, which is related to advanced activities such as thinking. And some studies have shown that the prefrontal lobe plays a major role in the perception and expectation of pain [ ]. The lenticular nucleus, as part of the striatum, is related to the emotional processing of painful stimulation and is also a brain region related to reward [ ]. The superior temporal gyrus is related to memory function, but there is also relevant literature indicating that the temporal lobe can be deactivated when it is stimulated by related pain [ ]. These three brain regions may be involved in the perceptual processing of painful stimuli caused by itching, which in turn can activate them. These findings may provide valuable insights into the neuropathology of chronic urticaria. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusion \n  \nUsing multiscale entropy analysis, we assessed the abnormalities of resting brain activity in patients with pruritus and their pathological relationship with disease. Our findings represent a new perspective on functional brain activity in pruritus. At the same time, we have also found that parts of the cerebellum also have an effect on pruritus, which enhances the understanding of various pathophysiological processes in pruritus. Further, the use of entropy analysis in the time dimension can facilitate clinical disease imaging markers. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nVariables\tCSU (n = 32)\tCSU (n = 32)\tHC (n = 40)\tHC (n = 40)\nVariables\tMean\tSD\tMean\tSD\nAge\t47.25\t11.88\t43.35\t11.11\nGender, female\t26.0\t81.25%\t32.0\t80%\nHandedness, right\t\t100%\t\t100%\nUAS7\t30.8\t6.2\t\t\n### Caption\nDemographics and clinical characteristics.\n### Footer\nCategorical data are given as number (%).\n\n\n## ID: tab2\n### Label: Table 2\nBrain regions\tMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tF value\tp value\nBrain regions\tX\tY\tZ\tF value\tp value\nR precentral gyrus\t40.37\t-8.21\t52.09\t29.895\t0.005\nL superior frontal gyrus\t-19.45\t34.81\t42.2\t19.33\t0.012\nR orbital superior frontal gyrus\t17.49\t48.1\t-14.02\t25.257\t0.007\nL middle frontal gyrus\t-34.43\t32.73\t35.46\t10.804\t0.03\nR middle frontal gyrus\t36.59\t33.06\t34.04\t10.566\t0.031\nR orbital middle frontal gyrus\t32.18\t52.59\t-10.73\t17.302\t0.014\nR supplementary motor area\t7.62\t0.17\t61.85\t13.996\t0.02\nL postcentral gyrus\t-43.46\t-22.63\t48.91\t11.0\t0.029\nL angular gyrus\t-45.14\t-60.82\t35.59\t12.034\t0.026\nL paracentral lobule gyrus\t-8.63\t-25.36\t70.07\t8.299\t0.045\nR lenticular putamen\t26.78\t4.91\t2.46\t8.331\t0.045\nL superior temporal gyrus\t-54.16\t-20.68\t7.13\t38.042\t0.004\nL superior cerebellum\t-10.95\t-48.95\t-45.9\t9.193\t0.039\nR superior cerebellum\t9.46\t-49.5\t-46.33\t11.496\t0.028\nVermis of cerebellum\t1.15\t-64.43\t-34.08\t8.087\t0.047\n### Caption\nRegions showing significant changes in the MSE complexity profiles of BOLD signals from patients with CSU.\n### Footer\nAll brain clusters have p < 0.05 corrected for GLM. aL: left; R: right. b(x, y, z) was the coordinate of each brain region. cVolume was computed from cluster size (3\u22173\u22173\u2009mm3 voxel).\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8172304, "text_md5": "c055c0dfba4f07c12105e3b8ee016be4", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 169], "journal": [170, 193], "publication_year": [195, 199], "title": [210, 297], "keywords": [311, 311], "abstract": [324, 1546], "body": [1555, 24377], "tables": [24390, 26002]}, "batch": 5, "pmid": 34122619, "doi": "10.1155/2021/6691356", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8172304", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8172304"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8172304\">8172304</a>", "list_title": "PMC8172304  Research on Characteristic of Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Based on Multiscale Entropy"}

Our results showed that the children with TS exhibited significantly decreased ALFF in the posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus and bilateral parietal gyrus. fALFF was decreased in TS children in the anterior cingulated cortex, bilateral middle and superior frontal cortices and superior parietal lobule, and increased in the left putamen and bilateral thalamus. Moreover, we found significantly positive correlations between fALFF and tic severity scores in the right thalamus. Our study provides empirical evidence for abnormal spontaneous neuronal activity in TS patients, which may implicate the underlying neurophysiological mechanism in TS and demonstrate the possibility of applying ALFF/fALFF for clinical TS studies. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nTourette syndrome (TS) is a childhood-onset chronic disorder characterized by the presence of involuntary, multiple movements and vocalizations called \u201ctics\u201d which last for more than one year. TS is a common disorder with prevalence in between 0.05 and 3% ( ) and could cause impairments such as distress, interference with activities, social impact, occupational difficulty, and occasional physical morbidity ( ). \n\n proposed a model of dysfunction of the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit in TS, hypothesizing that aberrant activity in the striatum will release the thalamus from inhibition, and the thalamus will excite the cortex to the execution of unwanted movements (tics). Evidence for abnormalities in subcortical and cortical regions within the CSTC circuits has been derived from structural and functional neuroimaging studies in TS (for a review, see  ). Structural imaging studies have revealed consistent findings of reduced volume in children and adults with TS in striatal areas, particularly the caudate nucleus ( ,  ;  ;  ), with a smaller caudate volume in childhood would lead to higher symptom severity later in life ( ). Cortical thinning in sensorimotor cortices has been found in children and adults with TS, with a negative relationship to tic severity ( ;  ;  ). Functional imaging studies have revealed increased activity in the supplementary motor area (SMA) prior to tics ( ;  ), which has been suggested as reflecting the premonitory urge that precedes tics, and might give rise to the aberrant striatal activity, which has been demonstrated in positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission tomography (SPET) studies to be increasing along with blood flow in TS subjects during tic release ( ). Moreover, a previous study has found aberrant activity in regions within the cognitive control network ( ), expanding the functional anatomy of putative abnormalities in TS from the CSTC circuit to other cortical networks that support cognitive functions. \n\nHowever, most results from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are generally inconsistent, which could be due to the heterogeneities in sample and task across studies ( ). Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), first proposed by  , measures the physiologically meaningful spontaneous low-frequency (typically 0.01\u20130.1 Hz) fluctuations (LFFs), providing opportunities to investigate the baseline brain activity free of task differences. With the advantages of easy application (compared to conventional task-driven paradigms), rs-fMRI has been widely applied to study brain function under normal and pathological conditions ( ;  ). However, as far as we know, there are very few fMRI studies investigating the TS-related alterations in baseline brain activity that could help us to understand the underlying pathophysiological characteristics of TS ( ). \n\nAmplitude of LFF (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) measure the ALFF of the fMRI signal and have been used to characterize the regional spontaneous neuronal activity ( ;  ). ALFF is defined as total power within the low-frequency range, typically 0.01\u20130.1 Hz ( ), whereas fALFF measures the power within the low-frequency range divided by the total power in the entire detectable frequency range ( ). ALFF has higher test\u2013retest reliability in gray matter regions than fALFF, while fALFF is more specific than ALFF and is more effective at minimizing artifactual contributions of cardiac and respiratory ( ). Both ALFF and fALFF have been successfully applied to detect the abnormal spontaneous brain activity of various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI;  ), bipolar depression ( ), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD;  ), schizophrenia ( ), and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy ( ). Aberrant ALFF/fALFF have also been found in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD;  ;  ) and obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD;  ), which are two common comorbid disorders of TS. \n\nIn this study, we computed ALFF and fALFF from rs-fMRI data to investigate the alterations in spontaneous brain activities in children with TS compared with demographically matched healthy children. We sought to determine (i) whether the children with TS show abnormal ALFF/fALFF, and (ii) whether the ALFF/fALFF abnormalities correlate with their tic severity scores. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### SUBJECTS \n  \nTourette syndrome subjects were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Beijing Anding Hospital, Capital Medical University, China. Twenty TS subjects who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) criteria ( ) and 17 demographically matched healthy control children were enrolled in this study. The inclusion criteria for the TS group included right-handedness, treatment na\u00efve and no other psychiatric diagnosis. Exclusion criteria for the control group included a lifetime history of tic disorder, OCD, ADHD, or a current DSM-IV Axis 1 disorder. Additional exclusion criteria for both groups were epilepsy, head trauma with loss of consciousness, former or present substance abuse, or an IQ below 70, as measured with the full scale Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Chinese Children-Revised (WISCC-R;  ). All patients had normal neurological examinations except for their tics and were also evaluated with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) to assess for possible comorbid psychiatric disorders. Tic severity was quantified using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS;  ). All patients provided written informed consent for their participation in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from the next of kin, caretakers, or guardians on the behalf of the minors/children participants involved in this study. Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics of Beijing Anding Hospital, Capital Medical University, approved the study. \n\n\n### DATA ACQUISITION \n  \nMagnetic resonance imaging data were acquired on a 3.0 T SIEMENS TRIO scanner in the 306 hospital of the people\u2019s liberation army of China. Participants were encouraged to minimize movements throughout the scan. Each Participant lay supine with the head snugly fixed by a belt and foam pads. In order to enhance participants\u2019 abilities to maintain head position, a thermoplastic mask that molds to an individual\u2019s face and attaches to the head coil was applied. Headphones dampened scanner noise and enabled communication with participants. High resolution anatomical images were obtained using 3D magnetization prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) T1-weighted sequence with 176 sagittal slices, repetition time (TR) of 2530 ms, echo time (TE) of 3.39 ms, flip angle (FA) of 7\u00b0, voxel size of 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm. Resting-state functional images were acquired using single-shot gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with TR of 2000 ms, TE of 30 ms, FA of 90\u00b0, field of view (FOV) of 232 mm \u00d7 232 mm, and in-plane resolution of 64 \u00d7 64. Thirty-three 3 mm thick AC\u2013PC parallel slices with 0.6 mm interslice gap were prescribed to cover the whole brain. During the rs-fMRI scans, the subjects were asked to remain still as much as possible, keep their eyes closed without falling asleep and try not to think systematically. \n\n\n### DATA PREPROCESSING \n  \nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging data were preprocessed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM5)  and REST toolbox  ( ). The first 10 volumes of the functional images were discarded to equilibrate the signal and to allow participants\u2019 adaptation to the scanning noise. Then functional images were corrected for slice timing and realigned for head motion correction. A 12-parameter affine transformation was estimated from each individual functional space into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, and the functional images were transformed to MNI space and re-sampled to 3-mm isotropic voxels. After smoothing with a 6 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel, the linear and quadric trends of time courses were removed. Several nuisance variables, including six head motion parameters, as well as the averaged signal from white matter and ventricles, were removed from the preprocessed time courses by multiple linear regression analysis. \n\n\n### HEAD MOTION \n  \nTo moderate the effects of head motion on ALFF, we first excluded three TS subjects and one control subject with excessive head movement > 3 mm maximum displacement in any of the x, y, or z directions or >3\u00b0 of rotation in any direction. Moreover, given that \u201cmicro\u201d head movements from one time point to the next can introduce systematic artifactual inter-individual and group differences in rs-fMRI metrics ( ;  ;  ;  ), it is recommended to scrub (remove or regress) time points with sudden movement on individual data ( ). However, since the scrubbing procedure alters the underlying temporal structure of the data, precluding its application to frequency-based ALFF analysis( ), we chose to exclude the subjects who were of too much sudden micro head motion. For each subject, we counted the motion-contaminated fMRI volumes with framewise displacement (FD) > 0.5 mm and their one back and two forward neighbors. Subjects with less than 90 volumes (3 min) that were uncontaminated were excluded [one healthy control (HC) subject was excluded]. There were no significant differences in any of the six head motion parameters (all   p  s > 0.05) or the mean FD measure (  p   = 0.74) between the remaining 17 TS subjects and 15 HC subjects. \n\n\n### ALFF AND fALFF ANALYSIS \n  \nThe REST toolbox was used to calculate the ALFF/fALFF. After the above preprocessing, the fMRI data were temporally band-pass filtered (0.01\u20130.1 Hz) to reduce low-frequency drift and high-frequency respiratory and cardiac noise. The time courses were first converted to the frequency domain using a fast Fourier transform (FFT), and the power spectrum was obtained. The power spectrum obtained by FFT was square-rooted and then averaged across 0.01\u20130.1 Hz at each voxel. This averaged square-root was taken as the ALFF. To compute fALFF, the time courses were transformed into the frequency domain without band-pass filtering, and the sum of the amplitude across 0.01\u20130.1 Hz was divided by that of the entire frequency range (0\u20130.25 Hz). To reduce the global effects of variability across the participants, the ALFF/fALFF of each voxel was divided by the global mean ALFF/fALFF value within the entire brain. The global mean ALFF/fALFF was calculated only within the brain, with the background and other tissues outside the brain removed. These normalized ALFF and fALFF values were used for further statistical analyses. \n\n\n### STATISTICAL ANALYSIS \n  \nDifferences in demographic and clinical data between TS patients and healthy controls were analyzed using two-sample   t  -test and \u03c7 -test in SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., USA). \n\nTo investigate the differences in ALFF and fALFF between the two groups, a two-sample   t  -test was performed on the individual normalized ALFF and fALFF maps. To control for the possible influences of head motion on group-related results, we included individual mean motion estimates (i.e., mean FD) as a nuisance covariate ( ;  ;  ). Significant threshold was set at a corrected   p   = 0.05 combined with a cluster threshold of 117 voxels based on Monte Carlo simulations. To investigate the relationship between ALFF and clinical behavior (i.e., tic severity score), regression analysis was carried out between ALFF and the YGTSS scores with mean FD as a covariate in a voxel-by-voxel manner. The statistical threshold was set at a corrected   p   < 0.05 with a cluster threshold of 117 voxels. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS \n  \n Table    shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the TS patients and the healthy controls.

Compared with healthy controls, the children with TS exhibited significantly decreased ALFF in the posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus and bilateral parietal gyrus. fALFF was decreased in TS children in the anterior cingulated cortex, bilateral middle and superior frontal cortices and superior parietal lobule, and increased in the left putamen and bilateral thalamus. We also found that fALFF in the left thalamus was positively correlated with tic severity in the TS children. The implication of these abnormalities for TS patients is discussed below. \n\nWe found significantly increased fALFF in the basal ganglia regions including the putamen and thalamus in the TS children group, which are important portions within the CSTC circuit. The model of dysfunction of CSTC in TS hypothesized that increased activity in striatal regions (i.e., caudate and putamen) inhibits the output nuclei of the basal ganglia and releases the thalamus from inhibition, which in turn excite the cortex to the production of tics ( ). Previous fMRI studies have provided evidence in support of this model. For example, reduced activity in striatal regions and thalamus has been reported during tic suppression in TS children ( ), while increased activity of these regions has been found during the spontaneous tic performance in TS adults ( ;  ). Therefore, consistent with the dysfunction of the CSTC model, our results of increased fALFF in the striatal region of putamen may indicate that the excess activity in putamen disinhibits the thalamus, which also exhibited increased fALFF herein, and ultimately excites the cortex to yield unwanted tics. Furthermore, we observed that the increased fALFF in the thalamus was positively correlated with tic severity, confirming its putative role in the pathogenesis of TS. \n\nWe also found decreased fALFF in the middle and superior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulated cortex, and decreased ALFF and fALFF in the parietal gyrus in children with TS. These regions have been suggested to be involved in executive control functions ( ), and are associated with cognitive impairments in TS, including response inhibition, selective attention, and cognitive flexibility ( ;  ;  ). Previous fMRI studies in TS have demonstrated functional abnormalities in frontal and/or parietal areas. In children with TS, the prefrontal regions exhibited greater activation than in children without TS during a switching task ( ;  ). Studies in TS adults have found that putative executive control regions, including the anterior cingulate, bilateral insula, and frontal and parietal regions, increased their activity prior to tic onset ( ) and during tic suppression ( ), while exhibited less activity during spontaneous tic behavior ( ). In a recent rs-fMRI study,   investigated functional connections between regions within two control networks, i.e., the frontal-parietal network involved in adaptive online control and the cingulo-opercular network involved in stable set maintenance, and compared these connections in TS adolescents to typical developing subjects. They found significant immaturity in functional connections within both control networks, with frontal-parietal network experiencing the most abnormalities. Together with this evidence, our results of reduced ALFF/fALFF may be reflective of a disrupted cortical control circuit, which likely causes failure in inhibition of tic behaviors and abnormalities in cognitive control and executive functions in TS, and provide further support for the notion that TS model has been extended beyond CSTC circuitry ( ). \n\nThe children with TS have less intrinsic functional activity in the PCC/PCUN, which is a key region of the so-called default mode network ( ;  ). The posterior cingulate is thought to be involved in internally directed thought, such as retrieval of episodic and semantic memories ( ;  ). More recently, PCC has also been demonstrated to play a role in regulating the balance between internal and external cognitive functions ( ). Previous results show that the Tourette group failed to deactivate the PCC to the extent that healthy comparison subjects deactivated it during an eye blinking suppression task ( ). In another study, default mode regions including PCC were found to show attenuated deactivations with age and associated with poorer performance in Tourette adults during a Stroop task ( ). The inability to deactivate the PCC in these studies suggests dysregulation between internal and external processing which may result in impaired abilities to suppress blink or to perform an executive task. In line with this evidence, our result of reduced intrinsic functional activity in the PCC/PCUN may represent functional disturbance in TS patients, which may lead to impaired regulation of tic and executive behaviors. \n\nAbnormalities in intrinsic functional activity have previously been reported in TS comorbid disorders, including ADHD and OCD. For example, ADHD patients demonstrated aberrant ALFF in the anterior cingulate cortex, frontal and sensorimotor cortex ( ;  ), while OCD patients showed abnormal ALFF mainly in the anterior cingulate cortex and parietal cortex ( ). However, studies of intrinsic functional activity during resting-state in these disorders are still limited, and it remains unclear whether TS subjects share the disruptions in the same or similar brain circuits. \n\n### LIMITATIONS \n  \nThe current study has several limitations. Firstly, given the relatively small sample size, further studies with a larger sample will be necessary to replicate, extend, and assess the generalizability of these findings. Secondly, we studied a highly selected patient population without clinically relevant psychiatric comorbidity and treatment history, in consideration that the pure TS sample could assure the resulting differences with healthy control are attributed to TS itself and not confounded by medication or comorbid disorders ( ;  ). However, as we mentioned before, TS is strongly comorbid with ADHD (50% with TS also have ADHD) and OCD (20\u201360% with TS also have OCD;  ), thus future studies using similar techniques should be carried out in TS patients with comorbidities and also OCD and ADHD patients without TS for comparison. Thirdly, our findings of the alterations in resting-state functional activity still need to be supported by future studies incorporating task design that allow for the identification of specific cognitive processes to further clarify the underlying components of these abnormal brain regions in TS individuals. For example, task design regarding executive control function such as stop-signal and task switching paradigm could help to understand the differences in frontal-parietal regions between TS and control group. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nIn conclusion, the present study adopted the ALFF/fALFF approach on rs-fMRI data to investigate the alterations in spontaneous neural activity in TS patients. Abnormalities in TS children, including decreased ALFF in the posterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral parietal cortices, decreased fALFF in the anterior cingulated cortex, bilateral middle and superior frontal cortices and superior parietal lobule, and increased fALFF in the left putamen and bilateral thalamus, were consistent with previous model of dysfunction of CSTC circuit, and extend the disrupted anatomical pathology of TS to cortical control network and default mode network. The relationship between abnormal fALFF and the tic severity provided further support for our findings. These results shed light on the underlying neurophysiological mechanism reflected in the intrinsic brain activity in TS and demonstrate the feasibility of using the ALFF/fALFF as a research and clinical tool to access the dysfunction in TS. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nYonghua Cui, Xu Chen, Yong He, Xia Liang, and Yi Zheng designed the study.

Such fast response to emotion words may arise independently of the left occipitotemporal area involved in visual word-form analysis and rely on a distinct amygdala-dependent emotion circuit involved in fearful face processing. Using a hemifield priming paradigm with fMRI, we explored how the left and right amygdala systems interact with the reading network during emotion word processing. On each trial, participants viewed a centrally presented target which was preceded by a masked prime flashed either to the left or right visual field. Primes and targets, each denoting negative or positive nouns, could be either affectively congruent or incongruent with each other. We observed that affective congruency produced parallel changes in neural priming between the left frontal and parietotemporal regions and the bilateral amygdala. However, we also found that the left, but not right, amygdala exhibited significant change in functional connectivity with the neural components of reading as a function of affective congruency. Collectively, these results suggest that emotion words activate the bilateral amygdala during early stages of emotion word processing, whereas only the left amygdala exerts a long-distance regulatory influence over the reading network   via   its strong within-hemisphere connectivity. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFluent reading begins with fast visual analysis of written words which in turn activates multiple neurocognitive systems involved in language processing. Cognitive models of reading generally assume that fine-grained visual analysis of letter-strings is a pivotal step preceding phonological activation, meaning comprehension and spoken production ( ;  ). At the neural level, this initial orthographic processing relies on the left occipitotemporal region associated with higher order visual recognition ( ;  ). In parallel with the cognitive models of reading, the occipitotemporal region is known to have structural and functional coupling with other left-hemisphere regions, including the lateral temporal area associated with meaning ( ), inferior parietal area involved in phonological conversion ( ), and frontotemporal junction area involved in pronunciation ( ;  ). These neural structures form a mature reading network across variously different writing systems ( ;  ). Interestingly, however, recent neuroimaging data suggest that skilled reading involves a broader set of neural structures than thought previously, including the sensorimotor and limbic systems. For example, the sensorimotor cortex outside the classical reading network is shown to play a role in semantic processing of nouns and verbs associated with body parts and their actions ( ;  ;  ). \n\nLikewise, the efficient reading network may extend to neural emotion circuits involved in prosody and fear processing. For example, recent observations suggest that emotional prosodic sensitivity plays a greater role in normal reading development than known previously ( ;  ;  ). In fact, emotional words constitute a special class of verbal stimuli which quickly activate the evolutionarily older limbic system, including the amygdala and cingulate cortex in both hemispheres, well outside the typical reading network (see   for review). In particular, the amygdala complex is known to rapidly respond to emotion words at an early stage of reading, i.e., ~200 ms after stimulus onset ( ;  ;  ), which is almost identical to the known response latency of the occipitotemporal visual word-form area (VWFA) responsible for orthographic processing ( ). This in turn suggests that the amygdala can detect the emotional content of written words even before orthographic and subsequent stages of word processing (e.g., phonological and lexico-semantic) occur in the left-hemisphere network. Indeed, such early sensitivity to emotional content may arise from neural systems outside the classical reading network, in particular, a direct pathway linking the amygdala with early visual regions and subcortical structures, which is shown to be functioning during the fast recognition of fearful faces ( ;  ;  ). This sounds plausible given the fact that we can easily read affective meanings from character-like emoticons (e.g.,   and  ) and seems to concur with the notion that cultural acquisitions, such as reading and arithmetic, rely on the \u201cneuronal recycling\u201d of pre-existing brain circuits ( ). \n\nIn fact, a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study by   showed strong functional coupling between the extrastriate cortex and the amygdala in the right hemisphere during emotion word processing. More recently, however,   observed functional connectivity between the extrastriate cortex and amygdala in the left hemisphere during reading of affective adjectives. These observations therefore support the putative contribution of the extrastriate-amygdala route to the fast processing of emotion words, but seem conflicting in terms of the hemispheric dominance in functional connectivity. More generally, the existing neuroimaging literature of reading seems rather inconsistent as to how the left- and right-hemisphere systems contribute to affective word processing, since activation patterns of the amygdala and extrastriate cortex have been reported as being \u201cleft-lateralized\u201d ( ;  ;  ), \u201cright-lateralized\u201d ( ;  ;  ), or \u201cbilateral\u201d ( ;  ;  ). \n\nOn the one hand, it is possible that the left-hemisphere system, including the amygdala, plays a primary role in emotion word processing, because reading   per se   is a cultural skill relying on the left-hemisphere language network ( ;  ). On the other hand, it is also possible that the right-hemisphere system plays a general role in early emotion processing, not only for non-verbal stimuli (e.g., faces, animals and visual scenes) ( ;  ;  ;  ) but also for written words. Indeed, the right hemisphere is shown to be more efficient in extracting coarse semantic information from written words ( ) and thus can be more sensitive to basic categories of affect (e.g., pleasantness, fear, threat) than the left hemisphere even during reading. However, another interesting possibility is that the left- and right-hemisphere systems may contribute to emotion word processing differently from each other ( ;  ). In particular, it has been proposed that the left amygdala first detects the affective meaning of written words and then modulates the cortical activity involved in subsequent stages of word processing ( ). In contrast, the right amygdala may well be equally sensitive to affective meanings during early word processing as described above, but may exert no or only weak modulatory influence over the reading network because of non-efficient callosal transfer. Accordingly, we hypothesized that emotion words activate the bilateral amygdala in early stages of visual word processing, whereas only the left amygdala interacts with the cerebral language network   via   its strong structural-functional connectivity within the left hemisphere. \n\nIn the present study, we used a hemifield priming paradigm ( ) with fMRI. On each trial, participants made semantic judgment about a centrally presented target, which was preceded by a masked prime flashed either to the left or right visual field (LVF or RVF). By manipulating the affective congruency between primes and targets (congruent or incongruent in emotional valence), we maximized the likelihood for isolating neural systems sensitive to the emotional valence of written words and their hemispheric bias. Several past studies used similar hemifield paradigms to explore hemispheric lateralization during affective processing ( ;  ;  ;  ). By delivering masked prime stimuli briefly to each hemifield, this priming paradigm enabled us to stimulate each hemispheric system separately during the early, automatic stage of word processing, since weak neural activation induced by such degraded primes occurs locally within each hemisphere and does not spread across hemispheres ( ;  ). We further performed functional connectivity analysis to assess long-distance interactions between the amygdala and the left-hemisphere reading network. \n  \nBehavioral paradigm. Each trial consisted of a masked prime flashed to LVF or RVF and a visible target displayed on the center of the screen. Primes and targets, each representing either positive or negative nouns, could be either congruent or incongruent with each other in emotional valence. Participants determined whether visible targets represented concrete objects or abstract concepts. \n  \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nFifteen healthy undergraduate students (five females, age range 20\u201322 years) participated in the present study. All participants were right-handed native speakers of Japanese and gave written informed consent prior to the experiments. Two participants were excluded from behavioral and brain imaging analyses because of low accuracy level (< 85%) or excessive head motion (> 2.5 mm). The protocol of this study was approved by the ethics committee of Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine. \n\n\n### Stimuli and Task \n  \nWe selected 96 Japanese nouns written with two logographic characters (kanji) for visual stimuli. Half of them had emotionally positive meanings (e.g., smile, sun, success, love) whereas the other half negative meanings (e.g., funeral, war, despair, decline). In the positive set of words, half represented concrete objects (e.g., smile, sun), whereas the other half abstract concepts (e.g., success, love). Likewise, half of the negative set represented concrete objects (e.g., funeral, war) and the other half abstract concepts (e.g., despair, decline). Therefore, the stimulus set consisted of four groups of 24 words, each having (1) emotional valence either positive or negative and (2) concreteness either concrete or abstract. Word frequency was matched both between positive and negative words (8.26 vs. 7.92 in log frequency of occurrence) and between concrete and abstract words (8.00 vs. 8.19) according to the NTT Psycholinguistic database ( ). To verify the emotional valence and concreteness of the 96 words, we asked 56 healthy volunteers to rate each of the items with a 7-point scale (emotional valence: 1 = very negative to 7 = very positive, concreteness: 1 = very abstract to 7 = very concrete). Mean emotional valence and concreteness of each set are summarized in  . \n  \nEmotional valence and concreteness for each set of words [Mean (SD)]. Chi-square tests confirmed that emotional valence and concreteness were not affected by each other (  p   > 0.8 for both). \n  \nEach trial consisted of central fixation, a forward mask (~3.0\u00b0 in visual length), a masked prime and a visual foil (\u201c%%%,\u201d ~3.0\u00b0), a backward mask (~3.0\u00b0) and a centrally-presented target (3.0\u00b0) ( ). Each target was followed by a blank period for ~570 ms such that the stimulus-onset-asynchrony for targets was set to 2.8 s without jittering. The forward and backward masks were created by semi-random arrangement of circle and square shapes with the same line thickness as character fonts and centered on the left and right sides (3.0\u00b0) of the central fixation cross. Masked primes and visual foils were assigned pseudo-randomly either to LVF or RVF with a probability of 50%. Primes and targets were either emotionally congruent (i.e., same in valence) or incongruent (i.e., different in valence) with each other. On the dimension of concreteness, primes and targets were always congruent with each other, whereby concrete targets and abstract targets were preceded by concrete primes and abstract primes, respectively. Therefore, while the emotional valence of stimuli might be rather unevenly polarized (see  ), the effect of affective congruency priming was kept orthogonal to the functional requirements of the behavioral task. \n\nIn general, masked primes presented for >50 ms are partially visible for most healthy participants ( ), but we used the present experimental setting because (1) reliable effects of behavioral and fMRI priming can be obtained with masked words in parafoveal vision ( ;  ) and (2) the present level of prime duration still allows assessing early and automatic stages of reading ( ;  ;  ). On each trial, participants decided as quickly and accurately as possible whether targets represented concrete objects or abstract concepts by pressing keys with their left and right thumbs. Each participant received four sessions, each consisting of 240 trials (24 trials per condition and 48 word-absent baseline trials per session). \n\n\n### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Procedures \n  \nImaging data were acquired in Kyoto University Hospital using a Siemens Trio 3 Tesla head scanner with a standard head coil optimized for a gradient echo-echo planar imaging (22 contiguous axial slices, thickness 4 mm with 1 mm gap, TR = 1,400 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, field-of-view = 256 \u00d7 256 mm , 64 \u00d7 64 pixels). High-resolution T1 anatomical images were obtained after the main experiment (160 contiguous axial slices, thickness 1 mm without gap, TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 3.39 ms, inversion time = 990 ms, flip angle = 8\u00b0, field-of-view = 176 \u00d7 192 mm , 176 \u00d7 192 pixels). Each participant received four scanning sessions, each lasting 700 s and yielding 500 volumes. \n\n\n### Data Analysis \n  \nFunctional imaging data were analyzed using SPM12 . Images from each subject were corrected for head movements, normalized to the MNI template with a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm  voxel size, and spatially smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian filter (5 mm width at half maximum). These images were high-pass filtered at 120 s and smoothed with a 4 s Gaussian kernel. For each participant, a weighted-mean image for each contrast was computed by fitting each voxel time-series with the known time-series of the eight event types convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function and its temporal and dispersion derivatives. These contrast images were submitted to the second-level analysis using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Response suppression and enhancement were calculated as decrease and increase of activation in congruent trials (i.e., primes and targets share the same valence) relative to incongruent trials, respectively ( ). In particular, crossover interaction between prime valence and affective priming was calculated as response suppression for positive primes and response enhancement for negative primes and response irrespective of hemifield. Unless stated otherwise, statistical significance was assessed with voxel-level   p   < 0.001 and cluster-level   p   < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons with family-wise error. To examine priming effects in the amygdala more closely, we used two 5-mm radius spherical regions-of-interest (ROIs) each centered at the left basolateral amygdala (\u221230, \u22124, \u221234) and its right homologous site (30, \u22124, \u221234) previously associated with masked emotion words ( ) and fearful faces ( ). For each ROI, neural effects of affective congruency (\u201caffective priming\u201d) were assessed for each priming condition with voxel-level   p   < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons. \n\nWe next performed psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses ( ) to assess functional connectivity with amygdala during emotion word processing. In brief, PPI computes functional coupling between a seed ROI and all other regions induced by psychological context. Since the whole-brain SPM revealed robust changes in neural priming as a function of prime valence (see section \u201cResults\u201d), we selected this valence-by-priming interaction as a critical contrast for assessing fast changes in functional connectivity during emotion word processing. Regional responses per session per participant were extracted by calculating the principal eigenvariate across all voxel for each of the left and right amygdala ROIs described above. For each participant, the PPI regressor was calculated as an element-by-element product of the amygdala response (physiological regressor) and a vector coding for the valence x priming interaction (psychological regressor) for each ROI. A whole-brain general linear model was computed using the three types of regressors for each participant. Contrast images representing the PPI were created for each ROI for each participant and submitted to the ANOVA treating the side of the amygdala (left vs. right) as a within-participant factor. Since the whole-brain SPM identified the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG), left posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and left occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) as neural correlates of the valence x priming interaction (see \u201cResults\u201d), we examined functional connection strength with the amygdala in this left-hemisphere network involved in emotion word processing (  p   < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). \n\nAdditionally, we performed   post hoc   power analysis for ROI analyses using G*Power . The   post hoc   assessment of statistical power is crucial for the present ROI analysis whose condition effects were smaller compared to those obtained in the highly conservative whole-brain analysis. We calculated the effect-size threshold   by converting the voxel-level   Z   = 1.67 (corresponding to uncorrected   p =   0.05) with the sample size of 13 participants. The obtained effect-size (  = 0.21) was submitted to   post hoc   power analysis for within-participant factor repeated measures ANOVA with the following parameters:   \u03b1   = 0.05, number of measures = 8, non-sphericity correction   \u03b5   = 1. We confirmed that the actual power of the experiment was sufficiently high (93.53%) despite the limited sample size. This can be attributed to the well-known power advantage of repeated measures designs which reduces the amount of error variance by factoring out the error term derived from between-participant variability ( ;  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Results \n  \nMean accuracy (SD) during the concrete/abstract judgment task was 89.95 (4.25) %. Median reaction times for correct responses are presented in  . We first submitted the RT data to Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test for normality and Levene test for homoscedasticity and confirmed that these RT data met the assumption of normality (  p   = 0.15) and homogeneity of variance (  p   > 0.5) required for subsequent ANOVAs. We then performed a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 ANOVA treating the effects of prime valence (positive vs. negative), prime hemifield (LVF vs. RVF) and affective priming (congruent vs. incongruent), as within-participant factors. The main effects of valence and priming were both non-significant [  F  (1, 12) = 3.43,   p   = 0.089,   = 0.22 and   F  (1, 12) = 3.40,   p   = 0.90,   = 0.22, respectively]. However, these effects showed a robust cross-over interaction with each other [  F  (1, 12) = 35.50,   p   < 0.0001,   = 0.74], suggesting that the directions of affective priming changed with valence. The effect of hemifield never approached the level of significance (  F   < 1) but interacted with the effect of priming, suggesting that the overall magnitude of priming was greater for RVF than for LVF [11 vs. 0 ms,   F  (1, 12) = 5.14,   p   = 0.043,   = 0.30, see below for further analyses]. Other interactions were all non-significant (  p   > 0.2 for all). \n  \nBehavioral results. Median reaction times (SEM) during the concrete/abstract judgment task as a function of prime valence (positive and negative) and prime hemifield (LVF and RVF). Participants responded faster to congruent (C) targets than to incongruent (IC) targets when masked primes were positive in valence. In contrast, participants responded faster to incongruent targets than to congruent targets when masked primes were negative in valance. This reversal of priming directions was observed on both LVF and RVF trials and confirmed by a robust cross-over interaction between the effects of valence and affective priming (see section \u201cResults\u201d). \n  \nTo further assess the observed interaction between valence and congruency, we then examined the effects of affective priming separately for negative and positive primes. When the analysis was restricted to positive primes, participants responded faster on congruent trials than on incongruent trials (614 vs. 639 ms), yielding a significant facilitatory effect of affective priming [  F  (1, 12) = 31.72,   p   = 0.0001,   = 0.73]. This facilitatory priming did not interact with the effect of hemifield, suggesting that the magnitude of priming did not differ between LVF and RVF [  F  (1, 12) =2.98,   p   = 0.11,   = 0.20]. On the other hand, when restricted to negative prime trials, participants responded more slowly on congruent trials than on incongruent trials (639 vs. 623 ms), thus yielding a significant inhibitory effect of priming [  F  (1, 12) = 16.89,   p   = 0.0015,   = 0.59]. The magnitude of the inhibitory priming did not differ between LVF and RVF [  F  (1, 12) = 2.48,   p   = 0.14,   = 0.17]. To summarize, these findings show that masked primes produced different patterns of affective priming as a function of valence, whereas these effects did not change with the prime hemifield. \n\n\n### Imaging Results \n  \nThe concrete/abstract semantic judgment task broadly activated the bilateral frontoparietal and temporal regions relative to the baseline. We assessed the effects of prime valence, prime hemifield, and affective congruency priming and their interactions. In parallel with the behavioral data, the main effects of affective priming and valence were both non-significant, but showed robust interaction in the left hemisphere (  and  ). In particular, we observed a large cluster in the left IFG which included the local maximum at the ventrolateral part (\u221242, 26, 18,   Z   = 5.33) and two subpeaks in the orbital part (\u221248, 44, 4,   Z   = 5.10; \u221248, 36, 10,   Z   = 4.82). The same valence-by-priming interaction was also found in the left OTC (\u221240, \u221250, \u221218,   Z   = 4.56), bilateral ACG (\u22124, 20, 52,   Z   = 5.17), and left PPC (\u221238, \u221258, 66,   Z   = 4.30). Indeed, activation profiles of these regions revealed that the directions of neural priming changed with the affective valence of primes, i.e., repetition suppression for positive primes, and enhancement for negative primes (see  ). It is of note that the large cluster in the left OTC encompasses the canonical coordinates of the VWFA (\u221240, \u221250, \u221214) ( ). The main effects of hemifield and other interactions were all non-significant (  Z   < 2 for all). \n  \nBrain regions showing cross-over interaction between valence and affective priming. \n    \nBrain regions showing cross-over interaction between valence and affective priming. For each region, percent signal change relative to the baseline is plotted against the valence (positive and negative) and prime hemifield (LVF and RVF). The whole-brain SPM analysis identified three left hemisphere regions showing significant changes in priming directions associated with the reversal of behavioral priming. That is, the left IFG, ACC, PPC, and OTC showed repetition enhancement associated with inhibitory priming (i.e., to negative primes) and repetition suppression associated with facilitatory priming (i.e., to positive primes), respectively. \n  \nIn subsequent analyses, we examined the effects of congruency separately for positive and negative primes within the four regions showing the valence x congruency interaction (inclusive masking, corrected at   p   < 0.05). When the analysis was restricted to negative primes, the effect of response enhancement was significant at the left IFG (\u221250, 34, 10,   Z   = 4.86); left ACG (\u22126, 14, 56,   Z   = 4.86); left OTC (\u221240, \u221252, \u221218,   Z   = 3.60); and left PPC (\u221234, \u221250, 50,   Z   = 3/52). On the other hand, positive primes produced significant effects of response suppression in the left IFG (\u221240, 26, 18,   Z   = 4.12); left ACG (\u22122, 22, 52,   Z   = 3.22); left OTC (\u221242, \u221248, \u221220,   Z   = 3.53); and left PPC (\u221244, \u221254, 64,   Z   = 3/34). Thus, these findings further validate the observed cross-over valence \u00d7 priming interaction in the left-hemisphere reading network (see  ), which directly reflects the reversal of behavioral priming effects (i.e., facilitatory for positive primes and inhibitory for negative primes). \n\nNext, we looked at the effects of affective priming in the left and right amygdala ROIs to assess hemispheric differences in early stages of emotion word processing ( ). We first examined the same valence-by-priming interaction as described above for each ROI. This impact of valence on neural priming was significant in the right amygdala (  p   = 0.003,   Z   = 3.43) and showed a non-significant trend in the left amygdala (  p   = 0.08,   Z   = 2.05), suggesting that the amygdala changed its directions of priming in parallel with the left-hemisphere reading network (see  ). On the other hand, the magnitude of priming-by-valence interaction did not differ between LVF primes and RVF primes, either in the left amygdala or in the right amygdala (  p   > 0.05 for both). These findings suggest that amygdala activation is bilateral with slight right hemispheric bias during early stages of emotion word processing. \n  \nEffects of affective priming in the left and right amygdala ROIs. The left and right amygdala ROIs showed the similar patterns of cross-over interaction between valence and affective priming as those observed in the whole-brain SPM (see  ). The magnitude of this valence \u00d7 priming interaction did not differ between LVF and RVF, either for the left amygdala or for the right amygdala. Thus, negative and positive primes each showed the same trend of repetition enhancement and repetition suppression as the cerebral reading network, irrespective of the prime hemifield. \n  \nIn PPI analysis, we asked how the bilateral amygdala interacted with the left-hemisphere reading network showing the reversal of priming. Specifically, since the bilateral amygdala exhibited different patterns of priming between positive and negative primes, we examined how this valence x priming interaction was represented in the connection strength between the amygdala and the four cortical components of reading ( ). For the left amygdala, we observed significant increase in functional coupling with the left IFG (  p   = 0.035,   Z   = 3.49) but not with other regions (  p   > 0.4 for ACG and   p   > 0.15 for OTC and PPC, respectively). In contrast, the right amygdala showed no significant change in coupling strength with any of the four regions (  p   > 0.3 for IFG,   p   > 0.3 for ACG,   p   > 0.1 for OTC and   p   > 0.5 for PPC, respectively). For the left IFG, moreover, the left-vs.-right difference in amygdala connectivity was significant (  Z   = 3.16, see  ). Other regions showed no significant left-vs.-right difference in connection strength (  p   > 0.5 for all). Taken together, these findings suggest that the left, but not the right, amygdala exerts a regulatory influence over the reading network   via   the left IFG during emotion word processing. \n  \nFunctional connectivity with the amygdala in the left-hemisphere network involved in fast emotion word processing. Box plots for each region show the magnitude of group-level inter-regional connectivity with the left and right amygdala ROIs. The four cortical regions identified in the whole-brain SPM (see  ) are surface-rendered on the normalized brain using MRIcron ( ). Significant functional coupling was observed only between the left IFG and the left amygdala (shaded in gray, see section \u201cResults\u201d). Moreover, while all the four regions showed the same trend of greater connectivity with the left amygdala than with the right amygdala, this left-vs.-right difference in amygdala connectivity was significant only for the left IFG (  p   = 0.04). \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nBehavioral research indicates that emotional stimuli (e.g., fearful faces and scenes) are recognized more rapidly than neutral stimuli ( ;  ;  ). Interestingly, while reading in itself is not such innate visual behavior but a learned cultural skill, the same behavioral advantage is shown to occur when emotional stimuli are presented as written words ( ;  ;  ). Emotional word processing is thus likely to involve neurocognitive systems distinct from the classical language network. Specifically, the amygdala complex, known to quickly respond to affective meanings of visual stimuli, is the most likely neural component for reading emotion from words. \n\nBehaviorally, we observed a robust cross-over interaction between valence and priming, whereby affective priming appeared as a facilitatory effect for positive primes and as an inhibitory effect for negative primes, respectively. In fact, emotional valence is shown to change the directions of affective priming, for both verbal and non-verbal stimuli ( ;  ;  ). Because masked priming effects generally reflect fast and bottom-up lexico-semantic activation during reading ( ), our behavioral results suggest that emotional valence of masked primes rapidly changes the functional connectivity in the cerebral reading network. \n\nIndeed, our fMRI results revealed a parallel cross-over interaction at the neural level, which appeared as robust repetition suppression and enhancement in the left frontal and parietotemporal regions. Since these neural structures are known to be closely associated with functional requirements of the task, i.e., the left IFG and OTC for language processing ( ), visuospatial attention for the PPC ( ) and the ACG for cognitive control ( ), the observed reversal of neural priming is likely responsible for the robust behavioral effects of facilitatory and inhibitory priming. Our ROI analyses further showed significant valence x priming interaction in the bilateral amygdala ( ), indicating the same trend of suppression and enhancement as the one seen in the left-hemisphere reading network. While the precise neurophysiological basis of repetition suppression and enhancement is an issue of controversy in neuroimaging research ( ;  ;  ), the direction of fMRI priming is known to change at different levels of word processing, e.g., lexico-semantic relations ( ;  ), task requirements ( ), and visibility of stimuli ( ;  ). \n\nFor the present study, the observed repetition effects may be attributed to more general and endogenous mechanisms, such as attention and expectation, which play a role in determining the directions of neural priming during visual recognition ( ;  ). Given its large effect-size at the behavioral level and broadly distributed effects at the neural level, this reversal of priming may be driven by such global neural mechanism for regulating the entire reading network. Such rapid reconfiguration of functional connectivity can occur since negative stimuli quickly capture attention and strongly engage relevant cognitive resources during visual recognition ( ;  ;  ). Emotional content may also enhance cortical activity at different stages of reading, including visual word-form processing, semantic and contextual analysis ( ;  ). \n\nOur ROI analyses further revealed the similar changes in fMRI priming in the bilateral amygdala. While the amygdala complex has been reported to show different patterns of hemispheric dominance during reading (see section \u201cIntroduction\u201d), this particular finding concurs with previous studies showing bilateral amygdala activation during emotion word processing ( ;  ;  ). Since masked priming effects reflect fast bottom-up activation during visual word recognition ( ;  ), the present finding suggests that masked emotion words activate the bilateral amygdala outside the classical reading network in early stages of reading. \n\nIn PPI analyses, we observed that the valence-by-priming interaction was represented in the connection strength between the left amygdala and the left IFG. By contrast, the right amygdala showed no significant coupling with the left-hemisphere reading network identified in the SPM. Thus, while ROI analyses revealed bilateral effects of affective priming in the amygdala, only the left amygdala produced significant changes in functional connectivity with the left IFG as a function of affective congruency. Collectively, these findings suggest that the left and right amygdala nuclei are both sensitive to affective meanings during the early stage of visual word recognition, whereas only the left amygdala plays a role in regulating the whole reading network. The present results provide direct neuroimaging evidence supporting the proposal that fast amygdala response broadly modulates the neural activity of the language network ( ). Such global regulation of task-relevant neural systems may rely exclusively on the left amygdala, which should be linked with other left-hemisphere regions more strongly than its right homologue. Our PPI results suggest that the long-distance control of the reading network is mediated by the emotion regulation circuit linking the amygdala and the inferior frontal cortex. \n\nSpecifically, the ventrolateral prefrontal region, which showed the highest effect of priming \u00d7 valence interaction (see   and  ), is known to receive inputs from the amygdala and play a role in regulating negative emotion ( ;  ). This ventrolateral IFG may be also involved in switching the directions of fMRI priming according to the semantic content of visual stimuli ( ). Moreover, the basal amygdala targeted in the present ROI analyses has dense reciprocal projections   via   the uncinate fasciculus to the orbital part of the IFG ( ;  ), i.e., an inferior frontal subregion which showed strong prime-by-valence interaction (see section \u201cResults\u201d). Since the ventrolateral and orbital parts of the IFG also have dense structural and functional connections ( ;  ), the observed amygdala-IFG coupling suggests that these emotion circuits play a regulatory role in generating different priming patterns in the left hemisphere. This interpretation seems in good accordance with a recent meta-analysis showing that the orbital IFG is involved in the integration of semantics and emotion ( ). \n\nWhile only the left IFG showed significant change in amygdala connectivity in PPI analyses, it is of note that other components of the reading network could have more constant functional coupling with the amygdala during the semantic judgment task. Given that the amygdala has strong structural connections with the OTC ( ;  ) and ACG ( ), both of these regions may receive sustained inputs from the amygdala during emotion processing. Some caution may be thus needed since the observed IFG-amygdala coupling does not preclude the possible sustained participation of these structures during affective processing. \n\nIn an influential neurocognitive model of cultural acquisition,   propose that visual expertise for written words develops in the ventral visual cortex by reusing occipitotemporal neurons used for recognizing faces in the primate brain. As shown by a recent electrophysiology study by  , emotion word processing may represent an instance of such cultural recycling of pre-existing neural resources, since our fMRI data show that masked emotion words activate the same parts of the bilateral amygdala involved in fearful face processing. If this is the case, such fast neural response may rely not on the occipitotemporal cortex for fine-grained visual analysis but on a subcortical visual pathway linking the pulvinar and the amygdala during fast processing of facial expressions ( ;  ;  ). Indeed, a recent magnetoencephalography study suggests that this subcortical-amygdala route is functioning globally irrespective of spatial frequency and emotion ( ). Semantic content of visual stimuli may be also partially extracted from low-frequency information, because some behavioral studies show significant priming effects from faces ( ) and characters ( ) in peripheral vision, which has only limited sensitivity to high spatial frequency information. Either way, further studies are needed to determine the potential and limits of the fast subcortical pathway in reading. \n\nIn conclusion, while normal reading is generally known to rely on neural components involved in phonological and lexico-semantic activation in the left hemisphere, our fMRI results show that expert reading does not uniquely consist of a well-ordered series of neural processes but involves more distributed and evolutionarily older non-linguistic systems than thought in neurocognitive models of reading. Specifically, we observed that the bilateral amygdala and left orbitofrontal cortex, located outside the classical reading network, constitute tightly interconnected neural components for recognizing the emotional content from written words. Uncovering these supplemental components may help broaden our understanding about the neural basis of normal and impaired reading. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine.

{"text": "Kersey, Alyssa J. and James, Karin H.\nFront Psychol, 2013\n\n# Title\n\nBrain activation patterns resulting from learning letter forms through active self-production and passive observation in young children\n\n# Keywords\n\nfMRI\nbrain\ndevelopment\nchildren\nwriting\nreading\ncursive\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nAlthough previous literature suggests that writing practice facilitates neural specialization for letters, it is unclear if this facilitation is driven by the perceptual feedback from the act of writing or the actual execution of the motor act. The present study addresses this issue by measuring the change in BOLD signal in response to hand-printed letters, unlearned cursive letters, and cursive letters that 7-year-old children learned actively, by writing, and passively, by observing an experimenter write. Brain activation was assessed using fMRI while perceiving letters\u2014in both cursive and manuscript forms. Results showed that active training led to increased recruitment of the sensori-motor network associated with letter perception as well as the insula and claustrum, but passive observation did not. This suggests that perceptual networks for newly learned cursive letters are driven by motor execution rather than by perceptual feedback. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \n### The link between reading and writing \n  \nThe ability to read and write is essential for success in today's society. As such, children begin learning these skills from a very early age. One of the first steps in learning to read is mastering letter recognition. Performance in letter recognition during this early stage has been shown to be predictive of children's literary success. For example, preschoolers' speed and accuracy when naming letters and the presence of delays in letter recognition have both been shown to predict reading skill (O'Connor and Jenkins,  ; Lonigan et al.,  ; Stage et al.,  ). Just as letter identification has been linked to reading, writing abilities have been linked to cognitive processes including spelling (Berninger et al.,  ), text generation while composing (e.g., Berninger et al.,  ,  ,  ; Graham et al.,  ; Connelly et al.,  ), and the note-taking process (Peverly,  ). Several studies have also shown interesting relationships between learning to write and improved word reading (e.g., Berninger et al.,  ,  ,  ; Dunn and Miller,  ) and between writing abilities and the efficiency in learning a pseudoletter (Richards et al.,  ). Other studies have also shown that the type of motor experience can also affect letter perception. Longcamp et al. ( ) found that older preschool children were better able to recognize letters if they had practiced writing them as opposed to typing them. These researchers proposed that the writing condition facilitated an internal model of the letter due to integration of vision, motor commands, and kinesthetic feedback, which typing does not provide. This group suggested that while typing, the children are simply building a cognitive map of the keyboard rather than gaining extensive knowledge about the letters that they learn. Similarly, adults who wrote new pseudoletters were better able to recognize the correct orientation of the character than those who typed them (Longcamp et al.,  ). Researchers attributed this result to the representations of each pseudoletter in memory. Because the writing condition created an association between the motor system, visual system, and kinesthetic feedback, the adults were able to increase their knowledge about the spatial information for each character. The typing condition created an association between the pseudoletter and an arbitrary clue, leading to a less accurate representation of the character. Furthermore, the writing condition is a more complex motor action, suggesting that more intensive motor experiences led to enhanced visual representations. \n\nNeuroimaging research has also suggested an important link between writing and letter perception. The visual system has been shown to process different categories of stimuli with different systems, often referred to as \u201cfunctional specialization.\u201d Whether or not this specialization is due to stimulus category or processing requirements of different stimuli is an active research question (e.g., Kanwisher and Yovel,  ; Bukach et al.,  ), that will not be explicitly addressed here. Nonetheless, functional specialization for the visual processing of words and letters in the fusiform gyrus reveals two interrelated functional regions. The   anterior   left fusiform gyrus has been shown to be more responsive to individual letters than to letter strings, words, digits, or Chinese characters (James et al.,  ), while the   posterior   region of the left fusiform gyrus, described as the visual word form area (VWFA), responds more to letter strings and words than to individual letters (Cohen and Dehaene,  ; James et al.,  ). Interestingly, the anterior region that underlies visual letter perception, is affected by writing experience. Adults that learned to form pseudoletters by hand, showed increased activation in this letter processing region only after pseudoletters were written, but not after typing or visual practice alone (James and Atwood,  ). Similarly, pre-literate children (4\u20135 year olds) that practiced learning letters recruited this region during a subsequent fMRI scan only after printing was incorporated into their learning. Those who learned letters by visual-auditory practice (James,  ) or by typing practice (James and Engelhardt,  ) did not recruit this region during subsequent letter perception. These latter studies provide convincing evidence that printing letters by hand affects the neural processing of letter perception, and by extension, may have a significant effect on the development of reading skills. \n\nFurther evidence for the interaction between writing and letter perception comes from another interesting set of findings that have shown that during letter perception, motor regions of the brain are active (Longcamp et al.,  ,  ,  ; James and Gauthier,  ; James and Atwood,  ; James and Engelhardt,  ). Similar motor system activation has been shown during the visual perception of tools (Chao and Martin,  ) and during verb reading (Hauk et al.,  ), demonstrating that systems that are used during action are re-activated during visual perception. It has been proposed that these networks are driven by interactions with the letters via motor experiences such as writing, leading to a similar re-activation of motor systems during visual perception (James and Atwood,  ; James and Engelhardt,  ). \n\nIn sum, functional specialization for letters likely develops through motor experiences during the initial stages of learning. Further, the motor experience of writing greatly enhances the response of neural substrates for letter perception more so than typing motor experience (Longcamp et al.,  ,  ; James and Atwood,  ; James and Engelhardt,  ). \n\n\n### Differences between cursive script and manuscript \n  \nMuch of this previous research focused on hand-printed letters or on pseudoletters (letter-like symbols). Very little research has been performed to address the relationship between reading and writing in regards to cursive letters. Cursive letters present a unique scenario. By the time most children learn cursive writing, they have learned how to read and write the printed alphabet. Thus, learning cursive letters involves matching a new visual form to, and integrating a new motor plan into, the representation for its hand-printed counterpart. Recently, teaching cursive writing in elementary schools has met with controversy, leading in some cases, to abolishing this requirement in many American elementary school curricula. Nonetheless, little is known about the usefulness of learning cursive writing in terms of literacy outcomes, and the mechanisms that underlie this skill in children are unknown. In adults, a dissociation between processing cursive letters and hand-printed ones has been documented (Qiao et al.,  ; Longcamp et al.,  ) suggesting an important difference between the two, at least in terms of neural processing. The present study addresses the emergence of this dissociation in children first learning to write letters in cursive script. \n\nBehavioral evidence suggests that perceiving letters that are written in cursive is more difficult than perceiving typed letters (Corcoran and Rouse,  ; Qiao et al.,  ). Furthermore, letters written in cursive do not facilitate the speeded perception of letters that are typewritten\u2014that is, they do not \u201cprime\u201d recognition (Qiao et al.,  ). \n\nNeuropsychological studies also offer evidence for dissociations between cursive and manuscript print. Clinical observations have revealed that following a stroke, some aphasic patients display a preference for reading and writing in one modality over the other (Boone and Friedman,  ; Williams,  ). Williams ( ) hypothesized that because the patients who were better at reading cursive had higher combined scores on the reading comprehension task than the patients who were better at print, cursive stimuli might be more beneficial for those with less severe reading comprehension impairments, while those who are more severely impaired may benefit more from printed stimuli. Alternatively, because cursive is more difficult to perceive, the less severely damaged patients could still perform in the cursive tasks, while those who were more severely impaired could only perform when the letters were easier to perceive (manuscript print). In a case study, Hanley and Peters ( ) discuss the unique writing patterns of HN, who, following a stroke, could print uppercase letters, but struggled when it came to printing lowercase letters. However, his ability to write lowercase letters in cursive remained relatively intact. These clinical cases suggest that different mechanisms underlie, not only the perception, but also the production of cursive and printed letters. \n\nImaging studies have also addressed this apparent dissociation in adults. Longcamp et al. ( ) used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate the distinction between handwritten printed and cursive letters. The researchers suspected that part of the distinction in processing cursive and hand-printed letters was due to personal knowledge about motor rules involved in writing, and for this reason, they focused their study on the motor cortex. They found more suppression in the motor cortex after participants' viewed handwritten cursive letters compared to printed letters, suggesting that the motor cortex is recruited more by handwritten cursive letters. More recent studies also found recruitment of motor regions during perception of cursive letters. One study using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), found that recognition of handwritten cursive letters involved the motor cortex, as evidenced by reduced corticospinal excitability for the right hand (Nakatsuka et al.,  ). Another study found that Exner's area in the left dorsal premotor cortex was sensitive to whether dynamic cursive letters were presented forward or backward (Nakamura et al.,  ). To date only one fMRI study has looked at the neural correlates of perceiving handwritten cursive letters throughout the whole brain. Longcamp et al. ( ) replicated their previous results from the MEG study (Longcamp et al.,  ) and found greater motor activation in the left primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area during the perception of handwritten cursive letters compared to the perception of hand-printed letters. Other non-motor areas were also implicated in the network for cursive letter processing, including the right superior frontal, middle occipital, and parahippocampal gyri, and the left inferior precentral and fusiform gyri. To date this is the only study that used neuroimaging methods at the whole-brain level to study the distinction between perceiving cursive and printed letters. \n\nThe recently uncovered neural networks for cursive letters in the adult brain implicate the motor cortex as a major part of the distinction seen in processing printed and cursive letters (Longcamp et al.,  ,  ; Nakatsuka et al.,  ; Nakamura et al.,  ). Although letter perception recruits the left motor cortex, perceiving cursive letters appears to enhance this activation in adults. To further understand why cursive letters have this effect, studying the   formation   of the neural substrates that underlie cursive writing would be fruitful. One purpose of the present work was to do just this: examine how networks are created during the initial experience of learning to write in cursive script. The question was whether very limited experience with writing in cursive would serve to link the motor and visual systems during letter perception or would extensive experience be required. That is, would we see the neural differences between manuscript print and cursive script that is observed in the adult, in children who are just learning to write in cursive script. \n\nA second purpose of the present work was to investigate whether the motor act of writing letters was required for sensori-motor systems to respond to letter perception, or if observing another person write would result in the same neural response during subsequent perception. By introducing a true passive control in which the visual feedback of how the letter unfolds matches the visual feedback received during the production of letters, this study is the first to further isolate the effects of motor experience on the development of visual processing of letters. While previous research (James and Atwood,  ; James,  ; James and Engelhardt,  ) suggests that the letters that children learn by motor production will develop functional specialization, it is unclear how perceptual networks will develop in response to letters learned in this true passive condition (where the visual \u201cunfolding\u201d of the percept is shown to the participants). If the act of motor production leads to functional specialization for letters, the letters that children learn by production would show a more adult-like response during subsequent perception than other cursive letters that the children do not produce themselves. However, if the visual feedback from motor production drives the specialization, then all learned cursive letters should show the same patterns of activation, whether actively produced or passively observed. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSeventeen right-handed children (6.9\u20137.8 years, mean age of 7.4 years, 9 female) participated in this study. Handedness was assessed using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield,  ). All children could read at or above a normal level for their age, print their name and selected letters, and had not yet started learning cursive in school. Additionally, all children had normal or corrected to normal vision and were native English speakers. Informed written consent was obtained from the parents who were compensated with a gift card, while the children were compensated with a small toy or book. All research was approved by the Indiana University Protection of Human Participants board. \n\n\n### Materials \n  \n#### Behavioral training \n  \nParticipants were taught to write letters in a cursive script that were from the Zaner-Bloser (ZB) script library and included twenty-four letters that were divided into three groups (see Figure  ). The letter \u201cf\u201d was excluded as it is the only letter that extends from below the writing line to the top of the writing space, and the letter \u201cc\u201d was excluded due to its similarity to the lowercase printed \u201cc.\u201d The cursive letter recognition test was created with ZB FontsOnline Plus and consisted of eight rows of cursive letters. Each row contained three similar letters, one from each set of cursive letters, repeated three times throughout the line (see Figure   for example). The recognition test was double-sided, resulting in a total of 16 rows so that each of the 16 learned letters could be tested. \n  \n Cursive stimuli divided into groups used for assignment of letters to learning conditions  . \n    \n (A)   An example of the cursive letter pre-test: participants circle each instance of a letter given to them.   (B)   An example of the worksheets used for learning to write cursive script. \n  \nIn the cursive training session, each child learned one group of letters by motor production (actively) and one group by motor observation (passively), leaving one group of cursive letters unlearned. Training worksheets were modeled from worksheets in the Zaner-Bloser Handwriting Level 2C Practice Masters and created with the help of Zaner-Bloser's ZB FontsOnline Plus feature. The worksheets consisted of an example letter with arrows to demonstrate the order of the strokes in each letter, two large letters for tracing, and two sets of a pair of rows with the top row depicting each letter four times and the bottom row blank for children to write each letter under the model letter in the top row. In the bottom row of the first set, two starting dots were included to remind children where to start the letters. This resulted in each letter being traced twice and written eight times (see Figure  ). \n\n\n#### Imaging stimuli \n  \nThree groups of cursive letters were used as stimuli as well as printed letters. The printed letters were presented in Zaner-Bloser manuscript font and the cursive letters were presented in Zaner-Bloser cursive font (see Figure   for examples). All letters were presented in lower-case only. Each stimulus was presented individually and was 3\u201d high by 2\u201d wide. They were centered on the screen, and were presented in black font in a white box on a gray background to minimize brightness. \n\n\n\n### Procedure \n  \n#### Pre-scan session \n  \nPrior to neuroimaging, children completed standardized tests and a behavioral training session. First, the WRAT 4 (Wide Range Achievement Test 4) (Wilkinson and Robertson,  ) Word Reading Subtest Parts 1 (Letter Reading) and 2 (Word Reading) were administered to assess reading level. Part 1 (Letter Writing) of the WRAT4 Spelling Subtest was then administered to evaluate basic letter printing abilities. All children scored at or above normal for their age on all subtests. A pretest of cursive letter recognition was then administered in which children were asked to circle one letter per line when given the name of the letter (see Figure  ). Children were tested on all cursive letters they were about to learn. Following the pretest, children learned eight letters actively by completing worksheets in which the strokes required to write the letters were described as the experimenter pointed to reference points on the example letter. They then traced each letter twice and wrote each letter eight times (see Figure  ). Children learned eight additional letters passively by watching an experimenter complete a worksheet in the same format, matching for time to ensure approximate equal exposure to the letters learned actively and passively. The child and experimenter alternated learning letters and after each had taken a turn, the child was allowed to select a sticker. This encouraged children to pay attention while the experimenter completed her turn. The active and passive sets of letters learned and the order in which the cursive letters were learned were counterbalanced across participants. After the training, and prior to neuroimaging, the same cursive letter recognition was administered as a posttest. The order of target letters for each line was counterbalanced between pre and posttests and across participants. \n\n\n#### Imaging session \n  \nImmediately prior to the imaging session children were taken to an MR simulator so that they could acclimate to the MR environment. Children watched short cartoons while simulated sounds recorded from actual EPI sequences were played in the background. This ensured that participants were not surprised by the loud noises or the confined space. Children practiced lying still while head and body movements were monitored. If they felt comfortable in this environment and if both the child and their parent consented to continuing with the actual neuroimaging, they were then taken directly to the MR scanner. \n\nAt the beginning of the imaging session, a preliminary high-resolution anatomical scan was administered while the child watched a cartoon. Following the anatomical scan were four functional runs. Children were instructed to simply look at the stimuli as they appeared (passive viewing). Stimuli were presented via SuperLab Pro 4 (Cedrus Corporation) on a Macintosh Macbook laptop. A block design was used. Each block consisted of 8 stimuli and lasted for 16 s with 12 s of fixation between each block and a 20 s period of fixation at the beginning of each run. Each stimulus block was repeated at least once per run so that across the 4 runs each stimulus type was presented 5 times. This resulted in two longer runs of 8 blocks lasting 4 min 4 s and two shorter runs of 7 blocks lasting 3 min 36 s. The longer runs were always administered first and the shorter runs followed. Note that there were 2 additional stimulus conditions presented that are not analyzed here, consisting of shape stimuli and were included for another study. Neural activation during perception of the different stimuli was measured by the blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal throughout the brain. Imaging sessions lasted approximately 30 min. \n\n\n\n### fMRI acquisition \n  \nImaging was performed using a 3-T Siemens Magnetom Trio whole-body MRI system and a phased-array 12-channel head coil, located at the Indiana University Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. Images were acquired using an echo-planar technique (  TE   = 20 ms,   TR   = 2000 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0) for BOLD-based imaging. The field of view was 22 \u00d7 22 \u00d7 9.9 cm, with an in-plane resolution of 64 \u00d7 64 and 33 slices per volume that were 4 mm thick. The resulting voxel size was 3.0 \u00d7 3.0 \u00d7 4.0 mm. Functional data underwent slice-time correction, 3D motion correction, linear trend removal, and Gaussian spatial blurring (FWHM 6 mm) using the analysis tools in Brain Voyager\u2122. Individual functional volumes were co-registered to anatomical volumes with an intensity-matching, rigid-body transformation algorithm. Co-registration was to the anatomical volumes acquired at the beginning of the runs. Voxel size of the functional volumes was standardized at 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm using trilinear interpolation. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis procedures \n  \nWhole-brain group contrasts were performed on the resulting data. The functional data were analyzed with a random effects general linear model (GLM) using the Brain Voyager\u2122 multi-subject GLM procedure. The GLM analysis allows for the correlation of predictor variables or functions with the recorded activation data (criterion variables) across scans. The predictor functions were based on the blocked stimulus presentation paradigm of the particular run being analyzed and represent an estimate of the predicted hemodynamic response during that run. Only functional data from right-handed children were analyzed. Any functional data that exceeded 5 mm of motion on any axis during a block other than fixation was excluded from the analysis. This resulted in the exclusion of data from 9 right-handed participants consisting of 3 volumes of data from actively learned letters, 6 volumes from passively learned letters, 4 volumes from unlearned cursive letters, and 2 full runs from one participant. Additionally, one right-handed participant did not complete the MR imaging session. This resulted in data from 16 right-handed children. Individual anatomical data was normalized to the stereotactic space of Talaraich and Tournoux ( ) using an eight-parameter affine non-linear transformation, with parameters selected by visual inspection of anatomical landmarks and by using the Talairach Deamon Applet and Client (Lancaster et al.,  ,  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Overt learning performance \n  \nOverall cursive recognition performance prior to training was 56% (SE.05) and post-training recognition was at 80% (SE.03). To better understand the recognition performance the cursive recognition tests were scored for the 16 participants (that completed the MRI scanning) using a sensitivity measure. When the child circled the target letter, a hit was scored, and when a distractor letter was circled, a false alarm was recorded. Probability of a hit and probability of a false alarm were then calculated for each test. The probability of a false alarm was subtracted from the probability of a hit to obtain a measure of sensitivity in distinguishing amongst the cursive letters. This measure of sensitivity was used in all statistical tests. A 2 (time: pre-learning and post-learning) \u00d7 2 (learning condition: active vs. passive) repeated measures ANOVA was performed and revealed only a main effect of time [  F   = 19.30,   p   < 0.001], but no main effect of learning [  F   = 2.1, n.s.] or an interaction [  F   = 0.35, n.s.]. Thus, there was a learning effect (change over time), but this was not specific to the learning condition. \n\nTo measure the amount of learning that took place during training, the sensitivity score for the pre-test was subtracted from the sensitivity score of the post-test. This was done separately for the letters that the children learned actively, by writing, and the letters that children learned passively, by watching an experimenter write (see Figure  ). To determine if significant learning took place these scores were compared to zero (no learning) using one-sample   t  -tests.   T  -tests indicated that the change in scores from pre-test to post-test was significant for both actively learned letters [mean = 0.2467,   t   = 5.13,   p   < 0.01] and passively learned letters [mean = 0.2145,   t   = 4.12,   p   < 0.01]. A paired samples   t  -test revealed no difference in amount of learning between the active and passive conditions [  t   = 0.698, n.s.]. This suggests that although children were better at identifying cursive letters after the training session, each learning condition resulted in the same amount of learning. \n  \n Difference in pre-test and post-test scores for actively and passively learned letters.   Error bars are standard error of the mean, and asterisk indicate significant difference from chance (no learning) at   p   < 0.05. \n  \n\n### Neural activation \n  \n#### Whole-brain analyses \n  \nSeveral whole-brain contrasts were performed. Individual data was averaged together to create group statistical parametric maps. All results are reported at a voxel-wise error-rate of   p   < 0.01 with a cluster-threshold correction of 8 voxels to obtain an overall family-wise error rate of   p   < 0.05. Reported trends are for areas of activity significant at a voxel-wise error rate of   p   < 0.01 with no cluster-threshold correction applied. See Table   for a complete list of brain regions recruited for the following contrasts. \n  \n Peak Talairach coordinates and range of distribution for each region revealed in whole brain contrasts  . \n  \n  Letter perception vs. rest   . To determine how learning cursive letters actively and passively affected subsequent perception, we performed several contrasts of our learning conditions. First, we compared the perception of all cursive letters to rest. This analysis revealed that when comparing all cursive letters to rest, an extensive region in the Lateral Occipital complex, including the fusiform gyrus, was active bilaterally (see Figure  ). When comparing the individual learning conditions to rest, only the actively learned cursive letters recruited this region, and only in the fusiform gyrus, more than rest (Figure  ). Passively learned letters did not recruit this region greater than rest (Figure  ). Therefore, just as is seen with printed letters, perceiving cursive letters only recruits letter-specific processing regions after active learning. We also compared unlearned cursive letters to rest, which recruited the left LOC, but not the fusiform gyrus (see Figure  ). No regions were significantly active in the remainder of the brain above rest, including motor cortex. \n  \n Contrasts of cursive letters > rest focusing on the lateral occipital complex and the fusiform gyrus.   Depicts individual contrasts of   (A)   all cursive letters > rest,   (B)   actively learned cursive letters > rest,   (C)   passively learned cursive letters > rest, and   (D)   unlearned cursive letters > rest. Family-wise error rate held at   p   < 0.01. \n  \n  Cursive perception vs. print perception   . Three contrasts were performed in an attempt to replicate the findings from Longcamp et al. ( ) of neural differences in processing cursive letters vs. letters printed in manuscript form. All cursive letters (actively learned, passively learned, and unlearned) were compared against printed letters to determine how different learning experiences affect the perception of cursive letters in relation to familiar printed ones. This contrast was balanced by weighting the printed condition \u00d7 3. Unlike the previous findings, cursive letters were not found to significantly recruit any regions more so than printed letters. However, the reverse contrasts revealed several areas that were recruited more for printed than cursive letters. We unpacked these differences by then contrasting each individual cursive learning type (active, passive, and unlearned) to printed letters. \n  \nContrasting printed letters with   actively   learned cursive letters revealed significant activity in the right superior temporal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, the left precentral gyrus, the left medial frontal gyrus, left cerebellum, and several parietal areas including the left postcentral gyrus and left superior parietal lobule, indicating that those areas are recruited more for printed letters in comparison to actively learned cursive letters (see Figure  , left). \n  \nIn comparing the printed letters with   passively   learned cursive letters, printed letters were found to recruit the right superior temporal gyrus, right insula, bilateral precentral gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, bilateral cerebellum and bilateral parahippocampal regions more than for passively learned cursive letters (see Figure  , middle). \n  \nFinally, in comparison to   unlearned   cursive letters, the printed letters recruited the bilateral superior frontal gyrus, the right insula, the left and right precentral gyrus, the left putamen, the right transverse temporal gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyrus, and the cerebellum to a significantly greater degree (see Figure  , right). In sum, these results indicate that printed letter perception recruited several regions more than perception of cursive letters. Furthermore, the location and extent of the recruitment was different when comparing perception of printed letters to each of the three groups of cursive letters, indicating an effect of learning. Of particular note is that the right insula was not recruited differentially to printed and actively learned cursive letters, but was for printed letters vs. passive and unlearned cursive letters. \n    \n Direct contrasts of perception of printed letters > perception of cursive letters broken down by cursive learning condition.   The upper slice denotes of pattern of interest regarding the right insula, which is recruited when printed letters are compared only to passively learned and unlearned cursive. The bottom slice reveals greater recruitment of motor regions for printed letters in comparison to each type of cursive letter. \n  \nCombined with the cursive vs. rest contrasts, these results indicate that although active learning does result in the recruitment of the fusiform gyrus (active cursive vs. rest) during cursive letter perception, it does not do so more than the perception of printed letters. \n\n  Actively learned vs. passively learned cursive letters   . To investigate the differences between learning conditions directly, actively learned and passively learned cursive letters were compared. Contrasting the actively learned cursive letters with the passively learned cursive letters revealed significant recruitment of the bilateral insula and claustrum for the actively learned letters (Figure  ) with trends toward significantly greater recruitment of the left precentral and postcentral gyri (not pictured). These results indicate that self-generated writing leads to greater recruitment of the insula and claustrum regions during subsequent letter perception than does observing letter writing. Interestingly, active vs. passive learning did not differ in the fusiform gyrus when contrasted directly, suggesting that the difference in activation outlined above, when these conditions are compared to rest, is a small (but significant) effect. \n  \n A contrast of perception of actively learned letters > passively learned letters resulted in recruitment of bilateral insula and claustrum  . \n  \n\n#### Region of interest analyses \n  \nThe following analyses were performed on children who showed recruitment of the left fusiform gyrus in a contrast of printed letters > rest at the same threshold used in the whole-brain analyses (voxel-wise error-rate of   p   < 0.01 with a cluster-threshold correction of 8 voxels). This restriction ensured that the following analyses included only those children who were responding to printed letters in an adult-like manner and resulted in the exclusion of four children, leading to a sample size of 12. See Table   for a complete list of each individual's regions of interest. Note that the peak activity resulting from this contrast did not result in true fusiform activity (as determined by the Talaiach Daemon) in each individual. Nonetheless, we extracted data from these regions for the following reasons: (A) in each individual the peak of activity fell within 5 mm of the fusiform gyrus (as determined by the Talairach Client); (B) given this is functional localization, these regions responded more to print than rest and were within 5 mm of the fusiform gyrus and (C) given co-registration difficulties with children's brain on an adult template, and that visually, the regions appeared to lie within the cortex, we believe that using a 5 mm range is appropriate. \n  \n Peak Talairach coordinates and range for the Regions-of-Interest analyses  . \n  \n  Fusiform gyrus region   . Regions-of-interest were determined by comparing printed letters to rest in a whole-brain comparison in each individual. This contrast was used to reveal the well-known brain regions that respond to letters after a child learns to print, in particular, the bilateral anterior fusiform gyrus (e.g., James,  ; James and Engelhardt,  ), located at the peak coordinates of \u221239, \u221254, \u221215 and 38, \u221254, \u221215. We extracted data from this region that is independent of the contrast used to select the region. Our whole-brain contrasts suggested that there should be an active cursive vs. passive cursive difference in this region, but it is probably a small effect, thus, the ROI analysis can show us a direct comparison with more statistical power. To determine whether or not the cursive letters recruited these regions, we extracted data from individuals from these two ROIs and performed statistical tests on the mean time courses of BOLD activation for the cursive letter conditions. First, we wanted to determine whether the signal in these regions was significantly above baseline, and therefore performed one-sample   t  -tests of each learning condition (active, passive unlearned) against baseline. Results indicated a trend toward significant recruitment above baseline for actively learned letters in the left fusiform gyrus [  t   = 2.02,   p   = 068] (Figure  ) and right fusiform gyrus [  t   = 1.98,   p   = 0.073], (Figure  ) but no other contrasts approached significance. Next, to compare how learning condition affected % BOLD signal change, a 2 (hemisphere) X 3 (Learning condition: active, passive, unlearned) mixed model ANOVA was performed that revealed no significant differences in terms of main effects or interactions, but two interesting trends: One for Learning condition [  F   = 2.7,   p   = 0.09], and another for the Learning X hemisphere interaction [  F   = 2.6,   p   = 0.09]. Keeping in mind the small sample size, we chose to further investigate these trends by performing two One-Way ANOVAs for each hemisphere separately. No effect of learning condition was found in the left fusiform gyrus [  F   = 2.078, n.s.]. However, an effect of learning condition was found in the right fusiform gyrus [  F   = 3.435,   p   < 0.05].   Post-hoc   paired   t  -tests revealed a significant difference between the actively learned letters and the unlearned letters [  t   = 2.369,   p   < 0.05, mean difference of 0.51, SD = 0.75) and between the passively learned letters and the unlearned letters [  t   = 2.511,   p   < 0.05, mean difference of 0.45, SD = 0.64]. No significant difference was found between actively learned letters and passively learned letters [  t   = 2.34, n.s., mean difference of 0.06,   SD   = 0.83] (see Figure  ). In sum, writing letters trended toward significant recruitment of the bilateral fusiform above baseline, while both self-generated active and observed passive writing led to greater recruitment of the right fusiform during subsequent perception in comparison to perception of unlearned letters. \n  \n Region of interest results for the right fusiform (A) and left fusiform (B).   Trends were found for recruitment of the left and right fusiform above baseline in response to perception of actively learned letters. Significant differences in recruitment for perception of actively learned letters and passively learned letters compared to unlearned cursive letters were found in the right fusiform only. Error bars are standard error of the mean. \n  \n  Motor cortex   . Our whole brain contrasts suggested that the left precentral gyrus may be differentially recruited for actively learned vs. passively learned cursive letters as indicated by a trend toward greater recruitment of this region during perception of actively learned letters compared to passively learned ones. This ROI analysis was designed to further investigate this difference. Regions-of-Interest within the motor cortex were identified by contrasting printed letters with rest in a whole-brain comparison for each individual. This resulted in a region-of-interest with peak coordinates of \u221241, \u221216, 59, situated in the left precentral gyrus. All peak coordinates from each individual fell on the left precentral gyrus (see Table  ). To determine how this region responded to the perception of cursive letters after different learning conditions, a One-Way repeated measures ANOVA was performed using each individual's peak motor cortex activation. The ANOVA revealed no effect of learning condition [  F   = 1.093, n.s.]. Planned comparisons were performed to investigate whether any of the learning conditions recruited this region above baseline. One-sample   t  -tests were performed for each learning condition, resulting in a significant difference for actively learned letters from baseline [mean = 0.951,   t   = 3.102,   p   > 0.01], but no effect for passively learned letters [mean = 0.378,   t   = 1.645, n.s.] or unlearned cursive letters compared to baseline [mean = 0.503,   t   = 2.035, n.s.] (see Figure  ). This strengthens our assumption that active learning of letters drives the recruitment of the precentral gyrus during letter perception. \n  \n Region of interest results for the left motor cortex.   Brain map shows individual regions-of-interest superimposed on a typical brain. Graph shows differences among conditions extracted from these regions. Although no differences were found between conditions, only viewing actively learned letters recruited this region significantly above baseline (indicated by asterisk). Error bars are standard error of the mean. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study investigated the role of motor experience in the development of neural networks for cursive letters. Behavioral measures of recognition and neural measures of perception were taken to evaluate how cursive letters were processed after learning relative to printed letters and how active (self-generated) and passive (observed) motor experience influenced these processes. There were several results of interest: First, viewing cursive letters recruited the bilateral fusiform gyrus only when the letters were learned through self-generated action. This finding was shown by our group contrasts (active vs. rest) and by the ROI analysis of the fusiform gyrus. Next, the precentral gyrus was also recruited more for actively learned letters compared to passive observation. Further, the bilateral insula and claustrum were recruited during perception of the letters that children wrote, compared to letters that children observed being written. \n\nInterestingly, no regions were found to be recruited more for cursive letters in comparison to printed ones. This null result is interesting in that it fails to replicate a finding for adults (Longcamp et al.,  ) suggesting that the amount of learning in this study was not sufficient to dissociate the perception of cursive letters from printed letters. \n\nTogether, these results suggest that (A) active learning of cursive letters recruits the same sensori-motor regions in the brain as do printed letters (James,  ; James and Engelhardt,  ); (B) that active learning of cursive letters also recruits additional brain areas more than passive learning of the same stimuli; and (C) that perceiving cursive letters in general does not recruit additional brain areas relative to perceiving printed letters. We will address these conclusions in more detail below. \n\n### Behavioral results \n  \nBehavioral results indicated that children were better at discriminating among cursive letters after the learning session compared to before learning. This is not surprising given that children had no formal training in cursive letters prior to the study and is in line with other studies that found increased recognition abilities after learning a new written stimulus (Longcamp et al.,  ; James and Atwood,  ). However, learning did not differ based on learning condition, suggesting that the neural differences seen in the whole-brain and region-of-interest analyses are a result of training condition rather than superior performance in ability to recognize letters learned in one condition over another. \n\n\n### fMRI results \n  \n#### Self-generated action and the sensori-motor network \n  \n  The fusiform gyrus   . Similar to perceiving printed letters, we show that perceiving cursive letters results in the recruitment of the fusiform gyrus, bilaterally. Further, this finding is more robust (being shown in both whole-brain and ROI analyses) if the letters are learned through self-generated action. This finding replicates and extends our previous work (James,  ; James and Engelhardt,  ) showing that active learning of print stimuli results in the recruitment of letter specific neural processing regions seen in the literate adult. Furthermore, this finding resulted from a very limited learning episode, similar to our findings in James and Engelhardt ( ). We interpret this result as indicating that motor experience with these stimuli enhances\u2014or most certainly changes\u2014subsequent visual processing. There are several reasons why this change may occur. First, motor movements may direct attention to the stimuli being learned, resulting in a more robust visual representation. Second, after a motor movement is learned, a motor program is established that may directly connect to the visual cortex during perception, increasing its recruitment. Third, the act of writing a letter may result in visual information that adds to, or augments, a representation of the visual form that is re-activated upon subsequent perception. The first hypothesis, that motor movements direct greater attention to visual processing, was addressed in previous research that showed that typing, and even tracing letters, did not result in the same sensori-motor recruitment as self-generated action\u2014printing in that case (James and Engelhardt,  ). It is still possible though, that self-generated action drives visual   attention   more than typing or tracing, but we find this interpretation to be somewhat unlikely. The second hypothesis, that the motor program established after writing directly contacts visual processing and serves to change visual-only processing seems also limited because of the finding that tracing (the same motor program) does not enhance visual processing to the same degree as self-generated writing (James and Engelhardt,  ). The third hypothesis, and the one that we favor, is that the output from self-generated handwriting produces variable (messy) stimuli when children produce the form. This output is then processed by the visual system. The perception of the variable forms may serve to broaden perceptual categories, and in turn, enhance visual processing of that stimulus class. We have preliminary evidence that this is the case. When young children are asked to categorize a single form of letter-like stimuli (Greek symbols) vs. variable forms of these same stimuli, their subsequent categorization of the stimuli is facilitated if they practiced categorizing variable or messy, symbols (Li and James, 2013; in preparation). This behavioral evidence, however, does not address the neural hypothesis proposed here and further work is required to address this issue using neuroimaging methods. Perhaps stronger evidence comes from our passively learned letter condition, where experimenters produced the cursive letters for the children to see. In this case, the letters were produced in accordance to the typical cursive font, with little or no variability. Observing these letters did not result in recruitment of the sensori-motor network seen in this, and previous work. In line with this hypothesis are results from a recent study that found suppression in the visual-word form area and its right hemisphere homolog for repeated words written in the same font, suggesting a sensitivity to font in the fusiform (Barton et al.,  ). Because the letters produced in the passive learning condition were written in a consistent handwriting style, this consistency may have suppressed the fusiform during learning, thus inhibiting reactivation of this region above baseline during subsequent perception. In contrast, the actively learned letters were produced with more variability, preventing repetition-suppression from occurring during learning and permitting a more typical pattern of recruitment for letters within the fusiform. However, the idea of this type of sensitivity to font within the fusiform is relatively new and should be interpreted with caution. \n\nInterestingly, comparing learning conditions to   each other   (rather than to baseline or rest) within the left and right fusiform led to differences between conditions only within the right fusiform. Learned letters were found to more strongly recruit this region in comparison to unlearned letters, but there was no difference found between actively and passively learned letters. The fusiform gyri have been implicated in the perception of several stimulus categories including letters, faces, and objects. However, hemispheric differences are typically found based on the particular type of stimulus. The right fusiform, which has been linked with the perception of objects associated with expertise, tends to be recruited for perception of cars and birds (Gauthier et al.,  ), faces (Puce et al.,  ; Kanwisher et al.,  ), and well-learned greebles (Gauthier et al.,  ). In contrast, the left fusiform is typically associated with perception of words (e.g., Joseph et al.,  ,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Cohen and Dehaene,  ; Schlaggar and McCandliss,  ) and letters (e.g., James and Gauthier,  ; James,  ). Despite this traditional lateralization for object perception, the right fusiform has been implicated in letter perception shortly after learning, but only in addition to recruitment of the left fusiform (James and Atwood,  ; James,  ; James and Engelhardt,  ). The hypothesis that early in learning systems are bilateral and then shift to unilateral organization with increased experience has been proposed by several theorists (Johnson,  ; Plaut and Behrmann,  ). Specifically, these theories suggest that the left hemisphere preference for processing words, and perhaps even for letters, is driven by learning to read, which enhances the connections between written words and other language processes (Dehaene et al.,  ; Plaut and Behrmann,  ). Our finding of bilateral fusiform recruitment for children who are still learning to read is in line with these predictions. \n\n  The precentral gyrus   . Two of our results suggest that the left precentral gyrus is important for cursive letter perception after learning with self-generated action. First, our whole brain analysis revealed a trend toward greater recruitment of this area for perception of actively learned cursive letters compared to passively learned ones. Second, our ROI analysis showed that the left precentral gyrus was only recruited above baseline for the actively learned cursive letters, and not for the passively learned or unlearned cursive letters. The left precentral gyrus has been associated with letter perception in several studies and is thought to activate stored motor programs associated with letter production (Longcamp et al.,  ,  ,  ; James and Gauthier,  ; Nakatsuka et al.,  ). This idea is supported by the James and Atwood ( ) results, which found that, in adults, motor experience (writing) with pseudoletters led to recruitment of this region, but when the pseudoletters were learned with only visual practice, the precentral gyrus was not recruited any more so than before learning took place. In this case, motor experience with the pseudoletters was essential for reactivation of the precentral gyrus during later perception. A similar result was shown by James and Engelhardt ( ) that only self-generated printing led to frontal motor system recruitment in preschool children during subsequent letter perception. Another study found that for lefthanders the right precentral gyrus was recruited during perception of printed letters, but not for unlearned pseudoletters, again suggesting that the motor experiences involved in production of letter are essential in order for the precentral gyrus to be recruited during letter perception (Longcamp et al.,  ). This study is particularly telling because the motor activation occurred in the hemisphere contralateral to the hand used to write and only for previously written stimuli, thereby emphasizing the importance of writing experience for the reactivation of this region during perception. The results of the present research add to these findings by showing that passive observation of a letter unfolding over time does not recruit the precentral gyrus above baseline, but production does, thus providing strong evidence for the idea that the motor cortex is only recruited after self-generated action (See also James and Swain,  ). \n\nOne difference seen between this work and previous work is that in a previous study of cursive letters, Exner's area, not the precentral gyrus, was found to be recruited (Nakamura et al.,  ). However, this discrepancy could be attributed to three methodological factors. The first is the use of children vs. adults. It is possible that this response in Exner's area develops with experience reading and writing in cursive script. Thus, the participants in this study would not show this activation. Alternatively, this discrepancy could be due to the use of letters in the present study instead of words as in previous work. This would then suggest that Exner's area is recruited more in response to planning to write whole words rather than individual letters, while the precentral gyrus is where motor plans for individual letters might be processed. Finally, this discrepancy could be driven by the way the stimuli were presented. In the previous study, words were presented with a trajectory that matched how the letters would be written. In the current work, the letters were presented statically. Thus, the activation of Exner's area would be a result of watching the letters unfold rather than seeing static letters appear. This is in line with the previous study in which Exner's area was found to be sensitive to the temporal trajectory of the word. Cursive primes were only able to produce a priming effect in this region when the trajectory of the word was presented in the correct direction (Nakamura et al.,  ). If this is indeed the case, it might be interesting in future studies to explore how children in the beginning stages of learning cursive respond to a similar priming paradigm. \n\n\n#### Additional regions recruited after active learning \n  \nFurther, when we directly compared active to passive learning of cursive letters, greater recruitment of the bilateral insula and claustrum was shown during the perception of actively learned letters than passively learned letters. The left insula has been previously identified as a letter selective region during perception of letters compared to perception of objects (Joseph et al.,  ) and has been associated with letter naming (Joseph et al.,  ). Recruitment of the left insula is typically thought to be reflective of phonological processing (Fujimaki et al.,  ; Borowsky et al.,  ; Joseph et al.,  ). Although no auditory stimuli were presented in this study, it is still possible that the recruitment of the insula seen here is reflective of phonological processing if the children were sub-articulating the letters. Outright articulation is thought to involve the left insula (Baldo et al.,  ), while the right insula has been linked to imagining articulation of phonemes (Kato et al.,  ). Given the recruitment of these regions in the present study, it is possible that following sub-articulation of the letters, children were better able to phonologically process letters that they learned by writing than those that they learned by observing an experimenter write. Further, because the right insula was revealed when comparing printed letters to passively and unlearned cursive letters, but not when comparing printed letters to actively learned cursive letters, this would suggest that writing practice has led to more similar neural representation between printed letters and those letters learned by writing. \n\nAdditionally, the insula and claustrum have been associated with multisensory integration (Hadjikhani and Roland,  ; Naghavi et al.,  ) and postulated to act as a center for coordinating sensory and motor information, both within and across modalities (Crick and Koch,  ). Interestingly, writing itself is a multimodal act that involves sensory input, (i.e., the visual feedback of the letter unfolding and the tactile sensations of holding a pencil or pen and touching paper) and motor execution. In fact, the multimodal aspects of writing reflect the key differences between the active and passive learning conditions in this study, so it would not be surprising if this difference manifests in multimodal integration regions of the brain. Although the task during the scanning session in the present study was not of multimodal nature, it is possible that just as letter perception has been found to activate the motor cortex (James and Gauthier,  ; Longcamp et al.,  ), other areas associated with writing may also be reactivated. As the claustrum has not been implicated in previous imaging studies of writing (James and Gauthier,  ), future studies are warranted to address the specific role of the claustrum during writing. \n\n\n#### Cursive letters and printed letters \n  \nContrary to research findings in adults, the perception of cursive letters did not differentially recruit any brain regions relative to perceiving printed letters in our child participants. The results reported by Longcamp et al. ( ), revealed several regions of the adult brain that were recruited more for handwritten cursive letters than for printed ones, but no regions that were recruited more for printed letters. Several factors likely contribute to this difference in research findings. The first is that adults have had more extensive interactions with cursive letters. Whereas the children in this study had roughly 30 min of experience with the cursive letters, adults likely learned cursive formally in school and may even use cursive on a regular basis. In contrast, 7-year-old children interact with printed letters regularly. All children in this study received a score of at least 12 out of 15 on the printing evaluation and were reading printed words at or above an age-appropriate level, suggesting that these children were quite familiar with printed letters. However, they were only able to identify 56% of cursive letters prior to training. As a result, it is not surprising that perception of printed letters recruited regions more so than perception of cursive letters as children have much more experience with printed letters and specifically, more motor experience. \n\n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nSelf-generated production of cursive letters during learning led to the recruitment of a sensori-motor network known to also be active during letter perception and reading, however, passive observation of a letter being formed did not. This finding adds to the growing literature suggesting that self-generated writing is important for setting up reading networks in the developing brain. Nonetheless, perceiving cursive letters did not affect brain activation any more than perceiving printed letters, suggesting that the motoric production of text stimuli is the crucial factor in creating this network, rather than the type of letter perceived or produced. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any

In addition, a small but growing number of studies has shown that it also contributes to the resolution of response conflicts. It is less clear how these two functions are related, and how they are affected by hippocampal lesions in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Previous studies suggested that conflict stimuli might be better remembered, but whether the hippocampus is critical for supporting this interaction between conflict processing and memory formation is unknown. Here, we tested 19 patients with MTLE due to hippocampal sclerosis and 19 matched healthy controls. Participants performed a face-word Stroop task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) followed by a recognition task for the faces. We tested whether memory performance and activity in brain regions implicated in long-term memory were modulated by conflict during encoding, and whether this differed between MTLE patients and controls. In controls, we largely replicated previous findings of improved memory for conflict stimuli. While MTLE patients showed response time slowing during conflict trials as well, they did not exhibit a memory benefit. In controls, neural activity of conflict resolution and memory encoding interacted within a hippocampal region of interest. Here, left hippocampal recruitment was less efficient for memory performance in incongruent trials than in congruent trials, suggesting an intrahippocampal competition for limited resources. They also showed an involvement of precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex during conflict resolution. Both effects were not observed in MTLE patients, where activation of the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex instead predicted later memory. Further research is needed to find out whether our findings reflect widespread functional reorganization of the episodic memory network due to hippocampal dysfunction. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOnly a small proportion of our experiences is transferred into long-term memory. How long-term memory encoding interacts with cognitive control and which brain areas support their relationship has been studied, but many questions remain ( ;  ). \n\nIn explicit learning tasks, attention improves memory encoding. Conversely, explicit memory performance deteriorates when subjects perform a demanding secondary task ( ;  ). This suggests that cognitive control and memory encoding recruit similar resource-limited neurocognitive processes in frontal and parietal regions ( ). By contrast, in implicit learning tasks, even highly demanding tasks which rely on brain structures that support memory functions may improve memory encoding ( ). For example, a task-switching paradigm caused impaired memory for task-relevant but improved memory for task-irrelevant information ( ). This suggests that memory performance depends on the selectivity of attention, i.e. in the context of task-switching, the ability to maintain a stable task set and to effectively shield the relevant stimuli from distraction. \n\nAn influential theory of conflict monitoring and cognitive control postulates that conflict in information processing signals reinforcement of top-down control of attention to the current task, which helps resolving conflict ( ). This theory further assumes that while the anterior cingulate cortex provides the conflict signal, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) underlies cognitive control mechanisms that enhance attention to task-relevant stimuli ( ). As a result, stimuli that are presented with incongruent distractors should trigger enhanced selective attention and improve memory encoding of the relevant stimulus. We tested this hypothesis in a previous study that combined a face-word Stroop paradigm with a delayed incidental memory task ( ). Trial-unique male and female faces were overlaid with congruent or incongruent distractor words (the words \u201cman\u201d or \u201cwoman\u201d). This study showed that processing incongruent trials elicited behavioral costs (i.e., longer reaction times), but also improved later memory performance for the relevant stimulus. Conflicts induced activation of a common cognitive control network, including dlPFC and precuneus, and recruitment of these areas was associated with a memory benefit for face stimuli in conflict trials. Furthermore, functional coupling between these areas and the medial temporal lobe was associated with improved memory of incongruent items. These results suggest that prefrontal and parietal brain regions support control processes and exert a top-down modulation of hippocampus mediated memory encoding, highlighting the hippocampus as a crucial link between response conflict resolution and memory encoding. \n\nIn a series of studies, we recently investigated the role of the hippocampus in higher-order cognitive control processes such as response conflict resolution. We found that in healthy participants, the left hippocampus is recruited during the resolution of response conflicts ( ). Patients with a mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) due to hippocampal sclerosis had an impaired conflict resolution performance ( ). In these patients, we further observed a reduced recruitment of the left hippocampus that contributed to the deterioration in performance ( ). These studies suggest that the hippocampus is indeed required for the resolution of cognitive response conflicts. However, whether and how these effects relate to the memory function of the hippocampus remains unclear. Specifically, it is still an open question whether hippocampal dysfunction in MTLE patients affects the interaction between conflict resolution and memory encoding. \n\nHere, we employed the previously established paradigm by   in MTLE patients and healthy controls to further explore the interaction between conflict resolution processes and memory encoding. First, we tested whether stimuli that evoke a response conflict are subsequently better remembered than control stimuli in a delayed incidental memory task and whether this effect differs between controls and MTLE patients. If cognitive control mechanisms recruited during response conflict resolution promote memory encoding ( ) and MTLE patients exhibit reduced conflict resolution performance ( ), one would expect them to also show a reduced memory benefit for conflict stimuli. Second, we tested whether brain regions recruited during response conflict resolution predicted subsequent memory performance. In our previous study, we found increased functional coupling between prefrontal and parietal conflict processing regions on the one hand and the medial temporal lobe on the other hand in healthy participants ( ) which we interpreted as a top-down modulation of hippocampal memory encoding. In the present study, applying the same paradigm in healthy controls and hippocampus-lesioned patients allowed us to test whether conflict processing specifically provided by the hippocampus further contributes to improved subsequent memory performance. We predicted that a reduced conflict-induced hippocampal recruitment due to medial temporal lobe dysfunction affects the memory benefit for conflict stimuli. We further explored whether functional connectivity of the hippocampus differs between MTLE patients and healthy controls. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \n N  \u00a0=\u00a022 patients with MTLE according to International League Against Epilepsy criteria ( ) participated in the study. These patients are identical with those from our previous study ( ). Two patients were excluded from the study due to their extremely low accuracies in the Stroop task. One additional patient did not remember any faces and was excluded as well. The final group consisted of 19 patients (age: 45.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.7 years; 8 females; age at seizure onset: 29.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.2 years; disease duration: 15.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.5 years). All patients underwent neurological examination, EEG and structural MRI as part of their clinical diagnostic procedure. Based on EEG and seizure semiology, 17 patients were diagnosed with unilateral MTLE (left MTLE:   n  \u00a0=\u00a07; right MTLE:   n  \u00a0=\u00a010), two patients had a bilateral MTLE. Nine patients received antiepileptic drug (AED) monotherapy, 10 patients were on polytherapy (for AED dosages, please see supplemental patient characteristics in Table S1). Patients with multifocal epilepsy, comorbid neurological diseases or severe psychiatric disorders were excluded. \n\nIn addition to patients,   n  \u00a0=\u00a019 age matched healthy controls participated in the study (age: 45.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.5 years; 9 females). Subjects with a neurological or psychiatric disease, a central nervous system-active medication or cerebral lesions were excluded. \n\nAll participants gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the \u00c4rztekammer Westfalen-Lippe and University of Muenster (reference 2016 - 004 - f - S). \n\nAs described previously ( ) the structural MRI scans received concordant evaluations by two radiologists following a standardized protocol to assess signs of hippocampal sclerosis ( ). Healthy subjects did not show any signs of hippocampal sclerosis. In MTLE patients, radiological findings of individual MRI scans are described in the Supplemental Results (Table S1). Results of the volumetric analyses confirmed the qualitative findings of the radiologists with respect to the lateralization of the hippocampal lesion (see Supplemental Results, Table S3). \n\n\n### Experimental procedure \n  \nThe participants underwent functional MRI scanning using an adapted version of the face-word Stroop paradigm from a previous fMRI study ( ). This version of the task featured conflict and non-conflict trials, but no neutral trials (faces overlaid with an unrelated word) in order to reduce overall memory demands for this sample including patients. \n\n#### Familiarization and training \n  \nPrior to the MRI session, the participants performed a familiarization task for all face stimuli that were later presented in the face-word Stroop task. A pre-exposure to the stimuli of the fMRI task appeared necessary for two reasons. First, MTLE patients are significantly impaired in episodic memory ( ). We aimed to avoid floor effects and moreover to equalize baseline levels so that conflict modulation can be observed. Second, as there is an habituation of hippocampal response to novelty ( ), a familiarization phase avoids group differences for this effect. How pre-exposure may further affect interpretation will be addressed in the discussion. \n\nDuring familiarization, the face stimuli were displayed three times in a randomized order for 2000\u00a0ms each with a stimulus-onset-asynchrony (SOA) of 3000\u00a0ms. This procedure was chosen to avoid effects of novelty and floor effects during the later memory task. To ensure continuous attention, subjects had to indicate (via left vs. right button-press) whether they had seen the current face before or not. Stimuli were shown in the center of a white screen, and a black fixation dot was presented throughout the entire task. After familiarization, participants performed 20 separate training trials of the face-word Stroop task. These stimuli were different from those presented in the fMRI task. \n\n\n#### Face-word Stroop task \n  \nThe task comprised face-word stimuli consisting of male and female faces [Glasgow Face Database,  ], overlaid by the words \u201cman\u201d or \u201cwoman\u201d (in German language). These words could be either congruent or incongruent with the sex of the face ( A). The paradigm consisted of the 120 faces (60 males and 60 females) previously presented in the familiarization task. Faces were displayed for 1500\u00a0ms in the center of a white screen. We used an event-related design in order to identify separate trial-related Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses. Trial onsets randomly varied with a pseudo-exponentially distributed SOA of 5000\u00a0ms (75%), 7500\u00a0ms (17%) and 10,000\u00a0ms (8%). The words were displayed in red ink superimposed on the faces. Both trial types were presented in a randomized order and occurred with a probability of 50%. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two stimulus sets. Stimuli that were congruent in one group of subjects were incongruent in the other group. Subjects had to indicate whether a face was male or female by pressing the left or right mouse button (button assignments were counterbalanced across participants in each group). Throughout the entire paradigm, a black fixation dot was displayed in the middle of the face (and right below the word) to ensure accurate fixation.   \nFace-word Stroop task and behavioral results. (A) In the face-word Stroop task, each trial consisted of a face overlaid by the words \u201cman\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d that were either congruent or incongruent with the sex of the face. ITI, inter-trial interval. (B) Mean of response times (left) and mean of response time differences (right), overlaid with single-subject results. (C) Mean of the response accuracies (left) and response accuracy differences (right), overlaid with single-subject results. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n#### Incidental memory task \n  \nAbout 30\u201345\u00a0min after the face-word Stroop task, an incidental memory task of to the previously seen faces was conducted outside of the MRI scanner. All 120 faces that had been shown in the face-word Stroop task and 40 novel faces were presented in a random order on a standard laptop computer. The faces were displayed in the center of a white screen for 2000\u00a0ms, followed by an inter-trial interval of 2000\u00a0ms (SOA\u00a0=\u00a04000\u00a0ms). Subjects were asked to indicate whether they had seen the face before (during the fMRI task or the familiarization) or not by pressing one of four buttons (4: \u201cdefinitely old\u201d, 3: \u201cprobably old\u201d, 2: \u201cprobably new\u201d, 1: \u201cdefinitely new\u201d). We tested whether this rating scale was used differently by MTLE patients and healthy controls to exclude the possibility of strategic differences. In the supplement, Fig. S1 shows the number of responses for each response category, separately for target items and distractor items as well as for controls and MTLE patients. In a multivariate ANOVA, \u201cgroup\u201d (MTLE patients vs. controls) did not affect the number of responses for the different response categories (Pillai's Trace;   V  \u00a0=\u00a00.2,   F   (8, 29)\u00a0=\u00a01.0,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.45), arguing against a differential use of the rating scale in both groups. \n\n\n\n### MR image acquisition \n  \nMR images were collected using a 3T Achieva Philips MR scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, NL) equipped with a six-channel head coil. During the face-word Stroop task, a total of 294 T2*-weighted gradient echo-planar images (EPI) were acquired (TR\u00a0=\u00a02500\u00a0ms; TE\u00a0=\u00a035\u00a0ms; 36 axial slices; interleaved acquisition in ascending direction; FOV\u00a0=\u00a0230\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0230\u00a0mm ; matrix\u00a0=\u00a064\u00a0\u00d7\u00a063; slice-thickness\u00a0=\u00a03.6\u00a0mm; no interslice gap; flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0). The first 6 vol were discarded. The imaging volumes were tilted upwards by 15\u00b0 from the AC-PC-plane in order to reduce distortions and signal dropouts in the anterior temporal lobes. \n\nAdditionally, an anatomical 3D T1-weighted (T1w) turbo field echo (TFE) sequence (repetition time [TR]\u00a0=\u00a07.4\u00a0ms; echo time [TE]\u00a0=\u00a03.4\u00a0ms; inversion time [TI]\u00a0=\u00a0900\u00a0ms; flip angle\u00a0=\u00a09\u00b0; 176 slices; matrix\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0224; field of view [FOV]\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0224\u00a0mm ; slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mm) was acquired. To investigate changes in medial temporal lobe structures, paracoronal T2-weighted (T2w) images perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampi were acquired using a turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence (TR\u00a0=\u00a05196\u00a0ms; TE\u00a0=\u00a0118\u00a0ms; parallel imaging factor [SENSE]\u00a0=\u00a01.5; turbo factor\u00a0=\u00a026; 38 slices; FOV\u00a0=\u00a0200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0200mm ; acquisition matrix\u00a0=\u00a0372\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0312; slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0mm; slice gap\u00a0=\u00a00.2\u00a0mm). \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Behavioral data \n  \nMean response times (RT), including only correct responses, and accuracy of responses in the face-word Stroop task were analyzed with two-way mixed analyses of variances (ANOVAs) with \u201ccongruency\u201d (incongruent vs. congruent) as a within-subject factor and \u201cgroup\u201d (healthy controls vs. MTLE patients) as a between-subjects factor. \n\nMemory performance was analyzed as follows. First, we sought to replicate the previous finding of conflict-enhanced memory. As in our previous study, we contrasted the number of \u201cdefinitely old\u201d (remembered) with all other ratings (forgotten) for target stimuli, reflecting a high confident recognition measure (putatively mainly based on recollection). In an additional analysis, we counted previously presented stimuli rated as either \u201cdefinitely old\u201d or \u201cprobably old\u201d as remembered, and faces rated as \u201cprobably new\u201d and \u201cdefinitely new\u201d as forgotten, reflecting a more global measure of both recollection and familiarity. We also assessed false alarm rates (distractor items rates as \u201cdefinitely old\u201d or \u201cprobably old\u201d). In all analyses, two-way mixed ANOVAs were conducted to investigate main effects of congruency and group as well as their interaction. \n\nWe additionally analyzed response times for remembered target stimuli (\u201cdefinitely old\u201d and \u201cprobably old\u201d). These results are presented in the supplement. \n\nWe also tested for correlations between Stroop task performance and retrieval rates using non-parametric Kendall's tau, as this parameter is particularly suitable for small groups analyses. We corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction (p-value/2). The results are presented in the supplement. \n\n\n#### FMRI data preprocessing and analysis \n  \nThe fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12; University College, London, UK) using the same procedure as applied previously ( ). In short, functional EPIs were realigned, normalized, resliced and smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with 8\u00a0mm FWHM. We verified the accuracy of normalization in patients with the greatest abnormalities in the medial temporal lobe. Correction of normalization parameters was not necessary. \n\nBased on our a-priori hypothesis that conflict-induced memory improvement is directly mediated by hippocampal recruitment, in the fMRI analysis, we focused on the effects of congruency and the interaction between congruency and memory within a hippocampal ROI. If significant, we further report main effects of memory and group as well as the interaction \u201ccongruency x memory x group\u201d. To not miss any effects outside the hippocampus, we also tested for these effects in a whole-brain analysis. \n\nIn follow-up analyses, we extracted beta-values from significant activation clusters and performed within and between group comparisons, respectively. Please note that such post-hoc comparisons are not corrected for multiple comparisons. They are presented for illustrative purposes and they do not allow inferences. \n\nThe first level general linear model (GLM) included four regressors (and their temporal derivates) related to the experimental conditions and six movement regressors derived from the realignment procedure. Due to the overall high memory performance, the experimental conditions (congruent, incongruent) were divided into trials with faces that were recollected with high confidence vs. faces that were not recollected with high confidence. \n\nThus, in the fMRI analysis, we contrasted stimuli rated as \u201cdefinitely old\u201d with all other ratings, corresponding to an fMRI measure that is putatively mainly based on recollection, as in our previous study ( ). In the supplement, we also report fMRI results based on first-level models in which we contrasted remembered (\u201cdefinitely old\u201d and \u201cprobably old\u201d) with forgotten (\u201cprobably new\u201d and \u201cdefinitely new\u201d) items. \n\nFirst-level individual contrast images for each of the four experimental conditions were entered into random-effects second-level analyses for the two groups (healthy controls vs. MTLE patients). We applied flexible factorial designs to investigate main effects of \u201ccongruency\u201d (incongruent vs. congruent), \u201cmemory\u201d (recollected with high confidence vs. not recollected with high confidence) and the interaction (congruency x memory) within each group. Additionally, the contrast images from controls and MTLE patients were entered into a common GLM (flexible factorial design) to test for a main effect of \u201cgroup\u201d and for interactions of the two within-subject factors \u201ccongruency\u201d and \u201cmemory\u201d with the between-subjects factor \u201cgroup\u201d (group x congruency, group x memory). \n\nVoxel activations were identified at an initial cluster-forming threshold of   p   < 0.001 and family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level (for whole-brain analyses) or at the voxel-level (for hippocampal ROI analyses), respectively. In the hippocampal ROI analysis, we performed small volume correction for a ROI containing left and right hippocampus as defined by the Automatic Anatomic Labeling (AAL) atlas ( ). In this analysis, MTLE patients with amygdalohippocampectomy were excluded. For the interpretation of activations, we subdivided the hippocampus into an anterior (\u00a0Y \u2265 -21\u00a0mm MNI) and a posterior (Y \u2264 -22\u00a0mm MNI) part ( ). \n\n\n#### Functional connectivity analyses \n  \nWe performed exploratory functional connectivity analyses using the CONN toolbox V18.b ( , RRID:SCR_009550). Functional images were preprocessed using SPM and corrected for noise using the default denoising pipeline ( ). In addition to temporal band-pass filtering (0.008 \u2013 0.09\u00a0Hz), the procedure included linear regression of confounding factors, i.e. effects of no interest from white matter, cerebrospinal fluid and movements (realignment parameters). \n\nThe functional connectivity analysis was a seed-based connectivity measure (seed to voxel) based on bivariate correlational analyses during the task (averaging congruent and incongruent trials). We chose two anatomical seed regions, i.e. left and right hippocampus, based on the ROI in the univariate analysis. First-level connectivity maps representing z-transformed correlation coefficients in the BOLD signal between the seed and each voxel in the brain were entered into a second-level ANOVA, allowing us to investigate differences of hippocampal connectivity between MTLE patients and controls. The statistical threshold was identical to that used in the univariate fMRI analysis (i.e.   p   < 0.05; FWE-corrected at the cluster level with an initial cluster-forming voxel threshold of   p   < 0.001). Analysis and results of regional brain volumes are described in the supplement. \n\n\n\n### Data and code availability \n  \nGroup-level statistical maps are accessible under the following link:  . Behavioral data can be made available via data sharing agreement upon request to the corresponding author. \n\nSoftware used in this study is openly available. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \n#### Face-word Stroop task \n  \nThe results of the Stroop task are shown in  B,C. \n\nWith respect to RT, a mixed ANOVA revealed significant main effects of \u201ccongruency\u201d (incongruent vs. congruent; F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a044.3;   p   < 0.001) and \u201cgroup\u201d (MTLE patients vs controls; F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a04.7;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.037) as well as a significant interaction (group x congruency; F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a04.6;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.039). RT slowing in incongruent compared to congruent trials was found in both healthy subjects (t(18)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22125.4;   p   < 0.001) and MTLE patients (t(18)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22123.9;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.001), confirming robust interference effects in our paradigm. Comparing patients with left MTLE and patients with right MTLE, a mixed ANOVA did neither reveal a main effect of group (F(1,15) < 0.001;   p  \u00a0=\u00a01.0) nor an interaction (group x congruency; F(1,15)\u00a0=\u00a00.01;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.9). \n\nFor response accuracy, a mixed ANOVA showed no significant main effects (congruency: F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a00.5;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.46; group: F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a02.5;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.12) or interaction (group x congruency; F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a00.5;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.51). A mixed ANOVA comparing left and right MTLE patients did not yield a significant main effect of group (F(1,15)\u00a0=\u00a00.4;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.6). \n\nIn sum, in both groups, responses were significantly slower in incongruent trials while accuracy was unaffected. The results indicate conflict effects in both controls and MTLE patients, providing the basis for testing whether memory performance is modulated by conflict-related control processes. \n\n\n#### Incidental delayed memory task \n  \nRetrieval rates are presented in  . Before analysis, we excluded all error trials and misses in the face-word Stroop task. The number of analyzed items did not differ between controls (97%) and MTLE patients (93%; t(36)\u00a0=\u00a01.79;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.082). Notably, false alarm rates (new faces rated as \u201cdefinitely old\u201d or \u201cprobably old\u201d) did not differ between MTLE patients (33%) and controls (34%; t(36)\u00a0=\u00a00.1;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.9).   \nBehavioral results of the retrieval task. (A) Distribution of retrieval ratings. (B) Relative retrieval rates (\u201cdefinitely old\u201d and \u201cprobably old\u201d) and difference scores (incongruent - congruent), overlaid with single-subject results. \n  Fig. 2   \n\nWe first tested whether stimulus congruency (incongruent vs. congruent) influenced the number of high confident recognition responses for target stimuli, i.e., faces rated as \u201cdefinitely old\u201d. A mixed ANOVA yielded a significant main effect of \u201cgroup\u201d (healthy controls vs. MTLE patients; F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a07.0;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.012) and a trend for an interaction (group x congruency; F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a03.0;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.092) but no significant main effect of conflict (F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a00.2;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.9). Thus, MTLE patients reached lower high confident recognition scores than healthy controls. This was true for both congruent (t(18)\u00a0=\u00a02.1;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.046) and incongruent trials (t(18)\u00a0=\u00a03.2;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.003). Within groups, high confident recognition scores did not differ between congruent and incongruent trials in either controls (t(18)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.3;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.21) or MTLE patients (t(18)\u00a0=\u00a01.2;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.25). Retrieval rates did not differ between right and left MTLE patients (main effect of group: F(1,15)\u00a0=\u00a02.6;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.13) and were independent of congruency (interaction: F(1,15) < 0.1;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.8). \n\nIn a complementary analysis, stimuli were counted as remembered when rated as either \u201cdefinitely old\u201d or \u201cprobably old\u201d (reflecting a low confidence recognition measure and possibly reflecting familiarity). In a mixed ANOVA of this more global memory measure, MTLE patients reached lower scores (main effect of group;   F  (1,36)\u00a0=\u00a06.6;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.015) and the interaction between \u201cgroup\u201d and \u201ccongruency\u201d was significant (  F  (1,36)\u00a0=\u00a05.0;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.032). This indicates that word congruency modulated memory differently in healthy controls and MTLE patients when considering a more global measure of memory. Specifically, healthy controls showed improved retrieval of faces from incongruent compared to congruent trials in healthy controls (81.6% vs. 77.6%;   t  (18)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.5;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.021). By contrast, MTLE patients did not show such memory benefit of incongruent stimuli (65% vs. 66%;   t  (18)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.7;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.5). In incongruent trials, retrieval rates were significantly higher for controls than MTLE patients (  t  (38)\u00a0=\u00a03.0;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.005), while this difference only reached a trend for congruent trials (  t  (30.5)\u00a0=\u00a02.0;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.052). \n\nIn sum, incongruent distractor words in the face-word Stroop task caused typical behavioral costs in terms of RT slowing in both healthy controls and MTLE patients, but familiarity-based recognition scores increased during conflict only in healthy controls. \n\n\n\n### FMRI results \n  \n#### Main effect of congruency \n  \n ROI analysis in the hippocampus  : In line with our main hypothesis and previous work ( ;  ), we first analyzed congruency effects in a ROI consisting of bilateral hippocampus. In healthy controls, we found a small but significant activation increase for incongruent vs. congruent trials in both left posterior hippocampus (MNI \u221230/\u221224/\u221216,   Z  \u00a0=\u00a03.74, p(FWE)\u00a0=\u00a00.036; cluster size\u00a0=\u00a01) and right posterior hippocampus (MNI 28/\u221236/\u22124,   Z  \u00a0=\u00a03.72, p(FWE)\u00a0=\u00a00.038; cluster size\u00a0=\u00a01). No effect in the reverse direction was observed in the hippocampus. In MTLE patients, the same analysis did not reveal a main effect of congruency in the hippocampus. In a mixed ANOVA with MTLE patients and controls, we did neither find main effects of congruency or group nor an interaction (group x congruency) within the hippocampus ROI. \n\n Whole-brain analysis  : In healthy controls, we found several significant clusters of increased activity during incongruent trials (including bilateral insula, bilateral supplementary motor area and cingulate cortex, left precentral gyrus, bilateral middle frontal gyrus, precuneus, caudate nucleus, left putamen;  ,  A). No clusters showed a reverse effect. These clusters largely replicate results of our previous study ( ) and are typical findings in cognitive tasks that require behavioral inhibition ( ).   \nActivation clusters in controls (main effect of congruency). \n  Table 1       \nWhole brain analysis of activations related to response conflict.

A mixed ANOVA including controls and patients showed a significant group x congruency interaction in the precuneus spreading to the PCC (MNI peak coordinates: \u22124/\u221258/38; cluster size\u00a0=\u00a0182;   p  (FWE)\u00a0=\u00a00.048;  B). This interaction indicates a reduced conflict-induced activation increase in MTLE patients compared to controls. Post-hoc paired t-tests in this interaction cluster showed increased activation during incongruent relative to congruent trials in healthy subjects (  t  (18)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22124.5;   p   < 0.001) but not in MTLE patients (  t  (18)\u00a0=\u00a01.1;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.27;  C). \n\nIn sum, we found conflict-related activations in an extended frontoparietal network in healthy controls and reduced effects in MTLE patients. \n\n\n#### Subsequent memory effects \n  \n ROI analysis in the hippocampus  : In healthy controls, we did not observe a significant main effect of memory in bilateral hippocampi in an ANOVA with the within-subject factors \u201ccongruency\u201d (congruent vs. incongruent) and \u201cmemory\u201d (recollected with high confidence vs. not recollected with high confidence). Interestingly, however, we found a significant congruency x memory interaction with a peak in the left posterior hippocampus (MNI peak coordinates \u221232/\u221224/\u221216;   Z  \u00a0=\u00a03.81; p(FWE)\u00a0=\u00a00.028; cluster size\u00a0=\u00a04;  A), spreading into anterior hippocampus (max/min Y(mm): \u221220/\u221224). This cluster, which comprises only voxels surviving voxel-level FWE-correction within the hippocampal ROI, was directly adjacent to the area where we found conflict-related activation increase (MNI peak coordinates: \u221230/\u221224/\u221216).   \nBOLD activity related to subsequent memory performance.

In MTLE patients, neither the main effect of memory nor the interaction (congruency x memory) revealed significant activations within the hippocampal ROI. \n\nIn sum, in controls, hippocampal activation was associated with greater memory benefits for faces from congruent trials compared to faces from incongruent trials. \n\n Whole-brain analysis  : We next tested whether other brain regions were predictive of memory success. In healthy controls, the whole-brain analysis did not reveal any activation cluster with either a main effect of memory or an interaction (congruency x memory). \n\nIn MTLE patients, we found an activation cluster comprising the PCC and the precuneus (MNI peak coordinates: 0/\u221252/22, cluster size\u00a0=\u00a0182,   p  (FWE)\u00a0=\u00a00.022,  C) that showed a main effect of memory but no interaction with congruency. \n\nPost-hoc t-tests of the extracted beta values revealed that activation was increased during encoding of later remembered compared to forgotten faces from both congruent (t(18)\u00a0=\u00a02.9   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.01) and incongruent trials (t(18)\u00a0=\u00a03.7   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.002;  D). \n\nThe results indicate that the PCC/precuneus contributed to later memory success in MTLE patients independent of congruency. \n\n\n\n### Functional connectivity results \n  \nWe investigated functional connectivity between activations in hippocampal seeds and each voxel in the brain. For the left hippocampal seed, functional connectivity (over tasks) did not differ between groups. However, MTLE patients showed significantly decreased coupling between right hippocampus and right PCC compared to healthy subjects (MNI 12/\u221244/30; cluster size\u00a0=\u00a0197,   p  (FWE)\u00a0=\u00a00.004;  ). The analysis did not reveal a significant interaction (group x congruency).   \nResults of functional connectivity analysis for the right hippocampal seed.

Using a previously established face-word Stroop paradigm and an incidental memory task, we tested whether the conflict-induced memory benefit that we had found in healthy subjects ( ) was reduced in MTLE patients. Moreover, we investigated whether recruitment of the hippocampus or other conflict-related brain regions is necessary for a memory benefit of conflict stimuli. \n\nWhile both MTLE patients and healthy controls showed behavioral costs of conflict processing in the Stroop task, only healthy controls exhibited improved memory for incongruent items. Conflict processing was associated with activation of bilateral hippocampus, precuneus and PCC in healthy controls. Conflict-related activation of precuneus and PCC was significantly reduced in MTLE patients compared to controls. Furthermore, activation of precuneus and PCC instead predicted subsequent memory in MTLE patients. Interestingly, in healthy controls, left hippocampal activation was less efficient for memory encoding in case of conflict compared to non-conflict, a seemingly counterintuitive activation pattern. \n\nIn contrast to the auditory Stroop task in our previous studies ( a,  b), in the face-word Stroop task, MTLE patients showed normal response accuracy and increased RT in congruent but not incongruent trials. This discrepancy may be related to the difference between the tasks: Compared to naming the pitch of a tone (as in our previous study), decisions on the sex of a face are more complex and require integrating various kinds of information. As   already stated, this might have attenuated effects of conflict on behavioral measures and also explain why the present results do not perfectly match with our previous findings. \n\nPrevious studies found that the processing of incongruent items improved subsequent memory ( ;  ). Recently,   showed that memory was only enhanced for those incongruent items that were presented after another incongruent trial. These contradictory findings might be explained by different trial orders of congruent and incongruent trials and/or different Stroop trials that were selected for the later memory task. In the present study, the behavioral results in healthy participants indicate a memory benefit for incongruent items, but only when adapting a more global memory measure including high and low confident recognition. Thus, conflict-induced memory benefit seems to depend on task features such as trial composition or which kind of recognition measure is used. \n\nImportantly, no such memory benefit was found in MTLE patients. More specifically, MTLE patients showed reduced memory particularly for incongruent items. As we found impairments of response conflict resolution during an auditory Stroop task in an MTLE patient cohort largely overlapping with the current sample ( ), one may assume that the decreased memory benefit relates to reduced conflict resolution performance of patients. \n\nBased on our previous finding of a reduced conflict-related left hippocampus recruitment in MTLE patients ( ), we hypothesized that the hippocampus itself might contribute to improved memory encoding of incongruent items. Indeed, we found a significant interaction between memory and congruency in the left posterior hippocampus in healthy controls. However, hippocampal activation was actually less pronounced for encoding items from incongruent trials compared to congruent trials. This cluster was close to the region showing conflict-related activation in this study as well as in our previous study that used an auditory Stroop paradigm ( ). This suggests that recruiting the hippocampus for the resolution of response conflicts interferes with its role in memory formation. This finding was unexpected since previous fMRI results found posterior hippocampal recruitment during encoding of repeated stimuli ( ). One explanation might be that it reflects a competition for limited resources between two functions that are both hippocampus-dependent. A similar competition for neural resources in prefrontal cortex has previously been suggested as an explanation for lower memory encoding during a demanding secondary task ( ). Furthermore, converging evidence from animal lesion studies and human fMRI recordings suggest that multiple simultaneously activated memory systems interact in a bidirectionally competitive way ( ). For example, disruption of hippocampal function in rodents enhanced striatal instrumental learning ( ;  ). The theory of a hippocampal competition is also in line with human neuroimaging studies showing that the type of representation that is used for memory or spatial navigation (hippocampal or striatal mediated) affects both performance and activation ( ;  ). \n\nAlternative explanations for the counterintuitive activation pattern in the hippocampus should be taken into account. Considering that participants had performed a familiarization task before the main experiment, it might be plausible that they did not only encode information during the Stroop task but also retrieved the previously presented items, leading to a competition between encoding and retrieval. This notion is supported by evidence suggesting that encoding and retrieval cannot occur at the same time and, again, compete for limited resources ( ;  ). Thus, an increased recruitment of the posterior part of the hippocampus might reflect retrieval success ( ), leading to reduced memory encoding. This interpretation would be in line with the notion that encoding of familiar or repeated stimuli (possibly due to a retrieval component) more strongly relies on posterior hippocampus ( ;  ;  ). Nevertheless, since healthy subjects showed an improved memory for conflict-related stimuli, neural activity in other brain regions must have had an even greater impact on memory encoding. \n\nWe further tested whether activation of other, possibly connected, brain areas could account for the behavioral results. Healthy controls exhibited conflict-related activation clusters in prefrontal and parietal brain regions, largely in line with the results of our previous study ( ). More specifically, activations in the lateral and medial PFC are thought to mediate conflict monitoring and conflict resolution ( ;  ). From a network perspective, controls\u2019 bilateral activation in the anterior insula suggest an involvement of the salience network ( ). This might represent the neural signal which initiates a switch from default mode activity to cognitive control activity ( ). Posterior midline regions, particularly the precuneus, are also involved in cognitive control processes, probably through their role in directing attention ( ;  ). Conflict-related activation in the precuneus and partly the PCC was significantly reduced in MTLE patients. Notably, these functional changes in the recruitment of precuneus/PCC of MTLE patients were not reflected by volumetric changes in these areas (see Supplemental Results, Table S3). The results are largely in line, however, with our functional connectivity results that revealed decreased coupling between the right hippocampal seed and right PCC ( ). This finding is consistent with previous studies showing extratemporal functional changes in MTLE patients, particularly in regions involved in the default mode network (DMN;  ;  ), and, more specifically, a decoupling between hippocampus and other parts of the DMN ( ;  ;  ). \n\nThe reduced effects of congruency mainly in the precuneus and partly the PCC in MTLE patients compared to healthy controls are in line with the behavioral finding that congruency modulated memory performance in controls but not in MTLE patients. However, can functional changes in the precuneus/PCC indeed explain the reduced memory benefit for conflict stimuli in MTLE patients? Precuneus and also PCC have been suggested to be core nodes of the DMN which is active in the absence of a task and associated with internally directed cognition ( ). In contrast, other studies argued against an involvement of the precuneus in the DMN ( ;  ). It is likely that there is a functional differentiation within precuneus and PCC. Whereas the ventral precuneus and ventral PCC (corresponding to Brodmann areas 29/30) shows integration in the DMN, the dorsal precuneus (or Brodmann area 7) and dorsal PCC are more strongly related to brain areas of motor execution and cognitive control ( ;  ,  ). In MTLE patients, functional changes in the precuneus did not show clear restriction to either ventral or dorsal precuneus. Thus, interpretation on the level of functional networks seems equivocal. Instead, there is convincing evidence for a crucial role of the precuneus in episodic memory ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The idea that the role of the precuneus in episodic memory explains the reduced conflict-related memory benefit in MTLE patients is in line with the finding in our previous study that the precuneus was predictive of a conflict-induced memory benefit ( ). Moreover, and most importantly, we found a distinct activation cluster comprising parts of the PCC and the precuneus which predicted retrieval success independent of congruency in MTLE patients. Notably, the precuneus is more strongly related to memory retrieval ( ) which is in line with the idea that subjects did not only encode but also retrieved the faces they had been familiarized before. Functional impairment in the precuneus due to hippocampal damage might reflect (presumably) maladaptive reorganization of memory processes from hippocampus to posterior midline regions which might contribute to episodic memory impairment and deficits in their modulation by cognitive control. This is largely in line with a previous study showing that functional changes in the posterior cingulum were related to memory performance ( ). We speculate that due to changes in precuneus recruitment, memory recall was not modulated by congruency in MTLE patients, leading to similar (additional) encoding efficiency in both trial types. \n\nFrom a broader perspective, the present findings are relevant with regard to a related research line on hippocampal involvement during approach-avoidance conflicts (for review, see  ). For instance, it has been shown that behavioral adaptations in an approach-avoidance conflict paradigm, and in particular the avoidance of threats, was associated with larger activity in the anterior hippocampus of healthy participants ( ). Crucially, behavioral adaptation was impaired in TLE patients, and this did not merely reflect general memory impairments (based on neuropsychological assessment). Moreover, in a recent study, patients with a mesial temporal lobe lesion were impaired in approach-avoidance decision-making but showed recollection of threat memory similar to controls ( ). These findings suggest that hippocampal involvement during approach-avoidance conflict tasks is not necessarily related to memory. In how far hippocampal activity during these particular conflicts is directly contributing to long-term memory is, however, a matter of debate. Specifically, a recent behavioral study ( ) did not find memory improvements in an approach-avoidance conflict task. This is not only challenging the above view, but is also inconsistent with our previous ( ) and current findings in the face-word Stroop task. As discussed by  , this behavioral discrepancy might be explained by differences in the task design (i.e., presence vs. absence of incentive valence; associative vs. item memory) and a ceiling effect due to pre-exposure. Moreover, the interpretation of hippocampal involvement in approach-avoidance conflict tasks is complicated by the incentive valence dimension, which is known to modulate memory formation via the hippocampus ( ). Together, the diverse set of results across different studies and domains support the notion that the hippocampus has a role in both (approach-avoidance) conflict processing and conflict-based memory formation, but the exact relationship between these processes seems to depend on the nature of the paradigm. In the light of this discussion, our observation that hippocampal lesions abolish conflict-induced memory improvements might indicate that an active hippocampus during conflict processing indirectly enhances memory encoding by allowing the conflict-related recruitment of other brain regions, such as the precuneus. \n\nIn the present study, we found reduced BOLD signal in several brain regions in MTLE patients. As patients showed altered conflict-modulation of memory, we interpreted changes of the activation pattern as a dysfunctional process. This is in line with the majority of previous studies showing that activation changes represent a pathological process or an inefficient compensatory attempt in TLE ( ). The situation is even more complex because the BOLD signal depends on neurovascular coupling between neural activity and blood oxygenation (and volume), and this coupling may be substantially altered in epilepsy. Specifically, in epilepsy patients, interictal epileptiform discharges can affect the BOLD signal and thus lead to deviations from linearity in neurovascular coupling ( ;  ). In our study, we reduced the impact of this confound by testing the group differences in the relative activations between two conditions (congruent vs. incongruent). Nevertheless, future studies which allow for a direct measurement of neural activity such as intracranial EEG recordings should be conducted with the same paradigm, ideally after running the experiment via fMRI before electrode implantation. \n\nOur study has several limitations. Our main behavioral outcome measures of the Stroop task were RT and accuracy which we analyzed separately. The results show that RT was clearly modulated by conflict, while accuracy was not affected (ceiling effect), neither in controls nor in patients. This indicates that the present conflict manipulation did not evoke a substantial number of response errors (a reflection of automatic response capture by the irrelevant stimulus), but led to significantly prolonged RTs (a reflection of cognitive control processes to prevent response errors). The low error rate might be related to the fairly simple two-alternative choice (instead of four responses in the regular Stroop task), and the processing of superimposed gender labels might not be as \u201cautomatic\u201d as color-word reading in the regular Stroop task. Having said this, integrating the behavioral data into a diffusion decision model, e.g. see  , could be useful to better characterize the neural and cognitive processes of decision making in the face-word Stroop task (and in comparison to the color-word Stroop task), but this is beyond the scope of the current study. Here, we focused on how memory processes were modulated by previous conflict processing. The precise mechanisms underlying the Stroop effect in different paradigms may be addressed in future studies. Moreover, RT and accuracy assess partly different aspects of conflict processing and the data do not suggest that participants have traded speed for accuracy. \n\nFurthermore, none of the conflict-related activation clusters we found in the whole-brain analysis in healthy controls turned out to be predictive of healthy subjects\u2019 memory performance, neither over both task conditions, nor specifically for faces of incongruent trials. This might be explained by an insufficient study power. Moreover, it might be related to the generally increased retrieval rates in healthy subjects in the present study compared to the previous one ( ). To account for memory deficits in MTLE patients, we extended the learning phase (familiarization), assuming that this may reduce memory encoding demands during the actual Stroop task. Furthermore, the absence of neutral trials (compared to the paradigm in our previous study) possibly reduced the saliency of the conflict condition. Thus, we suspect that changes in the paradigm that were necessary for investigating MTLE patients reduced the effects of congruency on memory and the corresponding BOLD contrasts of healthy subjects. Related to this, the behavioral congruency effect was particularly evident for the true remembered vs. forgotten comparison. However, which type of memory (i.e. hippocampus-dependent episodic details or hippocampus-independent schematic information) is particularly modulated by conflict, cannot be answered by the current study. This might be an interesting step towards a better understanding of conflict-modulation of memory processes. Furthermore, in contrast to the behavioral contrast, the fMRI recollection contrast (high confident vs. not high confident recollection) revealed more reliable effects due to balanced item numbers. Thus, the relation between behavioral and fMRI results is limited. \n\nAnother limitation is that patients with unilateral left and right MTLE as well as bilateral MTLE were involved in the study, so that we cannot infer whether the fMRI results are modulated by epilepsy lateralization. We did not further analyze fMRI results of subgroups due to their small sample sizes. The delay between learning and retrieval task was not identical between subjects but was between 30 and 45\u00a0min. However, the delay randomly varied in all participants and it is unlikely that a systematic error affected group differences. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur study provides first evidence that the memory benefit of conflicting information is absent in MTLE patients and thus seems to critically rely on the integrity of the hippocampus. In healthy participants, the two functions of memory formation and response conflict resolution competed for resources in the hippocampus. In addition, posterior midline areas such as precuneus and PCC supported conflict resolution. In MTLE patients, these posterior midline areas showed reduced conflict-related activation but were recruited for memory formation instead. These results would be in line with a large-scale reorganization of memory networks in epilepsy patients. These alterations may be related to memory impairments and/or deficits in the employment of memories for cognitive control functions. However, further studies in hippocampus-lesioned patients are needed to test the association between episodic memory networks and cognitive control mechanisms. \n\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement \n  \n Markus Ramm:   Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review & editing.

The purpose of this study was to explore the alterations of the cortical-striatal network in HFS using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). \n\n Methods:   The fMRI data of 30 adult patients with primary unilateral HFS (15 left-side and 15 right-side) and 30 healthy controls were collected. Six subregions of the striatum in each hemisphere were selected for functional connectivity (FC) analysis. One-sample   t-  test was used to analyze the intragroup FC of the HFS group and the control group. Two-sample   t  -test was used to compare the difference of FC between the two groups. The correlation between the abnormal FC and severity of HFS was evaluated by using the Spearman correlation analysis. \n\n Results:   Compared with the controls, the striatal subregions had altered FC with motor and orbitofrontal cortex in patients with HFS. The altered FC between striatal subregions and motor cortex was correlated with the spasm severity in patients with HFS. \n\n Conclusion:   The FC of the cortical-striatal network was altered in primary HFS, and these alterations were correlated with the severity of HFS. This study indicated that the cortical-striatal network may play different roles in the underlying pathological mechanism of HFS. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nHemifacial spasm (HFS) is a syndrome of involuntary contraction of facial muscles innervated by ipsilateral facial nerves ( ), which can gradually affect facial expressive muscles and platysma muscles ( ). Primary HFS is believed to be caused by vascular compression of the facial nerve at its root exit zone ( ), but the central mechanism is still not clear. Studies have found that depression and anxiety are more common in patients with HFS ( ;  ). Striatum plays a prominent role in modulating motor activity and higher cognitive function ( ). However, the exact neural mechanism of the striatum in the regulation of motor in patients with HFS still remains unexplored. Early identification of functional changes in the cortical-striatal loop of patients with HFS can help to understand disease pathogenesis and achieve early diagnosis as well as effective treatments. This study was aimed to investigate the altered cortical-striatal network in patients with primary HFS, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). \n\nAs part of the extrapyramidal system, the striatum is integral to the motor, cognitive, and emotion regulation functions ( ). The subregions of the striatum, such as putamen, caudate, and ventral striatum, also are associated with different brain functions. Previous anatomical and neuroimaging studies of the striatum have shown that the putamen mainly receives projections from the sensorimotor cortex, and the caudate receives projections from the associated cortex, while the ventral striatum receives projections from the medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and limbic system ( ;  ;  ). \n\nBased on these facts, striatum would be able to exhibit profound influences in motor disorders. For example, as one part of the striatum, putamen can regulate the amplitude and velocity of muscle contraction   via   the cortical-striatal loop and the dopamine system, and therefore plays a significant role in some motor disorders, including Parkinson\u2019s disease and Huntington\u2019s disease ( ;  ). The abnormal functional connectivity (FC) between the striatum and the motor cortex was also found in patients with motor disorders ( ;  ;  ). In Parkinson\u2019s disease, after the substantia nigra degeneration, the content of dopamine in the striatum is also decreased ( ), and in addition to the abnormal striatum-substantia nigra loop, the cortex-striatum loop may also be abnormal ( ). These results further highlight the significance of the striatum in the development of motor disorders. Besides, the researchers have used FC analysis to study the function of striatal subregions in healthy people ( ), patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease ( ;  ), depression ( ;  ), autism ( ), and obsessive-compulsive disorder ( ), and the mechanisms of central alterations in different subregions of the striatum have been revealed. \n\nCurrent resting-state fMRI studies of HFS are limited, and the results are diverse. The regional homogeneity (ReHo) index has been used in most previous studies to indicate time-domain coherence between neighboring voxels in the brain. Researchers have found ReHo abnormalities in the motor cortex, frontal lobes, and cerebellum in patients with HFS ( ;  ;  ), and no ReHo alterations in the striatum, probably due to the small sample size and the different meanings between the analysis indexes, i.e., ReHo and FC. However, one study reported that patients after infarction of the caudate, one of the subregions of the striatum, presented with HFS, suggesting that the striatum may play an important role in the development of HFS ( ). In addition, another study on facial nerve palsy found altered FC between the striatum and motor cortex after facial muscle paralysis, further affirming the relationship between the striatum and facial muscle movement ( ). To the best of our knowledge, there are few earlier studies on HFS using the FC analysis method. One study showed abnormalities in FC between the thalamus and parietal cortex in patients with HFS ( ), but it did not explore the central changes of the striatum in this dyskinesia. HFS is a kind of facial movement disorder, it is not clear that how the striatum regulates the motor function of patients with HFS before and after the onset of its symptoms, and in this study, we focused on striatal function in patients with HFS. \n\nIn this study, we performed FC analysis of 12 striatal subregions in patients with HFS. We hypothesized that in patients with chronic primary HFS, the FC between the striatum and motor cortex and FC between striatal subregions will be changed. Since long-term HFS may result in psychological problems, such as depression and anxiety ( ), we also hypothesized that the FC between the striatum subregions and the emotion-related cortex will be altered in patients with HFS. Furthermore, we explored the relationship between altered FC and clinical characteristics in patients with HFS. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nA total of 60 subjects were selected from a total of 64 participants, and 4 subjects (3 patients with HFS and 1 healthy control) were excluded from the analysis due to excessive head motion (translational movement > 2 mm or rotation > 2\u00b0). Then, 30 patients with HFS (15 left-side HFS, 15 right-side HFS, 12 men, 18 women, age 48.87 \u00b1 10.61 years) were enrolled from 2017 to 2019 in the Department of Neurosurgery, China-Japan Friendship Hospital. HFS was diagnosed by two experienced neurologists based on clinical symptoms and history. The severity of HFS was assessed using the Cohen spasm scale (0\u20134 scores, with higher scores indicating more severe spasm) ( ). The inclusion criteria for patients were as follows: (1) adult patients with primary unilateral HFS, (2) without craniocerebral lesions and mental disorders, no use of psychotropic drugs, and (3) being right-handed. The exclusion criteria for patients were as follows: (1) with bilateral HFS, (2) having contraindications to MRI examination, and (3) with excessive head motion. Notably, 30 age-, sex-, education-matched healthy controls (12 men, 18 women, age 47.63 \u00b1 13.29 years) were recruited from the society. The inclusion criteria for healthy controls are as follows: (1) aged 18 years old or above, (2) absence of neurological and mental disorders, and (3) being right-handed. The demographic and clinical characteristics of participants are shown in  . This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our hospital, and all subjects have given informed consent before the experiment. \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of participants. \n    \n\n### Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Acquisition \n  \nThe experiment was carried out on the 3.0 T MRI scanner (GE, Discovery MR750, Milwaukee, United States) with an 8-channel phased-array head coil. The resting-state fMRI with a single-shot gradient recalled echo-planar imaging sequence was performed with the following recipe. The repetition time (TR) was 2,000 ms, while the echo time (TE) was set to 30 ms. The slice thickness was chosen to be 3.5 mm with a spacing of 0.7 mm. The matrix of the image was 64 \u00d7 64, while the field of view (FOV) was 224 mm \u00d7 224 mm. The flip angle was 90\u00b0, and the number of excitations (NEX) was set to 1. A total of 8 min were consumed for each data with 34 slices and 240 time points. T2WI scan was used to exclude the cerebral organic lesions. 3D T1WI anatomic images were reconstructed using three-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo sequences (3D FSPGR), and the TR of which was 6.7 ms, while the TE was set to minimum full. The matrix was changed to 256 \u00d7 256 with a FOV of 256 mm \u00d7 256 mm. Furthermore, the slice thickness was chosen as 1.0 mm, while the NEX remained to be 1. \n\n\n### Data Preprocessing \n  \nTo unify the affected side of the patients, the T1WI and fMRI data with left HFS (15 cases) and matched controls (15 cases) were flipped from left to right before preprocessing ( ). In this study, \u201cright\u201d was defined as the ipsilateral side, and \u201cleft\u201d was defined as the contralateral side for the flipped data. The preprocessing was conducted using the software of Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) ( ) in the following steps. First, the DICOM data were converted to NIFTI format and the first 10 time points for each file were removed. Second, the timing correction and realignment were carried out, the T1WI to the mean functional image was co-registered, and the DARTEL tool to compute transformations from individual native space to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space was used ( ). The subjects with head motion exceeding 2 mm or 2\u00b0 were excluded. Then, the spatial smoothing using a 4-mm Gaussian kernel was performed and the low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise using band-pass filtering (0.01\u20130.1 Hz) were removed. Finally, the Friston 24-parameter model was used to regress out head motion effects. In this step, the white matter signal, cerebrospinal fluid signal, and global signal were regressed as covariates. \n\n\n### Definition of the Region of Interest \n  \nThe regions of interest (ROIs) were determined by the \u201cDefine ROI\u201d module using DPARSF software, based on the radius and MNI spatial coordinates. According to the previous study, six striatal subregions of each hemisphere were selected as ROIs, and the radius of each ROI was set to 3 mm. The MNI coordinates of the ROIs were as follows: dorsal caudal putamen (DCP, \u00b1 28, 1, 3), dorsal rostral putamen (DRP, \u00b1 25, 8, 6), ventral rostral putamen (VRP, \u00b1 20, 12, \u2212 3), dorsal caudate (DC, \u00b1 13, 15, 9), inferior ventral striatum (VSi, \u00b1 9, 9, \u22128), and superior ventral striatum (VSs, \u00b1 10, 15, 0) ( ). The diagram of ROIs is shown in  . \n  \nThe ROI schematic diagrams of striatal subregions. ROI, region of interest; I, ipsilateral; C, contralateral; DCP, dorsal caudal putamen; DRP, dorsal rostral putamen; VRP, ventral rostral putamen; DC, dorsal caudate; VSi, inferior ventral striatum; VSs, superior ventral striatum. \n  \n\n### Analysis of Functional Connectivity Based on Voxel-Wise \n  \nFirst, the time course of the average BOLD signal was extracted from each ROI. Then, the Pearson\u2019s correlation between the time course of each ROI and the time course of all other voxels in the brain was calculated. Fisher   z   transformation was performed to improve the normal distribution of the data. Then, the correlation map, that is, the FC map of the whole brain was generated for further statistical analysis. \n\n#### Intragroup Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nTo explore the intragroup FC patterns of the cortical-striatal network, one-sample   t-  tests (default mask) were performed in the HFS group and the HC group. The statistical threshold was set at   z   > 3.6594 and cluster size of >6 mm , which corresponded to a corrected   P   < 0.001. This correction threshold was determined using Monte Carlo simulations with the program AlphaSim in AFNI ( ). \n\n\n#### Between-Group Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nTo determine the FC differences of the cortical-striatal network between the two groups, two-sample   t  -tests were performed at each FC map of 12 ROIs (default mask). The Gaussian random field (GRF) method was used for multiple comparison corrections, and the statistical threshold was set at voxel-level   P   < 0.005 and cluster-level   P   < 0.05. The DPABI software was used to perform the statistical analysis of FC. \n\n\n#### Correlation Analysis \n  \nThe   z   value of brain regions with significant changes in the HFS group was extracted to explore the relationship between the severity of HFS and altered connectivity. Then, the Spearman correlation analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software to evaluate the correlation between abnormal FC and spasm severity in patients with HFS. The age, sex, education, and duration were regressed as covariates. We also explored the relationship between duration and spasm severity through Spearman correlation analysis, and the age, sex, and education level were regressed as covariates as well. A total of 14 correlations were performed, with 13 abnormal FCs correlating with spasm severity, and, finally, 1 correlation was performed between spasm severity and disease duration. The false discovery rate (FDR) method was used to correct the results of the correlation analysis for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n\n### Analysis of Functional Connectivity Based on Regions of Interest-Wise \n  \nThe FC between the striatal ROIs was also calculated. After Fisher   z   transformation, a 12 \u00d7 12 FC matrix was generated for every subject. A total of 66   z   values were constructed, and each   z   value stands for the FC between two brain regions. Two-sample   t  -tests were performed using SPSS 20.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, United States) to compare the difference of FC between the HFS group and the HC group. Age, gender, and education were regressed as covariates. FDR correction was used to control false positives for multiple comparisons, and the statistical threshold was set at   P   < 0.05. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Clinical Results \n  \nThere were no significant differences in sex, age, and education level between the HFS group and the HC group (  P   > 0.05) ( ). \n\n\n### Intragroup Functional Connectivity in the Cortical-Striatal Network \n  \nThe intragroup FC maps of the cortical-striatal network were similar in the HC and HFS groups, which is consistent with previous studies ( ;  ;  ).

Compared with the controls, the striatal subregions had altered FC with motor and OFC in patients with HFS. Furthermore, the FC between the ventral striatum and motor cortex was positively associated with the severity of HFS. Finally, our results suggest that the cortical-striatal network may play differential roles in the underlying pathological mechanism of HFS. \n\n### Increased Functional Connectivity of the Cortical-Striatal Network in Patients With Hemifacial Spasm \n  \nAs we know, this is the first resting-state fMRI study to examine intrinsic cortical-striatal connectivity in HFS. The emotion-related cortex showed significantly increased FC with the ventral striatum and putamen, in patients with HFS compared with the controls. The orbitofrontal lobe and the VSi are involved in emotional activities ( ;  ). The structural and functional abnormalities of those regions were found to be widespread in patients with depression ( ;  ;  ;  ). Long-term HFS may lead to anxiety and depression ( ). The increased connectivity between the VSi and orbitofrontal lobe may be associated with the poor mental status of patients with HFS. The SOG was located in the visual network, and studies have found that this area was involved in facial expression and emotion processing ( ). We speculated that the increased functional activity of these regions in patients with HFS may be related to abnormal facial expressions. In addition, the putamen had increased FC with MFG and SFG, which may be associated with the depression and other adverse emotions of the patients with HFS, and it is consistent with previous studies in patients with depression ( ). In summary, the ventral striatum was mainly involved in emotional activities, while the putamen may also involve in emotional activities in addition to motor function. \n\n\n### Decreased Functional Connectivity of the Cortical-Striatal Network in Patients With Hemifacial Spasm \n  \nWe also found that the FC between the putamen and the ipsilateral motor cortex was decreased in the HFS group, and so does the FC between the caudate and the cerebellum. It was known that the precentral gyrus was the first somatic motor area, and the SFG was the premotor area. One side of the cerebral motor area dominates the contralateral body movement, but the muscles involved in associated movement are dominated by bilateral motor areas, such as extraocular muscles and masticatory muscles ( ). The decrease of FC between the putamen and ipsilateral motor area may be a compensatory mechanism to inhibit facial muscle spasms. In addition, the cerebellum is an important motor regulation center. The cerebellum may be involved in the processing of movement, cognition, and emotion by forming loops with the brain, and structural or functional abnormalities in these loops may contribute to the development of motor disorders (e.g., ataxia) ( ). Abnormalities in the connectivity between brain regions within the loops can lead to disorders that are associated with loop dysfunction. The cerebellum may form a loop with the cortical-caudate, which is involved in the motor regulation of HFS, and the diminished connectivity may be a consequence of the dysfunction of the caudate-cerebellar loop. To sum up, in addition to the putamen, other parts of the striatum, such as the caudate, may be involved in the pathological process of HFS. Different cortical-striatal loops may be involved in motion monitoring, error detection, and correction ( ). \n\n\n### Increased Functional Connectivity Within the Striatal Network in Patients With Hemifacial Spasm (Uncorrected,   P   < 0.05) \n  \nIn this study, we found no significant differences in FC within the striatal network between the two groups (FDR correction, threshold   P   < 0.05). However, using a less conservative threshold (  P   < 0.05), we found that the FC between the putamen ROIs was increased in patients with HFS compared with the controls. Interestingly, a study of the striatal network in facial palsy found the decreased FC between the putamen and the ventral striatum (uncorrected) ( ), which is the opposite of our results. We know that facial palsy and facial spasm are two motor disorders with opposite manifestations, the former shows reduced or no movement of the affected facial muscles and the latter shows excessive movement. In addition, the connectivity within the striatal network is also consistent with clinical manifestations, i.e., being diminished in facial palsy and increased in facial spasm. Therefore, we speculated that the putamen plays an important role in the motor function of facial muscles, and the increased or decreased FC between the putamen and other seeds within the striatum may respond to the increased or decreased motor signals in this neural circuit, thus resulting in different motor states of the facial muscles. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThere were several limitations in this study. First, the sample size of this study was small, including patients with left HFS and right HFS. To control the problem on the different sides of the lesion, we flipped the left HFS group from left to right. In the future, the changes of brain functional networks in patients with left and right HFS can be studied separately on the basis of expanding the sample size. Second, this study used a cross-sectional study design to explore the changes of the cortical-striatal network in patients with HFS. Longitudinal studies can be conducted in the future to explore the mechanism of brain network changes in different stages of HFS. Finally, previous studies and our study have all found functional abnormalities in the emotion-related cortex in patients with HFS. Therefore, increasing the evaluation of the psychological status of patients may make the results more reliable, which can be added in further studies. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nPrimary unilateral HFS induces several FC alterations in the cortical-striatal network, specifically, the striatal subregions have altered connectivity with motor and OFC in patients with HFS, respectively. The severity of HFS is associated with these functional alterations. This study provides significant evidence that the altered cortical-striatal connectivity is involved in differential neural mechanisms of motor and emotional dysfunction in patients with HFS. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of China-Japan Friendship Hospital.

The degree to which brain networks supporting spoken word recognition are affected by adult aging remains poorly understood. In the current study we used fMRI to measure the brain responses to spoken words in two conditions: an attentive listening condition, in which no response was required, and a repetition task. Listeners were 29 young adults (aged 19\u201330 years) and 32 older adults (aged 65\u201381 years) without self-reported hearing difficulty. We found largely similar patterns of activity during word perception for both young and older adults, centered on the bilateral superior temporal gyrus. As expected, the repetition condition resulted in significantly more activity in areas related to motor planning and execution (including the premotor cortex and supplemental motor area) compared to the attentive listening condition. Importantly, however, older adults showed significantly less activity in probabilistically defined auditory cortex than young adults when listening to individual words in both the attentive listening and repetition tasks. Age differences in auditory cortex activity were seen selectively for words (no age differences were present for 1-channel vocoded speech, used as a control condition), and could not be easily explained by accuracy on the task, movement in the scanner, or hearing sensitivity (available on a subset of participants). These findings indicate largely similar patterns of brain activity for young and older adults when listening to words in quiet, but suggest less recruitment of auditory cortex by the older adults. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nUnderstanding spoken words requires mapping complex acoustic signals to a listener\u2019s stored lexical representations. Evidence from neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience provides increasingly converging evidence about the roles of the bilateral temporal cortex (particularly the superior temporal gyrus and the middle temporal gyrus) in processing speech acoustics and recognizing single words ( ;  ;  ). However, the degree to which the networks supporting spoken word recognition change over our lifetime remains unclear. The goals of the current study were to test whether young and older adults relied on different brain networks during successful spoken word recognition, and whether any age differences were related to the specific task. \n\nImportant themes when considering older adults\u2019 language processing include the degree to which linguistic processing is preserved, and whether older adults may adopt different strategies when understanding language compared to young adults ( ;  ). Particularly important for spoken word recognition is that adult aging frequently brings changes to both hearing sensitivity ( ) and cognitive ability ( ). Thus, it is not surprising that older adults\u2019 spoken word perception differs from that of young adults, particularly in the presence of background noise ( ). Older adults tend to take longer to recognize words ( ;  ), make more recognition errors than young adults, and show increased sensitivity to factors such as the number of phonological neighbors (competitors) associated with a given target word ( ). An open question centers on the brain networks on which older adults rely during spoken word recognition. Of particular interest is whether additional regions may be recruited to support successful recognition, compared to those engaged by young adults. \n\nA number of studies have investigated neural activity during older adults\u2019 speech processing in noise or other acoustic degradation, using an assortment of tasks and testing participants with different levels of hearing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ).  , for example, examined spoken word recognition in young and older adults. They varied the intelligibility of the target items using low-pass filtering of the acoustic signal. During scanning, participants were asked to repeat back the word they heard. The authors found increased activity in regions associated with word processing, including the auditory cortex and the premotor cortex, when words were more intelligible; these intelligibility-related changes did not statistically differ between young and older adults. Older adults did show more activation in the anterior cingulate cortex and the supplemental motor area than the young adults did, suggesting a possible increase in top-down executive control. \n\nAge differences in speech understanding have also been studied in the context of sentence comprehension. One common finding is that during successful sentence processing, older adults show additional activity compared to young adults (e.g., in contralateral homologs to regions seen in young adults, or in regions beyond the network activated by young adults;  ;  ). These findings have been interpreted in a compensation framework in which older adults are less efficient using a core speech network and need to recruit additional regions to support successful comprehension ( ). However, at least some of this additional activity has been shown to be related to the tasks performed by participants in the scanner, which frequently contain metalinguistic decisions not required during everyday conversation ( ). Thus, it may be that core language computations are well-preserved in aging ( ;  ). \n\nThe role of executive attention in older adults\u2019 spoken word recognition has also been of significant interest. Listening to speech that is acoustically degraded can result in perception errors, after which listeners must re-engage attention systems to support successful listening. The cingulo-opercular network, an executive attention network ( ;  ), shows increased activity following perception errors (similar to error-related activity in other domains). Crucially, when listening to spoken words in background noise, increased cingulo-opercular activity following one trial is associated with recognition success on the following trial ( ;  ), consistent with a role in maintaining task-related attention ( ). \n\nAn important challenge when considering the performance of listeners with hearing loss is that words may not be equally intelligible to all listeners. A common measure of accuracy in spoken word recognition is to ask listeners to repeat each word after hearing it; however, this type of task requires motor responses, which may obscure activations related to speech perception and increase participant motion in the scanner ( ). In addition, differences in the brain regions coordinating speech   production   in older adults ( ;  ) may interfere with clear measurements of activity during perception and recognition. The degree to which motor effects resulting from word repetition may obscure activity related to speech perception is unclear. In sentence processing tasks, task effects can be significant ( ), and if not accounted for may obscure what are actually consistent patterns of language-related activity across the lifespan ( ). \n\nIn the current study we investigated spoken word processing in young and older adult listeners in the absence of background noise. We compared paradigms requiring words to be repeated with \u201cattentive listening\u201d (no motor response required). Our interest is, first, whether age differences exist in the brain networks supporting spoken word recognition, and second, whether these differences are affected by the choice of task. Thus, our primary analyses will focus on activity seen for words (greater than noise) in the experimental conditions. \n\nThe influence of psycholinguistic factors on spoken word recognition has long been appreciated. In a secondary set of analyses, we will investigate whether word frequency or phonological neighborhood density modulate activity during spoken word recognition. Although behavioral and electrophysiological studies suggest that high frequency words are processed more quickly than low frequency words, the degree to which this might be captured in fMRI is unclear. Similarly, although neighborhood density effects are widely reported in behavioral studies (with words from dense neighborhoods typically being more difficult to process), the degree to which lexical competition effects may differ with age is unclear. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \nStimuli, data, and analysis scripts are available from  . \n\n### Participants \n  \nWe recruited two groups of participants (young and older adults) for this study. The young adults were 29 self-reported healthy, right-handed adults, aged 19\u201330 years (  M   = 23.8,   SD   = 2.9, 19 female), and were recruited via the Washington University in St. Louis Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences Subject Pool. Older adult participants were 32 self-reported healthy, right-handed adults, aged 65\u201381 years (  M   = 71.0,   SD   = 5.0, 17 female). All participants self-reported themselves to be native speakers of American English with no history of neurological difficulty, and with normal hearing (and no history of a diagnosed hearing problem). Participants were compensated for their participation, and all provided informed consent commensurate with practices approved by the Washington University in St. Louis Institutional Review Board. \n\nAudiograms were collected on a subset of eight young and nine older participants using pure-tone audiometry ( ). We summarized hearing ability using a better-ear pure tone average (PTA) at 1, 2, and 4 kHz. PTAs in participants\u2019 better hearing ears ranged from \u22123.33 to 8.33 dB HL in young adults (  M   = 2.92,   SD   = 4.15), and 8.33 to 23.3 dB HL in older adults (  M   = 23.3,   SD   = 9.17). \n  \nExperiment overview. (a) Audiograms for the subset of participants on whom hearing was available for left and right ears. Individual participants are shown in thin lines, group means in thick lines. (b) Frequency of occurrence and phonological neighborhood density for the 240 experimental items. (c) Task design for attentive listening and word repetition tasks. (d) Behavioral accuracy for the repetition condition for young and older adults. HAL = Hyperspace Analogue to Language, EPI = echo planar imaging. \n  \n\n### Materials \n  \nStimuli for this study were 375 monosyllabic consonant-vowel-consonant words. The auditory stimuli were recorded at 48 kHz using a 16-bit digital-to-analog converter with an Audio Technica 2035 microphone in a quiet room. Words were spoken by a female speaker with a standard American dialect. Root-mean-square amplitude of the stimuli was equated. \n\nOut of the full set of words, 75 words were vocoded using a single channel with white noise as a carrier signal ( ) using   jp_vocode.m   from  . These stimuli were used for an unintelligible baseline \u201cnoise\u201d condition. The remaining 300 words were divided into five lists of 60 words, using MATCH software ( ), and were balanced for word frequency (as measured by the log of the Hyperspace Analogue to Language dataset), orthographic length, concreteness ( ), and familiarity ( ). The distribution of word frequency and phonological neighborhood density are shown in  . \n\nOne of these lists was combined with 15 of the noise vocoded words and used for word repetition task practice outside of the scanner. The remaining four lists of 60 words served as the critical items inside the scanner, with half of the lists used for attentive listening (120 total words) and the other half for word repetition (120 total words). Word lists were counterbalanced such that each word was presented in both \u201clisten\u201d and \u201crepeat\u201d conditions across participants. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nPrior to scanning, participants were taken to a quiet room. (The room was not sound isolated and low frequency noise from the building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system was typically present.) During that time participants provided informed consent, completed demographic questionnaires, and a subset had their hearing tested using a calibrated Maico MA40 portable audiometer (Maico Diagnostics, Inc., Eden Prairie MN) by an audiologist-trained researcher. \n\nParticipants were then instructed for the two tasks they would perform in the scanner: attentive listening and word repetition. During attentive listening, participants were asked to stay alert, still, and keep their eyes focused on a fixation cross while listening to a sequence of auditory sounds, including words, silence, and noise (single-channel noise vocoded words). During word repetition, participants were asked to do the same as in attentive listening, with the addition of repeating the word they just heard aloud. Participants were instructed to repeat the words following the volume acquisition after each word ( ). Participants were told to give their best guess if they could not understand a word. Participants practiced a simulation of the word repetition task until the experimenter was confident that the participant understood the pacing and the nature of the task. Sound levels were adjusted to achieve audible presentations at the beginning of the study and thereafter not adjusted. \n\nFunctional MRI scanning took place over the course of four scanning blocks, where participants alternated between blocks of attentive listening and word repetition ( ). The order of blocks was counterbalanced such that participants were equally likely to begin with a word repetition or an attentive listening block. During word repetition, participants\u2019 spoken responses were recorded using an in-bore Fibersound optical microphone. These responses were scored for accuracy offline by a research assistant ( ). \n\n\n### MRI Data Acquisition and Processing \n  \nThe MRI data collected in this study are available from   ( ). MRI data were acquired using a Siemens Prisma scanner (Siemens Medical Systems) at 3 T equipped with a 32-channel head coil. Scan sequences began with a T1-weighted structural volume using an MPRAGE sequence (repetition time [TR] = 2.4 s, echo time [TE] = 2.2 ms, flip angle = 8\u00b0, 300 \u00d7 320 matrix, voxel size = 0.8 mm isotropic). Blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI images were acquired using a multiband echo planar imaging sequence ( ; TR = 3.07 s, TA = 0.770 s, TE = 37 ms, flip angle = 37\u00b0, voxel size = 2 mm isotropic, multiband factor = 8). (The flip angle was suboptimal due to an error setting up the sequences; although discovered partway through the study, we left it unchanged to maintain consistent data quality. With a TR of ~3 s we would expect a better signal-to-noise ratio with a flip angle of 90\u00b0.) We used a sparse imaging design in which there was a 2.3 s delay between scanning acquisitions and the TR was longer than the acquisition time to allow for minimal scanning noise during stimulus presentation and audio recording of participant responses ( ;  ). \n\nAnalysis of the MRI data was performed using Automatic Analysis version 5.4.0 ( ; RRID:SCR_003560), which scripted a combination of SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging) version 7487 (RRID:SCR_007037) and FMRIB Software Library (FSL; FMRIB Analysis Group;  ) version 6.0.1 (RRID:SCR_002823). \n\nData were realigned using rigid-body image registration, and functional data were coregistered with the bias-corrected T1-weighted structural image. Spatial and functional images were normalized to MNI space using a unified segmentation approach ( ), and resampled to 2 mm. Finally, the functional data were smoothed using an 8 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. \n\nFor the attentive listening condition, we did not have measures of accuracy, so we analyzed all trials. For the repetition condition, we analyzed only trials associated with correct responses. For both tasks, we modeled the noise condition in addition to words. Finally, we included three parametric modulators for word events: word frequency, phonological neighborhood density, and their interaction. To avoid order effects ( ), these were not orthogonalized. \n\nMotion effects were of particular importance given that participants were speaking during the repetition condition. To mitigate the effects of motion, we used a thresholding approach in which high motion frames were individually modeled for each subject using a delta function in the general linear model (see, e.g.,  ). Motion was quantified using framewise displacement (FD), calculated from the six motion parameters estimated during realignment, assuming the head is a sphere having a radius of 50 mm ( ). We then chose an FD threshold (0.561) that we used for all participants. Our rationale was that some participants move more, and thus produce worse data; we therefore wanted to use a single threshold for all participants, resulting in more data exclusion from high-motion participants. This threshold resulted in 2.2\u201319.4% (  M   = 6.21,   SD   = 4.45) data exclusion for the young adults and 2.8\u201358.4% (  M   = 22.6,   SD   = 15.3) data exclusion for the older adults. For each frame exceeding this threshold, we added a column to that participant\u2019s design matrix consisting of a delta function at the time point in question, which effectively excludes the variance of that frame from the model. \n\nContrast images from single subject analyses were analyzed at the second level using permutation testing (FSL   randomise  ; 5,000 permutations;  ), with a cluster-forming threshold of   p   < 0.001 (uncorrected) and results corrected for multiple comparisons based on cluster extent (  p   < 0.05). Images (contrast images and unthresholded   t   maps) are available from   ( ). Anatomical localization was performed using converging evidence from author experience ( ) viewing statistical maps overlaid in MRIcroGL ( ), supplemented by atlas labels ( ). \n\nFor region of interest (ROI) analysis of primary auditory cortex, we used probabilistic maps based on postmortem human histological staining ( ), available in the SPM Anatomy toolbox ( ; RRID:SCR_013273). We created a binary mask for regions Te1.0 and Te1.1 and then extracted parameter estimates for noise and word contrasts for the attentive listening and repetition conditions from each participant\u2019s first-level analyses by averaging over all voxels in each ROI (left auditory, right auditory). \n\nOutputs from analysis stages used for quality control are available from   in the aa_report folder. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Behavioral Data \n  \nWe analyzed the accuracy data using a linear mixed effects analysis, implemented using the   lme4   and   lmerTest   packages in R version 3.6.2 ( ;  ; RRID:SCR_001905). Because trial-level accuracy data was binary, we used logistic regression. We first tested for age differences using a model that included age group as a fixed factor and subject as a random factor:  \nm0 <- glmer(accuracy ~ age_group + (1 | subject), \n\n\u2003\u2003\u2003data = df, family = \"binomial\") \n \n\nThe estimate of age_group was \u22121.4929 (  SE   = 0.1902),   p   = 4.24e\u221215, consistent with a main effect of age (older adults performing more poorly). Because of the ceiling effects and the lack of variability in the young adult data, we ran an additional analysis only in the older adults, using a model that included neighborhood density and word frequency as fixed factors, and item and subject as random factors:  \nm1 <- glmer(accuracy ~ neighborhood_density * log_freq + \n\n\u2003\u2003\u2003(1 | word) + (1 | subject), \n\n\u2003\u2003\u2003data = df, family = \"binomial\") \n \n\nThe model failed to converge when including a more complex random effect structure. The results of this model are shown in  . There were no significant effects of neighborhood density or word frequency in the accuracy data. \n  \nFixed effects results for accuracy data model \n    \nThere are many reasons a participant might make an incorrect response, and our primary interest is in the processes supporting successful comprehension. Thus, for the fMRI analyses, we restricted our analyses to correct trials only. \n\n\n### Imaging Data \n  \nWe began by looking at activity in the auditory cortex, followed by whole-brain analyses. Activity in left and right auditory cortex for noise and word conditions for young and older adults is shown in  . We analyzed these data using a linear mixed effects analysis, implemented using the   lme4   and   lmerTest   packages in R version 3.6.2 (RRID:SCR_001905). The full model included task (listen, repeat), stimulus (word, noise), hemisphere (left, right), age group (young, older), and accuracy on the repetition task as fixed factors, with subject, stimulus type, and task as random factors:  \nm1 <- lmer(activity ~ task * stimulus * hemisphere * agegroup + accuracy + \n\n\u2003\u2003\u2003(1 + stimulus * task | subject), \n\n\u2003\u2003\u2003data = dfleftright) \n When including hemisphere as an additional random factor, the model failed to converge, and as our main interests lay elsewhere we settled on the above model. \n  \nActivity in auditory cortex regions of interest. (a) Activity (parameter estimates, arbitrary units) for left and right auditory cortex as a function of age group and task. Participants are indicated by individual dots; mean \u00b1 standard error indicated by error bars. (b) Activity for left and right auditory cortex during the word repetition task in older adults as a function of accuracy and hearing (hearing only available in a subset of participants). \n  \nFull model results are shown in  . The   p   values were obtained from the   lmerTest   package using the Satterthwaite method for degrees of freedom and   t   statistics. We found significant interactions between task and stimulus, consistent with a greater degree of activation for words relative to noise in the repetition task compared to the attentive listening task. Importantly, there was a significant interaction between stimulus and age group, consistent with greater age differences for words relative to noise. We verified this with follow-up   t   tests, collapsing over hemisphere, which showed a significant difference in activity between young and older adults for words, attentive listening:   t  (57.973) = 3.1428,   p   = 0.002636; repetition:   t  (56.619) = 2.5583,   p   = 0.01322, but not for noise, attentive listening:   t  (58.559) = 0.66361,   p   = 0.5095; repetition:   t  (57.241) = 0.19028,   p   = 0.8498. None of the other main effects or interactions were significant. \n  \nFixed effects results for auditory cortex model \n    \nTo explore the possible contribution of other factors to older adults\u2019 reduced activity in the auditory cortex, we conducted a series of exploratory correlation analyses with accuracy, hearing, and movement parameters from fMRI (median FD). None of these analyses showed significant correlations with auditory cortex activity. Correlations for accuracy and hearing in the word repetition task are shown in  . Overall, we interpret these results as being consistent with less auditory activity for the older adults during spoken word perception (but not during our nonspeech control condition). \n\nTo complement the ROI analyses, we next performed whole-brain analyses for all conditions of interest. Activity for word perception in the attentive listening condition (greater than the noise baseline) is shown in   (with maxima listed in  \u2013 ). As expected, both young and older adults showed significant activity in the bilateral superior temporal cortex. Young adults showed significantly stronger activity in the superior temporal cortex near the auditory cortex. There were no regions in which older adults showed greater activity than young adults. \n  \nWhole-brain activity for the attentive listening condition. Top: Unthresholded parameter estimates. Middle: Unthresholded   t   maps. Bottom: Thresholded   t   maps (  p   < 0.05, cluster corrected). White ovals highlight left and right auditory cortex. \n    \nPeak activations for attentive listening condition greater than noise, young adults \n    \nPeak activations for attentive listening condition greater than noise, older adults \n    \nPeak activations for attentive listening condition greater than noise, young > older adults \n  \nIn addition to the overall pattern associated with word perception, we examined psycholinguistic effects of word frequency and phonological neighborhood density using a parametric modulation analysis. There were no significant effects of either word frequency or neighborhood density in the attentive listening condition. \n\nActivity for word perception in the repetition condition (relative to a noise baseline) is shown in   (with maxima in  \u2013 ). Again, both young and older adults showed significant activity in the bilateral temporal cortex, as well as frontal regions related to articulatory planning, including the premotor cortex and the supplemental motor area. As with the attentive listening condition, young adults showed significantly more activity in superior temporal regions near the auditory cortex. There were no regions where older adults showed more activity than the young adults. \n  \nWhole-brain activity for the repetition condition (correct responses only). Top: Unthresholded parameter estimates. Middle: Unthresholded   t   maps. Bottom: Thresholded   t   maps (  p   < 0.05, cluster corrected). White ovals highlight left and right auditory cortex. \n    \nPeak activations for repetition condition greater than noise, young adults \n    \nPeak activations for repetition condition greater than noise, older adults \n    \nPeak activations for repetition condition greater than noise, young > older adults \n  \nIn addition to the overall pattern associated with word perception, we examined psycholinguistic effects of word frequency and phonological neighborhood density using a parametric modulation analysis.

In both ROI and whole-brain analyses, we found converging evidence for reduced activity in the auditory cortex for the older adults. The age differences in auditory cortex activation were present in both the attentive listening task and the word repetition task: Although the repetition task resulted in more widespread activation overall, patterns of age-related differences in the auditory cortex were comparable. \n\nThere are a number of possible explanations for older adults\u2019 reduced activity during spoken word recognition. One possibility is that age differences in intelligibility might play a role. Intelligible speech is associated with increased activity in a broad network of frontal and temporal regions ( ;  ), and in prior studies of older adults, intelligibility has correlated with auditory cortex activity ( ). We restricted our analyses to correct responses in the repetition condition, and found no statistical support for a relationship between intelligibility and auditory cortex activation (although numerically, participants with better accuracy showed more activity than participants with worse accuracy). \n\nThe fact that young and older adults showed comparable activity in the auditory cortex during noise trials, with age differences emerging for word recognition trials, is significant. Group differences in activation could be driven not only by neural processing, but also by such factors as neurovascular coupling, goodness-of-fit of a canonical hemodynamic response, or movement within the scanner\u2014in other words, artifacts that might differentially impact model parameter estimates in young and older adults but are not of theoretical interest in this context. Although impossible to completely rule out, the selective age differences for speech (but not noise) are consistent with a condition-specific\u2014and thus we argue, neural\u2014interpretation. \n\nRecent evidence suggests age-related changes in temporal sensitivity in auditory regions can be detected with fMRI ( ). Although our current stimuli do not allow us to explore specific acoustic features, one possibility is that the age-related differences in auditory activity we observed reflect well-known changes in auditory cortical processing that occur in normal aging ( ). Given the increased acoustic complexity of the words relative to noise, acoustic processing differences might drive overall response differences. Such changes may also reflect decreased stimulation as a result of hearing loss; we had insufficient data to rule out this possibility. It is important to note that we cannot completely rule out audibility effects. Even though we limited our responses to correct identification trials, specific acoustic features may still have been less audible for the older adults. It remains an open question whether varying the presentation level of the stimuli would change the age effects we observed. \n\nAge differences in auditory processing are not the only explanation for our results. The auditory cortex is positioned in a hierarchy of speech processing regions that include both ascending and descending projections ( ;  ). The auditory cortex not only is sensitive to changes in acoustic information, but also reflects top-down effects of expectation and prediction ( ;  ;  ). Thus, the observed age differences in the auditory cortex may reflect differential top-down modulation of auditory activity in young and older adult listeners. \n\nIndeed, prior to conducting this study, we expected to observe increased activity (e.g., in the prefrontal cortex) for older adults relative to young adults, reflecting top-down compensation for reduced auditory sensitivity. Such activity would be consistent with increased cognitive demand during speech perception in listeners with hearing loss or other acoustic challenges ( ;  ). Although we were somewhat surprised not to see this, in retrospect, perhaps it would be expected. The stimuli in the current study were presented in quiet, and thus may not have challenged perception sufficiently to robustly engage frontal brain networks. We conclude that during perception of acoustically clear words, older adults do not seem to require additional resources from the frontal cortex; whether this changes with increasing speech demands (either acoustic or linguistic) remains an open question. \n\nWe did not observe significant effects of either word frequency or phonological neighborhood density on activity during spoken word recognition. These results stand in contrast to prior studies showing frequency effects in visual word perception in fMRI ( ;  ), and word frequency effects in electrophysiological responses ( ). Prior fMRI studies of lexical competition (including phonological neighborhood density) have been mixed, with some studies finding effects ( ) and others not ( ). It could be that a wider range of frequency or density or a greater number of stimuli would be needed to identify such effects. \n\nFinally, we found largely comparable age differences in the attentive listening and repetition conditions in the auditory cortex. The similarity of the results suggests that using a repetition task may be a reasonable choice in studies of spoken word recognition: Although repetition tasks necessarily engage regions related to articulation and hearing one\u2019s own voice, in our data these were not differentially affected by age. An advantage of using a repetition task, of course, is that trial-by-trial accuracy measures can be obtained, which are frequently useful. It is worth noting that our finding of comparable activity in young and older adults for attentive listening and repetition tasks may not generalize to other stimuli or tasks ( ;  ). \n\nA significant limitation of our current study is that we only collected hearing sensitivity data on a minority of our participants. Thus, although we saw a trend toward poorer hearing being associated with reduced auditory cortex activation, it is challenging to draw any firm conclusions regarding the relationship between hearing sensitivity and brain activity. Prior studies using sentence-level materials have found relationships between hearing sensitivity and brain activity in both young ( ) and older ( ) adults. Future investigations with a larger sample of participants with hearing data will be needed to further explore the effects of hearing in spoken word recognition. \n\nFrom a broader perspective, the link between spoken word recognition and everyday communication is not always straightforward. Much of our everyday communication occurs in the context of semantically meaningful, coherent sentences, frequently with the added availability of visual speech and gesture cues. Given potential age differences in reliance on many of these cues\u2014including older adults\u2019 seemingly greater reliance on semantic context ( ;  ;  )\u2014it seems likely that our findings using isolated spoken words cannot be extrapolated to richer naturalistic settings. \n\nIn summary, we observed largely overlapping brain regions supporting spoken word recognition in young and older adults in the absence of background noise. Older adults showed less activity than young adults in the auditory cortex when listening to words, but not noise. These patterns of age difference were present regardless of the task (attentive listening vs. repetition). \n\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n  \nResearch reported here was funded by grant R01 DC014281 from the US National Institutes of Health.

With age, the sensitivity in action prediction declines. In younger adults, the action observation network (AON), consisting of premotor, parietal and occipitotemporal cortices, has been implicated in transforming executed and observed actions into a common code. Much less is known about age-related changes in the neural representation of observed actions. Using fMRI, the present study measured brain activity in younger and older adults during the prediction of temporarily occluded actions (figure skating elements and simple movement exercises). All participants were highly familiar with the movement exercises whereas only some participants were experienced figure skaters. With respect to the AON, the results confirm that this network was preferentially engaged for the more familiar movement exercises. Compared to younger adults, older adults recruited visual regions to perform the task and, additionally, the hippocampus and caudate when the observed actions were familiar to them. Thus, instead of effectively exploiting the sensorimotor matching properties of the AON, older adults seemed to rely predominantly on the visual dynamics of the observed actions to perform the task. Our data further suggest that the caudate played an important role during the prediction of the less familiar figure skating elements in better-performing groups. Together, these findings show that action prediction engages a distributed network in the brain, which is modulated by the content of the observed actions and the age and experience of the observer. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAs humans, our ability to successfully navigate through our social environment and interact with others is critical for survival. It has been argued that instead of just passively relying on sensory input during the observation of others' actions, we also generate internal predictions on what we see  \u2013 . This enables us to adapt and respond more quickly and efficiently to changes in the environment. The ability to create these action predictions is thought to be based on a shared representation between executed and observed actions  ,  . \n\nSo far, research on the prediction of observed actions focused mainly on younger age groups while neglecting changes in these processes over the lifespan. Evidence suggests that there might be a specific decline in how older adults anticipate observed actions, possibly due to less precise internal action representations (e.g.,  \u2013 ). In a recent behavioral study, we showed that older adults predicted the time course of different action sequences less precisely than younger adults  . Although the timing in prediction was not systematically biased in older compared to younger adults (i.e., generally slower or faster), older adults did not seem to represent the observed actions in sufficient temporal detail in order to predict their exact time-course. This suggests that age-related differences in prediction performance are unlikely to be accounted for by general changes in time perception (cf.,  ). Our results rather imply an age-related decline in how observed actions are internally mapped onto one's own action representations. We further demonstrated that sensorimotor experience with observed actions resulted in a better prediction performance for domain-specific actions in both older and younger experts compared to non-experts. However, how the process of action prediction is implemented in the aging brain depending on the degree of motor familiarity with the observed actions remains an open question. \n\nIn the light of a demographic change visible in many countries with lower fertility rates and rising life expectancies, a better understanding of age-related changes in these vital abilities together with its neural basis is essential in improving skill learning and skill maintenance in older adults (cf.,  ). It is well known that the aging brain is subject to substantial changes at the structural as well as functional level  \u2013 . In addition, older adults exhibit different task-related activation patterns compared to younger adults while performing the same task that could reflect neural dedifferentiation and/or compensation  \u2013 . According to the scaffolding theory of aging and cognition (STAC), aging can be viewed as a (intrinsic) challenge to the human brain just as unfamiliar tasks pose a (extrinsic) challenge to a younger brain  . Both types of challenges result in a functional reorganization (i.e., neural scaffolding) to maintain or improve task performance. Whereas neural recruitment patterns in younger adults become increasingly specialized with training, older adults may recruit additional regions already during the performance of familiar tasks to compensate for noisy and/or inefficient neural processing. However, even in older age groups these neural recruitment patterns are amenable to training  . In sensory as well as motor processing, age-related differences in neural activity together with altered functional connectivity have been demonstrated by a number of studies, possibly reflecting less specific neural representations in action   and   perception with advancing age (e.g.,  \u2013 ). \n\nIn younger adults, neuroimaging studies on action observation identified regions in the premotor and inferior parietal cortex that are similarly activated during action execution  \u2013 . A network comprising these sensorimotor regions as well as occipitotemporal regions implicated in biological motion processing has been referred to as the   action observation network   (AON;  ). By transforming executed and observed actions into a common code, the AON might serve as the neural substrate for the ability to predict the actions of others. According to the predictive coding account, the different regions of the AON are reciprocally connected and an actual representation of the observed action is compared to a predicted representation at each level of the cortical hierarchy  \u2013 . This comparison generates a prediction error, which is back propagated through the cortical hierarchy to update the internal action representation and minimize the prediction error. \n\nConsequently, shared representations between action and perception and their neural basis are assumed to be established through sensorimotor experience that strengthens the connectivity between relevant areas  \u2013 . Studies on skilled motor performance frequently demonstrate superior prediction abilities in experts when they observe actions from their domain of expertise whereas non-experts rather rely on the visual dynamics of the observed actions resulting in a less efficient anticipation performance (e.g.,  \u2013 ). Not surprisingly, AON activity has been shown to be modulated by the sensorimotor experience of the observer. The majority of studies investigating this issue has found increased activity in these regions during the observation of familiar actions as compared to actions that are not in the motor repertoire of the observer (e.g.,  \u2013 ). Observers that are not familiar with the shown actions, in contrast, seem to recruit additional regions beyond the AON, for example, in visual cortices to perform these kinds of tasks (e.g.,  ,  ). In addition, recent evidence indicates that specific task requirements and stimulus characteristics might also result in the activation of regions that are not typically considered to be part of the AON during action observation  \u2013 . For example, Schiffer and Schubotz   showed that prediction errors during action observation in ambiguous contexts are coded within a sub-region of the basal ganglia, the caudate nucleus. They suggested that the caudate might trigger the updating of the respective internal action representation if the sensory input violates the initial prediction. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are only very few studies so far that examined age-related differences in the neural representation of observed actions. By using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), L\u00e9onard and Tremblay   showed that corticomotor facilitation in relevant muscles is less specialized in older compared to younger adults during action observation, imitation, and imagery. In addition, Nedelko et al.   did not report age-related activation differences in the premotor and inferior parietal regions of the AON during observation and imagery of simple goal directed actions. The authors concluded that activity in these regions is age-independent. However, older adults recruited additional regions in the superior parietal and occipital cortices compared to younger adults, which might indicate a different processing of the observed actions (i.e., neural scaffolding). Yet, it remains unclear to what extent the prediction of an observed action is linked to similar changes at the neural level in older adults and whether they are modulated by the degree of motor familiarity in the aging observer. \n\nBy using fMRI, the present study examined the underlying neural activation patterns in younger and older adults during the prediction of action sequences that varied in their degree of motor familiarity (classical figure skating elements and simple movement exercises). All of the participants were highly familiar with the movement exercises, whereas only some of the younger and older adults possessed sensorimotor experience in figure skating. During fMRI scanning, participants were required to judge the temporal coherence of the observed action sequences that were partly occluded at critical time points and whose continuation afterwards was temporarily manipulated. Brain activity was examined as a function of observed action category and continuation after occlusion collapsed across the whole sample as well as a function of age group while controlling for the effects of sensorimotor experience in figure skating. In addition, brain activity between figure skating experts and non-experts was compared to further explore whether neural scaffolding in older adults and inexperienced observers shares a certain degree of similarity (cf.,  ). \n\nSimilar action occlusion paradigms have been used previously to examine action observation and prediction in younger adults (e.g.,  \u2013 ). Graf et al.   and Sparenberg et al.  , for example, provided evidence that a pure visual encoding and extrapolation of occluded actions do not seem to be sufficient in order to accomplish the task effectively. They showed that prediction performance for temporarily occluded actions that are presented upside-down is considerably impaired compared to the observation of the same actions presented in an upright perspective. The paradigm also proved successful in measuring neural activity in the AON during action prediction  ,  . Stadler et al.   compared neural activity during the prediction of occluded actions to different action-related control conditions. The authors found that only the dynamic prediction, but not maintenance, of the actions involved activation in parts of the AON. Similarly, Cross et al.   showed that activity in the AON is greater during the prediction of partly occluded action sequences compared to the observation of un-occluded segments of the same action sequences. \n\nWe hypothesized that the type of observed action sequences modulates activity in the AON. In accordance with previous evidence, we expected to find higher AON activity during the prediction of the movement exercises for which the whole sample was highly experienced with. The less familiar figure skating elements, on the contrary, might be processed in regions beyond the AON due to less precise neural representations in an observer's AON. In addition, we assumed that older adults recruit additional brain regions compared to younger adults, implying less specific internal action representations and/or the reliance on different sources of information in line with the assumptions of STAC  . Thus, older adults just as inexperienced observers might perform the task predominantly based on the visual dynamics of the observed actions, which is accompanied with a greater recruitment of visual cortices, respectively. Age-related differences in neural activation patterns might be further modulated by the degree of motor familiarity, for example, in regions known to be involved in episodic memory. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Ethics statement \n  \nThe study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Leipzig and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants gave written informed consent and received payment for participation. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nA group of 38 participants, comprising younger and older adults, took part in the fMRI experiment. Three participants (one younger adult and two older adults) were excluded from statistical analyses after medical examination of their anatomical scans in which structural abnormalities were diagnosed that might have an influence on their functional images. In addition, one younger adult was excluded due to experience in professional modern dance for six years in adolescence. The final sample consisted of 19 younger (14 women, mean age\u200a=\u200a22.6\u00b12.27 years, range 18\u201327) and 15 older adults (10 women, mean age\u200a=\u200a61.1\u00b15.68 years, range 51\u201371),   t  (32)\u200a=\u200a24.7,   p  <0.001. The majority of the participants already took part in the behavioral action prediction experiment reported in Diersch et al.  . One younger adult and four older adults were additionally recruited from the participant database of the MPI for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig. Before scanning, these participants were invited for a separate testing session in which they completed the relevant questionnaires and performed the behavioral action prediction task to ensure that the whole sample was scanned under the same prerequisites. Time between the two experimental sessions was 5.35 months on average (range 3\u20138 months). Characteristics of the sample divided by age group are shown in  . \n   Characteristics of the sample divided by age group.        \nAll participants were right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory   and reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision. None of the participants reported current evidence of any major physical or neurological disease and/or use of medication that might affect blood flow. In addition, participants completed different psychometric tests to ensure that only healthy older adults would be included in the experiment. This allowed an examination of age-related changes in action prediction that are unlikely to be confounded by the effects of any age-associated pathology. None of the older adults showed indications of cognitive impairment as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE;  ; Maximum score: 30). The groups did not differ with respect to their reported years of education,   t  (32)\u200a=\u200a0.68,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.500. In addition, fluid intelligence (processing speed) was assessed by means of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), a subscale of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III;  ). Older adults obtained lower DSST raw scores than younger adults,   t  (32)\u200a=\u200a5.53,   p  <0.001, in line with other cognitive aging studies (e.g.,  ). The groups did not differ from each other, when compared with norms appropriate to the participants' age group,   t  (32)\u200a=\u200a1.09,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.286. Crystallized intelligence (verbal knowledge) was assessed by means of the Spot-the-Word Test (SWT;  ). In accordance with Park et al.  , no age-related differences were found, both   t  \u22640.46,   p  \u22650.648. \n\nWith respect to the action sequences used in the experiment, all participants confirmed that they were well able to perform the movement exercises. In addition, 10 of the 34 participants were highly experienced in figure skating (six younger adults and four older adults). The six younger figure skaters (5 women,   M\u200a=\u200a  21.2,   SD  \u200a=\u200a2.23, range 18\u201324 years) spent on average 11.7 hours per week (  SD  \u200a=\u200a7.06) on ice for 14.8 years (  SD  \u200a=\u200a2.64). The four older figure skaters (3 women,   M  \u200a=\u200a56.0,   SD  \u200a=\u200a5.60, range 51\u201364 years) still performed the sport on a regular basis with 3.50 hours per week (  SD  \u200a=\u200a1.29) on ice for 35.0 years (  SD  \u200a=\u200a22.4). Two of them pursued a professional career for a period of 14.0 years (  SD  \u200a=\u200a6.69) with 14.8 hours per week (  SD  \u200a=\u200a7.41) on ice but ended it around the age of 22.7 years (  SD  \u200a=\u200a11.0). Characteristics of the sample divided by expertise group can be found in  . \n\n\n### Stimuli and design \n  \nThe same video stimuli were used as in the behavioral experiment reported in Diersch et al.  . Half of the videos featured classical figure skating elements (e.g., jumps, spins, and step sequences), all of which are listed in the official judging system for single skating specified by the International Skating Union (ISU,  ). The second set of videos featured simple movement exercises (e.g., running sequences, simple jumps, and spins) that were related to the figure skating sequences as much as possible (e.g., involving rotations) but should be feasible for nearly everyone. Each action was performed by a young male and female athlete (figure skating elements) or non-athlete (movement exercises). The two sets of action sequences were carefully matched with respect to viewing perspective, camera settings, and luminance. The figure skating sequences lasted 11.7 s on average (  SD  \u200a=\u200a3.70 s, range 7.40\u201322.2 s) and the movements exercise sequences 9.00 s on average (  SD  \u200a=\u200a0.81 s, range 8.00\u201310.9 s). In total, 48 different videos consisting of 12 different action sequences from two action categories that were performed by two actors were used in the fMRI experiment. \n\nEach video started with a fixation cross (1000 ms), followed by the beginning of an action sequence. Each action sequence was occluded once for 1000 ms by a grey rectangle at critical time points, for example, when the athlete reached the highest point during the jump. Before each occlusion, the figure skating sequences were visible for 6.24 s (  SD  \u200a=\u200a2.54 s, range 3.92\u201312.4 s) and the movement exercise sequences for 4.50 s (  SD  \u200a=\u200a0.76 s, range 3.08\u20135.92 s) on average,   t  (46)\u200a=\u200a3.23,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.003. Although the figure skating sequences were visible slightly longer than the movement exercise sequences before they were occluded, there is no reason to assume that this might have influenced the predictive processes in the observers during occlusion. Parkinson et al.   recently showed that the prediction of partly occluded actions is nearly unaffected by the length of the action sequences presented before occlusion suggesting that observers engage in prediction very quickly and automatically, even when only a small fraction of human motion is visible. In addition, the critical time frame during which participants were assumed to engage in the internally guided prediction was kept constant across the two action categories (i.e., the duration of occlusion). \n\nAfter an occlusion, the action sequences continued immediately. The continuations after occlusion were either congruent or incongruent (i.e., 600 ms too early or too late, see   for an example from each action category). Based on the results of the previous behavioral study, in which incongruent continuations of \u00b1400 ms and \u00b1800 ms were used and the prediction sensitivity of the different groups (i.e., response slopes) was analyzed, a temporal shift of \u00b1600 ms was chosen to examine age-related differences in the neural representation of the different action sequences at an intermediate level of difficulty (cf.,  ). \n   Details of experimental conditions during fMRI scanning.  \nDifferent action sequences of classical figure skating elements (A) and simple movement exercises (B) were presented. Each video clip started with a fixation cross (1000 ms), followed by the beginning of an action sequence. Then the occluder was presented for 1000 ms, followed by the continuation of the action, that was either congruent or incongruent (\u00b1600 ms). \n  \nThe action sequences were presented in full color with a resolution of 1024\u00d7768 pixels and a frame rate of 25 frames per second using a back projection system in which a LCD projection on a screen in the back of the scanner was reflected by a mirror placed above the participants' eyes. The software \u201cPresentation\u201d (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA) was used to control stimulus presentation and behavioral data collection. \n\n\n### Task and procedure \n  \nFor MRI scanning, participants were provided with ear-plugs and headphones to reduce scanner noise. Vision was corrected with MRI-compatible plastic goggles, if necessary. The participants' task was to judge for each observed action sequence whether the continuation after occlusion was correct or not by pressing on one of two response keys (left key: correct, right key: incorrect) with their index and middle finger on a response device that was placed in their right hand. Participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible as soon as the action sequence continued after occlusion. An event-related design was used to measure neural responses during the prediction of observed action sequences. \n\nPrior to the functional run, participants completed a short familiarization and training phase in the scanner during the acquisition of initial control sequences. This allowed them to accommodate to the task and the scanner environment. The familiarization started with two action sequences from each action category that were presented without occlusion and two action sequences from each action category that were presented with occlusion. These action sequences (four different action sequences from each action category) were also presented in a subsequent training phase, in which participants were required to perform the prediction task and received feedback of their performance. The training phase consisted of 16 trials per action category (32 in total). The remaining eight action sequences from each action category that were used in the actual test phase were presented once without occlusion before the functional run started. \n\nThe functional run, in which no feedback was given, consisted of 80 trials (8 action sequences\u00d72 actors\u00d75 repetitions) per action category (160 in total), in which the congruent and incongruent continuations were presented 40 times each. The action sequences were presented in blocks consisting of eight videos from one action category, in which no action was repeated after one another, resulting in 10 blocks from each category (20 in total). The continuations after occlusion were randomized separately with the restriction that the same continuation should not be presented more than two times in a row with a maximum of three congruent or incongruent continuations after one another. Within each action category, the congruent continuation was presented twice as often as the two incongruent continuations (i.e., too early and too late), which resulted in an equal number of congruent and incongruent continuations. The order of the videos and continuations was counterbalanced across participants. After each video block, a resting baseline showing a black screen with a grey fixation cross was presented for 8\u201312 s, pseudo-logarithmically distributed. The functional run lasted approximately 32 min. \n\nScanning was performed on a 3T TIM Trio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 12-channel head array coil. Functional images were acquired with a gradient echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with TR\u200a=\u200a2000 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a30 ms, flip angle\u200a=\u200a90\u00b0, and acquisition bandwidth\u200a=\u200a1815 Hz/pixel. The matrix acquired was 64\u00d764 voxels with a FoV of 192 mm\u00d7192 mm, resulting in an in-plane resolution of 3 mm\u00d73 mm. Twenty-six axial slices allowing for full-brain coverage were acquired in ascending order with slice thickness\u200a=\u200a4 mm and interslice gap\u200a=\u200a1 mm. Slices were oriented parallel to the bicommisural plane (AC-PC). A set of 1020 functional images was collected in a single functional run. In addition to functional imaging, high-resolution anatomical images were acquired using a T1-weighted 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence with selective water excitation and linear phase encoding  . Anatomical scanning was performed using a sagittal slice orientation with the following imaging parameters: TI\u200a=\u200a650 ms, TR\u200a=\u200a1300 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a3.5 ms, flip angle\u200a=\u200a10\u00b0, acquisition bandwidth\u200a=\u200a190 Hz/pixel, image matrix\u200a=\u200a256\u00d7240 voxels, FoV\u200a=\u200a240 mm\u00d7256 mm, spatial resolution\u200a=\u200a1 mm\u00d71 mm\u00d71 mm, 2 acquisitions. All MR datasets obtained in the present study are stored in anonymized form in a database of the MPI for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nData analysis was performed using the SPM8 software package (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK) with Matlab 7 (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Preprocessing of the EPI volumes included correction for motion and distortion, slice timing, as well as normalization to the standard MNI space using the unified segmentation approach  . Finally, spatial smoothing was done using an 8 mm full-width at half maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel. A two-level random effects approach as implemented in SPM8 was used for the statistical analyses. On the individual level, observed action category as a function of continuation after occlusion was modeled for each participant as separate events convolved with the standard hemodynamic response function: figure skating sequences that continued congruently, figure skating sequences that continued incongruently, movement exercise sequences that continued congruently, and movement exercise sequences that continued incongruently. This resulted in an equal number of relevant events in each condition. \n\nThe respective beginning of occlusion was defined as the target event in order to capture the time in which participants were assumed to engage in the internally guided prediction of the occluded action sequences. The results of our previous study suggested that the sensitivity in action prediction is lower in older adults compared to younger adults and in non-experts compared to experts as evidenced by a larger temporal range during which the continuations after occlusion were predominantly perceived as being just-in-time (i.e., resulting in higher error rates;  ). In the present study, we aimed to examine the neural effects of aging and sensorimotor experience during action prediction that might accompany these differences in behavioral efficiency. Thus, both correct and incorrect trials from each critical condition were incorporated in the fMRI analyses, which also ensured that the same number of events would be included in the analyses of the between-subject effects. In addition, given that neuroimaging data and behavioral data may both be considered as effects of an underlying functional difference (i.e., aging), excluding incorrect responses from the fMRI analysis might also remove age-related differences at the neural level (cf.,  ). The time of the button press was modeled as additional event to control for the effects of finger movements. Each baseline condition was modeled as a boxcar with the respective duration. Confounding factors from head movement, that is, six rotational and translational parameters from the rigid body transformation, obtained during image realignment, were included in the model as covariates of no interest. A high-pass filter at 1/100\u2009Hz was used to remove low-frequency fluctuations of the MR signal. Whole brain analyses were conducted using a voxel-wise threshold of   p  <0.001 and a minimum cluster size of 10 voxels. To control for false positive results, analyses focus on brain regions reaching a cluster-corrected significance threshold of   p  <0.05 (FWE corrected). \n\nOn the first level, the effects of each action category, collapsed across the continuations after occlusion, were compared to baseline and directly to each other, as were the interactions with continuation after occlusion by computing contrast images combining the parameter estimates of the corresponding experimental conditions. On the second level, those contrast images were fed into one-sample   t  -tests to perform inference statistics across the whole sample. Between-subject effects were tested using the general linear model as implemented in SPM. Due to the small sample size of figure skating experts in the two age-groups, two-sample   t  -tests instead of a full factorial design were used to examine the effects of age while correcting for non-sphericity through assuming measurement independence und unequal variance between groups. More specifically, differences between older and younger adults on the respective first-level comparisons were examined while taking experience in figure skating as a covariate of no interest into account. In addition, differences between figure skating experts and non-experts were tested accordingly while including age group as covariate of no interest. Although this did not allow for a direct investigation of interactions between age and experience in figure skating, the effects of motor familiarity were examined as a function of observed action category given that all of the participants were highly experienced with respect to the observed movement exercises. Significant group differences were further examined separately within the respective groups by means of one-sample   t  -tests of the individual contrast images. Anatomical localization of all activations was aided by the Anatomy Toolbox in SPM8   in combination with the Atlas of the Human Brain  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nPrediction performance was calculated as proportion of correct responses of every group on congruent and incongruent continuations for each action category with an equal number of trials for each condition. The proportion of correct responses was submitted into an ANOVA with action category (figure skating elements, movement exercises) and continuation after occlusion (congruent, incongruent) as repeated measures variables and age group (younger adults, older adults) and expertise group (figure skating experts, non-experts) as between-subject variables. The ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of continuation after occlusion,   F  (1,30)\u200a=\u200a11.1,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.002, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.271, and a significant main effect of age group,   F  (1,30)\u200a=\u200a18.8,   p  <0.001, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.385. This was modulated by a significant interaction between continuation after occlusion and age group,   F  (1,30)\u200a=\u200a4.99,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.033, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.143. The performance of the groups did not differ significantly when the actions continued congruently (younger adults:   M  \u200a=\u200a67.6%,   SD  \u200a=\u200a13.0%; older adults:   M  \u200a=\u200a61.7%,   SD  \u200a=\u200a17.6%),   t  (32)\u200a=\u200a1.12,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.271. On incongruent continuations, however, the performance of older adults (  M  \u200a=\u200a43.0%,   SD  \u200a=\u200a11.1%) was significantly lower than the performance of younger adults (  M  \u200a=\u200a62.4%,   SD  \u200a=\u200a9.96%),   t  (32)\u200a=\u200a5.36,   p  <0.001. Prediction performance of the two age groups did differ significantly from chance level for both types of continuation after occlusion, all   t  \u22652.45,   p  \u2264.028. In addition, a significant main effect of expertise group was found,   F  (1,30)\u200a=\u200a4.90,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.035, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.140, which was modulated by a significant interaction between action category, age group, and expertise group,   F  (1,30)\u200a=\u200a8.04,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.008, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.211, as well as a significant interaction between action category, continuation after occlusion, age group, and expertise group,   F  (1,30)\u200a=\u200a4.26,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.048, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.124. This implies that the performance of the groups differed as a function of observed action category and continuation after occlusion. \n\nTo further examine these interactions, follow-up ANOVAs with continuation after occlusion (congruent, incongruent) as repeated measures variable and age group (younger adults, older adults) and expertise group (figure skating experts, non-experts) as between-subject variables were conducted for each action category separately. For the figure skating elements, a significant main effect of continuation after occlusion,   F  (1,30)\u200a=\u200a8.32,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.007, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.217, confirmed that performance was better for congruent (  M  \u200a=\u200a65.0%,   SD  \u200a=\u200a18.3%) than incongruent continuations (  M  \u200a=\u200a53.3%,   SD  \u200a=\u200a16.3%). In addition, a significant main effect of age group,   F  (1,30)\u200a=\u200a18.5,   p  <0.001, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.382, and a main effect of expertise group,   F  (1,30)\u200a=\u200a4.54,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.041, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.132, was found. Thus, not only young age (younger adults:   M  \u200a=\u200a65.3%,   SD  \u200a=\u200a12.3%; older adults:   M  \u200a=\u200a51.4%,   SD  \u200a=\u200a7.70%) but also experience in figure skating (experts:   M  \u200a=\u200a66.0%,   SD  \u200a=\u200a16.9%; non-experts:   M  \u200a=\u200a56.3%,   SD  \u200a=\u200a9.21%) had a positive effect on prediction accuracy during the observation of figure skating elements. \n\nThe follow-up ANOVA for the movement exercises also showed a significant main effect of continuation after occlusion,   F  (1,30)\u200a=\u200a11.2,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.002, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.272, and a significant main effect of age group,   F  (1,30)\u200a=\u200a11.1,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.002, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.270. As in the overall analysis, this was modulated by a significant interaction between continuation after occlusion and age group,   F  (1,30)\u200a=\u200a6.17,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.019, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.170. Older (  M  \u200a=\u200a63.6%,   SD  \u200a=\u200a18.3%) and younger adults (  M  \u200a=\u200a66.0%,   SD  \u200a=\u200a11.0%) did not differ significantly in their performance on congruent continuations,   t  (32)\u200a=\u200a.46,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.648. On incongruent continuations, older adults' performance dropped significantly (  M  \u200a=\u200a42.9%,   SD  \u200a=\u200a12.8%) compared to younger adults (  M  \u200a=\u200a63.3%,   SD  \u200a=\u200a8.80%),   t  (32)\u200a=\u200a5.51,   p  <0.001. \n\nThe results show that older adults predicted the observed action sequences less precisely compared to younger adults, even when they were familiar with the observed actions. They incorrectly perceived incongruent continuations predominantly as still being congruent, which is in line with the results of our previous study suggesting that the temporal sensitivity in action prediction declines with age (cf.,  ). Moreover, sensorimotor experience in figure skating exerted a positive influence on the performance of experts compared to non-experts of the same age group during the observation of the figure skating elements. Together, the behavioral data suggest that all groups attended to the action sequences and engaged in action prediction in the manner that was hypothesized during fMRI scanning. \n\n\n### Neuroimaging results \n  \n#### Effects of predicted action category \n  \nThe prediction of both types of action sequences compared to baseline resulted in bilateral activity in frontal, parietal, occipitotemporal, and occipital regions as well as in some subcortical structures (  and  ). The direct comparison between the action categories revealed remarkable differences. Compared to movement exercises, the visual cortex and the medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were more engaged during the prediction of figure skating elements (  and  ). In contrast, the premotor, parietal and occipitotemporal regions of the AON were preferentially activated during the prediction of movement exercises compared to figure skating elements (  and  ). For the movement exercises only, the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) differentiated between incongruent and congruent continuations after occlusion ( ). Thus, different regions of the AON showed selectivity for the generally familiar movement exercises whereas visual and frontal areas responded stronger to the less familiar figure skating elements. \n   Main effects of observed action category collapsed across the whole sample.  \nBrain regions that showed greater activation during the prediction of figure skating elements (A) and movement exercises (B) compared to baseline, and direct comparisons between the action categories (C and D).

Compared to younger adults, older adults showed a greater recruitment of the prestriate and extrastriate visual cortex, bilaterally centered in the cuneus, for the figure skating elements as well as the movement exercises compared to the baseline condition (  and  ). During the prediction of movement exercises, older adults engaged an additional region in the right posterior hippocampus extending to the right caudate more than younger adults (  and  ). The reverse contrasts did not reveal any significant clusters that were more activated in younger adults compared to older adults. This confirms that older adults recruited areas beyond the AON, which younger adults did not, during action prediction. \n   Brain regions more activated in older adults compared to younger adults.  \nPatterns of brain activation during the prediction of figure skating elements (A) and movement exercises (B) compared to baseline.

To examine this interaction further, a comparison between both types of action sequences was conducted within each age group. The results are illustrated in the upper panels of   and a complete listing of suprathreshold activations in each age group can be found in  . This analysis revealed that the interaction was due to the younger adults, who showed a greater recruitment of the visual cortex that extended to the PCC and the thalamostriatal network during the prediction of the figure skating elements compared to movement exercises. In older adults, the same comparison revealed only the visual cortex and the medial OFC. In contrast, premotor, parietal and occipitotemporal regions of the AON that were largely confined to the right hemisphere were more activated in younger adults when they predicted movement exercises compared to figure skating elements. In older adults, similar regions were found for the same contrast, although mainly bilaterally distributed.

Experts and non-experts did not differ significantly from each other for both types of action sequences compared to baseline. Interestingly, a significant interaction between predicted action category and expertise group was found again in the left caudate and the left thalamus (  and  ). \n   Interaction between predicted action category and expertise group.  \nBrain regions that showed greater activation in figure skating experts (left panels) and non-experts (right panels) during the prediction of figure skating elements compared to movement exercises (A) and vice versa (B).

A complete listing of suprathreshold activations in each expertise group is provided in  . This analysis revealed that the interaction was due to the figure skating experts, who engaged the bilateral caudate and thalamus together with the early visual cortex more during the prediction of figure skating elements compared to movement exercises. The non-experts, in contrast, showed a greater recruitment of the whole visual cortex and the superior frontal gyrus for this comparison. The reverse contrast did not reveal any suprathreshold activations in experts whereas non-experts engaged premotor, parietal and occipitotemporal regions of the AON during the prediction of movement exercises compared to figure skating elements. No expertise-related activation differences that reached cluster-corrected significance were found for the interactions between action category and continuation after occlusion. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study aimed to identify age-related differences in neural activation patterns during the prediction of action sequences that varied in their degree of motor familiarity (i.e., classical figure skating elements and simple movement exercises). Further, the possible role and consequences of neural scaffolding in older adults during action prediction was explored through the inclusion of observers who differed in their degree of sensorimotor experience with the observed actions. In addition, we aimed to clarify the link between AON activity and motor familiarity during action prediction in general. With respect to the AON, our results show that activity in different regions of this network was modulated by sensorimotor experience with the observed actions. Whereas the sensorimotor and occipitotemporal cortices that compose the AON showed more activation for the generally more familiar movement exercises, the prediction of figure skating elements resulted in increased engagement of the visual cortex and the medial OFC. Compared to younger adults, older adults recruited visual regions while performing the prediction task. Older adults also showed greater recruitment of the hippocampus and caudate when predicting actions that were familiar to them. During prediction of the figure skating elements, the caudate together with the thalamus seemed to play an important role in younger observers. In addition, our data indicate that this might have been similarly the case in observers who possessed sensorimotor experience in figure skating. However, due to the small sample size of the figure skating experts in particular, the interpretation of these findings has to be taken with caution. Each of these results and their implications will be considered in turn. \n\n### Modulation of AON activity as a function of predicted action category \n  \nThe prediction of both types of action sequences was accompanied by robust AON activation compared to baseline, in line with many others studies showing that this network is involved in the anticipation of observed actions (e.g.,  \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nThe direct comparison between the different action sequences revealed that AON activation was increased for the movement exercises, which is in accordance with other studies that found enhanced activity in these regions for familiar actions compared to actions that are not in motor repertoire of the observer (e.g.,  ,  ,  \u2013 ). However, the precise relation between level of familiarity and level of activation in the AON is still a matter of debate because some studies also demonstrated decreased AON activity for familiar compared to unfamiliar actions (e.g.,  \u2013 ). To reconcile such seemingly discrepant findings, Cross et al.   have proposed a nonlinear relationship between motor familiarity in the observer and AON activity that follows a u-shaped function. According to this model, highly unfamiliar actions produce a greater prediction error than actions of intermediate familiarity. This greater prediction error results in increased AON activity due to increased processing demands between the different regions of the AON. In contrast, highly familiar actions might also lead to enhanced AON activity compared to actions of intermediate familiarity, but for a different reason. Here, participants have generated extremely exact predictions due to a high degree of motor expertise. Any small deviations from such precise predictions might amplify the response within the AON if the sensory input does not exactly match the predicted consequences. \n\nAccording to this proposal, here we might have expected increased AON activity for the less familiar figure skating elements in comparison to the generally familiar movement exercises. These discrepancies in the present as well as across previous studies might be related to the respective definition of unfamiliar actions. For example, unfamiliar actions might be defined as those that are not regularly seen, but are generally executable by the observer, such as unusual hand gestures. They might be also defined as not in the motor repertoire of the observer at all, such as figure skating elements for observers who have never ice skated before. In addition, for movement exercises, only one region of the AON, the pSTS, showed stronger activity when observing incongruent compared to congruent continuations after occlusion. Such a finding is in line with evidence that the STS is involved in the perception of biological motion and contains cells with predictive properties that are sensitive to movements that deviate from expectations  ,  . One should also note that this activation was close to a occipitotemporal region previously identified as the extrastriate body area (EBA;  ). The EBA has been implicated in the evaluation of biomechanical constraints in visual body processing in action-related contexts (e.g.,  ,  ). In addition, higher activity in this region was found in experts compared to non-experts during action prediction  . This suggests that regions within but also beyond the AON might be involved in action prediction depending on the characteristics of the observed actions and the observers' level of motor familiarity. We therefore propose an adaptation to the model put forth by Cross et al.   that also considers unfamiliar actions that the observer cannot reproduce without extensive training in comparison to unfamiliar actions for which the observed kinematics might be inferable and at least to some extent reproducible (see  ). \n   Adapted model of the hypothesized relationship between motor familiarity and activity in the AON.    \nWithin this adapted model, a match between observed and predicted representation of highly familiar actions should be associated with a small prediction error and, thus, intermediate AON activity. Less familiar actions might result in higher AON activity due to a less precise prediction of them that needs to be constantly updated based on the actual sensory input to minimize a larger prediction error. The use of these predictive representations might become less efficient the less familiar an observed action is, until an internal action representation will not be present at all. In these cases, the observed actions might be represented in a rather multimodal way that is supported by the recruitment of regions beyond the classical AON (cf.,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nIn line with this, our data show that the less familiar figure skating elements were processed more in the visual cortex and in the medial OFC, a region that is known to be involved in adaptive decision making in unpredictable situations  ,  . Although special care was taken to match both types of action sequences as much as possible in terms of involved body kinematics, the figure skating elements were executed at a considerably faster speed than the movement exercises. This might have skewed the perceptual complexity and in turn biased the demands on the predictive processes in the observer to some extent. However, the activation in the medial OFC implies that differences in low-level visual features might only partially explain the observed differences in neural activity. This assumption is further supported by the observed group differences in the present study that are discussed below. In addition, given that the action sequences in the present study fulfilled a rather dichotomous criterion with respect to motor familiarity (i.e., either generally familiar or highly unfamiliar actions), further research is clearly warranted that tests the implications of the proposed model more directly. For example, including actions from a continuous range of familiarity would be useful in order to gain a better understanding of how individual differences in motor (and/or visual) familiarity may modulate predictive processing during action observation (see also   for another variation of familiarity). Although beyond the scope of this study, the precise level of AON involvement most likely depends on the specific task demands as well. For instance, whether an action is just passively observed or whether the observer intents to infer its meaning or predicts its time course poses important differences in the neural processing demands in the observer (cf.,  ,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Action prediction in the aging brain \n  \nWith respect to the AON in particular, we did not find age-related activation differences that reached cluster-corrected significance as in Nedelko et al.  . However, the comparison between the action categories within each age group indicated that AON activity was mainly right lateralized in younger adults and bilaterally active in older adults during the prediction of movement exercises compared to figure skating elements. This pattern of activity change has been observed frequently in different cognitive domains and is referred to as hemispheric asymmetry reduction in old adults (HAROLD), suggesting that cortical recruitment under similar conditions tends to be less lateralized in older adults  . \n\nThe results further show that older adults recruited regions beyond the AON, which younger adults did not, while performing the task. No matter what type of action sequence was observed, when comparing to the baseline condition, older adults showed greater recruitment of prestriate and extrastriate visual cortex compared to younger adults. In younger adults, these early visual areas, such as V2, have been shown to be recruited in mental imagery tasks that require the anticipation of objects or scenes that one is about to perceive  . In older adults, however, evidence suggests that the neural representation of sensory input becomes less distinct with age, arguing for an age-related neural dedifferentiation in relevant areas  ,  . In line with this assumption, behavioral evidence suggests that the correlation between sensory and cognitive abilities increases with age  . The increased activation in the visual cortex might therefore partly reflect less specific sensory representations of the observed actions among older adults. These less distinct sensory representations might have been matched with motor representations that also get less selective with age (cf.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nHowever, when examined separately, the non-experts in figure skating also demonstrated greater recruitment of a large cluster in the visual cortex during prediction of figure skating elements compared to movement exercises. In addition, Olsson et al.   and Wright et al.   found higher activation in very similar visual areas in non-experts compared to experts during action imagery and observation. This implies that the engagement of visual regions in older adults cannot be solely explained by neural dedifferentiation in the aging mind. The findings rather suggest that the brain's response to challenges that are due to aging or the exposure to unfamiliar material may indeed be similar during the prediction of others' actions (cf.,  ). \n\nOlder adults showed additional activation within the medial OFC during the prediction of the figure skating elements compared to movement exercises. The OFC has been shown to play an important role in the top-down modulation of visual processing through the generation of initial predictions about likely interpretations of the visual input in younger adults  . In their fMRI study on expert-novice differences during the prediction of basketball throws, Abreu et al.   recently found that orbito-frontal regions are specifically linked to correct action prediction in observers who are not familiar with the shown actions. Thus, one might speculate that also the older adults of the present study relied more on these higher-order regions that are involved in adaptive decision-making during the prediction of actions that were less familiar to them. \n\nFor the movement exercises, compared to younger adults, older adults recruited an additional cluster in the right hippocampus extending to the caudate compared to baseline. Neurobiological evidence suggests that these regions form a functional network that is involved in flexible decision-making with the hippocampus generating predictive (spatial) representations and the caudate learning and anticipating action-outcome contingencies (e.g.,  ,  ). In addition, hippocampal activation has been found during episodic imagination of the future that is based on a recombination of past episodic events  ,  . Recent evidence suggests that this functional differentiation, with the hippocampus mediating explicit/declarative memory and the striatum mediating implicit/procedural memory, decreases with advancing age  . Thus, if older adults in the present study were familiar with the observed actions, they seemed to use learned action-outcome contingencies as well as multimodal representations of these actions stored in episodic memory to evaluate the sensory input. Age-related declines in neural selectivity in these regions together with a less efficient use of the own sensorimotor system might in turn have resulted in difficulties to recreate the observed action sequences in necessary detail in order to predict their exact time-course. This is further supported by findings that the reconstruction of episodic details comprising past and future events is reduced in older adults, which is linked to activity changes in medial temporal regions  ,  . \n\nTaken together, the data provide evidence for age-related neural scaffolding in relevant areas during action prediction that is modulated by the degree of motor familiarity with the observed actions. Older adults may have relied predominantly on the visual dynamics of the observed actions during the occlusion period instead of effectively exploiting the sensorimotor matching properties of the AON. Even though it was beyond the scope of this study to examine the neural correlates of successful action prediction within the single groups, it may provide important insights on how the process of action prediction is generally implemented in the aging brain. In the present study, neural activity was measured at the beginning of occlusion to capture the time in which participants were assumed to internally predict the occluded action sequences. Their explicit decision about the continuation after occlusion, however, occurred several seconds later. Future research is therefore needed in order to specify how age-related changes at the neural level are associated with declines in behavioral performance and how predictive coding may actually change with advancing age. In the context of predictive coding, it is argued that predictive processing during perception takes place at multiple levels in the cortical hierarchy (cf.,  ,  ,  ). For example, dopamine has recently been implicated in modulating the precision of prediction errors (or uncertainty) at different levels in the sensorimotor hierarchy  . Changes in neurotransmitter systems such as the dopaminergic system have been linked to neural dedifferentiation in older adults  . Thus, one might speculate that the age-related loss in selectivity in sensory representations and/or prior expectations reflects changes in neurotransmitter function in the aging brain resulting in deficiencies in minimizing prediction errors during action prediction. As Park and Reuter-Lorenz   noted, an efficient task performance relies on an efficient neural circuitry. To the extent that the functionality of these specialized networks declines with age and scaffolding takes place, task performance is likely to get less specific as well. One should also note that this relation presumably depends on additional factors, for example, the connectivity between different brain regions or hemispheres (cf.,  ,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Involvement of the caudate in action prediction \n  \nDuring the prediction of the figure skating elements compared to movement exercises, a cluster in the caudate extending to the thalamus was more engaged in younger adults compared to older adults. The activation comprised additionally the left PCC for this direction of the contrast. The caudate is connected to various regions in the cerebral cortex, including inferior frontal and inferior parietal regions of the AON  \u2013 . Activity in the caudate is typically linked to performance monitoring in ambiguous contexts, possibly via representing and updating the value of future actions (i.e., the reward-prediction error; e.g.,  \u2013 ). Interestingly, this reward-related recruitment has been found not only in experiential but also in observational instrumental learning tasks  . Thus, the caudate appears to be an ideal candidate for neural scaffolding in younger adults during action prediction in conditions of higher difficulty (i.e., lower motor familiarity). In line with this, Schiffer and Schubotz   showed that the caudate is involved in prediction errors that are not related to some kind of reward, but violate predictions about which movements should follow after a certain cue in a movement sequence during action observation. The study also reported activation in the PCC for unexpected movement continuations, a region which has been associated with fast visuospatial orientation in unpredictable contexts  . Accordingly, PCC activity among younger adults of the present study might have reflected visuospatial monitoring of the more ambiguous figure skating elements. \n\nOur data further show that in figure skating experts compared to non-experts a very similar cluster in the thalamostriatal network was more activated during the prediction of the figure skating elements compared to the movement exercises. Although there was no main effect of action category in the present behavioral data, the study reported by Diersch et al.  , which used a more fine-grained psychophysical paradigm, showed that the movement exercises were easier to predict than the figure skating elements even for figure skating experts. Due to the small sample size of the experts in the present study, however, this finding needs further confirmation from studies comprising larger sample sizes. The consistency of the results across groups that are in line with previous research still implies that higher prediction errors might not only modulate activity in the AON but also engage the caudate (together with the thalamus), possibly to adjust and optimize less precise predictions that are generated in the AON. As it was demonstrated in the putamen for stimulus-response behaviors, the caudate might similarly modulate information-transfer between visual and motor areas in action-outcome behaviors (cf.,  ). The fact that the caudate was also active together with the hippocampus in older adults during the prediction of the movement exercises emphasizes again its importance during the prediction of actions that are rather ambiguous for the respective observer. Notably, hippocampal activity has been recently linked to the adaptation of stored action representations in younger adults in conditions in which previously encountered action sequences are repeatedly observed in a new, divergent version  . Whether the hippocampus might fulfill a similar role in older adults during the prediction of familiar actions poses an important question for future research in order to examine the role of observational learning in older adults in action-related contexts. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe present study has demonstrated that generating predictive representations of observed actions engages a distributed network in the brain, depending on the characteristics of the observer and the type of observed actions. Based on the predictive coding account, a model was outlined that considers AON activity in relation to the level of motor familiarity in the observer. Moreover, the results underline a role of the caudate during action prediction in ambiguous contexts. In older adults, evidence was found for neural dedifferentiation in relevant areas and engagement of additional regions in line with STAC  . Older adults might be considered, metaphorically speaking, as non-experts in previously well-known domains due to internal action representations that become less precise with advancing age. Thus, emphasizing alternative (visual/mnemonic) strategies in training and intervention programs targeted at older adults may provide a promising alternative that supports successful performance in everyday life despite changes in sensorimotor processing. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone-0064195-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tYounger adults\tOlder adults\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\t(n\u200a=\u200a19)\t(n\u200a=\u200a15)\nHandedness score\t92.4 (9.28)\t92.5 (9.60)\nMMSE score\t-\t29.2 (0.78)\nYears of education\t15.7 (3.25)\t14.9 (3.11)\nDSST raw score\t86.0 (14.2)\t61.3 (11.0)\nDSST standardized score\t11.6 (2.77)\t10.7 (2.29)\nSWT raw score\t32.4 (3.24)\t32.9 (2.10)\nSWT standardized score\t0.43 (0.57)\t0.47 (0.44)\n### Caption\nCharacteristics of the sample divided by age group.\n### Footer\nValues represent mean scores and standard deviations (parenthesized).

Human fMRI studies investigating diet effects on neural processing of food cues could aid in understanding altered brain activation in conditions of under\u2010 and overnutrition. In this preliminary study, we examined brain activity changes in response to 10\u00a0days of high\u2010calorie\u2010diet (HCD), followed by\u00a010\u00a0days of fasting, hypothesizing that HCD would decrease activation in homeostatic and reward regions, while fasting would increase activation in homeostatic/reward regions and decrease activation of self\u2010control regions. Seven adults completed fMRI scanning during a food\u2010cue paradigm (high\u2010 and low\u2010calorie food images and nonfood objects), pre\u2010 and post\u201010\u2010day HCD. Six adults completed fMRI scanning pre\u2010 and post\u201010\u2010day fasting. BOLD\u00a0response changes for contrasts of interest\u00a0pre\u2010 versus post\u2010intervention in regions of interest were examined (peak\u2010level significance set at p(FWE)<0.05). BMI increased by 6.8% and decreased by 8.1% following HCD and fasting, respectively. Following HCD, BOLD response in the hypothalamus (homeostatic control), was attenuated at trend level in response to high\u2010 versus low\u2010calorie foods. Following fasting, BOLD response to food versus objects in inhibitory\u2010control areas (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) was reduced, whereas the activation of homeostatic (hypothalamus), gustatory, and reward brain areas (anterior insula and orbitofrontal cortex) increased. Overfeeding and fasting for 10\u00a0days modulate brain activity in response to food stimuli, suggesting that in healthy adults, changes in energy balance affect saliency and reward value of food cues. Future studies are required to understand this interaction in states of unhealthy weight. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nThe regulation of appetite and food intake is a complex process governed by neural and endocrine signaling in response to energy balance, motivational drive, interoceptive cues, as well as cognitive and attentional processing of external sensory cues. Human neuroimaging studies demonstrate that in healthy individuals, states of hunger and satiety can modulate and bias the neural processing of visual food cues of different caloric value. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the brain response to high\u2010 versus low\u2010calorie visual food images after an overnight fast, healthy participants demonstrated hyperactivation of the hypothalamus, the primary homeostatic control region, as well as brain areas involved in visual processing (inferior temporal visual cortex), attention and motor control (posterior parietal cortex and premotor cortex, and memory (hippocampus) (Cornier et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Additionally, activation in reward\u2010 and interoception\u2010related brain areas such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the insular cortex is increased in response to palatable food images following a short\u2010term (3\u00a0hr) fast (Frank et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) as well as an overnight fast (Fuhrer et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Goldstone et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) with positive correlations between the duration of caloric deprivation (1 to 16\u00a0hr) and degree of neural activation in the OFC, as well as brain areas of attention (anterior cingulate cortex), motivation (putamen), and motor control (precentral gyrus) (Stice et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nIn comparison, satiation produces a robust decrease in food\u2010cue elicited brain activity in reward\u2010related areas (amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and anterior fusiform gyrus) (LaBar et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) as well as increased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), an area primarily involved in decision making and exerting inhibitory\u2010control over hedonic drives (Thomas et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Interestingly, when overfed by 30% above caloric need for 2\u00a0days and then evaluated after an overnight fast, healthy\u2010weight individuals demonstrated attenuated hypothalamic activation to high\u2010calorie visual food images compared with robust activation seen after 2\u00a0days of controlled eucaloric diet (Cornier et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), suggesting that interoceptive signals reflecting physiological needs appropriately bias the cognitive perception of visual food images (Burgess et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nWhile there is ample evidence that healthy\u2010weight individuals exhibit changes in brain activation in response to visual food images following an overnight fast and postprandially, well\u2010controlled studies examining fMRI brain activation in response to prolonged (>2\u00a0days) fasting and high\u2010calorie diet interventions resulting in measurable, acute weight changes in humans are lacking. Such studies could improve our understanding of the adaptive neuronal mechanisms in response to more prolonged caloric restriction and overfeeding resulting in weight changes, and thus create the foundations to better understand the neuronal perturbations that occur at extremes of eating behavior, for example, chronic starvation and hyperphagia. \n\nThe aim of the present pilot study was to examine changes in fMRI activation in response to 10\u00a0days of overfeeding intended to result in 7%\u201310% weight gain, followed by 10\u00a0days of complete caloric deprivation, separated by a 2\u2010week interval of unsupervised diet. We hypothesized that in healthy men and women, excessive caloric consumption leading to acute weight gain would result in diminished fMRI activation of homeostatic and reward regions important for food processing specifically in response to high\u2010calorie food images, whereas complete caloric deprivation resulting in acute weight loss would lead to increased activation of homeostasis and reward areas and decreased activation of inhibitory control brain regions in response to images of food varying in caloric content. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nHealthy, adult participants were recruited as part of a multidisciplinary study designed to examine the effects of acute weight changes on skeletal and marrow adipose tissue remodeling. All subjects included in the current fMRI study performed both diet interventions\u2014overfeeding and fasting, in the same order (for details, see Procedure). Seven subjects (2 men, 5 women; mean age\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0  SEM  : 31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0years; mean BMI\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0  SEM  : 26.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0kg/m ) completed fMRI scanning pre\u2010 and post\u201010\u2010day HCD. Six subjects (1 man; 5 women; mean age: 29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9\u00a0years; mean BMI: 26.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0kg/m ) completed fMRI scanning pre\u2010 and post\u201010\u2010day fast. Overall, three participants performed all four scans (prior and following each diet intervention). Subjects were recruited through online advertisements. Inclusion criteria included 101%\u2013120% of ideal body weight (to avoid a potential negative impact due to the fasting intervention) and regular menses for women (cycling every 21\u201335\u00a0days). Exclusion criteria included a history of chronic illness, untreated thyroid dysfunction, history of an eating disorder, active substance abuse, abnormal transaminase levels (AST/ALT), hypokalemia (potassium\u00a0<\u00a03.5\u00a0mEq/L), pregnancy, breastfeeding, and MRI contraindications. Due to the main study aim to investigate bone health, participants taking medications known to affect bone metabolism (e.g., systemic steroids and immunosuppressants) were excluded from the study. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nThis study was approved by the Partners HealthCare Institutional Review Board and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was preregistered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02482519). All subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation, obtained by a licensed physician investigator or nurse practitioner. Subjects were admitted to the Translational and Clinical Research Center (TCRC) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for an outpatient screening visit including a medical history, physical exam, and blood work to determine eligibility. Eligible subjects were admitted to the TCRC for the main study visits which occurred over the course of 35\u00a0days. The main study included an initial 10\u2010day inpatient HCD weight\u2010gain period (days 1\u201311), followed by a 13\u201318\u00a0day outpatient unsupervised diet (\u201cwash\u2010out,\u201d days 11\u201324), followed by a 10\u2010day inpatient fast (days 25\u201335). During the HCD intervention, subjects were fed a high fat/high carbohydrate diet individually tailored to result in a 7%\u201310% weight gain, planned and supervised by an experienced bionutritionist at the TCRC. The amount of daily calories ordered for each participant was established by calculating the Basal Metabolic Rate (using the Mifflin St Jeor equation) and adding 20% on top of the final result to achieve a positive energy balance (Frankenfield et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). During the overfeeding intervention, the study nutritionist examined the daily percent change in body weight and evaluated meal completion to assess the need for diet modifications. When participants were able to fully complete their meal but did not gain enough weight, food items were altered to increase the daily caloric consumption. When participants were struggling to complete their meal, a high\u2010calorie milkshake was added in addition to their meal. After a wash\u2010out period, subjects were readmitted to the TCRC for a 10\u2010day fast, using a validated protocol (Fazeli et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). During fasting, subjects were given water ad libitum, 20\u00a0meq of oral potassium chloride daily to prevent hypokalemia, and a multivitamin. During the inpatient portions of the study, subjects were free to move around the TCRC or remain in their room where they had a TV. Participants remained inpatient for 24hr following the fasting intervention to gradually increase caloric intake under medical supervision. All subjects were blinded to their weights during the entire study. \n\n\n### Functional MRI Paradigm \n  \nBrain fMRI was performed after an overnight fast on the first and last day of both diet interventions. A urine HCG test was completed in females prior to scanning. fMRI scanning was performed during a well\u2010established food motivation paradigm (Holsen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) programmed through Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems). Briefly, at each visit, subjects viewed 100 high\u2010calorie food stimuli, 100 low\u2010calorie food stimuli, 100 non\u2010food\u2010related household objects, and 100 fixation stimuli (blurred images) in a block design, with each stimulus presented for 3\u00a0s. Subjects were instructed to press a button when pictures changed to ensure attention. A total of five 4\u2010min runs with five images in each block and 16 blocks in each run were completed at each visit. At each of the pre and postintervention visits, subjects viewed images from one of two parallel versions of the task (each with 400 unique images from the conditions above), with order randomized across subjects. \n\n\n### MRI Acquisition Parameters \n  \nMRI data were acquired using a Siemens 3T Trio scanner (Siemens) at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. A gradient\u2010echo EPI pulse sequence was used (33 contiguous oblique\u2010axial slices, 4\u2010mm thick, TR/TE\u00a0=\u00a02000/30\u00a0ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0, FOV\u00a0=\u00a0200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0200\u00a0mm, 120 total images per run). A sagittal 3D SPGR (T1\u2010weighted) sequence was acquired (TR/TE\u00a0=\u00a02350/3.39\u00a0ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a07\u00b0, FOV\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256\u00a0mm, effective slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a01.33\u00a0mm with 128 slices) for co\u2010registration between structural and functional datasets. Head movements were restricted with foam cushions. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nfMRI data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging). Volumes were realigned and unwarped with phase correction provided from the fieldmap, normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute MNI152 brain template, re\u2010sampled to 3\u00a0mm isotropic, and smoothed with a 6\u00a0mm Gaussian kernel. Outliers in the global mean image time series (threshold: 3.5   SD  ) and movement (threshold: 0.8\u00a0mm, scan\u2010to\u2010scan movement) were detected using ART ( ) and entered as nuisance regressors in the single\u2010subject level GLM. Masks excluding voxels outside the brain were applied to ensure that voxels in regions with signal dropout were not arbitrarily excluded. For the block design, each stimulus type was modeled using a boxcar function convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Contrasts of interest (food\u00a0>\u00a0objects; high\u2010calorie food\u00a0>\u00a0low\u2010calorie food) from the first\u2010level analysis were tested using linear contrasts and SPM t\u2010maps, then submitted to second\u2010level random\u2010effects group analysis. The contrast of high\u2010calorie food\u00a0>\u00a0low\u2010calorie food was chosen as the contrast of interest for the pre\u2010 versus post\u2010HCD analysis based on the prediction that this contrast would be uniquely sensitive to changes induced by the high\u2010calorie diet foods consumed during the HCD intervention. Conversely, the food\u00a0>\u00a0objects contrast was selected for the pre\u2010 versus post\u2010fasting analysis based on the expectation that this more general contrast would be specifically sensitive to changes induced by lack of intake of any food during the fasting intervention. Effects of interest at the group level were examined using paired   t  \u2010tests (pre\u2010 vs. post\u2010HCD; pre\u2010 vs. post\u2010fast). For transparency, post hoc complementary analyses were completed to examine changes in response to food\u00a0>\u00a0objects contrast for the pre\u2010 to post\u2010HCD intervention, and changes in response to high\u2010calorie food\u00a0>\u00a0low\u2010calorie food contrast for the pre\u2010 to post\u2010fasting intervention. For each set of analyses, region of interest (ROI) analyses were performed using small volume correction which corrects for the number of voxels within an anatomical ROI. Multiple comparisons were controlled using a combination of cluster extent (k\u00a0\u2265\u00a05 in hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens; k\u00a0\u2265\u00a020 in other ROIs) and   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05 FWE\u2010corrected thresholds. ROI were selected a priori and included the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, OFC, amygdala, insula, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Anatomical borders of the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, OFC, amygdala, and insula were defined using a manually segmented MNI brain [based on methods established by the Center for Morphometric Analysis at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School (Makris et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ,  ). Anatomical borders of the DLPFC were derived from Middle Frontal Gyrus region as defined by the AAL atlas (Tzourio\u2010Mazoyer et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Average parameter estimates within each ROI for each participant were extracted from clusters within each ROI meeting statistical thresholds using the Region of Interest Extraction Toolbox (REX) and exported to SPSS (v19, Chicago, IL) for graphical depiction. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nMean BMI increased by 6.8%\u00b10.7 following HCD, was almost fully restored at the end of the wash\u2010out period and decreased by 8.1%\u00b10.6 following the fasting intervention (see Table\u00a0 ). Following HCD intervention, hypothalamic BOLD response was attenuated at a trend level in response to high\u2010 versus low\u2010calorie food images (Table\u00a0 ; Figure\u00a0 ). There were no regions in which BOLD response to all food images   (high\u2010calorie\u00a0+\u00a0low\u2010calorie)   versus objects changed significantly following HCD intervention. \n  \nMeans and ranges of BMIs before and after each diet intervention \n      \nChange in BOLD response to food stimuli following 10\u2010day HCD and 10\u2010day fast \n      \nChange in Neural Response to High\u2010 versus Low\u2010calorie Food before and after HCD.

Conversely, following the fasting intervention, BOLD response to food versus objects increased significantly in the OFC and insula and at a trend level in the hypothalamus (Table\u00a0 ; Figure\u00a0 b\u2010d). The 10\u2010day fast did not induce significant BOLD changes in a priori ROIs in response to high\u2010 versus low\u2010calorie food images. \n  \nChange in Neural Response to Food versus Objects before and after Fasting.

Specifically, following an overfeeding intervention associated with a mean BMI increase of 6.8%, subjects exhibited trend\u2010level attenuated hypothalamic activation, reflecting homeostatic control, in response to high\u2010 versus low\u2010calorie foods. Conversely, 10\u00a0days of fasting induced a mean BMI decrease of 8.1%, reduced activation in response to food images versus objects in inhibitory control areas (DLPFC), and increased activation in homeostatic (hypothalamus), interoception (anterior insula), and reward valuation (orbitofrontal cortex) brain regions. There is strong evidence that in healthy individuals, fMRI activation in food motivation brain areas is altered in states of short\u2010term hunger and satiety (Cornier et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Frank et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Goldstone et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; LaBar et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). However, the majority of these studies examined the effects of an overnight fast or a meal on the brain response to food cues and were not associated with a change in weight status. Our novel study design allowed an evaluation of the neurobiological response to visual food images following a relatively prolonged diet intervention resulting in significant acute weight changes, thus more closely mimicking extremes of disordered eating leading to unhealthy weight and associated co\u2010morbidities. \n\nIn our study, following 10\u00a0days of overfeeding, subjects demonstrated trend\u2010level attenuated hypothalamic activation in response to high\u2010calorie versus low\u2010calorie food images. The hypothalamus is critically involved in integrating internal homeostatic signals with external cues and input from high\u2010order brain regions important for emotional, cognitive, and reward processing and it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity (Roth et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Thaler et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). More specifically, rodent studies show that caloric excess triggers an inflammatory hypothalamic response altering the intricate neuroendocrine hypothalamic network regulating appetite and energy balance (Razolli et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Hypothalamic inflammation is associated with the proliferation of glial cells which can be detected in human structural MRI studies. Signs of hypothalamic gliosis and inflammation can be seen in adults and even children with obesity and are positively associated with adiposity (Schur et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Sewaybricker et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). fMRI studies provide further insight into the hypothalamic perturbations associated with obesity. While healthy\u2010weight individuals demonstrate dose\u2010dependent reductions in hypothalamic fMRI signal following glucose ingestion (Smeets et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) and in response to high\u2010calorie food images following overfeeding for 2\u00a0days (Cornier et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), individuals with overweight/obesity do not show the same hypothalamic response (Cornier et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Matsuda et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Our finding of trend\u2010level attenuated hypothalamic activation in response to high\u2010 versus low\u2010calorie food images following 10\u00a0days of caloric excess, suggests that differential hypothalamic responsivity to external food cues representing divergent rewarding value is maintained following 10\u00a0days of overfeeding associated with weight gain. These findings are of interest since rodent studies show that 3\u00a0days of high\u2010fat diet are sufficient to induce proinflammatory hypothalamic response associated with altered mitochondrial function and synaptic plasticity as well as impaired functional and molecular activation of insulin\u2010signaling pathways (Jais & Bruning,\u00a0 ; McLean et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; De Souza et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe prolonged fasting intervention implemented in our study provides a model through which to understand restrictive eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa (AN), a condition associated with severe, chronic starvation. AN is associated with dysfunction of appetite\u2010regulating brain areas (Lloyd & Steinglass,\u00a0 ), including hypoactivation of these areas (e.g., insula, OFC, and hypothalamus) in response to high\u2010calorie foods after a 12\u2010hr overnight fast (Holsen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) and hyperactivation of the DLPFC in response to high\u2010calorie food images (Brooks et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Altered reward and interoceptive processing of hedonic food cues (e.g., palatable food images and tastes of sucrose) as seen in fMRI studies and following a 12\u201316\u00a0hr fast also exists in women who remitted from AN, thus eliminating a confounding factor of malnutrition on food motivation neurocircuitry response and supporting pathological inherent mechanisms facilitating extended periods of food avoidance (Holsen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Kaye et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Our subjects demonstrated clear hyperactivation of homeostatic and food motivation brain areas as well as hypoactivation of the DLPFC following 10\u2010day fasting, which we speculate could provide a neural signature of the state of acute starvation in otherwise healthy adults. Since most fMRI studies designed to learn about differences in food\u2010cue processing between AN patients and healthy controls were conducted following a short\u2010term fast, our study adds to the literature by providing greater resemblance to the prolonged starvation associated with weight loss seen in AN. Additional studies are needed to further delineate the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of chronic starvation observed in AN. Our study design may also provide important information regarding neurobiological features of food processing in atypical anorexia nervosa (AAN), a relatively new diagnosis introduced in the DSM\u20105 (APA,\u00a0 ). Patients with AAN have similar features to patients with AN (e.g., significant food restriction and intense fear of weight gain), however, they are not underweight; rather, they have BMIs in the normal to overweight/obesity range (Matthews et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Moskowitz & Weiselberg,\u00a0 ). fMRI studies examining food cues processing in patients with AAN are lacking. Future studies comparing fMRI responses to food cues in patients with AAN compared to BMI\u2010matched controls could provide important knowledge regarding perturbation in the neurocircuitry of eating behavior in AAN. Finally, it is also important to note that prolonged fasting (greater than ~14\u00a0hr), is associated with significant cellular, metabolic and endocrine adaptions that could potentially affect appetite and subsequently fMRI activation in response to visual food stimuli. Prolonged fasting is associated with a \u201cmetabolic switch,\u201d transitioning from using glucose and carbohydrates as fuel sources for both body and brain to fatty acids and ketones (Mattson et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). It is also associated with marked changes in appetite\u2010regulating hormones such as leptin, insulin, ghrelin, and cortisol (Freire & Alvarez\u2010Leite,\u00a0 ; Rajpal & Ismail\u2010Beigi,\u00a0 ; Steinhauser et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). Future studies comprehensively evaluating both neural activation to food stimuli together with neuroendocrine adaptation to prolonged fasting will be important to conduct. \n\nOur findings are limited by the small sample size, although the significant effects observed following the diet interventions suggest adequate power for the statistical analysis approach implemented in this pilot study. Additionally, to avoid the potential harmful consequences of the fasting intervention, participants recruited to this study were on average slightly overweight (101%\u2013120% of ideal body weight). Since chronic obesity is associated with altered fMRI brain activation in response to high\u2010calorie food images (Devoto et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), the mild excess weight of the participants could have affected the results seen in our investigation. Another limitation relates to the known gender differences in visual processing of food images in hunger and satiety (Chao et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ) that we could not capture in our small sample. It is also important to note that three of the total number of subjects who participated in this study performed both fMRI evaluations (pre\u2010 and post\u2010overfeeding and fasting), and we cannot exclude a confounding effect of the familiarity with the visual stimuli presented during the fMRI task. Finally, the brain activation observed following fasting in this study could have been impacted by the prior high\u2010calorie diet intervention which all subjects received due to the study design. Future similar studies could include a randomized, crossover study design to minimize the potential confounding effect of participating in the two diet interventions in the same order (overfeeding followed by fasting). \n\nIn summary, our preliminary, novel findings demonstrate that 10\u00a0days of extreme diet intervention modulate brain activation in regions related to homeostasis, reward, interoception, and inhibitory control in a nutritional status\u2010dependent manner. A comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of the neurophysiology underlying states of hunger and satiety in healthy individuals could support research of disordered eating. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nNone. \n\n\n## DISCLOSURE \n  \nDr. Lawson has served on the scientific advisory board and has a financial interest in OXT Therapeutics, a company developing an intranasal oxytocin and long\u2010acting analogs of oxytocin to treat obesity and metabolic disease.

Functional connectivity was measured in the resting-state via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 53 patients with social anxiety disorder and 33 healthy control participants underwent a 6-minute resting-state fMRI scan. Functional connectivity of the reward system was analyzed by calculating whole-brain temporal correlations with a bilateral nucleus accumbens seed and a ventromedial prefrontal cortex seed. Patients with social anxiety disorder, relative to the control group, had (1) decreased functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens seed and other regions associated with reward, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex; (2) decreased functional connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex seed and lateral prefrontal regions, including the anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices; and (3) increased functional connectivity between both the nucleus accumbens seed and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex seed with more posterior brain regions, including anterior cingulate cortex. Social anxiety disorder appears to be associated with widespread differences in the functional connectivity of the reward system, including markedly decreased functional connectivity between reward regions and between reward regions and lateral prefrontal cortices, and markedly increased functional connectivity between reward regions and posterior brain regions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nA fundamental goal of neuroscience is to understand the functional organization of brain networks that underlie neuropsychiatric disease. One prevalent disease is social anxiety disorder (SAD) [ ], a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by fear of negative evaluation by others, which in turn leads to high levels of anxiety and avoidance of social situations [ ]. Multiple neuroimaging studies have focused on an increased amygdala response that is associated with social anxiety [ ]. Here we asked whether there are also differences in SAD of the intrinsic functional organization of the reward system of the brain, i.e. brain regions that are activated by the anticipation or receipt of reward [ ,  ]. We measured intrinsic functional organization from resting-state fMRI that identifies neural networks as defined by regions exhibiting correlated, low-frequency fMRI signals in the absence of external stimuli [ ,  ]. \n\nAnimal and human research have converged to identify several brain regions that are consistently activated by reward, including the striatum, nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and ventromedial prefrontal cortical (vmPFC)/medial orbitofrontal (mOFC). The ventral striatum and NAcc are associated with reward anticipation [ ,  ], whereas the vmPFC is associated with receipt of reward [ ]. The vmPFC has also been shown to encode the value of reward outcomes in decision-making that requires action [ ]. The vmPFC/mOFC likely plays a role in translating rewards to a representation of value [ ]. We were guided by this literature to select seeds (brain locations) in the NAcc and vmPFC regions, and compare their intrinsic functional connectivity between the SAD and control groups. \n\nNeuroimaging studies examining task-driven activations have indicated that the reward system is affected in SAD. People with SAD showed increased activation in the amygdala but decreased activation in OFC and vmPFC when anticipating negative emotional stimuli [ ]. SAD patients also showed increased temporal correlations between the amygdala and vmPFC/mOFC compared to healthy participants in resting-state functional connectivity [ ]. Striatal dysfunction also occurs in people with behavioral inhibition, a temperamental trait that is characterized by withdrawal from unfamiliar social situations and that might be a precursor of adult SAD [ \u2013 ]. Behaviorally inhibited adolescents have shown altered striatal activation, including in the caudate and NAcc, to anticipated rewards and altered vmPFC activation for reward outcomes [ ,  ]. Deep-brain stimulation of the NAcc was shown to decrease generalized anxiety, showing a causal role for the NAcc in anxiety [ ]. These results point to differences in the reward system between people who are socially anxious or behaviorally inhibited and those who are not. \n\nConceptually, it is plausible that SAD is associated with an altered reward circuitry. People typically find social interactions to be rewarding, but SAD patients often find such interactions to be aversive and anxiety provoking. Intrinsic functional connectivity may reflect chronic interactions among brain regions that mold large-scale functional networks. Reduced experience of social reward in SAD may be reflected by altered functional connectivity between the two major components of the reward system, which are also associated with social reward [ ], the NAcc and the vmPFC. Translation of reward into reward value may involve interactions between NAcc and vmPFC, and decreased NAcc-vmPFC connectivity may reflect weakened translation of reward into reward value. We hypothesized that people with SAD would show decreased functional connectivity between the NAcc and the vmPFC. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nPatients were recruited from the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders at Boston University and the Center for Anxiety and Traumatic Stress Related Disorders at Massachusetts General Hospital. Control participants were recruited via advertisements from the community. Brain scans were performed at the Athinoula A. Martinos Imaging Center at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT. All participants gave written informed consent to all procedures. The procedures were approved by the Committee on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects at MIT, the Institutional Review Board at Boston University, and the Partners Human Research Committee at Massachusetts General Hospital. \n\nParticipants were 53 outpatients with SAD (generalized subtype; years with SAD:   M   = 16.8 years; age of onset:   M   = 13.4 years; age:   M   = 29.9 years; 44 right handed; 17 women) and 33 healthy Control participants (age:   M   = 29.4 years; 29 right handed; 14 women). The two groups did not differ significantly for mean age (Control:   M   = 29.4,   SD   = 6.22; SAD:   M   = 29.9,   SD   = 8.25;   t  (84) = .31,   p   = .76), the proportions of men and women, (\u03c7 (1, N = 86) = .94,   p   = .33), or the proportions of right-handed and left-handed individuals (\u03c7 (1, N = 86) = .37,   p   = .54). Patient and Control groups did not differ significantly on IQ as estimated with the American National Adult Reading Test Full Scale Intelligence Quotient [ ] (Control:   M   = 118.6,   SD   = 7.22; SAD:   M   = 117.3,   SD   = 6.63,   t  (84) = 87,   p   = .39). \n\nPatients were off concurrent psychotropic medication for at least two weeks prior to the scanning session. Diagnoses were confirmed with Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV or the Anxiety Interview Schedule for DSM-IV [ ]. The diagnosis and diagnostic subtype specifier was assessed with the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule IV Revised (ADIS-IV-R) by experienced clinicians. The severity of social anxiety was measured using the clinician-administered version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) [ ] with a minimum LSAS score of 60 as an additional inclusion criterion (  M   = 81.85; range: 60\u2013121). \n\nExclusion from the study occurred in the case of a lifetime history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, psychosis, delusional disorders or obsessive-compulsive disorder; an eating disorder in the past 6 months; a history of substance or alcohol abuse or dependence (other than nicotine) in the last 6 months and posttraumatic stress disorder within the past 6 months. Entry of patients with other mood or anxiety disorders was permitted if SAD was judged to be the predominant disorder. In addition to the primary diagnosis of SAD, 18 participants also met diagnostic criteria for comorbid major depression disorder and 16 participants for comorbid anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder: n = 12; post traumatic stress disorder: n = 1; specific phobia: n = 7; panic disorder: 3). Both SAD and Control participants were excluded in the case of neurological disorders or serious medical illness. \n\nNo clinically relevant conditions in the Control group were permitted and the absence of these was confirmed prior to study inclusion using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV [ ]. Patients scored significantly worse on both the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI) [ ] (Control:   M   = 36.7,   SD   = 23.76); SAD:   M   = 112.6,   SD   = 22.27),   t  (84) = 14.99,   p   < .0001, two-tailed) and the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [ ] (Control:   M   = 30.0,   SD   = 7.01; SAD:   M   = 54.8,   SD   = 10.51,   t  (83) = 11.97,   p   < .0001, two-tailed). One SAD patient was missing the STAI score and was not included in this t-test. \n\n\n### Imaging \n  \n#### Acquisition \n  \nData were acquired using a 3-Tesla Siemens Tim Trio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel phased array whole-head coil. 3D T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) anatomical images (TR = 2530 ms, TE = 3.39 ms, flip angle = 9\u00b0, 1 mm slice thickness, 1 mm  in plane resolution) and one 6-minute resting state scan were collected while participants fixated on a cross (T2* weighted gradient echo TR/TE/Flip = 6000ms/30ms/90\u00b0, 67 contiguous interleaved oblique slices, voxel size: 2 X 2 X 2). The sequence included prospective acquisition correction (PACE) for head motion [ ]. \n\n\n\n### Data Analysis \n  \n#### fMRI Analysis \n  \nThe functional data were analyzed using SPM8 [ ]. Functional images were preprocessed with realignment for motion correction, slice-time correction, artifact detection and spatial smoothing (8mm full-width-half-maximum Gaussian kernel). To address any spurious correlations in resting-state networks caused by head motion, we used the Artifact Detection Tools (ART,  ) to identify problematic time points during the scan. Specifically, an image was defined as an artifactual time point if the head displacement in X, Y, or Z direction was greater than .5 mm from the previous frame, or if the global mean intensity in the image was greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean image intensity for the entire resting scan. A two-sample t-test was performed using the number of artifactual time points to compare the difference in motion between the Control group and the SAD group. \n\nCompCor was used to estimate physiological and other sources of noise [ ]. Global signal regression was not used because it has been shown to bias and produce spurious negative correlations [ ,  ]. Anatomical volumes were segmented into grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) areas and the resulting masks were eroded (one voxel erosion) to minimize partial volume effects. The temporal time series characterizing the estimated subject motion (3 rotation and 3 translation parameters, plus another 6 parameters representing their first-order temporal derivatives) and artifactual covariates (one covariate per artifactual time point consisting of 0\u2019s everywhere and a \u201c1\u201d for the artifactual time point), as well as the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time series within the subject-specific white matter mask (3 first principal components) and CSF mask (3 first principal components), were used as temporal covariates and removed from the BOLD functional data using linear regression, and the resulting residual BOLD time series were band-pass filtered (0.008Hz < f < 0.083Hz). \n\nNAcc and vmPFC were   a priori   regions of interest (ROI) to be used as seeds in the functional connectivity analysis. The seeds were selected from prior reward activation studies (and thus independent of group differences in the present study). In order to minimize the number of statistical comparison, the NAcc (left and right NAcc) and vmPFC seeds (three locations) respectively, were combined into two analyses. Two 5mm-radius ROIs, one on the left and one on the right, from the center of activation in the NAcc regions (MNI: (-8,12,1), (11,11,1);  ) were selected from areas that showed increased activation to reward anticipation from Knutson   et al  . [ ]. Three 10mm-radius ROIs from the center of activation in the vmPFC (MNI: (-6,24,-21), (6,30,-9), (9,27,-12)) were selected from areas that showed increased activation to reward value from Gl\u00e4scher   et al  . [ ]. The NAcc seeds were smaller in volume because the NAcc is considerably smaller in volume than the vmPFC. \n   Nucleus Accumbens Seed.  \nBilateral nucleus accumbens seed used in resting-state functional connectivity analysis. MNI coordinates: (-8,12,1), (11,11,1). \n  \nThe left and right NAcc ROIs both showed increased activation to reward anticipation simultaneously in the same study [ ] and therefore were combined to create one NAcc seed (  and   Figs for analysis of separate ROIs). Similarly, the three vmPFC ROIs showed activation to reward value simultaneously in the same study [ ] and therefore were combined to create one vmPFC seed (  and   Figs for analysis of separate ROIs). Consistent with activation literature, both the individual NAcc locations and the individual vmPFC locations exhibited similar patterns of functional connectivity and similar alterations in the SAD group, which supported the validity of combining the individual locations into two seeds. \n\nFirst-level correlation maps were produced by extracting the mean BOLD time course from each seed and computing Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between that time course and the time course of all other voxels. Correlation coefficients were converted to normally distributed Z-scores using the Fisher transformation to allow for second-level General Linear Model analysis. Two sample t-tests were performed on the Fisher transformed r-maps to examine the differences in resting state functional connectivity between Control and Patient groups. One set of t-tests examined differences for the bilateral NAcc seeds combined into a single network, and the other set of t-tests examined differences for the three vmPFC seeds combined into a single network. All results were reported using a cluster-wise false discovery rate (Cluster-wise FDR corrected) threshold of .05 for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed in the volume and the results were projected to an inflated cortical surface for visualization. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nTo ensure that results were not due to motion artifacts, we compared the number of artifactual time points in the SAD and Control groups. There was no significant difference between groups in the number of artifactual time points (p = .35). \n\n### Nucleus Accumbens Seed \n  \n#### Contrast: Control group > SAD group \n  \nThe SAD group exhibited significant and widespread decreases in functional correlations (connectivity), compared to the Control group, between the NAcc seed ( ) and multiple regions associated with reward, value, and decision-making, including vmPFC/BA11, bilateral medial anterior prefrontal cortex/BA10, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, anterior regions of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), subgenual ACC, left temporal pole, left hippocampus, and bilateral putamen (Figs   &  ;  ). The region of maximal difference was a cluster that included the vmPFC, and in this cluster the Control group exhibited a significantly positive correlation, but the SAD group did not exhibit any significant correlation (Figs  ,   &  ). \n   Nucleus Accumbens Seed Functional Connectivity Network of Control > SAD.  \nResting-state connectivity for   (A)   Control group,   (B)   SAD group, and   (C)   Control group > SAD group with bilateral nucleus accumbens seed from   (Cluster-wise FDR corrected, p < .05; Peak voxel: (MNI Coordinates) (30, 12, -6; p = .001).

Error bars represent standard errors. \n     Regions of Significant Differences in Functional Connectivity Between SAD and Control Groups.        \nTo ensure that group differences were not the result of lower signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the vmPFC/mOFC cortex in the SAD group, we calculated the temporal SNR separately for the vmPFC cluster for each group. The SAD group had a higher temporal SNR in the vmPFC cluster (Control:   M   = 141.95,   SD   = 32.85; SAD:   M   = 160.81,   SD   = 46.73;   p   < .046, two-tailed). Therefore, increased functional connectivity in the Control group compared to the SAD group was not due to loss of signal in the SAD group. \n\n\n#### Contrast: SAD group > Control group \n  \nThe SAD group exhibited significant increases in connectivity, compared to the Control group, between the NAcc seed and more posterior regions including bilateral somatosensory association cortex, bilateral premotor cortex, bilateral primary motor cortex, and posterior ventral ACC (vACC) ( ;  ). The group differences reflected a pattern of negative correlations (anticorrelations) between the NAcc seed and these posterior regions in the Control group versus a pattern of positive correlations between the NAcc seed and these regions in the SAD group ( ). \n   Nucleus Accumbens Seed Functional Connectivity Network of SAD > Control and Z-Scores.  \n (A)   Resting-state connectivity for SAD group > Control group with bilateral nucleus accumbens seed from   (Cluster-wise FDR corrected, p < .05; Peak voxel: (MNI Coordinates) (0, -34, 64; p = .006).

Both groups exhibited positive correlations between the vmPFC seed and the other regions, but the correlations were significantly greater in the Control group. The region of maximal difference included the NAcc and regions associated with cognitive control, the lateral PFC. In this cluster, both the Control and SAD groups exhibited significantly positive correlations (Figs  ,  , &  ). \n   Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex Seed Functional Connectivity Network.  \n (A)   Ventromedial prefrontal cortex seed used in resting-state functional connectivity analysis.

The group differences reflected a pattern of negative correlations (anticorrelations) between the vmPFC seeds and these regions (all three clusters) in the Control group versus a pattern of either positive correlation in the SAD group (cluster 1 and 2, including posterior vACC; Fig   &  ) or the absence of significant correlation in the SAD group (cluster 3;  ).

Positive temporal correlations between two major components of the reward system, the NAcc and the ventral region of the vmPFC, were significantly reduced in the SAD group. Functional connectivity between both the NAcc and the vmPFC seed regions with multiple other anterior brain regions were significantly reduced in SAD, including prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions associated with decision-making. Conversely, the SAD group showed significantly increased functional connectivity between both the NAcc and the vmPFC seed regions with multiple posterior brain regions, including posterior ACC and posterior parietal association cortex. In these posterior regions, the Control group exhibited significant negative correlations (anticorrelations) with NAcc and vmPFC, whereas the SAD group exhibited either a reversal with a positive correlation or the absence of a correlation. Thus, the SAD group exhibited markedly decreased functional connectivity both between reward regions and also between reward regions and lateral prefrontal cortex, and markedly increased functional connectivity between reward regions and more posterior brain regions. \n\nThe SAD group showed greatly reduced functional connectivity within major components of the reward system, namely the NAcc and the vmPFC. The NAcc is associated with reward anticipation [ , ] and the vmPFC is associated with encoding the value of reward [ ]. If social interaction is typically a source of substantial reward, then the absence of such reward due to chronic fear and anxiety about social interaction in SAD may diminish the frequency of interactions among these components of the reward system. Alternatively, this reduced functional connectivity among these components of the reward system may result in people with SAD seeking less social interaction. The core reward system was also significantly less correlated in the SAD group with other brain regions implicated in decision-making and cognitive control that often interact with reward regions. These regions included bilateral DLPFC, bilateral lateral anterior prefrontal cortex/BA10, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, and anterior regions of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and subgenual ACC. \n\nWhereas functional connectivity was decreased within the reward system and between the reward system and anterior brain regions, functional connectivity was increased in the SAD group between the reward regions and multiple posterior brain regions. There were also contrasting patterns in the group differences in anterior and posterior regions. In anterior regions, the SAD group exhibited positive correlations between reward regions, but these correlations were significantly less than in the Control group. In posterior regions, the Control group exhibited negative correlations with reward regions, whereas the SAD group exhibited either a positive correlation or the absence of a correlation; in both cases the SAD group exhibited significantly greater correlations relative to the Control group. \n\nMore specifically, the SAD group exhibited a positive correlation (and not the negative correlation of the Control group), between both the NAcc and the vmPFC and posterior regions including the posterior regions of the ACC and posterior parietal cortex. The findings in the Control group were consistent with a previous report of anticorrelated networks between the posterior ACC and both the striatum and vmPFC [ ]. Posterior ACC has been shown to be involved in reward-related decisions, becoming more activated as punishment increased [ ] or during decisions that involve minimizing punishment [ ]. The hyperconnectivity and lack of anticorrelations between reward regions and posterior ACC may reflect changes in the network due to the experience of avoiding social punishment and evaluation. Again, an alternative is that this hyperconnectivity may result in seeking less social interaction to avoid social punishment and evaluation. This, together with the decreased connectivity between the NAcc and vmPFC, may reflect an altered reward network in which reward prediction regions are less correlated with value encoding regions, and both of these reward regions are more correlated with regions that involve punishment. This may help explain how altered brain networks contribute to socially avoidant behavior in people with SAD. \n\nPrevious neuroimaging studies in SAD have found reduced structural connectivity (white-matter organization) and resting-state functional connectivity between subcortical regions and orbitofrontal cortex [ \u2013 ]. The reduced relations between prefrontal and subcortical regions, such as the amygdala, could reflect decreased prefrontal regulation of subcortical regions [ ]. The present findings of reduced functional connectivity between prefrontal and subcortical reward-related regions also suggest reduced regulation of social reward. \n\nThere are both psychological and technical limitations of the present study. For the SAD group, the social interactions with researchers involved in performing the imaging may have influenced the nature of thought processes reflected in the connectivity measures. Also, there were no significant correlations between measures of SAD severity (LSAS, SPAI, STAI) and functional connectivity measures. Future research could explore the relation of reduced functional connectivity between the NAcc and vmPFC in SAD patients with tasks that involve social reward. A technical limitation of the study is that we acquired data with a relatively long time of repetition (TR = 6 seconds). We used the 6 second TR in order to achieve high spatial resolution with whole-brain coverage because previous research has demonstrated that array coils provide the biggest increases in temporal SNR at high spatial resolutions [ ]. Although this TR is unusually long, there is evidence that there are no significant differences in the correlation strengths between the resting state networks when comparing TRs of 2.5 s and 5 s [ ]. Furthermore, the correlations observed in the Control group were similar to prior studies using more conventional shorter TRs [ ,  ]. \n\nWe investigated the intrinsic functional connectivity of the human reward system in people with social anxiety disorder. People with SAD had decreased functional connectivity between the NAcc seed, which encodes reward anticipation, and the vmPFC, which encodes reward value. People with SAD also had decreased functional connectivity between the vmPFC seed and the lateral anterior prefrontal cortex and the DLPFC, which are associated with decision making. The SAD group also did not have the typical anticorrelations between both the NAcc seed and the vmPFC seed with the posterior ACC, a region that is associated with punishment [ ]. The observation that independent analyses of NAcc and vmPFC seeds yielded similar differences in connectivity between the SAD and Control groups suggests that there is a widespread difference in reward-network functional connectivity in SAD, spanning regions involved in both reward anticipation and reward receipt and valuation. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone.0125286.t001\n### Label: Table 1\nRegions for Resting State-Connectivity Clusters\tRegions for Resting State-Connectivity Clusters\tRegions for Resting State-Connectivity Clusters\tRegions for Resting State-Connectivity Clusters\tRegions for Resting State-Connectivity Clusters\tRegions for Resting State-Connectivity Clusters\tRegions for Resting State-Connectivity Clusters\tRegions for Resting State-Connectivity Clusters\nSeed\tContrast\tMNI (X, Y, Z) Coordinates for Peak Voxel\tMNI (X, Y, Z) Coordinates for Peak Voxel.1\tMNI (X, Y, Z) Coordinates for Peak Voxel.2\tRegion\tKE\tp\nNAcc\tControl > SAD\t30\t12\t-6\tR.

Previous studies have revealed that mutual cooperation was reliably correlated with two reward-related brain regions, the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study sought to investigate how the loss and gain contexts modulated the neural responses to mutual cooperation. Twenty-five female participants were scanned when they played a series of one-shot prisoner\u2019s dilemma games in the loss and gain contexts. Specifically, participants and partners independently chose to either cooperate with each other or not, and each was awarded or deprived of (in the gain context or the loss context, respectively) a sum of money which depended upon the interaction of their choices. Behavioral results indicated that participants cooperated in nearly half of the experiment trials and reported higher level of positive emotions for mutual cooperation in both contexts, but they cooperated more in the gain than in the loss context. At the neural level, stronger activities in the orbitofrontal cortex were observed for mutual cooperation compared with the other three outcomes in both contexts, while stronger activation in ventral striatum associated with mutual cooperation was observed in the gain context only. Together, our data indicated that, even in the one-shot interaction under loss context, participants still exhibited preference for cooperation and the rewarding experience from a mutually cooperative social interaction activated the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex, but the loss context weakened the association between the ventral striatum activation and mutual cooperation. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTraditional economic theories generally assume that people are absolutely self-interested. However, hundreds of recent experimental evidences have indicated that, in social interactions, people often showed concerns for interests of others and exhibited strong preferences for fairness and reciprocity, eventually leading to regular deviations from purely self-interested behaviors [ \u2013 ]. A good example is the pervasive cooperation among nonrelatives, which is an important base of human society, especially when the social division of labor is striding towards intensification and specialization. \n\nCooperative behavior among nonrelatives has been widely explored in behavioral and neuroimaging studies using Prisoners\u2019 Dilemma (PD) game. In this game, two players simultaneously decide whether or not to cooperate with each other and receive a payoff that depends upon the interaction of their respective choices. Mutual cooperation leads to a modest payoff to both players, while a lesser amount of payoff to both players would occur in case of mutual defection. Importantly, a player gets largest payoff when he defects and the partner cooperates, and the worst outcome is got when the player cooperates while the partner defects. According to traditional economic theories, for maximizing personal benefits, the player should always defect. However, abundant studies have found that players cooperated more than expected, with mutual cooperation occurring about 50% [ ]. Even when the interaction was anonymous and one-shot, which mean there were no monetary return and gain for reputation in the future, a considerable percentage of people still tend to cooperate [ ]. How did people resist the temptation of monetary rewards and choose to cooperate with nonrelatives in the PD game? To answer this question, a large number of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have been conducted using the PD game or related trust games. It was revealed that mutual cooperation was reliably correlated with two reward-related brain regions, the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex [ \u2013 ]. Moreover, the degree of future cooperation could be predicted by the activation in the ventral striatum [ ,  ]. Therefore, based on these findings, some researchers speculated that cooperation, as a type of social reward represented in the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex, is inherently rewarding and has higher subjective value than monetary rewards gained from defection [ ]. \n\nHowever, previous neuroimaging studies were usually conducted with repeated PD game, which leaving open the possibility that activations in reward regions were the result of that participants anticipated getting more money from the cooperation partnership in the future. In addition, most of previous studies using the PD game were conducted in gain context, i.e. players were awarded a sum of money depended upon the interaction of their choices. But, in real world, there also exist many situations in which people had to share a certain amount of loss, such as the failure of co-investments. It remains unclear whether people still endow higher subjective value to mutual cooperation than monetary rewards gained from defection when the conflict between personal and others\u2019 interests concentrates on negative outcomes. \n\nTo shed light on these questions, in the present fMRI study, we adopted a variant of the one-shot PD game in which loss context was employed. Specifically, participants and partners independently chose to either cooperate with each other or not, and each was awarded or deprived of (in the gain context or the loss context, respectively) a sum of money that depended upon the interaction of their choices. Following a conventional approach to study context effect on decision making, participants in the current study were initially endowed with 100 RMB as basic payment and the losses incurred were subtracted from this initial endowment. In the version of the game we used here, it was played a single time with each other. Firstly, we aimed to explored whether mutual cooperation was still associated with activations of brain regions involved in reward processing in the one-shot and anonymous interaction, in which there were no long-term benefits being expected from a cooperation partnership. Secondly, we sought to investigate the mechanism underlying the modulation of responses to cooperation in the PD game by context (loss vs. gain). Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that, even in the one-shot and anonymous interaction, activations in brain region implicated reward processing (i.e. ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex) still existed for mutual cooperation, but the activation strength might be different between the gain and the loss context. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-five right-handed female volunteers from the university community with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated in this experiment. For imaging data analyses, three participants were excluded from further statistical analysis because of lack of cooperated trials or defected trials in at least one condition. One of them did not cooperate at all. One of them did not give cooperation responses in the gain context and the last one did not give defection responses in the gain context. In addition, the other four participants had to be excluded due to excessive head movements, finally leaving 18 subjects for imaging data analyses [mean age = 21.04 \u00b1 1.59 (SD) years]. None of the participants reported a significant abnormal neurological history. All the participants gave written informed consent before scanning and were paid according to outcomes from a random selection of 20% trials plus a 100 RMB bonus. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of East China Normal University. \n\n\n### Materials \n  \nEighty female face pictures with neutral expression were selected from the Chinese Facial Affective Picture System[ ] with consent for publication, and randomly allocated to 2 (context: loss vs. gain) \u00d7 2 (type of partner: cooperated vs. defected) conditions. The arousal and attractiveness of pictures were counterbalanced across different conditions. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nBefore scanning, participants were told the rules of the game and that they would play with 80 different strange female partners who are students from another university in Shanghai. They were also informed that, for practical reasons, not all 80 game partners could actually be present in the fMRI laboratory, but that partners\u2019 choices had been collected before the experiment. In addition, participants were told that both she and the partner in each trial would be paid according to the interaction of their choices. They would be given a basic payment for their participation (100 RMB) plus or minus the amount of money obtained or lost from a random selection of 20% trials in the game. In reality, each subject was the only participant in the experiment, and putative partners\u2019 choices were determined in advance, so that half of partners cooperated and the other half defected in each context. \n\nThe participants then completed 80 trials in the scanner with 40 trials in each context ( ). Each trial began with a 1.5s presentation of the partner's face. During the next 8s epoch, participants chose to cooperate or defect by pressing one of two buttons on a button box, and their choices were showed in red. After that, the trial outcome was displayed for 6s. All the trials were presented in a random order. Each trial was jittered with inter-stimulus intervals from 2 to 5 s, during which a black fixation cross was presented. Two additional jittered blanks (750\u223c2000ms; 1500\u223c2500ms) were set between the presentation of the partner\u2019s face and the decision phase and, between the wait phase and the outcome phase. \n   Experimental procedure.  \nParticipants were scanned while playing the game for 80 trials, 40 in each context. Participant\u2019s choices (C or D) are listed atop columns and partner\u2019s choices (C or D) are listed aside rows. Money amounts in bold are for participant. Amounts in parentheses are for partner. \n  \nAfter scanning, participants were asked to rate their emotional reactions to four PD game outcomes (CC: player and partner both cooperated; CD: player cooperated and partner defected; DC: player defected and partner cooperated; DD: player and partner both defected) in each context. Nine point Likert scales were used to rate the following emotions/feelings: happiness, trust, anger, disappointment, shame, and guilt. \n\n\n### fMRI Image Acquisition and Analysis \n  \nScanning was carried out on a 3T Siemens scanner at the Functional MRI Lab (East China Normal University, Shanghai). For functional images, 36 slices were acquired using a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR = 2200 ms, TE = 30 ms, FOV = 220 mm, matrix size = 64 \u00d7 64, slice thickness = 3 mm, gap = 0.3 mm). Before the functional run, a high-resolution structural image was acquired using a T1-weighted, multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) sequence (TR = 1900 ms, TE = 3.42 ms, 192 slices, slice thickness = 1 mm, FOV = 256 mm, matrix size = 256 \u00d7 256). \n\nData pre-processing and statistical analyses were performed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London). The functional images were corrected for the delay in slice acquisition and were realigned to the first image to correct for interscan head movements. The individual T1-weighted, 3D structural image was co-registered to the mean EPI image generated after realignment. The co-registered structural image was then segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using a unified segmentation algorithm[ ].The functional images after slice timing and realignment procedures were spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (resampled at 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm ) using the normalization parameters estimated during unified segmentation and then spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM). \n\nA general linear model (GLM) was defined for each participant that examined the neural response to the period in which outcome was revealed. More specially, at the first level, eight types of events were defined according to context (Loss vs. Gain) and the PD game outcome (CC, CD, DC, and DD). They were convolved using a canonical hemodynamic response function. All the encoding trials were modeled from the onset time of the outcomes (with zero duration). Additional regressors of no interest were created for partner presentation, decision and wait. Six regressors modeling movement-related variance and one modeling the overall mean were also employed in the design matrix. A general linear model analysis created eight contrast images for each participant summarizing differences of interest. The eight first level contrast images from each participant were then analyzed at the second level employing a random-effects model (flexible factorial design in SPM8). \n\nWe performed region of interest (ROI) analyses on the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex which involved in reward processing. These two ROIs were defined as 10 mm-radius sphere centered on the activation peak for the contrast between mutual cooperation and the average of the other three PD game outcomes reported in Rilling et al.[ ,  ,  ], after converting from Talairach to MNI coordinates. Parameter estimates were extracted from each ROI for each of the eight experimental conditions from each participant using MarsBaR and then entered into ANOVA. \n\nThis ROI analysis was supplemented with a whole brain analysis in which brain activities related to mutual cooperation were defined by contrasting the BOLD response to the CC outcome with the average response of the other three outcomes combined[ ,  ,  ]. Brain activations corresponding to gain relative to loss trials were identified by the (Gain\u2014Loss) and reverse contrasts. Then, the context \u00d7 cooperation interactions defined by (CC\u2014Average of the other three outcomes) \u2014(CC\u2014Average of the other three outcomes)  were computed to explore how context affect cooperation. Areas of activations were identified as significant only if they passed the threshold of   p   < 0.05 family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster-level with an underlying voxel-level of   p   < 0.001 (uncorrected). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nFirst of all, we examined participants\u2019 strategy during the task to make sure that their responses in the PD game were not just randomly decided. It turned out that participants did not adopt a Win-Stay/Lose-Shift strategy or Tit-for-Tat-like strategies. Instead, our data revealed participants\u2019 decision were influenced by their own choices in the preceding trial. Specially, Paired-sample t test showed that participants cooperated more after defecting (  M   = 0.45) than cooperating (  M   = 0.35;   t  (24) = -3.47,   p   = 0.002) in the preceding trial. \n\nPaired-sample t test and \u03c7  test revealed a greater cooperation rates when participants played the PD game in the gain context (  M   = 0.46,   SD   = 0.27) than in the loss context (  M   = 0.34,   SD   = 0.17) (  t  (24) = 3.27,   p =   0.003; \u03c7  = 32.06, P < 0.001). \n\nA 2 (context: loss vs. gain) \u00d7 4 (outcome: CC, CD, DC, and DD) repeated measures ANOVA was carried out for each emotion rating ( ). Specially, for ratings of happiness, there were significant main effects of context (  F  (1,24) = 9.79,   p =   0.005) and outcome (  F  (3,72) = 67.23,   p <   0.001). Post hoc analyses showed that the level of happiness was higher for CC outcome than the other three outcomes (  ps <   0.001) and higher in the gain than the loss context (  p =   0.005). For ratings of trust, there were significant main effects of outcome (  F  (3,72) = 54.89,   p <   0.001), post hoc analyses showed that the level of trust was higher for CC outcome than the other three outcomes (  ps <   0.001). For ratings of anger and disappointment, there were significant main effects of context(anger:   F  (1,24) = 5.87,   p =   0.023; disappointment:   F  (1,24) = 5.07,   p =   0.034) and main effects of outcome (anger:   F  (3,72) = 74.14,   p <   0.001; disappointment:   F  (3,72) = 62.22,   p <   0.001), post hoc analyses showed that the level of anger and disappointment were higher for CD outcome than the other three outcomes (anger:   ps <   0.001; disappointment:   ps   < 0.001) and higher in the gain than the loss context (  p   = 0.023). For ratings of shame and guilt, there were significant main effects of outcome (shame:   F  (3,72) = 62.88,   p <   0.001; guilt:   F  (3,72) = 76.78,   p <   0.001), post hoc analyses showed that the level of shame and guilt were higher for DC outcome than the other three outcomes (shame:   ps <   0.001; guilt:   ps   < 0.001). \n   Emotion ratings for each outcome of the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game in the gain and the loss context.  \nC = cooperate; D = defect. \n  \n\n### fMRI results \n  \n#### ROI analyses \n  \nParameter estimates across the ventral striatum (MNI 4, 18, 0) and the orbitofrontal cortex (MNI 3, 46, -12) reported in Rilling et al. [ ,  ] were extracted. For the ventral striatum, a 2 (context: loss vs. gain) \u00d7 4 (outcome: CC, CD, DC, and DD) repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant main effects of context (  F  (1,17) = 4.57,   p =   0.047) and outcome (  F  (3,51) = 4.85,   p =   0.005), indicating greater activities in the gain than in the loss context and increased activities for CC outcome than the other three. A significant interaction was also found (  F  (3,51) = 4.61,   p =   0.006). We further examined the effect of outcome within each context. Post hoc analysis showed that activities is greater for CC outcome than the other three in the gain context (  ps < 0  .  01  ), whereas there was no significant difference between outcomes in the loss context ( ). \n   ROI analysis of the parameter estimates of the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex for eight experimental conditions.    \nFor the orbitofrontal cortex, similar ANOVA was carried out. The result showed the main effect of outcome (  F  (3,51) = 6.40,   p =   0.001), Post hoc analyses indicated greater activities for CC outcome than the other three (  ps <   0.05). There was no significant main effect of context or context-by-outcome interaction ( ). \n\n\n#### Whole-brain analyses \n  \nCompared with the other three outcomes, experiencing CC outcome activated left ventral striatum (MNI -6\u20138 22), left orbital frontal cortex (MNI -6 54\u20132), left anterior cingulate cortex (MNI -4 40\u20136), left dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MNI -12 58 16), left lingual gyrus (MNI -18\u201386\u201310), right calcarine gyrus (MNI 16\u201392 4), and bilateral superior temporal gyrus (MNI -40\u201338 16 and 70\u201326 6). The reverse contrast showed greater activities in right lingual gyrus (MNI 10\u201378 0) and left inferior parietal lobule (MNI -26\u201354 52) ( ). \n   Regions Showing Main Effects of Outcome.        \nData analyses revealed that dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MNI -12 58 16) and cuneus (MNI 16\u201380 28) survived by contrasting gain trials with loss trials, whereas no region was activated in the reverse contrast ( ). \n   Regions Showing Main Effects of Context.        \nInteraction between context and cooperation was computed by the (CC\u2014Average of the other three outcomes) \u2014(CC\u2014Average of the other three outcomes) . Results showed that bilateral ventral striatum (MNI -4 18 0 and 14 26\u20132) and inferior temporal gyrus (MNI -38\u201328\u201314) were activated ( ;  ), whereas no region was activated in the reverse contrast. \n  \n(A) Brain activities in Outcome \u00d7 Context interaction (  p   < 0.001, uncorrected). (B) Clusters in OFC overlapped between the simple effect of outcome in gain context and in loss context (  p   < 0.001, uncorrected). \n     Regions Showing Outcome \u00d7 Context Interactions.        \nTo further clarify whether there was a common neural mechanisms, we overlapped the simple effect of outcome in gain context (CC\u2014Average of the other three outcomes)  with the simple effect of outcome in loss context (CC\u2014Average of the other three outcomes) . The cluster located in the orbital frontal cortex overlapped between these two contrasts ( ). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe employed a modified version of the one-shot PD game to investigate how loss and gain context modulated brain responses to cooperation. Consistent with previous studies[ ,  ,  ,  ], even in this anonymous and one-shot PD game, participants still choose to cooperate in nearly half of the experiment trials, and they cooperated more in the gain than in the loss context. At the neural level, both the ROI and whole brain analysis revealed more activities in the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex for mutual cooperation relative to the other three outcomes. When focusing on modulation of cooperation response by context, we found that the ventral striatum only showed cooperation-specific activations in the gain context, but not in the loss context. And overlap analysis showed that cooperation-specific activations in the orbitofrontal cortex were not affected by context. \n\nPostscan emotion rating showed that mutual cooperation was the most personally satisfying outcome. Specifically, participants experienced high level positive emotions such as happiness and trust for CC outcome, while the most profitable DC outcome provoked negative feelings of shame and guilt. Previous studies using PD game had also revealed that the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex were activated more by mutual cooperation than by a same monetary reward in a nonsocial context[ ,  ]. Combined with the neuroimaging evidence linking the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex to processing the subjective value of fairness and cooperation[ ,  ,  ,  ,  ], our data suggest that increased activation levels in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex with the CC outcome may relate to the rewarding experience from a mutually cooperative social interaction. In addition, our results are also consistent with previous findings that reward-related neural activity was greater for positive reward prediction errors [ \u2013 ], or a discrepancy that an actual reward is superior to what is predicted. In the one-shot PD game, participants could never know for certain whether partner would cooperate or not, so the game outcomes were always of an unpredictable nature. Therefore, when participants chose to cooperate, compared with CD outcome, CC outcome involves a positive reward prediction error [ ,  ]. \n\nWe further studied the impact of context on participants' behavioral and neural responses to cooperation. It was revealed that participants cooperated more and experienced higher level of happiness for cooperation in the gain context than in the loss context. Parallel with this, cooperation-specific activations in the ventral striatum only existed in the gain context. Our findings were consisted with the evidence from a recent functional neuroimaging study [ ], in which the authors employed a modified version of the Ultimatum Game to investigate how brain differentially responds to fairness in loss and gain contexts. They found the association between activation in ventral striatum and fairness was weakened in the loss context. Except of being involved in processing the subjective value of fairness and cooperation [ ,  ,  ], the ventral striatum is also known for its vital contribution to the cerebral representation of the primary reinforcement and monetary reward [ \u2013 ]. Therefore, under the shadow of monetary loss, the activation of ventral striatum might be weakened. \n\nHowever, the orbitofrontal cortex was also activated more for mutual cooperation relative to the other three outcomes, and this cooperation-specific activation was not affected by context. Previous studies have identified the significant role of the orbitofrontal cortex in mediating the mental pleasure related to the secondary reinforcement with social implications [ ,  ]. For example, a recent study[ ] revealed that processing moral beauty is related to activations in the cortical reward region of the orbitofrontal cortex, whereas facial beauty involved both cortical and subcortical reward regions (the orbitofrontal cortex and the putamen). Based on previous and our findings, we speculated that, compared with the ventral striatum, the orbitofrontal cortex might be more sensitive to social reward involving moral implication. Taken together, the activation of the orbitofrontal cortex observed in our experiment might be involved in processing purer social reward of cooperation which was immune to the impact of loss context. \n\nDorsal medial prefrontal cortex and rostral anterior cingulate cortex activities were also found when identifying activations associated with mutual cooperation. Previous studies have revealed that the DMPFC was involved in the evaluation of self-referential stimuli and moral judgment [ \u2013 ]. The rACC with dense projections to orbitofrontal cortex and striatum is part of a wider network that mediates reinforcement and reward preference [ \u2013 ]. Thus, it is plausible that rACC activities in the present study might be related to the reinforcement of cooperation and DMPFC activities might be associated with moral evaluation of self. \n\nIn conclusion, the current study further illustrated that the context of loss and gain modulate people\u2019s behavioral and neural responses to social cooperation. Results showed that, at the behavioral level, the mutual cooperation was the most satisfying outcome for participants but they cooperated more in the gain context than the loss context. At the neural level, cooperation-specific activations in the ventral striatum only existed in the gain context, but activations in the orbitofrontal cortex were not affected by context. Together, our data indicated that, even in the one-shot interaction under loss context, participants still derive higher hedonic value from the mutual cooperation, but the loss context weakened the association between the ventral striatum activation and mutual cooperation. \n\nFuture studies might further examine the context effect on neural responses to social cooperation from two aspects. Firstly, given some previous studies reported men and women behaved differently in the PD game, future researches might explore gender differences in neural responses to social cooperation in both contexts. Secondly, following conventional approach, participants were initially endowed with a sum of money as basic payment in the current study. Thus, the loss context in the current study was defined by a relative loss frame. Future studies might evaluate the context effect on neural responses to social cooperation with absolute loss context. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone.0160503.t001\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tUnnamed: 1_level_0\tCoordinates\tCoordinates\tCoordinates\tUnnamed: 5_level_0\tUnnamed: 6_level_0\nBrain Region\tSide\tx\ty\tz\tt-value\tVoxels\nCC\u2014A\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDorsal Medial Prefrontal Cortex\tL\t-20.0\t42.0\t38.0\t8.44\t6265.0\nOrbital Frontal Cortex\tL\t-6.0\t54.0\t-2.0\t7.07\t\nAnterior Cingulate Cortex\tL\t-4.0\t40.0\t-6.0\t6.35\t\nLingual Gyrus\tL\t-18.0\t-86.0\t-10.0\t5.86\t725.0\nCalcarine Gyrus\tR\t16.0\t-92.0\t4.0\t5.64\t486.0\nSuperior Temporal Gyrus\tL\t-40.0\t-38.0\t16.0\t5.44\t1275.0\nSuperior Temporal Gyrus\tR\t70.0\t-26.0\t6.0\t4.75\t1014.0\nVentral Striatum\tL\t-6.0\t-8.0\t22.0\t4.04\t188.0\nA\u2014CC\t\t\t\t\t\t\nLingual Gyrus\tR\t10.0\t-78.0\t0.0\t6.36\t837.0\nInferior Parietal Lobule\tL\t-26.0\t-54.0\t52.0\t4.38\t271.0\n### Caption\nRegions Showing Main Effects of Outcome.\n### Footer\nNote.

However, the mechanisms underlying the CNS response to glucose have not been defined. We recently demonstrated that the slowing of gastric emptying by glucose is dependent on activation of the gut peptide cholecystokinin (CCK ) receptor. Using physiological functional magnetic resonance imaging this study aimed to determine the whole brain response to glucose, and whether CCK plays a central role. \n\n\n## Experimental design \n  \nChanges in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal were monitored using fMRI in 12 healthy subjects following intragastric infusion (250\u00a0ml) of: 1\u00a0M glucose\u00a0+\u00a0predosing with dexloxiglumide (CCK  receptor antagonist), 1\u00a0M glucose\u00a0+\u00a0placebo, or 0.9% saline (control)\u00a0+\u00a0placebo, in a single-blind, randomised fashion. Gallbladder volume, blood glucose, insulin, and GLP-1 and CCK concentrations were determined. Hunger, fullness and nausea scores were also recorded. \n\n\n## Principal observations \n  \nIntragastric glucose elevated plasma glucose, insulin, and GLP-1, and reduced gall bladder volume (an   in vivo   assay for CCK secretion). Glucose decreased BOLD signal, relative to saline, in the brainstem and hypothalamus as well as the cerebellum, right occipital cortex, putamen and thalamus. The timing of the BOLD signal decrease was negatively correlated with the rise in blood glucose and insulin levels. The glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex arm highlighted a CCK -receptor dependent increase in BOLD signal only in the motor cortex. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nGlucose induces site-specific differences in BOLD response in the human brain; the brainstem and hypothalamus show a CCK  receptor-independent reduction which is likely to be mediated by a circulatory effect of glucose and insulin, whereas the motor cortex shows an early dexloxiglumide-reversible increase in signal, suggesting a CCK  receptor-dependent neural pathway. \n\n   Highlights  \n  \nWe have identified two distinct CNS responses to glucose in man. \n  \nA CCK1 receptor (CCK1R)-dependent BOLD signal increase in the motor cortex. \n  \nA CCK1R-independent BOLD signal decrease in the brainstem and hypothalamus. \n  \nThe BOLD signal decrease was mediated by changes in blood glucose and insulin, \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nObesity is now one of the major public health problems facing the world. In 2005, 400\u00a0million adults were obese, and this is projected to increase to 700\u00a0million by 2015 ( ). This \u201cepidemic\u201d has prompted major scientific efforts to determine the mechanisms underlying the regulation of food intake in order to facilitate the development of effective therapies for obesity. A particular focus has been applied to nutrient-induced gut-to-brain signalling mechanisms. In human research, the development of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has resulted in the identification of a number of homeostatic and non-homeostatic brain regions associated with the regulation of appetite ( ). However, to date, the focus of these human studies has largely been the evaluation of higher centre cognitive responses to food cues (such as images of palatable food), rather than the physiological responses to meal ingestion. The more recent application of the physiological MRI (physMRI) technique ( ,  ) has allowed the exploration of BOLD signal responses to nutrients over time across the whole brain, in particular, in key areas involved in the regulation of food intake such as the brainstem and hypothalamus. \n\nIt is well established that the presence of glucose in the small intestinal lumen is associated with decreased hunger, increased fullness, and decreased energy intake at a subsequent meal ( ,  ,  ), but the brain centres and transduction mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly defined in humans. Animal studies have identified the hypothalamus as a critical region for the regulation of energy balance ( ,  ), and in man, a number of fMRI studies have reported that oral glucose decreases hypothalamic BOLD signal, relative to water ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). However, these studies did not investigate the responses of other sub-cortical brain regions to glucose, and the movement of the head during consumption of oral meals induced imaging artefacts that precluded evaluation of the early responses. In particular, detailed imaging of the human brainstem has not been reported and is critical as it is the first relay point responsible for integrating neural signals transmitted from the upper gut via vagal afferent neurons. \n\nThe mechanism by which the presence of glucose in the gut is signalled to the human central nervous system is likely to involve an interaction between direct responses to elevated circulating glucose concentrations ( ), and indirect responses via glucose sensitive neural (e.g. vagal), or endocrine signalling pathways (e.g. insulin ( ,  ) and/or gut derived peptides, such as cholecystokinin (CCK) ( ,  ) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) ( )). Recent studies have indicated that signals arising from the gastrointestinal tract are likely to play an important role in mediating the hypothalamic response to glucose. For example, the effect of glucose on hypothalamic BOLD signal has been reported to be greater when administered orally compared to intravenously ( ). The hypothalamic response has also been related to fasting insulin concentrations ( ,  ), and additionally a relationship has been found between postprandial plasma GLP-1 concentrations and increases in BOLD signal in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the hypothalamus, following ingestion of a liquid meal ( ). However, in these previous studies, whole brain responses, and time courses of the response could not be evaluated. \n\nUsing physMRI to investigate whole brain responses, we have previously shown that intragastrically administered lipid (the fatty acid, lauric acid (C12)) increases BOLD signal in key human brain areas, including the brainstem and hypothalamus ( ). These activations were abolished by the administration of the CCK  receptor antagonist, dexloxiglumide ( ), and modulated by ghrelin ( ). \n\nWe, therefore, decided to apply the same imaging technique to identify and define the brain regions responsive to glucose. Like lipid, glucose ingestion is known to slow gastric emptying ( ), and to induce gallbladder contraction ( ). In addition, dexloxiglumide attenuates the inhibitory effects of glucose on gastric emptying ( ,  ), suggesting that CCK is also involved in this, and possibly mediating the gut-to-brain signalling response to glucose. Therefore, the CNS response to different macronutrients may be predicted to have significant overlaps. \n\nThis study therefore had two aims: first, to determine whether intragastric glucose would induce changes in BOLD signal in the same nutrient-sensitive regions, robustly observed in response to lipid, namely the brainstem and hypothalamus, and second, to determine whether any effects of glucose observed in the CNS were also CCK  receptor-dependent. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \n12 healthy volunteers (7 males, mean (SEM) age: 38 (3.4) (range: 23\u201360) years) with a non-obese body mass index (BMI: 24 (1) (range: 19.7\u201328.9)\u00a0kg/m ) were recruited from the staff and local population of Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust. Exclusion criteria comprised: presence of any gastrointestinal, endocrine or metabolic disease; consumption of medications that may affect gastrointestinal function, sensation or appetite; metallic implants or objects (e.g. hearing aid, pacemaker), and consumption of greater than 20\u00a0g of alcohol or 10\u00a0cigarettes/day. All were instructed to abstain from alcohol and vigorous physical activity for 24\u00a0h prior to the study. In both the gastric emptying and the fMRI study arms, participants were blinded both to the nature of the intragastric infusions, and to the drug, and studies were performed in a randomised order. Randomisation was performed using a random number generator. Participants provided informed written consent. The study was approved by the Salford and Trafford Research Ethics Committee, and was carried out in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) and the standards established by the author's ethics committee and granting agency. All participants provided informed, written consent after the nature of the experimental procedures provided in writing. \n\n\n### Materials \n  \n-Glucose was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, England). The CCK  receptor antagonist, dexloxiglumide (300\u00a0mg tablets), and matched placebo tablets were supplied at no cost by Rottapharm (Monza, Italy) as a scientific collaboration. \n\n\n### Gastric emptying protocol \n  \nAs the medulla houses the sensory and motor nuclei responsible for relaying vago-vagal enteric circuits, as well as signalling to higher centres, we used the measurement of changes in gastric emptying induced by glucose as a convenient proxy measure to identify a dose of glucose that would have effects on brainstem BOLD response ( ). Participants arrived at the laboratory at 09:00\u00a0h after an overnight fast from 22:00\u00a0h and orally ingested either 600\u00a0mg of dexloxiglumide (1 occasion), or matched placebo (2 occasions), tablets. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that this dose effectively blocks the effects of lipid (lauric acid (C12)) ( ) and glucose ( ) on gastric emptying, and the effect of lipid on BOLD signal in the brainstem and hypothalamus ( ). One hour later, a nasogastric feeding tube was positioned, with its distal tip in the stomach. Gastric delivery was employed to eliminate sensory or hedonic effects of oral sweet tasting, and for the MRI studies, movement artefacts during drinking and swallowing. A basal, end-expiratory, breath sample was collected; following which participants received a bolus intragastric infusion of 250\u00a0ml glucose (45\u00a0g, 180\u00a0kcal, 1000\u00a0mOsmol) or 250\u00a0ml of water (volumetric control). Each meal was labelled with 100\u00a0mg  C-sodium acetate, used as a marker for gastric emptying (CK Gas Products Ltd., UK). For the assessment of gastric emptying rate, end-expiratory breath samples were collected at 5\u00a0minute intervals over a period of 45\u00a0min ( ,  ). On each occasion, the subject exhaled through a mouth-piece to collect an end-expiratory breath sample into a 100\u00a0ml foil bag, which was then sealed with a plastic stopper, and stored for later analysis. \n\nBreath samples were analysed by non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy (IRIS, Wagner Analysen Technik, Bremen, Germany). This enabled evaluation of the isotopic composition of carbon in the expired carbon dioxide (CO ) by determination of the ratio of  C: C in the sample ( ,  ).  C-acetate is rapidly absorbed and metabolized after it is emptied from the stomach, hence the rate of appearance of  CO  in the systemic circulation closely corresponds to the rate of GE ( ). \n\n\n### physMRI protocol \n  \n12 participants were studied on three separate occasions at 08:30\u00a0h following an overnight fast from 22:00\u00a0h, to evaluate the spatiotemporal pattern of brain activation in response to intragastric infusion of: (i) glucose (250\u00a0ml, 1000\u00a0mOsmol (45\u00a0g glucose, 180\u00a0kcal)) following two placebo tablets, (ii) glucose (250\u00a0ml, 1000\u00a0mOsmol) following the CCK  receptor antagonist, dexloxiglumide (600\u00a0mg (two 300\u00a0mg tablets)) (glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex), and (iii) 0.9% saline (control) following two placebo tablets. The dexloxiglumide (condition ii), or matched placebo, tablets (conditions i and iii), were orally ingested with 100\u00a0ml of water 1\u00a0h prior to the commencement of the intragastric infusion. All conditions were matched exactly to our previous studies ( ,  ) to enable direct comparison between the glucose- and lipid-induced nutrient matrices. In the study design we purposefully omitted a saline\u00a0+\u00a0dex control arm since we had previously demonstrated, under the same study conditions (i.e. after an overnight fast and with identical imaging parameters), that there was no effect of dexloxiglumide in the absence of nutrient (i.e. during intragastric saline infusion) on BOLD signal across the whole brain ( ). Furthermore, dexloxiglumide has no effect on the gastric emptying of water/saline ( ). Due to the large number of statistical comparisons to be performed, which do not require the placebo/placebo condition, and mindful of burden on experimental subjects, we considered that repeating this was unjustified. \n\nThirty minutes prior to scanning, participants were intubated with a nasogastric feeding tube and an intravenous cannula was positioned in an antecubital vein to enable repeated blood sampling. Participants were then positioned in the scanner (3.0\u00a0T Philips Achieva MR System, Magnetic Resonance Imaging Facility (MRIF), Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust) and images of the gallbladder acquired. Immediately following this, participants were repositioned in the scanner for the 30\u00a0minute fMRI scan. After a baseline period of 4\u00a0min, the intragastric infusion (glucose or saline) was administered as a bolus, using a syringe via the nasogastric tube, over a period of 1\u00a0min. Subjective ratings of fullness, hunger and nausea were recorded every 5\u00a0min throughout the scan. Venous blood samples were taken to assess blood glucose, and plasma insulin, CCK and GLP-1 concentrations at the start of the scan protocol (t\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0min), and then at t\u00a0=\u00a05, 10, 15, 20, and 25\u00a0min following the intragastric infusion. After the fMRI scan, a second gallbladder image was acquired. On the first visit, participants were positioned in the scanner an additional 10\u00a0min before the commencement of the scanning protocol to enable a high-resolution structural scan to be performed to more accurately normalise each individual's brain anatomy. \n\n\n### Gallbladder MR acquisition and volume measurement \n  \nGallbladder volume, which is a classical   in vivo   bioassay for CCK activity, was determined to evaluate the functional significance of the CCK response to the glucose test meals and as a positive control for CCK  receptor blockade by dexloxiglumide ( ). Complete blockade of gallbladder contraction demonstrates effective CCK  receptor antagonism. Volumes were determined from single-shot, T2 weighted axial, coronal and sagittal 3\u00a0T anatomical MR images of the upper abdomen obtained at the beginning and end of each study using a SENSE torso coil triggered by respiration. Gallbladder volume was estimated using the ellipsoid method, whereby volume\u00a0=\u00a0length\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0depth\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0width\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.523 (where \u03c0/6\u00a0=\u00a00.523, depth\u00a0=\u00a0maximum antero-posterior diameter and width\u00a0=\u00a0maximum lateral diameter) ( ,  ). \n\n\n### Sensation scores \n  \nSubjects were asked to indicate their sensations of hunger, fullness and nausea on a 10 point scale, every 5\u00a0min during each scan. The subject rated each sensation by moving a pointer along the scale, via a response box held in their right hand ( ). \n\n\n### Blood glucose, plasma insulin, CCK and GLP-1 measurements \n  \nVenous blood samples (10\u00a0ml) were collected into ice-chilled lithium heparin-treated tubes containing 400\u00a0kIU aprotinin per ml blood (Trasylol; Bayer Ltd., Berkshire, UK). Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 3000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C within 1\u00a0h of collection, and stored at \u2212\u00a070\u00a0\u00b0C until assayed. \n\nVenous blood glucose concentrations (mmol/l) were determined at the time of collection by the glucose oxidase method using a portable glucose meter (Medisense Optium Xceed, Abbott, Alameda CA USA). The accuracy of this method has been confirmed using the hexokinase technique ( ). \n\nPlasma insulin concentrations were determined using the ALPCO Insulin ELISA kit (ALPCO, Product number: 80-INSHU-E01.1, Salem, NH, USA). The sensitivity of the assay is 0.399\u00a0uIU/ml. The intra-assay coefficients of variability (CVs) were 5.1\u201310.3%, and the inter-assay CVs were 6.7\u201316.6%. \n\nPlasma GLP-1 concentrations were determined using the ALPCO GLP-1 (7\u201336) and GLP-1 (9\u201336) ELISA kit (ALPCO, Product number: 43-GPTHU-E01, Salem, NH, USA). The assay has 0.01% cross-reactivity with GLP-1 and glucagon. The sensitivity of this assay is 0.06\u00a0pmol/l. The intra-assay CVs were 3.7\u20134.7%, and the inter-assay CVs were 6.2\u20139.5%. \n\nPlasma CCK concentrations were determined using the ALPCO EURIA-CCK radioimmunoassay kit (ALPCO, Product number: 13-RB302). The assay has 0.5% cross-reactivity with gastrin-17 sulphated, and <\u00a00.01% with gastrin-17 non-sulphated. The sensitivity of the assay is 0.3\u00a0pmol/l. The intra-assay CVs were 2\u20135.5%, and the inter-assay CVs were 4.1\u201313.7%. \n\n\n### MRI acquisition \n  \nfMRI brain volumes were acquired at 5\u00a0second intervals for 30\u00a0min using a multi-slice, single-shot EPI sequence to achieve whole brain coverage: 40 axial slices, TR/TE\u00a0=\u00a05000/35\u00a0ms, voxel size\u00a0=\u00a01.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.5\u00a0mm, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a079\u00b0, SENSE acceleration factor\u00a0=\u00a01.8, matrix\u00a0=\u00a0128\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0128, FOV\u00a0=\u00a0240\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240\u00a0mm. Daily quality assurance was carried out to ensure a consistent high signal-to-ghost ratio using an automated quality control procedure. A SENSE 8 channel head coil was used for radio frequency transmission and reception. \n\n\n### MRI image analysis \n  \nThe fMRI data were analysed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8,  ). Images were realigned, spatially normalised and smoothed to facilitate inter-subject averaging. The limits on head movement for inclusion were: 2\u00a0mm for x- and y-translation and 4\u00a0mm for z-translation, both per volume and across the whole scan, and 3\u00b0 for yaw and 1.5\u00b0 for roll and pitch, again per volume and across the whole scan. \n\nFirst-level analysis was performed, using the p-block ph/physMRI analysis technique ( ,  ,  ,  ), on each subject for each study condition in the following ways: the pre- and post-infusion scans were split into two minute time-bins. The post-infusion scans were divided into 13 consecutive 2\u00a0minute time bins (T1\u201313) and the 24 scans from the 2\u00a0min immediately prior to the glucose/saline infusion formed the baseline time bin (T0). In each subject and condition, the signal averages for the 13 post-infusion time bins (T1\u2013T13) were separately compared to the baseline average (T0) using regression within the general linear model framework. This resulted in 13 first level images corresponding to the BOLD signal change from baseline in each successive post-infusion time bin for each subject and condition. The realignment parameters for each session were included as regressors of no interest to correct for motion. Scanner drift was modelled using the scaling option for global normalisation in SPM. Contrast maps across time for glucose vs. saline and glucose vs. glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex were calculated for each subject. \n\nTo determine whether statistically significant increments in the BOLD signal change from baseline across subjects occurred over time, two repeated-measures ANOVAs were used, one for the glucose vs. saline comparison and the other for the glucose vs. glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex comparison, at a cluster-level statistical inference of p(False Discovery Rate; FDRc)\u00a0<\u00a00.05 at a height threshold of p\u00a0=\u00a00.005. \n\nCorrelations were performed to determine relationships between changes in BOLD signal with blood glucose, plasma GLP-1 and insulin concentrations, and the subjective ratings of nausea, hunger and fullness. These were performed using the average values per subject (area under the curve (AUC) and across time) for each significant cluster extracted from the glucose vs. saline and glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex vs. saline comparisons. For the AUC correlations, all time bin BOLD signal change contrasts were averaged per cluster and compared to the baseline corrected AUC blood concentrations for each individual. For the correlations with time, each cluster's average BOLD signal at five time bins (T\u00a0+\u00a05, T\u00a0+\u00a010, T\u00a0+\u00a015, T\u00a0+\u00a020 and T\u00a0+\u00a025\u00a0min) was calculated and correlated to the each subject's blood concentration measures at the same time points. This resulted in a correlation coefficient, r, for each subject. Each subject's r-values were then entered into a one-sample   t  -test. All correlations are reported at a False Discovery Rate level (pFDR\u00a0<\u00a00.05) correcting for the number of cluster significant regions being tested. \n\n\n### Analysis of gastric emptying, blood glucose and GI hormone concentrations and appetite perceptions \n  \nGastric emptying, blood glucose, plasma CCK, GLP-1 and insulin concentrations are displayed as raw data. VAS scores were analysed as change from baseline values. Areas under the curve were calculated for gastric emptying and blood glucose, CCK, GLP-1 and insulin concentrations using the trapezoidal rule. These data were analysed using repeated measures ANOVAs with treatment, and time (or for the AUC data, treatment) as factors. If ANOVAs revealed statistical significance, post-hoc paired comparisons, corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni's correction, were performed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Version 17.0. Data are presented as means (SEM). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe study was well tolerated by all participants. Due to difficulty obtaining blood samples from 2 of the participants while in the scanner, complete data sets for glucose, insulin, CCK and GLP-1 are available from only 10 participants. Three participants self-reported smoking\u00a0\u2264\u00a0three cigarettes/day. There were no apparent differences in gastric emptying, BOLD response or gut peptide secretion between the smokers and non-smokers, but this could not be formally evaluated due to the small numbers. \n\n### Gastric emptying \n  \nAs in our previous study ( ), we demonstrated an effect of treatment on gastric emptying (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Intragastric glucose slowed gastric emptying when compared with water (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017), and dexloxiglumide abolished this glucose-induced inhibition (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031), with no difference between the emptying of water and glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex. The slower gastric emptying observed after glucose consumption is therefore CCK -receptor dependent ( A).   \n(A) Gastric emptying (n\u00a0=\u00a03/12) and (B) change in gallbladder volume (n\u00a0=\u00a012) following intragastric glucose (1000\u00a0mOsmol), glucose (1000\u00a0mOsmol)\u00a0+\u00a0dexloxiglumide (600\u00a0mg) or saline/water control. Data are mean (SEM). *glucose vs. water/saline, ^glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex vs. glucose, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05. \n  \n\n\n### Gallbladder volumes \n  \nThere was an effect of intragastric glucose on gallbladder volume ( B). Glucose decreased the volume of the gallbladder (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014) when compared with saline. As with gastric emptying, the effect of glucose was attenuated by dexloxiglumide pre-treatment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). This provides evidence of fully effective CCK  receptor blockade by dexloxiglumide. \n\n\n### Areas of glucose-induced BOLD signal change \n  \nResults of the one-way ANOVAs investigating the differences in BOLD signal responses over time following intragastric glucose (relative to saline) are presented in   and  ,  . A significant effect of time was observed in sections of the brainstem ( A, B, C) and hypothalamus ( D) (regions previously reported to show a positive BOLD response between lipid and saline ( ,  )), as well as the cerebellum, right fusiform and lingual gyri, insula/putamen, left parahippocampal gyrus, right middle temporal and thalamic regions. Investigation of the average time courses for these significant clusters highlighted that the effect of time was generally driven by an initial increase in BOLD signal followed by sharp decrease at 5\u00a0min ( ).   \nSignificant central nervous system clusters exhibiting effect of time between glucose and saline infusions: p(FDRc\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at p\u00a0=\u00a00.005.

Investigation of the average time courses for the significant clusters highlighted partial blockade of the effect of glucose to decrease BOLD signal in the hypothalamus ( D). The supplementary motor area is of particular interest as this was the only region to show a positive BOLD response to glucose ingestion (glucose vs. saline) over time, an effect that was abolished by dexloxiglumide ( E). Investigation of the average time course in the other brain regions in   showed that effect of time was driven in two separate ways: 1) for the cerebellum, left caudate, left and right cuneus, and left lingual gyrus, the effect of time was driven by the BOLD response for glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex vs. saline being further reduced relative to glucose vs. saline, and 2) for the other regions the effect of time was driven by the initial glucose-induced increase in BOLD signal and subsequent sharp decrease at 5\u00a0min being abolished by dexloxiglumide pretreatment.   \nSignificant central nervous system clusters exhibiting effect of time between glucose infusion and glucose infusion following pretreatment with dexloxiglumide p(FDRc\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at p\u00a0=\u00a00.005.

This temporal correlation was removed by pretreatment with dexloxiglumide in all of these regions, apart from the lateral cerebellum and the right occipital cortex (fusiform and lingual gyrus). A temporal correlation between the glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex vs. saline BOLD signal with insulin was also observed in the left parahippocampal region. There were no significant correlations between BOLD signal changes with the AUC of blood glucose, GI hormones or subjective appetite measures. There were no significant temporal correlations between BOLD signal changes with GLP-1, or any of the subjective appetite measures. \n\nWith respect to clusters that showed a significant modulation of the glucose-induced BOLD signal by dexloxiglumide, there were correlations between the time course of the BOLD signal change with the time course of blood glucose and insulin concentrations in the hypothalamus, cerebellum, right putamen, left lingual gyrus and left precuneus ( ). There were no temporal correlations between the time course for blood glucose and the time course for the glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex vs. saline BOLD signal in any region, however, there were temporal correlations observed with insulin and GLP-1 in the cerebellum, bilateral cuneus and left lingual gyrus i.e. the clusters that showed an the effect of time driven by the BOLD response for glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex vs. saline being further reduced in comparison to glucose vs. saline. Interestingly, in the supplementary motor area, where BOLD signal increased in response to glucose (and where the effect was reversed by dexloxiglumide), there was no temporal correlation with circulating blood glucose, insulin or GLP-1 concentrations ( ). There were no significant correlations between BOLD signal changes and the AUC of blood glucose, hormones or subjective appetite measures. There were no significant temporal correlations with BOLD for any of the subjective appetite measures. \n\n\n### Blood glucose, plasma insulin, CCK and GLP-1 concentrations \n  \n#### Glucose \n  \nThere was an effect of treatment on blood glucose concentrations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Both glucose (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) increased blood glucose concentrations when compared with saline, with no difference between glucose and glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex (p\u00a0=\u00a01.000) ( A).   \nBlood glucose (A) and plasma insulin (B), cholecystokinin (CCK) (C) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (D) concentrations following bolus intragastric glucose (1000\u00a0mOsmol), glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dexloxiglumide, or saline (0.9%). *glucose vs. saline, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, ^glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex vs. saline, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, #glucose vs. glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, n\u00a0=\u00a010. \n  \n\n\n#### Insulin \n  \nThere was an effect of treatment on the AUC for serum insulin concentrations (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Both glucose (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) increased serum insulin concentrations when compared with saline. There was a treatment\u00a0\u2217\u00a0time interaction (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Insulin concentrations were greater for glucose and glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex between t\u00a0=\u00a05\u201325\u00a0min, when compared with saline, and greater for glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex when compared with glucose at t\u00a0=\u00a025\u00a0min ( B). \n\n\n#### CCK \n  \nThere was an effect of treatment on the AUC for plasma CCK concentrations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). CCK was increased following glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex when compared with glucose (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) and saline (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), with no differences between glucose and saline (p\u00a0=\u00a00.395) ( C). \n\n\n#### GLP-1 \n  \nThere was an effect of treatment on the AUC for plasma GLP-1 concentrations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) ( D). Glucose increased plasma GLP-1 concentrations when compared with saline (p\u00a0=\u00a00.047), with no difference between glucose and glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex, or glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex and saline. \n\n\n\n### Perceptions of hunger, fullness and nausea \n  \nThere were no differences in baseline ratings, nor any effect of any treatment, on perceptions of nausea ( A) or hunger ( B). There was an effect of treatment for fullness scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Glucose increased fullness when compared with saline (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009), with no differences between saline and glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex ( C).   \nEffects of saline, glucose and glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dexloxiglumide on perceptions of nausea (A), hunger (B) and fullness (C). There were no differences in baseline ratings, nor any effect of any treatment, on perceptions of nausea or hunger. There was an effect of treatment for fullness scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Glucose increased fullness when compared with saline (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009), with no differences between saline and glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex. *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 glucose vs. saline. \n  \n\nChanges in fullness were not correlated to circulating levels of glucose, CCK, GLP-1 or insulin. Ratings of hunger were weakly related to plasma insulin (R\u00a0=\u00a00.36, P\u00a0=\u00a00.052), but not CCK, glucose or GLP-1, concentrations. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe development of whole brain fMRI applied to intragastric infusion of nutrients (physiological MRI; physMRI) has provided an entirely new means to understand the gut-to-brain signalling mechanisms regulating gastrointestinal function, appetite and food intake in humans ( ,  ). We have now, for the first time, demonstrated the whole brain responses to glucose when administered directly into the stomach to avoid the confounding effects of sight, taste or smell, and overcoming the technical issues associated with movement during swallowing. In the medulla, pons, and midbrain regions of the brainstem and in the hypothalamus (and other areas outlined in  ) glucose, compared to the saline, decreased the BOLD signal at 5\u00a0min, after a small initial increase. The brainstem and hypothalamic regions have previously been identified to respond to intragastric lipid, using identical methods ( ,  ). However, in response to glucose, the decrease in BOLD signal was temporally correlated to the increases in blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations. \n\nSince CCK clearly mediated gastric and gall bladder emptying following intragastric glucose, the role of CCK in the CNS response to intragastric infusion of glucose was investigated using a pretreatment with dexloxiglumide (a CCK  receptor antagonist). Investigation of the interaction between glucose and glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex over time revealed several interesting results. There was a partial blocking of the effect of glucose to decrease BOLD signal in the hypothalamus by dexloxiglumide. Dexloxiglumide furthermore abolished the effect of glucose in the motor cortex, the only region to show a BOLD signal increase in response to glucose. In the cerebellum, left caudate, bilateral cuneus and left lingual gyrus, dexloxiglumide pre-treatment further reduced the glucose BOLD response. Interestingly, there was a significant temporal correlation with insulin and GLP-1 in all these regions apart from the left caudate. For the remaining regions dexloxiglumide changed the temporal characteristics of the glucose response by abolishing the initial increase in BOLD signal as observed for glucose vs. saline. \n\nWith regard to the areas showing decreased BOLD signal, our observations confirm previous reports of a decrease in BOLD signal within the hypothalamus following either oral or intravenous glucose in humans ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), and rats ( ,  ), and for the first time define the brainstem response to the presence of glucose in the GI tract in humans. In seeking to explore candidate pathways for these effects of glucose to decrease BOLD signal in the CNS regions outlined in  , our dexloxiglumide data indicate that, unlike the response to lipid ( ), the response to glucose in these regions is not solely dependent on the activation of CCK  receptors on vagal afferents. Even though we demonstrated that glucose does activate processes known to be CCK-dependent (i.e. dexloxiglumide reversible gallbladder contraction and slowing of gastric emptying ( ,  ,  )), there was no significant effect of dexloxiglumide on BOLD signal reduction in these regions. This suggests that although glucose is likely to have activated a subset of neurons via the CCK  receptor (as demonstrated by the dexloxiglumide sensitive increase in BOLD signal in cortical areas and possibly the small initial rise in BOLD signal observed prior to the decrease in the brainstem), there was also an additional, perhaps more direct, inhibitory action of circulating glucose and insulin, which may have occurred at the level of peripheral vagal afferents, and/or the brainstem and hypothalamus. This is supported by the observation that in rats, BOLD signal responses in the lateral hypothalamus, as well as other brain regions, to post-oral glucose were the same in both intact and vagotomised rats, whereas BOLD signal responses to glutamine were attenuated in vagotomised rats. This suggests that specific responses occur to different types of nutrients, with vagal activity being critical for the sensing of glutamine and lipid ( ), and humoral factors, such as insulin, as well as changes in circulating glucose levels, being important for glucose detection ( ). To this effect a direct comparison of our independent studies using intragastric lipid and glucose has been provided as supplementary data. \n\nIt is recognised that elevated glucose levels can directly influence the activity of specific glucose-sensing neurons in hypothalamic and brainstem regions ( ), and that there are subsets of neurons in which elevated glucose levels are either excitatory or inhibitory ( ,  ). In addition, elevated blood glucose may have been signalling to the brain via activation (excitation or inhibition) of peripheral glucose-sensing neurons in the nodose ganglia ( ). Animal studies strongly indicate that vago-vagal pathways play an important role in the regulation of gastrointestinal motility ( ) and eating behaviour ( ) in response to acute changes in blood glucose levels. Additionally, acute increases in glucose levels modulate synaptic connections between vagal afferent nerve terminals and neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius ( ). However, while one study has demonstrated an effect of intravenous glucose on BOLD signal in the hypothalamus ( ), this effect was not replicated by others, despite inducing comparable increases in blood glucose concentrations ( ). A number of studies have reported no relationship between blood glucose concentrations and glucose-induced changes in BOLD signal in the hypothalamus ( ,  ). Here, we have demonstrated a strong correlation between the timing of changes in blood glucose and plasma insulin levels, and the decrease in BOLD signal, suggesting that changes in circulating glucose and insulin concentrations are likely to be key mediators of the central response to glucose, rather than direct vagal afferent signalling from the gut. \n\nWhile we did demonstrate that dexloxiglumide accelerated gastric emptying of glucose, this was not of a sufficient magnitude to modulate circulating glucose or insulin levels, and indeed, in the CNS regions in which we observed a significant relationship with glucose and insulin (i.e. those regions in which BOLD signal decreased), there was no difference in effect between glucose and glucose\u00a0+\u00a0dex conditions. Hence, gastric emptying rate is unlikely to be a major determinant of the CNS response reported here. \n\nIt appears from our data that the onset of the BOLD signal rise in the motor cortex was rapid, occurring within 5\u00a0min post-infusion and before any measurable elevation of plasma glucose. Further analysis of the direct comparison between glucose and lipid BOLD responses, using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with nutrient (vs. saline) as a between subject factor and time as a within subject factor, highlighted the spatial similarity and temporal interaction between glucose and lipid ( ,  ) related changes in BOLD signal (Supplementary material). The data included in this comparison were collected in parallel on the same scanner with the same imaging parameters during the same time period. The motor cortex was not significant in this analysis due to a lack of direct overlap in the motor cortex for glucose and lipid however the time course for lipid from the motor cortex in  D from   and in  A in this paper are very similar (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Previous studies have also demonstrated that cortical areas (including the motor cortex) display an increase in BOLD signal during intravenous glucose ( ). That this response was blocked by dexloxiglumide suggests that the early changes in BOLD signal were mediated by a peripheral vagal CCK  receptor-dependent pathway. This is supported by a recent study that identified a positive relationship between changes in BOLD signal in the thalamus, amygdala, caudate, insula and orbitofrontal cortex with changes in plasma CCK concentrations following oral glucose ingestion ( ). The current study however went beyond pure observation and utilised the CCK  receptor antagonist dexloxiglumide, which we have previously shown to abolish the effect of lipid. Therefore this correlation cannot be causal: the fact that BOLD changes are in opposing directions in our study would make an identical signalling molecule driving both rather implausible. We validated that CCK activity was fully blockaded in our study by demonstrating the abolition of glucose-induced gallbladder contraction: measuring peripheral blood levels of CCK is clearly a poor assay of biological activity in this system, since much of the effects of CCK occur at a paracrine level within the gut. Where possible, physiology is better explored by using interventions such as receptor blockade. \n\nIt therefore appears that the effects of intestinal glucose are mediated by at least two nutrient sensing pathways in the CNS, both of which may modify appetite, eating behaviour and digestive function either directly (e.g. central detection of circulating insulin/glucose concentrations) or indirectly (e.g. activation of vagal afferents via gut peptides). \n\nIt should also be noted that intragastric infusion, while having benefits of ensuring consistent rate of nutrient delivery to the intestine and allowing a pure focus on gut-to-brain signals, does not entirely reflect normal meal ingestion due to the exclusion of oral and cephalic phases. For example, our analyses did not reveal relationships between BOLD signal changes with appetite perceptions. These analyses are likely to be underpowered since we were unable to collect blood from two participants while they were in the scanner. Additionally, subjective ratings of hunger and fullness in several subjects showed no change from pre-infusion baseline and, therefore, could not be correlated with BOLD responses. We ended up with data for n\u00a0=\u00a06 for hunger, and n\u00a0=\u00a07 for fullness, in these models. In the included subjects, the increase in fullness and reduction in hunger were very small in magnitude and blood and VAS scores were collected at 5\u00a0min intervals, therefore there was less temporal resolution in comparison to the initial BOLD analysis which was done using 2\u00a0minute time bins. The small magnitude of change in VAS scores was not unexpected, since it is well established that intragastric infusion has less potent effects on appetite perceptions than oral consumption ( ). Future work using this paradigm should investigate the effects of these additional components during meal ingestion. \n\nOf interest, it has recently been shown that GLP-1 in response to lipid is inhibited by dexloxiglumide indicating dependence on CCK receptor activation ( ). This dependence does not appear to be the case in response to glucose stimulation and probably implicates a direct action of glucose on GLP-1 producing enteric mucosal cells. \n\nThe other brain regions responding to glucose, including the cerebellum, thalamus, precuneus and motor cortex have been consistently demonstrated in our previous studies to respond to nutrient ingestion and or gut hormones (i.e. ghrelin) ( ,  ), suggesting that they play a role in mediating the gastrointestinal and appetite responses to ingested food. In particular, the cerebellum has been shown to play an important role in food intake ( ). \n\nIn conclusion this study provides important new information about whole brain responses to intragastric glucose in man, and demonstrates that multiple mechanisms operate to modulate BOLD signal in the nutrient-induced brain matrix. \n\n\n## Disclosures \n  \nTJL, SM, RBJ, RMC, JT and DGT have no conflict of interest to declare.

We combined binaural monopolar galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize the cortical networks activated during antero-posterior and lateral stimulations in humans. We focused on functional areas that selectively respond to egomotion-consistent optic flow patterns: the human middle temporal complex (hMT+), V6, the ventral intraparietal (VIP) area, the cingulate sulcus visual (CSv) area and the posterior insular cortex (PIC). Areas hMT+, CSv, and PIC were equivalently responsive during lateral and antero-posterior GVS while areas VIP and V6 were highly activated during antero-posterior GVS, but remained silent during lateral GVS. Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, we confirmed that a cortical network including areas V6 and VIP is engaged during antero-posterior GVS. Our results suggest that V6 and VIP play a specific role in processing multisensory signals specific to locomotion during navigation. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSelf-motion (egomotion) perception permits us to estimate our on-going change of position within the surrounding space to properly interact with our environment. In the brain, egomotion is processed from multisensory inputs, particularly vestibular and visual ones whose integration remains poorly understood (e.g., Britten,  ). \n\nIn macaques, several groups have shown vestibular projections in the medial superior temporal area (MST), a visual area involved in object-motion and self-motion perception based on optic flow (Duffy,  ; Bremmer et al.,  ; Gu et al.,  ). MST projects towards the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) that is sensitive to visual heading and receives vestibular inputs (Klam and Graf,  , ). A recent study demonstrated that the visual posterior area (VPS), located at the posterior end of the Sylvian fissure, also contains multi-sensory neurons that process both optic flow and vestibular signals (Chen et al.,  ). \n\nIn humans, neuroimaging studies revealed several brain regions involved in visual egomotion processing. For example, Wall and Smith ( ) found that the ventral intraparietal (VIP) and the cingulate sulcus visual (CSv) areas had selective responses to optic flow patterns that are compatible with those received by our retina during locomotion (i.e., a selectivity to egomotion-consistent optic flows). A preference for egomotion-consistent visual pattern, although weaker, was also reported in human MST (Morrone et al.,  ). Human MST might, therefore, constitute an intermediate stage of egomotion processing which is further developed in areas VIP and CSv. A follow-up study (Cardin and Smith,  ) used wide-field visual stimuli to demonstrate that putative area V6 and two vestibular areas, the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC) and putative area 2v, in the postcentral sulcus (p2v) were also included in a network processing egomotion. As the natural stimulus for the vestibular apparatus, head motion, is incompatible with functional neuroimaging constraints, artificial vestibular stimulation is needed. Both caloric and galvanic stimulations are the two main methods used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) designs (see Lopez et al.,  ). Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) presents the advantage of providing stimulation that: (1) involves all vestibular afferents (Fitzpatrick and Day,  ) as it has been recently evidenced on behaving primates (Kwan et al.,  ); and (2) may be orientated differently according to electrodes position and polarisation (S\u00e9verac Cauquil et al.,  ; Aoyama et al.,  ). Using GVS, Smith et al. ( , see also Billington and Smith,  ) showed that MST and CSv were also vestibularly-driven, which strengthen their role in egomotion processing. In the same study, responses to GVS in V6 and VIP were very weak if not absent. However, these authors used the classical binaural bipolar configuration where the anode is placed on one mastoid and the cathode on the other. In this case, GVS is known to elicit a lateral postural tilt towards the anode when the body is free to move (e.g., Njiokiktjien and Folkerts,  ; Nashner and Wolfson,  ; Lund and Broberg,  ), but also a feeling of motion in the opposite, yet lateral, direction (Fitzpatrick et al.,  ; Fitzpatrick and Day,  ). These responses are compatible with an activation of the parts of the vestibular apparatus sensitive to roll tilt, in the frontal plane (S\u00e9verac Cauquil et al.,  ; Day et al.,  ). Therefore, such a GVS design prohibits the investigation of the contribution of the antero-posterior motion signal. Yet, human motion, in particular locomotion, mostly refers to forward displacements: it principally includes translational egomotion in the postero-anterior (i.e., forward) direction. If walking and running involve a complex pattern of acceleration and deceleration that also comprises vertical translation and sagittal rotation, these components are nevertheless minimized to stabilize the head (Pozzo et al.,  ). The cortical networks engaged in visuo-vestibular integration during antero-posterior egomotion might, therefore, be different from those involved during lateral egomotion. The different pathways followed for motion-in-depth processing compared to lateral motion, V3A, and hMT+ being specifically involved in the former, processing supports this hypothesis (Cottereau et al.,  ). So does the finding that different areas such as MST and V6 would encompass dissociated components of self-motion from optic flows, i.e., heading for the former and obstacle avoiding for the latter (Cardin et al.,  ). \n\nIn the present study, we (1) reproduced Smith et al.\u2019s ( ) paradigm using different stimulation parameters to determine whether the set of visual areas that they found can be reliably activated by a different type of lateral GVS. We also (2) determined whether antero-posterior vestibular inputs activated a different cortical network. In that aim, we used binaural monopolar GVS, since this design (although much less common) has been shown to induce a body response and self-motion illusion in the antero-posterior plane (S\u00e9verac Cauquil et al.,  ,  ; Magnusson et al.,  ; Aoyama et al.,  ): forward when anodes are on the forehead and backward with anodes over the mastoid processes. Such postural tilts in the antero-posterior direction fit with the model proposed by Day et al. ( ). They postulate that by polarizing equally both vestibular apparatus, binaural monopolar GVS provides a fake backward or forward self-motion input. Among several studies indicating that GVS induces a postural tilt towards the anodes, counteracting the action direction (away from the anodes), the most recent demonstrated the perfect adequacy between subjective perceptual responses and objectively quantified head movements, for both lateral and antero-posterior GVS stimulations (Aoyama et al.,  ). Here, we combine this tool with fMRI to differentiate the visual cortical networks activated during antero-posterior (AP) and lateral (L) GVS. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThirteen healthy human subjects (mean age 28.4, range 19\u201345, seven females) were included in this study. Eleven were right-handed, as assessed with the Edinburgh Inventory (Oldfield,  ). They all participated in the galvanic stimulation experiment. Eleven of them also performed an additional experiment that included functional localizers. All subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision reported no history of neurological or psychiatric disease, and gave written informed consent before participation, following the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was approved by the local ethics committee (ID RCB: 2012-A01052-41). Subjects received 80 euros of monetary compensation for their participation. \n\n\n### Stimuli and Design \n  \n#### Galvanic Stimulation \n  \nVestibular stimuli consisting of 2 s of 1 mA square-pulses were delivered by two identical dedicated current-limited stimulators [DS5, Digitimer, UK, CE certified for biomedical research N(IEC) 60601] through four disposable carbon electrodes (Skintact, FSWB00) placed on the forehead and over the mastoid processes (see  ). \n  \nGalvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) procedure.   (A)   The two antero-posterior configurations.   (B)   The two lateral configurations.   (C)   Sham configuration.   (D)   Representation of behavioral results. Inverted triangles give the   p  - and   t  -values of the permutation tests for each subject. \n  \nThe stimulators were localized outside the scanner room and were connected to screen cables through a waveguide. Four GVS configurations were used. Two bilateral monopolar configurations with anodes over the mastoids ( , top) or the forehead ( , bottom), respectively permitted to elicit vestibular activations consistent with a forward or backward motion of the body (antero-posterior GVS). Two bilateral bipolar conditions with anode right/cathode left ( , top) or cathode right/anode left ( , bottom) permitted to evoke activations consistent with leftward or rightward motion (lateral GVS). The amplitude of the postural reaction is known to vary with GVS intensity until reaching a plateau (S\u00e9verac Cauquil et al.,  ). For that reason, on top of obvious avoidance of tactile or even painful stimulation, we chose to use low, 1 mA, GVS intensity. Therefore, because the subjects were not always aware of the stimulation, a beep sound informed them every time a stimulation was delivered. As a baseline, we used a no-GVS condition that started with a beep but without any stimulation. Data were collected using an event-related design within which runs lasted 5 min (300 s) and comprised 40 events (eight for each of our five conditions). The time interval between the two condition onsets was fixed to 7.5 s. Behavioral responses were recorded during the scans: subjects were instructed to perform a forced-choice task using a 4-button box. After each beep, they had to press either the left or the right button to report whether they had experienced a sensation of self-motion along the lateral axis (L) or either the up or the down button in case of antero-posterior, AP, self-motion. The statistical significance of these L vs. AP responses were evaluated for each subject through permutations tests ( ). For these permutation tests, we computed 10,000 synthetic means by randomly subsampling 27 trials from the 54 of the sham condition. We generated representative distributions of these mean values. A   z  -score and its corresponding   p  -value were then obtained by dividing the observed mean for the subjects in the stimulation trials by the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution generated by the permutation tests (and always centered on ~1). \n\nTo control that our fMRI results were caused by vestibular activations rather than by somatosensory effects induced by the galvanic stimulation, we also designed a sham condition during which the same stimulation (i.e., a 2 s square pulse of 1 mA) was only delivered between the two frontal electrodes ( ). Responses to these stimulations were recorded during a separated run of 5 min that comprised 40 events whose onsets were separated by 7.5 s. The GVS and sham runs were conducted in total darkness on subjects instructed to keep their eyes closed during the whole recording to avoid any visual stimulation. We discuss the possible implications of eye movements on our results in the \u201cControl for Vergence\u201d section. \n\n\n#### Localizers for Areas Responding to Egomotion-Compatible Optic Flow \n  \nIn this study, our main analyses were performed within functionally defined Regions of Interest (ROIs) that preferentially respond to egomotion compatible optic flow. This ROI-based approach enables us to directly compare ROI data across subjects. It also gets rid of the multiple comparisons problem because statistics are only performed within the predefined ROIs (see e.g., Poldrack,  ). To localize the cortical areas that respond to egomotion-compatible optic flow, we used the stimuli described in previous studies (see e.g., Wall and Smith,  ; Cardin and Smith,  ). It consisted of 500 moving white dots displayed at 60 Hz on a black background and arranged in an egomotion-consistent (EC) or egomotion-inconsistent (EI) optic flow pattern. In the EC condition, the optic flow pattern had both expansion/contraction and rotation components that varied over time, consistent with self-motion on a varying spiral trajectory (Morrone et al.,  ). The EI stimulus consisted of a 3 \u00d7 3 array of nine identical panels, each containing a smaller version of the EC stimulus. Although the individual panels contained optic flow, the overall pattern was not consistent with egomotion because flow induced by observer motion can have only one center of motion. Stimuli were presented using a block-design. Runs consisted of 224 s (3 min, 44 s) divided into seven identical cycles of 32 s. In half of the runs, a cycle started with a baseline of 10 s where only the fixation point was present. It was followed by 6 s of the EC condition, then by another 10 s of blank and finally by 6 s of the EI condition. In the other half of the runs, the EC and EI conditions were inverted within a cycle (i.e., a cycle had 10 s of blank, 6 s of the EI condition, 10 s of blank, and finally 6 s of the EC condition). During the recordings, subjects were instructed to passively keep their eye on the central fixation point. They, however, all reported that the EC conditions elicited a strong percept of egomotion. \n\nThe localizers for the ROI responding to egomotion-compatible optic flow were presented via an LCD projector, back-projected onto a screen positioned at the end of the scanner bore, and viewed through a mirror mounted on the head coil. The viewing distance was 130 cm. It led to squared stimuli of 16\u00b0\u00d716\u00b0. \n\n\n#### Data Acquisition \n  \nAll the data were collected on a 3T scanner (Philips Achieva), using a standard 32 channels head coil. The functional data were acquired using (T2*-weighted) echoplanar imaging (EPI). The data for the main experiment (GVS) were collected during the first session. The data for the functional localizers were collected during a second session. \n\nFor the GVS experiment, we used the following prescription that is quite generic for whole-brain recordings: repetition time (TR) = 2.5 s, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, voxel size 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm, no gap thickness, flip angle (FA) = 77\u00b0, SENSE factor = 2.8. Each run comprised 120 volumes of 41 transversally oriented slices that covered the whole brain. In total, we collected 10 runs (eight runs with the four main conditions and the baseline and two additional runs with the sham stimulations, see the \u201cGalvanic Stimulation\u201d section above). The total duration of the recordings was about 45 min. \n\nFor the functional localizers, because the cortical regions that selectively respond to egomotion consistent optic flow are now well established in the occipital and parietal regions (see e.g., Cardin and Smith,   or Smith et al.,  ), we used a prescription specifically designed to optimize the resolution of BOLD recordings in these particular regions: TR: 2 s; TE: 30 ms; the field of view (FOV): 210 mm; voxel size 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm; no gap thickness, SENSE factor: 2.5. A run comprised 96 volumes of 33 slices that covered occipital and parietal cortices. We recorded four runs in total (two for each condition). \n\nBoth the two sessions of recordings also included the acquisition of a high-resolution anatomic image using a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence (160 slices; TR: 2,300 ms; TE: 3.93 ms; FA: 12\u00b0; FOV: 256 mm; voxel size 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm). These anatomical images were first co-registered and then averaged together to be used as a reference to which the functional images from all the experiments were aligned. \n\n\n#### Data Analyses \n  \n##### Pre-processing \n  \nAll the fMRI data were analyzed using the Brain Voyager QX software (v2.8, Brain Innovation) and Matlab. Pre-processing included slice scan time correction, 3D motion correction using trilinear/sinc interpolation, and high-pass filtering (0.01 Hz). For each subject, functional data were co-registered on the anatomy. Functional and anatomical data were brought into ACPC space using cubic spline interpolation and then transformed into standard Talairach (TAL) space (Talairach and Tournoux,  ). \n\n\n##### Region of Interest (ROI) Definition \n  \nFor each subject who performed the localizers experiment (  n   = 11), we determined the areas responding to egomotion compatible optic flow (V6, VIP, CSv, hMT+, and PIC) using the contrast between egomotion-consistent (EC) vs. inconsistent (IC) optic flow conditions (see the \u201cLocalizers for Areas Responding to Egomotion-Compatible Optic Flow\u201d section above). Except for area V6 for which we used the adaptive statistical threshold procedure proposed in (Cardin et al.,  ; see below), our functional areas were defined using a threshold of   p   < 0.001 (uncorrected). \n\nV6 seed was determined as the most significant voxel within the parieto-occipital sulcus (POS) for the EC vs. EI contrast. We then grew a V6 cluster around this seed by reducing the threshold until the point in which the cluster started to expand outside the POS (Cardin et al.,  ). We defined V6 at this threshold. This approach led to the successful identification of area V6 in 10 out of our 11 subjects who underwent the localizers. Because our V6 ROI was not defined from wide-field retinotopic mapping (see e.g., Pitzalis et al.,  ), we cannot be certain about the exact limit of this ROI. We, therefore, propose a control analysis to determine if this uncertainty impacts our results (see the \u201cResults\u201d section). \n\nUsing the same contrast between egomotion-consistent (EC) vs. inconsistent (EI) optic flow, we also defined the VIP area. This was the cortical region in the anterior part of the intraparietal sulcus and close to the intersection with the post-central sulcus that was significantly more activated during the EC condition. This location matches with the one reported in the original study of Bremmer et al. ( ), and is consistent with the definition of VIP described in Smith et al. ( ). Using this definition, we were able to define VIP bilaterally in seven of our subjects. For another three subjects, we localized VIP in one hemisphere but not in the other. Then, for each subject, the data corresponding to an ROI that was found bilaterally was averaged across hemispheres. \n\nWith the same approach, we defined area CSv in all our subjects and the human middle temporal complex hMT+ in 10 of our 11 subjects. This region was localized within the ascending branch of the inferior temporal sulcus (ITS; see Kolster et al.,  ) and includes MT, MST, and possibly other few motion regions like the putative fundus of the superior temporal area (pFST). Finally, our contrast also revealed a visually responsive region in the vicinity of the parieto-insular cortex (PIC) in nine of our subjects. This region corresponds to an area originally described by Sunaert et al. ( ), and that responds more strongly to the egomotion-consistent stimuli (see Billington and Smith,  ). PIC was recently proposed as a putative homolog of macaque VPS (Frank et al.,  ), anatomically and functionally distinct from the PIVC since PIC is activated, and PIVC suppressed by visual stimulation (Frank and Greenlee,  ). To investigate the differences between these two areas, we included PIVC as a supplementary ROI. Since it was not possible to localize it from our visual localizers, we defined it by using published average coordinates of PIVC (Frank et al.,  ): a sphere of 300 voxels was drawn around the center of Talairach coordinates (\u221243, \u221214, 17 and 40, \u221214, 18 for left and right hemisphere respectively) and the beta values extracted for each subject from the normalized Talairach brain ( ). \n\nThe average TAL coordinates of these ROIs in all our subjects, provided in  , fit very well with those reported in previous studies.   shows the results of the contrast between egomotion-consistent (EC) vs. inconsistent (EI) optic flow and the resulting ROIs in one typical participant. \n  \nRegion of Interest (ROI) comparison with previous studies. For posterior insular cortex (PIC), we provide the coordinates of the anterior (ant.) and posterior (post.) part of the region as reported by Frank et al. ( ). \n    \nImages from the brain of one participant showing the key results. (Top-center patches) Egomotion-consistent (EC) and egomotion-inconsistent (EI) optic flow patterns used as localizers stimuli.   (A)   Contrast between the cortical responses recorded during the egomotion consistent (EC) vs. inconsistent (EI) optic flow conditions. Data are shown on inflated cortical surfaces and flat maps for the left and right hemispheres (  p   < 0.001, uncorrected). The positions of the parieto-occipital sulcus (POS) and cingulate sulcus (CS) are provided as anatomical landmarks. Colored circles outline the five Regions of Interest (ROIs) in this subject.   (B)   Responses during the galvanic stimulation (GVS) experiment for the same participant. Voxels whose activations were stronger during GVS conditions than during baseline were colored in blue (antero-posterior, AP), red (lateral, lat) and cyan (both) before being superimposed transparently on the inflated brain and flat maps. \n  \n\n##### General Linear Model (GLM) \n  \nAll our analyses of the functional data used a general linear model (GLM). The data from each participant were analyzed separately. Time series were processed by fitting a regressor formed by convolving the event time course with a standard hemodynamic response function. As GVS induced micro-movements of the participant\u2019s head could potentially bias our results, six regressors taken from the head motion correction were also included as regressors of no interest. The responses to our first and second conditions (i.e., the stimulations that elicited a vestibular activation consistent with a forward or a backward motion) were modeled together to form the responses to antero-posterior (AP) stimulations. The responses to our third and fourth conditions (i.e., the stimulations consistent with a leftward or a rightward motion) were also modeled together to form the responses to lateral (lat) stimulations. Finally, the beta values obtained for these two conditions and the sham stimulation were corrected by subtracting the beta values obtained during the baseline condition. Then, we looked at the results at the individual level. Our analysis focuses on ROIs that were specifically involved in the processing of EC optic flow to check whether they also had specific responses to AP or Lat galvanic stimulations. However, we also completed this approach with a preliminary whole-brain analysis that was performed at the individual level. In this case, activations were first displayed as an overlay of a segmented and inflated or flattened representation of each hemisphere based on the average anatomical scan of each subject. Activation maps were thresholded at   p   < 0.001 (uncorrected). This initial whole-brain analysis aimed to obtain a general overview of our data and thereby to avoid pinhole conclusions (see Hup\u00e9,  ). \n\n\n##### Connectivity Analyses \n  \nTo characterize functional connectivity between our ROIs during our two conditions, we performed a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis (Friston et al.,  ). This analysis aims at characterizing task or context-specific changes in the relationship between brain areas (see e.g., O\u2019Reilly et al.,   for a review). In our specific case, it permitted to establish those cortical areas that are specifically more connected during the AP and Lat stimulations. PPI can be obtained with a GLM that contains three regressors: the psychological variable (in our case antero-posterior/lateral, coded as +1/\u22121), the physiological variable (the time-course of a seed region) and the PPI regressor (psychological \u00d7 physiological regressor). Before computing the interaction term, the psychological and physiological time courses were both expressed in terms of the underlying neural activity. To do so, we first estimated the hemodynamic response function and then used it to deconvolve the activity recorded from the seed ROI (Gitelman et al.,  ). The two time-courses (psychological and physiological) were also included in the GLM as covariates of no interest. This means that the variance explained by the interaction term is only that over and above what is explained by the main effects of task and physiological correlation. We constructed one GLM for each of our ROIs. The seed time-course associated with an ROI first corresponded to the average response of the ROI across its voxels. It was then mean-corrected and z-transformed. The psychological variables were the AP GVS condition vs. baseline on the one hand and the Lat condition vs. baseline on the other hand. The PPI predictor of a given seed region was then tested in each of the remaining network nodes in a multisubject RFX GLM (points 3\u20135, covering the peak of the BOLD response). \n\nTo focus our analysis on the connections within our functionally defined ROIs, we performed a multiregional PPI approach (Cocchi et al.,  ; Schindler and Bartels,  ). Multiregional PPI is a simple generalization of the PPI approach; it permitted to characterize connectivity between each pair of our functionally defined ROIs (10 pairs in total) rather than between a single-seed region and all the other brain voxels. This analysis was performed at the single-subject level, which helps reduce the uncertainty of the same sample size for PPI analysis. This procedure gives quite robust outcomes since a pair is considered as significant only when it appears as such in the majority of tested subjects. We, therefore, performed nine analyses corresponding to the nine subjects for whom we were able to identify all the ROIs. The PPI predictor of a given ROI was then tested in each of the remaining network nodes in an   ROI-paired   multisubject RFX GLM (points 3\u20135, covering the peak of the BOLD response). \n\n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Results \n  \nWe analyzed the behavioral responses collected for each subject. Although it is well-established that the galvanic stimulation configuration (monopolar vs. bipolar) has a significant effect on the perceived direction of self-motion in standing and lying subjects (Fitzpatrick et al.,  ; Fitzpatrick and Day,  ; Lepecq et al.,  ; St George et al.,  ; Ferr\u00e8 et al.,  ; Aoyama et al.,  ), we did not necessarily expect to elicit clear sensations in our experiment because of the short stimulation duration and low intensity used in our design (see the \u201cGalvanic Stimulation\u201d section). At the group-level, we did not find significant differences between the behavioral responses to our AP and Lat conditions (paired   t  -test   t   = 0.16,   p   = 0.87). Nonetheless, at the individual level, we found that seven of the 13 subjects were able to significantly discriminate between the AP and Lat conditions ( ). \n\n\n### Whole Brain Analysis \n  \nAs an initial step, we computed for each subject the activation maps during the galvanic stimulation (GVS) conditions using a whole-brain analysis. This enables us to obtain an overview of the data at the individual level and also to compare the maps across subjects. However, bear in mind that our analysis (at both the individual and the group level) is performed within our functionally defined ROI [see the \u201cGeneral Linear Model (GLM)\u201d section of the \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d and the next section]. For this initial step, we contrasted both the antero-posterior (AP) and lateral (lat) GVS conditions against the baseline. These contrasts for one typical participant are shown in   (  p   < 0.001, uncorrected). For a direct comparison between visual and vestibular responses,   also shows a response to optic flow in the same participant. \n\nThe responses to lateral GVS (in red) are in good agreement with previous imaging studies that used similar GVS conditions (Bucher et al.,  ; Lobel et al.,  ; Bense et al.,  ). The activity was seen in the PIVC and in putative vestibular areas 2v and 3aNv. Consistently with the previous work of Smith et al. ( ; see their Figure 2), we also found activations in visual areas such as the hMT+ complex or CSv, a portion of the cingulate sulcus that is highly activated during the presentation of egomotion-compatible optic flow\u2014see e.g., Wall and Smith ( ), or Smith et al. ( ). Responses in the other participants were very consistent with those observed here. \n\nAcross subjects and hemispheres, responses to antero-posterior GVS stimulation were generally similar to those observed during lateral GVS stimulation. However, the former condition led to stronger responses in several cortical regions. One is located within the posterior part of the POS. Another lies within intra-parietal sulcus, close to its intersection with post-central sulcus. These two regions overlap with our functionally defined ROIs V6 and VIP (see  , the pink and cyan circles). Outside our visual ROIs, we did not find any region that was consistently (i.e., across subjects and hemispheres) more activated by one of our two GVS conditions. \n\n\n### Activations During Sham Stimulation \n  \nTo confirm that the sham condition is a valid control for GVS somatosensory side effects, a group analysis (  n   = 13) of cortical activations during sham stimulation was performed ( ). Three clusters are observed in each hemisphere. Bilateral activation was found in V1 (Talairach space, \u22123, \u221275, 13 and 5, \u221273, 11 for left and right hemisphere, respectively) and fusiform gyrus (Talairach space, \u221227, \u221263, \u22127 and 26, \u221260, \u22129 for left and right hemisphere, respectively). Also, significant activation was found in the left primary somatosensory cortex (Talairach space, \u221256, \u221215, 13) and right middle occipital gyrus (Talairach space, 29, \u221277, 18) an area that has been involved in multisensory integration (Doehrmann et al.,  ; Renier et al.,  ). Interestingly, no significant activations were found in any of the ROIs used in this study. \n\n\n### Regions of Interest Analysis \n  \nWe ran an ROI-based analysis to enable the comparisons between the responses from our different subjects (see the \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d section). Within all the ROIs (in both hemispheres) of our subjects, we computed the beta values corresponding to the AP GVS, Lat GVS, and the sham condition. These beta values were then corrected by subtracting the beta values of the baseline condition [see the \u201cGeneral Linear Model (GLM)\u201d section].   shows the results in all our ROIs (i.e., V6, VIP, CSv, hMT+, and PIC). \n  \nAverage beta values obtained in our different ROIs during the antero-posterior (blue) and lateral (red) GVS conditions. Values corresponding to the sham condition are provided in white. The error bars give the standard errors. The # symbols are here to remind that in some subjects, the ventral intraparietal (VIP) and posterior insular cortex (PIC) ROIs were only defined in one hemisphere (see details in the text). We report here the significant differences between AP and Lat conditions (  post hoc   t  -test, ***  p   < 0.001, *  p   < 0.05). The results of the other statistical comparisons are reported in the main document. \n  \nResponses in V6 were strongly dependent on the condition (rmANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected:   F   = 32.02,   p   < 0.001,   \u03b7   = 2.81;  ,  ).   Post hoc   t  -tests confirmed that the beta values were significantly higher for the AP GVS condition (  t   = 6.99,   p   <0.0001 when compared to the Lat condition and   t   = 7.72,   p   < 0.0001 when compared to the   sham   condition). We did not find any significant differences between the Lat condition and the   sham   condition (  t   = 0.046,   p   = 0.964). Responses were also strongly influenced by the condition in area VIP (rmANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected:   F   = 5.52,   p   = 0.016,   \u03b7   = 0.512). In this ROI as well,   post hoc   t  -tests showed that responses in the AP GVS condition were stronger than in the Lat condition (  t   = 4.252,   p   < 0.05). We did not find any significant differences between the Lat condition and the   sham   condition (  t   = 0.667,   p   = 0.521). Therefore, both areas V6 and VIP had specific responses during the antero-posterior GVS. \n  \nPaired   t  -test results, contrasting beta-values obtained in antero-posterior (AP), lateral (LAT), and sham condition, for our five Regions of Interest (ROIs), by taking all (100%) voxels, and the 80% and 60% closest to the central coordinates. \n  \nResponses in area CSv and hMT+ were both strongly modulated by condition (rmANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected:   F   = 3.253,   p   < 0.001,   \u03b7   = 3.59 in CSv and   F   = 4.522,   p   < 0.05,   \u03b7   = 1.429 in hMT+). In these ROIs, both the AP (  t   = 4.22,   p   < 0.01 in CSv and   t   = 2.83,   p   = 0.05 in hMT+) and Lat (  t   = 4.24,   p   < 0.01 in CSv and   t   = 3.91,   p   = 0.05 in hMT+) GVS conditions had stronger responses than the sham condition. This time, we did not find any significant difference between the two GVS conditions (  t   = 1.03,   p   = 0.91 in CSv and   t   = \u22120.145,   p   = 0.887 in hMT+). \n\nFinally, responses in PIC were also dependent on the condition (rmANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected:   F   = 55.55,   p   < 0.001,   \u03b7   = 1.579). In this case,   post hoc   t  -tests confirmed that responses were stronger during the Lat GVS condition than during the AP GVS condition (  t   = \u22122.41,   p   < 0.05). Responses during the AP and Lat conditions were stronger than during the   sham   condition (  t   = 4.193,   p   < 0.01 and   t   = 6.86,   p   < 0.001, respectively). As stated in the \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d section, we looked for activation in an additional ROI, PIVC, defined from former studies (Frank et al.,  ), to compare with PIC ( ). Given that the results are noisy, probably due to the ROI definition procedure, a one-sample   t  -test against 0 showed significant values for antero-posterior (AP):   t   = 2.68,   p   = 0.02 and for lateral (Lat):   t   = 2.47,   p   = 0.03 but not for Sham condition (Sham):   t   = 0.57,   p   = 0.58. \n\nAmong all our ROIs, CSv had the strongest responses to GVS conditions. This result is consistent with those reported in Smith et al. ( ). Overall, our results demonstrate that the activations elicited by Lat GVS in areas V6, VIP, CSv, hMT+, and PIC are reliable across different stimulation parameters (a 1 Hz sinewave alternating between \u00b13 mA in Smith et al.,   vs. a 1 mA step in the present study). \n\nWe observed in the \u201cRegion of Interest (ROI) Definition\u201d section that our procedure to define area V6, which did not include wide-field retinotopic mapping, cannot guarantee that this ROI does not include small portions from adjacent areas in some subjects. To make sure that the effects reported here reflect properties of area V6, we performed a control analysis where we reproduced our statistics on subsamples of voxels within this ROI. We first computed the Euclidean distances between all the voxels within the ROI and the ROI center. We then defined two smaller ROIs that grouped either the 80 or the 60% of voxels that were the closest to the central coordinates. These smaller ROIs have less chance to contain voxels that do not belong to V6. As the ROI centers were not strictly identical for all the subjects, this process could exclude the subject for whom the cluster was outside from the reduced ROI, explaining why the number of subjects slightly decreases from 100% to 80 and 60%. \n\nThe results of this analysis are shown in   and   reports all the paired   t  -test contrasts between the GVS conditions, for our five ROIs. \n  \nControl to characterize the influence of the ROI spatial extents on the results. These analyses were performed for V6, cingulate sulcus visual (CSv), hMT+, VIP, and PIC (from top to bottom).

(C)   Idem for the 60% closest voxels. \n  \nWe can observe that our main results ( ,  ) remained unchanged with this analysis. It demonstrates that the preference for AP GVS stimulation that we found in V6 is robust to variation in the spatial extent used to define this area and, therefore, not driven by activity within adjacent functional areas. We used the same approach to double-check our results in the VIP, CSv, hMT+, and PIC ROIs. Indeed, these areas were defined from thresholded contrast maps (  p   < 0.001, uncorrected, see the \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d section), which is always subject to uncertainty, see e.g., Eickhoff et al. ( ). This control analysis confirmed our results in areas CSv, hMT+, and VIP. In particular, for area VIP, it demonstrated that the preference for AP GVS did not depend on the spatial extent used to define this ROI. Interestingly, our control confirmed that responses in PIC during Lat GVS were stronger than during AP GVS only for the 80% of voxels but not for the 60% (  t   = 2.705,   p   = 0.024 and   t   = 0.187,   p   = 0.856, respectively). This result should, therefore, be taken with care and will probably necessitate further investigations. \n\n\n### Connectivity Analysis \n  \nThe differential activation within our visual ROIs during antero-posterior (AP) and lateral (lat) conditions support the hypothesis that antero-posterior and lateral vestibular signals are processed by distinct cortical networks. Nevertheless, it does not provide any information regarding interactions between these areas and the structure of these networks. To identify the connectivity pattern between our functionally defined ROIs, we ran a   multiregional PPI   analysis (see the \u201cConnectivity Analysis\u201d section). For this type of analysis, all ROIs must be defined in each subject. It was, therefore, only performed on the nine subjects for whom all the ROIs were defined. If V6 and VIP are more activated during the AP compatible condition, one could expect that connectivity between each of these ROIs and the others are more pronounced during this condition.   shows connections between our ROIs that are significantly more correlated during the lat condition than during baseline.   shows these correlations for the AP condition. \n  \nPsychophysiological interaction (PPI) functional connectivity analysis. Multiregional PPI was run across the five ROIs identified in the localizer protocol. Results are shown for the Lat   (A)   and AP   (B)   GVS conditions. A solid line between two ROIs corresponds to a connection that is significantly stronger during this condition (  P   < 0.001) than during baseline. \n  \nDuring Lat GVS, areas PIC, hMT+, CSv, and VIP were more connected than during baseline (5-A). This was particularly true for area PIC. The connectivity pattern between V6 and the other ROIs remained at the baseline level for this condition. At the opposite, during AP GVS, V6 was significantly more connected to CSv, hMT+, and PIC (5-B) than during baseline (  P   < 0.001). Area VIP was also significantly more connected to hMT+ during this condition (  P   < 0.001), whereas it was not the case during the Lat condition. \n\nTo determine if cortical activations were different in the subjects who detected the GVS direction over chance, we looked for a correlation between behavior outcome (d\u2019 sensitivity) and brain activity. We did not find any significant relationship between our fMRI measurements and our subject\u2019s perceptual reports. This was true for both the beta values of each region and the connectivity strengths (and amount of connected pairs). Given the low intensity used in our design, and above all the too short stimulation duration to allow the building of conscious vection, it is possible that the elicited percept was not strong enough or that the limited amount of subjects does not allow to uncover a small effect to establish such correlations. \n\n\n### Control for Vergence \n  \nOur results showed that areas V6 and VIP are only activated during antero-posterior GVS. One possibility is that, even if our participants had their eyes closed, this condition triggered convergence or divergence eye movement and these movements affected the activity in V6 and/or VIP. For example, a study by Quinlan and Culham ( ) showed that responses in the dorsal POS (dPOS, a brain portion that includes V6) were modulated by the vergence angle. To control that GVS (and specifically the stimulations associated with a backward or forward motion of the body) did not trigger convergence and/or divergence movement of the two eyes, we performed a control experiment outside of the scanner. For this control, subjects had their eyes opened and binocularly viewed Nonius lines (see Cottereau et al.,  ) through anaglyph goggles with red/green filter on the left/right eye. The green line was displayed in the upper part of the visual field and was only seen by the right eye (through the green filter). The red line was displayed in the bottom part of the visual field and was only seen by the left eye (through the red filter). The two lines were vertically aligned with a visible fixation point at the center of the screen. When binocularly viewed through the anaglyph goggles, this configuration appeared as two white lines vertically aligned with a white dot on the center of the screen. The subject task was to fixate the point during blocks of GVS that were identical to those used in our main experiment (see the \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d section). After each stimulation, subjects had to report if they perceived the two lines as \u201caligned\u201d during GVS (upper arrow of the keyboard) or if the upper line moved to the left (left arrow) or the right (right arrow) relatively to the bottom line. These last two cases, respectively, correspond to convergence and divergence eye movements. The sensitivity to Nonius misalignment is typically below 2 arcmin (McKee and Levi,  ), which is more accurate than what can be obtained from a binocular eye tracker. Five subjects who participated in the galvanic stimulation experiment performed 20 trials of each condition. Their perceptual reports are provided in  . \n  \nPerceptual reports during the control experiment for vergence (  n   = 5). The proportion of \u201cleft,\u201d \u201caligned\u201d and \u201cright\u201d answers are provided for both the antero-posterior (AP) and lateral (Lat) conditions. The \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d reports respectively correspond to convergence and divergence eye movements (see details in the text). The error bars give the standard errors. \n  \nThese results demonstrate that: (1) GVS had a minor impact on binocular eye movements; and (2) the small proportions of reported convergence/divergence movements were not statistically different between our AP and Lat GVS conditions. We conclude that the activations elicited by our AP condition in V6 were not caused by eye movements. \n\nEven though our subjects had their eyes closed during the fMRI recordings, we cannot exclude that their lateral eye movements were different between our two conditions. If it is a limitation of our study, we are confident that our results are not contaminated by lateral eye movements. Indeed, our analyses were performed in functional ROIs that are not specifically known to respond to lateral eye movements. Also, our whole-brain analysis did not reveal any significant activation in regions whose responses are modulated by lateral eye movements like for example the frontal eye field. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study aimed to characterize the cortical networks that are activated during antero-posterior (AP) and lateral (Lat) GVS using fMRI measurements. A previous neuroimaging study employed the usual binaural bipolar mode, where the anode is placed on one mastoid process and the cathode on the other to identify visual cortical areas that receive vestibular inputs (Smith et al.,  ). In the present study, we applied lateral GVS using an opposite double monaural configuration (see  ) that was found to induce equivalent postural response than binaural bipolar (S\u00e9verac Cauquil et al.,  ). Recent electrophysiology studies using GVS on macaque monkeys showed that anodal and cathodal have the opposite effect on vestibular afferents discharge of both otolith and semicircular canals (Kwan et al.,  ). This corroborates the assumption that the orientation of the response to GVS is a function of the imbalance between right and left vestibular polarization (S\u00e9verac Cauquil et al.,  ). Here, we replicated Smith\u2019s results obtained from 3 mA sinusoidal binaural bipolar stimulation using a 1 mA step pulse in opposite double monaural GVS, validating the robustness of the GVS approach. However, such lateral GVS configurations activate the parts of the vestibular apparatus that are sensitive to roll tilt, in the frontal plane (Day et al.,  ; S\u00e9verac Cauquil et al.,  ; Fitzpatrick and Day,  ). Therefore, this design prohibits the study of the consequences of an antero-posterior stimulation, although these signals are the most prominent during locomotion, which constitutes a major component of egomotion. We, therefore, used binaural monopolar GVS to investigate the cortical responses specific to antero-posterior mechanisms. This design, with electrodes of the same polarity placed over the mastoid processes, and of opposite polarity on the forehead orientates the galvanic-evoked vestibular input along the antero-posterior axis (S\u00e9verac Cauquil et al.,  ,  ; Magnusson et al.,  ; Aoyama et al.,  ; see  ). This permitted us to distinguish the contribution of AP signals from the Lat ones provided by the usual, binaural bipolar mode. Our behavioral analysis supports those previously reported results. Even though our subjects were lying in the scanner, 7 over 13 were still able to discriminate over chance the stimulated direction of self-motion. Regarding the low intensity (1 mA vs. 3 mA in Aoyama et al.,  ) and short duration (2 s vs. 5 s in report Fitzpatrick et al.,  ) and taking into account the fact that here we submitted our subjects to a discrimination and not a detection task, we are entitled to consider we achieved to stimulate in two different directions our subjects\u2019 vestibular apparatuses. \n\nAs a preliminary step, we performed for each subject a whole-brain analysis to get a general overview of our data. Across the subject, our two GVS conditions led to strong fMRI activations within lateral sulcus, in the PIVC. This, corroborated by the introduction of PIVC as a supplementary ROI based on published coordinates, is in agreement with previous studies that found significant activations in the same region (Bucher et al.,  ; Lobel et al.,  ; Bense et al.,  ; Stephan et al.,  ) and with a recent hypothesis suggesting that PIVC is a complex that contains visual and non-visual areas specialized in different functions (Frank and Greenlee,  ). However, we were mostly interested in responses within functionally defined ROIs that are activated by egomotion-consistent optic flow: V6, VIP, CSv, hMT+, and PIC (see Cardin and Smith,  ;  ). Our aim was to better understand how these visual ROIs process vestibular inputs and hence their possible implication in multisensory integration during forward locomotion. \n\nWe found that area PIC was significantly activated during both our two GVS conditions ( ). This result is in agreement with a previous multisensory study (Frank et al.,  ). Our connectivity analysis showed that PIC is the most connected area during galvanic stimulation ( ). This area possibly works as a hub where multisensory signals are integrated during egomotion. This strong selectivity to both visual and vestibular modalities supports the idea that PIC is the human homolog of macaque visual posterior Sylvian area (VPS; Chen et al.,  ). This is in total agreement with previous single-unit recordings and tracer studies in non-human primates (Guldin and Gr\u00fcsser,  ). In the macaque, this portion of cortex receives inputs from all the cortical areas of the vestibular system and also, even more, relevant for our study, its neurons are sensitive to both somatosensory and visual signals, in particular to optokinetic stimulation from wide (i.e., >30\u00b0) structured patterns (Gr\u00fcsser et al.,  ). Even though defined from former studies (Frank et al.,  ) rather than localizers, we had a look at PIVC activation which is noisier, probably due to the definition procedure, not different between Lat and AP, and twice as smaller as PIC ( ). \n\nA major finding of this study is that area V6 is only activated during antero-posterior GVS ( ). Using lateral GVS, a previous study (Smith et al.,  ) did not find any activation in V6 and concluded that this area was probably not involved in visuo-vestibular integration. Our results are in agreement with the finding that V6 remains silent during lateral stimulation. However, the strong responses that we obtained during AP GVS show that V6 does receive vestibular input and has probably a specific role during locomotion. This hypothesis is strengthened by our PPI analyses that demonstrated that area V6 becomes significantly more connected to all our other ROIs during AP GVS ( ). A recent study showed that there is another visual region bordering V6: V6A (Pitzalis et al.,  ). This area is mostly responsive to peripheral representation (\u226530\u00b0) and lacks the central part of the visual field. Our optic flow stimulus spanned a square of 16\u00b0 \u00d7 16\u00b0 and it is, therefore, likely that it activated V6 and not V6A. Future studies should however include a wide field retinotopic mapping in their procedures to delineate these two regions. A previous fMRI study in humans found that responses in the dorsal POS (dPOS, a region that includes V6) were modulated by the vergence angle (Quinlan and Culham,  ). Our control experiment (see the \u201cControl for Vergence\u201d section) ruled out the possibility that our results are affected by vergence. In human, V6 responds to 3D translational egomotion (Sdoia et al.,  ). Its responses to optic flow are also enhanced when the flow is combined with congruent binocular disparity values (Cardin et al.,  ). These observations and our results suggest that V6 might have a specific role during locomotion. In the macaque, V6 is often described as a principally visual area. A tracer study showed that anatomically, it is mostly connected to other visual regions, including areas MST and VIP (Galletti et al.,  ). Its responses are strongly influenced by optic flow signals but are not modulated by inertial motion (Fan et al.,  ). If areas V6 in human and macaque share similar visual properties, like their retinotopic organization (Pitzalis et al.,  ,  ) or their selectivity to optic flow (Cardin and Smith,  ; Fan et al.,  ; but see Cottereau et al.,  ), our results suggest that human V6 has a specific role for processing locomotion consistent vestibular inputs. It is, therefore, possible that the homology between human and macaque V6 is not as pronounced as currently believed (Pitzalis et al.,  ,  ). \n\nOur results also suggest an implication of area VIP in the processing of vestibular inputs. Responses to Lat GVS in this area did not differ from those measured during the sham condition. In their study, Smith et al. ( ) also reported that Lat GVS did not elicit significant responses in this area. However, our PPI estimation demonstrated that connections between VIP and areas CSv and PIC were significantly stronger during Lat GVS than during baseline ( ). The results of this connectivity analysis suggest that area VIP might be implicated in the processing of Lat GVS even though further investigation is needed to better understand its exact role in this condition. VIP responses were significantly stronger during AP GVS ( ) and VIP was also more connected to the other ROIs during this condition (see the additional connection to hMT+ in  ). VIP is, therefore, involved during AP GVS and could be included in a cortical network processing vestibular signals, with a strong preference for the antero-posterior direction. In human, VIP is activated by different depth cues such as egomotion compatible optic flow (Wall and Smith,  ), and disparity (Yang et al.,  ). This area is the putative homologous of macaque VIP, see e.g., Bremmer et al. ( ), a multisensory area that integrates visual and vestibular inputs (Bremmer et al.,  ; Schlack et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ). In particular, VIP in macaque strongly responds to optic flow (Cottereau et al.,  ) and is supposed to play an important role in navigation in space (Bremmer,  ). Altogether, these results are in line with our findings and suggest that area VIP is important for locomotion in both human and macaque. \n\nSignificant activations were found in both hMT+ and CSv during AP and Lat GVS conditions. For lateral stimulation, our results are consistent with those of Smith et al. ( ). This study found that CSv had the strongest responses to this condition. This is also the case in our results (see  ). Smith et al. ( ) also found that MST but not MT was activated during lateral GVS. In our study, we did not perform the localizers that permit to dissociate between MT and MST and we, therefore, only localized the human middle temporal complex (i.e., hMT+) using a functional localizer based on optic flow (see the \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d section). The hMT+ complex includes both MT and MST, and might also contain other regions such as the putative homologs of macaque areas FST and V4t (see Kolster et al.,  ). In our data, we did not find any significant difference between the responses to AP vs. Lat GVS in both CSv and hMT+. This suggests that the global responses of these areas are equivalent to our two GVS conditions. Note, however, that this does not rule out the possibility that subregions within CSv and/or hMT+ are selective to either one or the other condition. This distinction remains difficult to make at the macroscopic level of fMRI recordings and will need further investigations. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nEthics committee that approved the study: Comit\u00e9 de Protection des Personnes Sud Ouest et Outre Mer II (CPPSOOM II).

The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, including the pre-Supplementary Motor Area (pre-SMA), has been implicated in the internally generated aspects of action planning, such as choice and intention. Yet, the mechanism by which this area interacts with other cognitive brain regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a central node in decision-making, is still unclear. To shed light on this mechanism, brain activity was measured via fMRI and intracranial EEG in two studies during the performance of visually cued repeated finger tapping in which the choice of finger was guided by either a presented number (external) or self-choice (internal). A functional-MRI (fMRI) study in 15 healthy participants demonstrated that the pre-SMA, compared to the SMA proper, was more active and also more functionally correlated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during internally compared to externally guided action planning (  p   < 0.05, random effect). In a similar manner, an intracranial-EEG study in five epilepsy patients showed greater inter-regional gamma-related connectivity between electrodes situated in medial and lateral aspects of the prefrontal cortex for internally compared to externally guided actions. Although this finding was observed for groups of electrodes situated both in the pre-SMA and SMA-proper, increased intra-cluster gamma-related connectivity was only observed for the pre-SMA (sign-test,   p   < 0.0001). Overall our findings provide multi-scale indications for the involvement of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and especially the pre-SMA, in generating internally guided motor planning. Our intracranial-EEG results further point to enhanced functional connectivity between decision-making- and motor planning aspects of the PFC, as a possible neural mechanism for internally generated action planning. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIn everyday life, our actions are guided by either external sources, for example typing a dictated sentence, or internal sources, for example typing a sentence generated in one's head. Although in both instances the sequence of motor actions involved in writing remains the same, there is a fundamental difference between the planning processes of these actions. While externally guided action planning (EGAP) complies with environmental demands and usually includes adaptation to circumstances, internally guided action planning (IGAP) fulfills one's own choice and relies more on self initiation (Prinz,  ). The relatedness of these planning modes is illustrated in pathological states such as Parkinson's disease, where difficulty in initiating an internally driven action can be overcome by an externally guided sensory cue (Glickstein and Stein,  ). \n\nStudying the neural correlates of IGAP is not trivial as its mental occurrence is covert, therefore, making reliable experimental probing difficult. Nevertheless, it was shown in monkeys that lesions in the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA), a dorsal aspect of the Medial Prefrontal Cortex (MPFC), resulted in inability to select appropriate movements without the guidance of an external cue (Halsband and Passingham,  ; Chen et al.,  ). Functional-MRI (fMRI) studies in humans have provided further evidence for an anterior-posterior functional subdivision within the DMPFC, showing that the pre-SMA compared to the SMA proper, is more involved in IGAP than EGAP (Halsband et al.,  ; Deiber et al.,  ; Jenkins et al.,  ; Crosson et al.,  ; Debaere et al.,  ; Tremblay and Gracco,  ; Mueller et al.,  ). \n\nIt is yet unclear whether the SMA subregions interact differently with other brain regions to generate actions, and which mechanism governs such communication. Based on anatomical studies in monkeys (Luppino et al.,  ), as well as Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) study in humans (Johansen-Berg et al.,  ), the pre-SMA, but not the SMA proper, was shown to have anatomical connections with the DLPFC, an area involved in executive functions including decision-making. In accordance, in a resting-state fMRI study, it was shown that the pre-SMA is more functionally connected with cognitive aspects of the lateral-PFC (such as the superior and inferior frontal gyri), while the SMA proper is more connected with motor aspects of the frontal cortex (such as the precentral gyrus) (Kim et al.,  ). Altogether these studies point to a possible mechanism of communication between motor and decision-making related nodes in the generation of human action planning, corresponding to the rostral part of the medial PFC and the lateral PFC, respectively. \n\nIn the current study we examined whether connectivity patterns between motor and decision-making nodes could be probed by manipulating the source of action planning; i.e., internal versus external. Specifically we focused on the choice aspect involved in planning finger tapping, by manipulating the source of guidance for selection of one finger out of a possible three to be either visually presented (i.e., externally guided) or self-decided (internally guided). Framed in terms of information theory, actions emanating from internal guidance have a greater degree of freedom and often rely on past experience, thus requiring more information than those derived from external guidance, and are thus likely to be associated with longer response times (Ratcliff,  ; Brown and Heathcote,  ). We used a simple motor task of repeated finger tapping that overcomes a common confounder related to the link between the complexity and source of action planning. Indeed our paradigm elicited equal response times to actions performed in both IGAP and EGAP conditions. \n\nTo unveil the functional relationship between motor and decision-making aspects of the dorsal PFC we applied both fMRI and Intracranial EEG (iEEG), allowing for high spatial and temporal resolutions of the mapping. By using fMRI we expected to reveal the fine-grained spatial specificity for source of action-planning, with IGAP compared to EGAP evoking greater activation in the pre-SMA than SMA-proper, and enhanced functional connectivity between the pre-SMA and DLPFC. The iEEG study aimed to detect patterns of connectivity between the lateral and medial aspects of the PFC. We used two band indices to detect inter- and intra-region connectivity: phase synchronization and co-activation. We calculated gamma band phase-synchronization as a reflection of distant neuronal communications (Engel and Singer,  ; Fries,  ). In contrast, we evaluated amplitude co-activation which is more related to changes within a local neural population (Tass,  ). \n\nWe specifically focused on gamma activity as it was found to be related to both cognitive and motor tasks. Previously, oscillatory synchronization in the gamma band was thought to reflect a binding mechanism that specifically serves perceptual functions (Singer and Gray,  ; Roelfsema et al.,  ; Tallon-Baudry and Bertrand,  ). More recently, the concept of synchronization in the gamma band has expanded, with evidence that it is related to cognitive tasks including directing attention (Brovelli et al.,  ; Lachaux et al.,  ; Ray et al.,  ), decision-making (Womelsdorf et al.,  ; Donner et al.,  ), and outcome evaluation (Jung et al.,  ). Additionally, synchronized activity in the gamma band was found to be impaired in Parkinson's disease, in which there are difficulties in movement initiation (Cassidy et al.,  ; Fogelson et al.,  ; Trottenberg et al.,  ; Kuhn et al.,  ). Several studies point to a possible mediating role of gamma synchronization between motor related nodes and cognitive nodes. For example, in an EEG study an association between fronto-parietal induced gamma band activity and reaction time was reported (Gonzalez Andino et al.,  ). This finding may suggest that anticipatory gamma band activity reflects a control mechanism mediating the speed of motor responses. In a subsequent MEG study, gamma activity was found to be enhanced both in the primary somatosensory and motor cortices during fast performance compared to slow performance (Tecchio et al.,  ). Based on these studies, we aim to explore how gamma band synchronization is involved in the interaction between motor and decision-making processes, which are both essential for motor planning, and more so to internally generated action. Specifically, using iEEG we expected to unveil a temporal aspect of such connectivity with IGAP evoking gamma synchronization between electrodes situated in the medial and lateral aspects of the PFC. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Study 1: fMRI experiment in healthy participants \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nFifteen healthy right-handed volunteers (seven females; mean age: 26.5, age range: 21\u201338 years) participated in the fMRI experiment. Participants reported no history of psychiatric or neurological disorders, and no current use of any psychoactive medications. One participant was excluded from the final fMRI analysis due to excessive head movements during the scanning. The research protocol was approved by the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center institutional review board (IRB). All participants provided written informed consent before the experiment. \n\n\n#### Finger tapping paradigm \n  \nParticipants were visually instructed to perform sequences of three button presses with each hand separately using a response box, as illustrated in Figure  . In the EGAP condition, the presented stimulus comprised of a sequence of displayed images, each containing three identical digits (e.g., 1, 1, 1 or 2, 2, 2) instructing the participants which finger to tap. In the IGAP condition, participants were presented with three identical non-numeric symbols to which they were instructed to tap three times using the same finger. In this condition, participants were explicitly told to respond as randomly and as variably as possible, avoiding using the same finger in each trial of the internally guided condition. \n  \n Finger tapping paradigm.   Participants were instructed to tap a finger three times according to the visual stimuli: in the externally guided condition they selected a finger according to the number presented, while in the internally guided condition they had free choice of which finger to tap in each trial. \n  \nThe paradigm was part of a larger study which additionally attempted to differentiate between complexity levels, however, as the current study included data of patients undergoing iEEG, we will focus only on the simple conditions in this paper. The additional two conditions that were also included in the paradigm were either sequences of three different numbers (e.g., 1,2,3 or 2,3,2) cuing for tapping via 2 or 3 different fingers, or three different non-numerical symbols. \n\nThere were a total of four blocks for each of the two conditions; i.e., IGAP and EGAP. Each block started with an instruction regarding the hand that should be active for the entire block, followed by presentation of six stimuli belonging to one of the experimental conditions, with a display of either three numbers or symbols, lasting for 2 s followed by 1 s of dot-fixation. Participants were instructed to tap immediately on seeing the image. The task blocks were separated by 15 rest blocks of 12 or 18 s. The entire session lasted 369 s and was performed twice by participants in counterbalanced order. Stimuli delivery and response acquisition were controlled using Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems). Stimuli were projected with an LCD projector (NEC, VT660K) onto a screen positioned in front of the participant's forehead and viewed through a tilted mirror. Responses were gathered with an MRI-compatible response box (HH-1 \u00d7 4L, Current Designs). The finger tapping behavioral data of response time and accuracy was analyzed using STATISTICA data analysis software [StatSoft, Inc. (2001), version 6]. \n\n\n#### fMRI acquisition procedure \n  \nImaging was performed on a GE 3T Signa Horizon echo speed scanner with a resonant gradient echoplanar imaging system. Functional images were acquired using a single-shot echo-planar T2 -weighted sequence. The following parameters were used: 96 \u00d7 96 matrix; field of view of 20 \u00d7 20 cm; 40 slices with 3 mm thickness and no gap. TR=3000 ms, TE=35 ms; flip angle 90\u00b0, acquisition orientation was of the AC-PC plane. In addition, each functional scan was accompanied by a three-dimensional (3D) anatomical scan using T1-SPGR sequence (1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm). \n\n\n#### fMRI analysis \n  \nBrainVoyager QX version 2.1 (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands) was used to analyze the recorded fMRI data (Goebel et al.,  ). The first six functional volumes, before signal stabilization, were excluded from analysis. Preprocessing included the following operations: 3D motion correction using trilinear interpolation, linear trend removal and high-pass filtering. A 4 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian smoothing was used to overcome differences in inter-subject localization. Functional 2D data were manually aligned and coregistered with 3D anatomical data which were normalized into Talairach space. To account for a hemodynamic response, predictors were convolved with standard hemodynamic response filter for all participants. Whole brain analysis was performed using voxel-based general linear model (GLM) in which the various activation blocks were defined as district predictors. \n\n  Verification of pre-SMA selectivity for IGAP.    At a second level analysis, a random-effect GLM was applied on the individual parameter estimates obtained from the first-level analysis. Direct contrast between IGAP and EGAP was applied in order to validate selective pre-SMA activation for IGAP. In addition, we analyzed this activation change in three regions of interest: SMA-proper, pre-SMA, and DLPFC. These regions were defined functionally as a box-shaped volume of 11 voxels diameter around the peak of activation in all conditions vs. rest contrast. The sub-regions within the SMA were defined according to commonly used markers of AC-PC and its vertical plane through AC (VCA) (Zilles et al.,  ). Hence, the SMA proper box was bordered anteriorly by the VCA line, medially by the midline, and inferiorly by the cingulate gyrus. The pre-SMA was bordered posteriorly by the VCA line, medially by the midline, and inferiorly by the cingulate gyrus. For the DLPFC, the box included the bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG) that corresponds to Brodmann area 9. Beta weights were extracted for each of the conditions from each region and submitted to a summary statistical analysis of average and mean. \n\n  Functional connectivity analysis.    Whole brain functional connectivity analysis was performed using BrainVoyager Granger Causality Mapping (GCM) toolbox (Goebel et al.,  ). The reference seed regions for this analysis were the bilateral pre-SMA and SMA proper. These regions included a margin of nine voxels diameter around the peak of activation. We applied this analysis separately for the IGAP and EGAP conditions performed by the dominant right hand, to describe the functional network for each condition. Contrasts between the resulting whole brain maps were performed via BV using a random effect GLM analysis. Statistical significance thresholds for the functional connectivity maps were computed by bootstrapping and applying a conservative false discovery rate (FDR) with a significance threshold of   p   < 0.05 for a multiple comparison correction. \n\n\n\n### Study 2: fMRI/iEEG experiment in patients with epilepsy \n  \n#### Patients \n  \nFive patients with epilepsy (three females; mean age: 25, S.D: 9.48) participated in the iEEG experiment. Patients were recruited from the neurosurgery department at the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center following clinical referral for subdural electrode implantation as part of their pre-surgical evaluation (Dewar et al.,  ). Each patient had a grid and/or strips of electrodes covering the medial and lateral PFC to varying extent. \n\nAs part of their pre-surgical evaluation, all patients underwent a standard neuropsychological assessment, which included the Hebrew version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence and Memory Scales (WAIS-III) (Corporation,  ). The 12-year-old patient completed the children's intelligence scale (see Table   for patients' demographics). The research protocol was approved by the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center IRB. All participants provided written informed consent before the experiment. \n  \n Patients demographics and performance during pre-operative neuropsychological assesment  . \n    \n  iEEG experiment.    Experiments were conducted on the ward, using a laptop placed in front of the patient sitting in the bed. The finger tapping paradigm was slightly modified for the iEEG experiment consisting of the same conditions; though, each trial was presented for 4 s instead of 3 s (Figure  ). This adjustment was made to enable longer response time for the patients. Overall, each patient performed the paradigm twice, with a total of 48 trials for each of the conditions using only the hand contralateral to the main side of implanted electrodes. To allow for exact timing between the stimulus onset and iEEG recordings, triggers were recorded along with the stimuli. Sampling rate of the EEG was of 200 Hz. The effect of an epileptic attack was minimized by maintaining at least a 3 h interval between a recorded epileptic attack and the experiment. In addition, electrodes which showed local activity during epileptic seizures were excluded. \n\n\n#### iEEG data acquistion and analysis \n  \n##### A. electrode localization. \n  \n Electrode implantation  . The electrodes (Adtech, Racine, WI), arranged in one-dimensional strips or 2-dimensional grids, were of 2 mm diameter, separated by an 8 mm gap (Figure  ). A total of 281 electrodes were recorded. The locations of electrodes varied between patients and were based solely on clinical considerations. Inclusion in the study was based on presence of electrodes in the medial as well as lateral aspects of the prefrontal cortex. Monopolar recordings referenced to an extra-cranial electrode were used. \n  \n iEEG analysis. (A)   Electrode localization. After implantation of electrodes, CT scan was performed to verify electrode location, and was coregistered with pre-operative MRI T1-SPGR images. Data was then evaluated for visual response in posterior temporal electrodes, an example is shown of ERPs response from one patient (#2)   (B1)  . Motor Mu de-synchronization response in the primary motor area is shown using brain power plot maps averaged across all patients   (B2)  . Mean time frequency analysis was used to select the band of gamma frequency   (B3)  .   (C)   Illustration of the steps included in the iEEG co-activation analysis. \n  \n CT-MRI coregistration  . In order to determine the location of electrodes, for each patient, a post-implantation computed tomographic (CT) scan was coregistered with preoperative T1-SPGR MRI scan. This was done using BrainVoyager software 1.10.4 (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, Netherlands). Localization was additionally constrained by the requirement of location on the cortical surface. This was performed manually in order to overcome brain shift following electrode implantation (Hermes et al.,  ). The three-dimensional brain image including the electrode locations was rendered as a surface mesh, enabling precise localization of the electrodes with relation to the subject's anatomical MRI. In addition, images were normalized to Talairach coordinates enabling the localization of all the electrodes in standard coordinate space. For joint presentation of all subjects' electrodes, electrode locations were projected onto a cortical reconstruction of a specific healthy subject (Figure  ). \n\n Electrode selection  . The electrodes for each of the regions were selected based on their anatomical location: the DMPFC included electrodes in the medial wall that were bordered posteriorly by the primary motor area, laterally by the MFG and inferiorly by the cingulate gyrus. Electrodes in this area were divided into the pre-SMA and the SMA proper based on the VCA line definition which was previously described. The LPFC included electrodes in the middle and inferior frontal gyri that were bordered posteriorly by the primary motor area, medially by the superior frontal gyrus and inferiorly by the lateral sulcus. A total of 34 and 33 electrodes were selected for the LPFC and for the DMPFC, respectively (see details in Table  ). Figure   demonstrates electrode locations in relation to the predefined boundaries as derived from CT scans and superimposed on anatomical reconstructed SPGR sequence. \n  \n Details of epilepsy type and electrode location  . \n  \nThe iEEG analysis was performed using in-house software developed with MATLAB (The MathWorks., Natick, MA) and the public license EEGLAB toolbox (Delorme and Makeig,  ) in two steps: first, data was validated and then functional multivariate analyses were performed. \n\n\n##### B. data evaluation. \n  \nFirst, in order to determine the quality of the EEG signal, event-related potentials (ERPs) were calculated starting from the stimulus onset, with a window of two seconds. Figure   presents representative ERPs obtained from one electrode for one patient pointing to significant inflection peaks around 170 and 250 ms as expected (Schendan and Lucia,  ). Using EEGLAB toolbox, peaks significantly different from 0 were marked in red based on a two-tailed   t  -test at each time point.   P   value was set to   p   < 0.05 for this test (Figure  ). \n\nIn addition, we examined the alpha motor activation to verify Mu rhythm (de)synchronization in relation to motor response in the primary motor area (Pfurtscheller and Neuper,  ; Pineda,  ; Miller,  ). Frequency analysis was averaged across the alpha frequency (8\u201312 Hz), in relation to the patient's first button press. To better visualize the frequency response in the alpha frequency band, the results of time frequency analysis were averaged across the alpha frequency band and time (\u2013200\u20130 ms prior to the response) for all electrodes of a single patient. Results were then plotted on an average brain surface calculated from all patients using BrainVoyager software. This was done by interpolating the average value of each electrode using an exponential decay weight function with radius of 8 mm around the location of each electrode. The results of this analysis obtained from one representative patient are presented in Figure  . \n\nLastly, time-frequency analysis was performed in order to determine the selection range of gamma frequency. Time-frequency analysis was calculated for the pre-SMA electrodes and was averaged across all electrodes. We used event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), which measures the modulation of amplitude induced by a specific event, relative to baseline (Delorme and Makeig,  ). This analysis was evoked by stimulus onset within a window of 2 s. ERSP was calculated from the power spectrum over a sliding latency window and averaged across data trials. The window was calculated using the Stockwell Transform (Poh and Marziliano,  ). The mean baseline log power spectrum was subtracted from each spectral estimate. Significance of deviations from baseline power was assessed using a bootstrap method (Delorme and Makeig,  ). Briefly, a surrogate data distribution was constructed by selecting spectral estimates for each trial from randomly selected latency windows in the specified epoch baseline (\u2013200\u20130 ms, prior to stimulus onset). Spectral estimates were then averaged across trials. This process was applied 200 times producing a surrogate \u201cbaseline\u201d amplitude distribution. 0.01 percentile from this distribution was then taken as the significance threshold. Only ERSP values above this threshold were considered for further analysis (Figure  ). Based on this analysis, our further analysis of gamma was based on the band of 31\u201360 Hz. This selection is in line with other studies showing that transient gamma oscillations shortly before movement-onset were detected in the 40 Hz frequency (Pfurtscheller et al.,  ). \n\nThe following pre-processing steps aimed to extract the signal from its combination with other signals and possibly broadband noise (Pereda et al.,  ): first, a narrowband notch at 50 Hz was used in order to exclude line noise. Second, the data was band-passed in order to extract alpha and gamma frequencies. We extracted the gamma frequency band at 31\u201360 Hz as previously described. In order to control for Mu rhythm (de)synchronization, we additionally performed the same analysis for the alpha frequency band (8\u201312 Hz). Filtering was performed using an elliptic infinite impulse response filter. Data was then epoched 0\u2013400 ms following each sequence presentation. This time was chosen to represent the pre-response window as no responses were present during this time; the minimum response time for the first press was 490 ms. \n\n\n##### C. iEEG functional connectivity calculation. \n  \nWe used two common methods to estimate functional connectivity between the signals recorded: co-activation and synchronization. The linear co-activation function is one of the most commonly used measures to reveal temporal coherence in the firing of cortical neurons (Brazier and Casby,  ; Gevins and Schaffer,  ; Brody,  ). This measure was used to detect more local changes in gamma coherence between the internally and externally guided conditions. \n\nPhase synchronization became increasingly popular following the availability of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm and is commonly used to measure neurophysiologic signals between more distant neuronal populations (Tass,  ; Womelsdorf et al.,  ; Miller,  ; Lachaux et al.,  ). This method was employed to detect synchronized activity between the lateral and medial PFC, which reflects a physiological process of communication between them. The analysis steps of both methods were based on Pereda et al. ( ). \n\n\n\n#### Functional co-activation analysis \n  \n  Compute power envelope.    For each electrode, the power envelope   A   was calculated by applying the Hilbert transform   on the preprocessed data in each frequency band   x  (  t  ), deriving the analytic signal   and taking the absolute value of the result |Z (  t  )| = A(  t  ) (Le Van Quyen et al.,  ) (Figure  ). \n\n  Compute correlation.    In order to assess the differences in co-activation between the IGAP and EGAP conditions, the linear cross-correlation between electrode pairs was calculated for each condition:  , where \u03bc and \u03c3 denote mean and variance (Figure  ). \n\n  Determine significance.    The significance and direction of the difference between the correlation coefficient   c   for the two conditions was assessed using the Fisher transformation, taking into account the relative bandwidth of the signal, and corrected for multiple comparison using the FDR correction (Benjamini and Hochberg,  ; Hemmelmann et al.,  ) (Figure  ). \n\n\n#### Functional synchronization analysis \n  \nFor each electrode, the instantaneous phase \u03d5 (  t  ) in each band was estimated using the analytic signal   Z  (  t  ) defined above by calculating Im[log (  Z   (  t  ))] = \u03d5 (  t  ). Synchronization between the instantaneous phase of electrode pairs was estimated using the phase locking value  , where \u03d5 (  t  ) = \u03d5  (  t  ) \u2212 \u03d5  (  t  ) (Lachaux et al.,  ), and the difference between the values of \u03b3  for the two conditions was calculated. The statistical significance of the differences was assessed using surrogate data and corrected for multiple comparison using FDR. Surrogate data were computed by calculating the phase locking value on randomly selected time-shifted data of the same length (400 ms) (Quian Quiroga et al.,  ). \n\n  Subtract conditions.    For both connectivity results, in order to estimate the total difference between the conditions for all electrode pairs, we compared the number of significant connections in one direction (IGAP > EGAP) to those in the opposite direction (EGAP > IGAP) and assessed the significance using sign test (Figure  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Study 1: fMRI experiment in healthy participants \n  \n#### Behavior \n  \nBoth the IGAP and EGAP for simple finger tapping sequence elicited similar average response times [Mean IGPA = 323 ms, Mean EGAP = 347 ms,   t  (1,26) = 1.3,   p   = 0.74]. As movement rate is know to be a potentially confounding variable in fMRI studies comparing self paced and externally paced stimuli [e.g., (Jahanshahi et al.,  )], the speed of responses was measured as the time between stimuli presentation and the first response, the time between the first and second press, and the time between the second and third press. As can be seen in Figure  , there was no significant difference between IGAP and EGAP response rate for the first, second, and third button presses (  t   = \u22121.73,   p   = 0.1,   t   = \u22120.65,   p   = 0.52;   t   = \u22120.35,   p   = 0.72, respectively). \n  \n Response time analysis.   Behavioral analysis of response time in healthy participants and in patients showed an overall longer response time for the patients (  p   < 0.005). No significant difference was present between internally and externally guided action planning for the first, second, and third presses. \n  \n\n#### Brain \n  \nFollowing our hypothesis regarding the spatial selectivity of the DMPFC, we first investigated differential activity in the a-priori defined regions of interest; the pre-SMA and SMA-proper, and the DLPFC as a comparison. Figure   shows 3D maps of activation overlay of two main contrasts: EGAP vs. rest and IGAP vs. rest, demonstrating that the pre-SMA and DLPFC, but not the SMA proper, show distinct activation during IGAP (pink colored regions). Beta weights estimated from the designated ROIs show that while the pre-SMA and DLPFC were sensitive to the source of planning, showing greater activation during the IGAP than EGAP, the SMA-proper was not sensitive to the source and was equally activated by IGAP and EGAP. An additional whole brain GLM analysis with direct contrast between IGAP and EGAP showed that the pre-SMA, but not the SMA proper, exhibited selective activation for source of planning; i.e., IGAP more than EGAP (  p   < 0.00005 uncorrected, random effect,   N   = 14) (see Table   for detailed mapping results). \n  \n Effects of source of action planning on fMRI activations. (A)   3D overlay of group activation map (  N   = 14) onto a standardized T1-weighted MRI. (IGAP vs. rest in pink, EGAP vs. rest in green).   (B)   Estimated effect of source of planning as indicated by regional beta weights. The pre-SMA and the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) showed greater activation for the internally compared to externally guided conditions. *Indicates statistically significant difference at   p   < 0.005. \n    \n Regions related to the different levels of source of planning (IGAP vs. EGAP)  . \n  \nAtlas coordinates represent the Talairach coordinate system. SMA = Supplementary motor area; M1 = primary motor area; IGAP = Internally guided action planning, EGAP = Externally guided action planning. \n  \nFollowing our second hypothesis regarding selective functional connectivity of the DMPFC, we performed functional connectivity using sub-regions in the DMPFC (i.e., pre-SMA and SMA-proper) as seed regions for time-course activation obtained during IGAP or EGAP periods (see Methods). Overlaid probability maps show that the pre-SMA but not the SMA proper was functionally more connected with the MFG and with the premotor cortex during periods of the IGAP than the EGAP. Of note, a significant overlap between the two connectivity maps was mainly present in occipital lobe areas (Figure  ,   p   < 0.05, FDR corrected for each connectivity map). Direct comparison between the functional connectivity maps showed that only the pre-SMA was significantly more connected with the DLPFC during the IGAP relative to EGAP conditions, (  p   < 0.05, uncorrected, random effect) (Table  , Figure  ). \n  \n Group functional connectivity networks presented on inflated brain. (A)   Probability maps of the results driven by SMA proper (green network) and pre-SMA (red network) during internally (A-left panel)\u2014or externally (A-right panel) guided planning (  p   < 0.05).   (B)   Direct contrast between the pre-SMA and the SMA proper maps for the internally guided vs. externally guided contrast (  p   < 0.05, uncorrected, random effect). \n    \n Functional connectivity analysis  . \n  \nAtlas coordinates represent peak values in the Talairach coordinate system. SMA = Supplementary motor area; DLPFC = Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; IGAP = Internally guided action planning, EGAP = Externally guided action planning. \n  \n\n\n### Study 2: iEEG experiment in patients with epilepsy \n  \n#### Behavior \n  \nResponse time for the task performed during the iEEG recordings yielded a similar pattern of results to those of the healthy participants although of a different magnitude; the response time of patients across all conditions was longer than that of healthy participants (  F   = 12.02,   p   < 0.005) (Figure  ). As in healthy participants, response rates for the first, second, and third press were not significantly different between IGAP and EGAP conditions (  t   = 0.85,   p   = 0.41,   t   = 0.41,   p   = 0.68;   t   = 0.13,   p   = 0.80, respectively). \n\n\n#### Brain \n  \nWe first validated that the electrodes elicited the expected evoked potentials following visual instructions to perform simple sequences of either IGAP or EGAP. A total of 48 trials for each condition were included. For all patients N170 and P250 wave-peaks were recognized in response to stimulus presentation (Figure  ). We then examined the distributed time-frequency, averaged across the alpha band, which was assumed to be evoked by the patient's finger tapping on the response box (see Methods). Power plots of this analysis revealed alpha de-synchronization in the primary motor area of all patients who had electrodes in the vicinity of primary motor areas (Figure  ). \n  \n ERPs validation.   ERPs evoked by stimulus showed typical N170, P250 peaks. Significant peaks are marked in red (  p   < 0.05). Examples are shown for each patient for one representative electrode in fronto-parietal regions (marked in red) for all conditions. \n    \n Alpha brain power plots.   The results of time frequency analysis, averaged across the alpha band (8\u201312 Hz), show alpha de-synchronization in the primary motor area. \n  \nUsing time frequency analysis via ERSP (see Methods) we found that the mean of all electrodes in the vicinity of pre-SMA showed a significant increase in synchronization in the range of 30\u201350 Hz, peaking at around 600 ms following stimulus presentations (Figure  ). Based on this finding, our further analysis of gamma was based on the 31\u201360 Hz band. As a comparison we used the alpha band as typically defined by others (Pfurtscheller and Neuper,  ). \n\n\n#### iEEG functional connectivity \n  \nTo test our first hypothesis regarding the role of the gamma band in enhanced connectivity between MPFC and LPFC, we applied iEEG amplitude co-activation and phase synchronization analyses (see Methods). Figure   presents the distribution of electrodes obtained from a total of 67 electrodes (  n   = 5). This map was overlaid on an fMRI activation map of the 14 healthy participants using direct contrast between internally and externally guided conditions. Of note, as the electrodes in the lateral aspect of the prefrontal cortex were more distributed than the anatomical margins of the DLPFC, we more broadly defined this area as the LPFC for the iEEG study. \n  \n Functional iEEG co-activation in epileptic patients (67 electrodes) in gamma (31\u201360 Hz).   Electrodes are shown on healthy participants' fMRI activation maps of the direct contrast between internally and externally generated action planning (  n   = 15,   P   < 0.015, random effect, uncorrected). The marked electrodes in the DMPFC and LPFC (purple and blue, respectively) show significantly increased inter-regional gamma co-activation for internally compared to externally guided simple finger tapping. The color of each electrode indicates the number of significant connections it has with electrodes from the other set. \n  \n  iEEG co-activation.    We first calculated the strength of co-activation in the gamma band between electrodes in the DMPFC and those in the LPFC, with respect to IGAP and EGAP conditions. While 15.62% of the 192 possible connections showed a significant increase for IGAP compared to EGAP (  p   < 0.05, FDR corrected), only 1.05% of the connections showed an increase for EGAP compared to IGAP (  p   < 0.05, FDR corrected). This difference was significant by a sign-test (  p   < 2.477e ) (Figure  ). In order to illustrate the distribution of electrodes showing increased gamma co-activation, the electrodes were color coded by their number of significant connections with the corresponding region (Figure  ). \n  \n Inter and Intra regions gamma synchronization and co-activation.   Co-activation   (A1)   and synchronization   (B1)   in the gamma band between DMPFC and LPFC and between each of the DMPFC sub regions; pre-SMA, and SMA proper with the LPFC   (A2, B2)   was significantly stronger for internally guided action planning. Within regions analysis showed increased co-activation for internally guided action planning within the DMPFC but not within the LPFC   (C1)  . Such an increase was also present for the pre-SMA, but not the SMA proper   (C2)  . Within regions synchronization revealed no difference between the conditions   (D1\u20132)  . Significant difference between the conditions was tested using sign-test. \n  \nThe electrodes situated within the DMPFC region were then separated into those closer to the pre-SMA or the SMA-proper. Co-activation was calculated again for electrodes confined to each region with respect to electrodes in the LPFC. Figure   shows that 22.05% of the possible connections between the pre-SMA and the LPFC showed increased co-activation for the IGAP compared to the EGAP conditions (  p   < 0.05, FDR corrected), while only 1.47% showed an increase for EGAP compared to IGAP (  p   < 0.05, FDR corrected). This difference was significant per a sign test (  p   < 5.18e ). Electrodes in the SMA proper also showed a similar effect, though to a lesser degree of significance as shown by a sign test (  p   < 0.03). \n\nFigure   shows quantitative estimations of the difference in such gamma co-activation between IGAP and EGAP within each region of interest. A significant increase for IGAP was found for co-activation inside the DMPFC (  p   < 2.46e , sign-test) with 16.85% of the connections showing increase compared to only 1.16% for EGAP (Figure  ). Such an increase was also found when examined for electrodes in vicinity to the pre-SMA alone (  p   < 1.05e , sign-test) with 46.15% of the connections showing a significant increase for IGAP while only 3.84% of the connections showed increase for EGAP. In contrast, electrodes confined to the SMA-proper did not show a significant difference in co-activation with the LPFC between IGAP and EGAP (  p   = 0.5,   p   = 0.125, sign-test, respectively). (Figure  ). Similarly, iEEG co-activation analysis for intra- and inter-regions was performed for the alpha band, however, no significant differences were found when comparing IGAP and EGAP conditions, in both directions. In addition, the percent of significant connections for each of the comparisons was very low (Mean % significant connections: 0.87, SD = 0.695). \n\n  iEEG phase synchronization.    To further elucidate the underlying physiological occurrence of the observed regional co-activation we performed a phase synchronization analysis on electrodes within the DMPFC with relation to electrodes in the LPFC. A significant increase in synchronization between the DMPFC and the LPFC was detected for the IGAP vs. EGAP conditions (  p   < 0.0241, sign-test); 9.72% of the possible connections showed greater increase for IGAP compared to EGAP (  p   < 0.05, FDR corrected), while only 3.7% of the connections showed increase for the EGAP compared to IGAP (  p   < 0.05, FDR corrected) (Figure  ). We then repeated these analyses for electrodes located within the DMPFC subregions; pre-SMA and SMA proper, and found a similarly increased synchronization with the LPFC in the IGAP condition (  p   < 0.0042,   p   < 0.0039, respectively) (Figure  ). Synchronization was also tested within each of the regions, however, this analysis revealed no increase in synchronization for either condition or region (Figure  ). Synchronization analysis was also performed for the alpha band, but no significant differences were found when comparing IGAP and EGAP conditions. The percent of significant connections detected for each of the comparisons was in fact very low (Mean% significant connections: 1.77, SD = 2.03). \n\nTo summarize, increased iEEG gamma co-activation and synchronization during IGAP was found between electrodes situated in the medial- and lateral aspects of the DPFC. Furthermore, although both electrodes in the pre-SMA and SMA-proper showed this effect, the increased gamma co-activation with the DLPFC was more robust for electrodes confined to the pre-SMA than to those in the SMA-proper. Importantly, increased intra-regional gamma co-activation (and not synchronization) was evident only during IGAP for electrodes in the pre-SMA but neither for those in SMA proper nor the DLPFC. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nUsing a multi-modal approach of fMRI and iEEG in two separate studies, we showed that increased functional connectivity between the medial and lateral aspects of the PFC underlies internally-guided action planning. This is in line with our hypothesis of communication between motor regions and decision making related regions in the emergence of IGAP. \n\nThe fMRI uniquely showed that functional connectivity between DMPFC and DLPFC grows in a spatial gradient from posterior to anterior aspects of the DMPFC corresponding to the SMA-proper and pre-SMA, respectively. The iEEG further revealed that this functional connectivity is mediated temporally by increased gamma oscillations as demonstrated by amplitude co-activation as well as phase synchronization between electrodes situated in the DMPFC and LPFC areas. Finally, in correspondence with the activation gradient found by the fMRI analysis, electrodes confined to the pre-SMA, but not the SMA proper, also showed enhanced intra-regional co-activation during internally guided action planning, supporting a central role of this area in the emergence of internally generated motor behaviors. \n\nIn line with our hypothesis, the fMRI functional connectivity analysis suggests that the involvement of the pre-SMA in internally guided planning is related to enhanced connectivity with the DLPFC. While it is known that there are anatomical connections between the pre-SMA and the lateral PFC (Johansen-Berg et al.,  ; Kim et al.,  ), we uniquely demonstrated a task related increase between these regions in IGAP. \n\nThe increase in gamma oscillations between signals recorded from electrodes in the DMPFC and those in the LPFC (Figure  ) may offer a mechanism of neuronal communication for motor planning tasks, guided internally by one's own choice (i.e., selecting the finger used for tapping) rather than by external stimulus. EEG gamma-band activity recorded from intracranial electrodes was previously shown to increase during cognitive processing such as attention related to reading, memory formation, and recall, compared to a resting baseline (Fell et al.,  ; Sederberg et al.,  ; Mainy et al.,  ; Lachaux et al.,  ; Ray et al.,  ). The critical role of gamma oscillations for internally initiated movements was previously demonstrated in Parkinson's disease patients who often suffer from reduced ability to self-initiate movements (van Hilten et al.,  ). In these patients, effective treatment with Levodopa was followed by increased co-activation in the gamma band during voluntary movement (Cassidy et al.,  ; Fogelson et al.,  ; Trottenberg et al.,  ; Kuhn et al.,  ). As far as we know this study is the first to show direct electrical evidence for selective increase in gamma oscillations between motor and cognitive aspects of PFC related to planning, particularly when it is internally guided. \n\nThis increased connectivity between the DMPFC and LPFC remained significant when separating the DMPFC into SMA proper and pre-SMA. However, it should be noted that in both synchronization and a co-activation analysis, this effect was smaller for the SMA-proper than for the pre-SMA, hinting at different recruitment of such process by these regions. We suggest that the connectivity in the gamma band found between the SMA-proper and LPFC putatively results from the vicinity of the electrodes within the DMPFC, and not from direct connection between these regions, as such anatomical connection was not found in previous studies (Johansen-Berg et al.,  ; Lehericy et al.,  ). This assumption is in accordance with our fMRI finding showing greater functional connectivity between the pre-SMA and DLPFC than between SMA-proper and DLPFC during IGAP (Figure  ). \n\nIt is important to note that the increase in co-activation and synchronization cannot be accounted for by an overall increase in synchronization in the brain as there was no increase in co-activation and synchronization within the LPFC. We assert that the converging results, showing increased inter-regional gamma oscillations via both co-activation and phase synchronization measures during IGAP, strengthen the validity of our findings. In addition, while gamma oscillations recorded by scalp EEG may reflect miniature saccades instead of cognitive processes, iEEG is immune to this influence (Yuval-Greenberg et al.,  ; Kovach et al.,  ). \n\nThe increased gamma co-activation found for internally-guided action planning within the pre-SMA, but not the SMA proper, points to an essential role of this area in the mechanism underlying internally generated action planning. This discovery corresponds with our fMRI finding of a spatial gradient showing greater selective activation for internally guided planning in the pre-SMA than in the SMA-proper (see Figure  ). Other studies also argued that while the pre-SMA is more selective to internally guided motor and language planning, the SMA-proper is more involved in the execution of planned actions rather than in their initial planning (Lee et al.,  ; Jenkins et al.,  ; Crosson et al.,  ; Tremblay and Gracco,  ; Gowen and Miall,  ). Electrophysiological recording studies in monkeys further point to the criticality of the pre-SMA to the selection of movements without the guidance of an external cue (Halsband et al.,  ). The association between increased regional gamma and fMRI activation was previously demonstrated in both animal and human studies (Logothetis et al.,  ; Nir et al.,  ). \n\nThe finding of enhanced local co-activation but not synchronization within the pre-SMA is not surprising. Phase synchronization measures global, distributed changes; that is, between two or more neural populations (Daffertshofer and van Wijk,  ), and this might be masked by a significant volume conduction among closely located electrodes (Wennberg and Lozano,  ). In contrast, increased activity within a neural population results in increased amplitude, which is better reflected in the co-activation measure. \n\nMost studies have failed to account for the tendency of performance to slow down as it becomes more internally based. In the current study we controlled for this using a simple tapping task for both internally and EGAP, resulting in similar response times and rates for both conditions (Figure  ). The similarity between response times in both conditions also confirms that the gamma activity was not related to attentional control mechanisms which have been shown in a previous EEG study to be related to response time (Gonzalez Andino et al.,  ). \n\nIn summary, using both fMRI and iEEG we demonstrated that self-generated motor behavior involves connectivity between motor and decision-making related nodes, specifically via gamma oscillations. Both fMRI and iEEG results point to greater recruitment of the pre-SMA relative to the SMA-proper in execution of actions guided by self choice compared to external instructions, suggesting that these subregions dissociate from one another when internally generated action planning takes place. Future studies will test the generality of such selectivity to internally driven processes in other cognitive modes such as language. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nPatient\tAge\tAge of onset\tVerbal comprehension???\tPerceptual organization???\tVerbal memory composite???\tVisual memory composite???\n1\t20\t5\t63%\t32%\t27%\t90%\n2\t35\t11\t68%\t68%\t27%\t1%\n3\t26\t9\t50%\t68%\t42%\t24%\n4\t35\t14\t58%\t5%\t1%\t1%\n5\t12\t4\t50%\t69%\t72%\t8%\n### Caption\nPatients demographics and performance during pre-operative neuropsychological assesment.\n### Footer\naage-corrected percentiles from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WAIS-III).bage-corrected percentiles from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test.cage-corrected percentiles from the Rey Complex Figure test.\n\n\n## ID: T2\n### Label: Table 2\nPatient\tAge\tExamined hemisphere\tHand examined\tEpilepsy type\tEpileptic location\tN DMPFC\tN LPFC\n1\t20\tleft\tRight and left\tSimple and complex partial seizures\tLeft frontal lobe epilepsy\t6\t6\n2\t35\tleft\tright\tComplex partial seizures\tLeft MTS\t5\t6\n3\t26\tleft\tright\tComplex partial seizures\tFrontal lobe epilepsy\t6\t6\n4-run1\t35\tleft\tright\tComplex partial seizures\tRight frontal parietal epilepsy\t5\t6\n4-run2\t35\tleft\tright\tComplex partial seizures\tRight frontal parietal epilepsy\t5\t5\n5\t12\tright\tleft\tSimple partial seizures\tRight frontal epilepsy\t6\t5\n### Caption\nDetails of epilepsy type and electrode location.\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: T3\n### Label: Table 3\nRegion\tX Y Z\nMedial superior frontal gyrus\t\u22122, 18, 48\nRight postcentral gyrus\t39, \u221225, 55\nLeft anterior cingulate\\pre-SMA\t\u22127, 16, 47\nRight anterior cingulate\\pre-SMA\t\u22124, 16, 45\n### Caption\nRegions related to the different levels of source of planning (IGAP vs. EGAP).\n### Footer\nAtlas coordinates represent the Talairach coordinate system.

However, the continuous stimulation characteristic of EA treatment presents challenges to the use of conventional functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) approaches for the investigation of neural mechanisms mediating treatment response because of the requirement for brief and intermittent stimuli in event related or block designed task paradigms. A relatively new analysis method, functional connectivity fMRI (fcMRI), has great potential for studying continuous treatment modalities such as EA. In a previous study, we found that, compared with sham acupuncture, EA can significantly reduce Periaqueductal Gray (PAG) activity when subsequently evoked by experimental pain. Given the PAG's important role in mediating acupuncture analgesia, in this study we investigated functional connectivity with the area of the PAG we previously identified and how that connectivity was affected by genuine and sham EA. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nForty-eight subjects, who were randomly assigned to receive either genuine or sham EA paired with either a high or low expectancy manipulation, completed the study. Direct comparison of each treatment mode's functional connectivity revealed: significantly greater connectivity between the PAG, left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and precuneus for the contrast of genuine minus sham; significantly greater connectivity between the PAG and right anterior insula for the contrast of sham minus genuine; no significant differences in connectivity between different contrasts of the two expectancy levels. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur findings indicate the intrinsic functional connectivity changes among key brain regions in the pain matrix and default mode network during genuine EA compared with sham EA. We speculate that continuous genuine EA stimulation can modify the coupling of spontaneous activity in brain regions that play a role in modulating pain perception. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nAcupuncture has been used to alleviate pain for thousands of years. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and many meta-analyses have concluded that acupuncture effectively relieves clinical pain for disorders such as knee osteoarthritis [ ], migraine [ ] and chronic low back pain [ - ]. For instance, three recent large trials found that acupuncture is statistically, clinically [ - ], and cost-effectively [ - ] superior to either optimal guidelines-based conventional therapy, or waitlist controls for chronic low back pain. However, the lack of a significant clinical difference between genuine or sham (placebo) acupuncture has raised skepticism and limited acupuncture's acceptance. \n\nIn parallel, brain imaging tools such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) have been used to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying acupuncture needle stimulation [ - ]} and acupuncture treatment effects [ , - ]. The goal of these studies is to elucidate the changes in neural activity in brain networks associated with acupuncture needle stimulation and to link them to the therapeutic effects of treatment. The block- and event-related paradigms often used in fMRI studies, while well suited to studying the effects of brief intermittent acupuncture needle stimuli, are not suitable for studying some modes of clinical acupuncture treatment. For instance, one of the most important acupuncture treatment modalities, electroacupuncture (EA), is typically administered with continual stimulation for twenty minutes or more. Elucidating the neural substrates of long-duration EA stimulation requires a new approach. \n\nRecently, functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) has attracted the attention of brain imaging investigators [ - ]. This technique provides a potential fMRI approach appropriate for the study of EA. Based on the premise that low-frequency components of the spontaneous MR imaging signal can provide information about the intrinsic functional and anatomical organization of the brain [ , ], fcMRI investigates the connectivity between all brain regions and a specifically defined \"seed\", or region of interest (ROI). Recent findings using fcMRI have significantly enhanced our understanding of the intrinsic functional and anatomical connections of the brain, including those that underlie pain perception [ ] and modulation [ , ], and pathological changes in these connections that are associated with chronic pain in patients [ - ]. Recently, investigators have also reported functional connectivity changes within the default mode network [ , ], sensorimotor networks [ ], and amygdala-associated brain networks [ , ] after acupuncture needle stimulation, suggesting that this approach is sufficiently sensitive to detect neural modulation associated with acupuncture treatment. \n\nTherefore, in this new analysis of previously unpublished data collected in a randomized placebo-controlled study [ , ], we investigated the functional connectivity of PAG changes during EA stimulation and sham EA stimulation at acupoints Large Intestine 3 and 4 (LI3 and LI4) on the right hand. The PAG was chosen for analysis because: 1) it is well known that the PAG plays a role in pain modulation [ - ]; 2) PAG has been found to play an important role in acupuncture analgesia [ - ]; and 3) in a previous analysis conducted using this same data set, we found that fMRI signal change to calibrated heat pain was inhibited at the PAG after genuine acupuncture treatment, but was not influenced by level of analgesia expectancy [ ]. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis study utilized a previously collected fMRI dataset investigating brain mechanisms underlying genuine and sham electroacupuncture's analgesic effects. This paper will focus on the fMRI data collected during the acupuncture administration. Results on the treatments' analgesic effects - as measured by changes in subjective pain ratings and in objective brain response - have been published separately [ , ]. Please see the original papers for these results as well as for additional details on experimental procedures not relevant to the present manuscript. \n\n### Subjects \n  \nSeventy-seven healthy, right-handed subjects participated in this study; all subjects were acupuncture naive and had no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. As approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital's Institutional Review Board, all subjects provided their written consent to participate. Subjects were then randomized to one of four groups: genuine EA or sham EA paired with either high expectancy (HE) or low expectancy (LE) manipulation. After their participation, subjects were debriefed as to the goals of the experiment and un-blinded to their randomization. \n\n\n### Experimental Protocol \n  \nThis study consisted of two behavioral testing sessions and one fMRI scanning session, each separated by a minimum of three days. The goals of the behavioral sessions were to familiarize subjects with the heat pain rating system and to manipulate their expectations of acupuncture's analgesic effects. In the subsequent fMRI session, the brain networks involved in genuine and sham EA, as well as in HE and LE conditions, were examined. A general overview of the experimental design is presented below. \n\n\n### Session 1 \n  \nThis first behavioral session was used to determine appropriate stimulus intensities of heat pain and to familiarize subjects with the pain rating scales. Briefly, temperatures eliciting subjective intensity ratings in the LOW pain range (~5; which indicates weak on the 0-20 Sensory Scale) and HIGH pain range (~15; strong) were selected for each individual using an ascending series of noxious stimuli (increasing by 1\u00b0C per stimulus). We then applied a series of 8 noxious stimuli, 4 HIGH pain and 4 LOW pain, presented in random order, and a series of 6 identical HIGH pain noxious stimuli to the right arm. Temperatures were adjusted when necessary to ensure that each subject's subjective ratings of HIGH and LOW remained in the desired range and the final temperature settings were used in the following sessions. \n\n\n### Session 2 \n  \nTo prepare subjects for the expectancy manipulation, and in order to establish subjects' expectancy for the duration of the study, subjects were first told that responses to acupuncture can be variable and that a given subject's response tends to remain consistent across sessions. Subjects then viewed a Traditional Chinese Medicine meridian diagram and were falsely told that, according to previous literature, acupuncture could only produce analgesia on the meridian side of the arm. \n\nFollowing the preparatory disclaimer, pain stimuli were applied according to the same procedures as session 1. Then, according to their randomization, subjects received either genuine or sham EA. Finally, subjects received post-treatment pain stimuli. Though all subjects were told they were receiving the same pre-treatment heat stimuli so as to test acupuncture's analgesic effect, we actually only followed this protocol on subjects in the LE groups. In the HE groups, we surreptitiously decreased temperatures on the side of the arm subjects were told was the treated meridian in order to elicit reduced pain ratings and give subjects an unmistakable experience of analgesia. (This expectancy manipulation is a modification from previous studies [ , - ].) \n\n\n### Session 3 \n  \nSubjects were told that the procedures from Session 2 would be repeated inside the fMRI scanner. First, fMRI scans were acquired during the pre-treatment application of noxious thermal stimuli. Then, another fMRI scan was acquired during the administration of sham or genuine EA, which provided the data for the functional connectivity analysis described in this manuscript. Lastly, subjects were scanned post-acupuncture treatment while additional heat stimuli were applied. LE groups received the same temperature thermal stimuli as they had before treatment. Although the HE groups were informed that Session 2 procedures would be repeated, only one reduced temperature heat stimuli was administered on the meridian side of the right forearm arm to remind subjects of the analgesia they experienced in Session 2. All other heat stimuli, applied after this \"expectancy boost,\" were delivered at their original temperatures in order to test the treatment effect. In this study, we will focus only on the electro-acupuncture stimulation scan; additional details on the results of the fMRI scans acquired during heat pain application are reported in our previous publications [ , ]. \n\n\n### Acupuncture administration \n  \nIdentical genuine or sham EA was performed by a licensed acupuncturist at acupoints LI3 and LI4 on the right hand during Sessions 2 and 3. LI 3 is located in the depression proximal to the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. LI 4 is located on the dorsum of the hand, between the 1st and 2nd metacarpal bones, in the middle of the 2nd metacarpal bone on the radial side. Both LI 3 and LI 4 can produce analgesic effects according to acupuncture literature [ , ]. \n\nFor genuine EA, needles were inserted into the skin at a depth of about 1.5 cm and adjusted until subjective   deqi   sensations [ ], but no sharp pain, was evoked. Needles were then connected to an EA device passing a 2 Hz current (OMS Medical Supplies IC-1107) [ ], and the intensity was gradually increased to the highest level subjects could tolerate without the sensation of sharp pain. Once the appropriate level of stimulation was achieved for each subject, the level of current was recorded. After calibrating the intensity of the EA stimulation, treatment was applied for approximately 25 minutes. The treatment was further broken down into three 6.5-minute current ON and four 1.5-minute current OFF blocks. An fMRI scan was acquired for 23.5 minutes encompassing the entire treatment (Figure  ). \n  \n Acupuncture stimulation procedures  . A) Anatomical location of the acupoints LI3 and LI4 on the right hand; used for genuine and sham acupuncture administration. B) Schematic illustration of the timing during treatment blocks. In total, electroacupuncture (EA) treatment was applied for approximately 25 minutes at a frequency of 2 Hz. Treatment was given in blocks of 6.5-minute current ON and four 1.5-minute current OFF blocks. For sham EA, the sham needle was attached to a de-activated EA device, and no current was applied during the 25 minute treatment. \n  \nFor sham EA, specially-designed Streitberger sham acupuncture needles were placed on the surface of the skin and connected to a de-activated electroacupuncture device. The Streitberger placebo needle has been validated and used in many studies [ , , - ]. Total scan time was the same for the sham group as for the genuine EA group. \n\nAfter treatments, sensations evoked by genuine and sham EA were measured with the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS), a rubric created by acupuncture researchers at MGH [ , ]. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Acquisition and Analysis \n  \nBrain imaging was performed with a 3-axis gradient head coil in a 3 Tesla Siemens MRI System equipped for echo planar imaging. At the midpoint of the study, an MRI scanner upgrade replaced the 3 Tesla head-only Siemens Allegra MRI System with a 3 Tesla whole-body Siemens TIM Trio MRI System. To avoid any potential confounding due to scanner hardware and software changes, pre-post scanner upgrade studies were conducted at the Martinos Center at the time of transition from the Allegra to the Trio scanner system and the data were used to optimize the image acquisition parameters to be as closely matched as possible while still taking advantage of the benefits of the scanner upgrade. Multiple previous studies have demonstrated that when these careful measures are taken to match scan acquisition parameters, inter-subject variability is the predominant source of variance in structural and functional MRI data, regardless of scanner type or manufacturer [ - ]. Therefore we were careful to randomize comparable numbers of subjects from each of the four groups across the two scanner systems: 6-8 subjects per group were tested on the old scanner and 4-6 subjects per group were tested on the new scanner. \n\nThirty axial slices (4 mm thick with 1 mm skip) parallel to the anterior and posterior commissure covering the whole brain were imaged with 2000 ms TR, 40 ms TE, 90\u00b0 flip angle and 3.13 \u00d7 3.13 mm in-plane spatial resolution. For the scan acquired during EA stimulation, a total of 705 time points were collected during an acupuncture treatment lasting twenty-three minutes and 30 seconds. A high-resolution 3 D MPRAGE sequence for anatomic localization was also collected. \n\n\n### Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nWe used a spherical seed region located in the PAG, centered at 0 -28 -10 (Montreal Neurological Institute [  MNI  ] coordinates) with a 2 mm radius. This seed served as a pre-defined anatomical region from which we explored connectivity to other brain regions. The seed region coordinates are based on our previous analysis of the fMRI signal changes evoked by calibrated heat pain before and after treatment using this same data set. The PAG voxel with the maximal pain-evoked fMRI signal change after genuine EA treatment, as compared with sham EA treatment, was located at 0 -28 -10 [ ]. This location is situated in the ventral PAG, and as such, it belongs to the \"analgesic zone\" of the PAG [ ]. \n\nMethods for functional connectivity analysis were similar to previous studies [ - ]. In summary, the long EA scan for each subject was split into 3 epochs (as illustrated in Figure  ) in which the current was turned on for participants receiving genuine EA, with each ON epoch lasting 6 minutes. (The first 30 seconds of each EA treatment was excluded to account for the time subjects spent acclimating to the application of the current from the EA device). Functional data were first preprocessed to decrease image artifacts and to eliminate differences in odd/even slice intensity. Rigid body translation and rotation was used to reduce within- and across-run head movement. Data were re-sampled to 3 mm isotropic voxels after transforming anatomical and functional data to atlas space. \n\nThe functional connectivity analysis required additional filtering of low- and high-frequency components (0.009 Hz < f < 0.083 Hz) and spatial 8 mm Gaussian kernel smoothing. Other variables that were simultaneously regressed included movement parameters, whole brain signal, lateral ventricle mean signals, deep white matter ROI signal, and the first temporal derivative of each time course. The resulting time course was used in the subsequent analysis. Next, we performed correlation maps between the seed region and all voxels across the whole brain. Analysis produced seed region-whole brain voxel correlation coefficients. Fisher's r-to-z transformation was used to convert correlation maps into z maps. \n\nGroup analysis was applied with a random effects analysis using a one sample t-test. To further explore differences in the functional connectivity of PAG between the different acupuncture modes and expectancy levels, an analysis equivalent to an ANOVA was performed. More specifically, to calculate the main effect of acupuncture, a two-sample t-test comparing the pre- minus post difference was performed between the cohort receiving genuine acupuncture treatment (pooling the two expectancy groups) and the cohort receiving sham EA treatment (pooling the two expectancy groups). Then, to calculate the main effect of expectancy, a two-sample t-test comparing the pre- minus post difference was performed between the high expectancy condition (pooling the acupuncture groups) and the low expectancy condition (pooling the acupuncture groups). Finally, to calculate the interaction between expectancy and acupuncture, a two sample t-test comparing the pre- minus post difference was performed between the cohorts receiving genuine EA with high expectancy + sham EA with low expectancy and the cohorts receiving sham EA with high expectancy + genuine EA with low expectancy. This method has been used in our previous studies [ ] and is equivalent to the information provided by an ANOVA analysis. In addition, post-hoc comparisons were calculated to test the difference between treatment groups using a two-sample t-test. \n\nFor all analyses, the threshold was set at voxel-wise   p   < 0.001. To correct for multiple comparisons, we ran Monte Carlo simulations with AlphaSim to obtain corrected type I error  . The results showed that, in our study, signal voxel threshold p < 0.001 combining 31 voxels has a corrected threshold of p < 0.05 at the cluster level. Thus, the threshold of voxel-wise p < 0.001 uncorrected with 31 contiguous voxels was used in this study. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nOf seventy-seven healthy enrolled subjects, forty-eight (average age 26.4 \u00b1 4.9; 24 males and 24 females) completed the study; each of the four treatment groups contained twelve subjects. \n\n### MASS ratings \n  \nWe used the MASS to quantify the intensity of subjects' sensations experienced during acupuncture treatment. Mean ratings differed between the genuine and sham group. For example, there were higher ratings of \"dull pain\", \"throbbing pain\" and \"soreness\" during genuine treatment, compared to sham. No sensations were rated higher in the sham group, compared to genuine. Additionally, there were sensations that did not differ between genuine and sham, e.g. \"warm\", \"fullness\", and \"heaviness\" yielded similar ratings in both treatment groups. To further assess whether there were differences in average MASS ratings amongst the four groups, we performed a fixed effect ANOVA using treatment mode (genuine and sham), and expectancy (high and low) as factors. The results showed that the four groups were significantly different, F (3,44) = 7.9, p = 0.0002. Subjects in both low and high expectancy genuine groups reported significantly greater MASS ratings than those in both sham groups (p < 0.002). There was no interaction between treatment mode and expectancy level (p = 0.8). \n\n\n### fMRI results \n  \nFunctional connectivity results (as shown in Table   and Figure  ) demonstrated that during genuine EA, there was predominant positive functional connectivity between the PAG and nearby brain structures, including the bilateral PAG and surrounding areas (midbrain tegmentum, substantia nigra, raphe nucleus, hypothalamus, striatum, globus pallidum, left insula, thalamus, hippocampus, brain stem, and cerebellum). In addition, there was significant functional connectivity between the PAG and certain distant brain regions, including bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), middle cingulate cortex (MCC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, inferior parietal lobule, and left postcentral gyrus. \n  \nFunctional connectivity results during genuine EA state and sham EA state \n  \nNote: The threshold was set to voxel-wise p < 0.001 uncorrected with 31 continuous voxels.

The threshold was set to voxelwise   p   < 0.001 uncorrected with 31 contiguous voxels. \n  \nSimilarly, functional connectivity results (as shown in Table   and Figure  ) during sham EA showed a positive functional connectivity between the PAG and nearby brain structures equivalent to those activated by genuine EA. Additional brain regions that exhibited a significant connection with the seed include the right frontal operculum, anterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus and occipital cortex. \n\nThe main effect of acupuncture mode, as indicated by comparison of genuine and sham EA groups (as shown in Table   and Figure  ), showed that: during genuine EA, the PAG showed more connectivity with the left PCC than during sham EA; and during sham EA there was more connectivity to the anterior right insula (rAI)/inferior frontal gyrus than during genuine EA. The main effect of expectancy, determined by direct comparison of HE and LE groups, showed no brain regions above the threshold. An interaction between the treatment mode and expectancy level was observed in the activation of the right superior parietal lobule. \n  \nFunctional connectivity differences between treatment expectancy levels and interaction (GEA: genuine EA; SEA: sham EA; HE: high expectancy; LE: low expectancy; GH: GEA paired with HE; GL: GEA paired with LE; SH: SEA paired with HE; SL: SEA paired with LE) \n  \nNote: The threshold was set to voxel-wise p < 0.001 uncorrected with 20 continuous voxels. Peak coordinates refer to the MNI atlas \n  \nPost-hoc comparisons were calculated between the following groups: genuine EA with high expectancy vs. sham EA with high expectancy, genuine EA with high expectancy vs. genuine EA with low expectancy, sham EA with high expectancy vs. sham EA with low expectancy, and genuine EA with low expectancy vs. sham EA with low expectancy. The results indicated that genuine EA with high expectancy showed more connectivity at the right inferior parietal lobule (39 -60 48, 36 voxles) compared with genuine EA with low expectancy. In addition, genuine EA with low expectancy showed less connectivity at the right superior parietal lobule (21 -51 57, 47 voxels) compared with sham EA with low expectancy. Other comparisons showed no brain regions above the threshold. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we investigated functional connectivity of the PAG during genuine and sham EA. We found that during both genuine and sham EA, the PAG was significantly connected with brain areas surrounding the PAG, including the midbrain tegmentum, substantia nigra, raphe nucleus, hypothalamus, striatum, globus pallidum, left insula, thalamus, hippocampus, brain stem, and cerebellum as well as distant regions such as ACC, MPFC, MCC, PCC and precuneus. However, genuine EA - relative to sham EA - showed significantly stronger connectivity between the PAG and left PCC, and significantly weaker connectivity between the PAG and rAI. \n\nOur result that, during both genuine and sham EA, the PAG is functionally connected with surrounding regions and some distant regions, including the RVM and ACC, is similar to our previous study investigating the intrinsic functional connectivity of PAG during resting state using data from a different cohort [ ]. Thus, neither genuine nor sham EA appeared to significantly disrupt the connectivity between PAG and the network of brain regions seen during resting state. \n\nDuring genuine EA, we found that the PAG had a significantly stronger connectivity with the PCC. Through an examination of the existing literature, we could not find reliable evidence for a direct (monosynaptic) connection between the two structures; however, previous studies suggest a functional linkage between the PCC and brain stem [ ]. A di-synaptic connection is the most parsimonious solution for which direct evidence exists. Thus, we speculate that this functional linkage may be conveyed via the thalamus and ACC, two regions that have direct connections with both PCC and PAG. \n\nPrevious studies have implicated the PCC's involvement in responses to treatment in chronic pain patients [ , ]. In a study by Niddam and colleagues [ ], patients with myofascial pain syndrome were given painful stimulations during fMRI, and in between scanning sessions the same area was treated with low-intensity electrostimulation. When comparing responders and non-responders, a treatment effect was observed for responders in the dorsal midbrain, PCC, and the caudate [ ]. \n\nIn an early PET-study from 1995 [ ], a normalization of attenuated PCC activity after non-opioidergic treatment was seen in patients with chronic neuropathic pain. Patients with localized peripheral neuropathic pain were treated with a regional nerve block using lidocaine, resulting in significant analgesic effects. Interestingly, the neural correlate to the pain alleviated state was an increase of cerebral blood flow in the ACC and PCC. Hseieh et al. suggest that the increased neural response in the PCC could reflect the altered subjective perception of pain relief rather than the afferent blockade. The PAG is one of the key regions in the descending pain inhibitory circuitry, enabling regulation of afferent pain signals. The strong connectivity between the PAG and the PCC in response to active treatment furthers the idea that the PCC plays an important role in pain treatment. \n\nThe PCC is a key region in the default mode network (DMN): a set of specific brain structures with intrinsic fluctuations that constitute a baseline of attention and wakefulness in the human brain [ - ]. In humans, the PCC has the highest level of resting cortical glucose metabolism [ ], and is involved in processing intentions related to the self, self-awareness and conscious experience, which are key functions attributed to the DMN [ , ]. DMN activity has been shown to decrease in relation to task-evoked activity, and demonstrates an inverse relationship with the cognitive work load of the task [ - ]. Other studies show that activity in the DMN decreases in response to repeated painful stimuli [ ], and chronic pain patients seem to exhibit permanently altered DMN activity. In a study by Baliki and colleagues [ ], chronic low back pain patients displayed reduced activity in several key DMN regions compared with healthy subjects. We believe the results from this study indicate that EA may modulate the functional connectivity of the DMN, as evidenced by the increased connectivity of PCC with PAG during EA stimulation. \n\nIn this study we also found that during sham acupuncture, the PAG has stronger connectivity with the rAI compared with genuine acupuncture. The anterior insula is a key region in the pain matrix [ ] and is involved in integration and interoception of pain [ - ] and pain modulation processes such as placebo analgesia [ , ]. In a more recent study, investigators found that the pre-stimulus functional connectivity between the PAG and the anterior insula can predict subsequent pain perception [ ]. Thus, we speculate that EA stimulation may reduce brain responses to calibrated pain stimuli by interfering with the functional connectivity between the PAG and insula. Further research is needed to test this hypothesis. \n\nAn interaction between the acupuncture treatment modes and expectancy levels was observed in right superior parietal lobule. Studies have suggested that this region is involved in attention [ ] and somatosensory perception modulation [ ]. We speculate that our results may indicate that functional connectivity in genuine and sham EA are differentially modulated by expectancy levels, however further research is needed to fully understand the sources of observed functional connectivity in this study. \n\nIn this study, we did not find any significant functional connectivity changes between the high and low expectancy groups. We believed that this may be attributed to several reasons. 1) The PAG seed we chose for this study was identified in our previous analysis of the fMRI signal changes evoked by calibrated heat pain [ ] as being selectively involved in mediating acupuncture treatment effects (genuine EA vs sham EA) and not expectancy effects (high expectancy vs low expectancy). 2) Although previous studies suggested that PAG is involved in expectancy evoked placebo analgesia [ - ] or attention modulation of pain [ ], the involvement of PAG in these studies is observed during the pain application process; in contrast, this study measures functional connectivity changes during acupuncture treatment. Thus, our results are not necessarily in conflict with findings from previous studies. 3) The relatively small sample size may also prevent us from finding significant functional connectivity between the high and low expectancy conditions. Further study is needed to elucidate the influence of expectation of analgesia on the functional connectivity of PAG during the treatment phase. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn summary, during continuous EA, functional connectivity changed significantly in brain regions including PCC and rAI. Our findings indicate the intrinsic functional connectivity changes among key brain regions in the pain matrix and default mode network during genuine EA compared with sham EA. We speculate that continuous genuine EA stimulation can modify the coupling of spontaneous activity in brain regions that play a role in modulating pain perception. \n\n\n## Competing interests \n  \nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests. \n\n\n## Authors' contributions \n  \nCZ drafted the manuscript in conjunction with KJ, RL, AC, and JK; TJK, and RLG assisted with editing.

Phasic dopamine release depends on immediate reward magnitude, but presumably also on tonic dopamine levels, which may vary as a function of the average accumulation of reward over time. Using model-based fMRI in combination with a novel associative memory task, we show that immediate reward magnitude exerts a monotonically increasing influence on the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and hippocampal activity during encoding, and enhances memory. By contrast, average reward levels modulate feedback-related responses in the VTA and hippocampus in a non-linear (inverted U-shape) fashion, with similar effects on memory performance. Additionally, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) monotonically tracks average reward levels, while VTA-dACC functional connectivity is non-linearly modulated (inverted U-shape) by average reward. We propose that the dACC computes the net behavioral impact of average reward and relays this information to memory circuitry via the VTA. \n  \nRewarded stimuli are better encoded in memory. Here, the authors show that the average accumulation of reward over consecutive trials provides an additive, non-linear (inverted U-shape) modulation of memory encoding, paralleled by a similar recruitment of dopaminergic memory circuitry. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe ability to remember details associated with reward provides an adaptive advantage because it facilitates access to, for example, food and water. Indeed, reward-related information has priority in memory, as evidenced by studies reporting better memory for information presented in trials where a large reward was presented or anticipated (as compared with smaller or no reward) . Rewarding events, such as reward feedbacks or cues predictive of reward, initiate phasic dopamine release from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) , a midbrain region with dopaminergic projections to the hippocampus (HC) whose involvement in episodic memory encoding is well established . Thus, the prioritization of reward-related information is presumably mediated by dopaminergic influences on hippocampal plasticity . \n\nRecent research suggests enhanced memory encoding beyond the rewarded event itself. For example, Mather and Shoeke  reported that positive (as compared with negative) feedback enhanced recognition memory for information presented in the immediate trial, as well as in the two subsequent trials. Likewise, we recently demonstrated better memory for associations encoded in trials preceded by many (versus few) rewarded trials . Such modulation of memory for information surrounding contexts associated with frequent rewards likely offers a unique evolutionary advantage. For example, better memory for cues encountered in the vicinity of a location with high food availability increases the probability of successfully finding ones\u2019 way to this location in the future. Yet, the neural mechanisms underlying these sustained effects of reward on memory formation remain poorly understood. On the one hand, it has been proposed that average reward is encoded by tonic dopamine levels , which may result from a sustained mode of dopamine neuron activity that is capable of up- or downregulating phasic dopamine release , and would thereby modulate memory encoding. Related to this notion, one elegant study reported that the anticipation of uncertain rewards, a condition which is known to induce a sustained \u201cramping response\u201d of dopamine neurons , increased incidental memory encoding for images presented during the reward anticipation period . On the other hand, recent evidence suggests that the VTA is under top-down control from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) . The dorsal ACC (dACC) supposedly integrates external and internal motivational factors, such as those related to rewards . Moreover, the dACC can modulate reward-related dopamine release by directly interacting with the VTA . Thus, the dACC could contribute to memory encoding by regulating VTA function based on current average reward levels. It is also important to note that the relationship between reward levels and memory might not be linear. In particular, increased levels of dopamine enhance memory encoding only up to a certain point, after which additional dopamine may become detrimental for memory encoding . Yet, it is currently unclear whether these effects of dopamine on memory formation relate to changes in VTA function and/or in other brain regions involved in memory formation and motivation, such as the HC and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). \n\nTo elucidate the neural underpinnings of average reward effects on memory encoding, here we combine model-based fMRI with a recently developed associative memory paradigm that allows control of immediate reward magnitude and average reward levels on a trial-wise basis during encoding . To test whether high levels of average reward impair (rather than promote) learning, we include trials that yield higher relative reward as compared with our previous study, in which we found a linear relationship between average reward and memory encoding . We predict that immediate reward magnitude and average reward levels during encoding engage brain regions involved in reward processing and motivation (i.e., the VTA and its downstream target the NAcc) and memory formation (i.e., the HC and the parahippocampal gyrus; PHG), and account for variance in subsequently tested memory performance. However, because the brain loci enabling a non-linear effect of dopamine on episodic memory formation are unclear, we make no specific predictions regarding a differential neuronal representation of linear versus nonlinear effects of immediate and average reward. \n\nIn brief, we show that immediate reward-feedback magnitude has a monotonically increasing influence on NAcc, VTA, and hippocampal activity during encoding, and enhances memory retention. Critically, average reward levels during encoding exert a nonlinear modulation (i.e., an inverted U-shape) on: (1) activity in the VTA, the HC, and the PHG, (2) functional connectivity between the dACC and the VTA, and (3) subsequently tested memory performance. By contrast, dACC activity negatively correlates with average reward levels. While the present study confirms a sustained influence of reward feedback on memory encoding, via its modulation of average reward levels and phasic responsivity of dopamine circuitry, these results also support the notion that dACC\u2013VTA interactions regulate motivated behavior. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Brief task description \n  \nDuring fMRI scanning, 34 participants performed an associative memory task consisting of one memory encoding session followed by a memory test session. In each trial of the encoding session, participants were presented with the face of a cartoon character and one pair of objects (Fig.\u00a0 ), and guessed which of the two objects the character preferred. Subsequent feedback indicated how much the character liked the selected object: very much (+5 feedback), moderately (+1 feedback), or disliked (\u22121 feedback; Fig.\u00a0 ). Participants were instructed to learn the preferences\u00a0that six different characters had\u00a0for ten different object pairs, because the memory for the preferences would later be tested. Unbeknownst to participants, the feedbacks were predetermined, such that two characters each received on average high, medium, or low levels of reward (as determined by the ratio between the number of +5 and +1 feedbacks, see Fig.\u00a0 ). In order to fully control the average level of reward, each character\u2013object pair was shown only once and all ten preferences for one character was encoded before the ten preferences for the next character was encoded, and so forth (i.e., 60 encoding trials in total). The memory test session was largely similar to the encoding session, but no feedback was provided and the order of character\u2013object pairs was pseudorandomized. Points corresponded to a monetary bonus provided at the end of the experiment (see \u201cMethods\u201d for further details).    Stimuli and behavioral results.  \n a   During both encoding and testing, each trial started with the presentation of a cartoon character together with two objects. During encoding trials, participants randomly selected one object and then received a feedback indicating how much the selected object was liked by the character (see   b  ).   c   During encoding, three different feedback values were presented indicating whether a selected object was disliked (magenta circle, \u22121), moderately liked (blue circle, +1), or very much liked (green circle, +5).   d   Average reward was the average of ten feedback values displayed for a given character. Two characters were associated with high (Hi) average reward (one +1, five +5s), two with medium (Me) average reward (three +1s, three +5s), and two with low (Lo) average reward (five +1s and one +5).   e   Memory performance (proportion correct) increased monotonically as a function of feedback value.   f  .

Performance was calculated as the proportion of correct selections of character\u2013object associations encoded during positive (+1, +5) feedback and correct rejections of associations encoded during negative (\u22121) feedback. Memory performance was analyzed for the different types of reward presented during the encoding, i.e., three levels of Feedback value (\u22121, +1, +5) and three levels of Average reward (Lo, Me, Hi). A linear mixed effects model with fixed effects Feedback value (\u22121, +1, +5) and Average reward (Lo, Me, Hi) and participant as random effect revealed a significant main effect of Feedback value [Fig.\u00a0 ;   F  (2, 288)\u2009=\u200917.905,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, ANOVA] because memory was better for character\u2013object associations encoded during +5 feedback [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: 0.739\u2009\u00b1\u20090.028] as compared with +1 feedback [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: 0.671\u2009\u00b1\u20090.019,   t  (32)\u2009=\u20092.545,   p  \u2009=\u20090.016,   d  \u2009=\u20090.490, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.014\u20130.122, paired   t  -test] and \u22121 feedback [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: 0.552\u2009\u00b1\u20090.025,   t  (32)\u2009=\u20095.728,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001,   d  \u2009=\u20091.214, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.120\u20130.253, paired   t  -test].

When tested separately, memory performance was above change (memory performance\u00a0>\u00a00.5) for all three types of feedback value [all three   p   values\u2009<\u20090.05, one-sample   t-  test]. \n\nThe main effect of Average reward was also significant [Fig.\u00a0 ;   F  (2,288)\u2009=\u20094.792,   p  \u2009=\u20090.009 ANOVA], with the highest memory performance for associations encoded during Me average reward [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: 0.688\u2009\u00b1\u20090.023], both as compared with Lo average reward [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: 0.623\u2009\u00b1\u20090.025,   t  (32)\u2009=\u20092.240,   p  \u2009=\u20090.032,   d  \u2009=\u20090.470, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.006\u20130.123, paired   t  -test], and Hi average reward [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: 0.620\u2009\u00b1\u20090.021,   t  (32)\u2009=\u20093.230,   p  \u2009=\u20090.003,   d  \u2009=\u20090.544, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.025\u20130.111, paired   t  -test]. There was no difference in memory performance between Lo and Hi average reward [  t  (32)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.138,   p  \u2009=\u20090.891,   d  \u2009=\u20090.027, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009\u22120.049\u20130.056, paired   t  -test]. The interaction between Feedback value and Average reward was not significant [  F  (4,288)\u2009=\u20091.008,   p  \u2009=\u20090.404, ANOVA], suggesting independent contributions of Feedback value and Average reward to memory formation. The main effects of Feedback value and Average reward remained significant when controlling for presentation order during encoding, presentation order during testing, and cartoon character identity (see Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Computational modeling \n  \nComputational modeling was used to provide a more fine-grained (i.e., trial-wise) description of the relationship between the different types of reward and memory formation. The fits of different computational models to behavior are displayed in Table\u00a0  (for full details of these models, see \u201cMethods\u201d). The best fit to behavior was provided by the   model, which assumes linear and quadratic influences from feedback value and average reward on memory formation, respectively [the average Akaike\u2019s information criterion (AIC) of this model was significantly smaller as compared with the average AIC of each of the other models, all   p   values\u2009<\u20090.05, paired   t  -tests]. The   model also provided the most parsimonious fit as compared with models fitting initial average reward levels and learning rates for each character separately (see Supplementary Note\u00a0 ).   \nModel fits. \n  \n C   ,C  ,  ,  ,  ,   ,v  , and   w   are parameters fitted to each individual\u2019s behavior. \n\n LLE  , negative log-likelihood estimate,   AIC  , Akaike\u2019s information criterion. \n\nThe model providing the most parsimonious fit to behavior, as indicated by significantly lower AIC values.

As expected, the highest and the smallest accumulated level of average reward were obtained in the Hi and Lo average reward categories, respectively (Fig.\u00a0 ). Figure\u00a0  illustrates the contribution of average reward levels to the encoding probability (  p  ).   p   increased with increasing levels of average reward, until the \u201coptimal\u201d level of average reward (  w  ), at which point additional levels of average reward reduced the encoding probability (Fig.\u00a0 ).    Computational model.  \n a  \u2013  d   illustrates how parameter values in the computational model derive from the behavioral data, here for one representative participant.   a   The average reward level ( , black line) tracks preceding feedback values as an exponential running average.

By contrast,   p   decreases whenever   becomes larger or smaller than   w  . To further illustrate the nonlinear contribution of   to   p  , the quadratic term   is displayed as a red line. White, gray, and black bars respectively illustrate the average   p   of the ten trials within each average reward category.   d   The average   p   across the average reward categories in (  c  ).   e   Across participants, the most parsimonious model indicates that the encoding probability   p   increases monotonically as a function of feedback value, but is nonlinearly modulated by average reward (  f  ).   g   On average the model predicts higher encoding probabilities for subsequent hits as compared with misses. ***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001, ns\u00a0not significant (i.e.,   p  \u2009>\u20090.05), indicates the   p   value for paired   t  -test. The horizontal lines in   e  ,   f  , and   g   indicate mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. \n  \n\nThe fit of the   model to behavioral data is displayed in Fig.\u00a0 , and shows the same significant effects as actual behavior (Fig.\u00a0 ; see Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). Of note, the level of average reward was not constrained to particular character identities, as the   model provided a better fit as compared with other models fitting (1) one baseline value of average reward which was reset whenever a new character was presented during encoding (see the   with   model), or (2) six different baseline levels of average reward (i.e., one for each character; see Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). Moreover, as would be expected, the   model predicted a higher encoding probability for trials subsequently classified as hits [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: 0.679\u2009\u00b1\u20090.018], as compared with misses [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: 0.574\u2009\u00b1\u20090.015,   t  (32)\u2009=\u20099.620,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001,   d  \u2009=\u20091.136, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.083\u20130.128, paired   t  -test]. Thus, the computational modeling approach also confirmed the hypothesized link between average reward and memory formation. \n\n\n### fMRI \n  \nTo determine the neuronal correlates of the different reward types during memory encoding, we combined fMRI data with trial-by-trial estimates of feedback values and average reward levels obtained from the   model. Because feedback values and average reward levels respectively impacted subsequent memory performance in a monotonically increasing and in a nonlinear fashion, we predicted that blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in reward- and memory-related brain regions should be similarly modulated by feedback value (i.e., monotonically increasing) and average reward (i.e., in an inverted U-shape fashion). \n\n\n### Positive correlations between BOLD and feedback values \n  \nAn increase in feedback value was reflected in increasing BOLD signal in the bilateral NAcc and in bilateral clusters extending into both the HC, the PHG, and the amygdala (Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ). However, given the well-known role of the VTA in reward processing and reward-related memory enhancements, it was surprising that no voxels with the VTA ROI tracked feedback value. To test whether this null-result may have been related to the selection of an anatomically defined VTA ROI, in combination with a strict requirement for the number of overlapping voxels across participants (50%; see \u201cMethods\u201d), we performed an additional analysis using a conservative ROI approach in a functionally defined VTA ROI. This VTA ROI was based on coordinates obtained from a previous study looking at reward-related memory enhancements , and we previously used this VTA ROI to test prediction error encoding in the dopaminergic midbrain . This supplementary analysis revealed that BOLD signal in this VTA ROI indeed correlated with feedback values (see Supplementary Note\u00a0 ).    Linear\u00a0BOLD signal increases as a function of feedback value.  \nBOLD signal in the bilateral NAcc ROI (  a  \u2013  c  ), and the HC/PHG ROIs (  d  \u2013  i  ) increased monotonically with feedback value. For display purposes, the violin plots show the average % signal change extracted from 3-mm spheres centered on peak voxel coordinates for each significant activation cluster.

However, a complimentary ROI analysis using a slightly different and functionally defined VTA ROI showed that VTA BOLD signal significantly tracked feedback value (see Supplementary Note 4 for details). \n\nThe amygdala was not part of the initial hypotheses, thus a stricter (Bonferroni-corrected) statistical threshold was applied in order to infer any involvement of the amygdala (  \u03b1  \u2009=\u20090.0167). \n  \n\nBecause feedback values modulated memory performance (Figs.\u00a0 f and  ), these results are in accordance with previous studies showing that reward-related effects on memory encoding are associated with increased activity in the NAcc, the VTA, the HC, and the PHG . Sagittal views of these activations are provided in the Supplementary Note\u00a0 . \n\n\n### Non linear modulation of BOLD by average reward levels \n  \nBOLD signal was modulated in an inverted U-shape fashion by average reward in the VTA, the amygdala, and in bilateral HC/PHG clusters (Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ). Because average reward levels contributed significantly to memory encoding (inverted U-shape; Figs.\u00a0 g and  ), this result suggests that average reward influences memory encoding by engaging dopaminergic memory circuitry. Sagittal views of these activations are provided in the Supplementary Note\u00a0 . Additional supplementary analyses, using a more conservative ROI approach, confirmed the robustness of the effect of average reward on VTA activity across different VTA ROIs and smoothing kernels (see Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). Of note, a separate fMRI analysis confirmed that average reward had no impact on BOLD signal during stimulus presentation (see Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). Moreover, the conjunction between the BOLD signal modulated by average reward (inverted U-shape) and feedback value revealed that no voxels in the a priori ROIs were significantly modulated by both feedback value and average reward (the conjunction was tested versus the \u201cconjunction null hypothesis\u201d  with an initial search threshold of   p  \u2009=\u20090.001).

It has recently been proposed that the dACC both keeps track of environmental states, such as current availability of reward or effort needed to obtain a goal, and regulates neuromodulatory systems (including dopaminergic reward signals in the VTA) in order to respond appropriately to changes in the environment . In the context of the present study, we predicted that the dACC would encode average reward levels (i.e., environmental tracking) and communicate the behavioral impact of average reward to the VTA (i.e., neuromodulatory regulation). Specifically, we investigated these hypotheses by testing for linear correlations between average reward and dACC BOLD signal and nonlinear modulations of VTA\u2013dACC functional connectivity by average reward. \n\nUsing a generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) approach (seed ROI defined as the voxels within the VTA ROI that correlated non linearly with average reward; Fig.\u00a0 ), we confirmed that the functional connectivity between the VTA and the dACC was modulated in a nonlinear fashion by average reward (inverted U-shape; Fig.\u00a0 ; peak MNI   x   y   z  \u2009=\u20093 35 13; T(32)\u2009=\u20093.751; pSVC\u2009=\u20090.037). Moreover, dACC BOLD signal significantly and linearly correlated with average reward levels (Fig.\u00a0 ; peak MNI   x   y   z  \u2009=\u20090 32 22; T(32)\u2009=\u20094.155; pSVC\u2009=\u20090.016).

T-statistics were obtained from   t  -tests. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe investigated the influence of reward feedback and average accumulated\u00a0reward on associative memory formation. Three different levels of feedback value (\u22121, +1, +5) and average reward (Lo, Me, Hi) during encoding were tested. Model-based fMRI was used to assess how memory performance related to trial-by-trial changes in neural activity under these reward regimes during encoding. \n\nMemory performance increased monotonically for character\u2013object associations encoded during \u22121, +1, and +5 feedbacks, respectively. This effect was mirrored by activity in the NAcc, the VTA, the HC, and the PHG at encoding. These memory effects primarily depended on the feedback value at encoding (and not the expected reward at memory recall) because associations encoded during +1 feedback were better remembered than those encoded during \u22121 feedback, although correctly remembering both types of trials in the memory test would yield +1 point. One plausible explanation for these results can be derived from studies showing that unexpected positive or negative feedbacks elicit phasic increases (bursts) or decreases (dips) in dopamine neuron activity, respectively . Dopamine neurons project to the NAcc, which is anatomically and functionally linked to the HC . Accordingly, differences in phasic dopamine neuron activity during encoding may explain why associations are better remembered following +1 feedback, as compared with \u22121 feedback (and similarly why +5 feedbacks caused even better memory performance) . The monotonically increasing relationship between three levels of feedback value and memory formation extends previous research showing better memory for information encoded during the presentation or expectation of binary (i.e., large versus small) rewards, with neural correlates overlapping those obtained in the present study . \n\nMoreover, our results support previous studies reporting better memory for information presented in association with feedback, such as positive versus negative feedback , larger feedback prediction errors , or the unsigned feedback prediction error . However, some\u00a0other studies report that memory was not modulated by feedback magnitude  or feedback prediction error , or was negatively influenced by the feedback prediction error . Unfortunately, these studies, although being just a handful, present a large variety in experimental parameters which may have contributed to these seemingly discrepant results. To name a few: encoding type (incidental versus intentional), memory type (associative versus recognition memory), encoding-testing delay period (short versus long), sleep\u00a0during the delay period (with versus without sleep), task relevance of memoranda, timing of stimuli, and reinforcement learning paradigm (Pavlovian versus instrumental). While the potential influence of these factors on reward-related memory have been discussed elsewhere , we note that many of the studies reporting a positive impact of feedback value on memory formation (including ours), presented the information to be remembered (i.e., the memoranda) in close temporal vicinity to the feedback , while those reporting no or a negative impact of feedback value presented the memoranda prior to the feedback . For example, Jang et al.  presented rewards either before memoranda (to induce reward anticipation), during memoranda (to elicit what the authors termed an \u201cimage prediction error\u201d), or after memoranda (to elicit a feedback prediction error). Strikingly, while neither the feedback prediction error nor the reward anticipation impacted on subsequent memory performance, the image prediction error, elicited by the presentation of memoranda, correlated positively with subsequent memory performance . Thus, reward delivery might influence memory encoding in a limited time window, perhaps constrained by the rapid phasic response of dopamine neurons to reward delivery (<500\u2009ms; ). Yet, because a few other studies showed that activating the reward system before and after memoranda also increased subsequent memory performance , further research needs to determine to what extent memory formation depends on the relative timing between memoranda and different aspects of reward, and how these relate to the different response profiles of the dopamine system, i.e., phasic bursts and dips, tonic activity, and sustained ramping responses . \n\nDuring memory encoding, activity in the VTA and brain regions implicated in memory formation (i.e., HC and PHG) was modulated by average reward in a nonlinear fashion (i.e., inverted U-shape). Memory performance (as tested in a subsequent memory test) showed the same (inverted U-shape) modulation by average reward, whereby intermediate levels of average reward yielded best memory retention. The finding that average reward modulates feedback-related neural activity in the VTA and the HC during encoding, with similar impact on subsequently tested memory performance, supports theories postulating that reward enhances memory formation via dopaminergic influences on HC plasticity . Yet, reward feedback induces rapid phasic bursting activity of dopamine neurons , while average reward is presumably encoded by slower changes in tonic dopamine levels . These seemingly discrepant findings can be reconciled by animal research showing that the overall phasic dopamine response scales with the number of \u201cactive\u201d dopamine neurons, while the number of active dopamine neurons is reflected in tonic dopamine levels . \n\nNotably, this interpretation suggests that the HC loci for the effects of feedback value and immediate reward on memory encoding should overlap, yet a conjunction analysis revealed no significant voxel overlap between the different contrasts. Seen through the lenses of phasic and tonic dopamine, such a result has been predicted by previous literature based on notions that different types of dopamine receptors show different degrees of affinity and are heterogeneously distributed throughout the HC. For example, Shohamy and Adcock  theorized that tonic dopamine acts on D5 receptors, which are mainly extrasynaptic, while phasic dopamine is restricted to engage other types of dopamine receptors located within a synapse. Moreover, Edelmann and Lessman  suggested that tonic dopamine firing only activates high-affinity D2 receptors, while phasic dopamine firing additionally and briefly activates low-affinity D1 and D5 receptors. In addition, Rosen et al.  showed that the flow of information between regions of the HC may be controlled by the dopaminergic midbrain. Specifically, optogenetic stimulation of the VTA that simulated tonic/phasic mode of dopamine release caused inhibition/facilitation of postsynaptic potentials in CA1 pyramidal neurons following Schaffer collateral stimulation, thus suggesting that information flow within the HC is determined by the current mode of dopamine activity. Because this effect was specifically dependent on D4 receptors, the impact of tonic/phasic dopamine activity might be most pronounced in regions of the HC with a higher density of D4 receptors. In summary, phasic and tonic dopamine activity may engage different regions of the HC by acting upon different dopamine receptors spread heterogeneously across the HC. \n\nBeyond average reward, a sustained \u201cramping\u201d dopaminergic response, consistent with tonic dopamine activity, can be triggered by the anticipation of uncertain rewards . One study showed that memory for images presented during periods of uncertain reward anticipation was enhanced when tested after both short and long delays . Another study reported better memory, as tested after a short delay only, for items encoded during high-risk (versus low-risk) contexts, where risk was determined by the variance of the reward magnitude . While the authors speculated that differences in arousal mediated the effect of risk on memory encoding, it is tempting to propose that tonic dopamine activity, induced by uncertain reward anticipation (caused by a large variance in reward magnitude), may also have contributed to this effect. Future neuroimaging studies need to elucidate whether the effects of average reward, uncertain reward anticipation, and risk on memory encoding are related to similar engagement of the VTA. \n\nRegarding the nonlinearity of the modulation by average reward in the present study, it was previously shown in humans that slightly increased levels of dopamine (achieved via L-DOPA administration) enhanced memory formation, while excessive dopamine levels had a detrimental impact (i.e., inverted U-shape , see also ). By increasing the overall level of average reward, as compared with our previous study , we show that elevated levels of average reward also impede memory formation. What could explain this nonlinear influence of average reward (and dopamine) on memory formation? Dopamine is important for optimizing energy expenditure , and tonic dopamine may signal opportunity costs , the value of work , or effort . Accordingly, low average reward (e.g., food scarcity during winter) promotes sloth because the value of work is low, while increasing levels of average reward (e.g., food availability during spring) promotes action by signaling an increased value of work. However, when rewards are bountiful (e.g., a domestic animal\u2019s constant access to food), the value of work is constant and hard work is unnecessary. It therefore seems unreasonable that average reward has a monotonously increasing impact on behavior. Instead, as detailed next, we propose that the behavioral impact of average reward is first determined by the dACC, a brain region involved in the integration of different motivational factors, and then actuated via dACC\u2013VTA interactions. \n\nThe dACC integrates different types of motivational information, such as reward, effort, and punishment , and determines behavior via top-down influences on the VTA . The VTA is well known for its role in enabling motivated behavior . A recent elaborate model suggests that dACC function can be described by two integrated modules . One module monitors environmental states, such as the effort, risk, or reward associated with obtaining a goal, and selects appropriate actions, while the other module regulates the release of neuromodulators, including reward-related dopamine release from the VTA. In line with this model, we show a monotonic relationship between average reward levels and dACC BOLD (in accordance with a dACC monitoring function), and a nonlinear modulation by average reward on VTA\u2013dACC functional connectivity (which is compatible with a dACC neuromodulatory regulation function). VTA\u2013dACC functional connectivity was highest for the intermediate level of average reward during encoding, as was activity in the VTA and subsequently tested memory performance. Of note, dACC activity is increased by factors that reduce the expected value of future rewards, including effort needed to obtain the rewards, uncertainty associated with the reward outcome, error likelihood, and perceived decision difficulty (for reviews, see refs.\u2009 ). Thus, because average reward levels estimate the current likelihood of receiving a large reward, dACC activity should be negatively correlated with average reward levels, a prediction corroborated by the present results. Given our results in combination with previous research, we propose that the dACC encodes average reward, determines its behavioral impact (after considering other concurrent factors), and then transmits this information to memory circuitry via the VTA. \n\nThe neuronal mechanisms in the VTA that are impacted by a dACC\u2013VTA modulation are largely unknown, yet the ACC projects directly to VTA dopamine neurons via glutamatergic projections , and glutamatergic afferents to dopamine neurons supposedly control transitions between phasic and tonic activity . Moreover, shifting the balance between excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic inputs to the VTA increased the spontaneous activation of dopamine neurons , and glutamate iontophoresis increased both the baseline firing rate and the burst firing frequency of dopamine neurons . Thus, one plausible mechanism, which certainly needs empirical confirmation, is that top-down control of the VTA from the dACC occurs via glutamatergic inputs to the VTA that alter tonic dopamine activity by changing the number of spontaneously \u201cactive\u201d dopamine neurons (i.e., neurons that may elicit phasic burst firing), and thus also the overall phasic dopamine response . \n\nAlthough not part of our initial hypotheses, post-hoc tests indicated that feedback-related activation clusters (both monotonically increasing by feedback value and nonlinearly modulated by average reward) extended into the bilateral amygdala. Previous studies looking at reward-related memory enhancements have not reported the involvement of the amygdala , which in some cases may be due to highly constrained ROI analyses . However, amygdala\u2019s involvement in reward-related memory encoding is not surprising, given its role in emotion-related memory enhancement. For example, the amygdala was activated bilaterally when participants viewed pleasant and unpleasant images, and the degree of amygdala activation correlated with subsequently tested memory for these images . Moreover, the amygdala modulates the formation of hippocampal-dependent episodic memories , possibly via its ability to encode different aspects of emotionality, such as valence and salience . Because the amygdala is interconnected with both the HC and the VTA , amygdala modulation of memory encoding in the present study could be accomplished in (at least) two different ways. First, via direct influences on hippocampal plasticity , or by regulating VTA dopamine neurons that project to the HC, for example by transmitting motivational salience signals to the VTA . Future research should further clarify the role of the amygdala in reward-related memory enhancements. \n\nThe VTA encoded both feedback value and average reward while the NAcc only encoded feedback value. At first glance, the divergent encoding of average reward in the VTA and the NAcc is surprising given the extensive dopaminergic input from the VTA to the NAcc , in combination with results showing co-activation of the VTA and the NAcc in the context of prediction errors  and during rest . However, the NAcc receives input from many brain regions besides the VTA , and may therefore be influenced by information beyond that transmitted by VTA dopamine neurons . In line with this notion, one study alternated visual and auditory cues as being the relevant feature to predict upcoming rewards, and showed that the ventral striatum (of which the NAcc is part) tracked the value of the currently relevant stimulus only, and was activated by the correctness of the response rather than the outcome\u2019s value . In a related study, participants learned the timing of reward outcomes rather than their magnitudes, and while the VTA tracked parameters related to both reward magnitudes and timings, the ventral striatum only tracked the reward timings, i.e., the task-relevant parameter. Similarly, participants in the present study learned the value of character\u2013object associations, and this task-relevant feature was tracked by both the VTA and the NAcc. By contrast, the task-irrelevant average reward level was only tracked by the VTA. Thus, the ventral striatum/NAcc may update the features of the environment that are most relevant to drive behavior , a specific role that is not shared by the VTA. \n\nSome limitations of the present study needs to be acknowledged. First, we show that average reward modulates the encoding of character\u2013object associations, yet it remains unknown to what extent average reward modulates the encoding of other types of information within a trial, such as memory for a particular character identity or objects. While the present study was not designed to test memory for individual stimuli, the experimental paradigm could easily be adapted to test such aspects by, for example, replacing the associative memory test with a stimulus recognition test. Another limitation, shared by many studies on human reward-related memory modulation, is that memory was tested after a relatively short delay period (i.e., 20\u2009min after encoding in the present study). Thus, it remains unknown whether and how feedback value and average reward in the present study may modulate subsequent dopamine-dependent consolidation processes. Dopamine is believed to enable consolidation of long-term potentiation (LTP) , a cellular model of long-term memory . In brief, LTP posits that memories are initially encoded by changes in synaptic strengths following synaptic activation (early LTP), and that these changes, and thus also the memories they encode, quickly vanish unless the synapses undergo a stabilization/consolidation process that involves the synthesis of plasticity-related proteins (late LTP) . While experimental evidence suggests that dopamine is important for both early and late LTP, it may be particularly relevant for late LTP. For example, administering dopamine antagonists before learning in a one-trial reward learning task impeded memory when tested after 24\u2009h, but not when tested after 30\u2009min . Accordingly, the impact of dopamine-releasing events during encoding, such as reward, may be particularly evident when memory is tested after long delays (i.e., after late LTP has occurred). Some human research support this notion by showing that reward-related enhancements of memory emerged only when tested after long delays (>24\u2009h)  or after a nap  (which may allow for dopamine-related consolidation processes ). Yet, other studies report reward-related memory modulations when tested both after short (<30\u2009min) and long delays , or when tested after short delays only . The latter results suggest that reward-related memory modulations do not always pertain to consolidation processes, but may also act directly on the encoding of a memory, a notion which is in line with the present results. Yet, future studies need to address the impact of average reward on later consolidation processes. A final limitation is that the current fMRI approach cannot address what low-level mechanism(s) could explain reward influences on memory encoding. Some experimental evidence suggests that dopamine lowers thresholds for LTP induction . Another interesting option relates to the notion of a three-factor rule of synaptic plasticity . In brief, this theory posits that co-activation of pre- and postsynaptic neurons sets an eligibility trace that allows synaptic change, but only in the presence of a third modulating factor. This modulatory factor may be dopamine, but could also be any other neuromodulator known to impact learning, such as acetylcholine, noreprinephrine, or serotonin. This rule explains rapid behavioral change without the need for consolidation, and is supported by recent experimental evidence obtained in the striatum, the prefrontal and visual cortices, and in the HC (see Gerstner et al.  for a recent review). Other mechanisms have also been suggested, i.e., see Box 5 of Lisman et al.  and Shohamy and Adcock . \n\nTo summarize, we show that reward feedback exhibits (1) an immediate and positive effect on memory encoding that engages the NAcc, the VTA, and hippocampal brain regions, and (2) a more sustained non-linear effect via its integration into average reward levels, which in turn modulates neural responses within the VTA\u2013HC loop, as determined by the dACC and its interactions with the VTA. These results demonstrate that the accumulation of reward contributes to memory encoding success, with intermediate levels of average reward providing the most beneficial setting for memory encoding. The impact of average reward across cognitive domains, and its interaction with inter-individual differences related to dopamine functionality, remain to be investigated. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nFunctional MRI data were acquired while participants performed an associative memory task consisting of one memory encoding session and one memory test session. We designed different computational models explaining how immediate feedback value and average reward might differentially impact memory formation, and then fitted them to memory performance during the test session. The parameters derived from the most parsimonious model were then combined with fMRI data to uncover brain activity that correlated with the different dimensions of reward delivery during memory encoding. Specific details about the experimental procedures are presented below. \n\n### Participants \n  \nAfter having provided written and informed consent according to the ethical regulations of the Geneva University Hospital, 34 participants joined the experiment. All participants were right-handed, native French speakers, and without any previous history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Data from one participant had to be excluded due to him/her falling asleep during the memory test phase. Thus, data from the remaining 33 participants were included in the subsequent analyses (15 females; average age\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: 25.242\u2009\u00b1\u20090.874). \n\n\n### Associative memory task \n  \nEach participant performed an associative memory task consisting of one memory encoding session (9\u2009min) and one memory test session (9\u2009min). Both sessions were performed during fMRI scanning and were separated by 20\u2009min. \n\nMemory encoding session: In each trial during the encoding session, a fixation cross was first presented for 3\u2009s, followed by the face of a cartoon character presented together with a pair of objects  for 3.5\u2009s (Fig.\u00a0 ). Participants were instructed that the character moderately liked or very much liked one object in each pair, while disliking the other object. Participants had to indicate which object they thought that the character liked (moderately or very much) by pressing one of two buttons with the right hand. A feedback display, consisting of a number enclosed by a colored circle was then presented for 1\u2009s (Fig.\u00a0 ). The feedback indicated whether the character moderately liked (+1, blue circle), very much liked (+5, green circle), or disliked (\u22121, magenta circle) the selected object (Fig.\u00a0 ). Besides informing about a preference, the feedback also indicated how many points each selection was worth. The feedback was presented 4\u2009s after the onset of the face/objects display. Participants were instructed that they could gain additional points by correctly remembering each character\u2013object preference for a subsequent memory test phase (see below), and that the points would be converted into a monetary bonus at the end of the experiment. \n\nCritically, the feedback was manipulated to yield different average reward levels for the six different characters presented during the memory encoding session. Specifically, while all characters received four \u22121 feedbacks, two characters associated with high (Hi) average reward received one +1 feedback and five +5 feedbacks, two characters associated with medium (Me) average reward received three +1 feedbacks and three +5 feedbacks, while two characters associated with low (Lo) average reward received five +1 feedbacks and only one +5 feedback (Fig.\u00a0 ). Each of the six characters was presented together with each of ten possible object pairs (i.e., the object pairs were constant across the experiment and participants), for a total of 60 trials. All ten character\u2013object associations were encoded for one character (i.e., ten trials), before the same object pairs were presented together with the next character, and so forth for all six characters. For each participant, the characters were randomly assigned to one of the different average reward levels (i.e., either Lo, Me, or Hi). \n\nTest session: During the test session, participants were presented with the same characters and same object pairs, and were instructed to recall and select the character's\u00a0preferred object in each object pair. Selecting an object previously associated with positive feedback (i.e., +1 or +5) earned the corresponding points (i.e., +1 and +5), while rejecting an object associated with \u22121 feedback earned +1 points. Note that correctly remembering associations encoded during +1 feedback or those encoded during \u22121 feedback (correct rejection) would yield +1 point in both cases. Participants lost 1 point if they selected a disliked object, i.e., either by selecting a previously disliked object or by not selecting a previously rewarded object. Testing trials were identical to encoding trials (Fig.\u00a0 ), except that no feedback was provided. The order of characters, object pairs, and the side of object presentation within a pair, were pseudorandomized. First, each character (each with the 10 corresponding object pairs, i.e., 10 trials) was presented once before any other character was repeated. Second, the order of the ten object pairs was randomized for each character. Third, the side of object presentation within a pair was reversed (with respect to the side of presentation during the encoding session) for half of the object pairs for each character. \n\nProcedure: To get familiar with the task, participants first trained the task outside the MRI scanner. Six character\u2013object associations were encoded for one character and then tested after a delay of ~5\u2009min. Neither the character nor the trained object pairs were subsequently used during the main experiment. Participants then performed the associative memory task inside the MRI scanner, as described previously (i.e., one encoding session and one test session). \n\nStatistical analysis: Memory performance during the test session was calculated as the proportion of correct responses: i.e., selection of objects that had been rewarded for a given character during the encoding phase (+1, +5 feedbacks), or rejections of objects classified as \u201cdisliked\u201d by a given character (\u22121 feedback). We computed the number of correct responses for each combination of immediate feedback value (+1, +5, and \u22121) and average reward (Lo, Me, and Hi). \n\nThe data were analyzed using linear mixed models of the following form:  , where   Y   represents a vector of values of the dependent measure of interest for the   i  th participant,   X   represents a matrix of   p   predictors (independent variables) for the   i  th participant,   B   represents a vector of   p   fixed effect beta weight estimates for each predictor in   X  ,   Z   represents a matrix of   q   random effect predictors,   b   represents a vector of   q   random effect estimates, and   e   represents a vector of the model fit error, representing the discrepancy between the model prediction for each observation from the ith participant and the actual value of that observation. For behavior and modeling data, two categorical predictors with three levels each were used: Feedback value (\u22121, +1, and +5) and Average reward (Lo, Me, and Hi) along with their interaction. Moreover, each participant was treated as a random variable, i.e., the matrix   Z   contained one column for each participant pertaining to that participant\u2019s random effect estimate   b  . \n\nANOVA was initially used to analyze the results, and significant effects were further investigated using two-tailed paired   t-  tests. Of note, while linear mixed models are in many ways superior compared with alternative approaches , the calculation of standard effect sizes for these models is still heavily debated . For this reason, we restricted the reporting of standardized effects sizes to the difference between means, which was calculated using Cohen\u2019s   d  : \n\n\n### Computational approach \n  \nTo provide a more fine-grained (i.e., trial-wise) analysis of behavior and fMRI data, we created and confronted different computational models for successful memory formation depending on different types of reward available at the time of encoding. As such, the average reward   is calculated using an exponential running average  while the feedback values (fb) are the actual reward values (i.e., \u22121, +1, or +5): where   v   is a learning rate which determines the integration rate of recent rewards into the overall estimate of current average reward. The probability   p   of successfully encoding information presented in a trial   t   is described by a logistic function:  R  (  t  ) is defined in different models based on previous data linking reward and dopamine to memory formation, as described next. \n\nA \u201cnull\u201d-model assumes no influence of reward on memory performance: A second model accounts for the impact of feedback value on memory formation (  C  ): A third model accounts for the hypothesized impact of average reward on memory formation  : A fourth model accounts for independent additive contributions from reward magnitude and average reward: A fifth model also includes their interaction  : A sixth model accounts for the nonlinear modulation of memory formation by increasing average reward  , inspired by the notion that average reward is encoded by tonic dopamine  and the nonlinear modulation of episodic memory formation by increased dopamine levels: where   w   indicates the \u201coptimal\u201d level of average reward, i.e., the point where lower or higher levels of average reward are detrimental to memory encoding. \n\nA seventh and final model is similar to the sixth model, but presumes that average reward levels are calculated for each cartoon character independently. To account for this possibility, an initial level of average reward   was therefore fitted across cartoon characters. \n\n C  ,  ,  , and   regulate the modulation of overall reward levels by reward magnitude, average reward, their interaction, and the nonlinear modulation by average reward, respectively. The free parameters   were fitted to each participant\u2019s data through maximum likelihood estimation, i.e., by minimizing the negative log-likelihood estimation function (LLE) for logistic regression: where   y  (  t  ) is the observed outcome (i.e., hit/miss) in each trial   t  . To validate and confront these models, their fit to behavioral data were compared using AIC  which accounts for different numbers of fitted variables: \n\n\n### MRI data \n  \nImage acquisition: MRI images were acquired using a 3T whole body MRI scanner (Trio TIM, Siemens, Germany) with a 12-channel head coil. Standard structural images were acquired with a T1 weighted 3D sequence (MPRAGE, TR/TI/TE\u2009=\u20091900/900/2.27\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u20099\u00b0, voxel dimensions\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm isotropic, 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009192 voxels). Proton density (PD) structural images were acquired with a turbo spin echo sequence (TR/TE\u2009=\u20096000/8.4\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u2009149\u00b0, voxel dimensions\u2009=\u20090.8\u2009\u00d7\u20090.8\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm, 205\u2009\u00d7\u2009205\u2009\u00d7\u200960 voxels). The PD scan was used to confirm the location of VTA activation, as it allows the identification of the substantia nigra, a brain region located just laterally to the VTA . The acquisition volume was oriented in order to scan the brain from the lower part of the pons to the top of the thalamus. Functional images were acquired with a susceptibility weighted EPI sequence (TR/TE\u2009=\u20092100/30\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200980\u00b0, voxel dimensions\u2009=\u20093.2\u2009mm isotropic, 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200936 voxels). \n\nMRI data analysis: Functional MRI data were preprocessed and then analyzed using the general linear model for event-related designs in SPM8 (Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK;  ). During preprocessing, all functional volumes were realigned to the mean image, co-registered to the structural T1 image, corrected for slice timing, normalized to the MNI EPI-template (via a 12 parameter affine transformation model with trilinear interpolation), and smoothed using an 8\u2009mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Statistical analyses were performed on a voxelwise basis across the whole-brain. At the first-level analysis, individual events were modeled by a standard synthetic hemodynamic response function (HRF) and six rigid-body realignment parameters were included as nuisance covariates when estimating statistical maps. Contrasts (see below) were then calculated and the contrast images entered into second-level   t   tests implemented in SPM. \n\nParametric modulation by model-derived reward parameters: By fitting computational models to memory performance from the test session, we obtained parameters that best explained how changes in feedback value and average reward during memory encoding influenced subsequent memory performance . Combining fitted model parameters with fMRI data, we could then trace back the neural correlates of those distinct dimensions of reward (that we manipulated in the task) during associative memory encoding. \n\nTo this end, we created an event-related design that included three event-types modeled as stick functions (i.e., with a 0 duration) that were respectively time-locked to the onset of the display of character/object pairs, the button press of the response, and the feedback in each trial. We then added trial-by-trial estimates of model-derived reward parameters, i.e., feedback values (i.e., \u22121, +1, and +5) and average reward levels (calculated as an exponential running average of feedback values), as parametric modulators to the feedback onset times. To disentangle neural activity related to different parametric modulators, the vectors containing respective parametric modulator were orthogonalized. This process allows studying the neural correlates of one parametric modulator independently of another . \n\nFunctional connectivity analysis of VTA\u2013ACC interactions:\u00a0For the connectivity analysis, we used the gPPI approach which has the benefit of accommodating multiple task conditions, including parametric modulators, in the same connectivity model . Physiological variables were created by extracting the deconvolved times series from each seed ROI. Psychological regressors were created by convolving each onset regressor and parametric modulator with the canonical HRF. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) terms (which allow the identification of voxels showing task-dependent covariation with the seed ROIs) were created by multiplying the time series from the psychological regressors with the physiological variable. All of the above was performed for each participant separately, and individual gPPI models were created by including the corresponding physiological variables, the psychological regressors, and the PPI terms. \n\nRegions of interest (ROIs): The selection of a priori ROIs used for small volume corrections (SVCs) were guided by previous literature on reward-related memory enhancements , reporting the involvement of memory-related brain structures such as the HC and the PHG, as well as structures coding for reward, such as the NAcc, the VTA, and the dACC. \n\nROIs for the NAcc, HC, and the PHG were obtained from the WFU toolbox . The VTA ROI was obtained from a recently published probabilistic atlas of the VTA, by including voxels identified as being part of the VTA in 50% of participants . The dACC ROI was defined by limiting the ACC ROI of the WFU toolbox to   z  \u2009>\u2009+12 and   y  \u2009>\u2009+16 . A \u201creward mask\u201d was created by combining the NAcc and VTA ROIs, while a \u201cmemory mask\u201d was created by combining the HC and the PHG ROIs. Both of these masks were used to test the parametric modulation by feedback value and average reward. By contrast, the dACC ROI was only used to test specific hypotheses related to VTA\u2013dACC interactions. For visualization purposes, an amygdala ROI obtained from the WFU toolbox was included in some of the figures. \n\nAdditional post-hoc analyses tested the involvement of the amygdala by using SVCs on a ROI mask of the bilateral amygdala obtained from the SPM Anatomy Toolbox Version 3.0 (all sub-regions of the amygdala included in the mask) . \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nThe obtained results are displayed using a threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 and a minimum cluster size of ten contiguous voxels, unless otherwise reported. SVCs using a threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 family-wise error rate (FWER) for multiple comparisons were obtained using a priori ROI masks reported above. Bonferroni-corrected statistical thresholds were applied to two post-hoc tests that investigated the involvement of the amygdala. Specifically, because two post-hoc tests were performed, the statistical threshold was corrected to 0.017 (0.05/3) for these tests. Conditions were compared using paired   t  -tests, as implemented in SPM. \n\nFor display purposes, the average brain activity were extracted from 3-mm spheres centered on peak voxels within significant clusters of activation and shown as insets. While the feedback values were constant (\u22121, +1, and +5), average reward levels changed continuously between trials. For this reason, we calculated and displayed the average brain activity within three equally sized bins of average reward levels, i.e., the 0\u201333rd percentiles, 34\u201366th percentiles, and 67\u2212100th percentiles. \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0  linked to this article. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n

However, it is unclear whether and how brain networks measured during the resting-state exhibit comparable properties to brain networks during task performance. In the present study, we investigated meta-analytic coactivation patterns among brain regions based upon published neuroimaging studies, and compared the coactivation network configurations with those in the resting-state network. The strength of resting-state functional connectivity between two regions were strongly correlated with the coactivation strength. However, the coactivation network showed greater global efficiency, smaller mean clustering coefficient, and lower modularity compared with the resting-state network, which suggest a more efficient global information transmission and between system integrations during task performing. Hub shifts were also observed within the thalamus and the left inferior temporal cortex. The thalamus and the left inferior temporal cortex exhibited higher and lower degrees, respectively in the coactivation network compared with the resting-state network. These results shed light regarding the reconfiguration of the brain networks between task and resting-state conditions, and highlight the role of the thalamus in change of network configurations in task vs. rest. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe human brain exhibits organized spontaneous fluctuations in the resting-state (Biswal et al.,  ), enabling researchers to study large-scale brain segregations and integrations (Bullmore and Sporns,  ,  ; Menon and Uddin,  ). The spontaneous fluctuations reveal high synchronization between brain regions in the same brain system (Cordes et al.,  ; Greicius et al.,  ), and are relatively independent between different brain systems (Beckmann et al.,  ; Biswal et al.,  ). The whole brain segregation and integration can also be studied using graph theory based analysis (Bullmore and Sporns,  ; Wang et al.,  ). For example, the brain network in the resting-state revealed modular structures, small world and scale free properties (Salvador et al.,  ; Achard et al.,  ; Achard and Bullmore,  ; Nakamura et al.,  ; Yan and He,  ). \n\nDespite the growing popularity of resting-state fMRI to study brain functions, studies have yet to address a fundamental question regarding whether the brain at resting-state is comparable to the brain during task performing. Given that the evoked cerebral blood flow by different tasks account for less than 5% of the resting-state cerebral blood flow (Raichle,  ), the resting-state brain already represents a large proportion of hemodynamic information which may reflect brain maintenance. Studies have also shown that task-related coactivation patterns correspond well with the brain systems that are measured during the resting-state (Toro et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ). However, based on the economic theory of brain network organization, the brain network should be in an energy saving mode during the resting-state, while exhibiting dynamic network reconfiguration in the presence of a task demand to facilitate global and between systems information transmissions (Bullmore and Sporns,  ). We predict that even though the connectivity in task conditions and the resting-state may be similar, substantial differences of network configurations may take place to support different task demands. \n\nChanges in connectivity modulated by task are important to understand brain integration (Friston,  ). Specific connections have been shown to be modulated by specific tasks (McLntosh and Gonzalez-Lima,  ; McIntosh et al.,  ; B\u00fcchel and Friston,  ; Rao et al.,  ). However, the modulations of connectivity are task specific, and it is difficult to modulate the whole brain network using a specific task. Thus, we adopted the same approach as Toro et al., and Smith et al. to examine task activations or group differences and their corresponding coactivation pattern across the whole brain (Toro et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ). Specifically, we constructed brain networks comprised of 140 regions of interest (ROIs) from the whole brain based on both meta-analytic coactivation patterns (Yarkoni et al.,  ) and resting-state correlations of fMRI signals (Biswal et al.,  ). The online database Neurosynth ( ) was used to extract coactivation information, which contained 47,493 activations from 4393 studies (Yarkoni et al.,  ). We first asked whether the strength of coactivation between a pair of ROIs was correlated with their resting-state correlations. We then compared different network properties based on graph theory between the two brain networks (Bullmore and Sporns,  ), including the small-worldness (Watts and Strogatz,  ), modularity (Newman,  ), and hub distributions. We hypothesized that the brain when performing tasks will be more integrated and thus exhibit higher global efficiency and reduced modularity compared with the resting-state brain. In addition, we hypothesized that the brain hubs may shift from the default mode network (DMN) (Raichle et al.,  ; Greicius et al.,  ) regions to other brain regions that are critical during task executions. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Regions of interest \n  \nOne hundred and sixty functionally defined ROIs from Dosenbach et al. were adopted in the present analysis (Dosenbach et al.,  ). Twenty-four ROIs were removed because they were outside the Neurosynth mask. We included four more ROIs that were not represented within the 136 ROIs (Sabatinelli et al.,  ): the right amygdala (Montreal Neurological Institute, MNI, coordinates: 20, \u22124, \u221215), the left amygdala (\u221220, \u22126, \u221215), the right parahippocampus (14, \u221233, \u22127), and the left parahippocampus (\u221220, \u221233, \u22124). A total of 140 ROIs were used in the present study to construct brain networks (supplementary Table  ). \n\n\n### Coactivation network \n  \nThe online database, Neurosynth, was used to construct the coactivation network (Yarkoni et al.,  ). The database search was conducted in November, 2012 when the database had 4393 studies and 47,493 activations. For each of the 140 ROIs, Neurosynth identified all the papers in the database that reported coordinates within 10 mm from the ROI center, and exported a whole brain z-score map representing the likelihood that a voxel coactivated with the given ROI (Yarkoni et al.,  ). The images were thresholded using a false discovery rate (FDR) criterion of   p   < 0.05. Thus, the Neurosynth search of all the ROIs resulted in 140 coactivation maps. \n\nOne hundred and forty spherical ROIs were defined using radii of 10 mm. The coactivation values of 140 ROIs were extracted from 140 coactivation maps, which resulted in a 140 \u00d7 140 matrix. Each row of the matrix represented the coactivation values of a given ROI with the other ROIs. Because the number of papers that was returned by each ROI inquiry was different, the coactivation values from different ROI inquiry may be biased. Therefore, we normalized each row by dividing the value from the ROI corresponding to that row, so that the diagonal values of the matrix were equaled to one. In addition, since the distribution of the coactivation values are skewed, all the values of the matrix were added by one, and were logarithmically transformed to facilitate a normal distribution. Finally, because the coactivation likelihood of region A with region B and the coactivation likelihood of region B with region A are generally similar but have slightly different values, the matrix was transposed, and averaged with the original matrix to create a symmetrical coactivation matrix. \n\n\n### Resting-state network \n  \nWe analyzed a resting-state fMRI data set to construct a resting-state network to compare with the coactivation network. The Oulu dataset from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project was used (Biswal et al.,  ). This dataset originally contains 103 subjects. One subject's data was discarded because of large head motion (greater than 3 mm). Thus 102 subjects' data were included in the current analysis (36M/66F). The mean age was 21.5 years (range from 20 to 23 years). Two hundred and forty-five resting-state functional images were acquired for each subject (  TR   = 1.8 s, 28 slices). High resolution anatomical image was also acquired for each subject using MPRAGE sequence (Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo). More information for the data can be found at  . To rule out the possibility that the current results are due to sample bias of the resting-state dataset, we have conducted a separate analysis using another resting-state dataset, i.e., the Nathan Kline Institute (NKI) / Rockland Sample ( ). Data analyses were identical to the Oulu dataset. Detailed methods and results of NKI dataset are reported in the supplementary material section. \n\nFunctional MRI images were processed using the SPM8 toolbox ( ) under the MATLAB7.7 environment ( ). First, the MPRAGE anatomical image for each subject was segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using the new segment routine in SPM8. The deformation field maps were also obtained in this step to later normalize the functional images. For each subject, the first five images of the fMRI images were discarded, resulting in 240 images per subject. The functional images were then motion corrected using the realign function. One subject's data were discarded after this step because the head motion was greater than 3 mm, resulting in 102 subjects in total. Next, the functional images were coregistered to the subjects' own anatomical images. Then, the deformation field map obtained from new segmentation step was applied to the functional images to normalize them into the standard MNI space. \n\nOne hundred and forty times series from the corresponding ROIs were extracted for each of the subjects. Six head motion parameters and their first order derivatives, first five eigenvectors from signals within WM masks, and first five eigenvectors from signals within CSF masks were regressed out using linear regression (n,  ). No global signal regression was applied. Next, the time series were temporally filtered using a band-pass filter of 0.01\u20130.1 Hz. For each subject, a 140 \u00d7 140 correlation matrix was calculated using Kendall's rank correlation to minimize spurs correlations due to noises. The correlation matrices were transformed into Fisher's z, and averaged across subjects. Finally, the mean Fishers' z matrix was transformed back to correlation matrix using Fisher's inverse transform. \n\n\n### Network analysis \n  \nBecause the values in the coactivation matrix and the resting-state correlation matrix are essentially different, network sparsity thresholds were used to keep the number of edges of the two networks the same when comparing the two networks. The sparsity range was set between 6 and 40% with an increment of 1%. This range was used because typical sparsity of human neuron network is between this range, and the large scale brain networks revealed small world properties within this range (Achard and Bullmore,  ; He et al.,  ). After thresholding, all the networks were binary (unweighted) undirected networks. \n\nWe first compared the two networks in terms of small world properties (global efficiency and mean clustering coefficient) and modularity. The global efficiency characterizes how efficient the whole brain network integrates information, and the mean clustering coefficient characterizes how efficient the information flows around local nodes (Watts and Strogatz,  ). Modularity, also known as Newman's Q, characterizes the extent the whole brain network can be divided into sub-communities (Newman,  ). The global efficiency, mean clustering coefficient, and modularity were calculated for the two networks at each sparsity level using the brain connectivity toolbox (Rubinov and Sporns,  ). As a reference, random networks were generated 1000 times at each sparsity level. The three parameters were also calculated for the random networks, and were averaged across the 1000 random networks. \n\nTo determine the statistical significance, we created a null distribution of network differences by randomly shuffling the two networks 1000 times and calculating their differences of network properties for 1000 random networks. Specifically, at each sparsity level, we first identified edges that were different between the two networks. Next, we randomly assigned 50% of these different edges from the coactivation network to the resting-state network, and vice versa, resulting in two new mixed networks. We then calculated the three network parameters, i.e., the global efficiency, mean clustering coefficient and modularity, for the two mixed networks and obtained their differences between the two networks. The randomizations were performed 1000 times for each sparsity level to obtain a difference distribution. The difference of the three parameters between the coactivation network and the resting-state network were then compared with the randomized distribution to determine statistical significances. A critical threshold of   p   < 0.001 was used. \n\nTo demonstrate modular structures of the coactivation and the resting-state network, we thresholded the two networks at a sparsity level of 20%, and entered the two unweighted undirected networks into Gephi ( ) to determine their modular structures using the algorithm by Blondel et al. ( ). The two networks and their modular structures were rendered into a 2D surface using the Fruchterman\u2013Reingold Algorithm (Fruchterman and Reingold,  ). \n\nWe then examined whether the two networks displayed similar hub distribution (Achard et al.,  ). In the present study, we simply defined the importance of each node by calculating the number of edges connected to this node (also known as degree). We calculated the degrees for each node for the two networks at each sparsity level. Next, at each sparsity level, correlations of node degrees between the coactivation network and the resting-state network were calculated at the sparsity range of 6\u201340%. The correlations reflected the similarity of hub distributions of the two networks. There were only small correlations of degrees between the two networks (see Results below), i.e., a high degree node in the resting-state network was not necessarily a high degree node in the coactivation network. Hence, we subtracted the degrees between the two networks for each node at the sparsity level of 10, 20, and 30%. At each of the three sparsity levels, we sorted the degree differences. The two networks were also randomized using the method mentioned above, and the sorted degree differences were calculated. The randomization was conducted 1000 times, and the distribution of the sorted degree differences was obtained. Then, the original sorted degree differences between the coactivation network and resting-state network was compared with the distribution. Next, at each sparsity level, five nodes that had the largest degree differences and five nodes that had the least degree differences between the coactivation network and the resting-state network were identified. These nodes were rendered on a brain surface model using the BrainNet Viewer ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Coactivation and resting-state networks \n  \nThe pattern of the coactivation and the resting-state correlation matrix were comparable (Figures  ). Because the ROIs were arranged according to their network affiliations as reported by Dosenbach et al. ( ), square like structures along the diagonal were observed in both networks (see supplementary Table   for the network affiliations of the ROIs). In addition, the coactivation strengths and the resting-state correlation strengths among the 9730 (140 \u00d7 139/2) pairs of ROIs showed a strong linear relationship (Figure  ), i.e., if two regions had higher correlation in the resting-state, they also had higher coactivation strength, and vice versa. The Pearson correlation between the coactivation strengths and connectivity strengths was 0.72 (  r   = 0.51). \n  \n Coactivation matrix (A), resting-state correlation matrix (B), and the relationship between coactivation strengths and resting-state correlations (C).   Each dot in the scatter plot represents one pair of ROIs. The red line in panel   (C)   represents the linear fit. \n  \n\n### Small world and modularity \n  \nBoth the coactivation network and the resting-state network revealed smaller global efficiency and larger clustering coefficient compared with the reference random networks, which characterizes the small world network properties (Figure  ). Direct comparison between the coactivation network and the resting-state network revealed greater global efficiency and smaller mean clustering coefficient for the coactivation network compared with the resting-state network at selected sparsity levels (highlighted by shading in Figure  ). Thresholding at a significance level of   p   < 0.001, greater global efficiency for the coactivation network were present at almost all the sparsity levels that were tested between 6 and 40% (except for 23%), while smaller mean clustering coefficient for the coactivation network were only present at the sparsity level between 28 and 40%. \n  \n Global efficiency (A) and mean clustering coefficient (B) for the coactivation, resting-state, and random networks as a function of connectivity sparsity.   The shading areas represent significant differences between the coactivation and resting-state networks at   p   < 0.001 based on 1000 permutations. \n  \nBoth the coactivation network and the resting-state network revealed higher modularity compared with the random networks (Figure  ). The coactivation network generally revealed lower modularity than the resting-state network at sparsity level between 17 and 40% at the significance level of   p   < 0.001. Figures   demonstrated the modular structures of the coactivation network and the resting-state network at sparsity level of 20%. For the resting-state network, four modules were clearly visible with a large number of within module connections and a small number of between modules connections. In contrast, five modules for the coactivation network were difficult to distinguish since there were large numbers of between module connections. \n  \n (A)   Modularity for the coactivation, resting-state, and random networks as a function of connectivity sparsity. The shading areas represent significant differences between the coactivation and resting-state networks at   p   < 0.001 based on 1000 permutations. Panels   (B,C)   demonstrate the modular structures for the coactivation network and the resting-state network at sparsity level 20%. The node colors in panels B and C encode different modules. \n  \n\n### Hub shifts \n  \nAt all sparsity levels between 6 and 40%, the correlations between node degrees of the coactivation network and the resting-state network were small (range from 0.17 to 0.38) (Figure  ). We then plotted the node degrees of the coactivation network against the node degrees of the resting-state network at 10, 20, and 30% sparsity levels (Figures  ). We observed that there were several nodes in the upper right corner or lower right corner of the scatter plots, which indicates that these nodes had higher degrees in one network but not in the other network. \n  \n (A)   Correlations between nodes' degree of the coactivation network and the resting-state network as a function of connectivity sparsity. Panels   (B\u2013D)   show the scatter plots of node degrees between the two networks at sparsity level of 10%   (B)  , 20%   (C)  , and 30%   (D)  , respectively. The lines in the scatter plots represent the linear fit. \n  \nAdditional analysis showed that the distribution of degree differences between the coactivation network and the resting-state network were outside the distribution of sorted degree differences of randomized 1000 permutations (Figures  ), indicating that the degree differences between the two networks are not likely due to random noises. We then subtracted the degrees in the activation network by the degrees in the resting-state network for all 140 nodes at sparsity levels of 10, 20, and 30%, respectively. The top five nodes that had the greatest degree differences between the two networks are illustrated in Figures   and Table  . Across the three sparsity levels, the bilateral thalamus demonstrated higher degrees in the coactivation network compared with the resting-state network. Other regions, including the basal ganglia, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), posterior parietal cortex, medial frontal cortex (mFC), and anterior insula, also showed higher degrees in the coactivation network at various sparsity levels. In contrast, a node in the inferior temporal cortex revealed consistently higher degree in the resting-state network compared with the coactivation network. Other regions, including the precuneus, angular gyrus, inferior parietal sulcus (IPS), temporoparietal junction (TPJ), superior frontal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and inferior cerebellum, also showed higher degrees in the resting-state network at various sparsity levels. The connectivity of the thalamus and the left inferior cortex for the two networks at sparsity level of 20% are illustrated in Figure  . \n  \n Top row, sorted degree differences of 140 ROIs between the coactivation network and the resting-state network at sparsity of 10% (A), 20% (B), and 30%(C), respectively.

Bottom row, five regions that have largest and least degree differences between the coactivation network and the resting-state network at sparsity of 10%   (D)  , 20%   (E)  , and 30%   (F)  , respectively. \n    \n Top five regions that have greater or smaller degree in the coactivation network as compared with in the resting-state network for the sparsity of 10, 20, and 30%, respectively  . \n  \nRegions highlighted in bold represent the regions show consistent differences between the two networks across the three sparsity levels. \n    \n Connectivity of the thalamus (A,B) and left inferior temporal cortex (ITC) (C,D) for the coactivation (A,C) and resting-state correlation (B,D) networks at sparsity of 20%  . \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current study compared the whole brain network configurations between the coactivation network and the resting-state network. We first observed a high correlation between the coactivation strength and the resting-state correlation across all pairs of ROIs. In other words, if a pair of brain regions has greater functional connectivity in the resting-state, they are more likely to have greater coactivation, and vice versa. This is in line with previous findings that the coactivation patterns correspond well with the resting-state connectivity and networks (Toro et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ). However, further analysis revealed substantial differences in network configuration between the two networks. Specifically, the coactivation network revealed higher global efficiency, lower mean clustering coefficient, and lower modularity as compared with the resting-state network. Shifts in hub regions were also observed where the thalamus had greater degrees in the coactivation network than in the resting-state network, and a region in the left inferior temporal cortex had greater degrees in the resting-state network than in the coactivation network. These results were similar when using NKI-dataset (see supplementary materials). \n\nThe brain network exhibits a so-called \u201csmall-world\u201d property (Watts and Strogatz,  ) that the network has greater mean local efficiency but smaller global efficiency than random network. Small world properties have been initially shown in non-human primates (Sporns,  ; Stephan et al.,  ) and later in human brain network using both the resting-state fMRI (Salvador et al.,  ; van den Heuvel et al.,  ) and diffusion weighted imaging (Hagmann et al.,  ; Gong et al.,  ). The current results revealed greater global efficiency and smaller mean local efficiency for the coactivation network as compared with the resting-state network, suggesting that the whole brain is connected more efficiently to support global information flow during task performing. These results are in line with the findings that the brain exhibits higher global efficiency as task difficulty increases (Kitzbichler et al.,  ), and in the awake state compared with the stage 1 sleep (Uehara et al.,  ). \n\nThe current study also revealed smaller modularity in the coactivation network as compared with the resting-state network. These results suggest that the whole brain is less segregated as independent modules when performing tasks as compared with the resting-state. In other words, there are more between module connections and less within module connections when performing tasks, while more within module connections and less between module connections exist in the resting-state. These results are in line with the economy theory of brain network that long range between system connections are more costly, so that dynamic connectivity between brain systems is only present upon task demands (Bullmore and Sporns,  ). Consistent with this notion, brain network modularity reduces when the task demand increases (Kitzbichler et al.,  ), and in awake state than during non-rapid eye movement sleep (Boly et al.,  ). \n\nIn addition to the whole brain network properties, the current study also identified hub regions by calculating degrees (number of connections) for each ROI. In contrast to the high correlation of network strengths between the coactivation network and the resting-state network, the correlations of node degrees between the two networks are small (around 0.3). This suggests a hub shift between task performance and resting-state (Fransson et al.,  ; Achard et al.,  ), which may reflect the adaptive brain reorganization that support the execution of tasks. However, the low correlations of degrees are inconsistent with a previous study showing a high correlation of degrees between a passive fixation condition and a continuous semantic classification task condition (Buckner et al.,  ). The differences may be due to the methodological differences used by Buckner et al. (voxel-wise analysis); the voxel-wise degree distributions are likely to be affected by the underlying brain anatomy, and the high correlation between the two degree maps may partially reflect the anatomical information. In addition, the differences may also be explained by the task adopted by Buckner et al., which is different from the current coactivation approach. Further studies are needed to investigate shifts in hubs elicited by different tasks. \n\nThe thalamus regions showed consistently higher degrees (the number of connections with other regions) in the coactivation network as compared with the resting-state network. The thalamus relays visual and auditory information gathered from the eyes and ears to the cerebral cortex (Hotta and Kameda,  ). Different parts of the thalamus have intensive connections to wide spread cortical regions (Zhang et al.,  ; Eckert et al.,  ). In addition, the thalamus as a relay is important for corticocortical communication, and thus is suggested to be a potential hub for the brain function (Guillery,  ). Previous resting-state fMRI studies occasionally identified the thalamus as a hub region (van den Heuvel et al.,  ), however, most of studies did not support this view (Achard et al.,  ; Buckner et al.,  ; Yan and He,  ; Zuo et al.,  ). This may be because the centrality (as measured by degree or eigenvector centrality) of the thalamus is context specific (Lohmann et al.,  ; Gili et al.,  ). This is in line with the present result, and suggests that the thalamus mediates corticocortical communication during task, but this mediation is weakened in the resting-state. \n\nIn contrast, the left inferior temporal cortex region revealed higher degree in the resting-state network as compared with the coactivation network. This region is part of the DMN (Raichle et al.,  ; Buckner et al.,  ), which is generally deactivated during tasks (Shulman et al.,  ). Regions that are connected with the left inferior temporal cortex mostly constitute the DMN (Figure  ). Consistent with previous studies of brain centrality (Achard et al.,  ; Buckner et al.,  ), the left inferior temporal cortex showed high centrality in resting-state. But, the current analysis also revealed that the degree is significantly less in the coactivation network. This may reflect the less involvement of this region during tasks as compared with the resting-state (Shulman et al.,  ). \n\nBy comparing network configurations of the coactivation network with the resting-state network, the current analysis provides insight on the different brain modes during task and resting-state. The brain during task exhibits greater small-worldness that facilitates global information transmission, and smaller modularity that facilitate information transmission between different systems. These results motivate future studies to investigate brain network configurations in different task conditions. In addition, the current analysis identified the thalamus as a hub region only in the coactivation network but not the resting-state network, suggesting that the role of thalamus in the brain network may be overlooked when studying the resting-state brain network. A difficulty of studying thalamus connectivity is that the thalamus is spatially heterogeneous, so that different substructures connect to different brain regions (Zhang et al.,  ; Eckert et al.,  ). Future studies may need to use fine spatial scales to investigate the thalamus and its effect on network configurations (Wang et al.,  ; Hayasaka and Laurienti,  ). \n\nRecently, several efforts have been made to study brain networks using inter-individual covariance from different imaging modalities, for example brain structures (Mechelli et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ), brain metabolisms (Horwitz et al.,  ; Di et al.,  ), and resting-state brain parameters (Zhang et al.,  ; Taylor et al.,  ). Although these studies provide information on brain integration, the lack of theoretical basis causes difficulty in combining results from different imaging modalities. The current study may provide a theoretical framework to relate the different levels of brain network (e.g., anatomical, metabolic, and hemodynamic) in terms of local/global efficiencies and modular integrations. Future work on systematically comparing different levels of brain network configuration will facilitate in testing theories of brain organization such as the economic theory (Bullmore and Sporns,  ). \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tLabel\tDegree differences Coactivation > correlation\nx\ty\tz\tUnnamed: 3_level_1\tDegree differences Coactivation > correlation\nSPARSITY = 10%\tSPARSITY = 10%\tSPARSITY = 10%\tSPARSITY = 10%\tSPARSITY = 10%\n\u221212\t\u221212\t6\tThalamus\t27\n11\t\u221212\t6\tThalamus\t24\n\u221241\t\u221240\t42\tIPL\t21\n\u221235\t\u221246\t48\tPost-parietal\t18\n0\t15\t45\tmFC\t16\n\u221236\t18\t2\tAnt insula\t16\n\u221216\t29\t54\tSup frontal\t\u221218\n\u221236\t\u221269\t40\tIPS\t\u221218\n23\t33\t47\tSup frontal\t\u221219\n\u221259\t\u221225\t\u221215\tInf temporal\t\u221221\n51\t\u221259\t34\tAngular gyrus\t\u221221\nSPARSITY = 20%\tSPARSITY = 20%\tSPARSITY = 20%\tSPARSITY = 20%\tSPARSITY = 20%\n\u221212\t\u221212\t6\tThalamus\t54\n11\t\u221212\t6\tThalamus\t42\n\u221220\t6\t7\tBasal ganglia\t36\n\u221212\t\u22123\t13\tThalamus\t30\n\u221241\t\u221231\t48\tPost-parietal\t30\n23\t33\t47\tSup frontal\t\u221223\n\u22123\t\u221238\t45\tPrecuneus\t\u221224\n\u221252\t\u221263\t15\tTPJ\t\u221226\n\u221216\t29\t54\tSup frontal\t\u221228\n\u221259\t\u221225\t\u221215\tInf temporal\t\u221237\nSPARSITY = 30%\tSPARSITY = 30%\tSPARSITY = 30%\tSPARSITY = 30%\tSPARSITY = 30%\n\u221212\t\u221212\t6\tThalamus\t61\n11\t\u221212\t6\tThalamus\t52\n\u221212\t\u22123\t13\tThalamus\t37\n\u221241\t\u221240\t42\tIPL\t37\n\u221220\t6\t7\tBasal ganglia\t34\n18\t\u221281\t\u221233\tInf cerebellum\t\u221226\n\u22123\t\u221238\t45\tPrecuneus\t\u221226\n\u221221\t\u221279\t\u221233\tInf cerebellum\t\u221226\n\u221252\t\u221263\t15\tTPJ\t\u221231\n\u221220\t\u221233\t\u22124\tParahippocampal\t\u221231\n\u221259\t\u221225\t\u221215\tInf temporal\t\u221239\n### Caption\nTop five regions that have greater or smaller degree in the coactivation network as compared with in the resting-state network for the sparsity of 10, 20, and 30%, respectively.\n### Footer\nRegions highlighted in bold represent the regions show consistent differences between the two networks across the three sparsity levels.\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 3775427, "text_md5": "95ae6b5cfedca4a31ab424c1f91f5a99", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 62], "journal": [63, 81], "publication_year": [83, 87], "title": [98, 206], "keywords": [220, 317], "abstract": [330, 1743], "body": [1752, 31466], "tables": [31479, 33008]}, "batch": 5, "pmid": 24062654, "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2013.00493", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3775427", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3775427"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3775427\">3775427</a>", "list_title": "PMC3775427  Task vs. rest\u2014different network configurations between the coactivation and the resting-state brain networks"}
{"text": "Chechko, Natalia and Kellermann, Thilo and Zvyagintsev, Michael and Augustin, Marc and Schneider, Frank and Habel, Ute\nPLoS One, 2012\n\n# Title\n\nBrain Circuitries Involved in Semantic Interference by Demands of Emotional and Non-Emotional Distractors\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nPrevious studies have indicated that the processes leading to the resolution of emotional and non-emotional interference conflicts are unrelated, involving separate networks. It is also known that conflict resolution itself suggests a considerable overlap of the networks. Our study is an attempt to examine how these findings may be related. \n\n\n## Methodology/Principal Findings \n  \nWe used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study neural responses of 24 healthy subjects to emotional and non-emotional conflict paradigms involving the presentation of congruent and incongruent word-face pairs based on semantic incompatibility between targets and distractors. In the emotional task, the behavioral interference conflict was greater (compared to the non-emotional task) and was paralleled by involvement of the extrastriate visual and posterodorsal medial frontal cortices. In both tasks, we also observed a common network including the dorsal anterior cingulate, the supplemental motor area, the anterior insula and the inferior prefrontal cortex, indicating that these brain structures are markers of experienced conflict. However, the emotional task involved conflict-triggered networks to a considerably higher degree. \n\n\n## Conclusions/Significance \n  \nOur findings indicate that responses to emotional and non-emotional distractors involve the same systems, which are capable of flexible adjustments based on conflict demands. The function of systems related to conflict resolution is likely to be adjusted on the basis of an evaluation process that primarily involves the extrastriate visual cortex, with target playing a significant role. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nGoal-directed behavior suggests efficient executive processes enabling one to maintain focus on task-relevant information even while this ability is challenged by potent distractors. Emotional distractors have been proved to be particularly effective in capturing our attention and processing resources. Thus, emotionally significant words divert attention from the main task, making one take longer to name ink colors or count the number of words when the words are emotional compared to when they are neutral  \u2013 . This effect is also seen in emotional interference tasks such as emotional counting Stroop  . Comparing the emotional and non-emotional counting Stroop tasks, a functional segregation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in cognitive (dorsal) and emotional (rostral) subdivisions has been suggested  ,  , indicating that the resolution of emotional and non-emotional interference conflicts might entail different processes, involving separate networks. However, the comparison of these two tasks is limited by the fact that the emotional counting Stroop task does not involve true interference effect  . Indeed, in both tasks, the subjects report, through button press, the number of words (1\u20134) that appear on a screen. However, in the emotional counting task, interference trials contain emotional words (e.g., \u201cmurder\u201d written three times), whereas in the non-emotional counting Stroop interference trials contain number words that are incongruent with the correct response (e.g., \u201ctwo\u201d written three times)  ,  . Thus, while emotional counting task primarily measures the ability of emotional words (distractors) to withdraw attention from the main task (counting of words), the non-emotional task measures selective attention and how easily a person can suppress a habitual response, such as reading, in favor of a less familiar task, such as counting. \n\nThe current study was designed primarily to examine how the networks related to emotional interference triggered by semantic incompatibility between emotional target and emotional distractor differ from those involved in non-emotional interference. We took into account the limitations (lack of stable behavioral interference effect) of previous studies applying emotional analogs of interference tasks  \u2013  and suggested emotional and non-emotional interference tasks in which the interference effect was based on semantic incompatibility between target and distractor. In order to make the tasks comparable, we proposed two distractor-specific interference conflicts whereby the emotional task required focusing on emotional features of the face and the non-emotional task on the non-emotional features. Consequently, in both tasks, we used the same emotional faces as targets with two different assignments \u2013 emotional recognition and age judging. In the emotional word-face interference task used in our study, stable behavioral interference effect arises from semantic incompatibility between task-relevant (recognition of emotional face) and task-irrelevant (reading of emotional word) information, and in the non-emotional word-face interference task, the conflict effect ensues from semantic incompatibility between task-relevant (judgment of the person's age) and task-irrelevant information (reading of a word whose meaning does not fit the target's age category). Thus, both tests measure selective attention and how easily a person can suppress a habitual response, such as reading, in favor of a less familiar task, such as recognition of facial expression or age judging. \n\nWe sought to investigate the effect of emotional compared to non-emotional distractors on the processes of interference resolution and expected, based on results from previous studies, emotional distractors to produce increased interference effect. We applied the tasks to test for two possible outcomes pertaining to increased distractibility prompted by emotional words. First, on the basis of evidence suggesting dissociable effect of emotion on brain activity  , whether the emotional distractor would increase activity in brain regions responsible for emotional processing (amygdala, ventrolateral and medial prefrontal cortices, rostral ACC) while simultaneously decreasing activity in the regions responsible for conflict resolution processes (dorsal ACC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Second, if any interference task (whether triggered by an emotional or non-emotional distractor) based on the semantic incompatibility between target and distractor would also involve networks associated with interference resolution in general. We deemed it likely that any interference (whether triggered by an emotional or non-emotional distractor) would also increase demands for executive control to suppress the distracting information. This, in turn, would suggest the involvement of overlapping networks associated with interference, whether triggered by emotional or non-emotional distractors. Like the networks underlying this function in the non-emotional interference Stroop tasks, we expected to see the involvement of the dorsal ACC, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus, the posterior parietal cortex, and the anterior insula  ,  . We also sought to determine if these networks are capable of dynamic adjustments based on the increased demands exerted by emotional distractors. Finally, the goal was to prove whether interference resolution in the emotional task would be facilitated by the target's emotional salience. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nThe participants were students from Aachen University, recruited by means of an advertisement. 24 healthy right-handed participants (12 women and 12 men), all native speakers of German, took part in the study. Participants with neurological, psychiatric or other medical illnesses with impact on brain functioning were excluded. Previous head injuries with loss of consciousness and substance abuse or dependence were the additional exclusion criteria. Demographic variables and other criteria for comparison are summarized in  . All participants were screened by an experienced psychiatrist (NC) from the university hospital Aachen. The screening included a short version of the structured clinical interview for Axis I disorder (SCID-I, German version  ) and an interview during which the participants' medical history was recorded. During the latter, participants with Axis II disorders were identified and excluded. The decision was based on clinical observation, information (obtained during the interview) related to the subjects' life events, typical behavior and relationships, their inner experience and capacity for self-reflection. \n   Demographic and neuropsychological characterizations.      \nA detailed description of the study protocol was provided and all participants gave written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University. All subjects received a standardized instruction regarding the paradigm and a 5-minute training session outside the scanner. The training session included 2.5-minute presentations of the first and the second tasks, whereas the stimuli from both tasks were presented randomly. The aim was to explain the tasks to the participants so that they would know how to respond by pressing buttons. \n\nFunctional imaging was performed on a 3T Trio MR scanner (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) using echo-planar imaging sensitive to BOLD contrast (voxel size: 3.0\u00d73.0\u00d73.0 mm , 64\u00d764 matrix, FoV: 192 mm , 34 slices, gap 0. 75 mm, TR 2 s, TE 28 ms, \u03b1\u200a=\u200a77\u00b0). The scans were acquired in interleaved mode. \n\nBetween two runs, we took a short break in order to introduce the subsequent task once again, thus enabling participants to focus attention on the new requirements. \n\n### Interference tasks \n  \nIn the emotional interference task, combinations of an emotional face in the background (with a sad, or fearful, or happy facial expression) with one of the following words (distractors) \u2018TRAUER\u2019, \u2018ANGST\u2019, and \u2018GL\u00dcCK\u2019 (German for \u201csadness\u201d, \u201cfear\u201d and \u201chappiness\u201d) printed across the face in bold red letters represented emotionally congruent or incongruent stimuli. The participants were asked to judge the emotion of the faces while trying to ignore the words. In the non-emotional interference task, the same emotional faces were presented in the same order with the words \u201cJ\u00dcNGER\u201d, \u201cMITTEL\u201d or \u201c\u00c4LTER\u201d (German for \u201cyounger\u201d, \u201cmiddle-aged\u201d or \u201colder\u201d) superimposed in red letters, producing age-congruent and -incongruent stimuli. Subjects were required to classify the faces as being young (20 years or younger), middle-aged (middle 30 s to middle 40 s) or older (older than 60 years of age), while trying to ignore the task-irrelevant distractor. Except for the distractors, the paradigm remained constant (see  ). \n   Non-emotional and emotional conflict paradigms.  \n(A) Basic stimulus material consisting of congruent and incongruent face expression/word pairs from the FEBA faces collection for emotional paradigm. (B) Analogous to non-emotional conflict task, basic stimulus material for non-emotional paradigm. \n  \n120 trials were presented in one run. The trials were classified as congruent (C) or incongruent (I). The number of congruent and incongruent trials, the number of faces belonging to each emotional or age category, and the number of face-word combinations were counterbalanced for both tasks. Participants were instructed to identify the facial expression and answer as quickly and precisely as possible by pressing one of the three answer buttons with the right index, middle or ring finger for sad, fearful or happy faces, or for younger, middle-aged or older age categories respectively. \n\nImages of the faces were taken from the set used in Facial Emotions for Brain Activation (FEBA) test   and put in standardized positions of the eyes and the mouth and normalized brightness. Faces were displayed for 1000 ms with randomized interstimulus interval (4.00\u00b10.38 s (mean\u00b1SD), range 3\u20135 s) using Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, San Francisco, USA). Between face presentations, a fixation cross was shown. Participants watched the pictures via video goggles (VisuaStim XGA, Resonance Technology Inc., Los Angeles, USA) and gave responses via LUMItouch response system ( ). \n\nReaction times (RT) were collected during the fMRI experiment. Error trials (wrong answers and omissions) were excluded from the analysis. For accuracy calculations, all types of errors were considered. \n\n\n### Image preprocessing \n  \nImages were processed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software (version SPM5,  ) on a Linux workstation. The first five images of each time series were excluded due to T1 stabilization effects. All remaining images were slice-time corrected and realigned to the first image. Images were normalized to a standard EPI template (interpolation to 2\u00d72\u00d72 mm  resolution) and smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel (8 mm full width at half maximum). \n\nFor each subject, two different first-level models for fMRI data were estimated in order to perform two analyses on the second level with different emphases. The first model sought to identify brain regions that are sensitive to the congruency effect of the presented face and the superimposed word, while, concurrently, modeling the three different emotions of the faces. These effects were estimated for each task (emotional and non-emotional) separately. Thus, the two sessions were modeled with 12 regressors of interest: 2 task (emotional vs. non-emotional) by 2 conflict (congruent vs. incongruent) by 3 facial expression (sad, fear, happy). Delta-functions with the time-points of presentation of the trials of each type were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) to build regressors for the model of the time-series. The first-level model also included an additional (HRF-convolved) regressor of no interest for error trials (wrong answers and omissions) and an intercept for the mean across each session. A high-pass filter with a cut-off period of 128 s was applied and serial auto-correlations were accounted for by including a first-order auto-regressive covariance structure (AR(1)). \n\nContrast estimates of the 12 regressors of interest from each subject were entered in a three-way ANOVA with dependent observations (task (2 levels) by congruency (2 levels) by facial expression (3 levels)). The main goal of the current study was to show differences and commonalities between brain regions related to resolving conflict during two different tasks. To this end, we first calculated contrasts for the task by conflict interaction in order to stress the differences. Second, we present the conflict contrasts for each single task independently, for illustrative purposes. Finally, in order to assess the commonalities, we also present conjunctions of conflict contrasts which are described in greater detail below. \n\nUnless otherwise stated, the significance level for all main effects of the imaging data was set to p<0.05 corrected at the cluster-level using a cluster-defining threshold of p<0.0001 at the voxel-level. This is also true for the correlational analyses, which were performed in order to reveal brain regions associated with reaction times. The contrast for the task by conflict interaction was likewise thresholded at p<0.05 corrected at the cluster-level. Due to the reduced sensitivity of interaction as opposed to the main effects, however, we decided to perform the correction of the task by conflict interaction on clusters formed at p<0.001 uncorrected. \n\nApart from showing differences between the conflict contrasts we also stress the commonalities of different (independent) contrasts of incongruent vs. congruent items. For this purpose we calculated the conflict contrasts for each level of the different faces and the two tasks, i.e. six of these conflict contrasts were created. In order to assess what all of these contrasts had in common, we put these six contrasts in conjunction thresholded at p<0.05 uncorrected  . This liberal threshold accounts for the fact that a voxel to be declared significant had to pass six simultaneous tests at this threshold, with the probability of six independent events occurring simultaneously when the probability of each single event is 0.05 equals 0.05  or 1.5625e-8. In addition, we show the three conflict contrasts from the emotional task in conjunction at the threshold of p<0.05 uncorrected. Again, the probability of three independent events occurring simultaneously when the probability of each single event is 0.05 equals 0.05  or 0.000125. It is stressed that the nominal significance level is p<0.05 uncorrected for each of the conjunctions and that the calculation of the joint probabilities is just for illustrative purposes. By showing these conjunctions, we aimed at identifying regions that are involved in each single conflict contrast simultaneously. \n\nCorrelation analyses determined the relationship between activation strength in response to incongruent (as compared to congruent) trials in single-subject contrasts on one hand and individual conflict-related reaction time slowing (difference in reaction time in response to incongruent as compared to congruent trials) on the other. This analysis was done separately for emotional and non-emotional tasks. \n\nThe resulting SPM(T) and correlation maps were anatomically localized using version 1.5 of the SPM Anatomy toolbox ( ,  ,  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nFor a three-way   task   \u00d7   congruency   \u00d7   face   RTs analysis of variance (ANOVA), items were assigned to each level of the factors   task   (two levels) \u00d7   congruency   (two levels) and   face   (three levels) The analysis revealed the   task   \u00d7   congruency   interaction (  F  \u200a=\u200a20.0, p<0.001) since the interference effect was stronger in the task based on word-emotion than in the one based on word-age interference (164 ms vs. 82 ms). There was also significant   task   \u00d7   face   interaction (  F  \u200a=\u200a16.5, p\u200a=\u200a0.001). \n\nIn order to assess the putative effects of emotion or age categories on RTs, we also performed two-way ANOVA separately for each of the two tasks, first with the factors   emotion   (three levels: sadness, fear, happiness) and   congruency   (two levels) and then with the factors   age   (three levels: younger, middle-aged, older) and   congruency  . In the emotional task, an   emotion   \u00d7   congruency   analysis of variance on RT data revealed a significant effect of the factor   congruency   (  F  \u200a=\u200a58.4, p<0.001), as incongruent stimuli were processed more slowly (for descriptive statistics see  ). The same analysis also revealed a significant effect of the factor   emotion (F  \u200a=\u200a22.2, p<0.001). As post hoc analysis revealed, incongruent stimuli with happy facial expressions were associated with faster RTs as compared to the incongruent stimuli with sad (or fearful expressions (t \u200a=\u200a\u22128.5, p<0.001 and t \u200a=\u200a\u22126,1, p<0.001 respectively). The same applied to the congruent stimuli (t \u200a=\u200a\u22125.5, p<0.001 and t \u200a=\u200a\u22124,0, p\u200a=\u200a0.001 respectively) ( ). In the non-emotional interference task, only a significant main effect of congruency was detected (  F  \u200a=\u200a20.7, p<0.001: 967 ms\u00b1165 ms vs. 886 ms\u00b1163 ms (mean\u00b1SD) for incongruent and congruent stimuli respectively). \n   Descriptive statistics of behavioral data in emotional task.      \nA three-  way task   \u00d7   congruency   \u00d7 face accuracy analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant main effect of task (  F  \u200a=\u200a114,5, p<0.001) as the emotional task was associated with a higher level of correct responses (93% vs. 78%). In order to assess the putative effects of emotion or age categories on accuracy, we also performed two-way ANOVA separately for each of the two tasks, first with the factors   emotion   (three levels: sadness, fear, happiness) and   congruency   (two levels) and then with the factors   age   (three levels: younger, middle-aged, older) and   congruency  . In the emotional task, an   emotion   \u00d7   congruency   accuracy analysis of variance on RT data revealed a significant effect of the factors   congruency (F  \u200a=\u200a11.3, p\u200a=\u200a0.004; 95% vs. 91% for congruent and incongruent stimuli respectively) and   emotion (F  \u200a=\u200a3.9, p\u200a=\u200a0.040) as targets with happy expressions were associated with a higher level of accuracy (96% of all happy faces, 91% of all sad faces and 92% of all fearful faces were correctly recognized). In the non-emotional task, there was significant effect only of the factor   congruency (F  \u200a=\u200a15.0, p\u200a=\u200a0.001; 80% vs.75% for congruent and incongruent stimuli respectively. \n\n\n### FMRI results \n  \n#### Differences in response to conflict between tasks \n  \nThe emotional compared with the non-emotional interference task led to a stronger recruitment of the posterodorsal medial frontal cortex (pMFC) in the region where Brodmann areas 8, 6, 32 and 24 border one another. Another cluster of significant activation included the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC) with the adjunct left anterior insula. The bilateral occipitotemporal visual cortex, including the bilateral fusiform gyri, the bilateral inferior and middle temporal gyri, and the bilateral inferior and middle occipital gyri, was also recruited more strongly. The same applied to the left superior (SPL) and the left inferior parietal lobules (IPL), and the bilateral cerebellum (  and  ). \n   Areas recruited more strongly in response to emotional as compared to non-emotional conflict.  \n(A) The emotional interference task, as compared to the non-emotional task, led to a stronger recruitment of the posterodorsal medial frontal cortex encompassing Brodman areas 8, 6, 32 and 24. The intersection is in left SMA (MNI coordinates: x\u200a=\u200a\u22128, y\u200a=\u200a12, z\u200a=\u200a54). (B) Stronger recruitment of left IFC/anterior insula region (MNI coordinates: x\u200a=\u200a\u221248, y\u200a=\u200a8, z\u200a=\u200a0) and the left occipitotemporal visual cortex. (C) Recruitment of the right fusiform face area (MNI coordinates: x\u200a=\u200a36, y\u200a=\u200a\u221244, z\u200a=\u200a\u221222). (D) Bilateral recruitment of the bilateral occipitotemporal visual cortex. Intersection is in the right inferior temporal gyrus (MNI coordinates: x\u200a=\u200a44, y\u200a=\u200a\u221268, z\u200a=\u200a\u221210). Activity is shown at P<0.05 (cluster-level family-wise error-corrected; cluster-forming threshold at voxel-level P<0.001). \n     Brain regions that are more strongly involved in response to conflict (I>C) in emotional compared to non-emotional task at P<0.05 cluster-level family-wise error-corrected; cluster-forming threshold at voxel-level P<0.001.      \nThe opposite contrast showed differences between the tasks in the right superior and middle frontal gyri ( ). This effect was seen at whole brain P<0.001 uncorrected. \n\n\n#### Effect of both types of conflict on BOLD response \n  \nAs the conjunction analysis reveals, the anterior dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC), the bilateral anterior insula with the adjacent inferior frontal cortex (IFC), the bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMA) and the left thalamus were recruited more strongly in response to incongruent compared to congruent trials in both tasks. Results are presented in  . \n   Brain regions involved in each single conflict contrast (I>C), independent of the task and the facial expression.        \n\n#### Effect of emotional conflict on BOLD response \n  \nAt a whole-brain FWE correction of P<0.05 with a cluster extent of 20 voxels, in response to incongruent compared to congruent trials, significant BOLD signal increased in the dACC, the bilateral SMA and the left precentral gyrus. Within the bilateral occipitotemporal visual cortex, activation was seen in the bilateral fusiform gyrus, the bilateral inferior temporal and the bilateral inferior occipital gyri. The bilateral anterior insula/bilateral IFC region was also more strongly recruited. The same applied to the left pallidum and the bilateral cerebellum. Results are presented in   and  . As the conjunction analysis demonstrated, those regions responded to emotional conflict independent of the type of emotional target ( ). In addition, the conjunction analysis revealed involvement of the right middle temporal and bilateral middle occipital gyri, the bilateral thalamus and the right caudate nucleus in response to emotional conflict. \n   Effect of emotional conflict.  \n(A) Involvement of left SMA and the left dACC. The intersection is in the left dACC (MNI coordinates: x\u200a=\u200a\u22124, y\u200a=\u200a20, z\u200a=\u200a38). (B) Response of the bilateral anterior insula/IFC region. The intersection is in the left anterior insula (MNI coordinates: x\u200a=\u200a\u221246, y\u200a=\u200a8, z\u200a=\u200a2). (C) Recruitment of the right fusiform face area (MNI coordinates: x\u200a=\u200a36, y\u200a=\u200a\u221252, z\u200a=\u200a\u221222) and the left inferior parietal lobule. (D) Bilateral recruitment of the bilateral occipitotemporal visual cortex. Intersection is in the right temporal gyrus (MNI coordinates: x\u200a=\u200a46, y\u200a=\u200a\u221268, z\u200a=\u200a\u221210). Activity is shown at p<0.05 FWE corrected with a cluster size >20 voxels. \n     Brain regions involved during emotional task in response to interference conflict at P<0.05 voxel-level family-wise error-corrected.      \nIn response to congruent as compared to incongruent trials, there was stronger involvement of the right angular and right superior frontal gyri ( ). This effect was seen at whole brain FWE correction of P<0.05 with a cluster extent of 20 voxels. \n\n\n#### Effect of non-emotional conflict on BOLD response \n  \nAt a whole-brain FWE correction of P<0.05 without a cluster extent, in response to incongruent compared to congruent trials, significant BOLD signal increased in the right inferior frontal gyrus (MNI x\u200a=\u200a46 y\u200a=\u200a20 z\u200a=\u200a16; 57 voxels) and the right middle frontal gyrus (MNI x\u200a=\u200a38 y\u200a=\u200a30 z\u200a=\u200a30; 56 voxels). For exploratory analysis, we also performed analysis at P<0.05 corrected at cluster level, voxel-wise inclusion threshold at p<0.0001, which revealed responses to non-emotional conflict in the right putamen, the right pallidum and the right anterior insula. Further BOLD signal was observed in the right dACC (BA 32). Results are presented in   and  . \n   Effect of non-emotional conflict.  \n(A) Recruitment of the right middle frontal gyrus (MNI coordinates x\u200a=\u200a38, y\u200a=\u200a30, z\u200a=\u200a30). (B) Recruitment of the right inferior frontal gyrus (MNI coordinates x\u200a=\u200a46, y\u200a=\u200a20, z\u200a=\u200a16). (C) Recruitment of the right anterior insula (MNI coordinates x\u200a=\u200a42, y\u200a=\u200a22, z\u200a=\u200a\u22122). D) Recruitment of dACC (MNI coordinates x\u200a=\u200a\u22122, y\u200a=\u200a28, z\u200a=\u200a32). Activity is shown at P<0.05 (cluster-level family-wise error-corrected; cluster-forming threshold at voxel-level P<0.0001). \n     Activated brain regions during non-emotional task in response to interference conflict at P<0.05 cluster-level family-wise error-corrected; cluster-forming threshold at voxel-level P<0.0001.      \nThe opposite contrast (congruent trials > incongruent trials) did not reveal any significant differences. \n\n\n#### Correlation between behavioral interference and neuroimaging data \n  \nIn the emotional task, the stronger interference effect was associated with a network that included the left amygdala, the right thalamus, the right insula, the bilateral lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), the bilateral SMA, the right anterior temporal cortex, the bilateral posterior temporal-occipital cortex, and the bilateral supramarginal gyrus ( ). In the non-emotional task, the stronger the behavioral interference effect, the more vigorous was the recruitment of the bilateral IFC and the left IPL ( ). \n\nNo negative correlations were detected in either task. \n\nFinally, we tested if there were differences in response to conflict between the genders (a congruency-by-gender interaction) for each of the tasks separately. Comparing, first, the emotional and, then, the non-emotional columns of the design between the two groups (i.e. two directional t-contrasts incongruent vs. congruent during emotional task in the female group larger than incongruent vs. congruent during emotional task in the male one, and vice versa) we did not find any differences between the genders at p<0.001 uncorrected. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe applied emotional and non-emotional variations of the Stroop task using face stimuli as targets and word stimuli as distractors. In both versions of the task, emotional and non-emotional distractors generated significant interference conflicts. In the emotional task, the interference effect was greater than in the non-emotional one, owing to high levels of distraction caused by emotional words. There were, however, fewer errors overall in the emotional compared to the non-emotional task, suggesting that when it came to targets, attention was likely facilitated by the emotional features of the faces based on which participants were required to make their judgment. Thus, cognitive functions were influenced by the emotional significance of stimuli, causing increased accuracy as a benefit and increased distractibility as a detrimental effect on the ongoing behavior. A parallel increase of conflict-related activity was seen in the functional systems associated with conflict monitoring and attention. While both tasks engaged the primary visual cortex, it was conflict in the emotional task (entailing focus on emotions) that led to the involvement of the ventral cortical region including the bilateral fusiform gyri (with the fusiform face area) and the bilateral inferior and middle occipital gyri. Thus, interference conflict engaged areas associated with visual attention and high-level visual processing in order to augment the evaluation of emotion-laden information. Task-sensitive activity in the occipitotemporal visual cortex in response to emotional conflict is in line with the notion that attention is guided by an object's affective significance  ,  . The involvement of the fusiform face area suggests that the resolution of conflict was likely facilitated by an enhanced processing of emotionally laden information causing more pronounced emphasis on target. Thus, despite increased distractibility caused by emotional words, goal-specific emotionally salient information helped maintain focus on target. As a consequence, accuracy in the emotional task was higher than in the non-emotional task. These findings also corroborate the idea that the affective processing of a stimulus is linked to cognitive factors such as attention and does not occur automatically  . Thus, despite using the same emotional faces, only the task-relevant attended emotional stimuli led to the involvement of the ventral extrastriate cortex. On the other hand, an elevated need for adjustment in cognitive control to overcome the conflict triggered by emotional words was seen in a stronger involvement of the functionally integrated unit associated with the monitoring-performance mechanism and detection of response conflict (cingulate and paracingulate, association and premotor cortices)  . Further areas of significantly stronger activation were identified in the left inferior frontal gyrus abutting the anterior insula (emotional processing  ,  , implementation of inhibitory processes   and in the temporoparietal junction (target detection  ). We also observed robust involvement of the cerebellum, a region typically thought of as a motor center. Similarly, previous research has suggested the involvement of the cerebellum in mediating conflict resolution processes with participants showing impaired capacity for conflict resolution following cerebellar lesions (despite an intact prefrontal cortex)  . Thus, successful resolution of emotional conflict demonstrates both acceleration and dynamic adjustments of systems in response to elevated conflict-associated demands. It can therefore be suggested that in spite of higher levels of distraction produced by emotional words, the networks involved in conflict resolution succeeded in effective allocation of attentional and control resources to achieve efficient goal-directed behavior. \n\nThe adjustment of conflict resolution processes was also seen on the individual level. Thus, in the emotional task, individual conflict-related reaction time slowing correlated positively with a complex network including the left amygdala, the right thalamus, the bilateral insula/LPFC region, the right anterior temporal cortex, the bilateral posterior temporal-occipital cortex, and the bilateral supramarginal gyri. This network indicates a relationship of higher recruitment of attentional, inhibitory and conflict processing recourses as a response to higher levels of distractibility triggered by emotional words. The link between the difficulty to ignore an emotional distractor and amygdala activity might also endorse the view that the amygdala allocates attentional resources to stimuli required for prioritizing particular features of information processing  . \n\nContrary to findings suggesting specific involvement of the IFC in the inhibition of distracting emotions  , in both tasks participants with stronger interference effects also revealed stronger activation in the IFC. These results are in line with studies that suggest that the IFC's primary role is to select among multiple representations the best to serve the task at hand   and further support the notion of the region's general involvement in the inhibitory function. \n\nIn both tasks, the interference conflict initiated strongly overlapping networks including the regions involved in non-emotional interference  ,  . Thus, we saw conjoint recruitment of processing modules including sensory turning, selective attention during response selection, inhibition (bilateral IFC and insula), premotor planning (bilateral SMA), vigilance, error response monitoring and resolution of response conflict (dACC), and, finally, a motor output (thalamus, motor portion of cingulate cortex) in response to interference conflict in both tasks. Based on this observation, the presence of a general conflict network irrespective of the character of stimulus or distractor can be suggested. For emotional and non-emotional monitored events, the most pronounced cluster of activations is in Brodmann Area 32, which further underscores the role of this area in the unified performance monitoring function  ,  ,  ,  . \n\nTaken together, our results suggest that the resolution of interference triggered by emotional and non-emotional distractors involves the same systems, which are capable of flexible adjustments based on conflict demands. Contrary to the notion that increased interference prompted by emotional words results in diminished cognitive control, our findings indicate dynamic adjustments of the control processes in response to increased distractibility. The evaluation of a task-relevant object's significance in the occipitotemporal cortex appears to play a pivotal role in signaling the necessity for such adjustments of executive functions. Thus, the attentional system being capable of evaluating a target's significance, it helps maintain focus, despite increased distraction, when the target is deemed to be of particular relevance. Moreover, the involvement of the extrastriate cortex in response to emotional conflict suggests that it is not only inhibition of the distractor but also target amplification that is a facilitative mechanism of conflict resolution. Also, target amplification seems to take place when the target (f.e. emotional content) is of particular significance. This issue, however, was beyond the scope of the present study, which was focused on interference conflict, and ought to be explored in future research. Finally, contrary to the notion of a functional segregation of brain areas into ventral (emotional) and dorsal (cognitive) systems, our findings tend to endorse the view of a cognitive-emotional integration   in the executive control functions. As both tasks involved a broad network of frontal and prefrontal regions in response to conflict, the tasks can be applied to study the adjustment capabilities of those systems stressed by different conflict demands. These observations are likely to be of great interest in the context of psychiatric disorders. \n\nAs a limitation of the study, however, we must cite the relatively low number of trials per condition (congruent or incongruent face-word combinations) used in the study \u221220 trials, as opposed to the previously recommended 25, although this critically depends on the expected effect size and therefore also on task and brain region  . However, as we did not detect any significant effect of the target type (e.g. emotional face or age category) on the interference effect, we compared congruent and incongruent trials independently of their emotional (sad, fearful or happy) or non-emotional (young, middle-aged or old) category, putting the trials in simply \u201cemotional\u201d or \u201cnon-emotional\u201d category. It means that in each task the number of trials per condition (congruent vs. incongruent) was 60. In any case, given that even false responses can affect the number of trials, it should be noted that statistical power might have been compromised in the present study. Enhanced power and thus avoidance of false negative results can be expected in future replication studies if more trials per condition are added. \n\nA further limitation of the study is the lack of a structural (T1) scan. It should be noted, therefore, that the absence of anatomical coregistration is likely to have a bearing on the information vis-\u00e0-vis the localization of specific brain structures. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone-0038155-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nGroup characteristics and demographic data\tMean values and standard deviations\nSubject numberGender\t2412 female, 12 male\nAge (years)\t27.6\u00b14.1\nMean education (years)\t17.0\u00b11.4\nProcessing speed (TMT-A, s)\t19.7\u00b14.1\nCognitive flexibility (TMT-B, s)\t36.5\u00b18.0\nVerbal intelligence (WST, IQ)\t104.6\u00b110.6\nFacial recognition (BFRT \u2013 hits, %)\t46.2\u00b14.2\nEmotion discrimination (PERT \u2013 hits, %)\t30.5\u00b15.08\n### Caption\nDemographic and neuropsychological characterizations.\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: pone-0038155-t002\n### Label: Table 2\nCongruency\tEmotion\tRT (ms)\tSD\nCONGRUENT TRIAL\tFEARFUL\t989\t211\n\tHAPPY\t791\t160\n\tSAD\t963\t145\nINCONGRUENT TRIAL\tFEARFUL\t1123\t294\n\tHAPPY\t959\t213\n\tSAD\t1152\t242\n### Caption\nDescriptive statistics of behavioral data in emotional task.\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: pone-0038155-t003\n### Label: Table 3\nAnatomical region\tSide\tk\tFWE-corrected Pcluster\tPeak voxel\tPeak voxel\tPeak voxel\tPeak voxel\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tUnnamed: 1_level_1\tUnnamed: 2_level_1\tUnnamed: 3_level_1\tT\tx\ty\tz\nSMA (BA 6)\tL\t1946.0\tP<0.001\t5.54\t\u22128\t12\t54\nSMA (BA 6)\tR\t\t\t4.56\t4\t14\t50\n(cluster extends to bilateral Anterior Cingulate and bilateral BA 8)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nInferior Occipital Gyrus (BA 19)\tL\t1289.0\tP<0.001\t5.32\t\u221244\t\u221272\t\u221210\nCerebellum (VI)\tL\t\t\t5.26\t\u221232\t\u221256\t\u221228\nFusiform Gyrus (BA 37)\tL\t\t\t4.3\t\u221242\t52\t\u221218\n(cluster extends to Inferior Temporal Gyrus and Middle Occipital Gyrus)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCerebellum (VIII)\tR\t565.0\tP<0.001\t5.51\t8\t\u221270\t\u221240\nCerebellum (VI)\tR\t455.0\tP<0.001\t5.91\t34\t\u221248\t26\nFusiform Gyrus (BA 37)\tR\t\t\t4.92\t36\t\u221244\t\u221222\nInsula (BA 13)\tL\t412.0\tP<0.001\t4.4\t\u221238\t4\t\u22122\nInferior Frontal Gyrus (BA 44)\t\t\t\t4.27\t\u221248\t8\t0\nInferior Temporal Gyrus (BA 20)\tR\t376.0\tP<0.001\t6.14\t44\t\u221268\t\u221210\nInferior Occipital Gyrus (BA 19)\tR\t\t\t5.04\t44\t\u221272\t\u221210\n(cluster extends to right Middle Occipital Gyrus)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSuperior Parietal Lobule (BA 7)\tL\t258.0\tP<0.001\t5.13\t\u221222\t\u221272\t60\nPrecentral Gyrus (BA 6)\tL\t211.0\tP<0.001\t4.29\t\u221242\t\u22126\t62\nInferior Frontal Gyrus (BA 45)\tL\t190.0\tP\u200a=\u200a0.001\t4.52\t\u221248\t30\t16\nInferior Parietal Lobule (BA 40)\tL\t160.0\tP\u200a=\u200a0.002\t4.1\t\u221232\t\u221250\t46\n### Caption\nBrain regions that are more strongly involved in response to conflict (I>C) in emotional compared to non-emotional task at P<0.05 cluster-level family-wise error-corrected;

We exposed participants to their self-identified ideal and ought goals, yoked-control words and non-words. We also examined correlations between goal-related activation and measures of regulatory focus, behavioral activation/inhibition, and negative affect. Ideal priming led to activation in frontal and occipital regions as well as caudate and thalamus, whereas prevention goal priming was associated with activation in precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex. Individual differences in dysphoric/anxious affect and regulatory focus, but not differences in BAS/BIS strength, were predictive of differential activation in response to goal priming. The regions activated in response to ideal and ought goal priming broadly map onto the cortical midline network that has been shown to index processing of self-referential stimuli. Individual differences in regulatory focus and negative affect impact this network and appeared to influence the strength and accessibility of the promotion and prevention systems. The results support a fundamental distinction between promotion and prevention and extend our understanding of how personal goals influence behavior. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nA person's hopes, dreams, and wishes, whether attained or unattained, have always been seen as central to an individual's identity\u2014as the essence of who a person is because they represent that which a person strives to be (James,  ). The kind of individual we wish to be, and the kind of person we believe we must be, are powerful influences on behavior and affect whether we see ourselves as succeeding or failing to attain those wishes and obligations (Kelly,  ). Classic (Allport,  ) as well as contemporary (Morf and Mischel,  ) personality theorists, for example, have used the concept of   becoming   as a rubric for understanding individual differences in motivational orientation along with the affective consequences of failing to be that which we want to be or must be. Personal goals are real in a profoundly psychological sense\u2014dreams and obligations are \u201ctruth\u201d for individuals whether or not they \u201ccome true.\u201d \n\nThe   goal   construct in psychology captures much of how hopes, dreams, and wishes guide behavior and experience. Behavioral scientists have conceptualized personality as reflecting differences among people in terms of the higher-order goals they pursue and their characteristic ways of pursuing them (Cantor and Zirkel,  ). Indeed, goals are a central construct in theories of behavior because they provide a unified conceptual framework linking internal states (needs, motives, beliefs) and the social world. When people believe they have attained an important goal, they may feel joyful, satisfied, fulfilled, or worthy; when people believe they have failed to attain a goal, they may feel inadequate, hopeless, worthless, guilty, or ashamed (Sullivan,  ; Rogers,  ). Yet, to date there has been little research examining how neural systems are engaged when people think about their personal goals, both when the goals are attained as well as when they are not. \n\nIn an influential review, Austin and Vancouver ( ) defined goals as   internal representations of desired states   and identified approach and avoidance goals as among the most important classes of goals. The vast behavioral science and neuroscience literatures on approach and avoidance attest to the centrality of these dimensions for understanding goal-directed behavior. Those literatures are dominated by the behavioral activation and inhibition systems model, postulating brain/behavior systems that underlie temperament-based approach and avoidance as well as dispositional positive and negative affectivity (Watson et al.,  ). Both the behavioral activation system (BAS) and behavioral inhibition system (BIS) are hypothesized to regulate proximal goal-directed behaviors in response to cues for reward, in the case of BAS, or threat, in the case of BIS (Carver and Scheier,  ). The two systems each represent a locus for the interaction of cognitive and affective processes, and each is associated with neural circuitry identified originally on the basis of animal research and shown to have analogs in the human brain (Gray,  ,  ). \n\nMany personality and social theorists take a complementary perspective on the regulation of approach and avoidance, emphasizing abstract, higher-order goals that are cross-situational and integrated within the individual's sense of self. Higgins ( ) proposed a theory of   regulatory focus   that postulated two motivational systems for attainment of desired outcomes. Each is activated by contextual cues but also manifests trait-like properties across situations. Individual differences in regulatory focus are stable over time and predict which goals will be more likely to be used to guide behavior, as well as the strategies and means for pursuing them (Strauman,  ). The behavioral and affective consequences of individual differences in regulatory focus are well-established (Higgins,  ). \n\nRFT draws on prior studies of self-evaluation and discrepancy monitoring and describes two regulatory systems that serve critical but distinct survival needs. The   promotion system  , which develops in response to children's need for nurturance (Bowlby,  ), supports the attainment of positive outcomes by strategic approach, i.e., by \u201cmaking good things happen.\u201d The promotion system is particularly active in the pursuit of ideals (aspirations, advancement, and accomplishment)\u2014that is, the kind of person an individual can be or might be. The   prevention system  , which develops in response to children's need for security (Bowlby,  ), also supports the attainment of positive outcomes, but instead by strategic avoidance, i.e., by \u201ckeeping bad things from happening.\u201d The prevention system is particularly active in pursuit of oughts (fulfillment of responsibilities, duties, and obligations)\u2014that is, the kind of person an individual believes she/he must be or is supposed to be. \n\nIndividuals vary both in the characteristic ways they construe their goals and their chosen strategies to pursue them. As a consequence of variation in life experiences, a person might acquire increased value or personal relevance for one type of goal. For example, a strong value placed on prevention goals will result in goal pursuit strategies that involve keeping bad things from happening\u2014for example, by avoiding pitfalls and negative outcomes in the service of ultimate goal attainment. In addition, the same desired end-state can be represented in different ways by prevention-oriented vs. promotion-oriented individuals. The same goal\u2014such as being honest\u2014could be represented as an ideal or aspiration (a promotion goal) or as an obligation or responsibility (a prevention goal). \n\nIn this article, we examine the neural correlates of priming personal goals using ideals and oughts as exemplars of the two types of goal representations postulated within RFT. We consider three largely unexplored questions about how the brain is engaged in pursuit of ideals and oughts. First, does priming of an individual's ideal vs. ought goals, already shown to result in distinct cognitive, motivational, and affective responses, also lead to discriminable patterns of neural activation? Second, do activation patterns associated with ideal vs. ought goals vary as a function of individual differences relevant to self-regulation? And third, since self-regulatory cognition is inherently connected with affect and with vulnerability to disorders such as depression and anxiety, do activation patterns observed following ideal and/or ought goal priming vary depending on an individual's current level of negative affect? \n\nBased on existing findings in social cognitive neuroscience, there are several different patterns of neural activation that might characterize responses to priming of promotion and prevention goals (and, in turn, contribute to the construct validity of regulatory focus). One set of regions are those structures known to be activated by reward or threat cues, consistent with the role of BAS and BIS as mechanisms for individual differences in sensitivity to such cues (Amodio et al.,  ). There are conceptual links between the BAS system and the promotion system, since promotion goal pursuit requires responsiveness to opportunities for rewards in the environment and the use of strategic approach behaviors to achieve desired ends. There are similar links between the BIS system and the prevention system, because of the relevance of the strategic avoidance of negative outcomes in prevention goal pursuit. BAS-related regions implicated in response to incentives include the ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, with the former a locus for the coding of predictions regarding positive outcomes and the latter important for the processing of the hedonic significance of stimuli (Bjork et al.,  ; McClure et al.,  ; Kringelbach,  ; Clithero et al.,  ). Individual differences in BIS strength have been associated with circuits linking the hippocampus, subiculum, and related structures (sometimes also including the basolateral and centromedial nuclei of the amygdala) (e.g., Reuter et al.,  ). Thus, the neural correlates of promotion vs. prevention could reflect the neuroanatomical distinctions between the substrates of BAS and BIS. \n\nAnother potential set of neural correlates of promotion/prevention goal activation is the group of regions referred to collectively as cortical midline structures (Northoff and Bermpohl,  ; Lou et al.,  ; Qin and Northoff,  ). These structures, which typically include the orbital and adjacent medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and the posterior cingulate cortex, are regarded as an anatomical unit because of strong reciprocal projections among the individual structures and similar patterns of connectivity with other brain regions. They also are characterized as a network that subserves the representation and processing of self-referential stimuli (Beer and Ochsner,  ). This set of regions may underlie the activation of promotion and prevention goals that are functionally linked to aspects of one's identity, including higher-order goals representing one's ideal self or ought self. \n\nA third possibility is that the promotion and prevention goal representations overlap with the Self-Memory System postulated by Conway (SMS; Conway and Pleydell-Pierce,  ). The SMS is a conceptual framework linking self and memory that consists of two main components: the working self and the autobiographical memory knowledge base. Drawing in part on studies of self-discrepancy and autobiographical memory (e.g., Strauman,  ), Conway ( ) proposed that frontotemporal networks mediate the connection between anterior regions associated with the working self (e.g., one's currently active goals and beliefs) and the autobiographical knowledge base, accessed through temporal lobe regions, needed to effectively pursue such goals within a dynamic interpersonal context. \n\nSeveral studies have examined associations between regulatory focus and brain activity, with the evidence to date suggesting a link between promotion/prevention and midline cortical structures as well as a pattern of prefrontal cortex asymmetry akin to that observed in the BAS/BIS literature (Davidson and Irwin,  ). Amodio et al. ( ) examined the associations between an implicit assessment of individual differences in regulatory focus and an EEG index of resting frontal cortical asymmetry. They observed that chronic promotion focus was associated with greater left frontal activity, whereas chronic prevention focus was associated with greater right frontal activity. Cunningham et al. ( ) found that neural activation when making good/bad judgments differed by individuals' regulatory focus: chronic promotion focus was associated with greater activation in the amygdala, anterior cingulate, and extrastriate cortex following positive stimuli, and chronic prevention focus was associated with activity in the same regions for negative stimuli. Touryan et al. ( ) also used fMRI to study the impact of individual differences in regulatory focus on memory for emotional words. They observed that activity in posterior cingulate cortex, associated with self-referential processing, was greater for correctly remembered stimulus words when they were consistent with an individual's regulatory focus. Packer and Cunningham ( ) investigated how regulatory focus interacted with reflection on personal goals and observed differential activation patterns according to goal domain (promotion vs. prevention) and temporal distance (short-term vs. longer-term). \n\nTwo studies have used idiographically selected promotion and prevention goals as stimuli within fMRI designs. Eddington et al. ( ) used incidental semantic priming via a \u201cdepth of processing\u201d judgment task to examine patterns of cortical activation associated with promotion and prevention goals. An area of left PFC was activated during promotion goal priming across all four judgment tasks, and the magnitude of activation in this region was correlated significantly with individual differences in strength of orientation to promotion goals. In contrast, activation at this site did not correlate significantly with orientation to prevention goals or with individual differences in BAS/BIS strength. Eddington et al. ( ) examined the neural correlates of promotion and prevention goal priming in a sample of unmedicated adult patients meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as an age- and gender-matched control sample of adults with no psychiatric history, using the same judgment task. They hypothesized that MDD patients would show an attenuated left PFC response to promotion priming compared to the non-depressed controls. There was a significant difference in activation between the depressed and non-depressed groups following promotion goal priming, with controls showing greater left medial orbital PFC activation following promotion priming than the depressed patients. In addition, a region in right PFC was activated following prevention priming among MDD patients with comorbid anxiety. \n\nThe findings to date suggest that promotion and prevention may be associated with distinct patterns of neural activation, but none of the prior studies was designed specifically to address that question. In the present study, we adapted an fMRI paradigm developed by Diaz and McCarthy ( ) for rapid masked presentation of semantic stimuli. Masking provides a method for identifying cognitive processes that are preattentive, routinized, and automatic (Dehaene et al.,  ). The use of rapid masked idiographic goal priming offers several significant advantages. First, promotion and prevention goals can be activated automatically like other highly accessible social constructs (i.e., without intentional selection of a goal upon which to focus one's efforts); therefore, a paradigm that would allow detection of implicit priming effects was highly desirable. Second, the two studies by Eddington and colleagues were restricted in the number of goal priming trials included because individuals typically describe a small number of motivationally significant personal goals, thereby limiting the number of goal words available for use as explicit priming stimuli. The use of rapid masked stimulus presentation allows for a greater number of trials within an event-related design (in part because stimuli can be repeated more frequently). Third, because the participant's task in the Diaz and McCarthy paradigm is simply to make a response whenever she/he sees a non-word stimulus in color (e.g., ampersands in red font), a task that was non-self-referential, there is less potential for overlap or interference between the experimental task and priming-based activation of idiographically selected promotion and prevention goals. \n\nUsing this paradigm, we explored three aspects of the neural correlates of promotion and prevention goal representations. First, we examined whether BOLD activation patterns would differ for idiographic priming of promotion goals vs. prevention goals. Second, we examined whether activation in regions associated with promotion/prevention goal priming would be correlated with ratings of perceived success pursuing goals and/or BAS/BIS strength. Third, we examined whether the activation patterns observed following promotion and/or prevention goal priming would be modulated by the individual's current level of negative affect, specifically dysphoric and anxious symptoms. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Overview \n  \nBased on an event-related fMRI paradigm developed by Diaz and McCarthy ( ), participants were exposed to a continuing series of rapidly presented masked visual stimuli including (1) a subset of each participant's ideal and ought goals assessed in a prior session, (2) ideal and ought goals of a different participant (as a yoked-control condition), and (3) non-word letter strings. Participants were told that the task was to respond as quickly as possible whenever they detected a string of letters or symbols presented in a colored font. The detection task was actually a means to keep participants attending to the continuous stimulus presentation. BOLD signal responses to ideal and ought goals were contrasted with responses to control words to test hypotheses about neural correlates of personal goal activation. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were recruited through the introductory psychology research pool at Duke University and were part of a larger sample (  N   = 75) who had completed a study earlier in the semester. The initial study session, described as an investigation of personality, included several self-report measures relevant to the present research. Approximately two months after the personality study, potential subjects were contacted by phone and invited to participate in what was described as an investigation of visual attention. Thirty-three students (16 male) agreed to participate; one withdrew from the study prior to the MRI session for medical reasons, and a second student's imaging data were unusable due to technical problems; thus, data from 31 participants were included in analyses. All participants were between the ages of 18 and 22 and were right-handed as indicated by self-report. Participants reported normal neurological history and had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. All participants gave informed consent in accordance with Duke University Institutional Review Board guidelines and received cash payment as compensation for their time. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \n#### Individual difference measures \n  \nDuring the personality study session, participants completed a measure of chronic regulatory focus, a measure of temperament-based approach and avoidance tendencies, and two measures of distress. The   Regulatory Focus Questionnaire   (RFQ; Higgins et al.,  ) is a 22-item Likert-style instrument designed to measure individual differences in orientation toward promotion and prevention goals. The RFQ contains four scales (two each for promotion and prevention): two   history   scales measuring the extent to which the individual's socialization history was characterized by an emphasis on promotion or prevention goals, and two   success   scales measuring the extent to which the individual believes she/he has been successful in attaining promotion or prevention goals. Because the psychometric properties of the history scales have yet to be determined, only the success scales were used in the present study. Sample items include: \u201cI feel like I have made progress toward being successful in my life\u201d (promotion success); and \u201cNot being careful enough has gotten me into trouble at times\u201d (prevention success\u2014reverse-scored). Higgins et al. ( ) reported that the success scales had internal consistency reliability (coefficient alpha) of 0.75 or higher, and a 2-month test-retest reliability (Pearson correlation) of 0.79 or higher. \n\nThe   BIS/BAS Scale   (BIS/BAS; Carver and White,  ) is a well-validated instrument containing four scales to measure individual differences in BAS and BIS sensitivity: BIS subscale (coefficient alpha = 0.74), BAS reward responsiveness subscale (coefficient alpha = 0.73), BAS drive subscale (coefficient alpha = 0.76), and BAS fun-seeking subscale (coefficient alpha = 0.66). We report results for a general BAS principal component score combining all three BAS subscales. \n\nThe   Beck Depression Inventory   (BDI; Beck et al.,  ) is a widely used 21-item measure of depressive and dysphoric symptoms. Respondents are asked to endorse items varying in severity from (0) to (3) in a number of life areas. For example, \u201cI do not feel sad\u201d scored (0); and \u201cI am so sad or unhappy that I can't stand it\u201d scored (3). The highest rating for each item was summed across all 21 items to create a continuous measure of depressive symptoms. \n\nThe   State Trait Anxiety Inventory   (STAI; Spielberger et al.,  ) is a self-report assessment which includes separate measures of state anxiety and the more general quality of trait anxiety. Participants completed only the trait version for the current investigation. The essential qualities evaluated by the 20-item STAI-T scale are feelings of apprehension, tension, nervousness, and worry (e.g., \u201cI am jittery\u201d). Items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (  not at all  ) to 4 (  very much so  ) and summed to create a scale score. Given the high correlations for the BDI and STAI in this sample (  r   = 0.75), and our anticipation that we would not find distinct patterns of dysphoric vs. anxious affect in this unselected sample of healthy college students (Nitschke et al.,  ), the two scales were combined by summing individual scale z-scores into a single dysphoric/anxious index representing current level of negative affect. \n\n\n#### Promotion and prevention goal generation and selection \n  \nDuring the personality study session, participants also completed a computerized version of the   Selves Questionnaire   (SQ; Higgins et al.,  ). The SQ is a semi-structured measure that was used to sample participants' own promotion and prevention goals. Participants listed traits or attributes for two different self-state representations: the attributes of the kind of person they ideally would like to be (ideal self-guides, which function as promotion goals) and the attributes of the kind of person they believe it is their obligation or responsibility to be (ought self-guides, which function as prevention goals). Personal goal stimuli for the priming task were obtained from each participant's responses to the computerized SQ. Following the procedures used by Strauman ( ), four promotion goals (\u201cideal self\u201d responses) and four prevention goals (\u201cought self\u201d responses) that were semantically unrelated were identified for each participant from among that participant's total set of SQ responses. All of the goals selected from participants' SQ responses were positively valenced. Then the promotion and prevention goals were pooled across subjects, and for each participant a set of eight yoked-control words was selected from that pool so that each yoked-control word was semantically unrelated to all of the participant's promotion and prevention goals. The yoked-control priming condition was included to rule out the alternative hypothesis that the semantic content of an ideal or ought word, rather than its status as a personal goal, might account for the activation observed following a priming trial. \n\n\n#### Goal priming task \n  \nThe fMRI task was adapted from Diaz and McCarthy ( ). Participants viewed a continuous stream of masked words and non-words while performing a detection task in which they were asked to make a response to a visible colored non-word stimulus (e.g., percent signs in red font). The detection task ensured participant engagement, while the non-word priming controlled for perceptual and orthographic processing. The masked word stimuli were of three types: a subset of the participant's promotion (ideal) goals, a subset of the participant's prevention (ought) goals, and yoked-control words (ideal and ought goals of other participants which had no self-regulatory significance for the participant her/himself). Three runs, each 600 s in length, were conducted. The stimuli for each run consisted of words (ideal goals, ought goals, or a yoked-control word) and non-word letter strings that were masked and displayed in a fixed width font. All goal words (ideal, ought, and yoked-control) were positively valenced trait attributes. The non-words were random consonant strings, each 4\u201310 characters in length. Each letter string was padded with pound signs so that letters were centered and each stimulus was 12 characters in length, in order to ensure that the same amount of the visual field was occupied on any given priming trial. \n\nFigure   presents an example sequence of priming trials within the overall experimental design as viewed by each participant. Participants viewed a constantly changing visual display in which a stimulus was presented every 1500 ms for a duration of 33 ms. The majority of the trials were masked non-words; a masked word from one of the three remaining stimulus conditions was presented approximately every 12 s. In each run, 16 ideal priming trials, 16 ought priming trials, and 16 yoked-control priming trials were included. All word and non-word letter strings were preceded and followed by pound sign strings for 155 ms, which served as pattern masks. In turn, the pound sign strings alternated with percent sign strings such that the subject was exposed to a continuously changing visual stream. The masked non-word trials ensured that brain regions responsive to physical features and orthography would be continuously active. Any brain region that was responsive to one of the three word priming conditions therefore reflected a higher level of cognitive processing. Participants were instructed to press a button when they detected a letter or symbol string presented in a color font. Those target events occurred infrequently (mean interval = 25 s) and were not in close temporal proximity to word priming trials. All stimuli were displayed on MRI-compatible LCD goggles. \n  \n Schematic of the experimental task, displaying a typical sequence of priming trials.   The sequence for an individual trial consisted of alternating pound signs and percent signs, in between which a word or non-word was inserted. Promotion goal, prevention goal, and yoked-control priming stimuli were inserted throughout the run. Incidental to those stimuli visible colored symbol stimuli were displayed to which participants were instructed to respond with a button press as quickly as possible. \n  \n\n#### Manipulation check \n  \nThe participants were not informed that words or non-words would be presented. In order to evaluate subjects' perceptions of the masked stimuli, both subjective and objective assessments were conducted. Prior to imaging, participants were shown individual masked trials and were asked to report \u201canything and everything that you see.\u201d No participant reported seeing words, and most simply reported that they saw rapidly flashing strings of pound signs or percent signs. After the three runs were completed, subjects again were questioned about what they experienced and then completed a brief questionnaire in which both words that had been presented in each of the three word priming conditions and an equal number of words that had not been presented were listed. Participants were told that during the task they had been exposed periodically to words and were asked to indicate whether they believed each word had been presented or not. No participant performed significantly beyond chance levels in identifying presented vs. not-presented words. \n\n\n#### fMRI parameters and data processing \n  \nFunctional images sensitive to blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast were acquired using an inverse spiral pulse sequence (TR, 1.5 s; TE, 35 ms; FOV, 24 cm; image matrix, 64 ; 34 contiguous axial slices; voxel size 3.75 \u00d7 3.75 \u00d7 3.8 mm) on the research-dedicated 3.0 Tesla GE Signa EXCITE HD system at Duke's Brain Imaging and Analysis Center (BIAC:  ). The 3.0 T has an eight-channel head coil for parallel imaging at high bandwidth up to 1 MHz, in addition to its volume birdcage head coil. Each of the three runs consisted of the acquisition of a time series of 242 brain volumes (TR = 1.5 s, run length = 363 s). Four initial RF excitations were performed (and discarded) to achieve steady state equilibrium. High-resolution structural images were acquired using a 3D fast SPGR pulse sequence (TR, 12.2 ms; TE, 5.3 ms; FOV, 24 cm; image matrix, 256 ; voxel size 0.9375 \u00d7 0.9375 \u00d7 1.9 mm). A semi-automated high-order shimming program was used to ensure global field homogeneity. \n\nAnalyses of the BOLD signal were conducted using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool; Smith et al.,  ; Woolrich et al.,  ), part of FSL (FMRIB's Software Library, Oxford University;  ). The following pre-statistics processing steps were applied: motion correction using MCFLIRT, slice-timing correction, removal of non-brain voxels using BET, spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 8 mm, and high-pass temporal filtering with a cutoff of 100 s. Registration to high resolution and standard images was carried out using FLIRT. \n\n\n#### Statistical analyses \n  \nAnalyses were conducted to identify regions reliably activated by ideal and ought goal priming respectively, and each proceeded in three stages. First, preprocessed functional data were analyzed using a general linear model with local autocorrelation correction (Woolrich et al.,  ). For each run, we set up separate regressors for promotion (ideal), prevention (ought), yoked-control, and non-word primes. A nuisance regressor modeled the target detection component of the task. All regressors consisted of unit impulses convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. The contrast of interests were comparing ideal vs. control and ought vs. control priming. We then combined data across runs for each subject using a fixed-effects model, and combined data across subjects using a mixed-effects model (Beckmann et al.,  ; Woolrich et al.,  ). We also used the mixed-effects models to obtain statistical tests for whether the two individual differences measures of interest (promotion/prevention success and BAS/BIS strength) and the dysphoric/anxious symptom index significantly modulated activation following goal priming. All   z  -statistic (Gaussianised   t  ) images were thresholded using clusters determined by   z   > 2.3 and a corrected cluster-significance threshold of   p   < 0.05 (Worsley,  ). As Brodmann labels can be somewhat misleading (Zilles and Amunts,  ), we report probabilistic anatomical labels for local maxima within statistically significant clusters derived from the Harvard-Oxford Cortical and Subcortical Structural Atlases along with approximate Brodmann areas. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### BOLD activation: promotion > control priming \n  \nWe analyzed the fMRI data for promotion goal priming by contrasting responses to ideal priming with responses to yoked-control priming. As shown in Table  ; Figure  , we found two brain regions that responded significantly more in response to ideal primes than to yoked-control primes, constituting main effects for promotion priming. The first cluster included occipital pole and lingual gyrus (both bilateral, approximately BA 18). The second cluster, predominantly left-sided, included subcallosal cortex (approximately BA 11/25), caudate, and thalamus. \n  \n Regions showing significantly greater activation following promotion (ideal) priming trials compared to control priming trials  . \n  \nCoordinates of local maxima within each cluster of activation are in MNI space. Probabilistic labels reflect the likelihood that a coordinate belongs to a given region; for clarity, only labels whose likelihood exceeds 5% are shown. \n    \n Rapid masked promotion and prevention goal priming induced distinct patterns of activation. (A)   To identify brain regions associated with activation of a promotion goal, we contrasted ideal goal priming vs. control priming. There was a significant effect for promotion goal priming in both subcallosal cortex and lingual gyrus (shown in blue). Likewise, to identify brain regions associated with activation of a prevention goal, we contrasted ought goal priming vs. control priming. There was a significant effect for prevention goal priming in precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus (shown in red).   (B)   The chart displays mean standardized parameter estimates (PEs) at selected sites for the ideal vs. control contrast as well as the ought vs. control contrast. Within the subcallosal cortex (  x   \u2212 10,   y  26,   z   \u2212 10), activation was significant greater in response to ideal priming (vs. control priming). Within the precuneus (  x   \u2212 32,   y  14,   z  46), activation was significantly greater in response to ought priming (vs. control priming). \n  \nWe then repeated the analysis including covariates representing individual differences in self-regulation, BAS/BIS, and current level of dysphoric/anxious symptoms (see below) to determine whether responses to ideal priming were modulated by any of these variables. There were no significant findings for BAS or BIS strength, but we found two areas in which activation for ideal primes compared to yoked-control primes increased as individuals reported   higher   levels of success attaining   promotion   goals (Table  ; Figure  ). The first cluster included bilateral precuneus cortex (approximately BA 7) and bilateral posterior and anterior cingulate cortex (approximately BA 23 and 31). The second cluster included bilateral caudate and thalamus. \n  \n Regions showing significantly greater activation following prevention (ought) priming trials compared to control priming trials  . \n  \nCoordinates of local maxima within each cluster of activation are in MNI space. Probabilistic labels reflect the likelihood that a coordinate belongs to a given region; for clarity, only labels whose likelihood exceeds 5% are shown. \n    \n BOLD responses to promotion goal priming were modulated by individual differences in self-reported success pursuing promotion goals and by scores on the symptom index. (A)   For the ideal > control contrast, symptom index scores were positively correlated with activation in frontal pole and paracingulate gyrus.   (B)   The scatterplot displays mean standardized PEs at the right frontal pole (  x  8,   y  40,   z  52) as a function of symptom index scores.   (C)   For the ideal > control contrast, promotion success scores were positively correlated with activation in precuneus, posterior cingulate, and other regions.   (D)   The scatterplot displays mean standardized PEs at the left precuneus (  x   \u2212 8,   y   \u2212 74,   z  36) as a function of promotion success scores. \n  \n\n### BOLD activation: prevention > control priming \n  \nWe analyzed the fMRI data for prevention goal priming by contrasting responses to ought priming with responses to yoked-control priming. As shown in Table  ; Figure  , we found a cluster comprised of two subregions constituting main effects of prevention priming that responded significantly more to ought primes than to yoked-control primes: left and right precuneus cortex (approximately BA 7) and left and right posterior cingulate gyrus (approximately BA 31). \n\nWe then repeated the analysis including the covariates described above. Again there were no significant findings for BAS or BIS strength, but we found a cluster in which response to ought primes relative to yoked-control primes increased as individuals reported   higher   levels of success attaining   prevention   goals (Table  ; Figure  ). That cluster, which was entirely right-sided, included lateral occipital cortex (approximately BA 7), angular gyrus (approximately BA 40), precuneus cortex (approximately BA 31), and superior parietal lobule (also approximately BA 7). We also found a cluster in which response to ought primes relative to yoked-control primes increased as individuals reported   lower   levels of success attaining   promotion   goals. That cluster, which was entirely left-sided, included superior frontal gyrus (approximately BA 8) and middle frontal gyrus (approximately BA 6). \n  \n BOLD responses to prevention goal priming were modulated by individual differences in self-reported success pursuing both types of personal goals. (A)   For the ought > control contrast, promotion success scores were negatively correlated with activation in middle (MFG) and superior frontal gyrus.   (B)   The scatterplot displays mean standardized PEs at the left middle frontal gyrus (  x   \u2212 32,   y  14,   z  46) as a function of promotion success scores.   (C)   For the ought > control contrast, prevention success scores were positively correlated with activation in lateral occipital cortex (LOC) and other regions.   (D)   The scatterplot displays mean standardized PEs at the right LOC (  x  36,   y   \u2212 70,   z  54) as a function of prevention success scores. \n  \n\n### Goal priming BOLD responses modulation by negative affect \n  \nIn order to determine whether responses to ideal priming were modulated by current distress level, we also included the dysphoric/anxious index within the ideal vs. control contrast analysis as a covariate. As shown in Table  , we found a cluster that showed a significantly greater response to ideal primes than to yoked-control primes as individuals reported higher levels of negative affect. This bilateral cluster included the frontal pole (approximately BA 8) and paracingulate gyrus (approximately BA 9 and 10). There were no regions identified in this analysis where activation was negatively correlated with the symptom index. We also had included the dysphoric/anxious index as a covariate within the ought vs. control contrast. However, we found no regions where there was significantly greater activation in response to ought vs. yoked-control priming as a function of negative affect. \n  \n Regions showing significantly activation positively correlated with symptom index scores following promotion (ideal) priming trials compared to control priming trials  . \n  \nCoordinates of local maxima within each cluster of activation are in MNI space. Probabilistic labels reflect the likelihood that a coordinate belongs to a given region; for clarity, only labels whose likelihood exceeds 5% are shown. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nDespite their centrality for behavior, motivation, mood, and identity, only recently have personal goals such as hopes, dreams, and obligations been examined from a cognitive neuroscience perspective. Personal goals are similar to more concrete, situation-specific goals in that they frequently entail either approach or avoidance, but they are distinct with regard to their abstractness, their motivational significance, and their centrality to the self. In this study, we explored the neural correlates of two classes of personal goals: promotion goals, which represent desired outcomes that an individual would attain by \u201cmaking good things happen,\u201d and prevention goals, which also represent desired outcomes but which are attained by \u201ckeeping bad things from happening.\u201d Using rapid masked priming with idiographically selected ideal and ought goals (both of which are desired personal attributes), we observed distinct neural activation patterns for the two goal types. In addition, we found that activation following goal priming is modulated by individual differences in perceived success of promotion and prevention goal attainment (but not BAS/BIS strength) as well as by current level of negative affect. Promotion and prevention goals have distinct neural correlates, in keeping with the behavioral distinctions between the two hypothesized motivational systems. \n\nThe activation patterns from the ideal > control and ought > control contrasts were reliably distinguishable and were most closely associated with the cortical midline structures model of the self (Northoff and Bermpohl,  ). Nonetheless, it may be more accurate to say that priming of ideal and ought goals activated regions known to be associated with a key psychological process that RFT would predict is relevant: namely, the representation of desired outcomes for the self. We did not observe activation of regions most frequently associated with responses to spatiotemporal cues for either reward (e.g., ventral striatum) or threat (e.g., amygdala). Thus, the data are more consistent with a model organized primarily around personal goals as aspects of identity than a model of approach/avoidance or positive/negative affectivity. Of course, this could reflect the paradigm itself, particularly since our intent was to examine goal priming   per se   rather than a more extended cycle of ongoing self-evaluation triggered by the presence of a discrete cue for reward or threat. \n\nWe observed that promotion goal priming led to activation in frontal and occipital regions as well as caudate and thalamus, whereas prevention goal priming was associated with activation in precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, individual differences in self-perceived success vs. failure to attain promotion and prevention goals were correlated with activation in specific regions that were differentially responsive to promotion vs. prevention goal priming. For those individuals with higher scores on the promotion success scale, the ideal > control contrast was associated with activation in additional regions including bilateral precuneus and both anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (proximal to, but not identical to, the loci observed for the main effect of the ought > control contrast). For participants scoring higher on the prevention success scale, ought goal priming was associated with activation in right occipital and parietal regions. Additionally, a correlation was observed between lower scores on the promotion success scale and left prefrontal activation following priming with ought goals. \n\nThe differences in activation observed for the two classes of personal goals were striking given that both sets of stimuli were self-generated by participants, both were self-descriptive, both were positively valenced, and both represented the kind of person the individual wanted to become. The only difference between the two stimulus sets was the kind of personal goal they represented\u2014in one case (ideal), the individual's hopes, aspirations, and desired accomplishments, and in the other (ought), the individual's sense of duties, obligations, and responsibilities. In fact the same personal goal\u2014for instance, to be successful\u2014could be a promotion goal for one person and a prevention goal for another. RFT would predict that in such an instance, although the goal itself is identical, the motivational impetus, cognitive strategies, behavioral means, and affective responses to goal pursuit would differ radically. For the former individual, being successful would be attained by a strategic emphasis on accomplishment or being the best one could be, whereas for the latter, being successful would be attained by meeting one's responsibilities and obligations. Our findings provide evidence that the distinction between promotion and prevention goals is evident in terms of neural correlates from the moment such a goal is activated by a contextual cue. \n\nThe activation patterns associated with each type of personal goal involved regions within the cortical midline structures associated with self-referential processing as well as regions linked to other aspects of self-regulation (Amodio and Frith,  ; Beer et al.,  ; Heatherton,  ). For example, promotion goal priming-activated areas within orbital and medial PFC, both of which have been reliably demonstrated to be linked to a range of self-referential mental processes, including representation and monitoring of self-referential knowledge (Northoff and Bermpohl,  ). Promotion priming also was associated with activation in the caudate and thalamus, which have been identified as components of both intuition and implicit learning as well as broader networks underlying reward sensitivity, preparatory motor functions, social judgment, and goal pursuit behavior (e.g., Lieberman,  ; Rameson et al.,  ). The greater caudate activation associated with ideal priming among high-success individuals also may reflect the role of the caudate in reward learning and appetitive goal pursuit. Thus, ideals may engage regions that subserve representation and pursuit of abstract positive outcomes via direct, task-focused activity. In contrast, prevention goal priming was associated with activation in precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus, which are implicated in the default mode network (e.g., Buckner et al.,  ) but also in phenomena such as self-reflection, self-awareness, and social adaptation (Pearson et al.,  ). As such, oughts may engage regions that support third-person perspective and moral reasoning. \n\nDo the observed findings correspond to our knowledge of how individuals represent and pursue their goals? Given the likelihood that human psychological capabilities evolved in response to an increasingly complex social environment (Leary,  ), activities such as the pursuit of personal goals would of necessity incorporate cognitive processes involving representations of self and significant others (Derryberry and Reed,  ). In order for humans to survive and thrive, they must be not only capable of effective responses to survival-relevant stimuli. They also must be capable of representing and pursuing higher-order, cross-situational, socially embedded goals, and the representational, monitoring, and evaluative functions required must be integrated into coherent brain/behavior systems (Mischel,  ). For the higher-order personal goals that people pursue, there is no necessarily spatiotemporal \u201cmoving toward or away from\u201d; rather, the strategies people use involve \u201cbringing about\u201d or \u201cmaking happen\u201d (Carver and Scheier,  ). This phenomenological distinction raises the possibility that brain/behavior systems for   strategic   approach and avoidance, such as are postulated in RFT, would be functionally discriminable from those for spatiotemporal approach and avoidance. For example, personal goals such as being successful, or intelligent, or trustworthy require a top-down coordination that brings relevant concrete goal representations into working memory across a range of situations (Carver and Scheier,  ). The present data could be interpreted as reflecting how such top-down coordination is manifested differentially within the brain when promotion or prevention self-regulation is engaged. \n\nOur findings were somewhat different from those reported by Eddington et al. ( ,  ), especially in the case of promotion priming, where left orbital prefrontal activation was found to be discriminantly associated with promotion goal cues which had been presented in the context of a self-reference judgment task. We see the distinctions between the two sets of findings as primarily reflecting differences in the experimental paradigm used. Eddington et al. ( ,  ) used a task that had been designed to identify neural signatures of explicit self-referential processing; they simply included a set of idiographically selected ideal and ought attributes within the stimuli used for the judgment task. Their findings, in essence, revealed a promotion-goal-specific activation pattern which was embedded within an instructional set emphasizing self-descriptiveness and requiring a specific judgment. In contrast, the rapid masked priming paradigm in the present study was selected so that goal-related activation patterns could be observed without the potentially complicating factor of an explicit self-evaluation in reference to the goal being primed. The distinction between the activation patterns found by Eddington and colleagues and those observed in the present study warrants additional study. \n\nBased on these findings, does RFT help to refine our knowledge of the brain regions involved in the representation of personal goals? We suggest that in terms of the postulated distinctions between promotion and prevention, the answer is a qualified yes. The psychological dynamics of the promotion system can be viewed in signal detection terms (Tanner and Swets,  ; Trope and Liberman,  ), particularly as involving eagerness, which increases with greater proximity (in this case, conceptually or symbolically rather than spatiotemporally) to the target (Higgins,  ). As such, we postulate that self-reflection may be less central to promotion-based goal pursuit, since promotion goals \u201cloom larger\u201d as the individual gets closer to attaining them (Higgins,  ), and indeed we did not observe main effects of promotion-triggered activation in posterior midline structures associated with self-reflective thought. \n\nPrevention system dynamics also can be viewed in signal detection terms, with the system organized to avoid errors of commission (albeit still in the service of ultimately attaining a positive end-state). As such, the prevention system relies upon vigilance as the dominant motivational state and self-evaluation as a recursive cognitive process. Consistent with this characterization, prevention goal priming was associated with activation in areas engaged by tasks that require self-reflection and even self-awareness, as well as by decisions involving judgments of morality and principle (e.g., Greene and Haidt,  ). Such processes are of primary relevance to the pursuit of personal goals that are construed in terms of obligation, responsibility, or a sense of \u201cshould\u201d (Higgins,  ). \n\nOf course, the findings do not represent a self-contained set of brain/behavior systems associated with personal goal pursuit. Self-regulation is too complex and multifaceted to be modeled adequately by a single experimental task. It would have been unlikely to find activation in areas associated with psychological processes that are substantially \u201cdownstream\u201d from goal activation, such as consummatory behavior, goal disengagement, or affect regulation. Nonetheless, the activation patterns immediately following promotion and prevention goal priming were discriminable, and the rapid masked priming technique provided sufficient sensitivity to detect those patterns\u2014which appeared to be broadly consistent with RFT's conceptualizations for each system. \n\nWe also observed that individual differences in self-reported success pursuing a particular kind of goal predicted activation following priming with idiographic exemplars of such goals, whereas individual differences in temperament-based approach and avoidance tendencies (operationalized using the Carver and White BIS/BAS Scales) did not. The behavioral activation and inhibition systems are hypothesized to represent inborn, presumably genetically determined variation in sensitivity to cues for spatiotemporal approach/avoidance behavior and/or the intensity and duration of behavioral responses to such cues. In contrast, individual differences in the strength of the promotion and prevention systems have been linked to socialization (Manian et al.,  ), and in particular to variability in the messages parents convey to their children about the relative importance of making good things happen vs. keeping bad things from happening. Strauman and Wilson ( ) postulated that the two sets of systems have different phylogenetic and developmental origins as well as distinguishable functions. Whereas BAS and BIS appear to operate in response to immediate, concrete cues for reward and danger respectively, promotion and prevention operate as \u201cworld views\u201d or cognitive styles and provide a functional link between pursuit of higher-order personal goals and the social world. Eddington et al. ( ) reported that the Carver and White scales did not predict neural responses to promotion or prevention goal priming, and the present data are in concordance with their findings. Together, the two studies provide evidence that the neurobiological bases of BAS/BIS and promotion/prevention are likely to be distinct\u2014and offer the possibility that the two sets of systems interact in complex ways to influence goal-directed behavior in any specific situation. \n\nBoth RFT and its precursor, self-discrepancy theory (Higgins,  ), predict that perceived lack of progress toward a motivationally significant personal goal would be associated with negative affect. Both theories also postulate that chronic distress, as well as emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety, can interfere with effective goal pursuit (Strauman,  ). To explore the impact of negative affect on personal goal activation, we examined whether individual variability in negative affect (assessed by creating a dysphoric/anxious index from the BDI and STAI) would predict neural responses to promotion or prevention goal priming. For individuals reporting greater levels of distress, promotion priming was associated with additional activation in the bilateral frontal pole and paracingulate gyrus. Prevention goal priming did not reveal any regions where activation was modulated by self-reported distress. \n\nWhat might this pattern of results signify about the influence of chronic distress on self-regulation? Level of negative affect was associated with greater recruitment of bilateral frontal regions in response to cues for \u201cmaking good things happen,\u201d suggesting that higher levels of distress could introduce a greater degree of recruitment of prefrontal regions in the goal pursuit process. More speculatively, such increased frontal activity could signify activation of negative cognitive schemas, as hypothesized in cognitive models of depression (e.g., Beck et al.,  ), which would be likely to interfere with effective strategic pursuit of promotion goals. The nature of the promotion system dictates that the individual's optimal strategy is to ignore errors or unsuccessful trials and continue with goal pursuit efforts. Too much engagement of self-evaluation would complicate goal pursuit efforts by diverting processing resources away from the eager motivational state that characterizes successful promotion goal pursuit. The study was not intended to explore clinically relevant emotional states and symptom patterns, and it may be premature to extrapolate these findings to depression and related internalizing disorders. Still, the modulation of neural response to ideal priming by negative affect was robust enough to emerge from an analysis that included other statistically significant covariates. \n\nIn summary, the rapid masked stimulus presentation technique that we used to prime participants' promotion and prevention goals led to interpretable and reliably distinguishable patterns of neural activation. The findings are broadly consistent with established findings from the social neuroscience literature, and the discriminability of the activation patterns associated with the two types of personal goals provides support for the critical distinction in RFT between promotion and prevention as modes of self-regulation. To the extent that those modes become automatic and systematized over time, then perhaps it will be of value to speak of promotion and prevention \u201csystems\u201d assuming that present data are replicated using other goal-relevant tasks. Furthermore, to the extent that individual differences relevant to self-regulation of personal goal pursuit might be expected to influence the strength and accessibility of the two systems, our findings also were consistent with the view that the neural correlates of the systems may differ as a function of individuals' beliefs about their success vs. failure in attaining such goals. \n\nWe close with several comments about the limitations of the present research and its potential implications for future studies. As noted previously, the priming paradigm may be a reasonable operationalization of one phase of a self-regulatory cycle\u2014automatic activation of goal pursuit via exposure to a goal-relevant cue\u2014but it would not be likely to identify neural responses to other phases of that cycle, such as regulation of affect in response to goal pursuit feedback or other conscious processes. Likewise, we did not systematically choose the participants on the basis of potentially relevant individual differences, and the priming task did not explicitly target such individual variability. Our analyses of those individual differences (in regulatory focus, in BAS/BIS strength, and in chronic distress) are correlational and represent first steps in an ongoing process of investigation. It should be emphasized that the promotion and prevention systems are constructs, in the same way as more familiar brain/behavior systems. We are using those constructs to guide prediction and interpretation but not making claims about neural structure or neuroanatomical connectivity. Nonetheless, we offer these findings as, to our knowledge, the first neuroimaging evidence for the construct validity of the promotion and prevention systems and the critical roles that individual differences and chronic affective states play in the day-to-day function of those systems. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nProbabilistic anatomical label\tx\ty\tz\tZ statistic\tCluster volume (p)\nMAIN EFFECT FOR CONTRAST\tMAIN EFFECT FOR CONTRAST\tMAIN EFFECT FOR CONTRAST\tMAIN EFFECT FOR CONTRAST\tMAIN EFFECT FOR CONTRAST\tMAIN EFFECT FOR CONTRAST\nOccipital pole (57%), supercalcarine cortex (6%)\t4\t\u221294\t18\t3.89\t2451 mm3 (p < 0.01)\nLingual gyrus (70%)\t2\t\u221280\t\u22126\t3.41\t\nLingual gyrus (50%)\t\u22128\t\u221266\t\u22128\t3.29\t\nLingual gyrus (17%)\t\u22126\t\u221270\t\u221212\t3.10\t\nLingual gyrus (69%), intracalcarine cortex (16%)\t2\t\u221274\t2\t3.08\t\nLingual gyrus (5%)\t0\t\u221268\t\u22128\t3.00\t\nParacingulate gyrus (10%)\t\u221214\t44\t\u22124\t3.90\t1677 mm3 (p < 0.05)\nSubcallosal cortex (14%)\t\u221212\t26\t\u22124\t3.78\t\nSubcallosal cortex (60%)\t0\t12\t\u22124\t3.70\t\nThalamus (98%)\t4\t\u221218\t8\t3.68\t\nSubcallosal cortex (54%)\t\u221210\t26\t\u221210\t3.53\t\nSubcallosal cortex (45%)\t\u22126\t24\t\u22124\t3.48\t\nPOSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH PROMOTION SUCCESS SCORE\tPOSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH PROMOTION SUCCESS SCORE\tPOSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH PROMOTION SUCCESS SCORE\tPOSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH PROMOTION SUCCESS SCORE\tPOSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH PROMOTION SUCCESS SCORE\tPOSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH PROMOTION SUCCESS SCORE\nPrecuneus cortex (41%), cuneal cortex (9%)\t\u22128\t\u221274\t36\t4.02\t2878 mm3 (p < 0.01)\nPosterior cingulate gyrus (37%)\t\u221210\t\u221234\t38\t3.95\t\nPrecuneus cortex (42%), posterior cingulate gyrus (42%)\t\u22122\t\u221254\t18\t3.35\t\nPosterior cingulate gyrus (72%), anterior cingulate gyrus (21%)\t0\t\u221218\t40\t3.16\t\nPrecuneus cortex (51%), posterior cingulate gyrus (6%)\t6\t\u221256\t16\t3.14\t\nSuperior parietal lobule (8%), angular gyrus (6%)\t\u221230\t\u221252\t34\t3.09\t\nRight caudate (93%)\t10\t16\t6\t3.71\t2138 mm3 (p < 0.01)\nLeft caudate (45%)\t\u221224\t\u221228\t12\t3.45\t\nLeft thalamus (38%)\t\u22122\t\u221226\t6\t3.34\t\nRight thalamus (100%)\t6\t\u221216\t10\t3.27\t\nLeft thalamus (88%)\t\u22124\t\u221224\t2\t3.10\t\n### Caption\nRegions showing significantly greater activation following promotion (ideal) priming trials compared to control priming trials.\n### Footer\nCoordinates of local maxima within each cluster of activation are in MNI space.

Focusing on homogenous ET patients diagnosed according to the 2018 consensus criteria, this study aimed to: (1) investigate whether task functional MRI (fMRI) can identify networks of activated and deactivated brain areas, (2) characterize morphometric and functional modulations, relative to healthy controls (HC). Ten ET patients and ten HC underwent fMRI while performing two motor tasks with their upper limb: (1) maintaining a posture (both groups); (2) simulating tremor (HC only). Activations/deactivations were obtained from General Linear Model and compared across groups/tasks. Voxel-based morphometry and linear regressions between clinical and fMRI data were also performed. Few cerebellar clusters of gray matter loss were found in ET. Conversely, widespread fMRI alterations were shown. Tremor in ET (task 1) was associated with extensive deactivations mainly involving the cerebellum, sensory-motor cortex, and basal ganglia compared to both tasks in HC, and was negatively correlated with clinical tremor scales. Homogeneous ET patients demonstrated deactivation patterns during tasks triggering tremor, encompassing a network of cortical and subcortical regions. Our results point towards a marked cerebellar involvement in ET pathophysiology and the presence of an impaired cerebello-thalamo-cortical tremor network. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEssential tremor (ET) has recently been redefined as an isolated tremor syndrome characterized by bibrachial postural and/or kinetic tremor which has been present for at least 3\u00a0years and may affect other body parts (e.g. head, voice, lower limbs) but is not associated with other neurological signs (e.g., parkinsonism, dystonia, ataxia) . This is a refinement of previous definitions of ET, in which the coexistence of additional neurological signs of uncertain significance, now labelled as \u201cET plus\u201d, was accepted as ET . Although the revised definition of ET has engendered debate among clinicians and researchers and is considered strict by some , it has some advantages in research settings, where the selection of highly homogeneous cohorts is a pivotal requisite when designing mechanistic studies and clinical trials. \n\nET has an estimated prevalence of nearly 1% in the general population and 5% in people aged 65 and over, thus standing among the most common neurological disorders . Despite its high prevalence, controversy exists on the pathophysiology of ET . Several non-mutually exclusive pathomechanisms have been proposed so far . First, ET might represent a neurodegenerative disease with prominent involvement of the cerebellar cortex in keeping with neuroradiological and pathological evidence . Second, ET could be underpinned by a defective gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission which was demonstrated to partially colocalize with neurodegenerative changes, suggesting that both a reduction in GABA receptor density and alterations in GABA receptor functioning might contribute to lower the GABAergic tone . Third, ET might be secondary to abnormal oscillatory activity within a tremor-generating network including the inferior olive, cerebellum, red nucleus, thalamus, and sensory-motor cortex . \n\nIn this context, advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide novel insights to shed light on the pathophysiology of ET . \n\nFrom a morphological perspective, while post-mortem pathological studies have demonstrated the presence of ET-related changes in cerebellar structures , the assessment of anatomical brain integrity in-vivo is more challenging and has been hampered by the quality of available data. Automatic techniques, such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM), can overcome these issues enabling to quantify local alterations in gray (GM) and white matter (WM) volume without a priori assumptions on tissue composition and to detect subtle alterations that elude visual inspection. However, previous studies relying on VBM to compare ET patients and healthy controls (HC) provided variable and inconsistent findings and call for further research . Indeed, ET has been associated with either GM volume loss in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres alone or along with other brain regions , or no differences in GM volumes , or increased GM volumes of the bilateral cerebellum and right occipital fusiform gyrus . \n\nConsidering this broad spectrum of results, recent studies on ET shifted from the assessment of brain anatomy only to its combination with brain activity information, generally retrieved from functional MRI (fMRI) based on blood-oxygenation-level-dependant (BOLD) contrast. BOLD signals arise from the complex interaction of neuronal, metabolic and vascular processes and therefore provide an indirect measure of neuronal activity . Their acquisition can be obtained while the subject is resting in the scanner (rs-fMRI) or performing a task (task fMRI), conveying different information about the underlying brain activity. Rs-fMRI is a useful approach to explore brain functional organization and connectivity, but despite its undeniable relevance it cannot localize and lateralize spontaneous oscillations associated with different brain functions. Conversely, task fMRI enables to define brain areas which are involved in the execution of specific tasks by revealing perturbations of neuronal activity in terms of both increased (activation) and decreased (deactivation) BOLD signals . Functional evidence currently available on ET mainly derives from rs-fMRI , which demonstrated patterns of aberrant connectivity over several regions of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network. Few studies have hitherto investigated ET using task fMRI, especially in combination with motor tasks, and their findings are largely not comparable. This may reflect inconsistencies in ET patient selection due to the longstanding absence of stringent diagnostic criteria and the lack of ET biomarkers, different MRI field strengths, acquisition schemes (in terms of both paradigms and tasks), and analysis methods . In addition, previous task fMRI studies on ET focused only on BOLD activation patterns and did not explore deactivations, as frequently happened in the broader literature on fMRI. Negative BOLD responses were shown to reflect task-related decreases in neuronal activity compared to the spontaneous activity level at rest , and have been reported in association with different paradigms, especially those requiring a greater task effort . However, controversy still exists on their interpretation and whether deactivations reflect neuronal inhibition or hemodynamic compensatory mechanisms is still unclear, limiting the number of studies currently reporting their BOLD deactivation findings. \n\nOverall, examining brain regions whose activity increases or decreases with tasks is highly important to understand how the brain works, and in the specific context of ET could help to unveil which regions are involved in tremor generation and propagation. Therefore, this study aimed to explore activation and deactivation brain mapping using task fMRI combined with a tremor-inducing motor task in a homogeneous cohort of ET patients diagnosed according to the most recent and stringent criteria . These maps were also assessed with respect to physiological patterns derived from HC, aiming at identifying functionally relevant modulations, and linked to clinical data to assess whether a linear relationship between imaging and clinical manifestation exists. Finally, VBM was performed to quantify possible ET-related changes in terms of GM volume. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Participants \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of patients and controls are reported in Table  . All patients with ET had bilateral arm tremor which was often mildly asymmetrical in amplitude on clinical assessment, being slightly worse in the dominant arm. Two patients showed associated mild head tremor in line with the inclusion criteria, four patients had also vocal tremor, and three patients had lower limb involvement. A family history of postural and/or kinetic tremor of the upper limbs was reported by seven ET patients. Age, gender, handedness, Beck Depression Inventory II score (BDI-II) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score for trait anxiety (form Y2) were not significantly different among the two groups (  p  \u2009>\u20090.05).   \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with essential tremor (ET) and healthy controls (HC). \n  \nResults are provided as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviations and absolute frequencies. \n\nBDI-II, beck depression inventory II (score: 0\u201363; higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms); CAN, cannot answer; ET, patients with essential tremor; F, female; HC, healthy controls; L, left; M, male;   n  , units; NA, not applicable; R, right; STAI Y2, state-trait anxiety inventory form Y2 (score 20\u201380; higher scores indicate more severe trait anxiety); TRS, tremor rating scale (subscore A: 0\u201380, subscore B: 0\u201336, subscore C: 0\u201328, total score: 0\u2013144; higher scores indicate more severe tremor; TRS scores were assessed while patients were off medication). \n\nMann\u2013Whitney U and Fisher\u2019s Exact tests. \n  \n\n\n### VBM analysis \n  \nSignificant volume loss was observed in ET patients compared to HC (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, family-wise-error [FWE]-corrected) as revealed by the VBM analysis. The atrophy pattern predominantly involved the cerebellar structures, revealing four different clusters. The first cluster (  p  \u2009=\u20090.013, 1488 voxels), centered in the left lobule VIIIa, encompassed a broad area across vermis VIIIa, left lobule VIIb and Crus II. The second one (  p  \u2009=\u20090.004, 1050 voxels) involved vermis VIIIa, right Crus II, lobule VIIIa, and lobule VIIb, where the peak voxel was found. The left and right Crus I areas also showed a statistically significant volume reduction in patients relative to HC (  p  \u2009=\u20090.028, 135 voxels and   p  \u2009=\u20090.036, 43 voxels, respectively). In particular, the latter cluster also spread to the right lobule VI. Finally, a single cluster of cortical atrophy of the right occipital fusiform gyrus was found, although being of a limited extent (  p  \u2009=\u20090.043, 14 voxels; Figure  ). \n\nA schematic of the cerebellum, following the FSL probabilistic cerebellar atlas, is shown in Fig.\u00a0  for ease of interpretation.   \nSchematic of the cerebellum.

Indeed, Supplementary Materials Table   shows that the means of the time course for the six movement parameters are limited with no significant group/task differences (  p  \u2009>\u20090.05). \n\nGroup GLM results are summarized in Supplementary Materials Tables  \u2013 , while the statistical comparisons for (de)activations are reported in Tables  \u2013 . In particular, each significant cluster identified by the group/statistical analyses (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWE-corrected) is reported with its name, the number of voxels, the value of the maximum   z  -statistic within the cluster, and the location of the maximum intensity voxel, given as X/Y/Z coordinate values in MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) standard space coordinates (mm).   \nBetween-group comparison of activated and deactivated brain regions during task 1 in patients with essential tremor (ET) and healthy controls (HC). \n  \nVoxels, number of voxels in each significant cluster; MAX   Z-  statistic, value of the maximum   z-  statistic within the cluster; MAX X/Y/Z (mm), location of the maximum intensity voxel, given as spatial coordinate values in standard space (mm).

Both activations and deactivations could be observed in the HC group. In particular, in task 1 the outstretching of the right arm was associated with significant bilateral activations of the cerebellum (mainly homolaterally over lobules I\u2013VI, VIIIa, and Crus I), frontal and subcortical areas, such as caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus. Activations limited to the contralateral cortical motor areas were also found (pre/postcentral gyri), and a homolateral activation of the temporal areas and insula was detected (Figs.\u00a0  and S2, Table S2). Considering the deactivations associated with this task, a significant bilateral involvement of frontal and occipital areas plus cerebellum (mainly contralaterally over Crus I/II) could be detected in task 1 (Figs.\u00a0  and S2, Table S3).   \nActivation and deactivation maps. Fixed-effects group analysis results for task 1 (patients with essential tremor [ET] and healthy controls [HC]) and task 2 (HC only). Statistical maps are thresholded by using clusters determined by Z\u2009>\u20096 (activations) and Z\u2009<\u2009\u2212\u20096 (deactivations) with a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. \n  \n\nIn task 2, the voluntary oscillation of the right wrist induced significant and extensive bilateral activations of the cerebellum (lobules V\u2013VI and Crus I), cortical motor areas (pre/postcentral gyri, supplementary motor areas), and subcortical regions (thalamus and caudate nucleus). Predominantly contralateral activation of frontal areas, and homolateral activation of the insula were also detected in this condition (Figs.\u00a0  and S2, Table S2). When considering the deactivation, limited albeit significant deactivated clusters could be observed mainly over the contralateral frontal and posterior areas (as posterior cingulate gyrus) (Figs.\u00a0  and S2, Table S3). \n\n Patients  . In the ET group, postural tremor on extension of the right arm was mainly associated with extended bilateral activations of the frontal pole and caudate, contralateral activation of the pre/postcentral gyri, and with homolateral activation of frontal areas (precentral and middle frontal gyri), cerebellum (lobules V, VI, VIIIa, VIIIb, Crus I), temporal areas, and parietal opercular cortex (v, Table S2). In addition, a massive and unique cluster of deactivations was found, encompassing in particular the main motor areas, posterior areas and subcortical structures. Finally, an extended deactivation over the cerebellum was mainly detected in bilateral Crus I/II, left lobule VI, and left VIIb (Figs.\u00a0  and S2, Table S3, Figure  ). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis: between-group within-task comparison \n  \nWhen comparing the areas elicited by task 1 in the two groups, we found few clusters of significantly higher activation in ET patients compared to HC, mainly over the bilateral frontal pole and precentral gyrus. Conversely, widespread significantly stronger deactivations were observed, especially in the bilateral Crus I/II (with contralateral predominance), contralateral lobules V, VI and VIIb, pre/postcentral gyri, supplementary motor areas and subcortical structures (as caudate and thalamus) (Figs.\u00a0  and S3, Table  ).   \nStatistical comparisons for activations and deactivations. Brain areas statistically different across groups (patients with essential tremor [ET] and healthy controls [HC]) and tasks are illustrated in figure and color-coded by statistical significance. Activations and deactivations were compared separately in the statistical analyses, and significant clusters were determined by Z\u2009>\u20094 (activations) and Z\u2009<\u2009\u2212\u20094 (deactivations) with a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05.

Bottom: between-group between-task comparison (task 1 ET vs task 2 HC). \n  \n\nOn the other hand, HC showed few clusters of stronger activations in the homolateral cerebellum (mainly lobules I\u2013V), hippocampus, contralateral postcentral gyrus, supplementary motor areas, thalamus, and caudate nucleus as well as few voxels of significantly higher deactivation mainly in the contralateral frontal pole (Figs.\u00a0  and S3, Table  ). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis: between-group between-task comparison \n  \nThe between-group between-task comparison (task 1 in ET vs task 2 in HC) demonstrated few areas of significantly higher activations in patients compared to HC mimicking the tremor mainly over frontal and temporal areas bilaterally. Conversely, ET patients showed a large cluster of significantly higher deactivations spreading across the two cerebellar hemispheres (8734 voxels). In particular, as shown in Figs.\u00a0  and S4, this cerebellar cluster extends mainly over the bilateral Crus I and Crus II, and contralateral lobules I\u2013VI, VIIb, and IX. ET patients also showed a large cluster of significantly higher deactivation (~\u20096000 voxels) mainly encompassing contralateral pre/postcentral gyri, lateral occipital cortex, thalamus, caudate nucleus, and putamen. A subset of these regions in the homolateral cerebral hemisphere were also more strongly deactivated in ET patients, resulting in a cluster of 2014 voxels. \n\nThe simulated tremor in the HC group was mainly associated with a stronger activation of the motor circuit compared to patients, in particular over the bilateral cerebellum (lobule VI and Crus I), homolateral lobules I\u2013V, VIIb, VIIIa and Crus II, pre/postcentral gyri, and supplementary motor areas. Finally, few small clusters of significantly higher deactivations were found over the occipital areas for task 2 in HC compared to task 1 in ET (Fig.\u00a0 , Table  ). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis: within-group between-task results \n  \nFor the within-group between-task comparison in HC, activated voxels were significantly higher in the homolateral temporal areas, paracingulate gyrus, and in the contralateral frontal pole during extension of the right arm (task 1) compared with voluntary oscillation of the right wrist (task 2). In addition, we found significantly higher deactivations in contralateral postcentral gyrus, and lateral occipital cortex (Figures S5\u2013S6, Table S4). A single cluster of deactivation limited to the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere was also found for task 1\u2009>\u2009task 2 statistical comparison (134 voxels), encompassing lobules VIIb, VIIIa, and Crus I/II which are engaged in sensorimotor and cognitive processes. \n\nConversely, activations induced by task 2 were significantly higher than task 1 in several areas of the motor circuit, revealing extensive clusters over contralateral pre/postcentral gyri and supplementary motor areas. Bilateral, albeit predominantly homolateral, cerebellar changes were also present, mainly encompassing bilateral lobule VI and corresponding vermis, along with homolateral lobules V, VIIb, VIIIa, and Crus I. Contralateral lobule V and Crus I were also more strongly activated during task 2 compared to task 1. These cerebellar regions are involved in motor, sensorimotor, and cognitive processing. Significantly higher deactivations over the bilateral temporal pole and posterior/frontal areas were finally found (Figures S5\u2013S6, Table S4). \n\n\n### Task fMRI linear regression analysis with Fahn\u2013Tolosa\u2013Marin tremor rating scale (TRS) scores \n  \nDetailed results of the regression analyses are reported in Supplementary Table  . In particular, the clusters resulting from the voxelwise linear regression, subsequently masked with the BOLD (de)activations from the group analysis on ET patients, are indicated with their name, location of the maximum intensity voxel (X/Y/Z coordinates in MNI standard space), voxel size, correlation (r-value) and slope regression coefficient (beta value) together with their associated false-discovery-rate (FDR)-corrected   p  -values. The results for two representative regions (one activated and one deactivated as revealed by the group GLM analysis for task 1) are shown in Fig.\u00a0 , reporting the negative relationship between the BOLD   z  -statistic values and the TRS, part A\u2009+\u2009B.   \nLinear regression analysis. Regression results for two representative regions of interest are reported, one resulting as activated in the general linear model analysis for task 1 in patients with essential tremor (right pre/postcentral gyrus [PRG.r/POG.r]) and one as deactivated (left posterior cingulate gyrus [CGp.l]). Individual BOLD results, expressed as   z-  statistic values, were linearly regressed against the Fahn\u2013Tolosa\u2013Marin Tremor Rating Scale (TRS), part A\u2009+\u2009B. The correlation value (r-value) and the corresponding false-discovery rate (FDR)-corrected   p  -value (  p  ) are also reported. \n  \n\nA negative correlation between the TRS scores and BOLD values was found in all cases. Of note, only clusters with r-value\u2009<\u2009\u2212\u20090.8 are here reported (with   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 in all cases), while all the significant clusters are detailed in Table S5. A negative strong correlation with the TRS, part A was observed in a number of activated areas, including the right inferior/middle frontal gyri (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.923), anterior cingulate cortex (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.879), left pre/postcentral gyri (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.898), and in few deactivated areas, encompassing part of the left pre/postcentral gyri (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.891) and the right posterior cingulate gyrus/precentral gyrus (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.861). \n\nThe TRS, part A\u2009+\u2009B was negatively correlated with similar areas as before. For the activated areas, a negative linear relationship was found for several frontal areas (left and right anterior cingulate cortex/superior frontal gyrus/frontal pole with r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.918 and r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.859, respectively; right inferior/middle frontal gyri with r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.892) and motor areas (right and left pre/postcentral gyri with r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.905 and r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.803, respectively). For deactivation, a high correlation was found over the left posterior cingulate gyrus (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.923). \n\nFinally, a negative correlation existed between the TRS total score and a number of activated areas, including the right inferior/middle frontal gyrus/precentral gyrus (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.876) and the left central opercular cortex (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.840). A negative correlation with the TRS total score was also observed in some deactivated areas, including the left posterior cingulate gyrus (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.829). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study explored in-vivo morphological and functional brain modulations associated with ET in a homogeneous cohort of patients diagnosed according to the 2018 consensus criteria  by using VBM and task fMRI. VBM showed few clusters of focal GM atrophy in both cerebellar hemispheres with respect to HC, but these regions did not overlap with activated/deactivated brain areas on fMRI. In addition, ET patients displayed statistically different activation and deactivation mapping when tremor triggered by maintaining a posture with their right arm (task 1) was compared with both the same task and the simulation of tremor (task 2) in HC. As novel finding, ET patients revealed a widespread deactivation circuit associated with the postural component of their tremor, encompassing several motor areas (e.g., pre/postcentral gyri, supplementary motor areas and cerebellum) and subcortical structures (e.g., thalamus and putamen). Finally, a linear negative relationship between imaging (BOLD   z-  statistics) and clinical variables (TRS scores) was found over several areas, reaching high significances. \n\nFrom a morphological perspective, a significant GM volume loss (atrophy) was detected in posterior lobules of both cerebellar hemispheres in ET patients compared with HC, although not overlapping with the activated/deactivated cerebellar clusters shown in ET. These findings revealed the presence of a quite symmetric pattern of atrophy involving mainly, albeit not exclusively, cerebellar regions engaged in non-motor processing (sensorimotor, attention/executive functions, default-mode) . A much smaller cluster of significant GM atrophy was localized to the right occipital fusiform gyrus in the ET group. \n\nSeveral studies have hitherto investigated ET patients through VBM providing variable and inconsistent results . In some agreement with our findings, quite a few studies reported GM volume loss in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres either isolated or associated with GM density reduction in other brain regions, such as occipital lobes . Moreover, Bhalsing et al. detected GM volume reduction covering the anterior and posterior lobules of the cerebellum bilaterally in ET associated with cognitive impairment . On the other hand, several studies did not show any differences in GM cerebral and cerebellar volumes between ET patients and HC , whereas others reported increased GM volumes of the bilateral cerebellum  and right occipital fusiform gyrus  in ET patients. Discrepancies among studies might be attributable to patient selection reflecting, among others, less stringent diagnostic criteria for ET in the past, as well as to different MRI field strengths and heterogeneous anatomical sequences acquired in the populations . In order to minimize all these possible confounding factors and derive reliable information, in our age-matched case\u2013control study we enrolled a homogenous cohort of ET patients, relied on high-resolution volumetric anatomical images at 3\u00a0T and analyzed the data using state-of-the-art methods with a very stringent multiple comparison correction. All these elements allowed us to provide clear evidence in favor of a modulation of GM volume in specific areas of the cerebellum, as the analysis revealed nearly isolated clusters of cerebellar GM density reduction in our ET population which may be interpreted as regional atrophy in the context of a neurodegenerative disorder. Our VBM results might add some evidence to post-mortem findings of pathological changes in the cerebellar cortex, including reduction of Purkinje cell number, in several series of ET patients , thus supporting the pathophysiological hypothesis that ET is a neurodegenerative disorder centered in the cerebellum. \n\nFrom a functional perspective, main findings from our study are that: (1) postural tremor visible in ET patients with the right arm outstretched (task 1) was associated with significantly higher activation of bilateral frontal areas compared to task 1 and simulated tremor with the right arm outstretched (task 2) in HC; (2) ET patients during task 1 showed significantly higher deactivation of cerebellar regions engaged in both motor and non-motor processing, sensory-motor cortex, and basal ganglia bilaterally compared to task 1 in HC; (3) postural tremor in ET patients was associated with an increased deactivation of the cerebellum (again in lobules associated with motor and non-motor processes), sensory-motor cortex, lateral occipital cortex, thalamus, and caudate nucleus bilaterally compared to task 2 in HC. The consistency of these findings was supported by the use of highly conservative statistical thresholds with correction for multiple comparisons, aiming at uncovering only the most reliable possible activations/deactivations and significant differences. \n\nFew evidences on task fMRI in ET are available so far. Indeed, only seven studies have hitherto investigated ET using fMRI with a motor task and their findings are largely not comparable among each other neither to the results from this study due to inconsistencies in patient selection, differences in the acquisition scheme (mainly paradigms and tasks) and analysis methods . Our study appears partly comparable with only two previous fMRI studies sharing nearly identical motor tasks . Bucher et al. performed quite a pioneering study on a 1.5T MRI scanner and applied a different analysis approach, focusing on the temporal correlation between the time course of each voxel and the stimulus protocol rather than using GLM analyses, as widely done nowadays. In contrast to our findings, Bucher et al.  reported a significantly increased activation in the cerebellar hemispheres and ipsilateral red nucleus during tremor in ET patients compared to mimicked tremor in HC. No between-group differences were found in the activation of primary sensory-motor areas, globus pallidus, thalamus, and dentate nucleus. Likewise our study, Broersma et al.  used a block-related paradigm and similar tasks, although they added EMG recordings which were further used in their analyses to infer both block-related and tremor-related fMRI activations. Broersma et al.  detected block-related activations in the homolateral cerebellum, namely right lobule V, VI, and VIIIa, which further extend to right lobule VIIIb and the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere (left lobule V, VI, VIIb, and IX) when tremor-related analysis was performed. In our study, we found similar clusters of activations in the homolateral cerebellar hemisphere, although their extension was lower possibly due to the more restrictive statistical threshold we used in our analysis (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05 FWE-corrected vs   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 uncorrected). On the contrary, we mainly found deactivated regions in the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. \n\nIn the present study, concerning the activated areas in task 1, ET patients showed stronger activations over several frontal areas compared to HC performing the same task or simulating the tremor (task 2). Frontal areas are involved in planning motor action, movement initiation, maintenance, and planning of complex sequences. Moreover, neural activation patterns among these regions are involved in executive functioning and verbal working memory. Some preliminary studies demonstrated abnormally enhanced responses of prefrontal and parietal cortices in ET patients compared to HC while executing attentional and working memory tasks . This was also confirmed with rs-fMRI, revealing enhanced functional activity in specific resting state networks, such as the frontoparietal network, which correlated with increased disease severity, disease duration, and reduced cognitive ability . Likewise, our results demonstrate the presence of an increased activity in frontal and prefrontal regions in ET patients while performing a tremor-inducing motor task which might require an additional level of attention for them. In other terms, we speculate that ET patients need to exert greater control to maintain their right arm outstretched in a fixed position due to presence of postural tremor compared to HC. This is also in agreement with a recent study on Parkinson\u2019s disease and ET assessing the cortical activity patterns during bimanual tapping with EEG recordings . The authors found in the ET group an increased task related power in frontal areas involved in movement initiation and planning of complex sequences, confirming that ET patients require more attention, focus and control for correctly performing specific hand movements compared to HC. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, previous studies on task fMRI in ET have never reported BOLD signal decreases (deactivations), having focused only on activation patterns. This parallels the broader literature on task fMRI, which rarely reported on BOLD deactivations because of analysis methods which did not highlight them and/or difficult interpretations of their significance. Negative BOLD responses were previously shown to reflect task-related decrease in neural activity compared to the spontaneous activity level at rest . However, since statistical areas are obtained from the comparison between an active and a rest condition, it is difficult to determine whether decreased BOLD signals are pointing towards the deactivation of brain areas during the experimental task, as generally considered nowadays, or the activation of the same areas during the rest condition. Interpretations of BOLD deactivations are still controversial, and can be summarized into two main categories:   \nDeactivations might represent a direct hemodynamic consequence (\u2018blood stealing\u2019) occurring in response to flow changes in adjacent brain areas, since negative BOLD signals have previously been demonstrated to correspond to either local flow decreases  or transient redistribution of blood within a neural network ; \n  \nDeactivations could represent an inhibition process (i.e., an active suppression of neural activity in order to minimize the influence of other task-irrelevant neural processes) as revealed by several studies which show a relationship between negative BOLD signals and decreases in neural activity, therefore suggesting that this phenomenon is predominantly neuronal in origin and not driven by vascular steal . \n  \n\nDespite controversies, BOLD deactivations have gained increasing interest since their formalization by Raichle et al. almost twenty years ago . In this seminal paper, the authors proposed that the deactivation pattern may resemble a default state of the brain, involving areas whose activities are attenuated and/or suspended during specific and attention-demanding tasks. This peculiar deactivated map, called default-mode network (DMN), involves the posterior cingulate cortex, the medial frontal cortex and the angular gyrus region of the inferior parietal cortex, and has been replicated in numerous studies. However, further studies with cognitively demanding tasks proved that the deactivation patterns only marginally encompass the DMN, extending beyond this specific network on regions that are responsive to changes in task demand, such as the insula . Tasked-related deactivation is thus not limited to a fixed set of specialized regions and can occur in any brain region that is not apparently involved in controlling or processing the specific task . These findings are consistent with our observations which demonstrated for the first time in ET a widespread deactivated network associated with postural tremor, including areas of the DMN, sensory-motor network, cerebellum and deep structures as insula, amygdala and thalamus, further confirming the presence of a disrupted cerebello-thalamo-cortical tremor network. In addition, the widespread deactivation network observed in the present study might reflect\u00a0the spatial/temporal interaction between the DMN and other task-specific functional areas. When focusing on the cerebellum, a predominance of contralateral fMRI deactivations was found in ET patients. The interpretation of the present findings is controversial and remains purely speculative in view of the controversy on the significance of fMRI deactivations in previous literature and the lack of previous studies reporting fMRI deactivations in ET. The critical role of the cerebellum in the control of voluntary limb movements and movement-related sensory data acquisition has previously been established . In addition, great emphasis has been given to cerebellar dysfunction/pathology in ET . Overall, our findings on reduced cerebellar activations in ET patients compared to HC would support an ET-related impairment of cerebellar circuitry. In particular, during task 1, we found a significantly lower activation of the homolateral cerebellar hemisphere in ET compared to HC. We therefore speculate that the predominant contralateral deactivations in ET patients may represent an attempt of their underfunctioning homolateral hemisphere to gather its remaining capacity to fulfil its physiological role, i.e. controlling a task triggering tremor and therefore initiating acquisition of additional tremor-related sensory data. This is likely to represent a higher demanding sensorimotor processing compared to that required in HC. Following our speculation and considering the possible significance of negative BOLD responses, we might hypothesize that deactivations represent a direct hemodynamic consequence (\u2018blood stealing\u2019) or an active suppression of neural activity possibly occurring to prioritize/maximize task-relevant neural processes in the homolateral cerebellar hemisphere. \n\nOverall, deactivations can unveil relevant aspects of tremor generation and should be explored in future research on larger cohorts of patients with ET, as this study reveals some extent of overlap between deactivated areas and previous pathological findings showing neurodegeneration in the same areas . As additional proof of the altered functionality of these areas, some of them within the motor system showed altered connectivity patterns on previous rs-fMRI studies, which mainly revealed decreased connectivity within the cerebellum and an opposite trend over the pre/postcentral gyri, anterior cingulate and supplementary motor areas . \n\nFinally, the assessment of a possible linear relationship between tremor scales and BOLD (de)activations (expressed as   z-  statistic values) revealed significant negative correlations over several voxels and regions. When focusing on the activated areas resulting from the GLM analysis, ET patients with low tremor scores showed higher activations, whereas for increased tremor scores they showed a tendency to lower activation or even a shift to deactivation, with highly negative   z  -values for those patients with severe tremor. Conversely, when considering the deactivated areas, almost all patients revealed no activation and negative   z-  values which tended to become higher in absolute value as the tremor severity and body distribution increased. Therefore, the higher the severity and number of affected body segments the strongest the deactivation. These findings hold for all the three TRS subscores considered in the linear regression analysis, thus highlighting the different patterns of activations/deactivations at different level of tremor severity and body distribution and that more severe patients present a more disrupted tremor network. \n\nIn order to verify whether the mild inter-side difference in tremor severity might have determined differences in the intensity of fMRI modulations, we performed a correlation analysis between the intensity of fMRI (de)activations and the Fahn\u2013Tolosa\u2013Marin TRS, part A scores for both the right and left upper limb separately. In addition, we performed a correlation analysis between the intensity of fMRI (de)activations and the normalized tremor asymmetry index which was calculated as reported elsewhere . The first analysis confirms significantly negative correlations for both sides as found for the overall TRS-A score. In the second analysis, we did not find any significant correlation. These observations suggest that the mild inter-side difference in tremor severity is unlikely to have determined relevant differences in the intensity of fMRI (de)activations. The severity of tremor itself rather than its asymmetry appeared therefore related to fMRI modulations. \n\nWe acknowledge that this study has several limitations. First, the small sample size of the study cohort may have limited statistical power to identify less robust effects. However, compared to previous studies, we enrolled a highly homogeneous cohort of patients with ET diagnosed according to the 2018 strict consensus criteria. Second, our ET cohort has later onset and short disease duration than in previous studies of advanced neuroimaging in ET and this needs to be considered when comparing findings. However, our study seems to capture the later peak of the bimodal distribution of ET age of onset which is well established in previous literature . Third, we did not use an MRI-compatible electromyography to determine the frequency of simulated tremor in HC, although the performance of the movement was monitored by an operator throughout the entire acquisition. Finally, considering again the relatively small number of patients studied, the linear regression analyses need to be replicated using a larger sample to further confirm our findings of an inverse relationship between tremor scales and BOLD values, which however already reached a very high statistical significance. \n\nIn conclusion, application of combined VBM and task fMRI to a homogeneous cohort of patients with ET demonstrated the involvement of cerebellar areas and clear patterns of widespread deactivations in tasks triggering tremor, which encompassed both cortical and subcortical regions. Limited temporal resolution of BOLD-based fMRI prevents the identification of primary tremor generators or oscillatory mechanisms. However, taken together, our findings provide support for the key role of the cerebellum in the pathophysiology of ET and for the presence of a loop involved in tremor generation, encompassing known structures as cerebellar hemispheres, cortical motor areas, thalamus and pallidum. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTen ET patients (6 males, 69.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9\u00a0years) were consecutively enrolled at the Movement Disorders Centre of the University Hospital of Verona, Italy. ET was diagnosed according to the 2018 consensus criteria . Exclusion criteria were: presence of moderate to severe head tremor (score\u2009>\u20092 on the Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale) ; presence of rest tremor and/or other neurological signs; presence of cognitive impairment (Mini Mental State Examination  24); history of neurological or psychiatric diseases; current or past exposure to tremorgenic drugs; contraindication for MRI. In ET patients who were taking medications for tremor, drugs were stopped at least 72\u00a0h before the study session, which consisted of clinical assessment and MRI scanning performed on the same day. Ten age-matched healthy subjects (5 males, 67.7\u2009\u00b1\u20097.8\u00a0years) with no history of neurological or psychiatric diseases and unremarkable neurological assessment were recruited as controls. \n\nParticipants were asked to avoid caffeine, theine, and alcohol intake over 12\u00a0h preceding the study session. ET patients and HC gave their written informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the local Ethics Committee for Clinical Sperimentation (CESC) of Verona and Rovigo (no. 1482CESC) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2008). \n\n\n### Clinical assessment \n  \nAge of onset, disease duration, family history of ET or other neurological diseases, and effect of alcohol on tremor were collected. ET patients underwent a throughout neurological assessment by a movement disorder specialist and tremor was rated using the Fahn\u2013Tolosa\u2013Marin TRS . TRS includes three parts. Part A was used to assess tremor amplitude in different body sites (items 1\u20139, score: 0\u201384), part B to examine handwriting, drawing, and pouring (items 10\u201314, score: 0\u201336), and part C to evaluate the burden of tremor on activities of daily living (items 15\u201321, score: 0\u201328) . Assessment of depression and anxiety in both ET patients and HC was obtained by the self-administered questionnaires BDI-II (score: 0\u201363, higher score indicates more severe depression) and STAI Y2 for trait anxiety (score: 20\u201380, higher score indicates greater trait anxiety) . \n\nAs for demographic and clinical data, absolute and relative frequencies were tested by Fisher\u2019s Exact test. For continuous data, descriptive statistics are reported in terms of means and standard deviations and comparisons between groups were performed using non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney U test due to the small sample size (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05). All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS\u00ae Statistics (version 21.0). \n\n\n### Experimental protocol and image acquisition \n  \nET patients and HC underwent MRI scanning on a 3T system (Philips Achieva, Philips Medical Systems, Netherlands) equipped with an 8-channel head coil. They laid supine inside the bore of the scanner with their arms along the body and forearms pronated. The head was stabilized with adjustable padded restraints on both sides. Subjects were instructed to remain as still as possible and to keep their eyes closed throughout the experiment. \n\nIn ET patients, block-designed BOLD fMRI was performed during the execution of a motor task, i.e. maintaining the right arm outstretched leading to the appearance of tremor (task 1). Conversely, HC were scanned during two separate block-designed paradigms: (1) while maintaining the right arm outstretched, as in ET patients (task 1); (2) while mimicking a tremor through flexion\u2013extension of the right wrist at the highest frequency they could reach with the arm outstretched (task 2). As previously reported , the mimicked tremor task in controls should be considered as the optimal voluntary motor task for comparisons with the postural tremor in ET patients. Participants were externally cued to switch from rest (arms along the body) to active task and back to rest by the auditory inputs \u201cstart\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d presented via headphones and monitored in real-time by one evaluator. To ensure that tasks were performed as accurately as possible, all participants were trained for several minutes before undergoing MRI and monitored by an examiner throughout the whole acquisition. \n\nTask fMRI data were acquired using 2D gradient-echo echo-planar imaging and the following parameters: TR/TE\u2009=\u20092000/30\u00a0ms; 36 slices, 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20094 mm , no slice gap, FOV\u2009=\u2009192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192 mm ; flip angle\u2009=\u200975\u00b0. Each block-designed paradigm consisted of thirteen 20\u00a0s cycles of rest alternated with thirteen 20\u00a0s cycles of task, for a total of 260 volumes. A 3D T1-weighted turbo field echo scan was finally acquired for each subject (TR/TE\u2009=\u20098.16/3.73\u00a0ms; 180 slices, 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091 mm , no slice gap, FOV\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 mm ; flip angle\u2009=\u20098\u00b0). \n\n\n### VBM analysis \n  \nVBM analysis was performed using the optimised FSL-VBM protocol available in FSL 5.0.9 ( ) . T1-weighted images were brain-extracted (BET) and segmented into GM, WM and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using the FMRIB\u2019s Automated Segmentation Tool FAST. GM maps were affine-registered to the GM ICBM-152 template, concatenated and averaged across study subjects. This averaged image was flipped along the x-axis and the two mirror images re-averaged to obtain a first study-specific GM template. Individual GM images were subsequently non-linearly re-registered to this template, concatenated, averaged, and flipped along the x-axis. Both mirror images were finally averaged to create the symmetric, study-specific GM template (2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092mm , MNI space). Afterwards, each individual GM image was non-linearly registered to the study template, modulated to compensate for the contraction/enlargement due to the non-linear component of the transformation and smoothed (Gaussian kernel, sigma\u2009=\u20093\u00a0mm). A permutation-based non-parametric inference (5000 permutations) with the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) option was finally performed to statistically compare the GM images of the two groups. The significance level was set at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 and corrected for multiple comparisons (FWE). \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis and statistical comparisons \n  \nFunctional data were first minimally preprocessed using FSL 5.0.9. The pipeline included head motion correction (MCFLIRT), non-brain tissue removal (BET), spatial smoothing (isotropic Gaussian filter with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 6 mm ), and high-pass temporal filtering for removing slow drifts (0.01\u00a0Hz). Participant head motion profiles (three translations and three rotations) were statistically compared across conditions in order to test for possible differences in one or more motion parameters (non-parametric Wilcoxon tests,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05). Preprocessed data were registered to the T1-weighted image by applying a linear registration (FLIRT) with boundary-based registration (BBR) cost function . Each T1-weighted image was then registered to the 2-mm MNI standard space using a non-linear method (FNIRT). Finally, the joint BOLD/T1-weighted and T1-weighted/MNI transformation parameters were used to spatially normalize the functional data. \n\nTo identify activated/deactivated voxels at the single-subject level, a GLM analysis was performed . The stimulus-related regressor in the design matrix was assumed to be a vector describing the BOLD effect changes for the motor tasks. This was obtained by convolving the boxcar waveform, representing the experimental protocol, with a hemodynamic response function modelled by a canonical double-gamma function. Moreover, in order to account for movement-related artefacts and other non-neuronal fluctuations not completely eliminated by preprocessing, the six motion parameters from MCFLIRT were included as nuisance confounds in the design matrix, along with the average WM and CSF signals. These two regressors were calculated as the average of time courses within the corresponding tissue masks generated by segmenting the spatially normalized structural images (FAST) and thresholding the tissue probability maps at 0.9. Moreover, we took the probability of GM volume as further voxelwise covariate. \n\nFor each subject, a t-test was applied to create a   z  -statistic map for each dataset. These lower-level statistical maps were fed into the higher-level group analysis (FEAT). For task 1, a fixed-effects (FE) analysis was applied to estimate the group results in ET patients and HC, highlighting both the activated areas related to the task, and the deactivations. The high-level statistical maps were thresholded using clusters determined by Z\u2009>\u20096 (activations) and Z\u2009<\u2009\u2212\u20096 (deactivations) plus a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. A separate FE analysis was applied to the HC data for task 2 (same statistical threshold as for task 1). \n\nThree statistical analyses were finally performed to compare the identified brain areas: (1)   between-group analysis   (task 1 in ET patients vs HC); (2)   between-group between-task analysis   (task 1 in ET patients vs task 2 in HC); (3)   within-group analysis   (task 1 vs task 2 in HC). All these statistical maps were thresholded using clusters determined by Z\u2009>\u20094 (activations) and Z\u2009<\u2009\u2212\u20094 (deactivations) plus a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. \n\n\n### fMRI linear regression analysis with TRS \n  \nRegression analysis was carried out (fsl_glm) to voxelwise assess whether a linear relationship exists between TRS scores and BOLD (de)activations in ET patients. In particular, part A, A\u2009+\u2009B and A\u2009+\u2009B\u2009+\u2009C (total) of the TRS were separately considered as clinical variables in a linear regression. For fMRI, individual   z-  statistic maps resulting from lower-level single-subject analysis were used as representative values of BOLD (de)activations. For each analysis, resulting   p  -values were corrected for multiple comparisons (FDR) and only corrected   p  -values\u2009<\u20090.05 were considered as statistically significant. These statistical maps were finally masked using (de)activation clusters resulting from the patient group analysis, in order to restrict the assessment of the clinical/imaging link to the areas elicited by task 1. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tET (n\u2009=\u200910)\tHC (n\u2009=\u200910)\tp valuea\nDemographic characteristics\tDemographic characteristics\tDemographic characteristics\tDemographic characteristics\nAge (years)\t69.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9\t67.7\u2009\u00b1\u20097.8\t0.579\nGender (M:F)\t6:4\t5:5\t1.000\nHandedness for writing (R:L)\t10:0\t10:0\t1.000\nCharacteristics of ET\tCharacteristics of ET\tCharacteristics of ET\tCharacteristics of ET\nAge of onset (years)\t61.9\u2009\u00b1\u200911.6\t\t\nDisease duration (years)\t7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4\t\t\nBody distribution\tBody distribution\tBody distribution\tBody distribution\nUpper limb\t10\t\t\nHead\t2\t\t\nVoice\t4\t\t\nLower limb\t3\t\t\nFamily history of ET\t7\t\t\nResponse to alcohol\t+\u2009(2); \u2212 (4); CAN (4)\t\t\nFahn\u2013Tolosa\u2013Marin TRS\tFahn\u2013Tolosa\u2013Marin TRS\tFahn\u2013Tolosa\u2013Marin TRS\tFahn\u2013Tolosa\u2013Marin TRS\nTRS-A\t6.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6\t\t\nTRS-B\t11.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.6\t\t\nTRS-C\t5.1\u2009\u00b1\u20095.5\t\t\nTRS total\t23.9\u2009\u00b1\u20098.4\t\t\nPsychological assessment\tPsychological assessment\tPsychological assessment\tPsychological assessment\nBDI-II\t10.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.9\t7.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3\t0.280\nSTAI Y2\t39.3\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9\t36.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1\t0.631\n### Caption\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with essential tremor (ET) and healthy controls (HC).\n### Footer\nResults are provided as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviations and absolute frequencies.BDI-II, beck depression inventory II (score: 0\u201363; higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms); CAN, cannot answer; ET, patients with essential tremor; F, female; HC, healthy controls; L, left; M, male; n, units; NA, not applicable; R, right; STAI Y2, state-trait anxiety inventory form Y2 (score 20\u201380; higher scores indicate more severe trait anxiety); TRS, tremor rating scale (subscore A: 0\u201380, subscore B: 0\u201336, subscore C: 0\u201328, total score: 0\u2013144; higher scores indicate more severe tremor; TRS scores were assessed while patients were off medication).aMann\u2013Whitney U and Fisher\u2019s Exact tests.\n\n\n## ID: Tab2\n### Label: Table 2\nROI\tVoxels\tMAX Z-statistic\tMAX X (mm)\tMAX Y (mm)\tMAX Z (mm)\nACTIVATIONS\tACTIVATIONS\tACTIVATIONS\tACTIVATIONS\tACTIVATIONS\tACTIVATIONS\nTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009>\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009>\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009>\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009>\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009>\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009>\u2009HC\nFP.l\t717\t8.26\t66\t84\t39\nPRG.r/MFG.r\t326\t7.75\t19\t66\t48\nFP.r\t261\t9\t32\t88\t31\nCaud.r\t111\t6.19\t36\t75\t34\nPRG.l\t101\t8.47\t61\t58\t60\nTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009<\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009<\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009<\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009<\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009<\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009<\u2009HC\nCER.r\t484\t7.52\t42\t40\t32\nHIPP.r\t201\t7.17\t31\t59\t26\nPOG.l\t105\t7.4\t61\t45\t64\nTHL.l/Caud.l\t104\t5.45\t51\t56\t45\nSMA\t101\t6.16\t48\t51\t61\nDEACTIVATIONS\tDEACTIVATIONS\tDEACTIVATIONS\tDEACTIVATIONS\tDEACTIVATIONS\tDEACTIVATIONS\nTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009>\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009>\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009>\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009>\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009>\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009>\u2009HC\nCER.l\t8593\t\u2212\u200915.4\t48\t19\t18\nPRG.r/POG.r/LOC.r\t3776\t\u2212\u20099.73\t28\t39\t55\nPRG.l/POG.l/LOC.l/SMA\t3279\t\u2212\u200910.3\t67\t32\t51\nCER.r\t1588\t\u2212\u200911.4\t35\t18\t17\nPAC\t342\t\u2212\u20096.84\t48\t75\t59\nCGp.l\t281\t\u2212\u20098.66\t47\t41\t45\nFP.r\t252\t\u2212\u20096.73\t25\t88\t49\nAMY.r\t178\t\u2212\u20097.36\t32\t60\t28\nTHL.r/Caud.r/THL.l/Caud.l\t122\t\u2212\u20096.4\t36\t53\t42\nTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009<\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009<\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009<\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009<\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009<\u2009HC\tTASK 1\u2014ET\u2009<\u2009HC\nFP.l\t100\t\u2212\u20097.9\t61\t83\t52\n### Caption\nBetween-group comparison of activated and deactivated brain regions during task 1 in patients with essential tremor (ET) and healthy controls (HC).\n### Footer\nVoxels, number of voxels in each significant cluster; MAX Z-statistic, value of the maximum z-statistic within the cluster; MAX X/Y/Z (mm), location of the maximum intensity voxel, given as spatial coordinate values in standard space (mm).

Psychogenic erectile dysfunction (pED) consists of a major part of male sexual dysfunction in China, but the understanding of the central mechanism of pED is still in its infancy. It is commonly appreciated that pED is a functional disorder, which can be attributed predominantly or exclusively to psychological factors, such as anxiety, depression, loss of self-esteem, and psychosocial stresses. Most previous studies probed the central response in the brain of pED patients using sexual-related stimuli. However, little concern has been given to a more fundamental issue whether the baseline brain activity is altered in pED or not. With rs-fMRI data, the current study aimed to explain the central mechanism behind pED by investigating the alterations in baseline brain activity in patients with pED, as indexed by the amplitude of low-frequency (0.01\u20130.08\u00a0Hz) fluctuation (ALFF). After the psychological screening and urological examination procedure, 26 pED patients and 26 healthy matched controls were enrolled. Our results explicated significantly lower baseline brain activity in the right anterior insula and right orbitofrontal cortex for pED patients (multiple comparison corrected). Additionally, the voxel-wise correlation analysis showed that ALFF of the right anterior insula was correlated with the outcomes of erectile function (multiple comparison corrected). Our results implied there was impaired cognitive and motivational processing of sexual stimuli in pED patients. Our current findings may shed light on the neural pathology underlying pED. We hope that our study has provided a new angle looking into pED research by investigating resting state brain activity. Furthermore, we suggest that the current study may put forward a more subtle conception of insular influence on pED, which may help foster new specific, mechanistic insights. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPsychogenic erectile dysfunction (pED) is defined as the persistent inability to achieve or maintain an erection adequate for copulatory behavior owing predominantly or exclusively to psychological or interpersonal factors, such as anxiety, depression, loss of self-esteem, and other psychosocial stresses (Wylie and MacInnes  ). In China, epidemiology studies have shown that pED suffers consist of up to 90% of patients suffering from erectile dysfunction under their 40\u00a0s (Tan et al.  ). Despite its high prevalence, the understanding of the central mechanism of pED is still in its infancy. Moreover, there is no effective treatment to pED yet due to the ambiguity in its underlying neural mechanism. \n\npED is independent of other vasculogenic or organic, neurologic, and endocrinologic mechanisms (Janssen  ) and therefore is suggested to be a functional disorder, which can be attributed to abnormal central factors (Wylie and MacInnes  ; Hatzimouratidis et al.  ). Recently, neuroimaging studies have endeavored to disclose the neural mechanism underlying pED (Hagemann et al.  ; Montorsi et al.  ; Cera et al.   and,  ) and explicated spread brain areas, indicating the plausible role of high order factors in pED. Findings from our group (Zhang et al.  ; Zhao et al.  ,  ) and other groups (Cera et al.  ) disclosed structural brain alterations in pED patients, such as the insula cortex, the orbital frontal cortex, the hypothalamus, the medial prefrontal, the cingulate cortex, and the inferotemporal cortex, which are also engaged in emotional and cognitive processing of sexual stimuli (Mouras, Stol\u00e9ru et al.  ; Redout\u00e9 et al.  ). In the absence of overt perceptual input and behavioral output, a restful brain consists of spontaneous fluctuations in neuronal activity (Zhang and Raichle  ), as reflected in spontaneous activity of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The resting state brain activity plays a pivotal role in maintaining the ongoing, internal representations (Lewis et al.  ), which may be involved in the coding of expected sensory stimuli and prior experience (Miall and Robertson  ). In other words, the resting brain is the collection of previous experience (Dong et al.   and,  ). Both typical and atypical sexual experiences modify human brain function, which in return influences subsequent sexual behavior (Georgiadis et al.  ). Specifically, a previous conclusion demonstrated that pED is likely to derive from unsuccessful sexual experience caused by religious beliefs, interpersonal relationships, psychological well-being, and other factors (Wylie and MacInnes  ). Also, rs-fMRI is used in previous studies in probing the central mechanism of a wide range of disorders (Barkhof et al.  ; Satterthwaite and Baker  ). Therefore, we suggest that resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) may be capable of elucidating the underlying neural mechanism of pED (Hamaide et al.  ). \n\nThe structural and task-based functional alterations in the brain of pED patients leads to an important question whether or not the baseline brain activity is altered in pED patients. We suggest that it be fundamental in that the changes in baseline brain activity may smear the spatial activation under task (Di et al.  ), which may bring bias into previous conclusions. The amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) is a reliable and reproducible method to measure baseline brain activity in both healthy participants (Yang et al.  ; Zuo et al.  ) and patients (Qi et al.  ). Several studies employed it to measure the alterations in baseline brain activity for both healthy subjects (Zuo et al.  ; Dong et al.  ) and subjects with pathological conditions (Liu et al.  ). Therefore, in the current study, we used ALFF as the metrics of baseline brain activity to determine whether or not the baseline brain activity was altered in pED patients. Given that empirical data and previous studies on pED reported no impairment in low-order processing (Cera et al.  ,  ; Zhao et al.  ,  ), i.e. sensory and autonomic processing of the sexual stimulus, we expected to see baseline brain activity alterations in regions contributing to high-order mediation of erection, such as emotional, cognitive or motivational aspects (Stol\u00e9ru et al.  ). Furthermore, we conducted a voxel-wise correlation analysis to investigate whether or not such alterations were related to their behavioral measurements. We suggest that our current findings may shed light on the neural pathology underlying pED and would help foster new specific, mechanistic insights. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the ethics committee of Henan Provincial People\u2019s Hospital. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Henan Provincial People\u2019s Hospital. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The detailed study design was explained to all subjects and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. \n\n### Subjects \n  \nThe subjects of the ED group were in-patients from the Department of Urology, Henan Provincial People\u2019s Hospital. The subjects of the normal control group (NC) were recruited by advertisement. Sixty-four right-handed male heterosexual pED patients and fourty-one right-handed male heterosexual normal controls (NC) were recruited. After rigorous subject inclusion procedures (interview, physical examination and questionnaire evaluation), the remaining 52 subjects (26 pED subjects, 26.8\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0\u00a0years mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD v.s. 26 NC subjects 28.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2years, mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) were recruited for the MRI scanning. All subjects were sexually experienced (Forbes et al.  ). \n\nIn the initial interview session, the basic information (history of sexual relations, history of ED, demographic information, sexual experience, medical and medication history, surgical disorders, etc.) was collected by a doctor from the Department of Urology and confirmed by another doctor from the Department of Radiology respectively. Specifically, the medication history of subjects was carefully reviewed and recorded. Only subjects with a clear medication history remained in the subsequent procedure. Given that pED patients were in-patients with a history of ED for more than 6 months, it was especially difficult to recruit drug-na\u00efve subjects. Therefore, we focused on patients whose medication history contained drugs with defined pharmacokinetic function, so that the MRI scanning could be conducted outside the washout period. According to records, patients included in this study took tadalafil, sildenafil, vardenafil and apomorphine. These drugs were easy to metabolize and caused no permanent effects on the subjects\u2019 central nervous system (Altwein and Keuler  ; Porst et al.  ; Gaines  ; Forgue et al.  ). Subjects were asked to avoid taking these medicines one week ahead of MRI data acquisition to ensure they were free of the drug\u2019s impact. \n\nThe exclusion criteria for both groups were: (1) use of any psychoactive medication and other medications that might affect sexual function; (2) history of using recreational drugs; (3) use of medication designed to enhance sexual performance; (4) history of committing any sexual offence; and (5) lacking experience of sexual intercourse. For the pED group, additional exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) history of ED less than six months. For the NC group, additional exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) history of ED. \n\nThe diagnosis of pED (generalized type) was performed according to current guidelines (Hatzimouratidis et al.  ): absence of vasculogenic, neurogenic, hormonal, anatomical, and drug-induced ED. After an in-depth face-to-face interview, behavioral/physical assessments were carried out to exclude pED patients with vasculogenic or organic, neurologic, and endocrinologic factors. Normal morning erections, normal penile hemodynamics according to color Doppler sonography, and normal nocturnal erections were evaluated by the RigiScan device during three consecutive nights. These assessments were also conducted in the NC group, revealing no differences for both groups. Also, participants did not show any hormonal and metabolic disease. \n\n\n### Behavioral/psychological measurement \n  \nParticipants in this study also completed several questionnaires. The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) (Rosen et al.  ) was used to assess erectile functioning for all participants. It is a 19-item questionnaire that requires men to provide Likert-scaled ratings of their experience with erectile function, intercourse satisfaction, orgasmic function, overall satisfaction, and sexual desire. The scales converge with clinical interviews, have high test\u2013retest reliability, and do not co-vary with measures of social desirability (Rosen et al.  ). It is a clinical and diagnostic evaluation of ED severity. IIEF is not a useful tool for differentiating vascular causes of erectile problems (Kassouf and Carrier  ), but it has been used in thousands of studies to quantify clinical improvement (Martin-Morales et al.  ) and general erectile functioning (Janssen et al.  ). Furthermore, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) (Jegede  ) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) (Zung  ) were used to evaluate the anxiety and depression levels for all participants involved. \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in this study were obtained on a 3T GE 750 Discovery MRI scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, USA), with a dedicated 8-channel head coil. Resting-state functional images were collected using an echo-planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: scan duration\u2009=\u20098\u00a0min, repetition time\u2009=\u20092000\u00a0ms, echo time\u2009=\u200930\u00a0ms, field of view\u2009=\u200924, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, number of slices\u2009=\u2009240, slice thickness\u2009=\u20094\u00a0mm, gap\u2009=\u20090\u00a0mm, and matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964. During the whole scanning process, the subjects were asked to keep their eyes closed, their head still and stay awake. After the scanning session, the subjects were asked whether they had fallen asleep during the scanning. \n\n\n### Functional data preprocessing \n  \nData preprocessing procedures were carried out using the DPABI toolbox v2.0 ( ) and SPM 8 ( ) under Matlab2009a. \n\n#### Resting data processing \n  \nFor each subject, the first 10 volumes were discarded to eliminate non-equilibrium effects of magnetization and allow the participants to adapt to the EPI scanning environment. The images were corrected for the acquisition delay between slices, motion corrected by regressing out the six rigid body parameters, and co-registered to the subject\u2019s anatomical images in native space. No subjects had head motions exceeding 1.5\u00a0mm of movement or 1.5\u00b0of rotation in any direction. The nuisances (head motion, white matter and cerebro-spinal fluid signals) were regressed out. Next, all functional images were normalized to MRI space using the deformation field maps obtained from structural image segmentation following the segmentation routine in SPM8. The normalized images were resampled to 3\u00a0mm isotropic voxels, which were then spatially smoothed with a 6\u00a0mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. Finally, linear trend was removed and temporal filtering (0.01\u20130.08\u00a0Hz (Biswal et al.  )) was performed on the time series of each voxel to reduce the effect of low-frequency drifts and high-frequency noise. \n\n\n#### ALFF map \n  \nThe ALFF analysis was carried out using the REST package ( ), which has been described in previous studies (Yang et al.  ). Briefly, the filtered time series was transformed to the frequency domain using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Since the power of a given frequency was proportional to the square of the amplitude of this frequency component, the square root was calculated at each frequency of the power spectrum and the averaged square root was obtained across 0.01\u20130.08\u00a0Hz at each voxel. This averaged square root was taken as the ALFF. For standardization, the ALFF of each voxel was divided by the global mean ALFF value for each subject, resulting in a relative ALFF, the standardized ALFF of each voxel then had a value of about 1, as done in PET studies (Raichle, MacLeod et al. 2001). \n\n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \n#### Between-group ALFF analysis \n  \nFor the between group analysis, a two-sample   t  -test was performed to detect the ALFF difference between the two groups. The results were considered significant above a threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009  0.05 (family-wise error, FWE corrected)  . \n\n\n#### Correlation analysis \n  \nTo examine the relationship between the behavioral/psychological measurement and the brain measurement, voxel-wise correlation analysis was performed between the duration of pED, scores of IIEF, SAS, SDS and ALFF outcomes. The results were considered significant above a threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009  0.05 (family-wise error, FWE corrected)  . \n\n\n#### Post hoc analysis \n  \nIn the present samples, SAS and SDS scores showed significant differences between the two groups. Therefore, we repeated the between-group comparison in the FC analysis after controlling SAS and SDS scores to ensure that these variables were not driving our results. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Results of demographic and psychological/behavioral data analysis \n  \nAs shown in Table\u00a0 , pED and NC groups were not significantly different from the NC group in terms of age and level of education (  p  \u2009>\u2009  0.05, two-sample t-test, two-tailed  ). pED patients had lower IIEF scores (  p  \u2009<\u2009  0.05, two-sample t-test, two-tailed  ), indicating impaired erectile function. As expected, the pED group also had higher SAS (  p  \u2009<\u2009  0.05, two-sample t-test, two-tailed  ) and SDS scores (  p  \u2009<\u2009  0.05, two-sample t-test, two-tailed  ) than NC. These findings are not surprising in that established clinical evidence reported high prevalence of negative psychological effects, such as anxiety, depression and embarrassment, in men with impaired sexual function (Janssen  ; Hatzimouratidis et al.  ). \n\n  \nDemographics and behavioral measurements in the pED group and the healthy control group \n  \npED: Psychogenic erectile dysfunction; NC: Normal controls; SD: Standard deviation; IIEF:\u2009International Index of Erectile Function; SAS: Self-rating anxiety scale; SDS: Self-rating depression scale \n\nDenotes significant difference between groups (  p  \u2009<\u2009  0.05  ) \n  \n\n\n### Results of between-group ALFF results \n  \nCompared with NC, the results of the two-sample   t  -test demonstrated a significantly lower ALFF value (  p  \u2009<\u2009  0.05, voxel level, FWE corrected, pED v.s. NC  ) in the right anterior insular cortex (AI) and the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in pED patients, indicating a significantly lower baseline brain activity in the pED group. The localization of the anterior insular cortex was based on the method and templates proposed in a previous publication (Kelly et al.  ). No brain regions with a significant ALFF increment were found in the pED group. \n\n\n### Results of the correlation analysis \n  \nNo significant correlations or negative correlations were identified at the threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009  0.05 (FWE corrected)  . Therefore, a secondary but rigorous threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009  0.01 (AlphaSim corrected)   was adopted. Voxel wise correlation analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between baseline brain activity in the right AI, as indexed by ALFF, and erectile functioning, as indexed by IIEF scores (  Alphasim correction, p  \u2009<\u20090.01\u00a0at cluster level, the corresponding statistical level is set at |Z | >3.33 (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001\u00a0at voxel level, 5000 times of the Monte Carlo simulations using the AFNI AlphaSim program) and cluster size\u2009>\u2009124 voxels (  search volume  \u2009=\u2009  70,831 voxels  )), which corresponds to a corrected   p  \u2009<\u2009  0.01  \u00a0at cluster level (Fig.\u00a0 a). Its peak voxel (34, 14, 4; Z\u2009=\u20096.0) was located within the right AI. We displayed a scatter plot between IIEF ratings and the peak ALFF voxel from the correlation map (  r  \u2009=\u20090.72,   p  \u2009=\u20091.76\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ) for the purpose of illustration, otherwise it would be a circular analysis (Fig.\u00a0 b). No such correlations or negative correlations were found between outcomes of other behavioral tests (SAS, SDS) and ALFF, as well as between the duration of pED and ALFF for the pED group exceeding the same level of significance. \n\n\n### Results of post hoc analysis \n  \nThe results were not changed after controlling SAS scores and SDS scores, indicating that the outcomes reported in the current study were not driven by SAS/SDS differences. Established clinical evidence reported high prevalence of negative psychological effects, such as anxiety, depression and embarrassment, in men with impaired sexual function (Janssen   and; Hatzimouratidis et al.  ), suggesting that these factors are inseparable from the pED study. Therefore, we proposed that slight anxiety/depression should be taken as the net effect of pED. Accordingly, please note that the major findings of the current study were outcomes without controlling SAS and SDS as covariates. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nPsychogenic erectile dysfunction (pED) is a functional disorder (Wylie and MacInnes  ) and previous fMRI studies investigating the central mechanism of pED used visual sexual stimuli (Cera et al.   and,  ). The current study focused on resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and investigated a fundamental issue in pED studies whether or not the baseline level brain activity, as indexed by ALFF, was altered in pED. Specifically, for the behavioral data, pED showed impaired erectile function compared with NA, as depicted by lower IIEF scores (Fig.\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0 ). For the MRI data, significantly lower ALFF was identified in the right anterior insula (AI) and the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in the pED group. The level of erectile function was correlated with baseline brain activity in the right AI using a voxel-wise correlation analysis (Fig.\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0 ). We suggest that our current study may shed new light on the neural mechanism of pED. \n\n  \nResults of ALFF differences between the pED group (  n   = 26) and healthy control group (  n   = 26) (  p   < 0.05,   FWE   corrected, voxel level, displayed in axial view,   pED v.s. NC  ). Error bars:   SEM  . (  a  ) A significantly lower baseline brain activity of the right AI and OFC in pED patients was observed as compared with normal controls.

Error bars:   SEM  . (  a  ) Significant correlation was identified in the right anterior insula shown between ALFF and IIEF in all subjects (n = 52,   p   < 0.01, Alphasim corrected). The statistical threshold was set at |Z| > 3.33 (  p   < 0.001 at the voxel level) and cluster size > 124 voxels, which correspond to a corrected   p   < 0.01 at the cluster level. (  b  ) The scatter plot map computed as ALFF of the peak voxel (34, 14, 4) in the correlation analysis and IIEF scores. Please note that this map is only for illustration purposes, otherwise there would be the risk of a circular analysis \n  \n\n  \nSignificant group ALFF differences (  p  <0.05) between the pED group (n\u2009=\u200926) and the healthy control group (n\u2009=\u200926) \n  \nAI: anterior insula; OFC: orbitofrontal cortex; R : right ; BA : brodmann area; \n  \n\n  \nSignificant voxel-wise correlation between ALFF and all the subjects (n\u2009=\u200952) (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01, Alphasim corrected) \n  \nAI: anterior insula; R : right ; BA : brodmann area; \n  \n\n### Resting state fMRI and pED \n  \nThe current study uniquely focused on the resting state brain activity rather than brain responses under stimulation of sexual stimuli. We argue that rs-fMRI is of great importance to pED studies. \n\nFirstly, we suggest that baseline issue is rudimentary in fMRI studies, particularly for studies using task paradigms, in that (1) Changes in baseline brain activity may smear the spatial activation under task (Di et al.  ); (2) Baseline alterations may bring biased results into the fMRI study (Lee et al.   and; Dong et al.  ). This issue is more urgent given that a major part of existing MRI literature on pED central mechanism used tasks paradigms (Cera et al.   and,  ). Therefore, we started from this fundamental issue and investigated the baseline brain activity changes using rs-fMRI. Secondly, to a fair extent, sexuality is a learned process (Georgiadis et al.  ). Even the quality of sexual activity (Pfaus et al.  ) contributes to sexual learning (Georgiadis et al.  ). And, the learning process shapes or modifies human brain function with respect to components of sexual activity, which in return influencing subsequent sexual behavior both typically and atypically(Georgiadis  ). In other words, all mismatched failure experiences are associative with learning process and written into the brain, which may explain how sexual difficulties or even dysfunctions develop (Both et al.  ; Hoffmann et al.  ; Woodson  ). Clinical observations suggested that the erectile dysfunction may develop from unsuccessful experience (Rosen  ). Resting state actively processes prior experience (Miall and Robertson  ), which may facilitated in the coding learned experience (Peigneux et al.  ). Therefore, resting state data may conceive important information regarding the central mechanism of pED. Last but not least, sexual responses are induced by both external stimuli, encompassing all sensory modalities, such as visual input (Stoleru et al.  ; Redout\u00e9 et al.  ; Bocher et al.  ; Arnow et al.  ; Karama et al.  ; Hagemann et al.  ), tactile input (Holstege et al.  ; Georgiadis et al.  ), auditory input (Georgiadis et al.  ) and olfactory input (Huh et al.  ; Pfaus et al.  ), and even internal stimuli which is independent of any sexual bodily stimulation, i.e., sheer mental force (e.g. imagery) (Smith and Over  ; Whipple et al.  ; Beauregard et al.  ). Empirical data and previous studies on pED report no impairment in the low order processing of sexual stimulus(Cera et al.  ,  ; Zhao et al.  ,  ), i.e. sensory and autonomic information, thus suggesting that the high order processing of sexual stimulus, i.e. cognitive, emotional, anamnestic and motivational aspects, may be problematic. These processes are independent of sensory input modality, therefore, the rs-fMRI, which is absent of sensory stimulation, could enable us to focus on the core process of sexual stimuli processing. \n\n\n### The baseline alteration in the right anterior insula (AI) \n  \nThe current study reported baseline disruption in the right AI, whose level of baseline brain activity was also correlated with erectile dysfunction scores (Fig.\u00a0 a, b; Table\u00a0 ). The insula is hard-wired in a sexual cycle, especially in the mediation of erection. Supportive evidence came from animal studies using rodents, given the homology between the human and rodent insula in terms of corresponding cytoarchitecture and connectivity (Namkung et al.  ). Particularly, the insula is activated by copulation with a preferred scented partner (Pfaus and Heeb  ) and mediation of erectile function in male rats (Georgiadis  ; Georgiadis et al.  ). In neuroimaging studies involving healthy males, the activation of the insula has been consistently reported (Stoleru et al.  ; Stoleru  ; Sescousse et al.  ) especially its direct role in mediation of penile erection, such as perceptual processing of penile inputs (Moulier et al.  ), onset of erection (Miyagawa et al.  ), recognition of erection (Arnow et al.  ) and sustained penile response to erotic stimuli (Ferretti et al.  ). In contrast, the malfunction of the insula was reported in subjects with male sexual dysfunction (Stol\u00e9ru et al.  ; Gratzke et al.  ), particularly in pED studies (Cera et al.  ,  ; Zhao et al.  ,  ). Moreover, in the current study, the erection scores of subjects were correlated with baseline activity of the right AI, confirming its important role in the mediation of erection. \n\nIndeed, erection is the anchor of male sexual activity. It is the production of highly dynamic interplay of central/supraspinal signaling and periphery information (Giuliano and Rampin  ; Andersson  ). The process engages complicated components, such as perceptual, cognitive, motivational, emotional, inhibitory and autonomic components, encompassing a network of brain areas (Georgiadis et al.  ; Poeppl et al.  ; Zhao et al.  ,  ). Erection is invariably associated with physiological states, most importantly the change in genitals, which gives rise to strong interoceptive signals (Andersson  ). Basically, interoceptive signals arrive in the posterior insula where low-level sensory features are processed (Namkung et al.  ). Then, AI integrates the re-represented interoceptive signals passed on from the posterior insula with emotional, cognitive, and motivational signals collected from other cortical and subcortical regions (Gasquoine  ; Droutman et al.  ). Aberrant baseline brain activity in the right AI may indicate functional abnormality or deterioration in this area, although its exact biological basis is to be determined. Given that AI has a central role in supporting subjective feeling states, as well as regulating the introduction of insula-mediated feelings into cognitive and motivational processes in behaviorally relevant contexts (Gasquoine  ), three main interpretations regarding insular involvement in pED can be proposed. Firstly, dysfunction of the AI is mirrored in abnormal subjective feelings (Craig  ) leading to biased encoding in sexual context. Rewarding sexual stimuli normally evoke feeling of pleasure, but, in pED, it is quite likely that sexual stimuli are represented as aversive feelings, eventually leading to failure of engagement in copulatory behaviors. Secondly, AI plays an important role in cognition (Namkung et al.  ): sexual stimulation is highly salient and AI initiates cognitive processes for processing salient information by marking salient information, i.e. sexual stimuli. Therefore, dysfunction of AI may prioritize cognitive resources for other extractions other than sexual stimuli, eventually leading to inability of maintaining erection. Thirdly, AI plays an important role in motivation (Naqvi and Bechara  ), i.e. subject desire to engage in behaviors. Converging evidence suggests that the insula encodes incentive values of stimuli by evaluating the stimuli-eliciting subjective feeling states (Balleine and Dickinson  ; Naqvi and Bechara  ). Dysfunction in the AI may disrupt the encoding of sexual stimuli. In other words, sexual stimuli, which are rewarding, evoke feelings of pleasure and in turn drive conscious desires for deciding to take particular actions, may be regarded as aversive stimuli in pED and thus lead to conscious aversions for avoiding engagement in sexual behaviors. Indeed, our interpretation of this finding can hardly be conclusive until our follow-up studies are better tailored to such specific interpretations delivering more satisfactory answers. \n\n\n### The baseline alteration in the right OFC \n  \nThe current study reported decreased baseline activity in the right OFC (Fig.\u00a0 a, c; Table\u00a0 ). A number of lesion, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging studies indicated a general role for the OFC in encoding the value assigned to different goods, including sexual rewards, pleasant touch, pleasant odors, or visual presentation of food in both human (Plassmann et al.  ; Chib et al.  ; FitzGerald et al.  ; Sescousse et al.  ) and nonhuman primates (Padoa-Schioppa and Assad  ). In the case of sexual stimuli, the right OFC is identified as the neural correlate of the process of appraisal through which stimuli are categorized as sexual incentives and quantitatively evaluated as such (Redout\u00e9 et al.  ), and thus eventually assigning motivational significance to sensory inputs(Stol\u00e9ru et al.  ). We suggest that the observed lower baseline brain activity in the pED group may indicate impaired processing of cognitive/motivation processes of sexual incentives(Namkung et al.  ), which would jeopardize male sexual arousal. Given the reciprocal connections between the OFC and AI (Droutman et al.  ), the dysfunction in the right AI and OFC may act upon each other, giving rise to incorrect interpretation of sexual incentive. This may cause a long-term deficit in sexual reward, which is a major factor for sexual learning. Eventually, atypical sexual learning may be closely related to pED. \n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nWe suggest that several limitations should be taken into consideration when interpreting the current findings. Firstly, the sample sizes were relatively small after the rigorous subject exclusion process. Although the results survived a strict statistical threshold, we still suggest that the findings should bear replication in other studies using larger samples. Actually, one major aim of our currently undergoing study is to verify the reliability of our findings. Secondly, an individual\u2019s sexual response is the net outcome of many factors. These include factors that have already been controlled in the current study and those beyond our research, such as genetic or innate (e.g., gender) factors, or factors related to transient changes of the internal state induced by stress, metabolic state or gonadal hormones (Georgiadis and Kringelbach  ; Pfaus et al.  ; Stoleru et al.  ). However, this is a general issue encountered by any other cross-sectional experiment. We are now looking at the chance to conduct a longitudinal study to solve this issue, which is rather challenging. Thirdly, in studies using patients, drug-na\u00efve subjects are most preferable. In the current study, we did not use subjects in this category, because they are so scarce, especially for patients suffering from pED for at least six months. Alternatively, we controlled the washout period of the drug and strictly made sure that the drugs exerted no influence on the central nervous system during MRI scanning. Moreover, we suggest that these patients should be of great value and interest for clinical neuroscience in that the patients with medication history, rather than drug-na\u00efve state, are the real-life case scenario for most clinical studies. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe current study stemmed from resting state fMRI and investigated a fundamental issue in pED neuroimaging studies. Our results suggested that the deficit in erectile functioning was mirrored in aberrant baseline brain activity in the right AI and the right OFC, which may imply there is an impaired cognitive and motivation component of sexual stimuli processing in pED patients. In particular, our results highlighted the crucial role of the right AI in the pathophysiology of pED; our follow-up study would investigate how the brain network which is anchored in this region is distinguished from that of healthy controls. Furthermore, our study may put forward a more subtle conception of insular influence on pED, which would help foster new specific, mechanistic insights. Last but not least, by introducing sexuality from a neuroplastic perspective, we suggest that our study has provided a new angle exploring the neural substrates of pED and may shed light on the neural pathology underlying pED. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tpED (n\u2009=\u200926)\tUnnamed: 2\tNC (n\u2009=\u200926)\tUnnamed: 4\tTwo sample T Test (two tailed)\n\tMean\tSD\tMean\tSD\tp value\nDemographic Data\tDemographic Data\tDemographic Data\tDemographic Data\tDemographic Data\tDemographic Data\nAge (years)\t26.8\t5.0\t28.5\t3.2\t0.19\nEducation (years)\t13.6\t1.8\t14.4\t2.1\t0.17\nBehaviral data\tBehaviral data\tBehaviral data\tBehaviral data\tBehaviral data\tBehaviral data\nIIEF-total*\t30.9\t8.7\t64.1\t5.1\t<\u20090.001\nSAS*\t45.3\t7.0\t39\t7.9\t0.025\nSDS*\t49.3\t8.3\t39\t8.1\t<\u20090.001\n### Caption\nDemographics and behavioral measurements in the pED group and the healthy control group\n### Footer\npED: Psychogenic erectile dysfunction; NC: Normal controls; SD: Standard deviation; IIEF:\u2009International Index of Erectile Function; SAS: Self-rating anxiety scale; SDS: Self-rating depression scale*Denotes significant difference between groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05)\n\n\n## ID: Tab2\n### Label: Table 2\nUnnamed: 0\tHemisphere\tBA\tMNI Coordinates (cluster maxima)\tMNI Coordinates (cluster maxima).1\tMNI Coordinates (cluster maxima).2\tVoxels\tt (cluster maxima)\n\t\t\tx\ty\tz\t\t\nAI\tR\t-\t36\t9\t0\t34.0\t-8.2\nOFC\tR\t11\t25\t57\t-3\t10.0\t-5.8\n### Caption\nSignificant group ALFF differences (pFWE<0.05) between the pED group (n\u2009=\u200926) and the healthy control group (n\u2009=\u200926)\n### Footer\nAI: anterior insula; OFC: orbitofrontal cortex; R : right ; BA : brodmann area;\n\n\n## ID: Tab3\n### Label: Table 3\nUnnamed: 0\tHemisphere\tBA\tMNI Coordinates (cluster maxima)\tMNI Coordinates (cluster maxima).1\tMNI Coordinates (cluster maxima).2\tVoxels\tt (cluster maxima)\n\t\t\tx\ty\tz\t\t\nAI\tR\t-\t34\t14\t4\t124.0\t6.0\n### Caption\nSignificant voxel-wise correlation between ALFF and all the subjects (n\u2009=\u200952) (p\u2009<\u20090.01, Alphasim corrected)\n### Footer\nAI: anterior insula; R : right ; BA : brodmann area;\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6290711, "text_md5": "acc3c78bafe2557dd59d1cbd2e9de23e", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 158], "journal": [159, 178], "publication_year": [180, 184], "title": [195, 300], "keywords": [314, 406], "abstract": [419, 2465], "body": [2474, 34022], "tables": [34035, 35785]}, "batch": 5, "pmid": 29243122, "doi": "10.1007/s11682-017-9805-9", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6290711", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6290711"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6290711\">6290711</a>", "list_title": "PMC6290711  Aberrant baseline brain activity in psychogenic erectile dysfunction patients: a resting state fMRI study"}

We used fMRI to investigate the influence of the 7-repeat allele on BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependency) responses in 26 healthy children and adolescents while they performed a combined stimulus-response Incompatibility Task (IC) and a Time Discrimination Task (TT). \n\n7-repeat non-carriers exhibited increased neural activation of the left middle and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the IC and greater cerebellar activation in the TT. Furthermore, the 7-repeat non-carriers exhibited a stronger coupling in haemodynamic responses between left IFG and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during the IC and between cerebellar activation and brain regions that have high DRD4 density, including the IFG and the ACC during the TT. Our results indicate that the 7-repeat allele influences both regional brain activation patterns as well as connectivity patterns between neural networks of incompatibility and temporal processing. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDopamine plays an important role in normal attention and disorders of attention such as in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ( ,  ). The dopamine receptor genes in particular are of great interest given that they may contribute to diverse aspects of normal and abnormal human behaviour ( ). According to human post-mortem and studies with monkeys, the D4 receptor, which is a D2-like receptor ( ), is expressed in several brain regions related to planning and reward ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). It plays an important role in the prefrontal cortex and in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (see  , for a review). These brain regions are critical for regulating executive functions ( ). A frequently studied polymorphism of the   DRD4   gene, which is located on chromosome 11p15.5, is a 48-base pair variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) in exon III. This region of the   DRD4   gene encodes the third cytoplasmic loop of the D4 receptor, which is responsible for the coupling of a G-protein and activates intracellular responses to dopamine release by changing intracellular cAMP levels ( ). The 48-bp fragment can be repeated from 2 to 11 times ( ). In functional terms, the   DRD4   7-repeat allele seems to alter the function of the encoded receptor by making it less sensitive to dopamine compared to other numbers of repeats ( ,  ). \n\nMost of the evidence concerning the relevance of differences in the expression of the DRD4 receptor and attentional functioning is based on research within the field of ADHD. The association between ADHD and the 48\u00a0bp repeat polymorphism of exon III of the   DRD4   gene is the strongest and most consistently replicated molecular genetic finding in ADHD ( ). A meta-analysis of more than 30 studies found that the   DRD4   7-repeat (  DRD4  -7r) allele increases the risk for ADHD, although this increase is only moderate with a pooled odds ratio of 1.34 ( ,  ). \n\nStudies investigating cognitive differences associated with the different   DRD4  -48\u00a0bp repeat genes in children and adults with ADHD have produced heterogeneous results. Some neuropsychological studies showed that participants carrying the 7-repeat allele indeed performed poorer on tasks of executive functions ( ,  ) than those with other gene variants. In contrast, other studies have reported that children with ADHD who carry the 7-repeat allele have better performance on those tasks ( ,  ). However, some studies have failed to find any differences in attentional performance between carriers of the 7-repeat allele and those without it ( ,  ). There is an obvious lack of studies which deal with the effect of   DRD4   gene variants on attentional and executive functions in healthy participants. In addition, to date, only a limited number of studies used neuroimaging to explore the relationship between the   DRD4   7-repeat allele and differences in brain anatomy or function, although several studies have suggested that neuroimaging methods might be particularly powerful for unravelling gene-brain behavioural relationships ( ). While no other study has yet investigated the impact of   DRD4  -risk alleles on neural networks associated with executive functions, there is first evidence that DRD4 impacts on brain circuits associated with neural responses in brain areas involved in reward processing such as insula and cingulate cortex ( ,  ). Since, genetic variants may have a more direct effect on brain functions than on behavioural phenotypes (e.g.,  ), the aim of the current fMRI study was to explore how genetic variation in the dopamine-regulating gene   DRD4   affects the pattern of neural activation associated with executive functions in typically developing children and adolescents. We decided to investigate children and adolescents since neural networks during development differ from those of adults (see  ,  ) and genetically mediated disorders of attention (such as ADHD) typically have their onset during childhood. We analysed behavioural and BOLD responses in typically developing children using two tasks examining executive functions, a combined stimulus-response Incompatibility Task (IC) and a Time Discrimination Task (TT), with the same set of stimuli for both. The rationale for choosing these two tasks were to analyse neural mechanism underlying two different aspects of executive functions ( ) that are known to be modulated by dopamine ( ,  ) and which are known to be impaired in many subjects with attentional disorders ( ,  ,  ). We predicted that groups with and without the 7-repeat allele would display differences in neural activation patterns, particularly in brain regions with high dopaminergic receptor density such as the prefrontal cortex. Given the functional consequences of the 7-repeat allele ( ) and the association between the risk allele and ADHD ( ), one might hypothesise that 7-repeat-carriers show reduced BOLD responses in brain areas critical for EF task performance, although the unclear and contradicting results of previous neuropsychological studies and the lack of comparable neuroimaging studies hinder a precise prediction of the direction of this effect. \n\nConsecutively, psychophysiological interactions were analysed to further investigate how the   DRD4  -48\u00a0bp repeat gene modulates functional connectivity within neural networks related to executive functions. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nTwenty-six, typically developing 8\u201316-year-old Caucasian children and adolescents (17 boys, 9 girls,   M  \u00a0=\u00a011.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 years) were recruited by board announcements in local primary and secondary schools. All subjects were carefully screened for childhood psychiatric disorders using a standardised semi-structured interview for the diagnosis of mental disorders in children (Unnewehr, 1995;  ; Delmo et al., 2001) and were free of any past or present mental disorders (i.e., ADHD, pervasive developmental disorders, etc.). Each subject's IQ was also estimated based on a short version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children III ( ). An IQ below 85 resulted in exclusion from the study. All participants were screened for any contraindications against fMRI and were trained prior to scanning in a mock fMRI-scanner to familiarise them with the scanner environment. Please note that some data were included in  . The inclusion in this study was based on the availability of blood samples from the participants as well as on the consent given by participants and parents to participate in genetic studies. \n\nThe study was carried out in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained after providing a complete description of the study to the subjects and their parents. Subjects were compensated for their expenses. \n\n\n### Genotyping \n  \nAll participants were genotyped for the   DRD4   48-bp repeat VNTR polymorphism. \n\n summarises the characteristics of the samples.   \nCharacteristics of the   DRD4   groups. \n  \n\nThe groups did not differ significantly with regard to age (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.420), IQ (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.847) or sex distribution (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.206). Genotyping was performed by the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. Polymerase chain reaction fragment length analysis was performed as described previously ( ). Briefly, the 48-bp repeat in the third exon of the   DRD4   gene was amplified using primers D4-42 and D4-3 according to the guidelines outlined by  . PCR products were run in ethidium bromide-stained 2.5% agarose gels. Positive controls for the variant alleles were run in each gel. All genotypes were scored independently by an experienced lab technician and subsequently by one scientist. Discrepancies were resolved unambiguously, either by reaching a consensus or by re-genotyping. \n\n\n### Task, experimental design \n  \nAll participants were asked to perform a combined stimulus-response IC (adapted from  ) and a TT (adapted from  ). In the combined paradigm, each stimulus consisted of two symbols, which were presented consecutively on the left or right side of the screen. The symbols could either be 1 square and 1 heart, or 2 squares or 2 hearts. All symbols were balanced for responses (i.e., the same number of right and left answers were given), symbols, and presentation order. The symbols were presented with a simultaneous onset, but for different durations, with the shorter-duration symbol being presented for 250\u00a0ms (reference item) and the longer-duration symbol being presented from 500\u00a0ms to 600\u00a0ms. Hence, one symbol was presented 250 to 350\u00a0ms longer than the other symbol (average difference\u00a0=\u00a0300\u00a0ms). Responses were given by pressing one of two parallel buttons and communicated using a fibre optic response device. The buttons were situated beside the participant in the scanner and responses were given by using the index or the middle finger of the right hand respectively. In the TT, subjects were instructed to indicate on which side of the screen the symbol was presented longer (e.g. the left hand-side) by pressing the button on the same side (e.g. the left one of the two parallel buttons). In the IC task, subjects were asked to press the button on the same side of the screen on which the second symbol had appeared, if the symbols were identical. If two different symbols were presented, the subject had to press the button opposite to the position of the second symbol (i.e., a spatially incompatible response). The ratio of compatible/incompatible trials in the IC task, as well as the difference in symbol presentation length in the TT, was varied to create two levels of task difficulty. In the TT, the easier condition had a mean presentation difference of 350\u00a0ms (low task difficulty, TT_low), while the more difficult condition had a mean presentation difference of 250\u00a0ms (high task difficulty, TT_high) ( ). In the IC task, the easier condition consisted of a slightly higher ratio of incompatible trials (60:40%, IC_low), while the more difficult condition had a much higher ratio of incompatible trials (80:20%, IC_high) ( ). Block design was employed with blocks of either TT or IC trials. In addition, task difficulty was manipulated in a blockwise manner. However, since functional data analyses did not reveal a significant effect of task difficulty on neural activation patterns for both task conditions, blocks of high and low task difficulty were combined in further data analyses. \n\nThe experiment consisted of 4 runs; each run had 4 blocks of the same task. To minimise working memory load, the specific task symbol was presented for 1500\u00a0ms at the beginning of each block (every 10th stimulus). There were 15-sec breaks between each run serving as a low-level baseline condition. Stimuli were presented using a visual stimulation device (goggles, Silent Vision\u2122, Avotec, FL, USA). \n\n\n### Data acquisition \n  \nA SONATA MRI system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) operating at 1.5\u00a0T was used to obtain T2*-weighted echoplanar (EPI) images with BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependency) contrast (matrix size: 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064; voxel size: 3.12\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.12\u00a0mm). In total, 266 volumes of 30 4-mm-thick axial slices were acquired sequentially with a 0.8-mm gap (repetition time\u00a0=\u00a03.2\u00a0s, echo time\u00a0=\u00a066\u00a0ms). The first five volumes were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration effects. Images were spatially realigned to the first volume to correct for inter-scan movement and were normalised to a standard EPI template (resampled to 3\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm voxels). The data were then smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8-mm, full-width at half-maximum to accommodate inter-subject anatomical variability. A high-pass filter (using a cut-off of 512\u00a0s) and a correction for temporal autocorrelation in the data (AR 1\u00a0+\u00a0white noise) were applied to accommodate serial correlations. After the acquisition of the functional scan (\u223c14.2\u00a0min), high-resolution T1-weighed anatomical brain scans were collected using a rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) pulse sequence (TE\u00a0=\u00a03.93\u00a0ms, TR\u00a0=\u00a02200\u00a0ms,   \u03b1  \u00a0=\u00a015\u00b0, FOV\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0mm, matrix size\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256, voxel size\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm, 160 slices, slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mm). \n\n\n### Statistical analyses of the imaging data \n  \nData were analysed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM2, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London ( ;  ) using random-effects models. There was no significant effect of task difficulty. Therefore, we performed a first-level analysis incorporating the five conditions (i.e., TT_high, TT_low, IC_high, IC_low, and the baseline condition or BL) into one design matrix. For each session, the five conditions were modulated as a boxcar function convolved with the synthetic haemodynamic response function (HRF). The six head movement parameters were included as confounds. Estimated motion parameters were examined on a subject-by-subject basis to ensure that the amount of absolute motion did not exceed 3\u00a0mm. \n\nAll subjects exhibited less than 1.5\u00a0mm of absolute motion over the course of the experiment and genotype groups did not differ with respect to the total amount of head movement during the scan. \n\nThe first-level analysis was primarily designed to identify neural networks that were activated by the two tasks. Thus, for each participant, condition-specific effects were estimated according to a general linear model, with parameter estimates passed into a second-level one-sample   t  -test with non-sphericity correction. The condition-specific effects were as follows: TT (TT_high\u00a0+\u00a0TT_low)\u00a0>\u00a0BL and IC (IC_high\u00a0+\u00a0IC_low)\u00a0>\u00a0BL. These random-effects analyses assessed the data based on inter-subject variance and thereby allowed for inferences about the population from which the subjects were drawn. Two-sample   t  -tests were performed on contrast images to investigate differences in neural activation between the 7-repeat present and the 7-repeat absent groups. We used a region-of-interest (ROI)-based approach with a height threshold of   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE (family wise error)-corrected, restricting our analyses to those ROIs known to be activated by our executive tasks. These areas were the prefrontal cortex ( ,  ) the parietal cortex ( ) as well as the cerebellum ( ,  ). Anatomical ROIs were constructed using the WFU Pickatlas software ( ,  ). For all ROI analyses, small volume corrections were applied across each respective region. \n\nIn addition, in order to determine gene effects on brain areas commonly involved in both, the IC and TT tasks, we performed a random effects conjunction analysis, based on inclusive masking, as suggested by  . This conservative analysis corresponds to a logical AND operation, showing those voxels, which are significant in both the TT Task (TT_high\u00a0+\u00a0TT_low)\u00a0>\u00a0BL and IC Task (IC_high\u00a0+\u00a0IC_low)\u00a0>\u00a0BL. For this analysis, the threshold for each contrast entered into a conjunction analysis was set at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected. Between-group differences between genotypes were then reported at a threshold of   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE (family wise error)-corrected across the whole brain. \n\nNeural activation was localised using the anatomy toolbox developed by  . In addition, SPM(T)images were overlaid on the averaged group T1-image, which was calculated from the subjects\u2019 normalised T1-images. \n\nTo further explore the influences of genotype on the functional associations between different brain areas, we conducted psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses. Based on the results of the two-sample   t  -tests, the maxima of the genotype-dependent differential activation patterns obtained in the BOLD signal time course were used as seeds for a PPI analyses (see also  ). A PPI analysis attempts to explain neural responses in one brain area in terms of its interactions with other brain regions and cognitive/sensory processes. Thus, a psychophysiological interaction can be interpreted as a condition-specific change in the coupling of neural activation between brain regions. The PPI analysis consists of a design matrix with three regressors: (i) the \u201cpsychological variable\u201d, representing the cognitive/sensory process of interest, (ii) the \u201cphysiological variable\u201d, representing the neural response in a given brain region, and (iii) the interaction between (i) and (ii). \n\nThe psychological variable used in the current study was a vector coding for the specific task convolved with the HRF. The individual time series for the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the cerebellum, respectively, were obtained by extracting the first principal component from all raw voxel time series in a sphere (8-mm radius) centred on the coordinates of the subject-specific activations. These time series were mean-corrected and high-pass filtered to remove low-frequency signal drifts. This process produced the physiological factor that was then multiplied by the psychological factor to produce the interaction term. PPI analyses were then carried out for each subject by creating a design matrix with the interaction term, the psychological factor, and the physiological factor as regressors. Subject-specific contrast images using the contrast [1\u00a00\u00a00], where the first column represented the interaction term, were then entered into a random-effects group analysis, comparing the groups according to genotype (7-repeat absent versus 7-repeat present). Task-specific ROI-analyses were performed (prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, cerebellum) with a significance threshold set at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons, extent threshold   k  \u00a0>\u00a05. We decided for this more liberal threshold since PPI analyses are inherently less powered than their univariate counterparts (as only the unshared variance between the three regressors is attributed to the interaction term). Voxels that surpassed the threshold in these PPI analyses can be interpreted as showing a genotype-based difference in connectivity with the seed region as a function of EF task ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Genotyping \n  \nCarriers of the 7-repeat allele were equally distributed across boys and girls (7-repeat absent: 10 males, 6 females; 7-repeat present: 7 males, 3 females). The groups did not differ significantly with respect to age or IQ (see  ). The   n   values were as follows: 7-repeat absent,   N  \u00a0=\u00a016 and 7-repeat present,   N  \u00a0=\u00a010; the most common   DRD4   allele was the 4-repeat allele (84.6% with 50% homozygous), followed by the 7-repeat allele (38.5%) and the 2-repeat allele (19.2%). Other   DRD4   gene variants were rare. Genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. \n\n\n### Behavioural results \n  \nMixed-model ANOVAs with the factors TASK and GROUP were calculated to analyse the percent correct responses and the reaction times (RTs). \n\n Number of correct responses  : ANOVA for the percent correct responses revealed no significant main effect of group (  F  \u00a0=\u00a00.003,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.96) or task (  F  \u00a0=\u00a00.245,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.625) as well as no significant interaction effect (  F  \u00a0=\u00a00.237,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.631). \n\n Reaction times  : ANOVA models with RTs as dependent variables revealed no significant main effect of group (  F  \u00a0=\u00a00.061,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.808) or task (  F  \u00a0=\u00a00.27,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.872) as well as no significant interaction effect (  F  \u00a0=\u00a00.004,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.949). \n\nSince the groups did not differ in terms of behavioural performance, we could examine the effects of genotypes on brain activity independently of significant behavioural group differences. \n\n\n### Functional results \n  \nTwo-sample   t  -tests were performed on contrast images to investigate group differences in neural activation between the   DRD4   groups (7-repeat allele non-carrier versus 7-repeat allele carrier). The results stem from the ROI-analyses described under Section  . Consistent with our hypothesis, the groups had significantly different BOLD responses during the IC task in frontal cortical areas involved in executive functions, specifically, in the left IFG and left middle frontal gyrus using a ROI-based analysis (  x  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221236,   y  \u00a0=\u00a030,   z  \u00a0=\u00a012;   T  \u00a0=\u00a05.28,   p  -FWE-corrected\u00a0<\u00a00.05,   k  \u00a0=\u00a040). The 7-repeat present group had significantly decreased haemodynamic responses compared to the 7-repeat absent group (see   and B).   \n(A) Genotype based analysis of the BOLD response during the Incompatibility Task.

In accordance with the pattern of neural activation observed during the IC task, the 7-repeat present group had significantly decreased haemodynamic responses compared to the 7-repeat absent group (see   and B).   \n(A) Genotype based analysis of the BOLD response during the Time Discrimination Task.

Contrast: 7-repeat absent\u00a0>\u00a07-repeat present. \n  \n\n\n### PPI analysis \n  \nBased on the genotype-dependent between-group differences, the BOLD signal time courses at the local maxima in specific regions within the IFG (  x  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221236,   y  \u00a0=\u00a030,   z  \u00a0=\u00a012) for the IC task and within the cerebellum (  x  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221215,   y  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221248,   z  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221236) for the TT were entered into PPI analyses at the second level. ROI analyses were performed (see Section  ) and are presented in the following. During the IC task, the connectivity analysis revealed that there were differences between the   DRD4   genotypes in the association between haemodynamic responses in the left IFG and the ACC (ROI-analysis:   x  \u00a0=\u00a06,   y  \u00a0=\u00a027,   z  \u00a0=\u00a024;   T  \u00a0=\u00a03.60,   p  -uncorrected\u00a0<\u00a00.001,   k  \u00a0=\u00a050), as shown in  . Carriers of the   DRD4  -7 repeat allele showed reduced coupling between the interhemispheric inferior frontal brain regions compared to non-carriers of the risk allele.   \n(A) Genotype based group comparison of the psychophysiological interactions associated with the left inferior frontal gyrus and connectivity strength between the left IFG and the ACC during the Incompatibility Task.

(B) Genotype based group comparison psychophysiological interactions associated with the left inferior frontal gyrus and connectivity strength between the cerebellum and associated brain regions during the Time Discrimination Task. Contrast: 7-repeat absent\u00a0>\u00a07-repeat present. \n  \n\nDuring the TT, the correlation between haemodynamic responses in the cerebellum, the right IFG (ROI-analysis:   x  \u00a0=\u00a045,   y  \u00a0=\u00a024,   z  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221215;   T  \u00a0=\u00a03.61,   p  -uncorrected\u00a0<\u00a00.001,   k  \u00a0=\u00a05) and the ACC (ROI-analysis:   x  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22123,   y  \u00a0=\u00a036,   z  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22126;   T  \u00a0=\u00a03.54,   p  -uncorrected\u00a0<\u00a00.001,   k  \u00a0=\u00a025) was different with respect to   DRD4   genotype, as evident in  . Again, there was a reduction of the correlation of haemodynamic responses in the 7-repeat present group relative to the 7-repeat absent group. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe results of the present study confirmed that the genotype of the   DRD4  -48\u00a0bp repeat affects neural activation patterns in children and adolescents during both the response IC and the TT, two tasks that tap the executive domain. In line with our hypothesis, we found that carriers of the DRD-4 risk allele showed reduced prefrontal and cerebellar brain activation during EF tasks, similarly to findings previously described for subjects with ADHD (see  ,   for a meta-analysis). During the IC, we found   DRD4  -48\u00a0bp repeat gene-dependent differences in neural activation patterns in the left IFG. Coupling differences were observed between left IFG and ACC. The location of genotype dependent differences in neural activation patterns during the IC task is in line with other studies showing that the IFG and ACC are important for individual differences in executive functioning ( ,  ). The conjunction analysis also confirmed main gene effects on left prefrontal cortex activity located in the middle frontal gyrus. During TT, there were   DRD4  -48\u00a0bp repeat gene-dependent differences in neural activation patterns in the cerebellum, as well as differences in neural connectivity between the ACC, IFG and SPG. For both the IC and TT, haemodynamic responses and connectivity were higher in the group with 7-repeat allele non-carriers compared to the group of 7-repeat allele carriers. The analysis of psychophysiological interactions revealed that there were genotype-based differences in the functional coupling of haemodynamic responses between brain regions that are known to interact during executive functioning ( ). These differences in functional associations indicate that a specific genotype not only modulates activity in circumscribed brain regions but also has a significant effect on connectivity between brain regions. \n\nAt first glance, the genotype-dependent differences in neural activation patterns during the TT may seem unexpected given that the cerebellum does not have a high density of D4 receptors ( ). In general, cerebellar activation is observed during time processing tasks, and cognitive models of time perception have implicated the cerebellum in the regulation of timing mechanisms in particular if very small time difference (<1\u00a0s) have to be detected ( ). However,   found differences in cerebellar volume between 7-repeat allele carriers and those without this gene variant in 24 participants with ADHD, suggesting that there are   DRD4  -48\u00a0bp repeat gene-dependent effects on cerebellar structures. To further explore this issue, psychophysiological interactions were calculated. The results revealed that the 7-repeat non-carriers exhibited greater coupling between cerebellar activity and haemodynamic responses in the ACC and IFG, than did the 7-repeat carriers. This difference in neural connectivity between the cerebellum and brain regions with dense DRD4 receptor expression may help to explain the influence of the   DRD4  -48\u00a0bp repeat gene on cerebellar activity during the TT. \n\nUnfortunately, to date no other functional neuroimaging study has investigated the association between the same   DRD4   polymorphism and neural networks of executive functions. Therefore, replication of this study is urgently needed. However, the results are in line with previous fMRI studies that demonstrated the importance of genetic differences of D2-type receptors, to which the D4 receptor belongs on neural networks associated with planning, feedback-based learning and reward ( ,  ,  ). For example,   studied the insertion/deletion of a guanosine residue at the upstream position \u22121217 of the DRD4 gene and found greater conflict-related brain activity in the ACC in participants carrying the insertion variant of the polymorphism. Moreover,   demonstrated that presence of the A1-allele, leading to a reduced receptor density, is associated with a reduced BOLD response to negative feedback in the medial prefrontal cortex. In line with this, carriers of the DRD4 allele in our study showed a reduced response to the cognitive stimuli of both our tasks, which might be related to the 7-repeat allele's modulation of subsensitivity of the DRD4 receptor. Although the transcriptional effects of this polymorphism are not completely known ( ,  ) one might speculate that a subsensitive dopamine receptor might result in a reduced neural response to cognitive stimuli as well as altered connectivity between different brain regions. This line of argumentation could also support those neuropsychological findings that demonstrated the presence of the 7-repeat allele as a risk factor for impairments in executive functions and may go hand in hand with the associations between this polymorphism and ADHD ( ,  ). \n\nHowever, in our study we could not replicate the behavioural results found in neuropsychological studies that investigated differences between carriers of the   DRD4   7-repeat allele and carriers of other gene variants. This lack of behavioural differences could probably stem from the lack of power or could be due to the fact that our sample was composed of healthy subjects whereas other neuropsychological studies were conducted mainly with patients with ADHD. However, given the fact that behavioural results have been contradictory so far, the lack of behavioural differences in the present study gave us the opportunity to focus on functional differences in haemodynamic responses without accounting for behavioural variation. As has been shown earlier ( ,  ) functional neuroimaging can unravel differences in neural processes that remain undetected by neuropsychological measures. Additionally, it has to be noted that in previous studies children or adolescents with ADHD were compared to each other or healthy controls regarding their genotype whereas we compared a sample of healthy participants. Thus, we avoided to confound diagnosis with genotype effects. \n\nOur results confirmed the hypothesis on the influence of the   DRD4  -48\u00a0bp repeat gene on neural activation patterns and task-dependent connectivity patterns between brain areas associated with executive functions. Modulation of cerebellar activity by the   DRD4  -48\u00a0bp repeat gene could be explained by genotype-dependent differences in functional coupling between the cerebellum and the ACC, IFG. Thus, our connectivity analyses provide important information by showing that there is an association between genotype and the functional connectivity between cerebellar activation and activation in brain areas that have a high density of DRD4 receptors. However, given the more liberal threshold chosen for the connectivity analyses (not corrected for multiple comparisons), our findings have to be considered with caution and require replication in independent samples. \n\nOverall, our findings confirm an influence of   DRD4  -genotype on prefrontal functioning during typical development which has not been shown consistently in neuropsychological measures. Thus, the inclusion of neuroimaging will remain important and indispensable to further explore the relationship between genotype and executive functions. \n\n\n## Conflict of interest \n  \nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: tbl0005\n### Label: Table 1\nDRD4-genotype\t7-repeat-absent\t7-repeat-absent\t7-repeat-present\t7-repeat-present\nN\tOverall\t16\tOverall\t10\nUnnamed: 0_level_2\tMale\t10\tMale\t7\nUnnamed: 0_level_3\tFemale\t6\tFemale\t3\nUnnamed: 0_level_4\tMin\u2013Max\tM (SD)\tMin\u2013Max\tM (SD)\nAge\t8.0\u201315.0\t11.7 (2.4)\t9.1\u20134.1\t11.0 (2.0)\nIQ\t85\u2013126\t103.1 (12.0)\t83\u2013118\t102.0 (13.3)\nIC reaction time (ms)\t628\u20131105\t930 (153)\t601\u20131136\t921 (148)\nIC error rate (%)\t00\u201348.07\t21.21 (19.95)\t3.57\u201341.14\t23.75 (25.85)\nTT reaction time (ms)\t758\u20131157\t937 (90)\t718\u20131155\t924 (151)\nTT error rate (%)\t1.25\u201347.5\t21.17 (22.59)\t1.25\u201347.5\t19.38 (17.33)\n### Caption\nCharacteristics of the DRD4 groups.\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: tbl0010\n### Label: Table 2\nTask\tAnalysis\tk\tp-FWE-corrected\tT\tx\u00a0y\u00a0z\tAnatomical region\nIC\tROI\t40.0\t0.001\t5.28\t\u221236\u00a030\u00a012\tLeft inferior frontal gyrus\nTT\tROI\t16.0\t0.001\t4.54\t15\u00a0\u221248\u00a0\u221236\tCerebellum\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nConjunction IC\u2229TT\tWholebrain\t18.0\t0.002\t6.25\t\u221239\u00a039\u00a024\tLeft middle frontal gyrus\nConjunction IC\u2229TT\t\t11.0\t0.003\t6.1\t\u221236\u00a030\u00a09\tLeft middle frontal gyrus\n### Caption\nSummary of results.

However, the potential neurological mechanisms of these symptoms remain unclear. \n\n Method  : Forty-one patients with mildly to moderately active UC, as well as 42 matched healthy controls, were recruited for an examination using psychological scales, cognitive function tests and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Seed points were identified   via   analysis of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and functional connectivity (FC) was calculated between these seed regions and other voxels in the whole brain. Correlation analyses were performed among clinical indexes, neuropsychological assessments and neuroimaging data. \n\n Result  : Compared with the healthy controls, patients with UC exhibited lower ALFF values in the bilateral hippocampal/parahippocampal (HIPP/ParaHIPP) region and higher ALFF values in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC.L) and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG.L). With HIPP/ParaHIPP as the seed point, the strengths of the FC in the bilateral middle frontal gyri (MFG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and left caudate nucleus (CAU.L) increased; using the PCC.L as the seed point, the strengths of the FC in the middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and the left angular gyrus (AUG.L) increased. These abnormal brain regions were mainly located in the limbic system. By analyzing the correlations between these brain regions and behavioral data, we observed a close correlation between decreased HIPP/ParaHIPP activity and memory loss; increased PCC activity and strength of FC with the AUG.L were related to dysfunction of executive function and attention network in patients with UC. \n\n Conclusion  : Based on these results, the limbic lobe might be the core of the brain-gut axis (BGA) and play an important role in cognitive impairments, suggesting potential mechanisms for cognitive impairment in patients with UC in the active stage of the disease. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nUlcerative colitis (UC), a kind of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is an idiopathic, chronic inflammatory state of the colonic mucosa that is often characterized by bloody diarrhea (Ord\u00e3 et al.,  ). Recovery is often difficult, with alternating periods of remission and activity that seriously affect the patient\u2019s psychology and cognitive function (Han et al.,  ). Almost all patients with UC suffer from neuropsychiatric problems, including anxiety, depression, inattention, and insomnia. Cognitive impairment may also be more obvious and prominent in patients with UC during the active stage of the disease. However, the mechanisms underlying these symptoms in patients with UC remain to be explored. \n\nGut inflammation and brain cognitive function in brain may be connected neurologically. The brain-gut axis (BGA) hypothesis offers one explanation for the correlation between biological behavior, emotions and cognitive functions in subjects with UC (Mayer et al.,  ). According to the study by Agostini, the dysfunction of the amygdala in the BGA influences emotional processing in patients with UC during remission (Agostini et al.,  ). As shown in the study by JS Huang, the BGA may also play a central role in the perception of somatic pain stimuli in the brains of patients with IBD (Huang et al.,  ). BGA function has also been observed in many neuroimaging studies of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease (Bao et al.,  ; Agostini et al.,  ). However, further studies are needed to determine whether BGA-related functional areas are abnormally activated in the brains of patients with active UC during the resting state. Furthermore, the correlation between cognitive impairment and the BGA in patients with UC remains unclear. \n\nIn the present study, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to investigate the spontaneous neural activity and functional connectivity (FC) in the brain of patients with UC. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was used to detect alterations in regional brain activity. The ALFF reflects spontaneous neural activity in the cerebral region (Zhou et al.,  ) and has been widely employed to explore the latent mechanism of psychosomatic diseases, such as schizophrenia, insomnia, and Parkinson\u2019s disease (Zhou et al.,  ). Whole-brain FC analyses were used to explore aberrant activity across brain regions, and time-related analysis of covariation with seed point ALFF was performed to identify peak points of brain regions as seeds for FC analyses (Biswal et al.,  ). The FC strength between the seed point and the altered brain area was used to identify the latent mechanisms of neurocognitive impairments in patients with UC. We hypothesized that regional and network-level brain functions associated with the BGA of patients with mildly to moderately active UC were altered and that the changes correlated with the results of neuropsychiatric evaluations. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nThe study protocol was approved by the local Medical Research Ethics Committee of Xinqiao Hospital (Chongqing, China), and the study was conducted in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations. Forty-one right-handed patients with UC (age range: 20\u201354 years, mean age: 37.1 \u00b1 9.1 years, 16 females) were recruited from the IBD Clinic Center of Xinqiao Hospital and provided written informed consent after receiving a detailed description of the study procedures and aims. \n\nInclusion criteria were: (1) age 18\u201355 years; (2) education \u22656 school years; (3) mildly to moderately active UC (Mayo scores: 3\u201310; Lewis et al.,  ); and (4) right-handedness. \n\nExclusion criteria were: (1) clinical remission (Mayo scores <3) or severe UC [these patients were excluded because they usually need to take corticosteroids and accurate results from neuropsychological tests are difficult to obtain (Sands et al.,  )]; (2) use of corticosteroids and psychotropic drugs in the past 6 months; (3) UC-related abdominal surgery; (4) previous or present neuro-associated diseases, such as psychosis, head tumor, or disturbance of consciousness; (5) claustrophobia; and (6) metallic implants present in the body. \n\nForty-two right-handed healthy controls (HCs; age range: 22\u201355 years, mean age: 36.86 \u00b1 9.02 years, 17 females) were included in this study. Controls were matched with patients for age, sex, and education and were recruited from Xinqiao Hospital (Chongqing, China) using advertisements. None of the subjects in the HC group were taking any medication, had gastrointestinal or pain-related diseases, or tested positive in the colonoscopy. Similar to the UC group, MRI data from participants in the HC group whose maximum head motion exceeded 2.0 mm or 2.0\u00b0 were rejected. \n\n\n### Experimental Design \n  \nAll patients underwent a systemic gastrointestinal examination, including a colonoscopy and pathological examination of a biopsy. The colonoscopies were completed in a 4-week period, and laboratory tests were performed within the 2 weeks before MRI. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), platelet (PLT) counts, and Mayo scores were recorded for all patients. All participants performed neuropsychological assessments and cognitive function testing; before these tests, we ensured that subjects completely understood the rules. After explaining the test, we performed MRI scans on the subjects. MRI data were acquired during an approximately 10-min resting-state period. \n\n\n### Clinical Symptoms Assessment and Neuropsychological Testing \n  \nEach subject underwent a series of related psychometrical assessments and clinical scales. Cognitive function tests were performed using the E-prime program. The mood tests included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Hinz and Br\u00e4hler,  ), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS, a 20-question self-reporting inventory designed to evaluate levels of depressive symptoms) and Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS, a 20-item self-reporting assessment device designed to measure anxiety levels). Clinical symptoms were mainly measured using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ, a questionnaire used to evaluate patient quality of life; Ren et al.,  ), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). \n\nWe used three measures to evaluate cognition in each subject, including attention, executive function, and working memory. The Attention Network Task (ANT) provides efficiency measures of the alerting, orienting, and executive control networks (ECNs; Fossella et al.,  ; Fan et al.,  ). The Stroop Color-Word Test was used to evaluate executive function, and the memory of each subject was evaluated using a two-back working memory task. All three tests were performed in the E-prime program. During the tests, the accuracy of the answers and the mean reaction times (RTs) were recorded to reflect the test results. \n\n\n### Image Data Acquisition \n  \nEach subject underwent rs-fMRI scanning on a 3.0-T GE MRI system equipped with a standard eight-channel phased-array head coil. During scanning, all patients were ordered to keep their eyes closed and to not fall asleep, remain equanimous, and have no systematic cognitive or motor activity. The echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence was applied to collect resting-state functional images using the following parameters: slices = 34; slice thickness = 5 mm, slice gap = 0 mm; TE = 30 ms, TR = 2,300 ms, flip angle (FA) = 90\u00b0, field of view (FOV) = 240 \u00d7 240 mm , matrix = 64 \u00d7 64 and isotropic voxel size = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm . We collected 270 time points for approximately 621 s from each subject. A set of high-resolution T1-weighted structural images was collected by applying a three-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo (3DSPGR) sequence with the following parameters: slices = 124; slice thickness = 1.6 mm, slice gap = 0 mm; TE = 2.8 ms, TR = 450 ms, FA = 15\u00b0, FOV = 240 \u00d7 240 mm , matrix = 256 \u00d7 256 and isotropic voxel size = 1.6 \u00d7 1.6 \u00d7 1.6 mm . \n\n\n### Image Data Preprocessing \n  \nMRI data were preprocessed using the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI Advanced Edition , which is based on MATLAB 8.2.0.701 (R2013b). Because of the time required for magnetization equilibrium and participant adjustment to the new and noisy environment, the first 10 volumes of each functional image were deleted. The remaining 260 functional images were slice-time corrected to reduce the differences in images from different times and realigned for head motion. Subjects whose maximum head motion was beyond 2.0 mm in any direction or whose maximum head rotation was beyond 2.0\u00b0 in any angular dimension were excluded. The high-resolution T1-weighted structural images were then coregistered with the functional images. Next, the whole brain was segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Subsequently, the regression of nuisance covariates was performed, including Friston 24-parameter correction and head motion scrubbing with thresholds of approximately 0.5 mm. Meanwhile, noisy signals from the CSF and WM were also regressed. Retaining or removing the global brain signals is controversial; we chose to retain the global signals. Then, all the data were normalized into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template, and each voxel size was resampled at 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm and filtered at the 0.01\u20130.08 Hz band. Finally, we set a Gaussian kernel of 6-mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) to conduct spatial smoothing. In addition, detrending was used to remove the linear trends. \n\nThe whole-brain ALFF was calculated for each subject using the preprocessed images with temporal bandpass filtering (0.01 <   f   < 0.08 Hz), which reduces low-frequency drift and high-frequency respiratory and cardiac noise. The subject-level voxelwise ALFF map was converted into a z-score map by subtracting the mean ALFF of the whole brain and dividing by the standard deviation (Li et al.,  ). FC was calculated in MATLAB using the rs-fMRI data analysis toolkit (REST v1.8) . The peak points of the ALFF analysis were selected as the coordinates of those regions of interest (ROIs), and the radius was set as 6 mm. Seed-based FC maps were calculated between the time courses of seed regions and the time series of all voxels in the global brain by Pearson\u2019s correlation analyses. Finally, Fisher\u2019s r-to-z transformation was applied to all maps of before statistical analysis. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Independent sample   t  -tests were used to analyze differences in the clinical and neuropsychological data between the two groups (41 patients and 42 HCs). Additionally, if the variable did not exhibit a normal distribution, the Mann-Whitney rank test was used for analysis. The chi-square test was used to detect differences in sex, which was the categorical variable. All   p   values were two-sided, and statistical significance was set to   p   < 0.05. \n\nWe investigated differences in ALFF and FC in the 41 patients with UC compared with the 42 HCs. Analysis of the ALFF and FC maps were performed with SPM8 . Age, sex, and educational level were used as covariates during the two-sample   t  -test calculation. First, we used the topological false discovery rate (FDR) to correct for multiple comparisons (Chumbley et al.,  ), which is a rigid approach for spm maps. For all of the aforementioned analyses, we set a voxel-level threshold of   p   = 0.001 and an FDR statistical significance of   p   < 0.05; the FDR correction was applied to multiple comparisons in the whole brain. Meanwhile, a GM group mask was utilized in the ALFF and FC calculations. Second, small volume correction (SVC) was applied over the following cerebral regions: frontal gyrus, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and cingulate cortex. In previous studies, these brain regions were aberrantly altered in patients with UC (Agostini et al.,  ; Gray et al.,  ). SVC was conducted by applying a familywise error (FWE) correction of   p   < 0.05 and a cluster size threshold of 20 contiguous voxels in the brain region (Vachon et al.,  ). Compared with FDR correction, SVC correction is a hypothesis-driven analysis approach for multiple comparisons, specifically within ROIs instead of using other stricter corrections for the whole brain (Torres et al.,  ). \n\nPearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were calculated to assess relationships among clinical measures, neuropsychological results, ALFF values, and the intensity of FC in patients with UC. Calculations were performed using SPSS software after eliminating the influences of age, sex, and education, and statistical significance was set to   p   < 0.05. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Clinical Characteristics and Neuropsychological Results \n  \nThe results of the statistical analysis of demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological characteristics between patients with UC and HCs are shown in  . The demographics, including age, sex, and education level, were not significantly different between the two groups. Compared with the HC group, patients with UC showed prominently lower scores on the IBDQ. The PSQI, VAS, and PSS scores of the UC group were significantly higher than those of the HC group. The HADS, SAS, and SDS scores were also significantly different between the two groups. Patients with UC scored higher on the emotion scales than the HC group. Additionally, the results of the neuropsychological assessments showed that the UC group had a longer alerting time, executive time, two-back working memory RT, and Stroop test RT but a lower accuracy rating in the two-back working memory and Stroop tests. The two groups did not differ significantly in the orienting effect time. \n  \nDemographics, clinical data, mood and cognitive performance among Ulcerative colitis (UC) and healthy control (HC). \n  \n Abbreviations: CPR, C-reactive protein; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; PLT, platelet count; IBDQ, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire; HADS, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; SAS, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale; SDS, Self-Rating Depression Scale; PSQI, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; VAS, Visual Analogue Scale; ANT, Attention Network Task; ACC, accuracy rating; RT, reaction time.

Patients with UC displayed increased ALFF values, with the peak differences in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG.L) and the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC.L), and decreased ALFF values in the bilateral hippocampus/parahippocampus (HIPP/ParaHIPP). We select the aforementioned peak points as seeds for further FC analyses. The results are summarized in  . \n  \nSignificantly increased (red) and decreased (blue) amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) values in patients with active-stage ulcerative colitis (UC) compared with healthy controls [HCs; peak level threshold   p   = 0.001, cluster level false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected   p   < 0.05]. The color bar represents the   t  -value of the two-sample   t  -test between the two groups. \n    \nALFF alterations between the UC and HC groups. \n  \n Notes: MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; ALFF, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations; BA, Brodmann area; Hem, hemisphere; HIPP/ParaHIPP, hippocampus/parahippocampus; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex; MFG, middle frontal gyri; false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected, p < 0.05  . \n  \n\n### FC Analysis \n  \nThree peak points, including the MFG.L, PCC.L and HIPP/ParaHIPP, were set as seed points; two-sample   t  -tests were performed in SPM8 to identify significantly altered FC between seed points with the whole brain ( ). \n  \nFC alterations between the UC and HC groups. \n  \n Notes: FC, functional connectivity; MFG, middle frontal gyri; ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; CAU, caudate nucleus; MCC, middle cingulate cortex; ANG, angular gyrus; IOG, inferior occipital gyrus; IPL, inferior parietal lobule; SFG, superior frontal gyrus.  FDR-corrected   p   < 0.05.  Small volume-corrected (FWE-corrected at   p   < 0.05) with a cluster size threshold of 20 contiguous voxels  . \n  \nUsing the HIPP/ParaHIPP, whose peak point was (Postle and D\u2019Esposito,  ; Mayer et al.,  ; Sands et al.,  ), as the first seed point, a significantly increased FC strength was revealed in some brain regions, including the bilateral middle frontal gyri (MFG), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the left caudate nucleus (CAU.L;   p   < 0.05, FDR-corrected or SVC-corrected;  ). \n  \nDifferences in functional connectivity (FC) between various brain regions between patients with active-stage UC and HCs. The peak level threshold was set to   p   = 0.001, and the cluster level FDR-corrected threshold was set to   p   < 0.05. The FC between the seed point and left caudate nucleus (CAU.L) used the small volume correction (SVC)-corrected   p   value familywise error (FWE-corrected   p   < 0.05). The blue node was the seed point and all the FC strengths were increased. \n  \nUsing the peak point (\u221215, \u221266, 12) of the PCC.L as the second seed point, significantly increased FC strength was observed in the middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and the left angular gyrus (ANG.L). In addition, decreased FC strength was revealed in the right inferior occipital gyrus (IOG.R;   p   < 0.05, FDR-corrected;  ). \n  \nDifferences in whole-brain FC between patients with active-stage UC and HCs. The peak level threshold was set to   p   = 0.001, and the cluster level FDR-corrected threshold was set to   p   < 0.05. The purple node represents the seed point, the purple lines indicate an increased FC strength and the blue line indicates a decreased FC strength. \n  \nUsing the peak point (\u221218, \u22126, 57) of the MFG.L as the third seed point, increased FC strength was revealed in some brain regions, including the brainstem, right inferior parietal lobule (IPL.R), and right superior frontal gyrus (SFG.R;   p   < 0.05, FDR-corrected;  ). \n  \nDifferences in whole-brain FC between patients with active-stage UC and HCs. The peak level threshold was set to   p   = 0.001, and the cluster level FDR-corrected threshold was set to   p   < 0.05. The purple node represents the seed point; all FC strengths were increased. \n  \n\n### Correlation Among Clinical Data, Neuropsychological Data, and Aberrant ALFF and FC Values \n  \nAfter controlling for age, sex, and educational level, we performed a partial correlation analysis of the UC group. First, the disease duration was positively correlated with the two-back RT (  p =   0.018  , r =   0.367). Subsequently, RT in the two-back working memory test was negatively correlated with the decreased ALFF value of the HIPP/ParaHIPP and negatively correlated with the increased FC strength between the HIPP/ParaHIPP and CAU.L (  p   = 0.008,   r   = \u22120.411;   p   = 0.026,   r   = \u22120.347, respectively). Moreover, the RT of the Stroop test was positively correlated with the increased ALFF value of the PCC.L and negatively correlated with increased FC strength between the HIPP/ParaHIPP and ACC (  p   = 0.023,   r   = 0.355;   p   = 0.037,   r   = \u22120.327, respectively). Additionally, the alerting effect of the ANT was positively correlated with the ALFF value of PCC.L and negatively correlated with the increased FC strength between the PCC.L and AUG.L (  p   = 0.008,   r   = 0.408;   p   = 0.029,   r   = \u22120.342, respectively). Besides, the PSS was positively correlated with the increased FC strength between PCC.L and MCC (  p   = 0.016,   r   = 0.374). Finally, the increased FC strength between the MFG.L and IPL.R was negatively correlated with the SDS and SAS scores (  p   = 0.018,   r   = \u22120.367;   p   = 0.011,   r   = \u22120.393, respectively). These correlation analyses are illustrated in  . \n  \nScatter diagrams showing the significant correlations between aberrant ALFF values, FC strengths, clinical data, and neuropsychological assessments of patients with UC.   (A)   Disease duration was positively correlated with the two-back reaction time (RT).   (B,C)   The two-back RT was negatively correlated with the decreased ALFF value of the HIPP/ParaHIPP and negatively correlated with increased FC strength between the HIPP/ParaHIPP and CAU.L.   (D,E)   The RT of the Stroop test was positively correlated with the increased ALFF value of the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC.L) and negatively correlated with increased FC strength between the HIPP/ParaHIPP and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).   (F,G)   The alerting effect of the attention network task (ANT) was positively correlated with the ALFF value of the PCC and negatively correlated with increased FC strength between the PCC.L and AUG.L.   (H)   The perceived stress scale (PSS) score was positively correlated with increased FC strength between the PCC.L and middle cingulate cortex (MCC).   (I,J)   The increased FC strength between the MFG.L and IPL.R was negatively correlated with the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) scores. \n  \nAs a supplementary approach, we also extracted brain function signals from the same brain regions in the HC group as in patients displaying changes in brain function and analyzed the correlation between these values and their behavioral data. However, no significant brain-behavior correlations were identified in the HC group. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis rs-fMRI study investigated aberrant brain activity in patients with mildly to moderately active UC and speculated on the neural mechanism underlying their cognitive impairment. In contrast to previous studies, our work not only revealed regional brain activity in the resting state but also analyzed the seed-based whole-brain FC to detect abnormal brain functions in patients with UC. As we predicted, our findings revealed alterations in the limbic system, including the bilateral HIPP/ParaHIPP and left PCC, through the ALFF analysis. In addition, further seed-based FC analyses identified additional aberrantly activated regions that are involved in the default mode network (DMN; Jolles et al.,  ), salience network (SN) and ECN (Ng et al.,  ). Analyses of psychological scales and cognitive function evaluations revealed that both emotional and cognitive functions were impaired in patients with UC compared with HCs. Notably, correlation analyses indicated that abnormal activity in some regions of the brain was related to cognitive function and emotion in patients with UC, and no significant brain-behavior correlations were observed in the HCs. Thus, these correlations appeared only in the UC group. As discussed below, our results illuminate the potential mechanisms underlying cognitive impairments and neuropsychological complications in patients with UC. \n\nThe altered ALFF values in brain regions primarily located in the limbic system were related to the BGA. The gut communicates information to the central nervous system (CNS) through the enteric nervous system (ENS), including the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The CNS responds to and affects intestinal homeostasis by communicating with the ENS, and the BGA plays a crucial role in this communication (Huang et al.,  ). According to the BGA hypothesis, limbic brain regions such as the medial-temporal and cingulate cortices have a direct link to the intrinsic neural network of the gastrointestinal tract (Agostini et al.,  ). Abnormal activity in the BGA can lead not only to increased intestinal inflammation but also to changes in brain function, especially cognitive function. In animal studies, rat forebrain regions including the cortex, hypothalamus, and limbic areas have been suggested to comprise the BGA (Tsurugizawa et al.,  ). Recent fMRI studies revealed abnormalities in the hippocampus or parahippocampal region, amygdala, caudate, and frontal regions in patients with IBD (Agostini et al.,  ), suggesting that these brain areas might contribute to the BGA. In the present study, patients with UC experienced constant intestinal inflammation, and their memory capabilities declined to varying degrees. As the disease duration increased, patient RT in the two-back working memory test increased. The two-back RT also exhibited negatively correlated with subdued ALFF values in HIPP/ParaHIPP, but notably, the FC strength between the HIPP/ParaHIPP and CAU.L increased. The hippocampus plays an important role in the formation of new memories of experienced events, as confirmed by studies using hippocampal cell transplantation in primates (Virley et al.,  ). In addition, the parahippocampal gyrus functions in the encoding and recognition of environmental scenes (M\u00e9gevand et al.,  ). Patients with UC showed decreased HIPP/ParaHIPP activity and longer RT of two-back test, suggesting that their impairments in working memory were associated with decreased HIPP/ParaHIPP activity. The caudate nucleus is involved in the dorsal-prefrontal cortex-subcortical loop, which correlates with deficits in working memory (McHaffie et al.,  ). Functional imaging has revealed activation of this subcortical loop during working memory tasks in primates and healthy human subjects (Hannan et al.,  ). The caudate may also be associated with deficits involving working memory before disease onset. A voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study reported a correlation between the volume of the caudate nucleus and perseverative errors in spatial working memory tasks (Levitt et al.,  ). The amygdala sends direct projections to the caudate nucleus, and both regions have direct and indirect projections to the hippocampus (Postle and D\u2019Esposito,  ). The increased FC strength between the HIPP/ParaHIPP and CAU.L might be a compensatory mechanism of the human brain to reduce the effect of decreased hippocampal activity on working memory. HIPP/ParaHIPP function and FC with CAU.L are postulated to be related to memory deficits in patients with UC. \n\nThe cingulate cortex also plays a central role in the BGA and can be activated by inflammatory stimuli from the gut to affect emotional and cognitive functions in the brain (Elsenbruch et al.,  ). Different regions of the cingulate cortex from neural networks responsible for different functions, including encoding emotions, motivations and cognitive demands (Price,  ; Davis et al.,  ). First, the ACC is primarily responsible for interoceptive processing in the brain (Craig,  ), and a study employing the Stroop test confirmed that the ACC is involved in error detection and conflict monitoring (Bush et al.,  ). In the present study, the FC strength between the HIPP/ParaHIPP and ACC was increased and negatively correlated with RT in the Stroop test. This network might also be a self-preservation mechanism of the brain to counteract impaired executive function. Second, the PCC is highly connected and one of the most metabolically active regions in the brain, having been characterized as a central node in the DMN regulating cognitive and mental function (Andrewshanna et al.,  ). The PCC also participates in the dorsal attention network, which integrates multimodal information and is involved in attentional processes and memory formation (Leech and Sharp,  ). The PCC switches brain activity between introspective functions of the DMN and externally focused functions of the executive network (Menon and Uddin,  ). Previous neuroimaging studies have identified positive PCC activation in IBD patients (Rubio et al.,  ). In our research, the ALFF value of the PCC increased and was positively correlated with the alerting effect of the ANT and RT of the Stroop test. This observation further indicates that the abnormal activity of the PCC results in impaired attention and executive function in patients with UC. Moreover, the FC strength between the PCC.L and AUG.L was increased and negatively correlated with the alerting effect of the ANT. The ANG is also part of the DMN and is associated with attention to visual-spatial features (Seghier,  ). This region plays a decisive role in distinguishing left or right by understanding conceptual \u201cleft\u201d or \u201cright\u201d based on spatial position (Hirnstein et al.,  ). Notably, the ANT task involves determining the right and left directions of the arrow to assess attention in patients with UC. Based on our findings, the ANG plays an important role in the compensatory mechanism of attention processing. When patients with UC show impaired attention, increased FC with the PCC enhances the alerting effect of ANT. Third, the MCC forms extensive connections with the amygdala and participates in the stress and emotional regulation of pain (Vogt,  ). Under stress conditions, aberrantly increased MCC activity might amplify visceral sensitivity in patients with IBD (Agostini et al.,  ). In the present study, the FC between the PCC.L and MCC increased and positively correlated with the PSS score. Thus, the MCC might be the foundation of perceived stress in patients with UC. In summary, the cingulate cortex, which is part of the limbic system, plays an important role in the BGA and affects the executive function and attention of patients with UC. \n\nFinally, the ALFF value of the MFG.L increased and enhanced the FC strength from the MFG.L to the IPL.R and SFG.R. The frontal lobe is associated with emotional modification, receiving input from the limbic system and playing an important part in the storage of emotional memory (Bermpohl et al.,  ). The prefrontal lobe was recently shown to be involved in attention to negative or positive emotions and is always abnormal in patients with IBD (Kerestes et al.,  ). When people participate in negative-based emotion learning, the medial prefrontal gyri and the ACC are strongly activated, and abnormalities in the emotion circuit may lead to symptoms of anxiety and depression (Lin et al.,  ). A resting-state frontal electroencephalograph (EEG) study revealed an association between abnormal asymmetry of frontal lobe electroencephalograph (EEG) and emotion-related disturbances, such as anxiety and depression (Thibodeau et al.,  ). The development of frontal lobe function in children is very important for emotional intelligence (Rosso et al.,  ). In the current study, the SAS and SDS scores of patients with UC were higher than those of the HCs and negatively correlated with increased FC strength from the MFG.L to the IPL.R. We speculate that this increase in FC might be responsible for the susceptibility of patients with UC to developing anxiety and depression. The strength of FC from the MFG.L to the IPL.R may be involved in the emotion circuit of patients with UC. However, further research is needed to confirm this mechanism. \n\nThis work also has several limitations. First, this study found aberrant brain activity in patients with mildly to moderately active UC, but further investigations are needed to determine whether this regional abnormal brain activity is reversible during remission in patients with UC. Second, we sought to eliminate all uncertainties and create a perfect experimental environment; however, some patients who suffered from abdominal discomfort showed poor coordination in the cognitive function evaluation. Finally, social experience, including profession or work-related stress, was another uncontrollable factor that might have contributed to the observations of aberrant brain function. Considering these limitations, the above factors should be considered in subsequent studies, and the changes in brain activity between patients with clinical remission and active UC should be further explored. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, the current study observed dysfunction in the regional and network-level brain functions in patients with mildly to moderately active UC using rs-fMRI. The limbic system, including the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and cingulate cortex, may be considered the center of the BGA, which bidirectionally influences cognitive and gastrointestinal functions. In addition, the DMN and the aberrant FC involving the caudate nucleus, ANG, and MFG may also be a potential neural circuit related to cognitive impairments in patients with UC. These findings provide a better understanding of BGA function, as well as strong neuroimaging evidence of brain dysfunction in patients with UC. \n\n\n## Data Availability \n  \nThe datasets for this manuscript are not publicly available because UC patients\u2019 MRI date the privacy of them and is not available to the public.

As symptom severity may influence brain activity, we investigated whether the severity of MDD affected the accuracies of machine learned MDD-vs-Control diagnostic classifiers. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nForty-five medication-free patients with DSM-IV defined MDD and 19 healthy controls participated in the study. Based on depression severity as determined by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), MDD patients were sorted into three groups: mild to moderate depression (HRSD 14\u201319), severe depression (HRSD 20\u201323), and very severe depression (HRSD \u2265\u00a024). We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data during both resting-state and an emotional-face matching task. Patients in each of the three severity groups were compared against controls in separate analyses, using either the resting-state or task-based fMRI data. We use each of these six datasets with linear support vector machine (SVM) binary classifiers for identifying individuals as patients or controls. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe resting-state fMRI data showed statistically significant classification accuracy only for the   very severe depression   group (accuracy 66%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012 corrected), while   mild to moderate   (accuracy 58%, p\u00a0=\u00a01.0 corrected) and   severe depression   (accuracy 52%, p\u00a0=\u00a01.0 corrected) were only at chance. With task-based fMRI data, the automated classifier performed at chance in all three severity groups. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nBinary linear SVM classifiers achieved significant classification of very severe depression with resting-state fMRI, but the contribution of brain measurements may have limited potential in differentiating patients with less severe depression from healthy controls. \n\n   Highlights  \n  \nSVM binary classifiers achieved significant classification of very severe depression with resting state fMRI data. \n  \nPrefrontal, anterior cingulate and insula were the most discriminative brain regions. \n  \nNo significant classification could be achieved for less severe MDD with resting state data. \n  \nWith emotional task data, SVM classifier performed at chance for all MDD severity groups. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex brain disorder associated with dysregulation of distributed neuronal networks involving several cortical and limbic regions. This position is based on evidence from the neuroimaging literature that has documented distinct structural and functional alterations in patients with MDD compared to healthy controls ( ,  ,  ). However, these group-level inferences have had minimal impact on clinical translation at the individual patient level \u2013 that is, they do not directly lead to a way to determine whether a specific subject has MDD or not. Recently, machine learning techniques have been applied to neuroimaging data to draw inferences for individual subjects, with the potential for improving patient-specific clinical diagnostic and treatment decisions ( ,  ). Current diagnosis of mental disorders is based on diagnostic criteria drawn from self-reported clinical symptoms without any objective biomarkers. This has led to the search, in recent years, for a diagnostic system that can use objective measurements from a subject's brain to validate and improve the accuracy of psychiatric diagnosis. \n\nIn the last decade, several neuroimaging studies have examined the classification accuracy of machine learned classifiers in differentiating patients with MDD from healthy controls. One major focus has been the application of machine learning techniques to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, including both structural and function MRI (fMRI) data. Machine learning is a sub-area of artificial intelligence that applies statistical methods to training data, such as high dimensional neuroimaging data, to find patterns that can distinguish patients from healthy controls. Authors reported classification accuracy for MDD ranging from 67 to 90% using structural MRI data ( ,  ,  ), 94% using resting-state fMRI data ( ,  ), 67\u201386% using task-related fMRI data ( ,  ,  ) and 76.3% using combined structural and functional MRI data ( ). High accuracy prediction is clinically important, as MDD is heterogeneous in symptom profile and prone to clinician bias with poor inter-rater reliability ( ). The identification of MDD subtypes based on neural abnormalities or brain imaging methods might improve classification accuracy, facilitate new drug discovery and move toward stratified medicine. \n\nDepression subtypes defined by symptom severity have several clinical implications for the treatment and prognosis. For example, baseline symptom severity is associated with drug-placebo differences in randomized control trials ( ) and antidepressants are recommended as the choice of treatment for severe depression whereas psychosocial interventions as the choice of treatment for mild-moderate subthreshold depression (NICE guidelines CG90, 2009). Additionally, epidemiological studies have shown the association of symptom severity with functional impairment, co-morbidity and increased risk of mortality ( ,  ,  ). In machine learning approaches, severity-related brain abnormalities have been shown to offer good discriminating potential in the classification of MDD and healthy controls. In emotional task fMRI data,   found significant correlations between the distance of participants' feature vectors from the separating hyperplane of a trained support vector machine, and those participants' severity scores from the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) ( ), which suggests a relationship between depression severity and test predictions ( ). Similarly, another study using structural MRI data reported a strong relationship between the fitted SVM weights and ratings of illness severity ( ). These findings suggest that fitted machine learned classifiers may capture patterns of brain abnormality in functional and structural neuroimaging data related to MDD severity. A model derived from a machine learned classifier may constitute an objective biomarker for depression severity. To date, no previous study has examined how the performance of machine learning algorithms in differentiating MDD vs. health may differ as a function of MDD symptom severity. This research question has important clinical implications in the context of whether machine learning approaches using fMRI data can yield comparable accuracy in the classification of MDD at various levels of severity. \n\nWe examined the accuracy of two-class machine learning classification of three distinct groups of MDD patients, with different levels of symptom severity based on the HRSD Scores, versus healthy controls. The three groups of MDD with severity gradation were: mild to moderate depression (HRSD score 14\u201319), severe depression (HRSD 20\u201323), and very severe depression (HRSD \u2265\u00a024). (While there is no consensus on cutoff scores on the HRSD for identifying MDD severity subtypes, these severity ranges are consistent with several published recommendations ( ,  ,  )). We expected that the classifiers would achieve higher accuracy for the patient groups with very severe depression compared to those with severe depression or mild-moderate depression. For each range of severity, we also considered two types of fMRI data \u2013 from either resting-state or from an emotional-face matching task \u2013 hence, we examined classifier performance for 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 different situations. \n\n\n## Materials & methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nEthics approval was obtained from the local review board. All participants were fluent in English and gave informed, written consent to participate in the study. Forty-five patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD ( ) according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis 1 Disorders ( ), were recruited through advertisements. (See   for participant demographics). Patients included 29 females and 16 males, all right-handed, in the age range of 19\u201358\u00a0years (mean 37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011 SD). The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory was used to assess handedness ( ). The severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms was assessed using the clinician-administered, 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( ), the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) ( ), and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) ( ). Patients were also rated for disease severity using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale ( ), which allows clinicians to provide a severity rating based on their clinical experience. Patients were included in the study if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) acute episode of MDD of unipolar subtype and a score of 14 or higher on the HRSD, and (2) free of psychotropic medication for a minimum of three weeks at time of recruitment. Exclusion criteria were: (1) Axis I disorders such as bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, or psychosis, (2) history of substance abuse within six months of study participation, (3) borderline personality disorder, (4) medical or neurological disorders, (5) severe suicidal symptoms, (6) failure to respond to three trials of antidepressant medication, or (7) contraindications for MRI (metal implants, pregnancy, etc.). Patients were divided into three MDD severity groups based their HRSD scores. The mild-moderate group (HRSD 14\u201319) included 12 patients. The severe group (HRSD 20\u201323) included 18 patients. The very severe group (HRSD 24\u00a0+) included 15 patients. \n\nNineteen healthy controls, matched for gender (11 females, 8 males) and age (20\u201352\u00a0years, mean 33 +/ 10 SD), were also recruited for the study through advertisements. These participants were screened using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM\u2013IV Axis I Disorders, non-patient version, to ensure they did not have previous or current Axis I psychiatric disorders ( ) nor any family history of Axis I disorders, as determined by self-report. The control's HRSD scores ranged from 0 to 7. The demographics of the MDD patients and healthy controls are summarized in  . \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nMR images were collected using a 3 Tesla General Electric MR scanner (Signa VHi; General Electric Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) equipped with an eight-channel, phased-array head coil. For each participant, two resting-state fMRI scans of 220\u00a0s in duration were acquired using a single-shot gradient-recalled echo, echo planar imaging sequence (110 volumes, repeat time (TR) 2000\u00a0ms, echo time (TE) 30\u00a0ms, flip angle 65\u00b0, field of view (FOV) 240\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240\u00a0mm squared, matrix size 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064, in-plane resolution 3.75\u00a0mm, 30 axial slices, 4\u00a0mm slice thickness). For the resting-state collection, participants were required to remain in the MRI scanner with their eyes open and fixated on a black crosshair at the center of a projection screen. The participants were instructed to relax, not think about anything in particular, and not to fall asleep. In addition, four emotional face task fMRI scans were collected per scanning session (for each subject), lasting 300\u00a0s each (150 volumes, TR 2000\u00a0ms, TE 30\u00a0ms, flip angle 65\u00b0, FOV 240\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240 mm squared, matrix size 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064, in-plane resolution 3.75\u00a0mm, 30 axial slices, slice thickness 4\u00a0mm). A T1-weighted structural MRI (TR 9.2\u00a0ms, TE minimum, flip angle 20\u00b0, FOV 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256 mm squared, matrix size 512\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0512, in-plane resolution 0.5\u00a0mm, 176 sagittal slices, slice thickness 1\u00a0mm) was also acquired for anatomical registration of the fMRI data. \n\n\n### fMRI emotional-face matching task paradigm \n  \nWhile undergoing fMRI brain imaging, participants viewed triads either of faces or of control geometrical designs during a series of trials ( ). Each face had one of four emotional expressions: angry, fearful, happy, or sad. For each face triad, participants used a button box to indicate which of two target faces depicted the same emotion as the source face. Similarly, for control condition, participants responded with button press to indicate which of two geometrical designs matched with source geometrical design. Each fMRI run included 60 trials (12 for each of the four assessed emotions and the control condition). The order of presentation was randomized and each individual trial lasted 5\u00a0s (images: 3\u00a0s; inter-trial interval: 2\u00a0s). Stimulus onset asynchrony between successive trials was jittered (5\u00a0s or more in random increments of 0.5\u00a0s) to preserve fMRI signal variance ( ). Previous work has shown that this emotional face matching task compared to control condition engages affective processing mechanisms, and reliably activates the amygdala and other relevant prefrontal and cingulate regions ( ). \n\n\n### Pre-processing \n  \nWe considered two fMRI datasets, each involving all of the subjects, both control and MDD: one for resting-state, and another for the emotional face task. Each dataset was preprocessed using SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) and in-house code written in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). The preprocessing steps for fMRI data included: (1) 6 parameter rigid body motion correction of fMRI volumes in SPM8, (2) non-linear spatial warping to MNI EPI template at 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0mm cubed resolution (43\u00a0\u00d7\u00a051\u00a0\u00d7\u00a037 voxels grid) in SPM8, and (3) 8\u00a0mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian spatial smoothing of fMRI volumes in SPM8. The pre-processed registered fMRI data were masked to exclude voxels outside the brain using a hand-built mask. This mask retained 26,904 voxels (1,513,406\u00a0mm ) out of the 81,141 voxels in the interpolated fMRI volume space. \n\n\n### Dataset notation \n  \nTo facilitate description of our analysis, we define a simple notation. We performed six analyses, using resting-state fMRI data or emotional face task fMRI data from one of the three patient severity groups (mild-moderate MDD, severe MDD, and very-severe MDD) as well as controls. We will use the phrase \u201cdataset S\u201d to refer to the dataset used in a given analysis. Therefore, dataset S consisted of either resting-state or emotional face task fMRI data from the patients in a given severity group as well as controls. \n\n\n### Overview of machine learning approach \n  \nWe ran six analyses, each testing the ability of machine learning to produce classifiers that could effectively differentiate between healthy controls and MDD patients from one of the three MDD severity groups, using either resting-state fMRI or emotional face task fMRI data. For each, we ran the LearnFMRI process, which selected one out of five different feature extraction algorithms as well as the regularization parameter value for the linear SVM learning algorithm (all described below). LearnFMRI then ran this particular choice of algorithm and regularization parameter value on all of the training data to produce a classifier, which could then be used to diagnose a future subject; see  . \n\nWe now provide a detailed explanation of the LearnFMRI procedure. To reduce the dimensionality of the fMRI data, our LearnFMRI system selects one of five different feature extraction algorithms for each of the 6 datasets S (each hand-coded in MATLAB): (1) independent components analysis (ICA) whole brain map feature extraction, ICA-Whole-FE; (2) ICA significant cluster feature extraction, ICA-Clust-FE; (3) pair-wise correlation feature extraction, PairCor-FE; (4) general linear model (GLM) analysis whole brain map feature extraction, GLM-Whole-FE; and (5) GLM significant cluster feature extraction, GLM-Clust-FE. (LearnFMRI considered only ICA-Whole-FE, ICA-Clust-FE and PairCor-FE for resting-state fMRI data, and all five for task-based datasets.) Feature extraction algorithms ICA-Clust-FE and GLM-Clust-FE used statistical testing between patients and controls to extract features (voxel clusters) that were significantly different between the groups. To reduce the potential for overfitting, it performed statistical comparisons only between patients and controls in training sets (see   section below). Therefore, different sets of participants (i.e. only the training set participants) contributed to these statistical tests in different folds of the nested cross-validation described below. Statistical maps differed between folds. These differences are illustrated in  . The ICA-Whole-FE, PairCor-FE and GLM-Whole-FE algorithms did not use statistical testing between patients and controls to generate features. Details of feature extraction algorithms are provided below. \n\nFor each task, LearnFMRI also tested the linear support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm with regularization parameter values 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 10.0 and selected the best-performing parameter value. \n\nTesting multiple combinations of feature extraction and classifier algorithms on the test data and then presenting only the algorithms that perform best on that data may create a substantial danger of   overfitting  , where an algorithm works well because it is matching the specific pattern of noise that happens to be present in the dataset tested. This good performance does not generalize to new data with different noise patterns. (Note that this overfitting is in terms of the   choice   of algorithm; this is still a problem even when cross-validation is used to protect against overfitting in terms of the algorithms' learned weight values.) LearnFMRI therefore used internal cross-validation to protect against overfitting with respect to (1) the choice of feature extraction algorithm, (2) the extracted features (feature extraction used the patient/control labels), (3) the choice of regularization parameter value for the linear SVM learning algorithm and (4) the weights chosen by the linear SVM learning algorithm. \n\nOur LearnFMRI system is summarized in  . Given the set of labeled training data for each dataset S, LearnFMRI considers each combination of feature extractor and regularization parameter and returns the best-performing choice of feature extraction algorithm as well as a linear SVM classifier trained using the best regularization parameter value. To estimate the generalization performance of the chosen feature extraction algorithm and trained linear SVM classifier, we used a five-fold cross-validation process, repeated ten times, with different random partitioning of participants into the five folds. Note that different cross-validation folds found different best combinations of feature extraction/regularization parameter. This cross-validation process estimates the accuracy not of a single machine learned classifier but of the entire process of selecting the feature extraction algorithm and regularization parameter value and training the linear SVM classifier. \n\n\n### Feature extraction preliminaries \u2013 cluster growing algorithm \n  \nThe ICA-Clust-FE and GLM-Clust-FE feature extraction algorithms each identify significant clusters in statistical parametric maps (details provided below). Each uses the following automated region-growing algorithm to identify clusters: Given a 3D statistical parametric map, (t-map generated by comparing patients vs. controls in terms of ICA maps values or GLM beta weight values), the cluster-growing algorithm grows a cluster around each positive or negative statistical peak (local extremum) in the map. Specifically, it uses each peak voxel as a seed of the cluster, and then adds neighboring, statistically significant voxels to the growing cluster one-at-a-time, until the algorithm encounters either non-significant neighbor voxels or significant voxels that have already been added to another growing cluster. If two statistical peaks are too close together (within 10\u00a0mm of each other), the less-significant peak is not used as a cluster seed. This prevents large \u201chills\u201d of significant voxels that happen to have two or more peaks that are close together from being divided into multiple smaller clusters. \n\n\n### Independent components analysis (ICA) feature extraction \u2013 ICA-Whole-FE, ICA-Clust-FE \n  \nOur ICA feature extraction algorithms, ICA-Whole-FE and ICA-Clust-FE, are both based on the ICA procedure of  . Briefly, 15 ICA \u201cconnectivity maps\u201d are computed. ICA-Whole-FE simply combines a given participant's ICA map values into one long feature vector for that participant. ICA-Clust-FE extracts significant voxel clusters by comparing patients vs. controls for each of the 15 ICA maps. Note that ICA-Whole-FE does not use the participant labels (patient or control), whereas ICA-Clust-FE does use the labels. We applied ICA-Whole-FE or ICA-Clust-FE to resting-state or task-based fMRI data separately. Details of the algorithms are provided in Appendix A. \n\n\n### Pair-wise correlation feature extraction \u2013 PairCor-FE \n  \nThe Harvard-Oxford atlas includes 26 prefrontal regions involved in executive control and/or emotion regulation (see  ); Previous literature suggest that changes in these regions have been associated with major depressive disorder ( ). PairCor-FE defined each participant's feature vector as the 325 pair-wise correlations among those regions' time courses, and al computed these correlation features separately for either the resting-state or task-based fMRI data, as follows. All fMRI data runs for the participant were concatenated along the time axis (two runs for resting-state data, four runs for task-based data). The mean fMRI activation time course was computed for each region (mean across voxels in the region). The Pearson correlation coefficient was computed for each pair of time courses among all 325 pairs of different regions; this 325-tuple of correlation values was the feature vector for the participant, which were used by the classifier; see the   section below. \n\n\n### GLM analysis feature extraction for task-based data \u2013 GLM-Whole-FE, GLM-Clust-FE \n  \nThe GLM-Whole-FE and GLM-Clust-FE feature extraction algorithms were used with emotional-face task fMRI data only. Both involve the standard General Linear Model (GLM) analysis, based on the following statistical contrasts:   \nlocalizer contrast (sum of all five trial types), \n  \nemotional faces - geometric stimuli, \n  \npositive - negative emotional faces (happy - other emotional faces), and \n  \nnegative faces - geometric stimuli (where negative faces included angry, fearful, and sad faces). \n  \n\nGLM-Whole-FE combines the four (first-level) contrast maps for a given participant into one long feature vector for that participant. GLM-Clust-FE compares contrast maps in terms of patients vs. controls and extracts significant clusters for each map. See Appendix B for details. \n\n\n### Base-learner: linear SVM \n  \nOur LearnFMRI learning algorithm uses the linear support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm to create trained linear SVM classifiers. We used the LIBSVM implementation of the linear SVM learning algorithm and classifier, along with in-house MATLAB code for all data manipulation, cross-validation book-keeping, and accuracy computations. \n\n\n### Machine learning algorithm \u2013 LearnFMRI \n  \nGiven a labeled training dataset, LearnFMRI will produce a classifier that can accurately classify novel participants. As shown in  , LearnFMRI first selects one feature extraction algorithm (which is one of ICA-Whole-FE, ICA-Clust-FE, PairCor-FE, GLM-Whole-FE or GLM-Clust-FE) as well as the linear SVM regularization parameter   C  \u00a0\u2208\u00a0{0.1,\u00a00.3,\u00a01.0,\u00a03.0,\u00a010.0}. LearnFMRI uses an internal cross-validation to find the appropriate feature selection and regularization parameter; see  . This involves trying each specific feature selector and regularization parameter on a portion of the training data and evaluating the performance on the remaining subset. (This is repeated four times; see \u201cIllustration\u201d section below.) After finding the best choice of feature selector and regularization parameter, LearnFMRI then uses these \u201csettings\u201d to train the classifier, using all of the training data. It then returns that resulting trained classifier. \n\n\n### Classifier performance \n  \nFor each dataset S, our goal is a single classifier (SVM*) that can accurately diagnose novel participants \u2013 that is, participants who were not in the training set. To estimate the expected out-of-sample (generalization) accuracy of this classifier SVM* \u2013 the result of running LearnFMRI on all of the training data from a given dataset S \u2013 we used five-fold cross-validation; see  . For each of the five folds, approximately one fifth of the participants was held out as a test set, with the remaining four-fifths comprising the training set. Test and training sets were balanced as closely as possible for proportions of patients versus controls. Five-fold cross-validation was repeated ten times with different random assignments of participants to the five folds. Note that this cross-validation ran the entire LearnFMRI learning algorithm for each fold, which in turn used internal cross-validation steps inside it \u2013 i.e. nested cross-validation inside the outer five-fold cross validation. The use of nested cross-validation was important for protecting against overfitting in the selection of the feature extraction algorithm, cluster selection from statistical testing (patients vs. controls), and choice of regularization parameter for the linear SVM base-learner. \n\nWe quantified the performance of these classifiers using multiple measures: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value (all measures were based on cross-validation). As described above, there were six analyses: mild-moderate MDD (respectively, severe MDD or very severe MDD) patients vs. controls, using either resting-state or task-based fMRI data. For each of these analyses, each of the participants used in that analysis was present in the (outer) test set in precisely one iteration of outer cross-validation, on each of the ten repetitions (see above). Thus, each participant's data underwent ten classification attempts. For each participant, we computed the proportion of correct classification attempts. Accuracy was computed as the mean proportion of correct classification attempts across all participants. Sensitivity was computed as the mean proportion of correct classification attempts for patients (true positives), and specificity was computed as the mean proportion of correct classification attempts for controls (true negatives). Balanced accuracy was computed as the mean of sensitivity and specificity. Positive predictive value (and negative predictive value, respectively) was computed as the proportion correct among positive (respectively, negative) predictions. \n\nFor each of the six analyses, mean accuracy values were compared against chance accuracy using one-tailed bootstrap statistical tests on participants' proportion of correct classification attempts values. Chance accuracy was derived from randomly guessing the participant class (patient/control) weighted by the relative proportions of patients and controls in the given analysis. Specifically, let r\u00a0=\u00a0proportion of patients\u00a0=\u00a0#patients\u00a0/\u00a0(#patients\u00a0+\u00a0#controls), which is in the range [0,1]. Then random accuracy\u00a0=\u00a0r \u00a0+\u00a0(1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0r) , which is in the range [0,1]. Chance accuracy values ranged from 50 to 53% depending on the numbers of patients and controls used in each analysis. The alpha-value (false positive rate under the null hypothesis of chance accuracy) was set a 0.05. Multiple comparison correction was performed using the Bonferroni method (i.e. multiplying the individual p-values by the number of tests; 6 in this case). \n\n\n### Illustration of the overall learning\u00a0+\u00a0evaluation process \n  \nWe provide a detailed illustration, for a given run of five-fold cross-validation (i.e. set of all five iterations of five-fold cross-validation). See  . Here, we first divided the participants into five folds, approximately balanced for proportion of patients and controls. On the i-th iteration of outer cross-validation, we held out the i-th fold as the test set (i.e. outer test set). All participants not in fold i were used as the training set for that iteration (i.e. outer training set input to the learning algorithm LearnFMRI). LearnFMRI then computed accuracy scores for each combination of feature extraction algorithm and regularization parameter. To do so, the learning algorithm employed a four-fold cross validation (inner cross-validation) analysis for each possible combination. For a given combination, on the j-th iteration of inner cross-validation, we held out the j-th fold as the inner test set. All participants not in folds j or i were used as the inner training set for that inner iteration. Statistical comparisons between patients and controls during feature extraction were performed only on participants from the inner training set. The resulting statistical differences were used to extract features for the inner test set participants without using those participants' labels (patient versus control). The classifier was trained on the inner training participants (those not in either fold j or i) and tested on the inner test participants (in fold j). Accuracy results were averaged over the four inner cross-validation folds. In this way, (inner) cross-validated accuracy scores were computed for each combination of feature extraction and regularization parameter. LearnFMRI then chose the best combination, defined as that combination yielding the highest accuracy (proportion of correctly classified participants) over the four-fold inner cross-validation tests. That best combination specified the feature extraction algorithm and regularization parameter, which were then applied to all the participants in the outer training set (i.e. all participants not in fold i), resulting in a trained linear SVM classifier. The choice of feature extraction method and the trained classifier are the output of the learning algorithm. Their performance was then tested on participants in the outer test set (i.e. participants in fold i). \n\n\n### Visualization of machine learning analysis \n  \nTo gain insight into the automated diagnosis process, we analyzed the classifier weights for various fMRI-based features. The linear SVM learning algorithm produces a \u201cweight\u201d for each feature, which recall corresponds to a value extracted from one voxel or region or the correlations between two regions (see descriptions of feature extraction algorithms above). The weights for this classifier are presented in the   section of the Results. \n\nTo visualize which brain regions a classifier used, we created a weight map by weighting each relevant region by the absolute value of its appropriate weight value. We did this only for the analysis of patients with very-severe MDD vs. controls using resting-state fMRI data, as this was the only analysis that performed significantly above chance. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographics \n  \nThere were no significant differences between healthy controls and MDD patients in sex or age ( ). There were no significant differences among the three patient groups (mild-moderate MDD, severe MDD, and very-severe MDD) in terms of sex, age, age of MDD onset, illness duration, or duration of current MDD episode ( ). As expected, there were group differences in HRSD scores between patients and controls and among the three patient groups. There were also significant differences in MADRS scores, HAM-A scores, CGI scores among the three patient groups, which is consistent with severity categories defined by HRSD scores. \n\n\n### Classification results \n  \nBased on ten repetitions of five-fold cross-validation, classification using resting-state fMRI data comparing MDD patients with very severe depression vs. controls achieved a sensitivity of 59%, specificity of 72% and accuracy of 66% ( ). This accuracy value was significantly above chance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.012, Bonferroni corrected for the 6 tests). Classification analyses using resting-state fMRI data with patients in the mild-moderate and severe depression groups did not achieve accuracies significantly above chance ( ). Interestingly, accuracies were not significantly above chance for classification using the emotional face task fMRI data for any of the three patient groups ( ). \n\n\n### Discriminating brain regions \n  \nWe applied LearnFMRI to resting-state fMRI data from all patients with very-severe MDD and healthy controls to derive one model. In this case, the learning algorithm selected pair-wise correlation feature extraction and the SVM regularization parameter value of C\u00a0=\u00a00.1. The regions considered for pair-wise correlation features come from the Harvard-Oxford atlas and are listed in  .   shows these regions, colour-coded based on the learned classifier weights and superimposed on one participant's anatomical scan.   shows the learned weights from the trained linear SVM classifier for all 325 pair-wise correlation features from the analysis of very severe depression vs. healthy controls using resting-state fMRI data. (There are subtleties in interpreting weight values from trained classifiers. See   for discussion. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we evaluated the performance of two-class automated classification (healthy controls vs. patients) for three groups of patients with MDD: mild-moderate MDD, severe MDD, and very-severe MDD. The main finding is that using pattern analysis of resting-state fMRI activity, the accuracy of learned classifier was significantly better than chance at classifying very severe depression versus healthy controls. However, the performance of the classifiers for distinguishing healthy versus mild-moderate depression and healthy versus severe depression, were only at the chance level. Another important finding is that fMRI activation patterns evoked by the emotional face processing task failed to show significant classification performance, for any of the MDD severity groups. Given the small sample size, our results should be considered as preliminary. \n\nThe finding of higher classification accuracy for very severe depression is consistent with previous machine learning studies that showed significant correlations between prediction scores and symptom severity scores using structural and functional data. The classification accuracy of 66% for very severe depression is comparable to that of previous studies using working memory neural correlates and structural data ( ,  ). However, contrary to our results, those previous studies, using similar supervised SVM learners, could significantly distinguish controls from MDD with moderate severity (mean HRSD: 21\u201322) ( ,  ,  ). The inconsistencies in results could be partly explained by variations in methodology and MRI data, as we used resting-state fMRI data whereas those previous studies used structural MRI and emotional recognition task-dependent fMRI data. Given the lower accuracies for the classification of less severe depression groups, our results suggest that less severe forms of MDD may be heterogeneous and is likely to capture mild forms of depressive states such as dysthymia and anxiety or personality weighted conditions. As less severe forms of depression may be associated with mild brain abnormalities, it might be harder for the learning algorithm to find a meaningful boundary between these groups and controls in a small dataset. We may need larger sample to improve the power and enable the classifiers to distinguish these groups from healthy controls. Considering that the need for machine learning methods in the diagnosis of milder depression would be greater in clinical practice than that of more severe form of depression, the poor accuracy in the classification of milder depression by machine learning methods shown in this study may limit its use as a tool in the early detection of milder or subthreshold depression. However, results based on small sample size precludes any conclusions on clinical utility. In addition, although our current classifier yielded significant classification for very severe depression, the clinical utility of this current system may be limited by its modest specificity (72%). Again, this needs to be tested in larger and independent samples. \n\nThe brain regions that contributed to the classification of very severe depression included the various prefrontal and limbic regions listed in  . These regions have been reported to have abnormal structure and function in group-level analyses between patients with MDD and healthy control ( ,  ,  ). Moreover, the resting-state functional connectivity between prefrontal, insula and anterior cingulate regions was found to be positively correlated with severity of depression in univariate analysis ( ,  ), which is consistent with our findings, and suggests the greater contribution of these networks in the classification of very severe depression from healthy controls. \n\nAlthough previous fMRI studies using univariate analysis showed significant correlation between severity of depressive symptoms and alteration in regional brain activity due to emotional tasks or stimuli, our results failed to show significant accuracy in distinguishing healthy controls from depression patients, grouped at three levels of severity. Of course, this may be due to the different objectives, as univariate correlations (at the class level) are neither sufficient nor necessary for effective classification performance. In addition, this behavior could be due to low reliability of the task or poor variance of task-related activation between the three depression groups and the control group. Alternatively, this may be due to the small sample sizes here, coupled with the complexity of the emotional task. Although this is the first study to use an emotional-face matching task in fMRI machine learning analysis, several studies used this paradigm to elicit responses in neural regions and circuits implicated in emotional processing ( ,  ). Previously published fMRI machine learning studies ( ,  ) used an emotional face recognition task that is more cognitively/perceptually demanding than the emotional face matching task used here. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the pattern of resting-state fMRI BOLD signals produced better classification of severe MDD than the fMRI patterns evoked by the emotional face matching task. \n\nThe reasons for the better performance of the classifier using resting-state data than task related data remains speculative and could be related to the abnormalities of the default mode network (DMN) in MDD. DMN refers to spontaneously organized brain activities from a network of brain regions including anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and inferior parietal lobule ( ), which is activated during rest and deactivated during active tasks ( ). Previous studies of MDD showed increased resting-state functional connectivity of the DMN areas especially in anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal regions ( ) and decreased functional connectivity in bilateral prefrontal areas of DMN during emotional processing tasks ( ). Furthermore, higher levels of rumination about depressive symptoms was found to be correlated with higher DMN dominance ( ) and severe depressive symptoms ( ). It is therefore possible that the increased levels of rumination and associated increased DMN activity during the resting stage may have contributed for the greater performance of the classifier for very severe depression, whereas the lack of activation in DMN due to reduction in rumination during the engagement with the task may partly explain the poor performance of the classifier with task related data. \n\n### Methodological issues \n  \nAs mentioned above, a major limitation of the study is the small sample size, which might have influenced our results. Although previous machine learning studies in MDD achieved higher accuracies using small datasets ( ,  ,  ), yet larger studies in two independent samples are needed to develop and test predictive models that are sufficiently stable to use in clinical practice. Recent machine learning studies using structural MRI have recommended participant groups with 130 participants or more per group to learn an effective classification for schizophrenia versus healthy controls ( ). However, there are no clear guidelines on required sample sizes for machine learning studies using resting and task-related fMRI data in patients with MDD. Additionally, owing to our unbalanced sample between MDD (N\u00a0=\u00a045) and healthy controls (N\u00a0=\u00a019), we did not examine the accuracy of classification of MDD as a single group vs. healthy controls. Another major methodological issue is the categorization of MDD severity groups based on HDRS scores. As mentioned previously, there is no consensus on the validity of cutoffs on HDRS for defining the severity categories. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) Handbook of Psychiatric Measures recommended the following thresholds to define grades of severity on HRSD: mild to moderate \u2264\u00a018, severe 19\u201322, very severe \u2265\u00a023 ( ). In contrast, others have used 20 as the cutoff to distinguish severe depression from mild to moderate ( ) and 24 or 25 as the cutoff to distinguish severe from very-severe depression ( ,  ). As there is very limited empirical research in this area, we used other severity measures such as MADRS and CGI scores to corroborate the severity categories defined by HDRS (see  ). A third potential issue is that we used linear SVM classifiers. We focused on this algorithm because it offers the advantage that one can examine the learned weights and attempt to interpret how the classifier is using the input features to produce a classification prediction. It is possible that other machine learning classifiers such as the non-linear radial basis function (RBF) SVM will yield better accuracy in this context. Unfortunately, it is difficult to provide a simple, straightforward interpretation of how algorithms such as RBF SVM produce predictions for a given individual. This difficulty of interpretation presents a barrier to deployment in the clinic, as medical practitioners place a high degree of importance on being able to interpret and evaluate the predictions of any automated clinical decision-making system. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nResting-state brain activity provides a statistically significant classification of healthy controls vs. patients with very severe MDD (HRSD scores \u2265\u00a024) but not for less severe depression. Moreover, even the classification accuracy that our approach achieved for very severe MDD is not sufficient from a clinical perspective. The negative results of our study help to focus the future efforts of our community, on considering larger sample sizes. We anticipate this may lead to better results that may provide clinically meaningful classification results for MDD based on severity. \n\nThe following are the supplementary data related to this article. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: t0005\n### Label: Table 1\nCharacteristic\tAll MDD patients\tMild-moderate MDD\tSevere MDD\tVery severe MDD\tHealthy controls\tp-Value (patients vs. controls)\tp-Value (3 MDD groups omnibus comparison)\nn\t45\t12\t18\t15\t19\t\t\nSex (% female)\t64%\t42%\t67%\t80%\t58%\t0.31\t0.09\nAge (years)\t37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\t33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\t38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\t37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\t33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\t0.18\t0.39\nAge of onset (years)\t24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\t19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\t26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\t27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\t\u2013\t\u2013\t0.10\nIllness duration (years)\t12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\t14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\t13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\t10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\t\u2013\t\u2013\t0.50\nDuration of current episode (months)\t59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a066\t42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a054\t72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a073\t57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a069\t\u2013\t\u2013\t0.48\nHRSD score\t22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\t17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\t21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\t26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\t3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\t10\u2212\u00a027\t10\u2212\u00a015\nHAM-A score\t24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\t19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\t24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\t27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\t\u2013\t\u2013\t10\u2212\u00a06\nCGI score\t4.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\t3.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\t4.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\t5.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\t\u2013\t\u2013\t0.001\nMADRS scores\t26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\t20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\t25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\t31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\t\t\t0.001\n### Caption\nCharacteristics of three MDD patient groups and healthy controls.\n### Footer\nAge, Age of onset, Illness duration, Duration of current episode, HRSD score, HAM-A score, and CGI score rows show mean values\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviations.

However, among vulnerable adolescents, peer evaluation can be detrimental, contributing to affective disorders. It is, therefore, critical to improve our understanding of neural underpinnings of peer evaluation. Prior research has investigated averaged neural responses to peer acceptance or rejection, neglecting to probe trial-by-trial computations that mirror real-time updating of daily activities. In non-social decision-making, a common neural valuation system centered on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has emerged, which evaluates different reward types on a common scale to guide choices. However, it is unclear whether the mPFC also tracks complex social scenarios involving peer feedback. To address this gap, we acquired fMRI data from 55 healthy adolescents during the Chatroom Task, which probes peer evaluation, and implemented a computational approach to characterize trial-by-trial social value, thereby allowing us to interrogate the neural correlates of social value. Consistent with our hypothesis, social value signals were encoded in the mPFC. Interestingly, analyses also revealed a wider social-specific valuation network including the precuneus and amygdala. Understanding how adolescents make social decisions and neural markers associated with it, may, ultimately, help us clarify promising targets for intervention. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAdolescence is characterized by greater reliance on peer relationships and more autonomy from parents ( ). Although this is developmentally normative, the increased exposure to peer rejection, for some, may lead to the onset of mental disorders (including depression) and an increased risk of suicidal behaviors ( ;  ). Adolescence also is a critical period for brain development ( ), and thus, understanding the neural mechanisms that characterize social processes\u2014particularly when adolescents are accepted or rejected by peers\u2014may elucidate potential targets to guide future preventative interventions. \n\nA widely used experimental paradigm to probe neural correlates of peer evaluation is the Chatroom Task ( ;  ;  ). This ecologically valid task delivers peer feedback (i.e. acceptance versus rejection) within a simulated social context. Neuroimaging studies using this task have identified a wide network of brain regions engaged during processing of peer feedback that are relevant to depression and anxiety disorders, including the striatum, insula, amygdala and medial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC;  ;  ;  ). Specifically, among healthy adolescents, the striatum, thalamus and VLPFC were recruited more strongly during peer acceptance compared to rejection, whereas the amygdala, mPFC and insula were more strongly recruited during peer rejection relative to acceptance ( ;  ). Interestingly, relative to healthy adolescents, anxious and depressed adolescents showed increased amygdala, insula and mPFC activation, and mPFC\u2013amygdala coupling during peer rejection ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nAlthough these studies have provided important insights, these analyses have relied on averaged neural responses to peer acceptance and rejection across trials, neglecting to probe critical trial-by-trial computations. A trial-level approach is important and can potentially provide more fine-grained information that sheds light on computational processes relevant to affective disorders. This is critical as, in daily life, we continuously update our preferences based on expected and unexpected outcomes. For example, if a peer acts in an untoward way, the reflexive response would be to update the value of this peer (e.g. act in a more cautious manner during the subsequent encounter). In this context, social processing involves continuously updating the value associated with social stimuli based on the discrepancy between the expected and predicted social outcomes (e.g. whether or not the person you expected to like reciprocated your feelings). As the Chatroom Task reliably probes brain regions involved with social computation, there is an opportunity to elucidate regions implicated in this social valuation process. \n\nDuring this task, participants initially select same-aged peers to chat with later in the study (i.e.   Initial Value  ). After a brief delay typically spanning 1\u20132\u00a0weeks, participants rate their expectation of peers\u2019 interest in chatting with them (i.e.   Expected Value  ) and later receive explicit feedback from peers\u2014they are either accepted or rejected\u2014and then rate their subjective feeling after receiving the outcome (i.e.   Social Outcome  ). We expected that the discrepancy between the   Expected Value   and   Social Outcome   would lead to a social prediction error, which may then be used to update their   Initial Value   of the peer to obtain an updated   Social Value   for this peer. Utilizing this computational framework allows the computation of an individual\u2019s social value on a trial-by-trial basis after every outcome and the identification of brain regions that compute and encode this value. This may, ultimately, improve our understanding of social processes in the context of peer evaluation. \n\nIt has been proposed that social decisions may draw on a similar reinforcement learning framework as utilized during non-social decision making ( ). In this context, it has been proposed that a common neural valuation network exists ( ;  ), which evaluates different reward types on a common scale to guide choices ( ;  ). The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) forms the core of this network and is consistently shown to encode subjective value for different types of simple social (e.g. smile, praise) and non-social rewards [e.g. money, juice ( ;  )]. However, real-life social scenarios involve the integration of many potentially rewarding and aversive stimuli, and it is unclear whether there is a common neural valuation system that tracks these complex social scenarios (e.g. peer feedback). To address this gap, the study objective was to interrogate the neural correlates of social value during the Chatroom Task in healthy adolescents using a computational approach, involving trial-by-trial modulation of social value. Building on prior studies ( ;  ), we hypothesized that the mPFC would encode social value across healthy adolescents during the Chatroom Task. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSeventy healthy adolescents (45 females, 25 males) aged 12\u201314\u00a0years were recruited from the greater Boston area through online advertisements, posted flyers and direct mailings. Inclusion criteria included English fluency and right-handedness. Exclusion criteria included lifetime diagnosis of any psychopathology, mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, head injury resulting in loss of consciousness for 5\u00a0min or seizures. After exclusion due to motion and other structural abnormalities (see  ), the final sample considered for analyses included 55 adolescents (38 females, 17 males; age: 13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.82). \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nThe Partners Institutional Review Board provided approval for the study. Adolescents assented, and a legal guardian provided informed written consent. Procedures were completed over two laboratory visits. In the first visit, adolescents were administered a diagnostic interview using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS-PL;  ). K-SADS is a semi-structured interview assessing lifetime DSM-IV disorders in youth. In addition, participants completed the Phase 1 of the Chatroom Task. During the second visit, which occurred within 1\u20132\u00a0weeks (mean\u2009=\u20098.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.9\u00a0days), participants completed Phase 2 of the Chatroom Task outside of the scanner, and Phase 3 was completed while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired. High-resolution structural MRI data also were also acquired to aid registration of functional images to MNI space. Participants were remunerated $80 ($40 for Day 1 and $40 for Day 2) for their participation. \n\n\n### Chatroom task \n  \nThe Chatroom Task ( ,  ;  ) was designed to simulate differential response to peer feedback (i.e. acceptance versus rejection). E-Prime (Psychological Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA) software was used to present stimuli and record responses. This task was divided into three phases. In Phase 1, participants were led to believe they were participating in a nationwide study of how adolescents interact in online chatrooms. First, they created an online profile (i.e. indicating likes and dislikes) and then photographs of the participants were taken. Next, they viewed photographs of 60 same-aged female/male adolescents (corresponding to the gender of the participant) and selected 30 adolescents they were \u2018interested\u2019 and 30 adolescents they were \u2018not interested\u2019 in chatting with online following a neuroimaging scan 1\u20132\u00a0weeks later [Note: this was a categorical decision between not interested and interested options]. Participants were informed that female/male peers (corresponding to the gender of the participant) from collaborating institutions would review their profiles and indicate whether they were interested (i.e. peer acceptance) or not interested (i.e. peer rejection) in chatting online. Participants viewed pictures but not profiles of other adolescents. Photographs were equated on contrast and luminescence. Approximately 70% of photos were Caucasian and 30% were not Caucasian (i.e. Black, Hispanic, Asian, Mixed Race). Participants rated each photograph once. \n  \nTask design of Chatroom Task, showing Phases 1, 2 and 3\u2014Phases 1 and 2 took place outside the scanner, whereas Phase 3 occurred during the fMRI acquisition. \n  \nPhase 2 and 3 occurred 1\u20132\u00a0weeks after completing Phase 1. For Phase 2, participants were shown the photographs they previously classified as \u2018interested\u2019 and \u2018not interested\u2019 and asked to rate, \u2018How interested do you think s/he is in you?\u2019 on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (not very interested) to 100 (very interested) prior to the fMRI acquisition. Phase 3 of the Chatroom Task was completed in the scanner, during which participants received peer feedback from the 60 female/male adolescents allegedly participating in the nationwide study while fMRI data were acquired. During each trial ( ), a participant viewed the photograph of a \u2018participating female/male adolescent\u2019 (1300\u00a0ms), and a photograph caption displaying \u2018interested\u2019 or \u2018not interested\u2019 was used to remind a participant about their prior selection. Then, a jittered fixation cross (1300\u20137600\u00a0ms) was presented, which was followed by the peer feedback superimposed under the photograph (2600\u00a0ms). After the feedback, a jittered fixation cross (1300\u20135200\u00a0ms) was displayed, and next a participant received a prompt, \u2018  How does this make you feel?  \u2019 and was instructed to provide a rating on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (very bad) to 100 (very good). Feedback was provided in pseudorandom order with no more than three trials of the same feedback type provided consecutively. Unbeknownst to the participants, feedback was fixed, as all participants received the same number of acceptance (30 interested trials) and rejection (30 not interested trials) trials. Participants utilized the button box to rate their feedback on a visual analogue scale presented on the presentation computer. After completing the Chatroom Task, participants were debriefed. \n  \nTrial design of Chatroom Task\u2014A single trial design of the Phase 3 of the Chatroom Task during the fMRI acquisition. \n  \n\n### Computational model of social value \n  \nLearning occurs when there is a discrepancy between expected and actual outcome, leading to a prediction error (PE). The value of the stimuli is then updated using this PE, explained by the following equation: \n\nComputation of social value is straightforward in our paradigm, as all participants specify each of their subjective ratings. This provides the opportunity to compute social value and investigate brain regions that encode this value. First, participants\u2019 initial selection on whether they will be interested in chatting with the peers was represented as   V   (  Initial Value  ), with \u2018not interested\u2019 coded as 0 and \u2018interested\u2019 coded as 100 (i.e. Phase 1). Next, during Phase 2, participants rated their expectation on how interested peers would be in chatting with them on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (  not very interested  ) to 100 (  very interested  ), which reflected their   Expected Value   (EV). Finally, when participants were in the scanner, they received explicit feedback and rated how this feedback made them feel on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (  very bad  ) to 100 (  very good  ), which represented the   Social Outcome   (O; modulated by individuals\u2019 social sensitivity; i.e. Phase 3). Average Subjective ratings and model derived Social Value during the task are reported in  . \n\n\n### Imaging data acquisition \n  \nFunctional MRI data were acquired at the McLean Imaging Center on a Siemens Tim Trio 3 Tesla MR scanner using a 32-channel head coil. For functional scans, data were acquired in an interleaved fashion using T2*-weighted gradient echo planer images (EPIs), with the following parameters TR/TE: 1300/32.2\u00a0ms; FOV: 212\u00a0mm; echo spacing\u2009=\u20090.69\u00a0ms; matrix: 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964; 72 slices; in-plane resolution: 2\u00a0mm; flip angle\u2009=\u200966\u00b0; voxels 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d72\u00a0mm; multiband factor\u2009=\u20098. A multiecho MPRAGE T1 structural image was acquired with the following parameters: TR: 2200\u00a0ms; TE1/TE2/TE3/TE4: 1.54/3.36/5.18/7\u00a0ms; voxel size: 1.2\u2009\u00d7\u20091.2\u2009\u00d7\u20091.2\u00a0mm; 144 slices. A field map was also acquired to correct for distortions with the following parameters: TR: 1000\u00a0ms; TE1/TE2: 10/12.46\u00a0ms; voxel size: 3.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091.8\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u00a0mm; 51 slices. \n\n\n### Imaging data pre-processing \n  \nFunctional MRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12;  ). Based on visual inspection of hardware-related artifacts in the raw images, two participants were excluded due to poor quality and were not processed further. For the remaining 68 participants\u2019 scans, distortion correction was applied using field maps acquired in the task session. Functional images were then realigned to the mean image of the series, corrected for motion and slice timing-related artifacts, co-registered with the anatomical image, normalized to the 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u00a0mm MNI template and smoothed with a 4\u00a0mm Gaussian kernel. A two-step procedure was utilized to account for motion correction. First, participants who had extensive movement (>4\u00a0mm or 4\u00b0 rotation from the reference first volume) throughout the task were excluded (  n  \u2009=\u20095). Second, for participants who had extensive movement only in the later part of the task, to increase the study power, only the first portion of these trials that was devoid of extensive movement were included and the latter part was excluded (e.g. first 60%, 72%, 99%, 42%, 90% trials from the entire task were included for 5 of the 63 adolescents). Then, the Artifact Detection Toolbox (ART) was used to identify outlier scans in global signal (>\u00b19 SD) and movement (>2\u00a0mm of movement or 2\u00b0 of rotation from the previous volume). Participants with more than 7% trials excluded by ART were excluded from the analyses (  n  \u2009=\u20098). These outlier trials identified by ART were distributed throughout the task, unlike the extensive movement observed only in the first part of the task of the above participants. Mean percent of trials removed by ART for the remaining participants was 2.25\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7%. The final sample included 55 adolescents (17 males and 38 females). \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nFirst-level general linear model included six unmodulated regressors, corresponding to onset times of each event (cue, anticipation, feedback, post-feedback ISI and feedback rating) with a boxcar function spanning the entire duration of each event. To investigate brain regions that encoded the trial-by-trial computations of social value signals during the Chatroom Task, we parametrically modulated model-derived social values (Vnew) with a post-feedback ISI unmodulated regressor and convolved with a hemodynamic response function. The covariates of no interest included inter-trial interval, ART regressors, six motion realignment parameters and a constant term modeling the baseline of unchanged neural activation. For each participant, the linear coefficients of social value regressor were compared to 0 and the resulting contrast images were taken to conduct one sample   t   test to identify brain regions that encode social value. To test the temporal specificity of these social value signals, we parametrically modulated model-derived social values (Vnew) with a feedback rating unmodulated regressor in a separate general linear model. \n  \nWhole brain results\u2014Brain activity correlated with social value derived from the computational model across all individuals.

Participants endorsed the following races: 85.5% White, 5.5% Asian, 3.6% Black or African American and 5.5% multiple races. The family\u2019s income distribution included the following: 54.5%\u2009=\u2009more than $100\u2009000, 18.2%\u2009=\u2009$75\u2009000 to $100\u2009000, 9.1%\u2009=\u2009$50\u2009000 to $75\u2009000 and 18.2%\u2009=\u2009not reported. These are summarized in  . \n\n\n### Chatroom behavioral data \n  \nTo determine whether the task manipulation was believable, at the end of the session, the experimenter asked a series of questions that participants rated on a scale from 1 to 10 (higher scores reflect more positive responses for questions 1 and 2, but more negative responses for questions 3, 4 and 5; all were significantly different than zero,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001): (1) \u2018  How interested were you in this task?  \u2019 (6.46\u2009\u00b1\u20092.23); (2) \u2018  How happy were you when someone expressed interest in chatting with you?  \u2019 (7.78\u2009\u00b1\u20091.76); (3) \u2018  How upset were you when someone rejected you?  \u2019 (4.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.97); (4) \u2018  How angry were you when someone rejected you?  \u2019 (2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.82); and (5) \u2018  How nervous did you feel while waiting for the other person to make their choice?  \u2019 (4.25\u2009\u00b1\u20092.49). Outlier criterion was defined as \u00b13 SD on any item response; no participant data were removed based on these criteria. Collectively, these ratings indicate that the task elicited the intended effects, and all participants were effectively deceived by the task manipulation. \n\n\n### Whole brain analyses \n  \nConsistent with our hypothesis, we observed social value signals encoded in the mPFC (peak voxel: \u22122, 44, \u22126;   z  \u2009=\u20095.36; cluster size: 458). In addition, social value signals were observed in regions associated with social processing, including the left amygdala (peak voxel: \u221214, \u22126, \u221220;   z  \u2009=\u20094.99; cluster size: 61) and left precuneus (peak voxel: \u22126, \u221256, 8;   z  \u2009=\u20094.16; cluster size: 168). Two other regions that encoded social value were the right lingual gyrus (peak voxel: 12, \u221278, \u22124; z\u2009=\u20094.37; cluster size: 62) and left fusiform gyrus (peak voxel: \u221248, \u221276, \u22124;   z  \u2009=\u20093.96; cluster size: 132). All clusters were   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 FWE cluster-corrected (with initial cluster forming threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.001;  ;  , A). \n\n#### Temporal specificity of social value signals \n  \nTo test the temporal specificity of social value signals, we modeled them at the time of feedback rating in a separate general linear model. However, we did not find value signals to be encoded in any of the regions except the lingual gyrus (peak voxel: 10, \u221278, \u22122;   z  \u2009=\u20094.96; cluster size: 69;  , B) during feedback rating. This suggests that the computation of social value occurs immediately after the feedback outcome. \n\n\n#### Exploratory analysis evaluating sex differences in social value encoding \n  \nMounting evidence suggests that females perceive and process social information differently than males ( ;  ). To explore sex differences, we extracted beta weights from the five clusters (mPFC, precuneous, amygdala, lingual and fusiform gyrus). Social value encoding in the fusiform and lingual gyri did not differ between boys and girls. However, in regions specific to social computation (mPFC, precuneus and left amygdala), girls exhibited greater social value encoding than boys (all   P  \u2009<\u20090.05; mPFC\u2014  t  (53)\u2009=\u20092.55;   P  \u2009=\u20090.014;   d  \u2009=\u20090.74, amygdala\u2014  t  (53)\u2009=\u20092.79;   P  \u2009=\u20090.007;   d  \u2009=\u20090.81, precuneus\u2014  t  (53)\u2009=\u20092.22;   P  \u2009=\u20090.03;   d  \u2009=\u20090.65). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nNavigating peer relationships is critical during adolescence. In this study, we investigated the neural correlates of the social valuation network in healthy adolescents using an ecologically valid peer evaluation paradigm. Unlike prior studies in this area ( ;  ), trial-by-trial social values were calculated based on the individuals\u2019 selection of peers, expectation of peers\u2019 interest in chatting with them and their subjective feeling after the outcome that signaled peers\u2019 interests in them. Consistent with the \u2018common neural currency\u2019 theory ( ), and our hypothesis, whole-brain analyses revealed that these social value signals were encoded in the mPFC across all individuals. Interestingly, our analyses also revealed a wider social-specific valuation network that included the precuneus cortex and amygdala. \n\nPrior studies that have utilized this paradigm have investigated the average neural activation during peer acceptance and rejection, but have not capitalized on the trial-by-trial computations that occur during peer evaluation [Note: Average neural responses to peer acceptance vs rejection were consistent with prior research ( ), thereby validating the task, see  ]. In addition, most studies often focus only on \u2018interested peers\u2019 trials, thereby neglecting a potentially valuable component of the task. Using a computational framework, we were able to identify brain regions that track social value parameters, providing insight into the neurobiology of social choice behavior. In addition, it enabled us to compare complex social behavior with other social and non-social decision-making. \n\nThere is a robust consensus that the mPFC plays a critical role in the dynamic computation of values associated with both primary (e.g. food) and secondary (e.g. monetary) non-social stimuli ( ;  ). However, whether the valuation of social outcomes or social rewards relies on the mPFC is a subject of ongoing investigations. There is some support for the involvement of the mPFC in processing socially relevant information. For instance, representation of the self and others ( ), cooperative human partners ( ) and mentalizing ( ) recruit the mPFC. Similarly, lesion studies in non-human primates have shown that this region is critical for establishing social interest in other individual macaques ( ). Complementing these findings, mPFC activation has been found to correlate with individuals\u2019 propensity to pay more money to view an attractive face ( ). Partially supporting a shared valuation system, self-reported ratings of facial attractiveness were encoded in the mPFC, suggesting that the subjective reward value of social stimuli may be coded similarly to primary and secondary rewards ( ). This would suggest that the brain maps these different reward types on a common scale to guide choices ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Consistent with this assumption, recent meta-analyses have highlighted overlapping value encoding for both simple social (e.g. attractiveness, praise, smile) and non-social rewards (e.g. money, juice) in the mPFC (Chase, Kumar, Eickhoff, & Dombrovski, 2015;  ;  ;  ). Moreover, findings have extended to more complex social rewards, including during collaborative decision-making ( ) and intention to trust a partner during economic exchange games ( ). Our results add to this body of research, suggesting that updating of social value associated with peer evaluations also recruits the mPFC. Even though our task did not have a learning component, our results suggest that computation of these social values might drive behavioral change during social decision-making recruiting regions similar to the non-social reinforcement learning circuitry. \n\nApart from the mPFC, social value signals also were encoded in other socially relevant brain regions including the amygdala and precuneus cortex. It is possible that during social decision-making, the mPFC communicates with higher level social processing regions to encode social perception. Even though we did not hypothesize social value to be encoded in the amygdala and precuneus, it is not surprising that these regions encode social value, considering their involvement in processing social stimuli ( ). In addition, aberrant (increased) amygdala function to social feedback has been associated with both adult and adolescent anxiety and depressive disorders ( ;  ;  ;  ). In contrast, the precuneus is thought to support mentalizing processes, facilitating an individual\u2019s ability to comprehend or interpret other people\u2019s thoughts, feelings and intentions ( ;  ). The precuneus also might contribute to self-referential processing ( ) and, similar to our findings, has been implicated in social rejection and exclusion ( ). Further supporting the idea that these regions contribute to computation of subjective value for social rewards,   showed that connectivity between the mPFC and a network of regions including the amygdala and precuneus predicted individual differences in valuation to social rewards. Interestingly, these regions represent dominant hubs of the default mode network (DMN), which are thought to be activated largely at \u2018rest\u2019. However, the DMN also was active during tasks that require participants to understand and interact with others, and interpreting self and others\u2019 emotional status, suggesting a substantial overlap between the brain regions typically involved in social cognitive processes and the default system ( ). Other brain region that was observed to encode these social value signals was the fusiform gyrus. Although reward-related responses in the fusiform gyrus have been identified ( ;  ), this study argued that these signals may reflect attentional processing rather than reward processing   per se   ( ). \n\nMounting evidence suggests that females perceive and process social information differently than males ( ;  ). In addition, central for our study, girls have been shown to exhibit increased sensitivity to social rejection ( ). Consistent with this finding, we found girls to have an increased social value signaling in the mPFC, amygdala and precuneus. This was observed despite girls and boys perceiving peer feedback similarly (boys and girls did not differ in the task manipulation questionnaire scores that rated on their subjective feelings during the task). This is interesting, as some studies have demonstrated increased sensitivity to the interpersonal stressors in girls, but achievement stressors in boys ( ). Whether sex-specific neural responses to peer evaluation might index differential risk for adolescent depression is an important question for future studies. Specifically, previous research has shown increased neural responses to peer rejection to be associated with both current adolescent depression ( ) and future risk for depressive symptoms. The present results suggest that girls are more attuned to social evaluation, giving more importance to social feedback when compared with boys, and recruit more strongly regions critically implicated in computation of social value (mPFC, precuneus and left amygdala). It is possible that this increased social value encoding in girls might be a risk factor of future depression if efficient adaptation of these events is not achieved. However, caution is warranted, as these analyses were exploratory in nature and included uneven groups. It is, therefore, crucial for future research to investigate the longitudinal neural markers of peer evaluation in girls and boys and identify interventions to overcome the negative effects of these interpersonal stressors. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nFour limitations warrant attention. First, the modest ethnic distribution within this sample limits the generalizability of the findings. Second, the age range was restricted to 12 to 14\u00a0years old in order to reduce putative age-related effects. However, this restricted range may also limit the generalizability of these findings to younger or older youth. Third, the percent of excluded participants (21%) on the basis of gross motion is slightly higher compared to other studies. However, this is not surprising, as head motion is a significant concern for pediatric compared to adult imaging, and age is shown to inversely correlate with head motion ( ). Last, our task design allowed us to probe value computations occurring at every trial (even though a given trial does not influence the next one) and thereby identify brain regions that encode these computations. It does not, however, allow us to probe how computations in one trial might influence future responses in subsequent trials. However, we believe that our approach paves the way for future studies utilizing computational models on tasks that explicitly compute and predict trial-by-trial social values. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur findings highlight a common neural currency valuation region (mPFC) that is involved in social decision-making, along with a social-specific core (amygdala and precuneus). Social rewards can provide gateways towards learning about others, building personal social networks, and establishing close relationships. Understanding how we make social decisions and neural markers associated with it will help us navigate promising avenues for intervention. \n\n\n## Conflict of interest \n  \nOver the past 3\u00a0years, D.A.P. has received consulting fees from Akili Interactive Labs, BlackThorn Therapeutics, Boehringer Ingelheim, Compass and Takeda and an honorarium from Alkermes, for activities unrelated to the current research.

Previous studies have reported abnormal changes in static functional connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, the dynamic characteristics of brain networks in PD is still poorly understood. This study aimed to quantify the characteristics of dynamic functional connectivity in PD patients at nodal, intra- and inter-subnetwork levels. Resting-state fMRI data of a total of 42 PD patients and 40 normal controls (NCs) were investigated from the perspective of the temporal variability on the connectivity profiles across sliding windows. The results revealed that PD patients had greater nodal variability in precentral and postcentral area (in sensorimotor network, SMN), middle occipital gyrus (in visual network), putamen (in subcortical network) and cerebellum, compared with NCs. Furthermore, at the subnetwork level, PD patients had greater intra-network variability for the subcortical network, salience network and visual network, and distributed changes of inter-network variability across several subnetwork pairs. Specifically, the temporal variability within and between subcortical network and other cortical subnetworks involving SMN, visual, ventral and dorsal attention networks as well as cerebellum was positively associated with the severity of clinical symptoms in PD patients. Additionally, the increased inter-network variability of cerebellum-auditory pair was also correlated with clinical severity of symptoms in PD patients. These observations indicate that temporal variability can detect the distributed abnormalities of dynamic functional network of PD patients at nodal, intra- and inter-subnetwork scales, and may provide new insights into understanding PD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people around the world. The prominent symptoms in PD are the motor deficits including tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, which are mainly due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra ( ;  ). Previous studies had proposed that the dysfunction of corticostriatal network pathways and neural circuits is related to the impairments in PD ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Despite being extensively investigated, mechanisms underlying disturbances in PD are still poorly understood. \n\nThe past decade has seen remarkable growth of network neuroscience and neuroimaging techniques and their applications to abnormal brain connectivity in psychiatric and neurological disorders. Several previous studies highlighted that PD could be considered as a disease related to the disruptions in several networks using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) ( ;  ), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) ( ), task fMRI ( ) and other imaging techniques ( ). Functional network analysis based on resting-state fMRI data, accounting for the intrinsic blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fluctuations, offers an effective tool for characterizing interactions between brain regions and quantifying abnormal organization of brain network in disorders ( ;  ,  ). Previous studies on large-scale network of PD patients by graph theoretic analysis revealed disruptions in the topological properties of brain networks and these network measures have been demonstrated to serve as potential biomarkers of PD for clinical diagnosis ( ). Furthermore, altered modular organization of functional brain networks in PD patients has also been reported ( ;  ), implying an abnormal functional integration of PD. \n\nHowever, the majority of earlier studies have adopted a \u201cstatic\u201d point of view, whereas functional connectivity (FC) between regions are actually associated with dynamic brain activity over time ( ;  ). Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis has been directed to assess relevant FC fluctuations and examine how functional organization evolves over time. It sheds new insights on the dynamic spatiotemporal organization of resting brain activity and captures FC alterations induced by disease pathologies ( ;  ). For example, previous studies have found that Schizophrenia (SZ) patients displayed within-network disruptions of the DMN ( ) as well as weaker across-network connectivity between DMN and other resting-state networks (RSNs) ( ;  ). In addition, the dynamic connectivity patterns have served as features to gain better identification output in the classification of MCI subjects ( ) and of autism patients ( ) than the standard static approaches. These results suggest that the abnormal network characteristics of PD may emerge from dynamic functional connections that cannot be completely captured by static approaches and may help deepen our understanding of this disease. \n\nDespite these applications, alterations in the dynamic properties of PD individuals still remain largely unknown.   first investigated the temporal states of dFC and variability of network topology in PD patients using k-means clustering, and found that PD patients showed a decrease in the sparsely connected State I, paralleled by an increase in the stronger interconnected State II, suggesting the altered functional segregation and abnormal global integration in brain networks.   employed Product Hidden Markov Models (PHMM) to assess the connectivity state changes between a set of RSNs in dementia with Lewy bodies, a disease sharing similar features to PD, and figured out networks (i.e., occipito-parieto-frontal network, the medial occipital network and the right fronto-parietal network) related to impairment of cognitive function in patients. However, these studies mainly focused on the connectivity state changes of the whole brain, ignoring the dynamic connectivity profile of particular brain regions. A recent work ( ) investigated the temporal properties of dFC by defining the temporal variability of FCs associated with a specific brain region, and the temporal variability reveled a strong correlation with BOLD/EEG activity. This approach allows localization of regions showing significant variability between groups, thus helping to reveal the abnormality of regional dynamics of functional brain networks in various brain diseases. Another work ( ) integrated both temporal and spatial variabilities of dynamic functional networks for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and boosted the diagnosis performance, demonstrating that the spatio-temporal interaction patterns can provide important information on the underlying nature of neurodegenerative disease. Actually, PD is a disease associated with a disruption across diffuse areas of brain and interactions of multiscale organization. However, the temporal properties of subnetworks (e.g., the intra- and inter-network variability) have not been investigated yet. Temporal variability may help elucidate the aberrant changes underlying PD patients from the perspective of regional dynamics of functional brain networks. A systematic examination of dFC patterns and temporal variability in aspects of nodal, intra- and inter- subnetworks may further deepen our understanding of PD. \n\nIn this study, we performed dFC analysis built on non-overlapping networks to investigate the aberrant dFC patterns in PD patients. With a focus on temporal variability of FC profiles, we systematically examined the dFC changes at nodal, intra- and inter- subnetwork levels. Our major goal was to demonstrate whether: (1) the temporal variability could characterize the underlying alterations in the PD cohort and/or (2) the changes in temporal variability could account for some clinical symptoms of PD. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants and Assessment \n  \nForty-four PD subjects were recruited from Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The inclusion criteria included: (i) a diagnosis of PD without any record of other neurological or psychiatric disorders; (ii) age \u2265 45 years; (iii) Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE ( )] \u2265 24; (iii) no depressive symptoms [evaluated by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) ( )]. Clinical evaluation was assessed with Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) score ( ) for the disease stage and the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale-Part III (UPDRS-III) ( ) for severity of motor symptoms. Forty-three normal controls (NCs) were also included for the study. Three normal participants with head motion >2 mm of translation or >2 degree of rotation and two PD patients with poor co-registration in cerebellum were excluded in the following analysis (see section \u201cData Preprocessing\u201d for details), leaving 42 patients and 40 normal controls for analysis. The relevant demographic and clinical information are summarized in  . This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the \u201cethics committee of Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China\u201d with written informed consent from all subjects. \n  \nDemographic data on patients and normal controls. \n    \n\n### MRI Acquisition \n  \nData acquisition was carried out on a GE 3.0 T HDxt MRI scanner with an 8-channel phased-array head coil. High-resolution T1-weighted MRI scans were acquired using a fast, spoiled gradient echo sequence (FSPGR) with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 5.528 ms, echo time (TE) = 1.74 ms, matrix size = 256 \u00d7 256, flip angle = 12\u00b0, slice thickness = 1 mm, 196 sagittal slices. A total of 210 volumes of resting-state fMRI data were acquired using an EPI sequence with the following parameters: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, matrix size = 64 \u00d7 64, flip angle = 90\u00b0, voxel size = 3.75 \u00d7 3.75 \u00d7 4 mm . Subjects were required to remain still and awake with eyes closed during the scan. \n\n\n### Data Preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing of fMRI data was performed using the DPARSF toolbox ( ). The first 10 volumes of each functional time series were discarded considering instability of the initial MRI signal and adaptation of participants to the circumstance, leaving 200 volumes in total for processing as follows: slice-timing, realignment to the mean image, co-registration to the T1 image, motion correction, normalized to a standard template (Montreal Neurological Institute), reslicing to 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm , spatial smoothing (FWMH = 6 mm) and band pass filtered (0.01\u20130.1 Hz). Finally, the nuisance covariates, including 24 head motion parameters, white matter signal, and CSF signal were regressed out. The resulting time courses were used for the following brain network construction and analysis. In order to limit the impact of head motion, we excluded the subjects with head motion greater than 2 mm of translation motion or more than 2 degrees of rotation. \n\n\n### Definition of Functional Brain Networks \n  \nWe adopted the spherical 264 functional Region of Interests (ROIs) defined by   across cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar structures, and extracted a representative BOLD time series by averaging signal in all voxels within each ROI. These brain regions were defined by resting-state FC mapping and multiple task fMRI meta-analysis, ensuring the functional significance of network nodes. In brain network analysis, each ROI was defined as a node, and the functional connectivity between ROIs was estimated from the corresponding representative BOLD time series. Consistent with previous study ( ), the whole brain were mapped into 13 putative functional modules, including sensorimotor (SMN), default mode (DMN), cingulo-opercular (CON), fronto-parietal (FPN), subcortical, salience (SAN), auditory, visual, ventral attention (VAN), dorsal attention (DAN), memory retrieval, cerebellum, and uncertain networks ( ). This parcellation offers a comprehensive view for the study of functional brain modules, allowing to identify connectivity patterns and interactions between different modules. In this study, we would mainly report and discuss the results related to the 12 main networks but paying no attention to the \u201cUncertain\u201d network, as it does not constitute specific cortical networks with explicable function. \n  \nSchematic overview of the temporal variability calculation.   (A)   Network partition of 264 putative functional regions defined by   L, Left; R, right.   (B)   Each regional BOLD signal was segmented into non-overlapping windows, and the whole brain functional connectivity network was constructed using Pearson correlation of the representation BOLD time series in each window.   (C)   From the raw functional connectivity matrix in one time window, nodal connectivity profile is the vector that describes its connectivity with all the other nodes (e.g., the column marked by black line); intra-subnetwork connectivity profile is the upper triangle (due to symmetry) of the connectivity matrix within one subnetwork (e.g., SMN); inter-network connectivity profile is the connectivity matrix between two subnetworks (e.g., SMN-visual, as the block marked by a small black rectangular window).   (D)   Calculation of temporal variability. The nodal, intra- and inter-network connectivity profile in each window was unfolded into connectivity vectors, respectively, and the temporal variability was calculated as the average correlation coefficients of the connectivity vectors across different windows with a deduction from 1. \n  \nFor better interpretation for the anatomical location of specific regions, the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas ( ) was also used in this study. \n\n\n### Temporal Variability \n  \nFor each participant, dFC were computed based on sliding temporal window approach. Following the strategy in Zhang\u2019s work ( ), we used segments of BOLD time series without overlapping to calculate temporal variability (nodal, intra- and inter-network variability). Briefly, the entire BOLD time series for each subject was divided into non-overlapping windows. Then within each window, connectivity between each pair of nodes was estimated by the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients of the BOLD time series ( ). \n\n#### Nodal Variability \n  \nTo characterize the dynamic configuration of a specific region across all time windows, we calculated the temporal variability of each node ( ;  ). For a given region   k  , the connectivity profile at time window   i   can be denoted as   F  , which is a vector with   M   values that describes the connection map based on the connectivity between region   k   with all other regions. Then the connectivity vectors in different windows were subsequently used to estimate the variability   V   of brain region   k  , which is defined as one minus the average correlation of that region\u2019s connectivity profile across all time windows ( ;  ), that is, \n\nwhere   N   denotes the number of windows ( ). The second part of   V   is the averaged correlation values between any two connectivity profiles derived from different time windows, indicating the similarity between connectivity profiles. A small value of variability   V   indicates a high correlation of a node\u2019s functional architecture across different time windows. \n\nAs for the parameters selection, previous studies suggested that window size around 30\u201360 s should be suitable to capture the resting-state dFC fluctuations and produce robust results ( ;  ;  ). And another study ( ) showed that changes of brain connectivity are not sensitive to the specific time-window length (in the range of 10\u201320 TRs, 20\u201340 s). We performed the variability analysis at different window length (  l   = 10, 11, 12, \u2026, 20 volumes, corresponding to 20, 22, 24, \u2026, 40 s, respectively), and found that variability obtained from different window lengths produced highly correlated results (  r   > 0.98,  ), indicating that this metric is not sensitive to the choice of window length. Therefore, in the following sections, we reported the results obtained with the window size of 20TRs (40 s). \n\n\n#### Intra- and Inter-Network Variability \n  \nThe connectivity patterns within and between subnetworks also fluctuate dynamically over a short period of time ( ;  ;  ). In order to assess the dynamic interactions within and between subnetworks and identify the system-level dynamic brain organization, we defined the intra- and inter- network variability in a way similar to the definition of nodal variability. For a subnetwork, all the intra-network connectivity in each window were unfolded into a long connectivity vector, and then the intra-network variability was estimated as the average correlation coefficients of the connectivity vectors across different windows with a deduction from 1 ( ). Intra-network variability characterizes the changes of connectivity within subnetwork over time. High value of intra-network variability means the functional architecture within the network is poorly correlated across different time windows, implying an unstable state. Similarly, for two subnetworks, all the connectivity between the two subnetworks were unfolded into a long connectivity vector, and then the inter-network variability was estimated as the average correlation coefficients of the connectivity vectors across windows with a deduction from 1 ( ). High value of inter-network variability means that the interactions between the two networks reconfigure frequently but not maintain a stable pattern. \n\n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nNon-parametric permutation tests ( ;  ) were applied to test the between-group differences in nodal, intra- and inter-network variability. In each permutation, each subject was randomly reassigned to one of a pair of groups with the same number of subjects as in the original patient and control groups. Then the nodal, intra- and inter-network variability were computed for each randomized group and the between-group difference for all the metrics was calculated, respectively. This randomization procedure was repeated 10000 times, resulting in a sampled null between-group difference permutation distributions for each metric. Finally, the   p  -value was then calculated as the proportion of total entries resulting from the permutation distribution that were greater than (or smaller than) the observed group effect. \n\nStatistical analysis for head motion parameters and demographic measures were performed using two sample   t  -test. Spearman correlation analysis was performed between altered temporal variability and clinical variables of disease severity (UPDRS-III score and Hoehn and Yahr staging) at a threshold for statistical significance of   p   < 0.05. Statistical analysis of all the metrics were implemented using Matlab (version 2014a; MathWorks). Visualization of results were performed using Python. \n\n\n### Validation Analysis \n  \nTo evaluate the robustness of our main results, we conducted some validation analysis. (i) Parcellation scheme: given that the variability may be affected by the topological spatial constraints and definition of ROIs, we also constructed functional brain networks using an additional functional whole-brain parcellation scheme consisting of 268 ROIs ( ) (referred to as Shen268 atlas), in which all the ROIs are assigned to eight different functional networks. (ii) Window length: to investigate the potential effects of window length, we performed the correlation analysis of temporal variability obtained at different window lengths, and also repeated the analysis with the average value of variability across different window lengths, following the strategy used in  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Nodal Variability \n  \nWe found significant nodal variability changes in PD patients across several regions. The nodal variability of precentral and postcentral gyrus (in SMN), middle occipital gyrus (in visual network), putamen (in subcortical network) and cerebellum in patients showed significantly increased variability (  p   < 0.005, 10000 permutations, uncorrected) compared to NCs ( ). While in this PD cohort, no nodes showed significantly decreased variability. \n  \nRegions showing significant higher nodal variability in PD patients than normal controls. \n  \n\n### Intra-Network Variability \n  \nAmong the 13 subnetworks, we found that subnetworks including subcortical network, SAN and visual network tended to display greater intra-network variability in PD than NCs (  p   < 0.05, 10000 permutations,  ). Only the variability of intra-subcortical network showed a positive correlation with UPDRS-III by spearman correlation analysis ( ). \n  \n (A)   The intra-network variability of 13 subnetworks for PD patients and NCs, respectively.

Generally, the intra-network variability of a particular subnetwork demonstrated a relatively lower value than the inter-network variability of that subnetwork with other subnetworks, respectively in both PD and NC groups ( , NC group: all   p  -values no larger than 0.0181, 10000 permutations; PD group: all   p  -values no larger than 0.0001, 10000 permutations). Between group comparisons for the variability matrices revealed significantly greater inter-network variability in PD patients compared with NCs in several subnetwork pairs associated with SMN, visual, subcortical networks and cerebellum. \n  \n (A)   Mean intra- and inter-network variability matrix of NCs.   (B)   Mean intra- and inter- network variability matrix of PD patients. Asterisks ( ) labeled on the PD matrix indicate the subnetwork pairs showing significantly increased intra- or inter-network variability in PD patients compared than control subjects.   p   < 0.05,   p   < 0.005. \n  \n\n#### Correlation Between Inter-Network Variability and UPDRS-III \n  \nWe further identified the subnetwork pairs which showed significant correlation (  p   < 0.05, Spearman correlation) to the clinical status. To ensure correlations are not driven by a few extreme values, we removed outliers in the data prior to performing linear regression. We defined an outlier as a value outside of 3 standard deviation from the group mean. Performing regression with and without outliers actually did not qualitatively change the results. \n\nSignificant correlation between inter-network variability and UPDRS-III mainly appeared in subnetwork pairs associated with subcortical network and cerebellum ( ). Compared with NCs, PD group had greater inter-network variabilities for the subnetwork pairs of subcortical network with respect to sensorimotor, visual, ventral attention, dorsal attention, and cerebellum networks, and their variability also had significant positive correlation with UPDRS-III in PD patients ( \u2013 ). In addition, the inter-network variability for subnetwork pairs of cerebellum and auditory network also showed group difference as well as significant positive correlation with UPDRS-III ( ). We have also evaluated the correlation between temporal variability and H-Y scores, while the results showed that the nodal/intra- and inter-network variability had a weak correlation (all   r   < 0.23, all   p   > 0.14) with H-Y scores. \n  \n (A\u2013E)   Subnetwork pairs associated with subcortical network had increased inter-network variability as well as significant correlation with UPDRS-III.

For each row from A to F, the left panel is the topographic representation of the nodes and the inter-network connectivity within the corresponding subnetwork pairs, respectively; the middle panel is the boxplot of inter-network variability for NC and PD groups, respectively; and the right panel is the scatterplot of the inter-network variability with respect to the UPDRS-III score for PD patients, with each dot indicating one subject, excluding outliers (outside of 3 standard deviation from the group mean). Error bars represent mean and standard errors of the two groups, respectively.

We found that the temporal variability including nodal, intra- and inter- network variability estimated from windows of different lengths were highly correlated, indicating that these metrics is not sensitive to the choice of window length. For further validation of the results, we also used the average variability across different window lengths for the same analysis procedures, the main results are highly similar with those at window length of 20TRs. For the results obtained at Shen268 atlas, we observed similar pattern of variability difference of two groups, which were mainly located at Subcortical-cerebellum, Motor, and Visual (Visual I, Visual II, Visual association) networks. Besides, the significant correlation between temporal variability and UPDRS-III also mainly appeared in subnetwork pairs associated with Subcortical-cerebellum network. These results replicated the main findings obtained with Power-264 atlas. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we investigated the variability of the dynamic functional brain network of PD patients at nodal, intra- and inter-network levels. Our results demonstrated that PD patients exhibited increased nodal variability involving precentral and postcentral areas, occipital area, putamen, and cerebellum. Moreover, PD patients demonstrated significantly increased intra-network variability within subcortical, salience and visual networks, as well as distributed increase in inter-network variability of several subnetwork pairs. Furthermore, the intra-network variability of subcortical network and the inter-network variability of subcortical network with respect to SMN, visual network, VAN, DAN and cerebellum showed significant correlation with the clinical score UPDRS-III, suggesting the special role of subcortical network in functional abnormality of PD. Besides, the inter-network variability of the cerebellum-auditory pair also had significant correlation with the clinical score UPDRS-III. These results suggest that PD patients showed widespread functional network abnormalities in term of temporal variability, and the abnormal temporal variability also correlated with clinical manifestations and thus offering new insights in understanding PD. \n\n### Distributed Variability Changes in PD Patients \n  \nAt the nodal and intra-network level, we found a widespread pattern of increased variability in PD patients, encompassing sensorimotor (SMN), visual, subcortical networks and cerebellum. A similar pattern was also observed in ROIs defined by the Shen268 atlas, that is, the variability difference was mainly located in Subcortical-cerebellum, Motor, and Visual (Visual I, Visual II, Visual association) subnetworks (  and  ). Previous study has reported that the primary sensorimotor area in normal subjects changed little over time ( ;  ). Conversely, in this study, the precentral and postcentral areas (in sensorimotor network) revealed higher variability in patients, unveiling that nodes in SMN of PD patients demonstrated a non-stationary functional configuration with other regions. In fact, several studies have identified abnormal functional connectivity in SMN which is indicative of impaired sensorimotor integration occurred in PD ( ;  ). Besides, the increased variability has also been observed in visual network both at nodal and intra-network levels. Indeed, visual network is another major complex sensory domain affected by PD, and PD may lead to visual hallucinations, perceptual, executive and sleep dysfunction ( ;  ;  ). These results together suggest that the altered dFC patterns observed in our study may be related to the deficits in these sensory regions. Moreover, the salience network, mainly comprised of the anterior insula, is a central hub involved in integrating the somatosensory and cognitive-affective information to guide behavior ( ). The increased intra-salience network variability found in our data corroborated previous findings of reduced hub role ( ) and abnormal activation patterns in insula in PD patients ( ,  ). In addition, there were other between-group differences in regional or inter-subnetwork variability associated with subcortical network and cerebellum, many of which have been suggested to be related to structural or functional impairment in PD patients ( ). Taken together, the abnormality of regional variability identified in our study indicates altered dFC across distributed nodes and subnetworks, reflecting those regions are at an unstable state. \n\nFor the inter-network variability, we found that the inter-motor variability was higher than intra-motor variability, which is consistent with previous studies ( ) that lower variability within subnetwork may maintain a more stable configuration. In addition, significant higher inter-network variability was found across distributed subsystem pairs. The varying interactions between subsystems may be tied to functional coordination between subnetworks ( ), the increased inter-network variability in PD patients implies an unstable state and more dynamic interactions. Our observations was consistent with  , which reported an increase in the number of transitions between states and higher variability in global efficiency of brain network of PD patients, implying a less efficient and more unstable information transfer within/between functional subnetworks. Furthermore, substantial efforts have been made in previous studies to elucidate the neural basis of PD, with mounting evidence indicating deficits of distributed brain networks and wide-spread white matter damage in PD ( ;  ;  ). Our results putatively reflect the abnormal global integration of the brain networks in PD from the dynamic perspective. \n\n\n### Variability Associated With Subcortical Network \n  \nDespite the distributed alteration of temporal variability in PD patients, the variability showing significant correlation with clinical score was particularly associated subcortical network ( ), suggesting its clinical significance in PD. Results obtained with the Shen268 atlas showed a similar trend, which were mainly associated with the Subcortical-cerebellum subnetwork ( ). At nodal and intra-network levels, a higher nodal variability in putamen and intra-network variability within subcortical network was observed, which is compatible with previous study highlighting the severely affected striatal dopamine depletion in putamen and reduced connectivity between striatal and thalamus within subcortical network ( ). At the inter-network level, the increased inter-network variability between subcortical network and cortical networks (sensorimotor, visual, and attention network) in PD patients also correlated with worsening motor symptoms in PD. All these cortical networks are known to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of PD ( ), and the dysfunction of cortico-BG-thalamo-cortical circuit associated with motor deficits is well documented in PD patients ( ). More specifically, altered functional connection and integration of subcortical to sensorimotor and visual networks have been reported in PD ( ;  ;  ). Connectivity changes and dysfunctional integration in attention work (including dorsal attention network (DAN) and ventral attention network (VAN)) have also been reported in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment and visual hallucinations, respectively ( ;  ). Here the higher level variability of FC profile in subcortical-cortical coupling may therefore provide further information for the prediction of disease severity. Furthermore, a significantly increased variability of cerebellum-subcortical coupling in PD patients was positive associated with UPDRS-III in our study. According to  , the reciprocal connections between basal ganglia and the cerebellum provide the anatomical substrate for the cerebellar contributions to a wide range of behaviors. The increased variability pattern between cerebellum and subcortical network, could also support the markedly lower striatal connectivity with cerebellum in PD group reported in  , thus reinforcing the relevance to parkinsonism of the described circuits connecting the cerebellum to the basal ganglia ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Variability Associated With Cerebellum \n  \nInterestingly, in the present study, the node in the cerebellum showed significantly increased nodal variability in PD patients. Studies have shown that the cerebellum is involved in motor coordination ( ) as well as integration of motor and cognitive networks. Pathological changes in the cerebellum have been reported in a previous study ( ). Considering this, our results revealed an abnormal dynamic connectivity profile between nodes in the cerebellum with other regions, which may be related to the dysfunction of cerebellum in PD patients. \n\nWe also found that a significantly increased inter-network variability between cerebellum and cortical network (auditory network) showed positive correlation with UPDRS-III. This emphasizes that the unstable dynamic interaction between the cerebellum and auditory network may also relate to the motor symptom of PD. Similar to basal ganglia in subcortical network, cerebellum has also shown anatomical loops between cerebellum and nearly all cortical subnetworks, suggesting its high global brain connectivity ( ;  ;  ). Combined with the observations that the inter-network variability between subcortical network and other cortical subnetworks as well as cerebellum were also correlated with clinical score (UPDRS-III) noted above, our results uncover the fact that cerebellum also serve as an important role in PD pathology. \n\nIn fact, the subcortical network in this study (mainly comprised of basal ganglia and thalamus) and the cerebellum are densely interconnected at the subcortical level and formed an integrated network ( ). These subcortical systems support the convergence of diverse cortical and subcortical afferents, as well as neuromodulatory signals from the brainstem, thus serving as a hub for large-scale network integration in the human brain ( ). Previous studies revealed that pathological lesions of most disorders were concentrated in hub regions, especially in the striatum and thalamus, implying that subcortical hubs represent key pathological foci across multiple brain disorders ( ). Evidence from previous studies has shown that cortico-subcortical circuits are linked to a diverse range of limbic, cognitive and motor control functions ( ;  ). PD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe and early subcortical pathology as well as clinical impairments extend across cognitive and motor domains. Our results provide further evidence of a subcortical hub by capturing the dynamic variability changes in the subcortical network of PD, suggesting that the subcortical dysfunction may contribute to pathological changes in PD. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nSeveral limitations of this study should be recognized. First, motor manifestations of PD subjects are evaluated only using the motor portion of UPDRS without other neuropsychological tests for the diagnosis of PD. There are other substantial non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction and sleep disorders experienced by PD patients ( ). Future work could investigate variability metrics and their association with other neuropsychological scores and cognitive performance to establish the relationship between dynamic analysis and clinical diagnosis. Second, PD is a heterogeneous disorder with different symptoms and functional connectivity patterns ( ). Due to the diversity of possible status of drug use, personality, or genetic factors in our data and a large number of comparisons, some results didn\u2019t pass a false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple comparisons correction. Accordingly, we reported the results by setting a relative low significance level (  p   < 0.005) in nodal variability and different statistic levels (  p   < 0.05 and   p   < 0.005) in intra- and inter-network variability. Actually, a more heterogeneous status in the patients\u2019 group will most likely lead to higher statistical variance, rendering it more difficult to detect significant functional connectivity differences between patients and controls. Therefore, a larger sample size and more strict inclusion criteria will be needed in further study to reveal temporal variability differences. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis study reported alterations of temporal variability in PD patients at nodal, intra- and inter-network levels. Our analysis showed that PD patients have higher nodal variability in precentral and postcentral area, middle occipital gyrus, putamen, cerebellum as well as the increased intra- and inter-motor variability across several distributed subnetworks compared with normal controls. Moreover, the higher intra- and inter-network variability associated with the subcortical network and cerebellum showed significant correlation with UPDRS-III motor score, suggesting its clinical significance. Our results suggest that temporal variability of functional connectivity profile can detect the aberrant dynamic connectivity patterns, which were associated with the clinical deficits in PD and thus may deepen our understanding of the disease. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe dynamic functional connectivity matrix used in our analysis are available from the authors upon reasonable request. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nHZ, JH, JS, and HL conceived and designed the study.

Little is known about possible differences between convicted and non-convicted pedophilic CSOs and why only some become known to the judicial system. This investigation takes a closer look at the two sides of \u201cchild sexual offending\u201d by focusing on clinical and neurobiological characteristics of convicted and non-convicted pedophilic CSOs as presented in the Neural Mechanisms Underlying Pedophilia and sexual offending against children (NeMUP)*-study. Seventy-nine male pedophilic CSOs were examined, 48 of them convicted. All participants received a thorough clinical examination including the structured clinical interview (SCID), intelligence, empathy, impulsivity, and criminal history. Sixty-one participants (38 convicted) underwent an inhibition performance task (Go/No-go paradigm) combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Convicted and non-convicted pedophilic CSOs revealed similar clinical characteristics, inhibition performances, and neuronal activation. However, convicted subjects\u2019 age preference was lower (i.e., higher interest in prepubescent children) and they had committed a significantly higher number of sexual offenses against children compared to non-convicted subjects. In conclusion, sexual age preference may represent one of the major driving forces for elevated rates of sexual offenses against children in this sample, and careful clinical assessment thereof should be incorporated in every preventive approach. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nWith a prevalence of 12.7%, child sexual offenses occur across most ethnic, religious and socioeconomic groups all over the world [ ]. This is especially devastating since the effects on children\u2019s wellbeing and development are tremendous and might persist until adulthood [ , , ]. The high prevalence in comparison to the low conviction rate of child sexual offenders (CSOs) [ ] suggests that the majority of CSOs may never get caught. The reasons for the low conviction rate remain unclear but could originate from three different circumstances: (1) Characteristics of the victim (e.g., age), (2) characteristics of the offender (e.g., being better at hiding the crime due to intelligence), and (3) circumstances of the crime (e.g., abuse by an intimate person). One of the most frequently described risk-factors concerning child sexual offending is a pedophilic preference which has been described in about 50% of convicted CSOs [ , ]. The International Classification of Diseases, tenth edition (ICD-10) [ ] defines diagnostic criteria of pedophilia as a sexual preference for children\u2014boys or girls or both\u2014usually of prepubertal or early pubertal age including the following criteria: \u201c(A) The general criteria for F65 disorders of sexual preference must be met (G1. Recurrent intense sexual urges and fantasies involving unusual objects or activities. G2. Acts on the urges or is markedly distressed by them. G3. The preference has been present for at least six months). (B) A persistent or a predominant preference for sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children. (C) The person is at least 16 years old and at least five years older than the child or children\u201d [ ]. \n\nPedophilia has often been linked to higher psychiatric comorbidities [ , , ] as well as neurobiological and neuropsychological alterations (e.g., [ ]). These results correspond to Krueger and Schiffer [ ], who showed that convicted pedophiles serving prison sentences in a forensic treatment facility performed lower on all subtests of a shortened IQ test than a control group except for completing images. Multiple studies showed coherence between pedophilic CSOs and impairment in behavioral inhibition [ , , ]. Nevertheless, Gerwinn et al. [ ] were one of the first revealing an effect of offender status but not of pedophilia on intelligence and other measures in their subgroups. Furthermore, it was shown that essential alterations of brain structure and function\u2014which were assumed to be pedophilia-specific\u2014were predominantly associated with child sexual offending rather than with the pedophilic preference [ , , , ]. Most importantly, K\u00e4rgel et al. [ ] even found non-offending pedophiles to perform significantly better in a behavioral inhibition task (go/nogo paradigm). This leads to the hypothesis that behavioral inhibition potentially secures non-offending pedophiles from acting upon their urges in comparison to sexually offending pedophiles. \n\nAlternatively, there may be effects such as the number of the victims and age of the offender that can lead to imprisonment. Neutze et al. [ ] found an age difference between detected and undetected pedophilic CSOs with the detected CSOs being older. Hence, it might be possible that being convicted is just a matter of time. The authors [ ] conclude that two sets of factors are associated with detection status: (1) \u201cpreceding\u201d ones that might influence whether an individual is detected (e.g., age or education) and (2) \u201cresulting\u201d ones which may either be a response to detection (e.g., emotion-oriented coping, childhood sexual victimization) or reflect a bias in self-report measures (e.g., sexual self-regulation problems, paraphilic interests) in order to avoid negative consequences (e.g., severe punishment) [ ]. \n\nIn the last years, research on neurobiological underpinnings of pedophilia has gained some attention. Unfortunately, the majority of the few studies focusing on child sexual offending and pedophilia mainly examined convicted CSOs. Some studies did not even take sexual preference into consideration at all when comparing groups of offenders and non-offenders. For that reason, results cannot be seen as representative for pedophilia in general, and findings are restricted to the particular group of convicted CSOs [ ]. Subsequently, it must be considered that there could be an offender effect rather than an effect of pedophilia itself. Hence, when investigating characteristics due to a pedophilic preference, it is crucial to distinguish between convicted pedophiles, non-convicted pedophiles, and convicted CSOs who are not pedophilic. \n\nThroughout the last years, the research consortium NeMUP, which is the acronym for \u201cneural mechanisms underlying pedophilia and sexual offending against children\u201d, discriminated between pedophilia and child sexual offending by using a two by two factorial design (offender status/pedophilia). Results of the NeMUP consortium showed increased levels of psychiatric comorbidities, sexual dysfunctions, and adverse childhood experiences among pedophiles as well as child sexual offenders [ ]. Additionally, regression analyses were more powerful in segregating offender status than sexual preference (mean classification accuracy: 76% versus 68%). In summary, results of the NeMUP consortium showed that executive dysfunctions in CSOs are rather small and may be independent of pedophilic preferences. Neurobiological assessment showed changes in brain structure, metabolism [ ] and function, which were particularly associated with the offending status but not with pedophilic preference [ , , , ]. \n\nRegarding the characteristics of victims that might differentiate between convicted and non-convicted CSOs, it is important to acknowledge that the authors have no intention to blame victims of sexual offenses. Nevertheless, some victim related factors might decrease the likelihood of incarceration of the offenders. It has been shown that children who were older, came from incestuous families, felt greater responsibility for the abuse, and feared negative consequences of disclosure took longer to disclose a crime [ ]. Additionally, the sex of the victim could possibly discriminate between convicted and non-convicted CSOs. Since it could be shown that reports of female victims are twice as frequent as of male victims [ ] it is also possible that males are victimized equally often but report sexual offenses less frequently [ ]. This might be caused by more intense feelings of shame and guilt [ ]. Finally, another factor that might differentiate between convicted and non-convicted CSOs may be the quality of the relationship between offender and victim. Whereas it is more probable that sexual offenses against children are committed by a relative or a good friend of the family [ , ] this could also lead to a dilemma concerning a complaint to the police. \n\nWhile the current investigation did not put an emphasis on victims\u2019 characteristics, it was designed to carefully analyze clinical, neuropsychological and neurobiological features of convicted and non-convicted CSOs in order to unravel possible factors that might increase or decrease the probability to be convicted. \n\n\n## 2. Method \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nParticipants of the study were recruited by research associates and practicing psychotherapists as part of the multi-site research project \u201cNeural Mechanisms Underlying Pedophilia and Sexual Offending against Children\u201d (NeMUP,  ) which includes five collaborative research sites from (forensic) psychiatry or sexual medicine located in Berlin, Bochum/Essen, Hanover, Kiel and Magdeburg. Most sites of the project were involved in the prevention project \u201cDon\u2019t offend\u201d ( ) for self-identified pedophiles seeking therapy [ ]. Additionally, some subjects were recruited in prisons or during fulfilment of a suspended sentence. Moreover, the official \u201cNeMUP\u201d-website ( ) as well as various German internet forums were used to inform self-identified pedophilic men and child sex offenders without pedophilia about the study [ ]. For a detailed description of recruitment and collection of the whole NeMUP data, the reader is kindly asked to take a look at Gerwin et al. [ ]. The present study only included the NeMUP sample of pedophiles who committed child sexual offenses in the analysis. This group (CSO) contains men who fulfill the criteria of being pedophile/hebephile and have committed at least one \u201chands-on\u201d [ ] delict against children under the age of 14. All participants provided written informed consent before participating, and all local ethics committees located in Berlin, Bochum/Essen, Hanover, Kiel, and Magdeburg approved the study (approval code 6048). \n\nWhile pedophilia is a sexual preference for prepubescent children and teleiophilia is a sexual responsiveness to adults [ ], hebephilia is defined as a sexual preference for children in early pubertal stages. The hebephilic group was subsumed under the label of pedophilia according to ICD-10 that defines pedophilia as a \u201csexual preference for children\u2026of pre-pubertal or early pubertal stage\u201d (ICD 10). \n\n\u201cHands-on\u201d delicts were defined as sexual acts that involved touching or manipulating the child\u2019s naked body or genitals (manually or orally) by the offender with the intention of sexually stimulating himself, penetrating the child (anally or vaginally) or forcing the child to (anally or vaginally) penetrate or touch/manipulate the offenders\u2019 genitals [ ]. Pedophiles who had not committed such a \u201chands-on\u201d offense and/or who were currently or historically consumers of material that shows the sexual exploitation of children or so-called indicative pictures (e.g., fully clothed children in erotic poses) were not assigned into this group. This procedure does in no way indicate to degrade such behavior as \u201cnon-criminal\u201d, it was used to differentiate between pedophiles who were or were not able to refrain from direct sexual behavior towards children. \n\nIn the present study, the group of CSOs was divided into two different subgroups. The first subgroup (non-convicted CSOs) contained men who had not been convicted for their sexual offenses against children, hence pedophiles in the so-called \u201cdark field\u201d. The other group (convicted CSOs) included men that had been convicted for their crimes. Men belonging to the non-convicted CSOs were mainly recruited within the \u201cDon\u2019t Offend\u201d project in Germany [ ] and various German internet forums. Participants who were categorized into the subgroup of convicted CSOs were recruited in prisons or during fulfillment of suspended sentences. Exclusion criteria were acute psychiatric or neurological disorders others than pedophilia, acute episodes of alcohol or drug abuse as well as past dependencies and current medication related to sexual functioning. Overall, 31 non-convicted CSOs and 48 convicted CSOs were incorporated into data analysis. \n\n\n### 2.2. Procedure \n  \nData were collected in two different sessions over two days. The first session included the survey of interviews and diagnostic data, whereas during the second session the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment was performed. \n\nStructured clinical interview for DSM (SCID) [ ] enabled to screen for DSM Axis I and Axis II disorders. \n\nSemi-structured interview was performed in order to gain information about the participants\u2019 sexual interaction interest(s), child pornography consumption, history of offenses in general and biographical information (e.g., age of first coitus, psychiatric disorders in family, own children). \n\nSexual gender and age orientation was measured by a modification of the Kinsey Scale [ ] where participants were asked to indicate range and peak for the age and sex of their preferred sexual partner using the Tanner stages I to V [ ]. In case of uncertainty concerning the age preference legal information (if available) and individual case conferences were utilized to ensure a valid clinical diagnosis. \n\nIntelligence was estimated by the German version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) [ ]. Global intelligence was assessed by means of four subtests (\u201cSimilarities\u201d, \u201cVocabulary\u201d, \u201cBlock Design\u201d, and \u201cMatrix Reasoning\u201d) [ ]. All assessments were carried out by experienced research associates, trained to use these instruments. \n\nChildhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ) [ ] was given to the participants to estimate the burden of self-experienced abuse and neglect. The questionnaire screens for a history of five different types of maltreatment (sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect and emotional neglect). Moreover, an assessment of psychiatric and criminal history of both parents was included in the semi-structured interview for assessing other relevant clinical variables. In the current paper, the difference between the five different types of maltreatment for each group was used to describe differences in experienced childhood trauma. Thresholds for severe childhood trauma can be found at Glaesmer et al. [ ]. \n\nEmpathy was measured using the multifaceted empathy test (MET) [ ]. The MET consists of 26 photographs, mostly depicting people in emotionally charged situations. The test assesses cognitive empathy by requiring subjects to deduce mental states of the individuals shown in the photographs. In order to address emotional empathy participants also rate their own emotional reaction in response to the pictures. Unfortunately, no cut-off values for the MET can be found in the literature. However, since the paper focuses on the differentiation between two groups the differences between both groups were used to describe differences in empathy. \n\nBarratt impulsiveness scale (BIS-11) [ ] was used to measure self-reported impulsiveness. The questionnaire consists of 30 items and is designed to assess three facets of impulsiveness: (1) attentional impulsiveness, defined as the (in-)ability to concentrate or focus attention, (2) motor impulsiveness, the propensity to act without thinking, and (3) non-planning impulsiveness, or the lack of planning the future and forethought. In the current paper, the difference between the total score for each group was used to describe differences in impulsiveness. For an overview of different clinical scores of BIS-11 the reader is kindly asked to look at Stanford et al. [ ]. \n\n\n### 2.3. Imaging Parameters and Processing \n  \nSince not all participants fulfilled the criteria to be examined with MRI (e.g., because of claustrophobia or having a pacemaker) only subgroups of the sample were included in the measurements. Therefore, the analysis of the Go/No-go paradigm included 23 non-convicted CSOs and 38 CSOs convicted participants instead of the overall 31 non-convicted CSOs and 48 convicted CSOs. \n\nThe MRI images were acquired at five separate 3T MRI scanners that were equipped with 32 channel head coils: 2\u00d7 Siemens Skyra, 2\u00d7 Siemens Trio and 1\u00d7 Phillips Achiva. T1 images were created by means of MPRAGE sequence (slices = 192, FoV = 256 mm, voxel size = 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm, TR = 2.500 ms, TE = 4.37 ms, flip angle = 7, distance factor = 50%). T2 weighted images were gained using an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (slices = 38, field of view = 240 mm, voxel size = 2.3 \u00d7 2.3 \u00d7 3 mm, time of repetition = 2.400 ms, echo time 30 ms, flip angle = 80, distance factor = 10%). MRI phantom stability measures [ ] were accompanied to prevent signal fluctuations across all sites. For functional imaging analysis, the Statistical Parametric Mapping Software (SPM 12) [ ] was used. The first five images were discarded to account for T1 relaxation effects. Before statistical analysis, functional volumes were (1) slice time corrected using the middle slice as reference, (2) realigned and unwarped, (3) co-registered to the according T1 image, (4) spatially normalized into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space utilizing the individual T1 image and (5) smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel (full width half maximum of 8 mm). \n\nGo/nogo task: As a measure of impulse control and behavioral inhibition participants performed an event-related go/nogo task preceded by an alertness task of go-trials. The alertness task was applied to allow the participant to familiarize with the MRI environment as well as to provide a baseline measure for reaction time to a simple target stimulus. The projection screen was localized either in front (Hanover) or behind the magnet bore (Berlin, Essen, Kiel). At first, an instruction was presented which informed the participants to respond as fast as possible to any presented stimulus indicated by \u201cX\u201d. Afterwards, the stimulus presentation of 50 alertness trials was initiated. Next, a second instruction screen followed introducing the go/nogo condition containing 150 trials. Participants were asked to respond as fast as possible to frequently presented go-trials (80% indicated by \u201cX\u201d) and withhold the response to infrequently presented no-go trials (20% indicated by \u201c+\u201d). Stimuli were presented using Presentation Software package (Neurobehavioral Systems, Berkeley, CA, USA) and were shown in a pseudo-randomized order, precluding the occurrence of two repeatedly presented no-go stimuli. Stimuli were presented 200 ms with an inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) of 1500\u20132500 ms. Before scanning, participants were instructed to respond with the right forefinger to the response box. The number of commission errors of no-go trials as well as the reaction times of alertness were used for further statistical analysis to provide a behavioral measure of response inhibition. Outliers differing more than threefold from the distance between the 25% and 75% percentile of the distribution were excluded from analysis. Visual impairments were corrected by a goggle system that was compatible with MR. \n\n\n### 2.4. Statistical Analysis \n  \nBehavioral analysis: SPSS version 24 [ ] was used for statistical analysis. To distinguish effects between non-convicted CSOs and convicted CSOs with respect to intelligence, clinical characteristics, empathy, impulsiveness, childhood trauma, victim characteristics, and biographical information,   t  -tests were used for interval data and Chi  tests for dichotomous data. Since the study is part of the NeMUP project there was no specialized sample size calculation for this particular paper. However, the sample size for the whole NeMUP research was calculated for each of the four groups that were included in research (pedophiles with child sexual abuse, pedophiles without child sexual abuse. child sexual abusers without pedophilia and controls). For group one which was included in the current paper, there was a sample size calculation of 60 participants to ensure MRI results were measurable. Concerning non-convicted pedophiles, there are only to papers known by the authors that integrated non-convicted pedophiles into their research. Beier et al. [ ] included 53 pedophiles and 22 control participants in his design. Engel et al. [ ] included 35 treated pedophiles and 51 treatment refusers in his analysis. For that reason, the sample size of the current paper stands in line with other research published on this topic. \n\nIn order to correct for multiple testing, Bonferroni\u2013Holm correction was implemented for different subgroups. Subgroups were: Characteristics of the offender, clinical information, experienced childhood trauma, characteristics of the victims, delict specifics, history of delicts (except hands-on delicts) as well as sexual problems and paraphilias. In order to determine if the number of delicts could be associated with other (sexual) characteristics of the offender, correlations between sexual age preference, sexual gender preference, and quantity of sexual child offenses were included in the analysis. In   subgroups are described in more detail as well as their descriptive statistic parameters. \n\nFor behavioral data of go/nogo paradigm, reaction time, error rate and error quote were analyzed using two sample   t  -tests. \n\nfMRI analysis: SPM12 was used to analyze functional volumes. For first-level analysis the following events were included as regressors in the design matrix: (1) alertness, (2) hits to go-trials, (3) false responses to no-go trials, (4) false responses to no-go trials (commission errors), (5) movement as regressors of no interest. Event-related responses were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response (HRF), and separate linear contrast images (vectors for each condition) were built. For assessing group differences, contrast images were analyzed using two-sided   t  -tests (non-convicted CSOs vs. convicted CSOs) between groups for the different regressors of interest: (1) alertness, (2) go-trials, (3) successfully inhibited no-go trials and (4) false responses to no-go trials (commission errors). Groups neither differed in age nor IQ so these variables were of no interest for further analysis. The threshold for all analyses was set to   p   = 0.05, familywise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Characteristics of the Offender \n  \nAs shown in  , no significant differences could be found which distinguished between the two offender groups concerning age or intelligence (neither in relation to general, verbal nor performance intelligence). Moreover, measurements for empathy or impulsiveness did not separate between non-convicted and convicted CSOs. No correlation between sexual age preference, sexual gender preference, and quantity of sexual child offenses was seen. \n\n\n### 3.2. Sexuality \n  \nNon-convicted and convicted CSOs differed in sexual age orientation \u03c7  (1,   n   =   79  ) = 14.00,   p   = 0.03. Convicted CSOs were more often pedophilic (  n   = 19 convicted,   n   = 5 non-convicted) or mixed pedophilic/teleiophilic (  n   = 11 convicted,   n   = 5 non-convicted), whereas non-convicted CSOs showed an age preference more often than mixed hebephilic/teleiophilic (  n   = 3 convicted,   n   = 11 non-convicted). There was no difference in sexual gender orientation \u03c7  (1,   n   =   79  ) = 4.01,   p   = 0.135). \n\n\n### 3.3. Experienced Childhood Trauma \n  \nThere were no significant differences in self-experienced childhood traumatization as assessed by the CTQ questionnaire between non-convicted and convicted CSOs. A more detailed overview of the data can be found in  . \n\n\n### 3.4. Clinical Information \n  \nAs can be seen in  , no significant difference was found between the two groups concerning any clinical features. \n\n\n### 3.5. Delinquency \n  \nCSO delicts: Non-convicted CSOs and convicted CSOs differed in the quantity of their sexual child offenses (  t (78)   = \u22124.23,   p   < 0.001), but not in the number of victims or in the number of victims by gender. A marginal significance for a difference in the number of male victims was evident (  t (78)   = \u22122.32,   p   = 0.06). There was neither a correlation between sexual age preference and quantity of sexual child offenses nor between sexual gender preference and quantity of sexual child offenses. \n\nNon-CSO delicts: As can be seen in  , the two groups did not differ concerning delicts other than child sexual offending. \n\n\n### 3.6. Victims\u2019 Characteristics \n  \nThe groups showed a marginal significance in the difference of age of female victims (  t (78)   = \u22122.51,   p   = 0.06). \n\n\n### 3.7. Go/No-Go Task \n  \nNon-convicted and convicted CSOs did not significantly differ in this task, neither in post-error slowing nor in reaction times to commission errors. For detailed information see  . \n\n\n### 3.8. fMRI Analysis \n  \nSuccessful response-inhibition activated clusters in the anterior cingulate cortex, supplemental motor cortex, insula and middle temporal gyrus (FWE corrected on voxel level, see  ) for both groups. No differences were found between both groups. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nOverall, only subtle differences between non-convicted and convicted CSOs were identified. Thus, most of the initial hypotheses of the authors concerning differences between convicted and non-convicted pedophilic offenders could not be supported. Data shows that non-convicted CSOs were neither more intelligent nor less impulsive nor suffered less from psychiatric disorders than convicted CSOs in this study. Additionally, no differences could be found concerning their age, the number of victims or the level of empathy. Interestingly, convicted CSOs committed more delicts than non-convicted CSOs. Furthermore, non-convicted and convicted CSOs differed in sexual age orientation. Moreover, all hypotheses except age and gender preference concerning characteristics of victims could not be supported in the present study. However, there was a marginal significance concerning the number of male victims and the age of female victims. \n\nOur data shows that the risk of being caught increases with the number of victims. First, it is likely that with an increasing number of delicts it becomes more probable that one victim is able to identify the offender or to confide in another person about the crime. Second, more frequent delicts of child sexual offending may increase hubris of the offender and lead to carelessness concerning the crime scene, which may finally lead to the offender\u2019s incarceration. \n\nSince convicted CSOs were more often exclusively pedophilic or mixed pedophilic/teleiophilic it is possible that harming a child might lead more often to incarceration than harming an adolescent. This might be due to the social perspective that harming adolescents might be less harmful. Additionally, there is an ongoing debate about whether or not hebephilia is relevant for psychopathology [ ]. This debate has been consistent with the evolutionary psychology position that emphasizing the adaptive partner-preference is for fecund females (although females are actually subfecund for one to two years after menarche) [ , ]. Hence it is possible, that mixed hebephilic/teleiphilic preference\u2014which has been shown more often in the group of non-convicted CSOs\u2014will be longer \u201cbelow radar level\u201d than pedophilic preference. However, since the following data is cross-sectional no causal connections are possible. \n\nThe present data suggest that incarceration effects are not as prominent as often stated in criticisms about research with convicted subjects. The general criticism that it is difficult or even impossible to interpret data gained by imprisoned groups exclusively can subsequently be put into another perspective. Nonetheless, it is important to keep incarceration effects, environmental effects, and the effect of critical life events such as being convicted in mind. \n\nRelating to the aim of the study to find differences between both groups which might help to decrease the number of CSOs and\u2014more importantly\u2014undetected CSOs, the difference in the number of delicts between non-convicted CSOs and convicted CSOs actually is of high relevance. However, it is important not to interpret the results as a causal relationship between the number of delicts that would lead to incarceration or not. \n\nThe presented data is in line with findings from Neutze et al. [ ], showing more group similarities than differences between detected and undetected offenders altogether. \n\nAdditionally, the present study compared \u2018resulting\u2019 factors of convicted CSOs and non-convicted CSOs. \u201cPreceding\u201d factors are defined as the ones that might influence whether an individual is detected (e.g., age or education) whereas (2) \u201cresulting\u201d ones may either be a response to detection (e.g., emotion-oriented coping, childhood sexual victimization) or reflect a bias in self-report measures (e.g., sexual self-regulation problems, paraphilic interests) in order to avoid negative consequences (e.g., severe punishment). Differences which have been described between convicted and non-convicted CSOs concerning age and education in the study of Neutze et al. [ ] (non-convicted CSOs were younger) [ ], were not replicated in the present study. Furthermore, the report of suffering more from own childhood victimization in the group of convicted CSO [ ] was observable as a marginal significance in the present study. Therefore, the two different sets of factors, proposed by Neutze et al. [ ], that are associated with detection status were not observed in the present study. Overall, future research should address these factors. \n\nThe consequences of child sexual offending are, as already mentioned, fatal and costly for society (the estimated lifetime economic burden of CSO is approximately $9.3 billion in the US [ ]) as well as for children\u2019s wellbeing and development [ , , ]. Additionally, the devastating effect may persist until adulthood. Thus, emphasis should be laid on preventing offenses. Due to a lack of confidentiality regulations in many countries, offering therapy is only possible after incarceration, i.e., after the crime has not to be concealed anymore. Since therapy may decrease the risk of committing another crime by focusing on dynamic risk factors of offending [ ], offering a therapeutic concept to non-convicted CSOs may not only decrease the number of delicts, but it may also reduce the socioeconomic burden and increase the well-being of children. Future research should focus on how preventive approaches may help to reduce the number of offenses. \n\nHowever, to go one step further offering therapy to non-convicted CSOs might raise the concern that treating this group could lead to better \u201cskills\u201d in hiding crimes and criminal behavior. By working on topics such as behavioral control, social skills, and empathy, non-convicted CSOs might not only learn how to hide a crime better, they may also be able to get better in contacting children and\u2014if so\u2014therapy of non-convicted CSOs might theoretically actively exaggerate the risk of (re)offending. Furthermore, there is a wide discussion in society whether or not offender treatment does more harm than good [ , ]. However, since it is shown in the present study that non-convicted CSOs and convicted CSOs seem to suffer from comparable psychiatric burdens and difficulties, it is unlikely that they will learn skills which may increase their risk of offending. Regarding the fact that detected and undetected CSOs do not differ in clinical characteristics, there is no reason for withholding therapy from undetected CSOs. Moreover, Beier et al. [ ] showed that therapy in the German \u201cDunkelfeld\u201d (dark field) project altered dynamic risk factors for child sexual offending and reduced related behaviors. This knowledge is fundamental to ensure the protection and wellbeing of children and to uncover child sexual abuse as early as possible. \n\n\n## 5. Limitations \n  \nFirst of all, participants were recruited as part of the multi-site research project NeMUP, which includes five collaborative research sites from (forensic) psychiatry or sexual medicine located in Berlin, Bochum/Essen, Hanover, Kiel and Magdeburg and did not only include convicted and non-convicted CSOs but also healthy controls and \u201chands-off\u201d pedophiles who have not committed a crime yet. There were several exclusion criteria which were important for other investigations in the NeMUP consortium but might limit generalizing the results of this study. Those were an intellectual disability, psychotic disorder, current severe major depressive disorder (score greater than 15 on the Hamilton Depression Scale) or anxiety disorder (score greater than 25 in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale), clinically predominant substance misuse or dependence and any psychotropic medication. Subsequently, it is possible that differences between CSOs and non-convicted CSOs vanished not because differences did not exist but because of the early exclusion of offenders with a high psychiatric burden. Future research should include participants with current mental disorders and a high psychiatric burden to ensure differences are not disappearing due to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Additionally, the questions asked on recruitment might lead to possible bias such as not detecting pedophiles who are ashamed of \u201ccoming out\u201d with their sexual preference or not integrating participants with a high psychiatric burden due to exclusion criteria. Since a large number of participants has been recruited within the \u201cDon\u2019t offend\u201d-network this might represent another bias because these subjects are all motivated to undergo psychotherapy. \n\nAnother difficulty in the study is the missing detailed data about the crime itself and the crime scene. Due to our quantitative approach, we were not able to include this data as well. However, it is indeed possible that circumstances of the crime and the crime scene are a certain factor for leading to conviction or non-conviction. Circumstances such as sadism or threatening the victim were not included in the analysis. These factors may be important not only for the likelihood of reporting the crime but also for the effort of engaged third parties such as social workers and/or the police. The topic of circumstances of the crime should be taken into consideration for future research. The following paper focuses on the characteristics of the offenders and only a few characteristics of the victims. Since each and every crime has its own characteristics and specifics, it is difficult to investigate the circumstances of a crime by using quantitative research. Concerning alterations in the characteristics of convicted in comparison to non-convicted CSOs, the study only included pedophilic CSOs who are either known by the judicial system, and therefore, convicted or are in the so-called \u201cdark field\u201d. \n\nMoreover, the reliance on self-report concerning detection status of non-convicted CSOs might be a problem for analysis. Future research has to find a way of limiting the risk of false-negative responses by the participants due to the possible withholding of information in virtue of shame for being detected. Another limitation is the confinement of the study sample to individuals who applied voluntarily. For that reason, it is possible that differences or similarities between help-seeking offenders and those not seeking help\u2014independent of detection status\u2014may not have been targeted. \n\nNevertheless, the study design is cross-sectional, and causal connections are therefore prohibited. \n\nFinally, including measurements for socially desirable responding to the procedure of collecting data would be appreciated. \n\n\n## 6. Concluding Remark \n  \nThe study shows effects on a marginally significant level for the number of victims, number of male victims, age of female victims, and self-reported sexual abuse. Additionally, a significant effect for the number of sexual offenses was shown. Hence, convicted CSOs may represent a specific subsample with higher risk and a greater burden of adverse life events though differences appear to be smaller than commonly perceived. The main strength of this study is that it is one of the first focusing on differences between detected and undetected CSOs. Until now, there is only one other study [ ] known by the authors that tried to understand which factors may play an important role in the incarceration of CSOs. Because of its design, the study was able to examine differences between those groups. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: jcm-08-00947-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tNon-Convicted CSOs (n = 31)\tNon-Convicted CSOs (n = 31)\tNon-Convicted CSOs (n = 31)\tNon-Convicted CSOs (n = 31)\tConvicted CSOs (n = 43)\tConvicted CSOs (n = 43)\tConvicted CSOs (n = 43)\tConvicted CSOs (n = 43)\tT\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tM\tSD\tMinimum\tMaximum\tM\tSD\tMinimum\tMaximum\tT\nOffender characteristics\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAge\t40.4\t10.8\t20.0\t59.0\t39.8\t9.0\t24.0\t62.0\t0.27\nIntelligence (WAIS)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEstimated general IQ\t100.26\t18.51\t62.0\t140.0\t98.27\t18.95\t66.0\t166.0\t0.46\nEstimated verbal IQ\t95.00\t21.52\t54.0\t137.0\t92.14\t17.45\t57.0\t129.0\t0.65\nEstimated performance IQ\t106.87\t19.41\t78.0\t143.0\t103.31\t17.29\t63.0\t149.0\t0.85\nEmpathy (MET)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEmotional\t5.11\t1.25\t2.65\t7.44\t5.33\t1.74\t1.44\t8.11\t\u22120.57\nCognitive\t6.98\t1.02\t4.63\t9.0\t7.10\t1.04\t3.88\t8.5\t\u22120.49\nImpulsiveness (BIS-11)\t64.46\t9.86\t47.0\t81.0\t63.49\t8.59\t46.0\t88.0\t0.44\nFamily background\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nExperienced childhood trauma (CTQ)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEmotional abuse\t11.20\t4.9\t5.0\t23.0\t10.24\t5.41\t5.0\t25.0\t0.79\nSexual abuse\t7.00\t2.45\t5.0\t14.0\t9.48\t6.34\t5.0\t25.0\t\u22122.40\nPhysical abuse\t7.70\t3.37\t5.0\t20.0\t8.43\t4.71\t5.0\t22.0\t\u22120.74\nEmotional neglect\t13.20\t4.91\t5.0\t25.0\t12.37\t4.57\t5.0\t25.0\t0.75\nPhysical neglect\t7.60\t2.9\t5.0\t17.0\t7.85\t3.05\t5.0\t20.0\t\u22120.35\nInformation about the victims\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAge (mean)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFemale victim\t10.50\t3.19\t5.0\t15.5\t8.68\t2.31\t5.0\t13.0\t2.15\nMale victim\t11.28\t2.59\t6.0\t15.0\t10.18\t2.48\t3.0\t14.5\t\u22120.25\nHistory of Delicts (except hands-on Delicts)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nQuantity of violent offense\t0.13\t0.43\t0.0\t2.0\t0.66\t1.23\t0.0\t2.0\t0.125\nQuantity of other offenses\t0.83\t1.23\t0.0\t5.0\t0.55\t1.23\t0.0\t7.0\t\u22120.28\nDelict specifics\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nQuantity of child sexual offenses\t1.94\t1.41\t1.0\t7.0\t4.53\t3.91\t1.0\t17.0\t\u22124.23 ***\nNumber of victims\t2.35\t2.53\t1.0\t11.0\t5.08\t8.71\t1.0\t60.0\t0.39\nNumber of female victims\t1.58\t2.59\t0.0\t11.0\t1.33\t2.13\t0.0\t10.0\t0.48\nNumber of male victims\t0.77\t1.43\t0.0\t7.0\t3.76\t8.81\t0.0\t60.0\t\u22122.32\n\tna\t\t\t\tna\t\t\t\t\u03c72\nClinical diagnoses\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSCID I disorders\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAffective disorders\t13\t\t\t\t16\t\t\t\t0.40\nAnxiety disorders\t8\t\t\t\t9\t\t\t\t0.63\nSexual disorders\t0\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t1.60\nObsessive compulsive disorders\t1\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t0.11\nSubstance disorders\t6\t\t\t\t12\t\t\t\t0.29\nEating disorders\t0\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t0.64\nADHD\t1\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t1.60\nSCID II disorders\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0.91\nCluster A\t2\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t0.00\nCluster B\t11\t\t\t\t10\t\t\t\t2.22\nCluster C\t6\t\t\t\t12\t\t\t\t0.29\nSexual age orientation\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t14.00 *\nHebephile\t1\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\nPedophile\t5\t\t\t\t19\t\t\t\t\nMixed pedophile and teleiophile\t5\t\t\t\t11\t\t\t\t\nMixed hebephile and teleiophile\t11\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\nMixed pedophile and hebephile\t5\t\t\t\t5\t\t\t\t\nMixed pedophile, hebephile and teleiophile\t4\t\t\t\t8\t\t\t\t\nSexual gender orientation\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4.01\nHeterosexual\t17\t\t\t\t17\t\t\t\t\nHomosexual\t8\t\t\t\t23\t\t\t\t\nBisexual\t6\t\t\t\t9\t\t\t\t\nIntrafamilial (incest) delicts\t7\t\t\t\t6\t\t\t\t1.49\nExtrafamilial delicts\t24\t\t\t\t43\t\t\t\t1.49\n### Caption\nCharacteristics of non-convicted and convicted child sexual offenders (CSOs).\n### Footer\nM: Mean, SD: standard deviation, a number of participants fulfilling the criteria, * p \u2264 0.05, *** p \u2264 0.001.\n\n\n## ID: jcm-08-00947-t002\n### Label: Table 2\nUnnamed: 0\tNon-Convicted CSOs (n = 31)\tConvicted CSOs (n = 49)\tStatistics (t-Value)\nRT Alertness in ms, M (SD)\t263.009 (58.269)\t273.540 (47.545)\tt (78) = \u22120.74;

Levels of depression, anxiety, obsessive\u2013compulsive symptoms and eating disorder behaviour were obtained and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to acquire uncorrelated variables. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nfMRI analysis revealed a greater blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response in AN in the right fusiform gyrus to all facial expressions. This response showed a linear increase with the happiness of the facial expression and was found to be stronger in those not taking medication. PCA analysis revealed a single component indicating a greater level of general clinical symptoms. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nNeuroimaging findings would suggest that alterations in implicit emotion processing in AN occur during early perceptual processing of social signals and illustrate greater engagement on the FEPT. The lack of separate components using PCA suggests that the questionnaires used might not be suited as predictive measures. \n\n   Highlights  \n  \nGreater BOLD response in AN in the right fusiform gyrus to all facial expressions. \n  \nThe BOLD response showed a linear increase with the happiness of the expression \n  \nThe BOLD response was stronger in those not taking psychotropic medication \n  \nThese alterations occur during early perceptual processing of social signals \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAnorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder primarily affecting young women and is associated with the highest levels of social impairment and lifetime suicidality amongst all eating disorders ( ,  ) as well as one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder ( ). Character traits such as negative emotionality (affect and attitudes), harm avoidance and perfectionism have been reported both in children who later develop AN as well as in long-term recovered patients and may contribute to the development of AN ( ). Similarly, several studies have reported the onset of an anxiety disorder before the onset of an eating disorder, with a large number endorsing a social phobia ( ,  ). \n\nOver 55% of AN patients have at least one comorbid disorder and this may explain some of the heterogeneity commonly observed in the AN population ( ,  ). Current literature on the impact of such comorbid disorders is not clear, with some studies reporting no impact ( ), while others report significantly poorer outcome in the presence of comorbidity ( ,  ). Another issue is whether this purely affects an individual's general psychosocial functioning or if it has an effect on the pathology of AN ( ,  ,  ). \n\nResearch in psychosocial functioning has shown higher levels of alexithymia ( ,  ,  ), social anhedonia ( ) and poor work and social adjustment ( ) in AN compared to healthy controls (HC). Previous experimental studies assessing emotion processing have found that individuals with AN show poor emotion recognition and are slower to respond in emotion identification tasks ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). These results are not fully conclusive, as other earlier studies using similar experimental paradigms don't match these findings ( ,  ). One of the possible confounding factors in these observations is the high comorbidity of AN with affective disorders, which have also been associated with impaired emotion processing ( ,  ). Previous studies using facial expression processing tasks (FEPT) have attributed the differences in accuracy and misclassifications in AN to self-reported levels of depression ( ), obsessive compulsive symptoms ( ) and anxiety ( ). \n\nThe onset of AN often occurs during adolescence ( ), a developmental period associated with changes in social cognition which is paralleled with changes in brain regions associated with social function ( ).   proposed a   Social Information Processing Network   (SIPN) which is made up of three basic nodes; a detecting node, an affective node and a cognitive-regulatory node. Disturbances in the   affective node   (amygdala, hypothalamus, ventral striatum, septum, orbitofrontal cortex and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) and the   cognitive-regulatory node   (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and ventral prefrontal cortex) during adolescence could lead to mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. The   detecting node   (fusiform face area, superior temporal sulcus and anterior temporal lobe), which is already mature before adolescence, has been linked to early developmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) ( ,  ,  ). Previous behavioural literature has suggested similarities in the psychosocial profiles of AN and ASD ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and   hypothesised that, similarly to what happens in ASD, a hyperactive amygdala may mediate hypoactivation of the fusiform gyrus and of the superior temporal sulcus in AN, leading to a social attentional bias   away   from faces (i.e. avoidance of emotional experience ( ,  ,  )). This would express itself in the avoidance of faces ( ,  ,  ,  ) as well as in the absence of congruent facial expressions ( ). However, other studies have either not found this bias ( ), or actually reported an attentional bias   to   facial expressions ( ,  ). \n\nFunctional and structural neuroimaging studies have reported alterations in the   detecting node   ( ,  ,  ) and   reported disrupted functional connectivity in AN in the ventral stream of visual processing. However, none of these studies focused on psychosocial functioning in AN. Recently, recovered AN patients were found to show no significant difference in activation in the fusiform gyrus or in the amygdala to sad or happy facial expressions ( ). This might suggest that alterations in these regions during emotion processing are state dependent and only present during illness. \n\nTo date, most studies of psychosocial functioning in AN patients have revealed impaired performance and neuroimaging studies have reported both functional and structural changes in regions implicated within the SIPN. However, there is no literature on the underlying brain activity associated with the processing of social signals in ill state. Furthermore, the question remains whether or not the impairment is solely attributable to the pathology of AN, or if it is linked to commonly present comorbid disorders. The aim of this study was thus to assess the neural correlates of implicit emotion processing in AN using a whole-brain approach. Additionally, we explored the effects of confounding factors, such as comorbidity within the affective spectrum and psychotropic medication, on emotion processing in AN. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA total of sixty-six female participants took part in this study. Thirty-one individuals with a current diagnosis of AN according to DSM-IV criteria were recruited from the hospital and community services of the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) National Health Service Trust and from an online advertisement on the b-eat website (Beating Eating Disorders \u2014 ), the UK's largest eating disorder charity (inpatients\u00a0=\u00a09, outpatients\u00a0=\u00a08, daycare patients\u00a0=\u00a07, community\u00a0=\u00a07). Twenty-five (81%) were diagnosed as restrictive (AN-R) and six (19%) as binge-purging (AN-BP). Fourteen (45%) reported taking antidepressant (SSRI\u00a0=\u00a012, SNRI\u00a0=\u00a01) or anti-anxiety medication. Thirty-five age-matched healthy individuals with no personal or family history of eating disorders were recruited from the community, staff and students of the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. Two healthy participants were excluded from further analysis due to currently taking antidepressant medication and two were excluded for optimal matching of the two groups in terms of age and IQ. Body mass index  , medication, age of onset and duration of illness were obtained on the day of testing. The screening module of the research version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM disorders (SCID-I/P) ( ) was used as a screening tool for the healthy controls (HC). The National Adult Reading Test (NART) was used to estimate IQ ( ). Participants consent was obtained according to the Declaration of Helsinki (BMJ 1991; 302: 1194) and was approved by the National Research Ethics Committee London Bentham (11-LO-0952). \n\n\n### Clinical measures \n  \nAll participants completed a range of questionnaires before attending the scanning session to assess levels of anxiety, depression, eating disorder-related behaviour, obsessive compulsive symptoms and social anhedonia. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) ( ) consists of 14 items used to assess the overall severity of depression and anxiety. Its performance in screening for anxiety and depression has been proven and it has been shown to also have good case finding abilities in non-clinical populations ( ). For both subscales, a score of 10 is used as a clinical threshold. The Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) ( ) is a self-report questionnaire, consisting of 36 items, that looks at a participants' behaviour over the past 28\u00a0days, with scores ranging from 4 to 6 indicating greater clinical severity. The Obsessive\u2013Compulsive Inventory Revised (OCI-R) ( ) is an 18-item list of first person statements that participants have to rate according to the level of distress they felt when they experienced those statements over the past month. The OCI-R has shown good internal consistency and test\u2013retest reliability, and it is able to discriminate between OCD sufferers, anxious controls and non-anxious controls. A total score higher than 20 is used as a cut-off for optimal discrimination with non-anxious controls. The Revised Social Anhedonia Scale (R-SAS) ( ) is a 40-item list of statements that participants can either agree or disagree with, and it is widely used in psychiatric research to identify social anhedonic individuals ( ,  ,  ). A total score above the optimal cut-off score of 12 is used to identify social anhedonic individuals ( ). \n\n\n### Implicit facial emotion processing task (I-FEPT) \n  \nA series of photographs of 10 different faces devoid of any gender specific details (4 males and 6 females) taken from a standardised series ( ) was used as stimuli. These faces portrayed a neutral expression (100% neutral), a prototypical happy expression (100% happy) or a morphed, mildly happy expression (50% neutral and 50% happy). All three facial expressions were presented a total of 20 times for 2\u00a0s each in the same order to all participants. Each facial expression was preceded by the other two expressions an equal amount of times to minimise any effect of the preceding facial expression on current neural response. The duration of the inter stimulus interval (ISI) ranged from 1 to 7\u00a0s (average of 3\u00a0s) and was fixed according to a Poisson distribution to prevent participants from predicting the onset of the next stimulus. Participants used a joystick to specify the gender of the face during each presentation, and they were asked to focus on a fixation cross during the ISI. Stimuli were projected on a rear-projection screen and participants could view the screen via a prism attached to the head coil. \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nMagnetic resonance imaging was performed using a 1.5\u00a0T GE Signa HDx TwinSpeed MRI scanner (GE-Medical Systems, Wisconsin) at the Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. The body coil was used for radio frequency (RF) transmission, with an 8 channel head coil for RF reception. A high resolution EPI scan, to be used for fMRI data normalisation, was acquired at 43 near-axial 3\u00a0mm thick slices parallel to the anterior commissure\u2013posterior commissure (AC\u2013PC) line (echo time 40\u00a0ms, repetition time 3000\u00a0ms, flip angle 90\u00b0, in-plane voxel size 1.88\u00a0mm, inter-slice gap .3\u00a0mm, field of view 240\u00a0mm, matrix size 128\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0128\u00a0pixels). T2*-weighted gradient echo EPI images depicting blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast were acquired at 25 near-axial slices, 5\u00a0mm thick, parallel to the AC\u2013PC line (echo time 40\u00a0ms, repetition time 2000\u00a0ms, flip angle 70\u00b0, in-plane voxel size 3.75\u00a0mm, inter-slice gap .5\u00a0mm, field of view 240\u00a0mm, matrix size 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064 pixels). A total of 180 T2*-weighted whole brain volumes were acquired for each participant. Data quality was assured using an automated quality control procedure ( ). \n\n\n### Behavioural data analysis \n  \nDemographic, clinical and performance data were analysed using IBM SPSS version 20 (IBM  ). Data normality was assessed using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test. Where data were normally distributed, the Student t-test was used to examine between-group differences. For non-normal data, the non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used. With regard to correlations, Pearson's   r   was used for normally distributed data and Spearman's rho (\u03c1) otherwise. \n\nDue to multicollinearity amongst self-report measures, a principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to find a subset of the questionnaires that was uncorrelated with each other to control for comorbidities. Bartlett's test of sphericity, Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin measure of sampling adequacy, and whether each variable showed at least a medium-sized correlation with at least one other variable were used to test the PCA assumptions. Components with an eigenvalue greater than one were selected. \n\n\n### Neuroimaging data analysis \n  \nImaging data were analysed with XBAM version 4.1 ( ), a non-parametric fMRI software package developed at the King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry ( ). Data were first processed to minimise motion related artefacts ( ) and, following spatial realignment, images were smoothed with an 8.83\u00a0mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian filter. \n\nResponses to each condition were then detected by time-series analysis using a linear model in which each component of the experimental design was convolved separately with a pair of Gamma Variate kernels (\u03bb\u00a0=\u00a04 and 8\u00a0s) to allow for variability in the haemodynamic delay. The best fit between the weighted sum of these convolutions and the time-series at each voxel was computed using the constrained BOLD effect model ( ). A goodness of fit statistic was then computed as the ratio of the sum of squares of deviations from the mean image intensity resulting from the model (over the whole time-series) to the sum of squares of deviations resulting from the residuals (SSQ ratio). \n\nFollowing computation of the observed SSQ ratio at each voxel, the data were permuted by the wavelet-based method described in  . The observed and permuted SSQ ratio maps for each individual were then transformed into the standard space of  , using a two-stage warping procedure ( ). Group maps of activated voxels were then computed using the median SSQ ratio at each voxel (over all individuals) in the observed and permuted maps ( ). Computing intra and inter participant variations constitute a mixed effect approach, which is desirable in fMRI. The detection of activated regions was extended from voxel to 3D cluster-level using the method described by  . \n\nComparisons of responses between-groups at each condition and comparisons of responses between-conditions for each group separately were performed by fitting the data at each intracerebral voxel at which all participants have non-zero data using the linear model where \u2018Y\u2019 is the vector of SSQ ratios for each individual, \u2018X\u2019 is the contrast matrix for the inter-group/inter-condition contrast, \u2018a\u2019 is the mean effect across all individuals in the groups/conditions, \u2018b\u2019 is the computed group/condition difference and \u2018e\u2019 is a vector of residual errors. The model is fitted by minimising the sum of absolute deviations to reduce outlier effects. The null distribution of \u2018b\u2019 is computed by permuting data between-groups/conditions, refitting the above model a maximum of 50 times at each voxel, and combining the data over all intracerebral voxels. To contrast the different facial expressions, linear and quadratic trends for emotion intensity were fitted at each voxel for all individuals in the two groups and the same process of wavelet-based resampling to derive the observed and null distributions was performed. A linear trend was fitted to identify voxels that demonstrate an increase in activation for increasing emotion intensity (happy\u00a0>\u00a0mildly happy\u00a0>\u00a0neutral). A quadratic trend (happy\u00a0>\u00a0mildly happy\u00a0>\u00a0neutral) was fitted to validate the linear relation of the response to the increasing emotional intensities. Using the derived null distribution, all resulting 3D cluster-level maps were then thresholded in such a way as to yield less than one expected type I error cluster per map. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Clinical measures \n  \nThere was a significant difference between the AN and HC mean scores on the EDE-Q, the OCI-R, the R-SAS and the HADS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), as depicted in  . On the EDE-Q, 83.9% of the AN group scored above the optimal point for distinguishing between HC and cases of AN (>\u00a02.80). Within this group, 51.6% had a score lower than four on the EDE-Q. For the OCI-R, the proportion of individuals in the AN group with a total score higher than twenty-one was 48.4%. Across the AN group, 53.3% had a score above twelve on the R-SAS. For the HADS depression (HADS_D) and anxiety (HADS_A) subscales, 51.6% and 87.1% respectively, had a score of ten or higher.   \nClinical and demographic characteristics. \n          \n\n\n### Principal component analysis \n  \nPrincipal component analysis revealed a single component with an eigenvalue greater than one. This component contained all five questionnaires and reflects a greater amount of general clinical symptoms, thereby excluding the possibility of covarying separate clinical measures ( ).   \nCorrelation coefficients for the relationship between depression, anxiety, obsessionality, social anhedonia and eating disorder symptomology variables. \n  \n\n\n### Behavioural measures \n  \nBoth groups showed high accuracy on gender decision in the implicit facial expression recognition task and there was a significant difference between the two (see  ). The AN patients were slower on the task across all conditions and there was no significant difference in reaction time to the different emotions within both groups.   \nReaction time and gender decision accuracy on the I-FEPT overall as well as reaction time per emotional intensity. \n      \n\nTo assess whether the differences were due to medication, the AN group was divided into two subgroups depending on the presence of psychotropic medication (Supplementary Table 1). There was no significant difference in reaction time for all three facial expressions, but those taking psychotropic medication (AN-M) were less accurate (91.6%) than those not taking medication (AN-NM) (97.5%) and this difference was significant (U\u00a0=\u00a056.5, z\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.504, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012). \n\n\n### Neuroimaging results \n  \n#### Linear trend analysis \n  \nLinear trends were fitted to assess regions that expressed an increase in activation to an increase in emotional intensity in facial expressions (happy\u00a0>\u00a0mildly happy\u00a0>\u00a0neutral). A group x condition interaction was found, showing greater activation in the right fusiform gyrus, extending into the occipital lobe, in AN compared to HC ( a,  ).   \nDifferences in BOLD response on the I-FEPT for AN (red) and HC (blue) for a) linear trend analysis where happy\u00a0>\u00a0mildly happy\u00a0>\u00a0neutral facial expressions (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006, FDR Corrected), b) neutral facial expressions (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009, FDR Corrected), c) mildly happy facial expressions (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, FDR Corrected), and d) prototypical happy facial expressions (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, FDR Corrected). \n    \nSignificant clusters of activation on the I-FEPT. Coordinates are those of the peak voxels and are in standard space of Talairach and Tournoux. \n  \n\nPost-hoc comparisons were made in which each facial expression was contrasted with a low-level baseline (fixation cross) and between-group comparisons (AN vs. HC) were made for each facial expression. \n\n\n#### Neutral facial expressions \n  \nIndividuals with AN demonstrated greater activation in the bilateral fusiform gyrus, left postcentral gyrus and bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus whereas HC showed greater activation in the right lingual gyrus extending into the posterior cingulate gyrus during presentation of neutral facial expressions ( b,  ). \n\n\n#### Mildly happy facial expressions \n  \nThe HC group had greater activation in the posterior cingulate gyrus (extending into the cuneus and lingual gyrus) while the AN group showed greater activation in the bilateral fusiform gyrus (extending into the middle occipital cortex) and left postcentral gyrus ( c,  ). \n\n\n#### Prototypical happy facial expressions \n  \nDuring prototypical happy facial expressions the AN group showed greater activation in the right fusiform gyrus and the left precentral gyrus compared to HC ( d,  ). No regions were found to be significant for the reverse contrast. \n\n\n#### Exploratory effects of medication \n  \nThe initial trend analysis was repeated within the AN group to assess the effects of medication and a linear increase in activation was found in the left postcentral gyrus ( a,  ), but not the fusiform gyrus, in AN-NM (n\u00a0=\u00a014) compared to AN-M (n\u00a0=\u00a014).   \nDifferences in BOLD response on the I-FEPT for a linear trend analysis where happy\u00a0>\u00a0mildly happy\u00a0>\u00a0neutral for a) AN-NM (red) compared to AN-M (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005, FDR Corrected), b) for AN-M compared to matched HC (blue) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006, FDR Corrected), and c) for AN-NM (red) compared to matched HC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006, FDR Corrected). \n  \n\nTo further assess the effect of medication, a trend analysis was performed both between AN-M (n\u00a0=\u00a014) and HC (n\u00a0=\u00a014) as well as between AN-NM (n\u00a0=\u00a017) and HC (n\u00a0=\u00a017) using a subset of HC optimally matched based on age and IQ (Supplementary Table 2). The initial comparison showed a linear increase in activation in the left postcentral gyrus in HC compared to AN-M ( b,  ). The second comparison showed a linear increase in the right fusiform gyrus in AN-NM compared to HC ( c,  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe aim of this study was to assess implicit emotion processing in AN using facial expressions along the neutral\u2013happy continuum. Previous studies have reported impairments in emotion processing in AN using questionnaires and discrimination paradigms measuring accuracy and reaction time ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ;), but this is the first study using functional neuroimaging to measure implicit emotion processing in current patients with AN. \n\nOur findings consistently revealed greater activation in AN vs. HC in the fusiform gyrus across all three conditions, which increased along the neutral\u2013happy continuum. This would suggest that alterations in implicit emotion processing occur during early perceptual processing of social signals within the   detection node   of the SIPN ( ) before any social evaluative processes occur in the   affective   and   cognitive-regulatory node  . If we assume that the strength of the BOLD response in this region is an indicator of the salience of the stimulus then this would suggest that individuals with AN are more attentive to facial expressions than HC. Greater activation in the fusiform gyrus in AN has been reported in body image studies as a sign of greater saliency ( ,  ) and taken together this could suggest that, compared to HC, individuals with AN are more engaged in the task. A study by   found an increased startle response in AN to body and food stimuli, but also to pictures depicting positive stimuli. Similarly,   reported slower responses to an Emotional Stroop Task in AN, that was not found when using non-social stimuli. However, the aforementioned study focused on angry facial expressions and did not use any positive stimuli. \n\nIt should be noted that greater activation of the fusiform gyrus has been associated with time spent fixating on facial expressions in ASD ( ). Additionally, a study by  , using eye-tracking, reported that the AN group avoid viewing faces and the eyes, similar to what ASD patients do. However, as there was no indication of a linear increase in time spent fixating on the facial expressions of increasing emotion intensity before giving a response it is unlikely that this was driving the increase in BOLD signal. \n\nThough   suggested that, when using a facial expression recognition task, psychotropic medication might play a role in reaction time, there was no significant difference in reaction time in the AN group between individuals currently taking psychotropic medication and individuals without medication. However, there was a significant difference in accuracy as AN-NM showed higher accuracy. While there was no difference found within AN (AN-NM vs. AN-M) in the right fusiform gyrus, upon contrasting AN-M with HC there was no indication of a greater BOLD response in AN. As AN-NM does show this increase it is likely that AN-NM was the cause of the greater BOLD response in AN. This might suggests that psychotropic medication \u2018normalises\u2019 the BOLD response in AN-M. \n\nStructural brain alterations have frequently been reported in AN, including the regions found in this study ( ), and changes in neurovascular coupling could bias the interpretation of signal changes ( ). While there are no studies on the effect of brain atrophy on the BOLD response in AN, studies in other clinical populations have reported a positive correlation between atrophy and BOLD activation that differs from normal degeneration ( ,  ). Therefore it is uncertain whether these changes actually imply an increase in neural activation, and thus either a prolonged gaze fixation or greater saliency, or if it is an overestimation of the BOLD response due to atrophy. Both groups perform similarly in terms of gender judgement and it is possible that AN may require more resources (cerebral blood flow) in order to perform near the level of HC. Additionally,   found reduced functional connectivity in the fusiform gyrus within the ventral visual network in AN, and this too could play a role in explaining the functional alterations seen here. \n\nPCA revealed that the questionnaires used in this study measure a general level of clinical symptoms present in AN, and that they cannot be used separately to try and control for comorbid disorders. Previous studies have used self-report measures as predictors of performance on emotion processing paradigms in AN ( ,  ,  ,  ), but all with different outcomes. While it is possible that the strong correlations between these measures are solely present in the current study, it is important that future studies carefully consider their use as a predictive measure for performance. \n\nTo date, this is the first study to assess emotion processing in currently ill AN. The results presented here contribute to a neglected area of research into positive emotions in eating disorders and illustrate a difference in neural processing that occurs during the earlier stages of social perception and increases with the emotional intensity. This is distinct from the ASD neuroimaging literature, where a hypoactive fusiform gyrus in response to facial expressions is commonly reported ( ,  ,  ). Likewise, previous neuroimaging studies in depression have found a negative correlation between symptom severity and the magnitude of activation in the fusiform gyrus to positive emotions ( ,  ,  ). Associations between neural activation during emotion processing and trait-anxiety have been found in the insula and amygdala, but not in the fusiform gyrus ( ,  ).   did report significantly greater activation in face-processing regions, including the fusiform gyrus, in OCD patients that increased with symptom severity, but this finding has not been replicated using an implicit emotion processing task. \n\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrated increased BOLD fMRI response in the fusiform gyrus to facial expressions with increasing positive emotional intensity (happiness). This suggests that, in AN, emotionally happy facial expressions are more salient than in HC and this difference remains consistent for facial expressions along the neutral\u2013happy continuum. Additionally, it seems that psychotropic medication does play a role in implicit emotion processing in AN patients. Those taking medication did not show the same changes in the fusiform gyrus compared to HC and demonstrated poorer accuracy on the task. It is important to note, that the BMI of the AN sample is quite \u2018high\u2019 compared to the AN population and this might explain why medication does seem to have some effects in this sample. Our stringent statistical approach employed alongside the largest AN cohort to date makes a strong argument for the findings presented here, but future studies should aim to replicate these findings and assess the role of brain atrophy on the BOLD response in AN. Additionally, future studies of those at risk of developing AN are required to detect possible alterations in the   affective   and the   cognitive-regulatory node   of the SIPN ( ) during development. Further empirical studies exploring emotion processing as well as expression are also required in our endeavour to translate such research findings to clinical practice. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nAs the findings presented here are limited to positive emotions (happiness), it is unknown whether other emotions, such as anger, fear or sadness, elicit a similar response in AN, or if the findings presented here are specific for positive emotions. It is interesting to note that when   investigated both happy and sad facial expressions in recovered AN, they found no functional differences compared to HC, suggesting that similarly to AN brain atrophy, these alterations could be reversible. \n\nWhile post-hoc analysis did not reveal bilateral activation during prototypical happy facial expressions, we hypothesise that changes are present but do not reach significance within our data. This could be due to different temporal patterns of activation in the left and right fusiform gyrus ( ) to facial stimuli that are not optimally captured by event-related modelling of the neural response. \n\nFurthermore, the demonstrated multicollinearity of the questionnaires used here illustrates the caveats to using multiple self-report measures to control for confounding factors in psychiatric disorders with a broad spectrum of comorbidities. Future studies should aim to enforce more rigorous recruitment to aim for more homogenous samples. Additionally, the current sample consisted mostly of the AN-R subtype and it is possible that these results are limited to AN-R. Further research on the differences between AN-R and AN-BP is required either by restricting recruitment to one subtype or by matching AN-R and AN-BP for additional analyses. It is also possible that conducting fMRI at higher field strengths would increase the likelihood of finding subtle differences in regions known to be elusive at lower field strength, such as the amygdala ( ). \n\nFinally, as the presence of medication seems to \u2018normalise\u2019 the BOLD response in AN it is therefore vital that future studies not only take these effects into account, but also perhaps delve deeper into the efficacy of psychotropic medication on emotion processing. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis work was supported by the   and  , by the   and  . \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID:

Previous studies have addressed the neural correlates of self-referential processes in response to or related to external stimuli. We here investigated brain activity associated with a short, exclusively mental process of self-reflection in the absence of external stimuli or behavioural requirements. Healthy subjects reflected either on themselves, a personally known or an unknown person during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The reflection period was initialized by a cue and followed by photographs of the respective persons (perception of pictures of oneself or the other person). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nSelf-reflection, compared with reflecting on the other persons and to a major part also compared with perceiving photographs of one-self, was associated with more prominent dorsomedial and lateral prefrontal, insular, anterior and posterior cingulate activations. Whereas some of these areas showed activity in the \u201cother\u201d-conditions as well, self-selective characteristics were revealed in right dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex for self-reflection; in anterior cingulate cortex for self-perception and in the left inferior parietal lobe for self-reflection and -perception. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nAltogether, cingulate, medial and lateral prefrontal, insular and inferior parietal regions show relevance for self-related cognitions, with in part self-specificity in terms of comparison with the known-, unknown- and perception-conditions. Notably, the results are obtained here without behavioural response supporting the reliability of this methodological approach of applying a solely mental intervention. We suggest considering the reported structures when investigating psychopathologically affected self-related processing. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nHumans not only have a neural representation of the external and social world, they also have the ability to represent themselves as coherent human beings and as a self. They can reflect on themselves as a person and they have a neural representation of their own body. Understanding the basis of neural self-representation is not only interesting from a philosophical or scientific point of view but may also have practical implications in psychiatry, for example, in understanding disturbed self-related functions occurring during depression [ ]. \n\nIn the last decade, a growing number of studies has assessed the neural bases of self-related processes using functional neuroimaging methods [ - ] and electrical tomographic techniques [ ]. In these studies, brain activity was examined, for example, while viewing photographs of oneself compared to that obtained while viewing photographs of other persons, or while recognizing one\u2019s own face, names, voices or morphed photographs [ , , - ]. Other approaches have addressed the relevance of trait adjectives with reference to oneself and compared brain activity to that occurring under control conditions, for example reference of trait adjectives to close friends or others, or have applied more complex self-referential tasks which required responses to external stimuli [ , , , - ]. Self-referential memory [ - ], emotional domains [ , ] and cognitive aspects in the spatial domain such as navigational tasks or perspective-taking tasks [ , ] have also been examined. Self-reference has been further studied in relation to the external world or from the perspective of the self as an object, i.e. from the perspective of a third-person [ , , ] or relative to certain features of the self, for example individual goals [ ], psychological aspects [ ] and social issues [ ]. \n\nRecent meta-analyses of functional neuroimaging studies have confirmed the involvement of certain brain regions in self-referential processes [ , , ]: medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), anterior and posterior cingulate cortices (ACC, PCC) and (pre)cuneus, which also reflect the concept of cortical midline areas and self-reference [ ]. Further, the lateral and ventromedial prefrontal, medial temporal, and parieto-temporal regions, the insular cortex and other regions were found to be active during self-referential processes [ , , , , ]. \n\nFrom a methodological perspective, all these studies have in common that they examine the neural bases of self-reference in response to external stimuli or in comparison to behavioural tasks potentially involving other cognitive domains. This could make it difficult to assess self-referential activity possible interferences from neural activity related to external cognitions or actions. Certainly, these studies acknowledged the methodological issue of implementing behavioural controls. However, it may be of value to assess whether or not the brain areas reported are also active during a restrictively mental and not behavioural self-referential condition, and whether these areas show more or less specific activity for self-reference than other areas in terms of activation during self-reflection but not during reflection about others or during self-photo perception. In this study, we investigated the neural processes underlying self-reference in the sense of self-reflection, however, compared to other studies without possibly interfering for instance visual or verbal stimuli. The term \u201cself-reflection\u201d comprises at very least processes such as becoming aware of and reflecting on one\u2019s current and past experiences and one\u2019s self-concept, including the self-relevance of trait words [ ]. The division between self-reflection, and self-recognition or self-awareness and even self-consciousness is not clear-cut [ , , ]. Some authors have defined self-reflection as cognitively reflecting on one\u2019s sense of self, i.e. on a collection of schema regarding one\u2019s abilities and traits [ ]. Accordingly, we here aimed to direct the subjects to reflect on themselves as a person and on their identity. This was realized by issuing a concrete instruction to the subject for self-reflection (e.g. \u201cwho am I?\u201d), whereby the subjects could select their own content. As control condition, we instructed subjects to reflect on a personal acquaintance of the same gender. This was to control for the process of reflecting on a personally known person and the related knowledge and memory. Subjects were further requested to reflect on an unknown person who was introduced to them by photograph prior to the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session. This controlled for general reflection on a person. In order to intensify reflection, we also presented photographs of the respective persons after the reflection period. Considering the unconventional methodological approach with respect to non-implementation of a behavioural control, we applied very conservative statistics. \n\nOur hypothesis was that the solely mental task of self-reflection would still be associated with brain activity particularly in cortical midline regions such as the medial prefrontal (MPFC) and cingulate cortices, but also in ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal and insular regions and in lateral parietal cortex areas [ , , , ]. We predicted different activities for mental self-reflection than for perception of self-related stimuli, thus insinuating self-reflection specific activation. In addition, we were interested in whether or not certain brain regions are specifically associated with self-reflection (refl-self) and self-perception (perc-self) when compared to those areas associated with reflections on other persons (refl-known, refl-unknown) or the perception of photographs of other persons (perc-known, perc-unknown). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe primary contrast in the reflection period (1), a conjunction of (refl-self\u2009>\u2009refl-known) & (refl-self\u2009>\u2009refl-unknown), revealed those regions of the brain with greater activity under the self-condition compared to these for known-reflection and unknown-reflection, which were among others the bilateral insular and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (Ins/VLPFC) areas, the ACC, the PCC and the dorsal MPFC (DMPFC; Table\u2009 ). The left Ins/VLPFC region, right DLPFC, DMPFC, and PCC showed also more prominent activity in the second conjoined contrast (2), adding (refl-self\u2009>\u2009perc-self) to contrast (1), under the conditions of self-reflection compared to self-perception (Table\u2009 , Figure\u2009 ). \n  \nAnalysis of the reflection period \n  \nActivity during self-reflection significantly larger (random effects analysis, p\u2009>\u20090.005, p\u2009<\u20090.01 Monte Carlo simulation corrected) than in the known and the unknown reflection conditions. \n\nActivation as in a) but also larger in the refl-self than in the perc-self condition. \n\nAbbreviations: R right, L left.

The colour-coded maps indicate those areas of the brain with greater t activity during self-reflection than under all other conditions (p\u2009<\u20090.005, Monte Carlo simulation with cluster wise correction p\u2009<\u20090.01).

All regions have greater activity during the reflection periods than during perception of the photograph. All other significant clusters were also activated under the \u2018other\u2019-reflection-conditions. \n  \nAssessing the contribution of the single conditions within the resulting clusters, the activity during refl-self was, as expected, most pronounced, although activity was also present during the other conditions of reflection. In contrast, the activity associated with perc-self was not significant compared to the baseline (Figure\u2009 A, B). The DMPFC was significantly active relative to the baseline (t\u2009=\u20099.6) during refl-self, whereas there was no activity during perc-self (t\u2009=\u20090.6; Figure\u2009 A). However, the DMPFC was also active under the conditions of both refl-known (t\u2009=\u20095.9) and refl-unknown (t\u2009=\u20094.5) when compared to the baseline although these activities were significantly less than those for refl-self (refl-self\u2009>\u2009refl-known: t\u2009=\u20094.4; refl-self\u2009>\u2009refl-unknown: t\u2009=\u20095.5). Comparable results were obtained for the left insular cortex and adjacent inferior frontal gyrus (Figure\u2009 B). The right middle frontal gyrus corresponding to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was active only in the self-reflection condition (t\u2009=\u20096.2), which was significantly different to the other-conditions where the DLPFC showed no activity or deactivation. The PCC showed equivalent characteristics (refl-self t\u2009=\u20094.8) with no activation or even deactivation in the other conditions. \n  \n Beta-weights (beta, y-axis) of the single contrasts.

Additional activity was detected in the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL)/somatosensory cortex (SSC), intraparietal sulcus and bilaterally in the surrounding area of the temporo-occipital junction (Table\u2009 , Figure\u2009 ). The ACC activity was self-selective under the conditions of perc-self (t\u2009=\u20092.8; perc-uk t\u2009=\u2009- 4.0, perc-kn t\u2009=\u2009- 1.4; perc-self\u2009>\u2009perc-uk t\u2009=\u20095.7, perc-self\u2009>\u2009perc-kn t\u2009=\u20095.2) and in part under the conditions of self-reflection (Figure\u2009 A, Figure\u2009 C; refl-self t\u2009=\u20096.4, refl-kn t\u2009=\u20094.3, refl-uk t\u2009=\u20090.7; refl-self\u2009>\u2009refl-uk t\u2009=\u20096.1, refl-self\u2009>\u2009refl-kn t\u2009=\u20093.5,). \n  \nAnalysis of the picture perception period \n  \nGiven are brain regions resulting from the contrast (perc-self\u2009>\u2009perc-known) & (perc-self\u2009>\u2009perc-unknown) with activity significantly larger during self-perception and lower than in the known and the unknown condition (random effects analysis, p\u2009>\u20090.005, p\u2009<\u20090.01 Monte Carlo simulation corrected).

(  A  ) ACC and (  B  ) IPL/SSC R, which were also active during self-reflection. (  C  ) The occipital visual cortex region was less active during self-perception than under the other conditions. \n  \nThe right IPL/SSC was the only region with significant individual activity attributed to each of the refl-self (t\u2009=\u20092.3) and perc-self (t\u2009=\u20093.2) condition separately and with no significant activity under the conditions of known and unknown (Figure\u2009 B, Figure\u2009 D), and further with differences between the self- and other conditions (refl-self\u2009>\u2009refl-uk t\u2009=\u20093.3, perc-self\u2009>\u2009perc-uk t\u2009=\u20094.5, refl-self\u2009>\u2009refl-kn t\u2009=\u20091.6, perc-self\u2009>\u2009perc-kn t\u2009=\u20095.0). In occipital regions, particularly in the cuneus, perc-self was associated with less activity than under the other conditions of perception (Table\u2009 , Figure\u2009 C). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Brain activity associated with self-reflection \n  \nThe objective of the present study was the identification of brain regions involved in mental self-referential processing during self-reflection upon exclusion of interfering external stimuli, tasks or specific self-referential events. We determined activities in the insular, anterior and posterior cingulate, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and DMPFC to be involved in the process of self-reference. This emphasizes the role of cortical midline areas [ , ] but also of lateral prefrontal and parietal areas, in self-related processing as self-reflection and converges with the findings of recent meta-analyses on neural correlates in the field of self-referential processes [ , , , ], albeit not a complete overlap of all brain regions. The temporoparietal junction (TPJ) was in our study only activated in the picture presentation condition and not in the self-reflection period. This makes sense when considering the proposed role of the TPJ in distinguishing self and other [ ] which may be relevant in the perception condition but less during self-reflection. Interestingly, except for in the anterior cingulate cortex region, brain activity was more pronounced when reflecting on oneself than when viewing photographs of oneself. Right DLPFC and PCC even showed self-reflection specific characteristics with stronger activity than the other conditions which showed no activation. The PCC is known to be involved in self-referential processing [ , ], internally directed thoughts [ ] and autobiographic memory [ ] which were all involved in self-reflection in the current study. In parallel to meta-analytic results on the overlap between self-referential processes and brain regions known to be involved in the default mode network (DMN, [ ]) we found prominent activation in the ACC and PCC in the self-reflection condition. This result supports the functional overlap between active and consciously induced self-reflection and self-related mental processes during resting states [ ]. Within the frame of our applied conjunctions and the selected statistical threshold, we revealed no relatively stronger activity during self-reflection in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), which has been shown in a comparable PET study on self-reflection [ ]. Meta-analyses found consistent results when including studies using PET and fMRI [ , , ]. However, the long duration of the conditions (100\u2009sec) in the PET study by d\u2019Argembeau et al. could account for this difference in the VMPFC in the two studies. Further, the applied conjunctions lead to restricted results, whereby the single contrast of for instance \u2018self\u2019 versus \u2018unknown\u2019 reflection was accompanied by VPMPC activity, which however is not reported in detail here due to focusing on the primary question. Another PET study [ ], comparing reflections on personality traits and the physical appearance of oneself compared to reflections on a specific famous person resulted in brain activity in dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortical regions, which is comparable to our results. A recent study attempted to disentangle differential functions of dorso- and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and detected primarily deactivations in the VMPFC correlating with the degree of self-descriptiveness and increasing activations in DMPFC regions with increasing self-relevance of the given stimuli [ ]. It is also possible, that the lack of VMPFC-activation in our study is related to the specific task with no specific given stimuli which had to be judged regarding self-relatedness. Our results and existing literature present evidence for the involvement of insular, cingulate, ventrolateral and dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortical regions in self-related processing and, as shown in this study, specifically in self-reflection. \n\n\n### Activations in the known and unknown conditions \n  \nAdding to the view that self-related processing activates, in particular, midline prefrontal areas of the brain, our data also revealed activity in these regions during reflection on \u2018known\u2019 and \u2018unknown\u2019 persons, even although the associated activity was lower than that associated with reflection on oneself. This was indicated by analyzing the various conditions of reflection relative to a baseline and by analyzing local signal changes obtained by fMRI. Our results are in line with previous studies addressing appraisal of oneself and appraisal under the conditions of known and unknown persons [ - ]. The condition \u2018unknown\u2019 was also associated with activity in the MPFC and insular regions. The activity under the conditions \u2018known\u2019 and \u2018unknown\u2019 may well be explained by considering theory of mind [ , - ]. When reflecting on others, humans engage their mind and activate self-related brain regions for mentalizing others and mental state inference [ , ]. A related explanation is that these brain regions are involved in social cognition with self-related aspects as mirror neuron functions and a co-representation of the self and others which have been reported to involve respective prefrontal midline regions [ - ]. One could argue that the subjects in our study might have dealt with themselves under the \u2018other\u2019-conditions. However, our standardized instructions were easily understood by the subjects and they were asked to verbally confirm that they had performed the task precisely as instructed. Further, limitations in the performance of the task would not explain the selective activation in the anterior cingulate and somatosensory cortices under conditions of \u2018self\u2019-reflection, which strongly indicate a distinct task performance. Studies using longer phases of reflection involved intensive interviews on the content, self-relatedness and vividness of imaginations, which is necessary to control for interfering thoughts not related to the primary task. However, the conditions we used were, being of less than 10\u2009s duration, relatively short, such that we could initiate the process of self-reflection by letting the subjects reflect on themselves under the question \u201cwho am I?\u201d This should have reduced fluctuations in cognition as well as possible mind-wandering. \n\nThe primary visual cortex was less active when viewing photographs of oneself than when viewing photographs of other persons. This might be explained by the novelty and unfamiliarity of the unknown person demanding more attention and more cognition and, hence, a correspondingly greater activity in the primary visual cortex [ ]. \n\n\n### Self-selective activations \n  \nThe only regions of the brain that appeared to be of certain selectivity for self-related processing, in the sense of not or hardly exerting activity under the \u2018known\u2019 and \u2018unknown\u2019 conditions and with significantly stronger activity associated with the self- compared to the \u2018known\u2018and \u2018unknown\u2019 conditions, were the ACC and somatosensory-associated parietal areas for the perception period. The term \u201cself-specific\u201d has to be used with caution [ ]: in agreement with Gillihan and Farah, we did not claim to find structures solely involved in self-referential processes but rather to analyse associations between brain regions and self-reference which is also reflected in the overlap of self and familiar other related brain regions in two meta-analyses [ , ]. With regard to the objections of Gillihan and Farah [ ], our study tried to circumvent some of the constraints of previous studies such as possible interferences of verbal or visual stimulus material used for referential processes with the aspect of self-reference itself. Our study adds to the existing literature by using a more naturalistic approach similar to everyday self-referential thinking without direction onto specific stimuli and contents. \n\nThe ACC was further more strongly stronger activated during self-reflection compared to \u2018known\u2019 and unknown\u2019 reflection, whenever the \u2018known\u2019 reflection exerted slight activity. The ACC is known to be associated with conflict monitoring and to detect discrepancies between the actual and the desired state [ , ]. Functionally, cingulate regions are known to mediate integration and evaluation of emotional, motivational and cognitive information, and to modulate attention [ , ] with direct connections to the amygdala, thalamus, prefrontal and insular areas and to the parietal lobe [ ]. Thus, within a regulatory network, the ACC may have the function of assessing whether signals or stimuli have a relation to or relevance for the person as was proposed by van der Meer et al. [ ]. However, following the logic of the ACC functioning as a discrepancy detector, why should it be active when one reflects on oneself? In this study, we instructed the subjects to reflect about whom they were and how they were. This may have initiated autobiographical considerations on the current state and the intended goals in life. The task may thus have induced critical self-reflection and have made the subject aware of discrepancies between his/her actual state and desired state. This self-reflection would, of course, be reduced, or perhaps not occur at all, when reflecting on other persons. A recent study [ ] investigated brain activity in subjects viewing photographs of their own face or body in comparison to the activity when viewing photographs either of a close colleague or of scrambled images. This also was associated with activation of the ACC, the right anterior insula and the adjacent inferior frontal gyrus. The authors proposed that the insula and the ACC could provide an abstract representation of the self that might participate in maintaining the sense of self. Similarly, another study addressing the relation of trait adjectives to the own person and an acquaintance identified insular and anterior cingulate cortex activation to differentiate between self and other reference with a self-specificity for insular activity [ ]. \n\nAn electroencephalography study [ ] reported reflective self-reference in contrast to other-reference to activate more DMPFC regions and the right anterior insula. Pre-reflective self-reference was accompanied by left insular and dorsal and ventral prefrontal activities. This is consistent with our findings assuming that we did not differentiate between pre-reflective aspects and reflective self-reference. Pre-reflective self, or \u2018minimal\u2019 self, was defined as \u2018consciousness of oneself as an immediate subject of experience, not extended in time\u2019 [ ]. A contribution of the \u2018minimal\u2019 self as a basic function may generally be present in self-referential processing and, particularly, during self-reflection. The task we used in this study was supposed to involve both reflective and pre-reflective processes, which is reflected by our findings on brain activation. \n\nThe other brain region specifically activated under the conditions of \u2018self\u2019 was the IPL comprising the region \u2018PF\u2019 [ ], the ventral intraparietal cortex corresponding to the IPL and parts of the postcentral bank hosting the SSC. These regions are strongly associated with somatosensory processing, especially the anterior bank of the parietal lobule, and also integrate visual and auditory information [ - ]. They may thus form a higher-order perceptional representation of the self as a result of integration of multimodal sensory information. In this study, these areas were active in the mental condition, supporting a concept that they may also provide for a self-representation when mentally directing attention to oneself or when a self-image is required for reflection purposes or for self-identification. \n\nWe confirm earlier findings that the mentioned areas of the brain are associated with self-reflection, whereby our strict and conservative approach has to be considered with regard to areas not reported, such as the anterior medial prefrontal cortex regions, the temporal cortex and the subcortical regions as upper brainstem [ , , ]. \n\nResults on self-reflection processes may have implications for psychiatric disorders which have self-related psychopathologies [ , - ]. There is evidence that, for example, depression and social anxiety disorder are both associated with a heightened cognitive, mostly ruminative self-focus, pointing to dysfunctional activation of brain areas involved in self-related processing [ , , ]. A prominent part of self-related processing in affective disorders such as depression occurs without external stimuli, which is comparable to the conditions used in the present study. A task for the future will be to assess the involved regions of the brain for possible alterations in self-processing, such as, for example, dysfunctional attractors in depression. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur findings underline the concept of a primary involvement of medial and also lateral prefrontal, parietal and insular regions in self-related processing, demonstrated here with an experimental task abstaining from externally oriented behavioural requirements. These areas, as the DMPFC, were also active while reflecting on others, thus putting a certain self-selectivity into perspective. Specificity for self-related activation was shown only in the ACC and in regions of the inferior parietal cortex associated with somatosensation. From a methodological viewpoint, we emphasize here the expected and plausible association of these areas with a mental self-related condition in the absence of external stimuli and without required behavioural responses. This underlines the possibility of using such an approach for investigating self-related neural processing. The reported areas may be considered when investigating disturbed self-related processing in psychiatric disorders. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-five healthy subjects (aged 23-41\u2009years, 17 females, all right-handed according to a handedness questionnaire [ ]) were contacted by direct address or mailing lists. Subjects were screened for exclusion criteria such as prior and current neurological or psychiatric illnesses, the use of medication or other psychotropic substances (excluding contraceptives), pregnancy, excessive consummation of alcohol, cigarettes and caffeine, and the general contraindications for fMRI. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the canton of Z\u00fcrich (project nr. E 62/2007) and conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects provided their written informed consent. After scanning, subjects completed a post-experimental non-structured interview on their performance of the task. Two subjects reported sleepiness and lack of concentration during fMRI and one subject showed several movement artefacts (sudden head movements of more than 3\u2009mm). The data for these three subjects were, therefore, excluded from the analysis. The other subjects confirmed that they had been able to follow the instructions. \n\nPrior to scanning photographs of each subject (\u2018self\u2019) or for each subject of a person known to him/her (\u2018known\u2019; work or study colleague but not a close friend or a relative since intense emotional relationships would interfere with the results), or of a person of the same sex and not known by the subjects (\u2018unknown\u2019) were obtained. The photographs were taken within the grounds of the Psychiatric University Hospital, Zurich. Situations, positions (portrait in relation to whole body), background and perspectives were standardized in a script (for examples of the photographs, see Figure\u2009 ). Subjects were instructed to display relaxed and neutral facial expressions and body positions, in particular not to express any explicit emotions, although a normal friendly \u2018photo-smile\u2019 was permitted. Clothing was neutral and casual. Photographs presented to each subject of always the same known person and always the same unknown person and were matched for gender and approximate age. The subjects were shown photographs of the known person and the unknown person prior to scanning. \n  \n Schematic summary of the paradigm.   The paradigm comprises a cued reflection period followed by perception of a photograph to the cued person for the indicated periods of time. For each condition, the same standardized set of photographs was shown in a random order. The subjects were instructed to reflect on the cued person in the \u2018reflection\u2019 period and to view the photograph during the \u2018perception\u2019 period (photos reprinted here with explicit consent of the shown subjects). \n  \n\n### Experimental design \n  \nThe experimental task comprised a cue indicating the trial conditions, a period for mental reflection without external stimuli, then a period for perception of the relevant photograph (Figure\u2009 ). To investigate only the process of self-referential reflection, the subjects were instructed to generate self-reflective cognitions in the absence of external stimulation other than the short abstract cue (1\u2009s) indicating the beginning of the trial and the person concerned. The periods for reflection lasted less than 10\u2009s, thus primarily representing the induction and early phase of mental reflective processes. Photographs of themselves were introduced to each subject in order to compare brain activities under conditions of reflexion and perception. Self-reflection and perception were also controlled under conditions of reflection on and perception of either a known or an unknown person. The \u2018known\u2019 condition consisted of a period to reflect on a person who had a distant relationship to the subject\u2019s self, such as a colleague or an acquaintance. The \u2018unknown\u2019 condition, serving as a control, consisted of a period for reflection on an unknown person, followed by the viewing of a photograph of this unknown person. \n\nEach trial period was initiated by a cue as instruction and terminated by the disappearance of the photographs (Figure\u2009 ). The subjects were instructed and trained before scanning as follows: \u201cThe cue indicates a person who will later appear in a photograph. In the period that follows, reflect about that person, who and how she/he is or might be, for instance \u2018who am I, how am I as a person\u2019 or \u2018who and how is she/he\u2019. When the photograph is presented, just look at the photo\u201d. The instructing cues for self: \u25cb, known: or unknown: \u25ca, were presented for 1\u2009s. They were graphically abstract and without any intrinsic meaning. Including the cue, the reflection conditions lasted 9900\u2009ms, equivalent to 5 TRs (repetition time for the fMRI volumes). The photographs were presented for 5940\u2009ms, equivalent to 3 TRs. Then, a baseline period of 8 TRs followed until the next trial was started. In total, each subject performed each condition 12 times in a randomized order. The task was programmed with PresentationTM, Neurobehavioral Systems, USA. After scanning, subjects were interviewed on their ability to perform the task; all included subjects were completely able and fulfilled this criterion. The main information reported for self-reference were individual facts (such as name, age, employment and family status) as well as autobiographical and future-oriented pieces of information (such as \u201cI was born in \u2026\u201d, \u201cI want to be \u2026\u201d, \u201cI am \u2026\u201d). The subjects were not questioned on the personal content of their reflection in order to avoid self-confrontation or the disclosure of private thoughts. \n\nWhen designing the experimental task, we purposely did not use external stimuli or an external relation as implemented motor responses, nor did we use cognitive or behavioural task for instance requiring decision making. This was to avoid any interference with the self-reflection process, and, hence, to enable us to focus on the mental component of the reflection task. Such, the solely mental self-reference is meant in the sense of an absence of possibly interrupting external stimuli. One might argue that a behavioural response for task performance or a control for attentiveness during the task is lacking, but such an additional task would have directed the attention of the subjects to the performance of this controlling task and away from the performance of the primary task. In order to control for subject attentiveness and cooperation, the direct task-related activity in each subject\u2019s primary visual cortex was controlled to assure that at least visual perception was functional since, for example, closing of the eyes would have resulted in missing or low activity in the visual cortex at least during the perception of the pictures. \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nImaging was performed using a 3.0\u2009T GE SignaTM HD Scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, USA, 8-channel head coil). Echo-planar imaging (EPI) was performed for fMRI (TR/TE 1980/32\u2009ms, 22 sequential axial slices, whole brain, 3.5\u2009mm slice thickness, 1\u2009mm gap, resulting voxel size 3.125\u2009\u00d7\u20093.125\u2009\u00d7\u20094.5\u2009mm, matrix 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964 voxel, 200\u2009mm field of view, 70\u00b0 flip angle). 468 volumes were obtained per subject, 16 volumes per trial. The first 4 volumes were discarded to allow for T2 equilibration effects. High-resolution 3-D T1-weighted anatomical volumes were acquired (TR/TE 9.9/2.9\u2009ms; matrix size 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009mm; 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm resolution, axial orientation) for co-registration with the functional data. T2-weighted images in parallel to the EPI sequence were acquired to exclude possible T2-sensitive abnormalities. The stimuli were presented via digital video goggles (Resonance Technologies, Northridge, CA). \n\n\n### Data analysis and statistics \n  \nFMRI data were analyzed using BrainVoyagerTM QX 1.10.1 (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands [ ]). Pre-processing of the functional scans included motion correction, slice scan time correction, temporal high-pass filtering and removal of linear trends. Functional images were superimposed on the anatomical images and incorporated into 3-D data sets. The individual 3-D data sets were transformed into Talairach space [ ], with a resulting voxel size of 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm, then spatially smoothed with an 8-mm Gaussian kernel for subsequent group analysis. Six predictors, representing the three conditions each of reflection (refl) and perception (perc, refl-self, perc-self, refl-known, perc-known, refl-unknown, perc-unknown) were used to build the design matrix. Single trials with fMRI signal artefacts of more than threefold mean signal change amplitude (e.g. due to head movements) were eliminated. The trial periods were modelled as epochs using a two-gamma hemodynamic response function adapted to the applied period duration provided by BrainVoyager. \n\nThe fMRI data analysis, based on the general linear model, comprised the following steps: First, fixed effects analyses were calculated separately for each subject under the conditions of reflection and perception for \u2018self\u2019, \u2018known\u2019, \u2018unknown\u2019, each resulting in summary images. The summary images were subjected to second-level random effects group analyses, also using conjunctions (&). Three-dimensional statistical parametric maps were calculated for the group analysis with separate subject predictor using random effects analyses, whereby we controlled for and avoided the minimum-t problem [ ] by building masks of the single contrasts and verifying that the resulting clusters from the conjunctions are within these clusters and such represent a logical AND-condition. The statistical threshold for reporting results was set to p\u2009<\u20090.005 and to a cluster-wise level of p\u2009<\u20090.01 (considering the Talairach voxels of 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093) mm after correction for multiple comparisons by application of the respective cluster thresholds according to a Monte Carlo simulation [ ]. \n\nWe were interested in brain activity during self-reflection and in this context for \u201cself-specific\u201d activation meaning here significantly more activation in the self-conditions than in the other conditions with these not showing activation. Therefore, the main contrasts were: \n\nSelf-specific conjoined comparison in the reflection period: \n\n(refl-self\u2009>\u2009refl-known) & (refl-self\u2009>\u2009refl-unknown) \n\nas primary outcome measure. \n\nTo identify areas with greater activity during self-reflection than during self-perception, the additional conjunction with the contrast (refl-self\u2009>\u2009perc-self) resulting in the contrast: \n\n(refl-self\u2009>\u2009refl-known) & (refl-self\u2009>\u2009refl-unknown) & (refl-self\u2009>\u2009perc-self) \n\nas secondary outcome measure. \n\nTo differentiate the contributions of each separate condition to the clusters resulting from the conjunction analyses (and corresponding to the main effect), we conducted a post-hoc analysis in which an additional random-effects analysis within the resulting clusters was performed to determine the effects of each single condition on brain activity. Self-selectivity in our context was defined as significant activity in a region during reflection or perception only under the \u2018self\u2019-condition and not under the conditions \u2018known\u2019 or \u2018unknown\u2019. \n\nFor reasons of comparison with previous studies addressing self-selectivity during the perception of pictures of the own and other persons, the conjunction (perc-self\u2009>\u2009perc-known) & (perc-self\u2009>\u2009perc-unknown) was analyzed. In the resulting clusters with self-selective activation characteristics, the effects of the individual conditions were investigated in a post-hoc random-effects analysis as described above. \n\n\n\n## Competing interests \n  \nAll authors declare that there are no competing interests. \n\n\n## Authors\u2019 contributions \n  \nThe study was conceived and designed by UH, LJ and AB.

Specifically, activation differences in   ventral precuneus   (as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) has been linked to an exemplar-based judgment process, where judgments are based on memory for previous similar cases. Ventral precuneus is implicated in various episodic memory processes, notably such that   increased   activity during learning in this region as well as in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the medial temporal lobes (MTL) have been linked to retrieval success. The present study used fMRI during a multiple-cue judgment task to gain novel neurocognitive evidence informative for the link between learning-related activity changes in ventral precuneus and exemplar-based judgment. Participants (  N   = 27) spontaneously learned to make judgments during fMRI, in a multiple-cue judgment task specifically designed to induce exemplar-based processing. Contrasting brain activity during late learning to early learning revealed   higher   activity in ventral precuneus, the bilateral MTL, and the vmPFC. Activity in the ventral precuneus and the vmPFC was found to parametrically increase between each judgment event, and activity levels in the ventral precuneus predicted performance after learning. These results are interpreted such that the ventral precuneus supports the aspects of exemplar-based processes that are related to episodic memory, tentatively by building, storing, and being implicated in retrieving memory representations for judgment. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe act of multiple-cue judgment \u2013 to estimate a continuous criterion based on multiple cues \u2013 is something people engage in repeatedly in life. Consider for example how a teacher grades an essay, a car dealer estimates the price of a used car, or judges sentencing a criminal. Behavioral multiple-cue judgment research has traditionally focused on how people rely on rule-based processes, with weighted integration of each cue value, in order to make inferences. Linear regression models tend to describe such behavior well (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). However, recent behavioral research has repeatedly demonstrated that judgments like these are often influenced by similarity-based comparisons to previously experienced similar situations stored in memory, a process that is well described by exemplar-based models (EBMs) (c.f.  ;  ; see e.g.,  ,  ). It has even been suggested that similarity-based strategies are hard to resist when making inferences ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nRecently, this research was extended with brain imaging data demonstrating that the medial parietal cortex, specifically the ventral precuneus, might be key for a similarity-based judgment process ( ). In that study, looking at brain activation in a test phase after learning, the ventral precuneus was activated compared to baseline in four different multiple-cue judgment conditions (  N   = 74), during both rule-based and similarity-based judgment processes. Interestingly, activity in this region predicted how well an EBM, but not a rule-based model, fit judgment data, raising the intriguing possibility that the role for ventral precuneus in human multiple-cue judgment is related to similarity-based processes ( ). \n\nPrecuneus has received relatively little attention in the previous related literature, considering it might actually be a key hub for human judgment. Partly, this can be explained by the fact that several related studies in the field of categorization (i.e., the cognitively less demanding task where the criterion is binary instead of continuous) have focused on the logic of contrasting strategies against each other. Thus, to the extent that similarity-based processes are at play also when other strategies are executed, common activations in this brain region might have been canceled out. Similarity-based processes have instead by the logic of contrasting strategies for example been found to evoke higher activity than rule-based processes in the anterior prefrontal cortex and the inferior parietal cortex, whereas rule-based strategies instead evoke higher activity than similarity-based processes in the anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the posterior parietal cortex (e.g.,  ;  ;  ; for reviews see also  ). Another reason for why precuneus might have been overlooked can be that several categorization studies have focused on   a priori   regions of interest, for example the medial temporal lobes (MTL). For instance, some recent studies have used model-based fMRI with EBMs and have found the MTL to be involved in concept learning ( ), memory strength ( ), and typicality of a memory representation used for exemplar-based similarity comparison ( ). Others have detailed the neurocognitive processes involved in human category learning, without explicit reference to similarity-based processes   per se  , but with converging evidence for the involvement of the basal ganglia ( ;  ;  ; for a review see  ) and cortico-striatal loops (e.g.,  ). Finally, yet another reason precuneus have not been stressed in research on similarity-based judgment processes could be that judgment and categorization require different responses, where activity necessary for judgment might not necessarily be evoked in a categorization task, and vice versa. In one of the very few existing imaging studies of multiple-cue judgment,   demonstrated that making test-phase judgments with an exemplar-based strategy was associated with higher activity in the inferior parietal cortex and the inferior prefrontal cortex compared to a heuristic rule-based process, whereas a rule-based condition engaged the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, precentral gyrus, and temporo-parietal regions more than an exemplar-based strategy. The reason that precuneus was not observed in that study could again be related to the possibility that the subtraction logic canceled out shared activity in precuneus. Notably, the ventral precuneus was recently found to be more engaged in an exemplar-based judgment condition compared to a rule-based judgment condition in a multiple-cue judgment task even though the conditions were directly contrasted ( ) implying that experimental design might also be an important factor. \n\nTo the extent that ventral precuneus should be linked to exemplar-based processes, there are different possibilities pertaining to the role of this region in this type of process. One possibility is that the ventral precuneus is related to the   mnemonic representational   aspects necessary for exemplar-based processes in human multiple-cue judgment. The ventral precuneus has been extensively linked to episodic memory ( ;  ;  ; for a review see  ) and has been found to re-activate for stimuli that are familiar due to recent exposure (the encoding-retrieval flip, for overviews see  ;  ). In addition, increased activity in the ventral precuneus, the MTL and the vmPFC during learning reflect mnemonic processing during encoding, and later retrieval success (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). One hypothesis could thus be that the ventral precuneus in a similar manner could support exemplar-based judgment, with increased activity during learning as a function of more established memory representations used for judgment. \n\nThere are also other alternatives to how the link between the ventral precuneus and exemplar-based processes could be understood. For example, activity changes in precuneus could be related to   visuo-spatial attention   with the demands of attending to stimuli with multiple attributes (see e.g., for a review  ). Damage to this region has been shown to result in difficulties attending to a visual stimulus ( ) and has been reported when maintaining attention in an orientation discrimination task in healthy participants ( ). Moreover, the precuneus, including the ventral areas, routinely exhibits reduced activity over time in perceptually attention demanding cognitive tasks together with the vmPFC (e.g.,  ;  ). Thus, an alternative hypothesis could be that the ventral precuneus exhibit reduced activation during learning related to decreased attentional demands of performing a multiple-cue judgment task. \n\nIn the present study we aimed to use event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during judgment learning to investigate how ventral precuneus plays a role in exemplar-based processes and whether this role should be characterized as reflecting mnemonic representational aspects, or visuo-spatial attention. If an exemplar-based process in the ventral precuneus is key for human judgment, we should see changes in this region during the learning phase. If so, we hypothesized that, if the ventral precuneus is involved in building memory representations for exemplar-based judgment, an   increased   BOLD signal should be observed in a number of   a priori   regions of interest: the ventral precuneus, the MTL and the vmPFC, during the course of learning. Higher activity in the ventral precuneus toward the end of learning was also expected to be directly related to performance on the learning items after learning, connecting activity levels to retrieval success (e.g.,  ;  ; for reviews see  ;  ;  ). On the other hand, if the ventral precuneus is rather involved in directing attention toward the different features of stimuli with multiple attributes, we hypothesized that a   reduction   of activity should be observed in the ventral precuneus during the course of learning (see e.g.,  ;  ) as a function of the task being less and less attentionally demanding. Finally, if brain activity in this region was in addition observed to be significantly higher than baseline across all scanned blocks, and this activity was functionally related to the fit of an EBM after learning, this would provide further support the suggestion that ventral precuneus is a key brain region multiple-cue judgment, and exemplar-based processes specifically ( ). \n\nDuring scanning, participants (young and healthy) spontaneously learned a multiple-cue judgment task based on a biological scenario. A multiplicative relationship between cue and criterion was applied, successfully used to induce exemplar-based processes in past behavioral studies (e.g.,  ;  ) and two imaging studies ( ;  ). It has been demonstrated that when it is difficult to rely on a linear weighted rule, for example when the cue-combination rule is multiplicative, and people spontaneously adhere to an exemplar-based strategy (see e.g.,  ;  ). \n\nThe experimental set up was designed to yield large differences in cognitive model predictions on the final test phase judgments between rule-based and EBMs, in order to confirm that the task manipulation described above had been successful. Some items were introduced during learning (training items) and a set of new items at test, and the behavioral responses were used to verify the models predictions. An EBM predicts that stored learning items will be retrieved from memory to make a judgment of new test items, with better performance for old than for new items and an inability to extrapolate to criterion values outside the acquired learning range ( ;  ). A linear regression model on the other hand, where each cue is expected to be considered with a weighted linear rule, make no such predictions. The predicted differences in behavioral response, and the better model fit on test-phase data, was used to verify that participants spontaneously adopted an exemplar-based process in this task (see e.g.,  ,  ;  ). \n\nThe critical comparison with regards to the brain imaging data concerned BOLD signal differences between late and early learning. Further characterization of activity changes in the brain regions for which we had   a priori   predictions (i.e., the ventral precuneus, MTL, and the vmPFC) included three   post hoc   tests to explicitly test for changes as a function of learning, and a correlation test to establish a link between the ventral precuneus activity and performance on training items (see section \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d for details). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA total of 34 participants (17 females;   M   = 24.9; Range = 20\u201338 years,   SD   = 4.54) were recruited at Ume\u00e5 University through public advertisement. Participants were right-handed by self-report, met the criteria for MR-scanning (no metallic implants, not pregnant), were neurologically healthy, had no dyslexia or dyscalculia, and had not participated in previous similar studies. All participants provided written informed consent in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. All procedures were approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Ume\u00e5, Sweden. Participants received 500 SEK for participation in the experiment. An extra bonus of maximally 200 SEK could be earned based on performance (  M   = 124.9 SEK  , SD   = 31.29 SEK). \n\nData from seven participants had to be discarded from all analyses: one participant did not reach the learning criterion, and six participants failed to complete all phases of the experiment. One additional participant was discarded from the brain imaging analyses because model fit of final test-phase data was numerically better by the rule-based model than by the EBM (see section \u201cResults\u201d for details). \n\n\n### Design and Materials \n  \nIn a within-subjects design, the task was to learn to judge the toxicity of fictional \u201ctropical death-bugs\u201d on a pseudo-continuous scale with outcome feedback, a task used in several previous studies on multiple-cue judgment to study rule-based and exemplar-based strategies (see e.g.,  ,  ;  ;  ). The toxicity (the criterion) ranged between 2 and 28. The death-bugs differed on four binary cues (i.e., body parts) that affected the toxicity; the legs (long or short), the eyes (big or small), the head (dotted or striped) and the body (blue or purple). \n\nTo induce spontaneous adoption of an exemplar-based judgment strategy, we applied a task manipulation previously successfully used to make participants spontaneously learn to perform multiple-cue judgments with an exemplar-based strategy over a rule-based strategy (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). It has repeatedly been shown that when a linear rule cannot be applied, as for example with a multiplicative relationship between cue and criterion, people tend to rely on exemplar-based strategies instead ( ;  ;  ). To relate to this work, the cue-combination rule used to calculate the toxicity was a multiplicative function of the cues: \n\nwhere each cue,   C   , C   , C  , and   C   could take a cue-value of \u22121 or 1 (see  ). For example, a death bug with the cue values (\u22121, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121) had a toxicity of 2, and a death-bug with the cue-weights (1, 1, 1, 1) had a toxicity of 28 (see  ). The cue weights, as well as which binary feature of the death-bug that implied toxicity, were randomly assigned for each participant. \n  \nStructure of the task used in the experiment. \n    \n\n### Procedures \n  \nThe experiment consisted of four sessions that were administered the same day. Participants began with a   familiarization session   outside the scanner where they were familiarized with the procedure for the fMRI judgment task and a few practice trials related to the cognitive-perceptual baseline task (dot-bug judgment task); judging whether a bug with similar resemblance to the death-bug had gray dots located on its body. The stimuli used in the familiarization session was unrelated to the main task in order to facilitate experience of the trial design and response mode but at the same time maintain novice to the to-be-learnt material before the start of the actual data collection. Participants were then informed about the   fMRI judgment session   where they should learn to judge the toxicity of a number of death-bugs with outcome feedback while being in the scanner. The death-bug judgment task was randomly alternated with the dot-bug judgment task (five items in each learning block) where participants were asked where on a bug dots were located; at the top, the bottom, or both. The structure of the dot-bug judgment task was identical to the death-bug judgment task on all aspects except that no outcome feedback was provided. Participants received no explicit instructions on how to solve the task. \n\nFollowing the fMRI judgment session was a   behavioral judgment session  , including a   final test phase  , where participants continued to make judgments of death-bugs but outside of the scanner. Lastly, there was a   questionnaire session  , where participants answered questions regarding participants background, motivation, task difficulty, and knowledge on how the bodily features of the death bugs affected the toxicity. \n\n#### fMRI Judgment Session \n  \nThe task was displayed on a 32 inches computer screen inside the scanner. The participants viewed the screen through a mirror attached to the head coil. E-prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Inc., United States) was used to control stimuli presentation and logging of responses. A Lumitouch fMRI optical response four button keypad (Photon Control Inc., Canada) was used to collect responses. Participants entered the scanner where they learned to estimate the toxicity of the items from the training set (see  ) with outcome feedback of the correct numerical response. The session consisted of four   learning blocks  , wherein each of the 10 training items (death-bug judgment task) were presented twice in random order, in addition to the dot-bug judgment task (one block totaled 25 number of trials). In between each learning block was an   intermediate test phase  , used for cognitive modeling. See   for an illustration of the experimental design and the fMRI trial design during learning and intermediate test, respectively. \n  \n (A)   Displays the experimental design, with the fMRI judgment session, the behavioral judgment session including the final test phase.   (B)   Displays the trial procedure during the learning blocks of the fMRI judgment session.   (C)   Displays model fit for the cue-abstraction model and exemplar-model on the intermediate tests (denoted T1, T2, T3, and T4) and the final test (denoted FT) reported in RMSD between participants judgment and model prediction. Note that a lower value on the   y  -axis reflects a better model fit. The blue bars display model fit to the cue-abstraction model. The red bars display model fit to the exemplar-based model (EBM). Error bars denote 95% CI around the mean.   (D)   displays performance reported in RMSE (root mean square error) between participants judgments and criteria to the learning criterion has been met (1.5 RMSE). The purple section displays RMSE on learning blocks performed during the fMRI judgment session. White bars display RMSE on learning blocks performed during the behavioral judgment session. Error bars denote 95% CI around the mean. Note that the last two bars include one participant only. \n  \nOn each trial, participants first viewed a small circle in the middle of the screen (8\u201312 s,  ). A gray cross hair (rest) was then presented which after a while changed color from gray to red (after 4\u201312 s). Participants were told to press the key with their right ring finger to indicate that they identified the color change. A probe with information text about the coming task was presented on the screen, either   death-bug   or   dot-bug   (2\u20138 s). Next, the stimuli to-be-judged (either a pictorial death bug or a dot bug) was presented for a maximum of 10 s. Participants were asked to make a judgment while the stimuli were displayed on the screen: either judging the toxicity of the displayed death-bug, or determining where dots were located, and press a button when they had formed their judgment. A jittered cross hair appeared when the button had been pressed or, if no button was pressed, after 10 s, and stayed on the screen for 2\u20136 s. That was followed by a scale where participants used their right-hand fingers to step to the location on the scale that matched their judgment. The scale was either ranging from 0 to 30 (for the death-bug trials) or with three alternatives (for the dot-bug trials; bottom, top or both). When a scale confirmation button had been pressed, or after 10 s, the pictorial death-bug became visible on the screen again together with the participants response and the correct numerical criterion as feedback (for 5 s). This was followed by the next trial (see  ). \n\nOne intermediate test was administered in between each of the four learning blocks that was scanned, yielding a total of four intermediate tests. In each intermediate test, four training items and four new items (denoted New Intermediate in  ) were judged twice in random order without feedback (yielding a total of 16 trials). No brain image acquisition was performed during the intermediate tests, and therefore no jittering was applied (see   for test trial design). \n\n\n#### Behavioral Judgment Session \n  \nThe fourth intermediate test was administered immediately after the fMRI judgment session was completed, and took place in a room next to the scanner. After the fourth intermediate test, participants continued learning to judge the toxicity of the 10 training items until a learning criterion was met (RMSE between criterion and participants judgments \u22641.5 RMSE). The learning criterion was employed to ensure that all participants mastered the task about equally well at the end of learning. \n\nAfter the criterion was met, there was a   final test phase  , where participants judged all training and all new items twice in random order without outcome feedback (see  ). Responses in the final test phase were used for cognitive modeling to confirm that participants had chosen to master the task with an exemplar-based strategy (see section \u201cQuantitative Model Fit\u201d). The trial design of the final test phase was identical to the intermediate test design ( ), but participants had 20 s (instead of ten) to complete the task. The purpose of the additional time was to maximize the quality of the data. \n\nLastly, participants answered a questionnaire with follow-up questions in the   questionnaire session   (results not reported here). \n\n\n\n### Behavioral Data Analysis \n  \n#### Quantitative Model Fit \n  \nAn EBM and a rule-based model (cue-abstraction model, CAM) were implemented in order to infer what strategy participants had relied on (see e.g.,  ,  ;  ;  ). The EBM assumes that judgment is based on the similarity of the to-be-judged stimuli and the memory of previously encountered exemplars (i.e., the training set). The numerical judgment   is determined by: \n\nwhere   N   is the previously encountered exemplars (10 in this particular experiment, see  ),   S   is the similarity between the to-be-judged item and the exemplar   n   and   c   the criterion value of exemplar   n  . The similarity-rule from the original context model ( ) was used to calculate the similarity between a probe and a stored exemplar x : \n\nwhere   d   represents an index of 1 if cue-values on cue-dimension   i   match (  i   = 1, \u2026, I) and   s   [four free parameters in the interval (0,1)] if there is a mismatch. \n\nWith CAM it is assumed that the impact of each cue on the criterion is combined to form a judgment in a linear and additive way, captured by: \n\nwhere the judgment   is a linear additive function of the cues   C  .  k   (the intercept) and \u03c9  (the cue-weights) are free parameters (see  ). \n\nThe models\u2019 were fitted to participants test-phase data using a   leave-one-out   cross validation procedure ( ). For each participant, and for each of the five tests separately (the four intermediate tests and the final test), the models\u2019 free parameters were estimated by fitting both models to all except one of the test items. A prediction for the remaining test item was rendered based on the estimated parameter values. This procedure was repeated for all test items. Unconstrained non-linear optimization with a   simplex   algorithm was used to estimate the parameters (MATLAB Inc., Natick, Mass). Goodness-of-fit was measured as the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the model\u2019s predictions and the participant\u2019s responses. \n\nTo confirm that participants adhered increasingly to an exemplar-based strategy over the course of the four scanned learning blocks, a 2 (CAM vs. EBM) \u00d7 4 (intermediate tests 1\u20134) repeated measurements ANOVA was done with RMSD of the EBM and the CAM, respectively as dependent variables. If the sphericity assumption was violated, corrected statistics using Greenhouse Geisser was applied. Finally, to confirm that participants were better fit by the EBM than the CAM during the final test phase, that is, after the learning criterion had been met, RMSD of the EBM, and the CAM was compared with a paired-samples   t  -test. \n\n\n#### Performance \n  \nPerformance was measured as root mean squared error (RMSE) between the criterion values and participants judgments on the death-bug task. To confirm that learning took place during the four blocks that were scanned with fMRI, RMSE of the four blocks (1\u20134) was entered into a repeated measurements ANOVA. If the sphericity assumption was violated, Greenhouse Geisser corrections were applied. \n\nDifferences in performance (RMSE) on training and new items during the final test phase was investigated with a paired samples   t  -test to accommodate the assumption of performance differences between items acquired during learning and novel test items (c.f.  ,  ). \n\n\n#### Extrapolation Index (EI) \n  \nTo further confirm that the behavioral responses during the final test phase was in line with what can be expected by participants adhering to a similarity-based strategy, we calculated an   extrapolation index   (EI). EI was calculated by (5): \n\nwhere   x   and   x   are a participant\u2019s response on items with the highest and lowest toxicity level, and   p   and   p   are the predicted judgments by linear extrapolation to the same items, where the prediction was based on regressing participants judgments of the ten training items against the criteria (see  ). A total of four deviations per participant (two repetitions of each of the two extreme test items during the final test) was considered, and averaged they constituted the   EI  . If   EI   = 0, this indicates perfect linear extrapolation, and is predicted by an optimal cue-abstraction model. A negative   EI   indicates poor extrapolation behavior and is predicted by the EBM. \n\n\n\n### Neuroimaging Data Acquisition and Analysis \n  \n#### Image Acquisition and Preprocessing \n  \nImages were acquired using a 3.0 T whole body MRI system (MR 750, GE, Medical Systems) with an attached 32 channels head coil. A GE-EPI sequence with the following parameters was used: echo time (TE) 30 ms; repetition time (TR) 2000 ms; flip angle 80\u00b0; field of view (FOV) 25 cm; matrix = 96 \u00d7 96; 3.4 mm slice thickness (37 slices acquired). High-resolution T1-weighted structural images were obtained for each participant. The EPI sequence used for BOLD imaging was applied to acquire T2 -weighted images. Ten dummy-scans were performed to allow for equilibrium of the fMRI-signal before the start of the data collection. To minimize noise inside the scanner, subjects wore earplugs and headphones. Cushions were placed inside the head coil, one at each side, to minimize head movements. Functional data were preprocessed and analyzed using SPM12 (The Welcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, United Kingdom), implemented within an in-house program (  DataZ  ). Images were corrected for slice-timing, head movement were corrected through unwarp, and realignment. Images were spatially normalized with Dartel ( ), transformed to MNI-space, and smoothed (8 mm FWHM Gaussian filter kernel). Statistical analyses were calculated with smoothed data with a high-pass filter (128 s cutoff period) to remove low-frequency noise. \n\n\n\n### General Linear Model Analyses \n  \n#### Changes in BOLD Signal Between Early and Late Learning \n  \nThe primary analyses focused on regions with a different BOLD signal during late learning compared to early learning and was identified by comparing activity from the fourth (last) scanned learning block with the first scanned learning block (i.e., block 4 > 1) and vice versa (i.e., block 1 > 4). \n\nIn the first level analysis, individual general linear models (GLM) were estimated for each participant where the death-bug judgment task events and the dot-bug events during blocks one, two, three, and four were modeled as regressors of interest, and four regressors of no interest; rest (i.e., the cross hair, see  ) on all four blocks. The six movement parameters were included as covariates of no interest. All regressors except those associated with the head movements were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. The duration of all events was modeled by using participants\u2019 response time for each event. For example, the death-bug judgment task events and the dot-bug events were modeled from onset to button press, whereas the rest events were modeled from onset of the crosshair to button press. First level analyses consisted of contrasts comparing death-bug judgment task events from blocks one and four used to identify regions where BOLD signal was higher late compared to early during learning (i.e., block 4 > 1) and BOLD signal that was higher early compared to late during learning (block 1 > 4). Second-level analyses consisted of one sample   t  -tests based on the contrasts defined at the first-level, in a whole-brain analysis. \n\nThree control analyses were performed to test the specificity of results obtained from the primary model for the contrast block 4 > 1. First, a model with the purpose to test if a tighter baseline comparison yielded results consistent with the primary model was defined. The five dot-bug judgment task events from the first learning block (block 1, early dot-bugs) and the five dot-bug judgment task events from the last learning block (block 4, late dot-bugs) were included as separate regressors in the model. A   t  -contrast [(death-bugs block 4 \u2013 dot-bugs block 4) > (death-bugs block 1 \u2013 dot-bugs block 1)] was defined at the first level, and evaluated at the second level in a one-sample   t  -test. Second, the difference between block 1 and 4 for the death-bug judgment task and the dot-bug judgment task [defined as (Task block 4 \u2013 Rest block 4) \u2013 (Task block 1 \u2013 Rest block 1)], respectively, was calculated. The purpose was to evaluate if the learning-related changes in the regions of interest were linked to the death-bug judgment task, and not the dot-bug judgment task, as evaluated with a paired samples   t  -test. Third, in order to investigate whether the effects would change by modeling additional events of no interest we defined a model where three additional regressors of no interest were included: the probe events, the scale events and the feedback events for all learning blocks (see  ). A   t  -contrast (block 4 > 1) was defined at the first level, and evaluated at the second level in a one-sample   t  -test. Note that both models in all other aspects were identical to the primary model. \n\nThe statistical threshold was set to   p   \u2264 0.05 (FDR corrected) at the voxel level and   k   > 0 at the cluster level for the whole brain analyses. \n\n\n####  Post hoc   Analyses \n  \nNext, a set of   post hoc   tests were performed to further characterize the activation pattern observed in the primary analysis where the activation map identified in the former step was used as mask to define our regions of interests (i.e., ventral precuneus, the vmPFC, and the MTL if activity increases, and ventral precuneus if activity was reduced). \n\nFirst, block-wise comparisons were performed to test activity changes between each block (based on death-bug judgment task events >all dot-bug judgment task events), with paired-samples   t  -tests. \n\nSecond, to explicitly test whether there was a link between activity levels in the ventral precuneus and retrieval success (RMSE of old items at the final test, see items denoted T in  ), beta values extracted from the fourth learning block (5 mm radius around the peak voxel) was correlated with RMSE of training items at the final test. \n\nThird, in two parametric analyses we tested for gradual changes between each judgment event (i.e., increases and reductions of the BOLD signal) that might be missed when averaging activity within blocks. The purpose of this approach was related to that repeated judgment continuously improve learning, such that more learning lead to better memory representations that can be retrieved for similarity comparison. First, exponential and linear adaption of the BOLD signal was evaluated separately, and the individual judgment task events (duration modeled as response time), and linear or exponential functions included as a separate regressor in the GLM (see  ). BOLD signal that was affected by the modulator (i.e., displayed a linear or exponential increase in BOLD signal between each death-bug judgment task event) and two contrasts modeling these effects were defined. The six movement parameters were included as covariates of no interest. All regressors except the head movement parameters were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Effects were evaluated with second level one sample   t  -tests. \n\nStatistical threshold for the post-hoc tests were set to   p   < 0.05 (Bonferroni corrected for number of regions,   p   < 0.05/4 =   p   < 0.016) and   k   > 0 at the cluster level. \n\n\n#### BOLD-Signal Differences on the Judgment Task Collapsed Over All Scanned Blocks in Relation to Model Fit \n  \nFinally, it was evaluated whether ventral precuneus activity was significantly higher than baseline across all scanned blocks during death-bug judgments, and in addition if this activity was related to the fit of an EBM during the final test.   recently demonstrated that activity in the ventral precuneus, when making judgments on novel test-phase items, predicted how well an EBM fit the judgment data. To evaluate which brain regions that were overall engaged during all learning blocks, a contrast collapsing all learning blocks, subtracted against the dot-bug judgment task, was defined (All blocks \u2013 All dot-bugs). A one-sample   t  -test at the second level was used to evaluate the contrast in a whole-brain analysis. \n\nFinally, the activation map identified in the whole-brain analysis was again used as mask, and a one-sample   t  -test with the fit of the EBM was used as covariate of interest to test for a functional relationship between model fit and activity levels in the regions of interest that was consistently engaged during learning (ventral precuneus, vmPFC, and the bilateral MTL). Extracted beta values (5 mm radius around the peak voxel) was correlated with RMSD of the EBM on final judgment test-phase data. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Results \n  \n#### Quantitative Model Fit \n  \nWith regard to the diagnostic comparison of model fit during the final test phase, the paired samples   t  -test did importantly confirm that EBM fit participants data better than CAM,   t   (26) = \u221211.21,   p   < 0.001 (see  ). However, one participant\u2019s judgment data was found to have better model fit of CAM than EBM at the final test, and was therefore excluded from the imaging analyses. \n\nThe model fit during the four intermediate tests revealed that participants adhered increasingly to an exemplar-based strategy over the course of the four scanned learning blocks (see  ): a repeated measurements ANOVA with model fit (RMSD of EBM and CAM, respectively) and the four intermediate tests (1- 4) was performed. The ANOVA yielded a main effect of model [  F   = 100.91;   MSE   = 3.69;   p   < 0.001,   = 0.79], and intermediate tests [  F   = 8.97;   MSE   = 8.46;   p   < 0.001,   = 0.26]. There was no significant interaction between model and intermediate test [  F   = 2.36;   MSE   = 3.16;   p   = 0.094,   = 0.83]. In sum, despite the fact that model fit of both models improved as a function of block, fit of the EBM was considerably better than the fit of CAM during all blocks (e.g., the fit of EBM was more than twice as good as the fit of CAM during the fourth intermediate test). \n\n\n#### Performance During Learning \n  \nPerformance (RMSE) as a function of blocks is shown in  . Already during the first four blocks of learning (i.e., the blocks that were scanned) performance was drastically improved. A repeated measurements ANOVA on RMSE as a function of the first four blocks (1\u20134) was performed, reflecting performance during the fMRI judgment session. The ANOVA yielded a main effect of block [  F   = 99.67;   MSE   = 1.48;   p   < 0.001; = 0.79]. Paired samples   t  -tests moreover confirmed significant improvements between each of the first four blocks (all   ps   < 0.05). On average, participants reached the learning criterion (\u22641.5 RMSE) after seven blocks (  M   = 7.4;   SD   = 3.03). \n\n\n#### Performance During the Final Test \n  \nA paired samples   t  -test on RMSE demonstrated that participants were better at judging training exemplars compared to new exemplars in the final test phase,   M   = 1.31,   SD   = 1.1,   M   = 6.8,   SD   = 1.95  , t  (26) = \u221213.3  , p   < 0.001, a typical pattern predicted by EBMs (e.g.,  ,  ). This result hold even when excluding the most extreme extrapolation items with cue values (\u22121, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121) and (1, 1, 1, 1),   M   = 1.31,   SD   = 1.1,   M     = 2.2,   SD   = 1.31  , t  (26) = \u22122.48  , p   = 0.02. \n\nOn average, the   EI   based on judgments of the most extreme novel test items was negative and the confidence interval did not include zero [  M   = \u22123.84; 95% CI (\u22124.9, \u22122.79);   SD   = 2.67], demonstrating that participants were poor at extrapolating outside the acquired learning range. Again, this is a typical pattern predicted by EBMs (e.g.,  ,  ). \n\nTaken together, the behavioral results suggest that participants overall learnt to master the task with an exemplar-based judgment strategy rather than adopting a rule-based judgment strategy. \n\n\n\n### Imaging Results \n  \n#### Changes in BOLD Signal Between Early and Late Learning Blocks \n  \nIf a similarity-based process in the ventral precuneus is key for human judgment, activity changes in the ventral precuneus was expected when learning to master a judgment task. The whole-brain analysis revealed changes between early and late learning (  p   < 0.05, FDR). The contrast (block 4 > 1) yielded effects in a number of large clusters that were more engaged during late learning than early learning (see   for localizations). Of most importance, we observed higher BOLD signal late compared to early learning in the ventral precuneus, the vmPFC, and the bilateral MTL. A number of other regions typically implicated in episodic memory retrieval was also identified, including the temporal pole and insula (see   and   for localizations). \n  \nBOLD-signal changes between early and late learning blocks. \n      \n (A)   Displays the activation map from regions that increased between learning blocks (block 4 > 1), including the ventral precuneus (vP), vmPFC, and the bilateral MTL.   (B)   Displays % bold signal change (  y  -axis) in the ventral precuneus, the vmPFC and the bilateral MTL for each learning block (B1\u2013B4).   (C)   Display a correlation between activity drawn from block four in the ventral precuneus, and performance reported in RMSE of training items at the final test. The   p   < 0.05,   p   < 0.01, and   p   < 0.001. \n  \nPaired sample post-hoc   t  -tests on block-related differences inside the mask revealed that there was a significant reduction in BOLD signal between the first and the second learning block in the vmPFC and the left MTL (all   p\u2019s   < 0.05). Significant increases in the ventral precuneus, the vmPFC, and the bilateral MTL were observed between the second and the third block and the first and the fourth block (all   p\u2018s   < 0.05; see  ). \n\nIn support of the findings from the primary statistical model, all three control analyses yielded overlapping results. First, when contrasting the death-bug judgment task with the dot-bug judgment task, the group-level comparison [i.e., (block 4 \u2013 dot-bugs) vs. (block 1 \u2013 dot-bugs)] revealed an overlapping activation pattern, albeit under a less conservative statistical threshold (see  ). Importantly, the pattern included BOLD signal differences in the ventral precuneus (  x, y, z   = \u22124, \u221254, 22;   t   = 3.05), the vmPFC (  x, y, z   = 6, 52, 10;   t   = 5.08), and the bilateral MTL (  x, y, z   = \u221226, \u221210, \u221228  ; t   = 3.12  ; x, y, z   = 32, \u22128, \u221228;   t   = 2.69). Second, the difference in BOLD activity between blocks 1 and 4 [defined by (Task4 \u2013 Rest) \u2013 (Task 1 \u2013 Rest)] was calculated for the death-bug judgment task and the dot-bug judgment task, respectively. The observed patterns in the regions of interest (ventral precuneus, vmPFC, and MTL) strongly suggested that the learning-related changes between block 1 and 4 were selective (or considerably stronger) in the death-bug judgment task than in the dot-bug judgment task (see  ). Third, including additional regressors in the model yielded virtually identical results as in the primary model, again including the ventral precuneus (  x, y, z   = 8, \u221252, 22  ; t   = 5.03). \n\nReversing the contrast (block 1 > 4) yielded marked BOLD signal differences in one large cluster, including frontoparietal regions and the basal ganglia, distributed over both hemispheres, with the strongest peak in the visual cortex (see  ). Similar activation patterns have previously been observed in frontoparietal networks related to executive demands and cognitive control (see e.g.,  ). Thus, it is plausible to observe reductions in such regions as a function of learning to master a task. No reduction of the BOLD signal in the ventral precuneus was observed under the chosen statistical threshold (see   for localizations). \n  \nThe activation map from regions that reduced between block one and block four (block 1 > 4). \n  \n\n#### Correlational Analysis Revealed a Link Between BOLD Signal in Ventral Precuneus and Performance on Training Items at the Final Test \n  \nAs a next step, we investigated if a link between BOLD level activity in the ventral precuneus could be linked to the process of building memory representations. Correlating activity in ventral precuneus during the last scanned learning block (i.e., block 4) with performance on training items (RMSE) at the final test revealed a strong negative correlation [  r   (24) = \u22120.46,   p   = 0.019], suggesting that the higher the activity level in the ventral precuneus toward the end of learning, the better performance on those same training items during the final judgment test phase (see  ). \n\n\n#### Parametric Analyses Confirmed Gradual Increase of the BOLD Signal in the Ventral Precuneus \n  \nThe parametric method offered further insights into whether the BOLD signal gradually changed between each judgment event. First, parametric   increase   of the BOLD signal was evaluated inside the mask (block 4 > 1). Linear increase of the BOLD signal was observed in the ventral precuneus (  x, y, z   = 2, \u221262, 22;   t   = 3.89;   p   = 0.0003). Exponential increase of the BOLD signal was also identified in the ventral precuneus (  x, y, z   = 0, \u221264, 16;   t   = 2.80;   p   = 0.002) and in the vmPFC (  x, y, z   = \u221214, 74, 14;   t   = 3.35;   p   = 0.0012). No gradual changes were observed in the MTL under the chosen statistical threshold. \n\nParametric   reductions   were also evaluated using the activation map from the contrast (block 1 > 4) as mask. Linear reductions of the BOLD signal were observed, with the strongest peak in the left striatum including the head and body of the caudate (  x, y, z   = \u221220, 16, 8;   t   = 5.54;   p   < 0.001. The exponential parametric analysis also displayed a similar effect, with the strongest peak in the left putamen (  x, y, z   = \u22124, 4, \u22124;   t   = 4.22;   p   < 0.001) whereas no parametric reductions were observed in the ventral precuneus, the MTL or the vmPFC under the chosen statistical threshold. \n\n\n#### A Link Between Exemplar-Based Model Fit and BOLD Signal in Ventral Precuneus During Judgment Learning \n  \nThe whole-brain analysis collapsing all learning blocks against the perceptual baseline task (All blocks \u2013 Dot bugs) demonstrated effects in a large cluster covering both hemispheres, including prefrontal, temporal, and parietal regions. Notably, the strongest peak was located in the ventral precuneus in close proximity to the peak identified in   and the cluster completely overlapped with the cluster identified in the contrast block 4 > 1 reported above (see  ,  ). \n  \nOverall BOLD-signal during learning. \n    \nIn terms of a functional relationship between BOLD activity and model fit of the EBM during the final test, the results revealed negative correlations between BOLD level activity that was consistently engaged during learning and model fit of the EBM in the ventral precuneus [  x, y, z   = 12, \u221252, 10;   r   (24) = \u22120.52;   p   = 0.007] and also in the vmPFC [  x, y, z   = \u221218, 34, \u221212;   r   (24) = \u22120.46;   p   = 0.17] but not in the MTL. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nExemplar-based processes, as captured by EBMs, are important for adaptive human judgment, decision making, and categorization. The ventral precuneus was recently identified as a key brain region for human multiple-cue judgment and brain activity in this region could be linked to how well an EBM fit novel test-phase data ( ). However, further research was needed in order to establish whether the role for this region in exemplar-based judgment processes was related to episodic memory, or rather to visual attention. In the present study we aimed to tackle this question by focusing on changes in BOLD signal over learning in a task where participants were learning to make judgments with an exemplar-based strategy while being scanned with fMRI. Participant\u2019s judgment data at the final test was in line with behavioral predictions of an EBM. In addition, while minor decreases in RMSD as a function of learning is likely to partly reflect reduced measurement error related to the quality of the data as learning progressed, model fit of the four intermediate tests suggested that participants adhered increasingly to an exemplar-based strategy over the course of the four scanned learning blocks. This behavioral outcome was preceded by increased engagement of a large-scale network of brain regions previously demonstrated to be important for episodic memory processes, including the ventral precuneus, the vmPFC and the MTL (see e.g.,  ;  ;  ). Activity levels in the ventral precuneus predicted performance after learning. Moreover, brain activity in ventral precuneus was significantly higher than the perceptual baseline task even when collapsing across all learning blocks. \n\nNeural correlates traditionally expected during episodic memory processes are frequently reported also in research on human judgment, decision making, and categorization ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). For example, the MTL and the vmPFC have been found to be engaged during concept generalization ( ), and the MTL has been linked to similarity-based processes in categorization (see e.g.,  ;  ). The vmPFC has been implicated in response selection (for a review see  ), value comparison, and confidence (e.g.,  ) processes that are important for adaptive decision making. The ventral precuneus has also been reported in tasks expected to pose demands on episodic memory processes, for example when making judgments based on a recognition heuristic ( ), and when categorizing stimuli based on similarity ( ). Moreover, two studies on similarity-based categorization using quantitative measures of EBMs reported ventral precuneus in activation tables, in a task expected to pose demands on episodic memory (e.g.,  ;  ). However, this is to our knowledge the first study that specifically target the potential role for the ventral precuneus in exemplar-based judgment processes. \n\nHow could the link between ventral precuneus and exemplar-based processes be understood? The ventral precuneus, together with the vmPFC and the MTL, has been linked to a network that enables episodic memory retrieval (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). It has been suggested that the ventral precuneus could act as a gateway between MTL and other cortical regions involved in episodic memory processes ( ). The ventral precuneus could also be involved either in directing attention toward internal memory representations stored in the MTL, or in selection and retrieval of memory representations used for decision making (see  ). The precuneus was recently found to be a critical cortical node for coordinating MTL-cortical communication, and stimulation to this region altered memory vividness and ease of recall ( ). Notably, the present study demonstrated that activity levels in the ventral precuneus, the vmPFC and the bilateral MTL increased between early and late learning blocks. Moreover, activity levels in the ventral precuneus toward the end of the learning phase was functionally related to performance at test, demonstrating a typical effect related to retrieval success (see e.g.,  ). Based on the present results, one possibility is that the ventral precuneus is involved in building and retrieving memory representations with the MTL and the vmPFC. Repetition yielded a stronger and more accessible memory representation that could be retrieved for exemplar-based judgment. The parametric increase in the ventral precuneus and the vmPFC, and the link between BOLD activity in the ventral precuneus and performance at the final test, could thus demonstrate a process of aiding retrieval, and response selection of stronger memory representations between trials. For example, exemplar-based processes in the vmPFC corroborates well recent findings linking this region to the level of evidence for similarity-based category decisions ( ;  ). The ventral precuneus was consistently engaged during learning, and activity levels in the ventral precuneus and the vmPFC predicted EBM fit at the final test. This interpretation also connects the present findings to research on categorization focusing on the role of the MTL in building memory representations retrieved for similarity comparison (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). \n\nIt should be noted that the reduction of the BOLD signal between the first and the second learning block suggest that this process might not have been equally engaged during the entire fMRI judgment learning phase. Human judgment and decision making are known to be adaptive, with suggested contingent strategy shifts based on the content of the task (see e.g.,  ,  ;  ;  ;  ; but see also  ;  ). One speculative interpretation of the specific reduction between block one and two could be that participants engaged in a different judgment strategy during the second learning block in order to establish the best strategy to solve the judgment task. However, it should also be noted that the parametric increase in the ventral precuneus and the vmPFC observed from trial to trial suggest that the process of building memory representations needed for exemplar-based judgment might continue at some level, irrespective of eventual strategy shifts. \n\nIn contrast to the robust increase between early and late learning blocks, reductions in activity in brain regions typically implied in a frontoparietal control system were observed between early and late learning (see e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ). Related effects have been observed following extensive practice, and when people learn to cope with novel demands in an effortful task (e.g.,  ;  ). Importantly, we did not observe reduced activation in ventral precuneus as a function of learning under the chosen statistical threshold. The present results thus do not provide evidence for that the key role for ventral precuneus in multiple-cue judgment is related to demanding visuo-spatial attention processes that can be expected to be less demanding over time (see e.g.,  ;  ). It should be noted that one alternative interpretation of the present results could be that the task simply became easier with practice. If so, reduced activation in fronto-parietal regions, and engagement of the ventral precuneus, the vmPFC and the MTL could be a consequence of reduced effort. For example, nodes involved in attention and working memory demanding tasks are anticorrelated with deactivation in several brain regions during such processes, including default mode activation in the medial parietal cortex, the vmPFC, and the MTL ( ). However, increased activity-levels in the MTL and the ventral precuneus over learning is well-established signatures for episodic learning (e.g.,  ). It has also been shown that gradual increases in the precuneus might be diagnostic for rapid creation of memory representations because this predicts successful behavior ( ). Thus, we find it more likely that the observed effect is not a mere consequence of effort, but rather reflects gradual accumulation of stored exemplar representations that guide behavior. \n\nWe did not have   a priori   predictions for all brain regions that exhibited changes over learning. Our choice to focus on the ventral precuneus, the vmPFC, and the MTL was based on the well-known relationship between activity levels in these regions and episodic memory processes (for reviews see e.g.,  ;  ;  ). Nevertheless, future research could aim to specify how other brain regions reported in the present study are related to exemplar-based judgment learning to test the validity of our findings. Regions that could be of particular interest for future research on exemplar-based processes for human judgment is the insular cortex and the temporal pole. For example, the insular cortex has been suggested to be a hub for large-scale brain networks (for a review see  ) and decision making, for example in action selection based on different alternatives (for a review see  ). The insula could in a similar manner support exemplar-based processes for human multiple-cue judgment, by its potential involvement in selection of exemplars used for similarity comparison. The temporal pole is believed to play an important role for memory retrieval of specific memory representations (see e.g.,  ;  ;  ) and has been suggested to be an amodal hub that integrates information that is associated with a concept ( ). \n\nRecently, a large-scale behavioral study where participants made multiple-cue judgments either with rule-based or exemplar-based strategies demonstrated that rule-based and exemplar-based processes draw on different cognitive resources, related to working memory and episodic memory, respectively ( ). The present results thus concur with the conclusions by   and further provide neurocognitive data informative for the link between exemplar-based judgment learning and episodic memory processes. \n\nHow do our results compare to detailed neurocognitive models of category learning? One of the most prominent models is the model COVIS (Competition between Verbal and Implicit Systems) suggesting that two competing neural systems underlie human categorization ( ). COVIS detail that rule-based processes are governed by the prefrontal cortex, and that implicit processes instead rely on the body and tail of the caudate. Recently, it was proposed that exemplar theory should be included in the procedural system of COVIS, where the caudate is linked to mediation of synaptic connections between the striatum and other cortical regions related to experience of the task at hand ( ). Whereas some previous research in line with COVIS have identified gradual increase in the caudate ( ; but see also  ;  ), the present results rather demonstrated reductions in the caudate, both between blocks and parametrically between trials. One interpretation of the present results is that EBMs capture an episodic memory process governed by the ventral precuneus, the MTL and the vmPFC. However, it is possible that EBM fit in procedural learning tasks (e.g., information integration tasks) might correlate more with regions involved in procedural learning, such as the caudate. Exemplar-based processes could in that respect engage different neurocognitive processes depending on the content of the task, which sometimes might require episodic memory, and other times implicit memory. Future studies should be devoted to investigate the link between the caudate, human judgment and the EBMs\u2018 predictions to further clarify this topic. \n\n### Limitations and Future Directions \n  \nOne assumption in categorization ( ) and judgment ( ) is that people often try to identify relationships between cue and criterion when facing a novel task, a so-called rule-bias (e.g.,  ;  ). However, the modeling results in the present study did not give support for a rule-bias; an EBM fit test-phase data better than a rule-based model on all intermediate tests. This result could imply that participants did not engage in initial hypothesis testing, but rather memorized exemplars immediately, supported also with the parametric increase in the ventral precuneus and the vmPFC. Similarity-based processes have been shown to be hard to resist ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and has been argued to be an unavoidable consequence of attending a stimulus in instance learning ( ) which might suggest that an exemplar-based strategy was consistently used. Alternatively, the model fit measure used here is rather coarse, and fine-grained behavioral differences connected to a potential rule-bias within a learning block might have been missed. The observed reduction between the first and the second learning block might for example reflect a dynamic strategy shift related to a rule-bias that was not picked up with intermediate test-phase data. It should however, be stressed that the purpose of the present study was not to focus on dynamic strategy shifts during judgment learning. Further research could implement and test learning models of the assumed processes and relate measures from such models to fMRI data to gain more detailed information related to this question (see e.g.,  ,  ;  ). \n\nOne limitation of the present study is that it was not practically possible to scan the entire learning session, due to the fact that each trial in a multiple-cue judgment task require rather long events. Nevertheless, as was evident in the behavioral data, a large proportion of learning occurred during the first four learning blocks. \n\nThe dot-bug judgment task was included in the experiment to be able to control for sensory-motor activity related to inspecting the visual stimuli and conducting a response. This control task included a limited number of events (a total of 20 events, i.e., 5 per section of the experiment, block 1 \u2013 4). The reasons for including fewer events in the dot-bug judgment task were (i) that the experiment was quite long, and (ii) no learning-related changes for the dot-bug judgment task with unique (not re-presented) items were expected. Still, ideally, the experiment should have included the same number of events (80) in both the death- and dot-bug judgment task. We note this as a limitation of the design, but highlight that the results pattern when the dot-bug events from blocks 1 and 4 were subtracted from the death-bug events indicated that learning-related changes were selective (or considerably stronger) in the death-bug judgment task. \n\nFinally, the main purpose of the present study was to investigate how a similarity-based process in the ventral precuneus, critically suggested to be a key region for similarity-based and rule-based processes in human judgment (see  ) should be understood. The present results suggest that the ventral precuneus is involved in a mnemonic process of building and retrieving memory representations used for similarity comparison in a task designed to capture exemplar-based processes specifically. The extent to which the ventral precuneus contribute to the same cognitive component process in rule-based judgment is unclear. The present results could guide future research to test whether an exemplar-based process in the ventral precuneus is involved also during rule-based judgment learning. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe investigated how the ventral precuneus contribute to exemplar-based processes in human judgment. Focusing on differences in the BOLD signal between early and late learning during similarity-based judgment learning, we investigated implications for this region in mnemonic representational processes. The results showed an increase of the BOLD signal in a parietal memory network related to retrieval success, including the ventral precuneus. Moreover, activity in the ventral precuneus toward the end of learning predicted retrieval success after learning. Thus, our findings indicate that activity levels in the ventral precuneus reflect gradual accumulation of exemplars in memory that could guide behavior, presumably by building memory representations for exemplar-based judgments. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Regional ethical Review board in Ume\u00e5, Sweden.

The present study aimed at offering the first insights into the effects of binge drinking on the neural processing of vocal affect. On the basis of an alcohol-consumption screening phase (204 students), 24 young adults (12 binge drinkers and 12 matched controls, mean age: 23.8\u00a0years) were selected and performed an emotional categorisation task on morphed vocal stimuli (drawn from a morphed fear\u2013anger continuum) during fMRI scanning. In comparison to controls, binge drinkers presented (1) worse behavioural performance in emotional affect categorisation; (2) reduced activation of bilateral superior temporal gyrus; and (3) increased activation of right middle frontal gyrus. These results constitute the first evidence of altered cerebral processing of emotional stimuli in binge drinking and confirm that binge drinking leads to marked cerebral changes, which has important implications for research and clinical practice. \n   Highlights  \n  \nBinge drinking is associated with impaired emotional auditory processing. \n  \nBinge drinkers show reduced superior temporal gyri activity during voice processing. \n  \nThis deficit is compensated by increased activity in right middle frontal gyrus. \n  \nThese brain alterations are parallel to those described in alcohol-dependence. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nBinge drinking refers to repeated alternation between massive alcohol intakes and abstinence periods, and is becoming increasingly prominent among young adults ( ). Its deleterious consequences have been described at medical, cognitive and social levels ( ), but the influence of binge drinking on brain functioning has received only limited attention. However, as it is largely established that long-term excessive alcohol consumption leads to marked cerebral impairments ( ) and as binge drinking might constitute a first step towards alcohol-dependence ( ), young binge drinkers may already present cerebral changes. This proposal is further reinforced by two arguments: First, binge drinking is characterized by repeated alternations between intense alcohol consumption and withdrawal periods which are harmful for brain functioning ( ). Second, the adolescent brain is in an intense neuronal remodelling phase and is thus highly sensitive to the effects of alcohol ( ). \n\nNevertheless, very few functional neuroimaging studies have explored the cerebral consequences of binge drinking habits in humans. Several studies have investigated the cerebral effects of alcohol-dependence in young individuals ( ) or the anatomical consequences of binge drinking ( ) but without exploring the related functional changes. Moreover, electrophysiological studies suggested altered brain functioning in binge drinking but without precisely identifying the brain regions involved ( ). Actually, only five studies have specifically explored the functional correlates of binge drinking using fMRI ( ). These studies showed that binge drinking in adolescence is associated with decreased activity in occipital, hippocampal and prefrontal areas, but with increased activity in amygdala, insula, parietal and superior frontal regions during memory and decision making tasks. While contributing to a better understanding of cerebral changes in binge drinking, these preliminary studies have not answered several crucial questions:   \nIt is unclear whether the cerebral changes observed are specific to the high-level tasks used earlier or would also be observed when other cognitive abilities are required. Specifically, as large-scale emotional impairments have been shown in alcohol-dependence ( ) and as affective deficits have been suggested in binge drinking ( ), the brain deficits may also be present during the processing of emotions. \n  \nMost of these studies focused on adolescent binge drinkers, but this habit is far more frequent among young adults ( ) and the generalisation of earlier results to the global binge drinking population remains unknown. As brain remodelling is more limited among young adults, binge drinking might indeed have less cerebral effects in this population. \n  \nBinge drinkers with current marijuana use ( ) or other drug abuse ( ) have been included in previous studies, and subclinical comorbidities have not always been controlled for, leading to group differences in depression and anxiety ( ). Given that marijuana, subclinical depression and anxiety affect brain activity ( ), the cerebral changes reported might partly be due to these comorbidities. \n  \n\nHere, we used an auditory affective two-alternative forced choice task among young adult binge drinkers without comorbidities and additional drug abuse to avoid the aforementioned shortcomings. Our main hypothesis is that the functional brain changes due to binge drinking, thus far observed during cognitive tasks, are also present in emotional tasks. We specifically hypothesized a reduced performance during auditory emotional processing in binge drinking, associated with a reduced activation of the brain regions classically involved in the processing of vocally expressed emotions. Specifically, earlier studies conducted among healthy participants have shown that the processing of human affective bursts and prosody mainly relies not only on superior temporal gyri ( ), but also on the right middle temporal gyrus ( ) and inferior frontal gyri ( ). Moreover, as our population consisted of young adults without psychopathological comorbidities, the present study will also test whether the deficit observed in previous studies on adolescent binge drinkers can be generalised to the core population of binge drinkers, and whether this deficit persists when comorbidities are controlled for. \n\n\n## Material and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA general screening phase was first conducted among the under- and postgraduate community of the University of Glasgow (United Kingdom). 204 students filled in a questionnaire assessing psychological measures and alcohol-drug consumption characteristics. On the basis of this evaluation, 24 students were selected, fulfilling the following conditions: no positive personal or family history of alcohol-dependence, absence of past or current other drug or psychotropic medication consumption, absence of present nicotine dependence, no major medical problems, no central nervous system disorder (including epilepsy and history of brain trauma), no auditory impairment, low depression (i.e. score lower than 8 at the Beck Depression Inventory, BDI ( )) and anxiety scores (i.e. scores lower than 45 and 52 at the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI A\u2013B ( ), respectively), and right-handedness. \n\nThree variables were used to determine the groups: mean number of alcohol doses per drinking occasion (i.e. per day during which alcoholic drinks are consumed), mean number of drinking occasions per week and consumption speed in doses per hour. One dose corresponds to 10\u00a0g of pure ethanol. According to their alcohol consumption during the last six months, subjects were distributed among two groups of 12 participants (see   for descriptive data): controls (CR; doses per occasion <\u00a02; occasions per week <\u00a01; consumption speed <\u00a01) and binge drinkers (BD; doses per occasion >\u00a05; occasions per week >\u00a03; consumption speed >\u00a02). One-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were performed to check if the participants were correctly distributed across groups. These analyses showed that groups did not significantly differ for age at first alcohol consumption [  F  (1,22)\u00a0=\u00a01.03, NS], but binge drinkers presented as expected higher number of drinking occasions per week [  F  (1,22)\u00a0=\u00a094.78, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001], doses per occasion [  F  (1,22)\u00a0=\u00a072.67, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001], doses per week [  F  (1,22)\u00a0=\u00a035,26, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001] and drunkenness episodes [  F  (1,22)\u00a0=\u00a012.69, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01] than controls, as well as a faster consumption speed [  F  (1,22)\u00a0=\u00a010.05, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01]. Groups were matched for age (age range: 19\u201332\u00a0years in each group), gender (7 males per group) and education. Education level was assessed according to the number of years of education completed since starting primary school. Participants were asked to abstain from any alcohol consumption for at least three days before the scanning session. Before starting the fMRI study, a brief hearing test was performed to ensure that all participants were of normal hearing, and they were assessed for psychological control measures to evaluate subclinical depression (BDI), anxiety (STAI A\u2013B) and current alcohol craving (as assessed by the Obsessive\u2013Compulsive Drinking Scale, OCDS ( )). Participants were provided with full details regarding the aims of the study and the procedure to be followed. After receiving this information, all participants gave their informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were reimbursed \u00a312 for their time. \n\n\n### Stimuli and tasks \n  \nParticipants performed a two-alternative forced choice task regarding one of two emotion categories of morphed affective bursts. Original recordings were taken from the Montreal Affective Voices Battery ( ) in which actors were instructed to produce emotional interjections using the vowel /a/. We chose four identities (two female), each expressing two emotions (anger and fear). The use of auditory stimuli expressing negative emotions is justified by earlier studies showing a strong deficit for the processing of these stimuli in alcohol-dependence and binge drinking ( ). Stimuli were normalised in energy (root mean square) before and after morphing. Angry to fearful continua were created separately for each identity, in seven steps that corresponded to 5/95%, 20/80%, 35/65%, 50/50%, 65/35%, 80/20% and 95/5% fear/anger. The duration of the bursts within each continuum was kept constant (range: .6\u20139\u00a0s). We used STRAIGHT software ( ) for stimulus manipulation and Psychtoolbox3 ( ) for stimulus presentation and response recording. Both programmes are based on MatlabR2009b (Mathworks, Inc.). Acoustic analyses of the stimuli are published elsewhere ( ). \n\nA continuous carry-over design ( ) was employed to control for the effects of one stimulus upon the next using a first-order serially balanced sequence of stimuli known as type-1-index-1 ( ). In this sequence each stimulus is preceded and followed by every other stimulus (seven morph steps and one silence, i.e. a period without auditory stimulation) with an equal number of times, totalling 65 stimuli. The sequence was repeated six times in each of three runs. Each run started with two silences, and each sequence of 65 stimuli was followed by nine TRs of silences. The total number of events per run was thus 446 (each corresponding to one fMRI volume), and the total number of trials for each morph step was 144. \n\nStimuli were presented binaurally using the electrostatic NNL headphone system (NordicNeuroLab, Inc.) at 80\u00a0dB SPL(C). Participants were asked to perform a two-alternative forced choice task in which each affective voice had to be categorised as angry or fearful by means of two button presses mounted on an MRI compatible response box (NordicNeuroLab, Inc.). Subjects had to react as fast as possible and keep their eyes closed. Response to each stimulus and reaction times were recorded. Only correct answers were considered for behavioural analysis. As the 50/50% morph step equally comprises fear and anger, there is no correct response for this level, and it has not been included in the behavioural analyses. Before the experiment, each subject underwent a short training session to practise the task. \n\n\n### Imaging procedure and fMRI data analysis \n  \nScans were acquired in a 3.0\u00a0Tesla Siemens Tim Trio scanner using a 12-channel head coil. Whole brain T1-weighted anatomical scans were performed using fast gradient echo known as T1 \u2018Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo\u2019 (MPRAGE) consisting of 192 axial slices of 1\u00a0mm thickness with an inplane resolution of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 (FOV\u00a0=\u00a0256) and a matrix of 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256 performed at the end of the experiment. T2-weighted functional scans were acquired using an interleaved ascending sequence consisting of 32 slices of 3\u00a0mm thickness (3\u00a0mm gap) with an inplane resolution of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 (FOV\u00a0=\u00a01260) and an acquisition matrix of 70\u00a0\u00d7\u00a070. The three runs (TR\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0s, TE\u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0ms) consisted of 446 volumes each. The presentation of a stimulus coincided with the beginning of the TR. Vocal stimuli ranged in duration between 600 and 900\u00a0ms. A voice localizer scan (TR\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0s, TE\u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0ms, 310 volumes) was performed before the experimental scans, allowing reliable identification of the temporal voice areas using the vocal versus non-vocal contrast ( ). This voice localizer tested whether groups differed concerning basic cerebral activations related to human voice processing. \n\nAll MRI data were analysed using SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, University College London). Pre-processing of functional scans consisted of corrections for head motion (trilinear interpolation) and scans were realigned to the first volume. Functional runs were then coregistered to their corresponding individual anatomical scans. Functional (3\u00a0mm isotropic voxels) and anatomical (1\u00a0mm isotropic voxels) data were transformed to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space after segmentation of the anatomical scans. Normalised data were spatially smoothed by applying a Gaussian kernel of 8\u00a0mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). Condition-related changes in regional brain activity were estimated for each participant by computing the contrasts between the mean hemodynamic responses evoked by each morph step relative to the silent baseline periods between runs. Significant cerebral activations were then examined by means of a full-factorial model with group as between-subjects factor and morph step as within-subjects factor. The statistical threshold was set to p\u00a0<\u00a0.05 FWE-corrected at cluster level for multiple comparisons with a cluster size of at least 10 contiguous voxels. Random effects analyses with one-sample t-tests were also used to explore the global activations found in each group and each emotion type, with statistical threshold set to p\u00a0<\u00a0.05 FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons using cluster size and extending to at least 20\u00a0voxels. Beta-values of the peak activity recorded in the superior temporal and middle frontal gyri were extracted using rfxplot toolbox ( ) in order to perform Pearson's correlations with behavioural data. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and psychopathological measures \n  \nANOVAs showed that groups did not significantly differ for age [  F  (1,22)\u00a0=\u00a0.18, NS], gender, educational level [  F  (1,22)\u00a0=\u00a03.92, NS], depression [  F  (1,22)\u00a0=\u00a02.50, NS], state anxiety [  F  (1,22)\u00a0=\u00a0.44, NS], trait anxiety [  F  (1,22)\u00a0=\u00a0.35, NS] and alcohol craving [  F  (1,22)\u00a0=\u00a01.57, NS], confirming the correct matching of groups. These results are described in  . \n\n\n### Behavioural data \n  \nThese results are shown in  . 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 ANOVAs with morph step (5\u201320\u201335\u201365\u201380\u201395% of fear) as within-factor and group (CR, BD) as between-factor were conducted separately for reaction times and behavioural responses, with post-hoc paired-samples t-tests:   \nReaction times: we found no significant group effect [  F  (1,22)\u00a0=\u00a0.39, NS] and no group X morph step interaction [  F  (5,110)\u00a0=\u00a01.23, NS], but obtained a significant main effect of morph step [  F  (1,22)\u00a0=\u00a094.78, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001] which was due to shorter reaction times to the less ambiguous morphs. \n  \nBehavioural responses: we found no group X morph step interaction [  F  (5,110)\u00a0=\u00a0.73, NS] but a significant group effect [  F  (1,22)\u00a0=\u00a09.62, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01] was identified: BD presented lower correct response rates than CR, independently of the morph step. We also obtained a significant main effect of morph step [  F  (5,110)\u00a0=\u00a024.94, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001], which was driven by higher correct response rates for the less ambiguous morphs. \n  \n\n\n### fMRI data \n  \nThe voice localizer showed the classical activations in areas along bilateral superior temporal sulcus/superior temporal gyrus ( ) for both groups with no significant group differences. The 7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 full-factorial model with morph step as within-factor and group (CR, BD) as between-factor showed two main effects:   \nMain effect of morph step ( , part a): Both anger (i.e. 5\u201320\u201335% morph steps) and fear (i.e. 65\u201380\u201395% morph steps) bursts activated right cerebellum, left inferior frontal gyrus, left supplementary motor area and bilateral superior temporal gyri. Moreover, activations were found in bilateral thalami for anger stimuli and in left insula, right amygdala and right medial frontal gyrus for fear stimuli. The main effect of morph step showed that: (1) anger stimuli led to significantly higher activations than fear ones in left inferior frontal gyrus and supplementary motor area; and (2) fear stimuli led to higher activations than anger in bilateral insula and right medial frontal gyrus. \n  \nMain effect of group ( , part b): Both groups presented significant activations in right cerebellum, right inferior and medial frontal gyri, bilateral superior temporal gyri and left thalamus. Moreover, activations were found in left inferior parietal lobule for binge drinkers. The main effect of group showed that: (1) control participants presented higher activations than binge drinkers in bilateral superior temporal gyri; and (2) binge drinkers presented higher activations than controls in right middle frontal gyrus. These results are illustrated in  . \n  \nNo significant activations were found for the interaction between group and morph step. \n  \n\n\n### Correlational analyses \n  \nPearson's correlations were performed to explore the links between:   \nBehavioural results and cerebral activations: A significant positive correlation was found between behavioural accuracy (i.e. percentage of correct responses) and peak voxel activity in the superior temporal gyri (r\u00a0=\u00a00.435, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), higher activation in the superior temporal gyri thus being related to better performance. Moreover, a significant negative correlation was found between behavioural reaction times and peak voxel activity in the middle frontal gyri (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.387, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), higher activation in the middle frontal gyri thus being related to shorter reaction times. \n  \nSuperior temporal and middle frontal gyrus activations: a significant negative correlation was found between the peak voxel activity in the superior temporal and middle frontal gyri (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.338, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) showing that a reduced activation of the superior temporal gyri is linked with increased activation in the middle frontal gyri. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study was the first to explore the cerebral correlates of emotional processing in binge drinking, and the results clearly suggest that binge drinkers present impaired behavioural and cerebral processing of emotional bursts. At the behavioural level, binge drinkers presented altered processing of negative prosody, which constitutes the primary observation of impaired emotional decoding in this population. At the neuroimaging level, the classical activation pattern related to emotional bursts processing was totally replicated: In both groups, both emotions activated the bilateral superior temporal gyri (the key region for human voice processing ( )) and the left inferior frontal gyrus (involved in the conscious categorization of emotional sounds ( )). Moreover, in line with earlier results, fear led to increased activations in the amygdala, insula and medial frontal gyrus ( ), while anger led to increased activations in the inferior frontal gyrus and supplementary motor area ( ). More centrally, two main group differences were found: (1) Binge drinkers had reduced activations in bilateral superior temporal gyri, which is involved in the processing of affective bursts ( ). This result corroborates behavioural ones and constitutes the first description of the cerebral correlates of impaired prosody processing in binge drinking; and (2) Binge drinkers had increased activations in the right middle frontal gyrus. This region is involved in the processing of the social characteristics of human voice ( ) and is strongly connected with the superior temporal gyrus ( ), but is not directly involved in the decoding of affective bursts. \n\nThese increased frontal activations among binge drinkers reflect the enhanced involvement of alternative areas usually not activated during affective bursts processing, and could index a compensatory activity aiming at counterbalancing the reduced activations in the superior temporal gyri. Earlier studies already showed increased frontal and parietal activations among populations with alcohol-related problems to compensate for impaired temporal activations during memory tasks ( ). The present results reinforce this \u201ccompensation hypothesis\u201d suggesting that binge drinking leads to a double functional change: reduced activation of the areas typically activated during the task and increased activation of alternative regions to compensate for this deficit. This suggestion is further reinforced by the correlational analyses, as they showed (1) that higher activity in the middle frontal gyri is associated with improved performance (i.e. faster reaction times), confirming that increasing the activity of this area can lead to faster emotional processing and (2) centrally, that the activations of the superior temporal gyri and middle frontal gyri are negatively correlated, which support the proposal that the increased middle frontal gyrus activations might compensate altered superior temporal gyrus functioning. Our results also support the \u201ccontinuum hypothesis\u201d ( ) suggesting that binge drinking and alcohol-dependence could constitute two successive steps of a same pathology, leading to analogous impairments. Indeed, as alcohol-dependence is associated with marked emotion decoding deficits ( ) and marked grey matter loss in the superior temporal gyri ( ), the similarities between our results in binge drinking and earlier ones in alcohol-dependence are in line with the proposal of a continuum in the brain deficits between these two populations. This \u201ccontinuum hypothesis\u201d should nevertheless be specifically tested in studies offering a direct comparison between binge drinkers and alcohol-dependent individuals. Moreover, the cerebral correlates of the transition from binge drinking to alcohol-dependence should also be explored, as it could be postulated that binge drinkers are still able to activate alternative brain areas to compensate for impaired activations, while during the evolution towards alcohol-dependence, this compensation might disappear due to the generalisation of brain impairments, particularly in frontal areas ( ). \n\nCentrally, our results confirmed our main hypothesis by showing for the first time that cerebral changes in binge drinking are present not only during cognitive processes but also during affective ones, and that binge drinking is deleterious not only for the adolescent brain but also among young adults. Importantly, the strict control of comorbidities ensures that these cerebral changes observed are related to alcohol consumption per se and not to other drug dependence or psychopathological states. It should however be noted that, while we postulate (in line with earlier longitudinal studies ( )) that these cerebral changes are the direct consequence of alcohol consumption, the reverse causation cannot be totally excluded as several brain modifications could precede and influence the development of binge drinking habits ( ). The absence of group effect concerning current alcohol craving also suggests that the results are not due to stronger alcohol-related thoughts (which might have impaired the performance) among binge drinkers. In view of the limited sample size and variety of emotional bursts, future studies on larger populations are needed to confirm these results, notably to explore the specificity of these deficits for emotional processing (by including control non-emotional stimuli) and the persistence of these brain changes when binge drinking habits end. Moreover, while the participants were repeatedly asked to avoid any alcohol consumption during the three days preceding scanning, the absence of acute alcohol consumption measure at testing day does not allow to totally make sure that no participant had consumed alcohol in the days preceding scanning. Despite these limits, this study clearly shows that binge drinking is associated with impaired emotional processing, as indexed by reduced performance in affective bursts categorization and decreased activations in superior temporal gyri. Moreover, the increased activations in an alternative voice processing network among binge drinkers support the \u201ccompensation hypothesis\u201d ( ) and show that binge drinking leads to a reorganisation of brain functioning, combining reduced and increased activations. \n\nIn conclusion, the present results offer the first insights concerning the cerebral correlates of emotional impairments in binge drinking and could constitute a first step towards the development of the affective neurosciences of binge drinking, potentially bearing crucial fundamental and clinical implications. At the experimental level, this could shed new light on the causes and development of alcohol-dependence by underlining the involvement of emotional impairments in the early stages of this pathology. At the therapeutic level, understanding emotional impairments in binge drinking could assist in the development of prophylactic interventions such as focusing on the rehabilitation of emotional and interpersonal skills. Our results highlight that binge drinking, despite constituting a widespread alcohol consumption habit among young people in Western countries, is associated with deleterious effects at behavioural and cerebral levels. We contribute to a growing body of literature emphasising the urgent need for more education among binge drinkers and for a reconsideration of public health policies among adolescents and young adults. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: t0005\n### Label: Table\u00a01\nUnnamed: 0\tCR (N\u00a0=\u00a012)\tBD (N\u00a0=\u00a012)\nAgeNS\t23.4 (4.21)\t24.2 (4.49)\nGender ratio

We examined brain GABA concentrations and resting activities in post-prandial distress subtype FD (FD-PDS) patients with and without MDD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n24 female age/education-matched FD-PDS with comorbid MDD (FD-PDS-MDD), non-depressed FD-PDS, and healthy controls each were compared on GABA concentrations, resting fMRI (fALFF) in bilateral pregenual anterior cingulate (pgACC), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), insula, and somatosensory cortex (SSC). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nFD-PDS-MDD patients had mild though elevated depressive symptoms. FD-PDS patients had generally mild dyspeptic symptoms. No significant between-group differences in GABA or fALFF were found. No significant correlations were found between GABA and depressive/dyspeptic symptoms after Bonferroni correction. In patients, GABA correlated positively with left insula fALFF (r = 0.38, Bonferroni-corrected p = .03). \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe did not find altered GABA concentrations or brain resting activity in FD-PDS or its MDD comorbidity. The neurochemical link between MDD and FD remains elusive. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFunctional dyspepsia (FD) is a common and chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by symptoms attributed to gastroduodenal origin in the absence of any organic, systemic, or metabolic disease likely to explain the symptoms ( ). \n\nSubstantial evidence exists for gut-brain directed etiological mechanisms in FD, such as infection, inflammatory mechanisms, and altered gut microbiota. On the other hand, associations of FD with personality traits, serotonin polymorphism and experience of childhood adversity provide some evidence for the brain-gut basis to FD ( ). In particular, the significantly increased risk of comorbid Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in community FD samples ( \u2013 ), bidirectional chronological relationship in the respective onsets of FD and MDD in community subjects ( ), and response of non-depressed FD subjects to serotonin-modulating antidepressant drugs ( ,  ) suggested substantial pathophysiological overlap between FD and MDD. In addition, both MDD and FD have been associated with trait characteristics of neuroticism ( ,  ) and alexithymia. Alexithymia has even been shown to contribute to both somatization, depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as suicide risk ( ,  ). MDD has also been associated with trait-alterations in sensory processing patterns unique to the individual ( ) that is akin to the experience-based alterations in salience computation of visceral signals in functional gastrointestinal disorders ( ,  ). Examining neural mechanisms underlying the rich linkages in the FD-MDD comorbidity should help understand the brain-gut mechanisms that determine symptomatology and treatment response. \n\nVisceral, cognitive and emotional processing occurs in cortical glutamatergic networks, including somatosensory cortex (SSC) [Sensorimotor Network (SMN) ( )] that relays visceral sensory input to the Salience Network (SN-insula) which integrates affective and interoceptive information ( ) and send control signals to the (i) the Default Mode Network [DMN: midline structures including perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC)] ( ) and (ii) engages the Executive Network [EN: Dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)]. These glutamatergic networks are modulated by inhibitory GABA-ergic interneurons ( ), in turn innervated by serotonergic neurons at pgACC, VMPFC, and raphe nuclei ( ). Dysfunction in these affective networks may lead to impaired gating of somatosensory signals ( ,  ), contributing to somatosensory amplification ( ,  ) in FD and MDD ( ). \n\nIn MDD, inhibition of GABA-ergic neurons by dysfunctional serotonergic neurons at the pgACC may reduce GABA ( ,  ), in turn disinhibiting glutamatergic neurons and resulting in DMN hyperactivity ( \u2013 ). This altered pgACC GABA/glutamate balance may underlie increased self-focus in MDD and has been suggested to be the neurochemical substrate of antidepressant action ( ). MDD is also associated with resting-state hypoactivity in the EN (DLPFC) ( ,  ) while in the insula, depressive affect is associated with reduced GABA concentration and insula hypoactivity in processing self-related information ( ). \n\nIn FD-PDS, the predominant FD subtype where psychiatric comorbidity is the commonest, resting-state positron-emission tomography (PET) ( ) and functional MRI ( ) showed increased SN, DMN, thalamus, and precuneus resting activity, as well as lowered SMN and SN activation threshold to gastric distension and failure of pain-related pgACC activation ( ). These correlated positively with dyspeptic ( ), anxiety, and depressive symptoms ( ), suggesting abnormal mood-related processing of somatic signals in the SMN, SN, and DMN ( \u2013 ). In our earlier magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study, we found significant increase in SSC glutamate levels in FD that correlated with anxiety and dyspeptic symptom severity but were independent of depressive severity ( ). The short-TE PRESS sequence used for resolving glutamate peaks from glutamine (TR/TE = 3,000/24ms) did not yield accurate measurements of GABA. In fact, there have been no studies on GABA transmission in FD. As such, it is unknown whether FD-PDS would be similar to MDD in GABA-deficit-driven SN and DMN abnormal activities. \n\nIn the present investigation, we used MEGAPRESS ( ) to examine GABA concentrations in major nodes of the SN, SMN, DMN, and EN in matched FD-PDS patient groups differentiated by the presence of MDD, to clarify the pathophysiological abnormalities peculiar to FD and depressive comorbidity. To reduce demand on sample size and owing to evidence showing gender effects in neural activities in the brain ( ), as well as the female predominance in MDD and FD ( ), we decided to perform the study on female subjects only. We hypothesized that altered GABA concentrations in representative regions in the DMN, SN, EN, and SMN would be found amid subjects with FD-PDS with and without comorbid MDD as compared to healthy controls, with those with comorbid MDD showing a greater deficit than their counterparts. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants and Recruitment \n  \nTwenty-six FD-PDS with comorbid MDD (FD-PDS-MDD) and 28 FD-PDS without comorbid MDD were consecutively recruited at a specialist gastrointestinal clinic. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) currently satisfying ROME III criteria for FD-PDS as assessed by a gastroenterologist ( ), (ii) normal oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy results within 2 years from recruitment, (iii) for FD-PDS-MDD group only, comorbid Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD, and (iv) right-handed. Exclusion criteria included having other functional gastrointestinal disorders (irritable bowel syndrome or history of symptoms of acid regurgitation, heartburn or those with abdominal pain as the predominant symptom), consuming drugs that may affect gastrointestinal motility (neuroleptic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin and steroids) within 2 weeks prior to scan, chronic or severe medical conditions, intellectual disability, organic brain syndromes, having other mental disorders including anxiety disorders, psychosis, bipolar disorder, substance abuse, or dependence and presence of any metallic devices or materials in the body that are contraindicated for magnetic resonance imaging. \n\nThirty age-sex-education matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited   via   hospital posters and online advertisements, after a baseline assessment screening against the same exclusion criteria described above, along with any personal history of gastrointestinal complaints and personal or family history of any mental disorders. \n\nTen subjects with excessively noisy MRS spectra were excluded from analyses, resulting in a final sample consisting of 24 subjects per arm. \n\nAll eligible participants provided valid written informed consent. All experimental protocols were approved by the New Territories East Cluster-Chinese University of Hong Kong Clinical Research Ethics Committee and all procedures were performed in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations. \n\n\n### Sociodemographic and Symptomatic Assessments \n  \nSocio-demographic data including age, marital status, employment status, monthly family income, and educational background were obtained using a questionnaire. Diagnoses of MDD and other mental disorders stated within the exclusion criteria were obtained by trained clinician interviewers using the Chinese-Bilingual version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV-TR Mental Disorders-I ( ). Current dyspeptic symptoms and other gastrointestinal disorder symptoms were enquired with a structured Rome III symptom assessment questionnaire. Dyspeptic symptom severity was measured with the dyspepsia items from FGI-Checklist, a validated 20-item structured questionnaire assessing common upper and lower gastrointestinal symptoms ( ), each self-rated on a scale of 0 to 3.\u00a0A global dyspeptic symptom severity score was generated by averaging the scores for the items included. Current depressive and anxiety symptoms were evaluated with the commonly-used interviewer-administered scales of MADRS ( ) and HAM-A ( ), respectively. MADRS consists of 10 items rated on a 0 to 6 continuum that evaluate core symptoms of depression, with a total score of 7\u201319 denoting mild depression, 20\u201334 for moderate depression, and >34 for severe depression. HAM-A consists of 14 items on psychic and somatic aspects of anxiety, each rated from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score of <17 denoting mild severity, 18\u201324 for mild to moderate, and 25\u201330 for moderate to severe. Interoceptive awareness was measured using the Body Perception Questionnaire, a 122-item self-report instrument consisting of subscales on body awareness, stress response, autonomic nervous system reactivity, stress style, and health history, respectively ( ). General severity of somatic symptoms was measured using a Chinese version of the 15-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15) which has been validated in the local community, showing satisfactory reliability and validity ( ). General health-related quality of life was measured by a validated Chinese version of the Short-form-36 health survey (SF-36) ( ). Current medication history was enquired and checked with hospital records. The Three-subtest Short Form of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III ( ) was conducted on all participants at baseline to control for confounding effects of intelligence on scan results. \n\n\n### Imaging \n  \nAll imaging protocols were performed using a 3 Tesla MRI scanner (Achieva TX series, Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands). \n\n#### Anatomical MRI \n  \nHigh resolution structural images were acquired using an eight-channel receive-only head coil using a sagittal 3D T1-weighted sequence (TR/TE: 7.4/3.4 ms; field of view: 250,250 mm, 285 contiguous slices, 0.6-mm (RL) thickness, reconstruction matrix: 240,240, flip angle 8\u00b0). T1-weighted images were segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) maps using SPM12 ( ). GM volume of each MRS volume-of-interest (see below) was extracted using FSL ( ). \n\n\n#### Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy \n  \nAnatomical MRI images were used to guide positioning of MRS volumes-of-interest in bilateral pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), left insula, left SSC, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The bilateral pgACC voxels (30\u00a0mm \u00d7 30\u00a0mm \u00d7 30\u00a0mm) were positioned bordering the lower edge of the genu of the corpus callosum and with its posterior limits just touching the anterior border of the genu of the corpus callosum ( ) ( ). The left insula voxels (25\u00a0mm \u00d7 40\u00a0mm \u00d7 25\u00a0mm) were aligned along the edge of the insula cortex in an anterior-posterior direction with the anterior edge of the volume-of-interest aligned to the anterior limit of the insula ( ) ( ). The left SSC (30\u00a0mm \u00d7 30\u00a0mm \u00d7 30\u00a0mm) was placed on the post-central gyrus (Brodmann areas 1, 2, and 3) ( ) ( ). The left DLPFC (30\u00a0mm \u00d7 30\u00a0mm \u00d7 30\u00a0mm) was placed in the left inferior frontal gyrus between the inferior frontal sulcus and horizontal ramus ( ) ( ,  ). \n  \nPositioning of regions of interest in fALFF (Top) and MRS (Bottom) for   (A)   bilateral pregenual anterior cingulate cortex,   (B)   left insula,   (C)   left somatosensory cortex, and   (D)   left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. \n  \nSignal reception for H-MRS were achieved using the same eight-channel received-only head coil under the following parameters: TE, 68 ms; TR, 2,000 ms; 400 transients of 4,096 data points acquired in 12\u00a0min; 14-ms Gaussian editing pulses to be applied either to the GABA spins (at 1.9 ppm) or symmetrically about the water peak (7.5 ppm) in an interleaved manner. A further eight transients were acquired, without water suppression, as an internal concentration reference. \n\nGABA concentrations in the 4 volumes-of-interest were gauged as GABA signal intensities relative to water, as derived from GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS MRS spectra using Gannet v3.0 ( ). GABA signal was scaled to account for the fraction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the voxel, and the water signal was scaled to account for the different water content in CSF, gray, and white matter. A concentration measurement in institutional units is derived from the ratio of the GABA and water signals by further adjusting for the editing efficiency and the T1 and T2 relaxation times of water and GABA. The overall fit errors, represented by the standard deviation of the fitting residuals relative to the GABA and water fitting peaks, converged to mean values of 6.5%, 5.1%, 5.3%, and 4.1% for left DLPFC, left insula, pgACC, and left SSC, respectively. \n\n\n#### Functional MRI - fALFF \n  \nSubjects were instructed to have their eyes closed for 6\u00a0min and hold still without falling asleep. Resting fMRI data was collected with a single-shot echo-planar sequence sensitive to BOLD contrast (TR, 2,050 ms; TE, 25 ms; flip angle, 90\u00b0; slab thickness, 150\u00a0mm; field of view, 205\u2019 205\u00a0mm; image matrix, 6,464; parallel imaging acceleration factor of 2) to acquire 150 dynamic scans under each condition. BOLD images acquired had a nominal in-plane resolution of 3.23.2\u00a0mm and a temporal resolution of 2 s per dynamic scan. \n\nThe first three volumes were removed to eliminate the effects of start-up transients. Resting-state imaging data were preprocessed using AFNI (Analysis of Functional Neuro-Images) ( ). Preprocessing steps included slice-timing correction, alignment between the structural image and the third functional volume, estimation of motion correction parameters (three translational and three rotational components) that co-register each functional volume to a reference volume with the lowest motion, and warping structural image to the Talaraich space. Fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) were derived from the rsfMRI data using AFNI\u2019s 3dRSFC program ( ,  ). First, each voxel time series was converted into the frequency domain (0\u20130.25 Hz) using a fast Fourier transform without band-pass filtering and the square root of each frequency of the power spectrum was calculated. Second, each voxel time-series was band-pass filtered (0.01\u20130.10 Hz) before converting to the power spectrum and the sum amplitude of this low frequency domain was calculated. Finally, the ratio between the sum amplitude of the low frequency domain and the full frequency domain was extracted for each voxel. Also, mean fALFF was calculated for each volume-of-interest. \n\n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nBaseline demographic characteristics were compared between the three arms using chi-square and one-way ANOVAs as appropriate. \n\nMean GABA concentrations were compared between the three groups using generalized estimating equations, ANCOVA, and a t-test where healthy controls were compared against a combined patient group (FD with comorbid MDD + pure FD). Generalized estimating equation analyses were all adjusted for age, IQ, and same-region GM volume, whereas ANCOVA and t-test included any of these covariates only when correlation with GABA concentration was presented. \n\nPearson correlation was used to identify relationships between GABA concentrations of each region with dyspeptic severity (FGISQ), introspective awareness (BDQ), depressive severity (MADRS), anxiety severity (HAMA), somatization (PHQ15), health-related quality of life (SF36), and same region fALFF. For each VOI, the mean fALFF was extracted and its correlation with same-region GABA concentrations was examined by Pearson correlation, corrected for age, IQ and same-region GM volume, or any combination therefor, whichever correlated with GABA concentration. All correlation analyses were performed across the whole sample, for each patient group individually, and for a combined patient group (FD-PDS and FD-PDS-MDD). \n\nBetween group mean difference of fALFF was assessed using voxel-wise permutation analysis, corrected for the effect of age, IQ and same-region GM volume. \n\nIBM SPSS Statistics v23 for Windows was used for all statistical analyses. Results of p < 0.05 were considered significant. All tests were two-tailed. To account for multiple comparisons in four ROIs, Bonferroni correction was applied to all statistical analysis involving GABA and fALFF. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographics \n  \nTwenty-four female subjects were recruited in each group: 1. FD-PDS patients with comorbid MDD (FD-PDS-MDD), 2. FD-PDS patients without MDD (FD-PDS), and 3. healthy controls (HC). 10 subjects with noisy MRS spectra were excluded (see   Materials and Methods  ). All subjects were female and had a mean age of 42.44 and on average 11.86 years of education. Over half of the sample were married and had full-time employment. No significant differences were found in age, education, marital status, and employment status between the 3 groups ( ). \n  \nDemographics. \n  \n*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. \n  \n\n### Clinical \n  \nFD-PDS-MDD patients had a mean Montgomery\u2013\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) scores of 18.01 (SD 6.08) and 15.38 (SD 7.1), which were within the mild range ( ,  ). These were significantly greater than the FD-PDS group (ps <.001) and HC (ps < .001) ( ). \n\nPatients had generally mild dyspeptic symptoms. On a composite score of current dyspeptic symptom derived by summing self-rated scores on four dyspeptic symptoms ( ) (epigastric pain, epigastric burning, postprandial fullness, early satiety), FD-PDS patients with and without MDD comorbid showed significantly elevated dyspeptic symptoms compared to HC (p < 0.001), while no significant differences were found between FD-PDS and comorbid FD-PDS-MDD patients ( ). \n\n\n### Group Difference in GABA Concentration and fALFF \n  \n shows the GABA concentration in different VOIs in the three groups. No significant differences were found between the three groups in GABA concentrations in any of the voxels of interest, using AN(C)OVA ( ), generalized estimating equation ( ), or in the T-test comparing HC against a combined patient group ( ). \n  \nGroup difference in GABA/water in four regions of interest: left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left insula, bilateral pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, and left somatosensory cortex. \n    \nGroup difference of GABA/water. \n  \nLevene's test confirmed equal variances across groups. \n\nCovariate: IQ. \n\nAdjusted for age, gray matter volume in same-region MRS ROI and IQ. \n    \nGroup difference of GABA/water between healthy controls and combined patient group tested with t-test (n = 72). \n    \nNo significant difference was found in fALFF among the three groups in any of the four regions examined (5,000 permutations, adjusted for age, IQ, and same-region GM volumes) ( ). \n  \nGroup difference of fALFF from voxel-wise permutation analysis. \n    \n\n### Correlations Between GABA Concentration and Clinical Measurements \n  \nNegative correlations of left insula GABA with dyspeptic symptom severity for FD-PDS-MSS (r = \u22120.49, corrected p = 0.06) and across all patients (r = \u22120.35, corrected p = 0.06) became insignificant after correction for multiple comparison ( ). The negative correlation between bilateral pgACC GABA and anxiety symptoms also rendered insignificant after Bonferroni\u2019s correction (r = \u22120.29, p = 0.19) ( ). \n  \nCorrelations between GABA/water and clinical measures. \n  \nMRS ROIs tested: left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left insula, bilateral pregenual anterior cingulate, left somatosensory cortex. \n\nClinical measures tested: FGISQ, Functional Gastrointestinal Standard Questionnaire; BPQ, Body Perception Questionnaire; MADRS, Montgomery\u2013\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale; HAMA, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale; PHQ15, Patient Health Questionnaire-15; SF36, 36-item Short Form Survey. \n  \nNo correlations between GABA and health-related quality of life, somatization and introspective awareness were found. \n\n\n### Correlations Between GABA Concentration and fALFF \n  \nIn the combined patient group (FD-PDS and FD-PDS-MDD), left insula GABA correlated with same-region fALFF (r = 0.38, corrected p = 0.03) ( ). \n  \nCorrelations between GABA/water and same-region fALFF. \n  \n*Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05. \n  \nThere were no significant GABA-fALFF correlations in any regions within each patient group or across all subjects. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis is the first study reporting on GABA concentrations in the major somatic-cognitive-affective network in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders. We failed to find any evidence for altered GABA concentrations in representative regions in the DMN, SN, EN, and SMN in these age/education-matched group of female subjects with FD-PDS with or without comorbid FD-PDS, and healthy subjects. As such, the neurochemical link between FD-PDS and MDD remains elusive. \n\nIn measuring GABA concentrations, we used MEGAPRESS which is the standard tool in resolving GABA and with which significant differences had been detected in the DLFPC, pgACC, insula, and somatosensory cortices in ( ) patients with various psychiatric conditions using comparable parameters ( \u2013 ). We only included subjects with good spectral quality into the analysis; therefore, poor spectral quality, which would have ensued from poor voxel placement, was unlikely to explain the unequivocal findings. \n\nThis could be a case of type-II error, although sample size calculation based on previous depression study (GABA = 0.89 (sd = 0.11) in MDD, 1.0 (sd = 0.11) in controls, Cohen\u2019s d = 1.0) showed that 17 subjects were already sufficient to achieve a power of 0.8 with type I error = 0.05 ( ). However, the dyspeptic subjects had largely mild dyspeptic severity and for the comorbid MDD group, all met DSM criteria for MDD but also with mild-to-moderate severity of depressive symptoms. While, in lieu of precedence, no comparison can be made with GABA concentrations in other studies on FD, our comorbid FD-MDD did not show changes in GABA in SN ( ), DMN ( ,  ), and EN ( ,  ) reported in previous studies on depressed patients. \n\nAlthough we used rigorous recruitment assessment for DSM-IV-TR MDD, and Rome III FD-PDS, with negative upper endoscopy results in all recruited dyspeptic subjects to minimize recruitment error, by excluding subjects on centrally-acting drugs we might have recruited subjects with milder symptoms, which may not represent the full spectrum of clinical severity we usually see in our patients. GABA deficit may be obvious only in more clinically severe patients. In order to elucidate the role of GABA in the FD/MDD comorbidity, it is likely that a much larger sample size would be required. \n\nWe found, only in depressed dyspeptic subjects, subsignificant negative correlation of GABA concentration in left insula with dyspeptic symptoms. This would require examination in a larger sample to ascertain if SN GABA deficit actually contributed to somatic symptoms, as previous studies on depression suggested ( ). However, the weakly positive correlation between GABA concentration with fALFF contradicted the possibility of GABA deficit driving these symptoms by reduction of its inhibitory drive ( ,  ). Further examination in larger, well-defined clinical samples would help test against the possibility of spurious associations linked to multiple testing and small sample sizes. \n\nEven more difficult to explain were the unequivocal findings in ALFF from resting state fMRI in all of the regions of interest. This contradicted with two previous reports ( ,  ) showing significant increase in SN and DMN resting activity in FD. It is unclear if the difference was attributed to the sample sizes in the dyspeptic comparison arms (40 in Zeng et\u00a0al., 49 in Liu et\u00a0al., both from the same group of investigators). Nevertheless, earlier PET-CT studies were not in agreement on resting state findings. One research group in Sichuan reported increased resting activity in pgACC, insula, SSC, and thalamus in FD-PDS patients, positively correlating with dyspeptic symptom severity ( ), while the Leuven group reported reduced somatosensory, insula, and cingulate resting glucose metabolism ( ). Notwithstanding the fine rigor in these experiments, reports on resting state fMRI changes in FD have remained sparse. Worryingly, after the publication of a number of highly influential studies earlier in the past decade, few if any further neuroimaging studies on FD have been published in the recent few years. \n\nIf we accept the validity of our results, their conflict with existing reports may be reconcilable with the complex gut/brain origins of FD and the vast heterogeneity of its pathophysiology across different patients. This may not be entirely surprising if randomized controlled trials of central serotonergic agents have so far reported conflicting results ( ,  ,  ). Replication of the previously reported resting state activity findings on larger, cross-national samples including patients of different sociodemographic characteristics and clinical profiles and subsequently, meta-analytic examination will be warranted. \n\nApart from sample size and potential recruitment bias as mentioned above, our investigation also suffered from a few limitations. Firstly, we did not include a group of MDD-only subjects with no FD and low on somatic symptom scores. Given that somatic symptoms are common in MDD and are even considered a marker of depressive severity ( \u2013 ), it would be hard to presume that MDD-only patients without somatic symptoms such as dyspepsia would have more abnormal brain GABA and resting state activity findings. Secondly, we only examined resting-state activity but did not examine brain activations to gastric stimuli. Although significant correlation of anterior cingulate resting activity with regional GABA concentration has been demonstrated ( ), GABA was linked to altered task-dependent insula activation in an interoceptive awareness paradigm ( ). It should be of interest to examine the link of GABA with task-dependent activation in FD and MDD ( ). Thirdly, owing to time constraints, we only included voxels on the left side of the brain (apart from pgACC which was bilateral) considering the vast literature reporting left EN underactivity in major depression ( ), but considering the bilateral involvement of prefrontal resting activity reported in FD ( ), including right-sided DLPFC, insula and somatosensory voxels may reveal different GABA-resting activity interactions in the FD-MDD comorbidity. Lastly, the present study was planned for comparison of regional GABA concentration and their respective correlation with resting-state activity measure (fALFF). A larger sample size, would be preferred for examination of the correlation of regional GABA concentration with functional connectivity measures in the various different networks owing to the increased number of comparisons involved ( ). \n\nIn summary, we were unable to identify significant GABA alterations or any contingent changes in resting brain activity in FD-PDS nor could we identify any impact of the FD-depressive comorbidity on neural activity and brain GABA concentrations in the major affective-cognitive-somatosensory networks. FD is a complex and heterogeneous disease of the brain-gut axis ( ) with a link to depression\u2014from etiology to treatment\u2014that is fascinating and intriguing. It is possible that the main cortical neurochemical disturbance in FD is glutamatergic ( ). A study with larger sample size to delineate the stimulus-dependent activity/glutamate-GABA interactions in the anterior cingulate and bilateral brain networks on patients of a more representative spectrum of clinical severity is clearly indicated. Until then, the foundations for FD to hold claim as a brain-gut disorder will remain uncertain. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets involved in the study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by New Territories East Cluster- Chinese University of Hong Kong Clinical Research Ethics Committee.

However, some basic psychophysical tasks in visual perception do not give rise to this expected effect, at least not in the visual cortex. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record brain activity while systematically manipulating task difficulty in a motion discrimination task, by varying the angular difference between the motion direction of random dots and a reference direction. We used both a blocked and an event-related design, and presented stimuli in both central and peripheral vision. The behavioral psychometric function, across angular differences of 3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, 15\u00b0, or 80\u00b0, spanned the full response range, as expected. The mean blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals were also correlated within-participants between the blocked and event-related designs, across all brain areas tested. Within the visual cortex, the voxel response patterns correlated more within-conditions (e.g., 3\u00b0 and 3\u00b0) than between-conditions (e.g., 3\u00b0 and 9\u00b0), in both designs, further attesting to the reasonable quality of the BOLD data. Nevertheless, the BOLD-o-metric functions (i.e., BOLD activity as a function of task difficulty) were flat in the whole-brain and region-of-interest (ROI) analyses, including in the visual cortex, the parietal cortex, in both designs, and in foveal and peripheral visual fields alike. Indeed, there was little difference between BOLD activity during the 3\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 conditions. Some suggestive evidence of difficulty modulation was revealed only in the superior and inferior frontal gyri for the blocked design. We conclude that, in motion discrimination, there is no systematic BOLD modulation that accompanies the standard psychometric function across different hierarchies of cortical areas, except for the frontal lobe of the brain. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nTask difficulty has been found to qualitatively change the way the brain functions, according to the existing literature. The reverse hierarchy theory of visual perceptual learning, proposed by Ahissar, Hochstein [ ], suggests that different visual hierarchies, involved with the learning of easy tasks and difficult tasks, show generalization and specificity, respectively. Other perceptual learning studies provided further evidence of a difficulty effect by showing different learning and transfer effects for easy and difficult tasks, across multiple task types such as motion discrimination [ , ] and orientation discrimination [ ]. These behavioral effects suggested that brain activity was likely also modulated by task difficulty and raised an important question concerning the neural processing of visual stimuli. \n\nBrain imaging studies have shown that task difficulty affects brain activity in a variety of tasks. fMRI studies have suggested that, in general, task difficulty changes the BOLD responses mostly in frontal and parietal cortices. For example, in a working memory task, activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and other regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was found to increase with increasing task difficulty, manipulated by adjusting the degree of stimulus degradation [ ]. Attentional load related difficulty in a visual tracking task was also found to affect the activation in the parietal and frontal cortical areas, including the superior frontal sulcus (SFS) [ ]. Other studies concerning the effect of task difficulty on neural responses consistently demonstrated that the responses of frontal, parietal, and cingulate cortices were affected by task difficulty, across a variety of cognitive tasks including working memory [ , , ], language [ \u2013 ], time perception [ , ], and visual attention [ , ]. Generally speaking, the frontal lobe was recruited in diverse cognitive demands and thus showed sensitivity to task difficulty [ ]. \n\nIn addition to fMRI studies, electroencephalograph (EEG) studies showed that when an oddball task became more difficult (as the sizes of target and distractor stimuli became more similar), the distractor P3a amplitude increased while the target P3b amplitude decreased [ ]. The generators of these P3 components were suggested to lie bilaterally in the frontal, parietal, and temporal areas using fMRI-constrained source analyses [ ]. Besides P3a and P3b, the amplitude of another late component termed D220 was found directly proportional to the difficulty levels of decision making [ ], which indicated that difficulty might influence the late stage of visual processing. Furthermore, a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) study in 107 subjects also showed that significant increases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ACC were more likely to occur during difficult tasks [ ]. Converging evidence, therefore, demonstrates the close relationship between task difficulty and neural activity in higher-level cortical areas such as the frontal, parietal, and cingulate cortices, in multiple tasks. \n\nPrevious studies investigating task difficulty focused primarily on the frontal and parietal cortices, outside the sensory cortex. The current evidence as to whether task difficulty modulates the activity of lower-level visual cortices, however, is less consistent. A single-cell recording study in rhesus monkey V4 neurons showed that neuronal responses to stimuli became larger and more selective when the visual discrimination task was more difficult [ ]. However, ultimately the increasing amount of attention, rather than discrimination difficulty, was found to enhance the responsiveness and selectivity of the neurons processing the stimulus. The influence of task difficulty on rhesus monkey V1 neurons was also modulated by spatial attention, with an increase in firing rate at the focus of attention and a suppression in surrounding regions [ ]. In addition to neurophysiological studies, fMRI results showed that the base responses in V1, V2, and V3 depended on task difficulty, with activity decreasing as the pattern-detection task became easier [ ]. However, several other fMRI studies suggested that task difficulty did not change the BOLD responses. Sunaert et al. [ ] found that increasing the difficulty of a motion speed discrimination task had little effect on the BOLD responses in visual areas. Only dorsal V3 showed a weak difficulty effect. Furthermore, Ganis et al. [ ] found that no activation in the brain could be predicted by the response time (an indicator of task difficulty) of visual imagery and visual perception tasks. Other fMRI studies, using ROI analyses, also showed a null effect of task difficulty on the activity in the human visual cortex. For example, manipulation of the angular size in an orientation discrimination task gave rise to flat BOLD responses in V1, V2, V3a, V3b, and V4 [ , ]. Taking these findings together, there is still no consensus about the effect of task difficulty on the neural responses in the visual cortex. \n\nAt present, brain imaging studies mainly rely on univariate analysis and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to quantify the effect of some variable on brain activity. In visual discrimination tasks, difficulty is often increased by decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the stimuli, thus requiring more effort and more attentional resources from the participant. As a result, greater brain activation is expected to take place as measured by the fMRI BOLD peak. The current study was designed to test whether there is a systematic univariate change in brain activity as a function of the difficulty of a motion discrimination task, as defined by the angular difference in motion direction discrimination. Note that the meaning of task difficulty varies greatly, depending on how it is defined in a specific task. The motion discrimination difficulty has never been studied by fMRI previously. Therefore, although we would expect a similar modulation effect in the frontal and parietal cortex, such an effect is not necessarily guaranteed, since no existing evidence supports the difficulty effect per our definition of difficulty. \n\nThe difficulty effect found in previous studies may result from the ways in which they manipulated task difficulty. These manipulations may not only vary the difficulty levels, but also introduce confounding factors such as different perceptual loads or different physical properties of stimuli (e.g., contrast, coherence level in dot motion). In addition, previous studies testing the effect of task difficulty may have focused only on the visual cortex [ , ]. Furthermore, it is not known how the trial-structure of an experiment (e.g., blocked versus event-related design) affects attentional load. More specifically, in a blocked design, the attentional demand may be different between an easy and a difficult block. In an event-related design, however, since the difficulty level of each trial is unpredictable, the attentional demand is expected to be approximately equal between easy and difficult trials. In the current study, we adopted a motion direction discrimination task, where task difficulty was manipulated by changing the directional difference between a motion stimulus and a reference. This manipulation kept the physical stimuli nearly the same between different difficulty levels. Using fMRI, we measured brain activity across visual cortical areas in both the ventral and dorsal visual streams, and in multiple higher-order cortices. We also performed a whole-brain analysis to search for difficulty-level-related areas across the entire brain. In addition to these univariate analyses, we also performed MVPA to investigate the activity patterns in the visual cortex at different difficulty levels. We presented stimuli both in the fovea and in the periphery (in a supplementary experiment), to further inspect the difference between foveal and peripheral visual processing. An additional series of analyses, including applying spatial smoothing to fMRI data, comparing between the easiest and most difficult conditions directly, conducting denoising methods to improve fMRI data, as well as selecting the best participants and better ROIs, were implemented for further investigation into our data (see Supplemental Material 5). \n\nOur results showed that even though the activity patterns in the visual cortex changed with different difficulty levels in the MVPA analysis, the brain activity as measured by univariate BOLD signals was invariant to task difficulty across different hierarchies of cortical areas, except for some superior and inferior frontal areas in the blocked design. In the visual cortex, the null effect of task difficulty was robust for both blocked and event-related designs, and in both foveal and peripheral visual fields. \n\n\n## 2. Experimental procedures and results \n  \n### 2.1. Experimental procedures \n  \nDuring fMRI scanning, 24 participants (14 for Experiment 1, 10 for Experiment 2; 9 males) performed a motion direction discrimination task, in which they judged whether the motion direction of a random-dot kinematogram (RDK) stimulus was clock- or counter-clockwise relative to a static reference direction ( ). Four more participants performed a Supplementary Experiment, in which the RDK was presented in an annular region in the peripheral visual field, instead of the foveal visual field ( ). The task difficulty was manipulated by changing the angular difference between the reference and RDK directions (3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, and 15\u00b0 in Experiment 1; 3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, 15\u00b0, and 80\u00b0 in Experiment 2 and Supplementary Experiment). Both blocked and event-related designs were applied in all three experiments. All participants gave written, informed consent in accordance with the procedures and protocols approved by the human subject review committee of Peking University, Beijing, China. \n   Stimulus and schematic description of a trial.  \n(A) Experiments 1 and 2: In each 3 sec trial, a cross was first presented at the center of the screen for 600ms. Its longer arm indicates the reference direction. After this reference, an RDK motion stimulus in a circular region with a radius of 4\u00b0 was presented for 200ms. Participants discriminated whether the motion direction was clockwise or counterclockwise of the reference. The motion directions of RDK were 3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, 15\u00b0 from the reference in Experiment 1, and 3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 80\u00b0 from the reference in Experiment 2, corresponding to the three and four levels of difficulty. (B) Supplementary Experiment: The moving dots of RDK were restricted to an annular region with an outer radius of 8\u00b0 and an inner radius of 4\u00b0. The stimuli and experimental design were otherwise the same as in Experiment 2. \n  \n\n### 2.2. Behavioral results \n  \nIn Experiment 1, we measured participants\u2019 accuracy (percent correct choices) across the three difficulty levels (3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, and 15\u00b0), separately for the blocked and event-related designs. The accuracies averaged across all participants for the 3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, 15\u00b0 conditions were 60.9%, 77.4%, 87.3%, respectively, for the blocked design (repeated-measures ANOVA, F(2, 26) = 114.9, p < 0.001; post-hoc paired t-test, all t(13) > 7.8, p < 0.001) ( ); and 62.8%, 79.7%, 88.2% for the event-related design (repeated-measures ANOVA, F(2, 26) = 117.0, p < 0.001; post-hoc paired t-test, all t(13) > 6.2, p < 0.001) ( ). In Experiment 2 there were four difficulty levels (3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, 15\u00b0, and 80\u00b0) for both blocked and event-related designs. The accuracies averaged across all participants for the 3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 80\u00b0 conditions were 57.5%, 74.5%, 85.1%, 96.0% for the blocked design (repeated-measures ANOVA, F(3, 21) = 121.2, p < 0.001; post-hoc paired t-test, all t(7) > 5.3, p < 0.001) ( ); and 59.1%, 74.9%, 84.1%, 95.4% for the event-related design (repeated-measures ANOVA, F(3, 21) = 124.4, p < 0.001; post-hoc paired t-test, all t(7) > 5.1, p < 0.001) ( ). \n   Behavioral results: Experiments 1 and 2.  \nBehavioral accuracies averaged across 14 participants in 3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, and 15\u00b0 conditions for the blocked (A) and event-related (B) designs in Experiment 1; and across 10 participants in 3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, 15\u00b0, and 80\u00b0 conditions for the blocked (C) and event-related (D) designs in Experiment 2. Error bars denote 1 SEM of the mean here and in all subsequent figures. \n  \nBehavioral results from Experiments 1 and 2 consistently showed that performance for both blocked and event-related designs significantly improved as the angular difference increased. Behavioral results from the Supplementary Experiment followed the same pattern, as shown in supporting information ( ). \n\n\n### 2.3. MRI data analysis and data quality \n  \nWe defined visual cortex ROIs in V1, V2, V3, V3a, V4, MT+, and IPS; and 42 spherical ROIs in the higher-order cortex, using the method specified in Supplemental Material 4. For the blocked design, we extracted BOLD signals by averaging the data across voxels in each pre-defined ROI, and then used a general linear model (GLM) to estimate the beta value for each ROI and each task difficulty condition. For the event-related design, we again averaged BOLD signals within each ROI, then normalized to average signal intensity and the base-line response was subtracted from the response to test stimuli. Finally, the peak of the response time course was obtained for each ROI and each condition, as a measure of activation level. In order to examine the consistency of our results between the blocked design and event-related design, we calculated the Pearson correlation between the beta values from the blocked design and the response peak magnitudes from the event-related design, across all the ROIs, participants, and difficulty conditions, separately for Experiments 1 and 2. As shown in  , the BOLD activity was similar between the blocked and event-related designs (r  = 0.68 in Experiment 1, and 0.49 in Experiment 2), demonstrating the robustness and stability of MRI data across the two experimental designs. \n   Correlation between blocked data and event-related data.  \nPearson correlation between beta values for the blocked design and response peaks for the event-related design in Experiment 1 (A) and in Experiment 2 (B) (blue: 3\u00b0, green: 9\u00b0, red: 15\u00b0, hollow yellow circle: 80\u00b0). \n  \n\n### 2.4. Difficulty of motion direction discrimination task revealed in the visual cortex with MVPA \n  \nTo account for the possibility that task difficulty is represented by a more complex code within an ROI than can be detected with univariate methods, we implemented an additional MVPA analysis on the blocked design data. Specifically, we correlated the multi-voxel activity patterns between different blocks, either of the same difficulty level or of different difficulty levels. If the neural representations of motion stimuli are changed by task difficulty, then the correlation between activity patterns in blocks of different difficulty levels (between-condition correlation) should be smaller than the correlation between activity patterns in blocks of the same difficulty level (within-condition correlation). Otherwise, if difficulty does not modulate multi-variate BOLD activity, there should be no significant difference between the within-condition correlation and between-condition correlation. This analysis was run separately on each of the seven visual ROIs described earlier, to determine which ROIs, if any, were modulated by task difficulty. The MVPA results showed that in all seven visual cortical ROIs, the within-condition correlations were significantly greater than between-condition correlations in Experiment 1 (all paired t > 4.5, p < 0.001) ( ) and in Experiment 2 (all paired t > 8.1, p < 0.001) ( ), suggesting that difficulty level is represented in the neural activity of these brain regions. \n   MVPA results.  \nThe correlation between activity patterns of motion stimuli within the same condition was larger than that between different conditions in Experiment 1 (A) and in Experiment 2 (B). \n  \n\n### 2.5. Univariate ROI analysis as a function of task difficulty \n  \nAs described in section 2.3, we obtained BOLD amplitudes at each of seven visual cortical ROIs and during each condition (difficulty level; 3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, and 15\u00b0 in Experiment 1; and 3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, 15\u00b0, and 80\u00b0 in Experiment 2), for both the blocked design (beta values estimated with a GLM) and event-related design (peak response of the time course measured as the signal percentage change). A repeated-measures ANOVA on BOLD amplitudes was performed with task difficulty as the within-participant factor in each ROI, and for both the blocked and event-related designs. In Experiment 1, the main effect of difficulty was not significant in any ROI for either design, i.e., there was no significant difference in the activation strength among three levels of task difficulty (the blocked design: all F(2, 26) < 2.7, p > 0.05,  ; the event-related design: all F(2, 26) < 0.97, p > 0.05,  ). Similarly, in Experiment 2, the main effect of difficulty was not significant in any ROI (the blocked design: all F(3, 21) < 2.2, p > 0.05,  ; the event-related design: all F(3, 21) < 2.1, p > 0.05,  ). The time courses of the BOLD signal for the event-related design are shown in Supplemental Material 3. In sum, the univariate analyses indicated that difficulty of the motion direction discrimination task did not systematically influence average cortical activations in the visual cortical areas, in either the blocked or event-related designs. \n   MRI results of ROI analysis: Experiment 1.  \nBOLD amplitudes averaged across 14 participants for the 3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, and 15\u00b0 conditions in V1, V2, V3, V3a, V4, MT+, and IPS for the blocked design (A) and the event-related design (B). \n     MRI results of ROI analysis: Experiment 2.  \nBOLD amplitudes averaged across 10 participants for the 3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, 15\u00b0, and 80\u00b0 conditions in V1, V2, V3, V3a, V4, MT+, and IPS for the blocked design (A) and the event-related design (B). \n  \nFor higher-order cortical ROIs, 42 spherical ROIs were defined based on Talairach coordinates that had been found to be modulated by task difficulty in previous literatures ( ). This same analysis was applied to all 42 ROIs for the blocked and event-related designs in Experiments 1 and 2. Again, no ROI displayed significant differences of BOLD amplitude across task difficulty conditions for either design (all p > 0.05, FDR corrected), suggesting that task difficulty did not affect activation strength in these regions either. \n   The 42 Talairach coordinates for ROI analysis in the higher-order cortex.        \n\n### 2.6. Univariate whole brain analysis as a function of task difficulty \n  \nBeyond our selected ROIs, we searched for any area in the entire brain that may show a task difficulty effect. We compared the BOLD signal at each voxel of the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) atlas brain between the different difficulty levels (3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, and 15\u00b0 in Experiment 1; 3\u00b0, 9\u00b0, 15\u00b0, and 80\u00b0 in Experiment 2), for both blocked and event-related designs. However, we did not find any voxels showing a significant difference between these conditions (p > 0.05, FDR corrected), across either experiment. \n\n\n### 2.7. Correlation between behavioral and neural responses \n  \nIn order to investigate the relationship between behavior (accuracy and response latency) and neural activity, we compared the BOLD signal during \u201ccorrect\u201d and \u201cincorrect\u201d trials, and separately correlated BOLD amplitude with behavioral response times. No significant difference in BOLD activity was found between \u201ccorrect\u201d and \u201cincorrect\u201d responses in any of the 49 ROIs (7 visual cortical ROIs and 42 higher-order cortical ROIs) (all p > 0.05, Bonferroni corrected), suggesting that these brain regions did not influence the accuracy of motion detection during the task. To evaluate the correlation between BOLD activity and behavioral response times, a Fisher-transformation was applied to the correlation coefficients to obtain z values. Only 3 out of 49 ROIs exhibited a correlation with z values being larger than 0.1 in both experiments (Experiment 1: z = 0.11 in IPS, z = 0.18 in ROI 1, z = 0.19 in ROI 7; Experiment 2: z = 0.11 in IPS, z = 0.12 in ROI 1, z = 0.17 in ROI 7). High correlations between behavioral response time and neural activity were found in IPS, ROI 1 (located at the right precuneus), and ROI 7 (located at the left anterior cingulate gyrus). \n\n\n### 2.8. Supplementary experiment results \n  \nThe behavioral and MRI results of the Supplementary Experiment, in which the stimuli were presented in the peripheral visual field, were consistent with Experiments 1 and 2 (  and   Figs). Despite the lack of statistical testing (due to the limited number of participants), the flat function of BOLD response against task difficulty in the Supplementary Experiment followed the same pattern as that in Experiments 1 and 2, in which the stimuli were presented in the foveal visual field. This serves as further support that task difficulty does not affect neural activity in the visual cortex, regardless of whether it was foveal or peripheral visual processing. \n\n\n### 2.9. Additional analyses \n  \nIn order to ensure that our null effects from the univariate analyses were not driven by particular parameters chosen in our analysis methods, we performed additional data analyses, including using spatially smoothed fMRI data, comparing 3\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 conditions directly, using fMRI data denoised by Kay et al. [ ]\u2019s method, as well as selecting the best participants\u2019 data and better ROIs to analyze. The methods and results are in Supplemental Material 5. \n\nWe replicated our findings of null effect from the entire participant group when we re-ran our analyses using only the four best participants (based on behavioral performance and imaging data quality). An additional analysis using spatially smoothed data revealed only one ROI significantly modulated by task difficulty. However, given the weak activation level at this ROI, the evidence from this particular analysis appears not very strong. The ROI analysis using denoised data revealed a significant difficulty effect (BOLD response decreased as task difficulty decreased. Figs B and C in  ) at ROI 7, located at the left anterior cingulate gyrus, for only the event-related design. Finally, we combined data from Experiments 1 and 2 and performed ROI analysis across all 24 participants. ROI 30, which was located in the basal ganglia, was found to be significantly modulated by task difficulty (BOLD response increased as task difficulty decreased.   and   Figs) in the blocked design only. These significant results occurred in one of the two designs but not consistently across both, providing only some suggestive effects of task difficulty rather than a robust conclusion. \n\nTo avoid a possibly overly conservative criterion when a large number of candidate ROIs were used, we selected the six ROIs that showed difficulty modulation in Sunaert et al. [ ]\u2019s study. The task used by Sunaert et al. [ ] was motion speed perception, which was most similar to our own task in the entire literature on brain imaging of task difficulty. Here, difficulty modulation was indeed found when data from Experiment 1 were analyzed, or when the combined data from both Experiments 1 and 2 were analyzed. Data from Experiment 2 alone did not yield statistical significance. This is suggestive evidence that task difficulty as defined in our motion direction task could modulate BOLD activation in the frontal lobe of the brain. \n\n\n\n## 3. Discussion \n  \n### 3.1. A Flat BOLD response in the visual cortex against task difficulty in the fovea and periphery \n  \nIn the current study, we investigated the effect of task difficulty (of motion direction discrimination) on BOLD activity across the entire brain. In Experiment 1, three levels of difficulty were adopted by manipulating the angular difference between the direction of a reference and a motion stimulus (RDK). Psychophysical results showed that the accuracy robustly increased as task difficulty decreased, across all participants. In contrast, our univariate fMRI results showed a flat BOLD response across task difficulty levels in seven pre-defined visual areas (V1, V2, V3, V3a, V4, MT+, and IPS), and for both event-related and blocked designs. In Experiment 2, we extended the range of task difficulty to an extremely easy level in which the angular difference in each trial was so large that little demand was required for the participants to perform this task. However, we still did not find any significant modulation of BOLD activity by difficulty level at any of the above seven visual ROIs, using the same univariate approach. In addition to the seven visual cortical areas, we also examined 42 spherical ROIs, defined manually based on previous literature. However, no significant difference in BOLD activity was found as a function of difficulty, at any of these higher-order cortical ROIs. Even when we examined the activation difference between 3\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 conditions directly, there was still no significant difference. The whole brain search similarly did not identify any voxels whose activity was significantly modulated by task difficulty. The null result was consistent across Experiments 1 and 2, and in both blocked and event-related designs. \n\nGiven the possibility that foveal visual processing might be different from peripheral visual processing, we performed a supplementary experiment, in which stimuli were presented only in the peripheral visual field, with a blank circular area in the center. Although the number of participants (four) in the Supplementary Experiment was not enough for statistical analysis, the activations in all the seven visual cortical ROIs showed the same tendency as in Experiments 1 and 2; namely, that there was no obvious difference in brain activity between the three or four task difficulty levels. These consistent activation patterns further supported the conclusion that task difficulty did not affect brain activity, regardless of the location of the visual field in which stimuli were presented. \n\n\n### 3.2. Different multi-variate patterns across difficulty conditions \n  \nIn addition to investigating the univariate BOLD activation levels at individual ROIs, as a function of task difficulty, we also explored the influence of task difficulty on neural response patterns using an MVPA method. MVPA of fMRI data is more sensitive and more informative about the functional organization of cortex than univariate analysis is with the GLM [ ]. This method revealed that the multi-voxel patterns within each of the seven visual ROIs were more correlated within-condition (i.e., blocks of the same difficulty level) than between-condition (i.e., blocks of different difficulty levels), suggesting that difficulty affected the subtle neural patterns induced by motion stimuli. Considering the failure to find difficulty-related effects using univariate methods, we can assume that task difficulty (here manipulated by the angular difference in a motion direction discrimination task) modulated neural responses by changing the patterns of activity in the visual cortex, in contrast to simpler univariate measures that indicate the extent to which a cortical field or system is globally engaged [ ]. \n\n\n### 3.3. Denoised data revealed the ACC and basal ganglia modulated by task difficulty \n  \nSome additional analyses were performed, including using spatially smoothed fMRI data and denoised data (Supplemental Material 5). However, after extensive effort to search for univariate BOLD activation modulation by task difficulty, the only brain areas we could find were the basal ganglia, which was found in previous literature to be a major structure for processing internal reward information [ \u2013 ]; and the anterior cingulate gyrus, which was found to be robustly correlated with task difficulty by a PET study across multiple tasks [ ] and an fMRI study in a paired associates learning task [ ]. Activity in the left anterior cingulate gyrus decreased as task difficulty decreased (Figs B and C in  ), suggesting that anterior cingulate gyrus activity is positively correlated with task difficulty. On the other hand, activity in the basal ganglion increased as task difficulty decreased (  and   Figs). This negative correlation may be because lower difficulty levels lead to higher behavioral accuracy, and thus higher reward, which may lead to higher neural responses in reward-related areas. These two ROIs were initially selected because they were demonstrated to be associated with task difficulty in previous literature [ , ]. Denoising the fMRI data helped reveal some suggestive effects caused by difficulty and internal rewards in higher-order cortices. Nevertheless, the findings were not robust as they were not consistent across two designs. \n\n\n### 3.4. The frontal areas with suggestive difficulty effect implied default mode network activities \n  \nA suggestive task difficulty effect was revealed in some superior and inferior frontal areas when a limited number of ROIs were selected (see Supplemental Material 5). Their negative activities during task engagement, especially for the blocked design, implied their possible involvement in the default mode network (DMN) activities. \n\n\n### 3.5. The IPS, precuneus, and ACC Activities were correlated with response times \n  \nHigh correlations between behavioral response time and neural activity in IPS, the right precuneus, and the left anterior cingulate gyrus suggest that these areas may influence the participants\u2019 ability to discriminate the stimuli, and thus would be associated with the participants\u2019 behavioral responses. This behavior-BOLD correlation is in accord with the Drift diffusion model of perceptual decision-making [ , ], which demonstrates a critical link between cognitive state and IPS activity [ , ]. The model posits that the IPS accumulates evidence from ventral temporal cortex over time and exhibits an activity level that is monotonically related to accumulation time. Although the neural activity was not correlated with task difficulty directly, it was significantly correlated with behavioral response time, found in previous literature and also supported by our results. This correlation might be due to the accumulation of activity at middle visual processing stages, instead of the task difficulty itself. On the other hand, behavioral accuracy was not significantly correlated with neural activation. Another fMRI study using modeling also demonstrated accumulator regions in the MT+, the IPS, and the inferior frontal sulcus that were modulated by task difficulty in a motion coherence task [ ]. We can assume that changes in motion direction deviation might activate similar but not completely the same accumulators activated by stimulus strength (changes in motion coherence versus stimulus contrast). \n\n\n### 3.6. Different designs elicited different results from previous studies \n  \nOur null effect of difficulty measured by univariate BOLD levels, in the visual cortex and most higher-order cortical areas found in the main analyses are in contradiction with some of the existing literature. A common assumption in previous studies was that participants might pay more attention to difficult stimuli and thus show a larger response in the visual cortex. Consistent with this assumption and introduced in the introduction, an electrophysiological study found that the response amplitude and selectivity of V4 neurons were both enhanced in difficult blocks compared to easy blocks [ ]; an fMRI study found that V1 responses decreased as the task became easier [ ]; another fMRI study discovered a significant correlation between neural activity in the frontal and parietal cortices and task difficulty in a visual tracking task [ ]; some fusiform and occipital areas also showed a significant correlation with difficulty [ ]. Note that these studies may not have independently manipulated task difficulty and attention on purpose. As a result, the effect of difficulty might be confounded with that of attention. Boudreau et al. [ ] manipulated difficulty and attention separately in a detection task and found that the increase of difficulty only caused a modest increase in the response of V4 neurons. Other fMRI studies introduced in the introduction, in which attention was controlled carefully, also demonstrated that the activity of human early visual cortex and regions in the ventral stream were not affected by difficulty [ ]; a whole brain search showed that activity in visual cortex could not be predicted by reaction times in perceptual tasks [ ]. These pieces of evidence indicate that neural activity in the visual cortex might not be affected by task difficulty when attention is controlled properly, which is consistent with our results. The task design that we adopted in the current study focused on difficulty level itself, without changing participants\u2019 attentional efforts purposely. In the event-related design experiment, participants were unable to predict the angular difference in each trial, and therefore they were probably not allocating their attention differently across different trials. If we find BOLD being modulated by task difficulty in the blocked design experiment, it might be attributed to the possibility that participants may have attended differently in anticipation of the block\u2019s difficulty and thus there is a confound. In our case, we only found suggestive modulation for the blocked design in the negatively activated frontal lobe areas, when a targeted analysis was performed in some specific ROIs. Therefore, we could assume that if there is any anticipatory attention related modulation, its effect is weak enough across the task-activated brain areas such that no statistical significance could be found; while in the frontal lobe (likely part of the DMN) with negative activations, significant modulation was found as a function of the task difficulty in the blocked design experiment. Regarding the task-activated responses we acknowledge that the lack of an effect on difficulty does not mean that the effect does not exist. It is always possible that the difficulty effect existed but was too weak for us to find in our experimental paradigm. Nevertheless, we have tried the best using different task designs and analysis methods, including checking the quality of the data. Yet the null results remained. This means that, even if the difficulty effect existed, it was too weak for our experimental paradigm to detect it. \n\n\n### 3.7. Our results contributed to better understanding on brain responses to task difficulty \n  \nIn the introduction, we presented a prior fMRI study on orientation discrimination that showed that difficulty did not affect the activity across early visual areas including V1, V2, V3, and V4 [ ]; and another study [ ] showing a similar null effect of difficulty, when external noise was added to the stimuli. Now with our study drawing a similar conclusion with these previous studies, we can put the results together for a more comprehensive overview. First, our study measured the fMRI responses to motion stimuli, while Li et al. [ ] studied orientation discrimination of gating stimuli. The task difficulty in the current study refers to the difficulty level manipulated by directional deviation in a motion direction discrimination task. Second, we investigated the responses in more brain areas than Li et al. [ ]\u2019s study. Beyond early visual areas, we examined mid-level and high-level areas such as MT+, IPS, and many spherical ROIs in higher-order cortices. Third, we measured fMRI responses in both the blocked and event-related designs. Lastly, we performed a series of systematic analyses as well as a supplementary experiment to verify the robustness of our analysis results and also investigate into the results with suggestive meanings. In summary, we believe that our results have contributed substantially to the understanding of brain responses as modulated by task difficulty. \n\n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone.0199440.t001\n### Label: Table 1\nROI\tRegion\tHemisphere\tTalairach coordinate\tTalairach coordinate.1\tTalairach coordinate.2\tReference\n\t\t\tx\ty\tz\t\n1.0\tPrecuneus\tR\t12\t-65\t51\tGould et al.

By contrast, an increase in non-dominant hand movement frequency is associated with reduced ipsilateral deactivation. This pattern suggests that inhibitory processes support right hand dominance in right-handers and raises the issues of whether this phenomenon also supports left hand preference in left-handers (LH), and/or whether it relates to asymmetry of manual ability in either group. Thanks to the BIL&GIN, a database dedicated to the investigation of hemispheric specialization (HS), we studied the variation in M1 activity during right and left finger tapping tasks (FTT) in a sample of 284 healthy participants balanced for handedness. An M1 fMRI localizer was defined for each participant as an 8 mm diameter sphere centered on the motor activation peak. RH exhibited significantly larger deactivation of the ipsilateral M1 when moving their dominant hand than their non-dominant hand. In contrast, LH exhibited comparable ipsilateral M1 deactivation during either hand movement, reflecting a bilateral cortical specialization. This pattern is likely related to left-handers\u2019 good performances with their right hand and consequent lower asymmetry in manual ability compared with RH. Finally, inter-individual analyses over the whole sample demonstrated that the larger the difference in manual skill across hands, the larger the difference in ipsilateral deactivation. Overall, we propose that difference in ipsilateral deactivation is a marker of difference in manual ability asymmetry reflecting differences in the strength of transcallosal inhibition when a given hand is moving. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAn important hypothesis regarding deactivation of the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) during hand movement has been proposed by Hayashi et al. ( ). Investigating healthy right-handers (RH) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) these authors have shown that the activity of the ipsilateral M1 during unimanual movement varies with the hand used (Hayashi et al.,  ). They demonstrated that, at low movement frequency, the contralateral M1 was moderately activated and the ipsilateral M1 was deactivated, regardless of the hand used. By contrast, increasing movement frequency was associated with a stronger ipsilateral deactivation during right-hand movement. Conversely, during left hand movement, the dominant left M1 participated in left hand motor control and became less deactivated, as this activity counters the IHI from the right M1 (Hayashi et al.,  ). In RH there have been other fMRI reports of ipsilateral deactivation during dominant (right) finger (Nirkko et al.,  ) or arm (Vidal et al.,  ) movements but not during similar movements of the non-dominant limb. According to Hayashi, this opposite pattern of deactivation in motor cortices controlling the dominant and non-dominant hands \u201cdemonstrate the dominance of the left M1 in both ipsilateral innervation and transcallosal inhibition in right-handed individuals\u201d (Hayashi et al.,  ). Actually such assertion is based not only on functional imaging observations of ipsilateral deactivation during hand or arm movement, but also on observations with paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of decrease in excitability of ipsilateral motor potential after stimulation of the contralateral M1, named the ipsilateral silent period. This inter-hemispheric inhibition (IHI) from contralateral M1 onto ipsilateral M1 is involved in the control of unilateral movements (Tazoe and Perez,  ). The anatomical support for this phenomenon is the callosal connections joining homotopic M1 areas. \n\nHowever, in order to prove that the strength of ipsilateral deactivation is related to manual dominance, one must investigate whether a similar phenomenon can be observed in left-handers (LH). LH, although less lateralized in terms of manual ability and manual preference (MP) than RH (Peters and Durding,  ; Doyen et al.,  ; Mellet et al.,  ), do exhibit MP (i.e., the behavioral expression of motor hemispheric specialization (HS)). The observation of a mirrored pattern in LH would provide strong support to the hypothesis that the larger ipsilateral deactivation of the M1 hand area when the dominant hand is moving is a marker of IHI supporting hand motor dominance. \n\nFindings regarding such a decrease in activity in the ipsilateral M1 during hand movements are missing in LH. Apart from Hayashi\u2019s ( ) study, previous functional imaging investigations in LH have looked only at activated voxels in small samples of participants (Kawashima et al.,  ; Verstynen et al.,  ; Kl\u00f6ppel et al.,  ; Grabowska et al.,  ). One paired-pulse TMS study of IHI indicates that common mechanisms may support both right and left hand preference. B\u00e4umer et al. ( ) showed larger motor evoked potential reduction (corresponding to larger IHI) when the conditioning TMS pulse was applied over the M1 of the dominant hemisphere, in both LH and RH. Note that participants in this TMS study (20 per group) were selected as having a strong MP according to the Edinburgh Score (ES; B\u00e4umer et al.,  ). However, their observation is challenged by another TMS report showing that, while increased inhibitory processing is observed in RH after the application of a TMS pulse to the left hemisphere, the mirrored situation is not observed in LH, which suggests a different organization for motor dominance (Reid and Serrien,  ). However, this last study was conducted in groups of only 8 participants, and although participants were selected as strongly lateralized, these results must be considered with caution because LH express a larger variability in their strength of MP. \n\nVery recently, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was applied to investigate whether effective connectivity during unimanual movements differs with MP (Pool et al.,  ). In this work, comparison of activation between RH and LH during unimanual tasks failed to demonstrate any difference in contralateral M1 activity for either hand and showed that variation of M1 activity with movement frequency was independent of handedness, as already reported during simple motor tasks (Solodkin et al.,  ). DCM analyses revealed stronger inter-hemispheric connectivity between supplementary motor areas (SMAs) and a stronger inhibitory influence of the ipsilateral SMA on the ipsilateral M1 during movement of the dominant hand than of the non-dominant hand in RH; this phenomenon was also stronger in RH than in LH (Pool et al.,  ). These results highlight that inhibitory modulation of ipsilateral motor cortices (rather than contralateral activations) is a likely support of manual dominance. \n\nAs a whole, these results obtained in relatively limited samples of participants do not allow definitive conclusions regarding the commonalities and/or differences in M1 variations during unimanual movement in LH and RH. To investigate these questions further, we took advantage of the BIL&GIN database , which is dedicated to the investigation of HS. The BIL&GIN contains records from a sample of 453 adult participants enriched in LH (45%,   N   = 205) as compared to the general population. For each subject, socio-demographic data, hand and eye laterality, family handedness, and cognitive abilities in the language, motor, visuo-spatial, and numerical domains have been recorded. T1-MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were also acquired, as well as resting-state functional MRI. Task-evoked functional MRI was performed in a sub-sample of 303 subjects (157 LH) using a customized functional battery of 16 cognitive tasks exploring the same three cognitive domains. Here, we studied in 284 individuals of this sub-sample the variation of activity in the right and left hand M1 during right and left self-paced finger-tapping tasks (FTT) with functional localizers detected in each individual. Participants were trained to a 2-Hz tapping frequency because this frequency is optimal for the detection of both contralateral activation and ipsilateral deactivation of the M1 hand area (Hayashi et al.,  ). As a first step, we compared the patterns of M1 activity in RH and LH, testing whether mirrored patterns of activation and/or deactivation were associated with differences of MP. As a second step, in order to establish whether these regional patterns of activity were related to HS for hand motor control, we searched for an association between MP and the activity in the ipsilateral M1 region during either hand movement, and the existence of a relationship between ipsilateral deactivation during either hand movement and participants\u2019 asymmetry regarding manual skill. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nIn accordance to French regulation, a local ethical committee approved the study; the volunteers provided informed consent and received an allowance for their participation. From the 303 participants of the BIL&GIN, 288 completed both tasks adequately and were free of movement artifacts in both tasks. Manual laterality definition was based on self-reported handedness, i.e., by asking the participants whether they considered themselves right-handed, left-handed or forced right-handed. The 15 excluded participants were 4 RH and 11 LH. We also excluded the 4 forced RH participants because of potential variation in hand motor dominance mechanisms in this case. The study sample was thus of 284 participants (age: 25 \u00b1 6 years, 140 women). \n\nAmong the 284 participants, 142 considered themselves RH (71 men), and 142 considered themselves LH (73 men). RH and LH had significantly different mean ages (RH: 26.8 \u00b1 5.9 years, LH: 24.4 \u00b1 6.0 years,   p   = 0.0006,   t  -test) and levels of education (RH: 16.1 \u00b1 2.2 years, LH: 15.1 \u00b1 2.3 years,   p   = 0.0002,   t  -test). Due to the balanced study design, there was no significant association between self-reported handedness and sex in the study sample. \n\nStrength of MP was evaluated using 9 of the 10 items of the Edinburgh inventory (EI; Oldfield,  ). The \u201cbroom\u201d item was discarded because this tool is no longer familiar to young people. \n\nWe used a finger-tapping test (FTT) to assess manual skill (Peters and Durding,  ). Each participant, while keeping his or her wrist on the table, had to hit a button with his or her index finger as many times as possible during 10 s. For each index finger, measures were repeated three times and then averaged. Manual skill asymmetry (MSA) was calculated as the right minus left tap numbers (Tap), from which an MSA index was derived through normalization for the total number of taps as:\n \n\nwhere RTap (respectively, LTap) represents the average right (respectively, left) index finger tapping score. Compared to the MSA, the MSA index takes into account potential differences in the total number of taps, what can be important when comparing groups that differ on that total number of taps. \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition and analysis \n  \n#### Anatomical MRI \n  \nMRI was performed on the same Philips Achieva 3 Tesla MR scanner for all participants. The acquisition protocol, which lasted 30 min, included a high-resolution 3D T1-weighted sequence (3D-fast field echo(FFE)-turbo field echo(TFE); TR = 20 ms; TE = 4.6 ms; flip angle = 10\u00b0; inversion time = 800 ms; TFE = 65; sense factor = 2; matrix size = 256 \u00d7 256 \u00d7 180 mm ; 1 mm  isotropic voxel size) and a T2*-weighted multi-slice FFE (TR = 3,500 ms; TE = 35 ms; flip angle = 90\u00b0; sense factor = 2; 70 axial slices; 2 mm  isotropic voxel size). \n\nEach participant\u2019s T1-weighted volume was spatially normalized using a specific cerebral tissue template built from the T1-weighted images of 80 participants (including 40 men). The template had been acquired using the same scanner and acquisition parameters (Template resolution of 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm  voxels; bounding box,   x   = \u221290 to 90 mm,   y   = \u2212126 to 91 mm,   z   = \u221272 to 109 mm), normalized into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotaxic space (Ashburner and Friston,  ). T1-weighted volumes were processed using the statistical parametric mapping version 5 (SPM5) \u201csegment\u201d procedure with default parameters allowing segmentation of gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid components for each participant. The Total Intracranial Volume (TIV) was computed as the sum of the three component tissue volumes. \n\n\n#### Functional MRI \n  \n##### Finger tapping tasks. \n  \nFinger tapping was also used to assess the asymmetry of the hand motor system. The participant held a fiber optic response pad in each hand (Current Designs Inc, Philadelphia, PA, USA). Depending on the orientation of a symbolic cue presented at the center of the screen (arrowhead \u201c>\u201d or \u201c<\u201d), the participant had to tap his right or left index finger on the response pad at 2.0 Hz as regularly as possible. Participants were instructed to perform this rhythmic FTT for as long as the visual cue (> or >) was displayed (i.e., 12 s). The FTT was alternated with a reference task where the participants had to fixate a central crosshair. Both arrowheads and crosshair covered the same 0.8\u00b0 \u00d7 0.8\u00b0 visual angle. Motor responses from all but one participant were collected from either hand using the two fiber optic response pads. Before scanning, participants were trained to perform the FTT with the help of a metronome set at a frequency of 2 Hz. \n\nThe fMRI paradigm randomly alternated six 12-s blocks of finger tapping (3 right and 3 left) with six 12-s blocks of central fixation crosshair reference task within a run that also included 4 blocks of 16-s visually guided saccadic eye movements (VGS) along with 4 blocks of 16-s reference central fixation task. Functional images were acquired with a T2*-weighted echo-planar sequence (T2*-echoplanar imaging (EPI); 72 volumes; TR = 2 s; TE = 35 ms; flip angle = 80\u00b0; 31 axial slices; 3.75 mm  isotropic voxel size) covering the same field of view as the T2*-FFE acquisition. \n\n\n##### Whole brain analysis of the activation patterns of left and right finger tapping tasks. \n  \nThis analysis was completed with an in-house pipeline including SPM5 routines.  First, T2*-EPI images were corrected for slice timing differences and motion (6 parameters: 3 translations and 3 rotations), registered to the T2*-FFE volume, and then spatially normalized combining the T2*-FFE with the T1-weighted registration matrix and the T1-weighted stereotaxic normalization matrix. Normalized T2*-EPI volumes were then spatially smoothed using a 6-mm full width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Finally, using white matter and cerebrospinal fluid fMRI time series (average time series of voxels belonging to each tissue class), the six motion parameters and the temporal linear trend were regressed out of the fMRI data. \n\nNext, three regressors were included in a general linear model. The right finger tapping task (RFTT) regressor included the 3 blocks of right hand finger tapping and their 3 reference blocks, the left finger tapping task (LFTT) regressor included the 3 blocks of the left hand finger tapping and their 3 reference blocks, the saccadic eye movement task regressor included the 4 blocks of VGS and their 4 reference blocks. Each regressor was constructed with the blocks of interest modeled by boxcar functions corresponding to paradigm timing and convolved with a standard hemodynamic response function. The multiple regression method allows obtaining estimates of activity levels for each task (RFTT, LFTT, VGS). \n\nA second-level analysis was computed to uncover activations triggered by RFTT and LFTT tasks and those shared in common applying a conjunction analysis, and to compare the task-related activation patterns of RH to those of LH (SPM5, and voxel-level statistical thresholds was set at   p   < 0.05, family-wise error-corrected). \n\n\n##### Localizers of hand motor area (M1_ROI). \n  \nFor each participant, using an inhouse software, we detected the coordinates of the peak of the cluster that had the largest significant activation in the sensorimotor hand area contralateral to the moving hand. In order to perform automatic detection of these peaks, the search was started at the coordinates of the peak obtained on the mean activation map including all participants, in each hemisphere contralateral to the movement. Then, for each participant, left and right M1_ROIs were defined as the intersection between 8 mm diameter spheres centered on the peaks detected in the sensorimotor hand area and the activation mask during contralateral movement (threshold   p   < 0.05, uncorrected). Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) mean variations within each M1_ROI were computed for each task-related contrast map and each hemisphere. As a control, we calculated the percentage of the 8 mm diameter sphere that intersected with activated area in individual contrast set at 0.05 (uncorrected threshold), the mean sphere overlap with activation was 99.96 \u00b1 0.35% in the right M1_ROI, range [97\u2013100], during LFTT and 99.87\u00b1 1.60% [76\u2013100] in the left M1_ROI during RFTT. \n\n\n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nAll statistical procedures on ROIs were conducted using the JMP11 Pro software package. \n\n#### Behavioral control \n  \nUsing repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), we checked that the actual tapping frequency during fMRI acquisition did not differ between tasks. We also searched for possible effects of age, educational level, and sex, as well as for respective interactions between the side of finger movement and sex or MP. \n\n\n#### Manual preference and asymmetry in manual ability \n  \nBecause RH and LH differ regarding manual ability lateralization (Peters and Durding,  ; Doyen et al.,  ) and strength of MP (Corey et al.,  ; Mellet et al.,  ), self-reported RH and LH in the present study were characterized for these manual lateralization items. We conducted repeated-measures ANOVA of the RTap and LTap number to search for effects of MP, sex, and Side of finger tapping and their Side \u00d7 MP and sex \u00d7 MP interactions. Sex, age and educational level were entered into the model as covariates. To complete the   post hoc   analysis regarding side effect or interaction with side, we applied an ANOVA to the difference of tap (MSA) and to the MSA index that allows taking into account differences in the total number of taps, that can differ, in particular, with sex, men producing a larger number of taps than women. \n\n\n#### Peak localization \n  \nAbsolute values of   x  ,   y  , and   z   average coordinates of the right- and left-hemisphere locations of the M1_ROI local maxima were compared in the entire sample using paired   t  -tests. Average peak coordinates were also compared between RH and LH and included TIV in the model to take into account a possible size of the brain effect. \n\n\n#### BOLD activity during RFTT and LFTT in M1_ROI \n  \nRepeated-measures ANOVAs were used to investigate the effects of MP, side of finger movement, and their interaction on BOLD variations in M1_ROIs during the RFTT and LFTT tasks. Separate ANOVAs were conducted for the respective M1_ROIs contralateral to and ipsilateral to the side of movement. In a second step, we investigated whether the amplitude of deactivation was associated with asymmetry in manual ability as assessed with the MSA index. We conducted a repeated-measures ANOVA on BOLD values within M1_ROIs ipsilateral to movement, searching for an interaction between side of movement and MSA index. Sex, age, and educational level were included as covariates. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Manual preference and ability \n  \nSample average EI scores were 93.6 \u00b1 11.3 and \u221265.6 \u00b1 38.5 for RH and LH, respectively as defined by their self-report. These scores reflect the well-known stronger lateralization of RH individuals and the typically larger variability in MP strength of LH individuals. There was no effect of sex on EI scores in either handedness group (RH:   p   = 0.27, LH:   p   = 0.97). Note that there was a significant difference regarding variance in MP strength between LH and RH; LH had a much larger variance (Welch\u2019s test, SD RH: 11.3, LH: 38.3;   p   < 0.0001). \n\nThe MSA index sample average and standard deviation were 6.28 \u00b1 4.30 for RH and \u22122.64 \u00b1 3.94 for LH. MSA distribution did not strictly follow a normal distribution in either handedness group but deviation from normality was due to some degree of leptokurtosis rather than to some skewness (Figure  ). As shown by others, (M)ANCOVA is robust to such modest normality violation, especially for large sample size (Olejnik and Algina,  ). The repeated-measures ANOVA of RTap and LTap revealed a significant side \u00d7 MP interaction (  p   < 0.0001) caused by a larger RTap minus LTap difference in RH than in LH.   Post hoc   analysis on MSA confirmed that this larger difference in RH was caused by the poor performances of RH during left hand tapping (RTap: RH: 63.5 \u00b1 9.1, LH: 59.2 \u00b1 8.2; LTap: RH: 56.0 \u00b1 7.8, LH: 62.4 \u00b1 8.4;   p   < 0.0001; Figure  ). The same repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant effect of sex (  p   < 0.0001), a significant side \u00d7 sex interaction (  p   < 10 ), and a trend toward a side \u00d7 sex \u00d7 MP interaction (  p   = 0.09). This triple interaction was significant when the MSA index (rather than the MSA) was analyzed, accounting for a larger number of taps in men, (  p   = 0.01); it also indicates that both RH and LH women were, on average, more strongly lateralized than men (MSA index: RH women: 6.82 \u00b1 3.77, LH women: \u22123.37 \u00b1 3.23, RH men: 5.72 \u00b1 4.71, LH men: \u22121.94 \u00b1 4.43). \n  \n Right-hand and left-hand manual ability and right minus left asymmetry in finger taps corresponding to Manual Skill Asymmetry (MSA) in right- and left-handers  . Left column: the distribution of the MSA in right-handers and left-handers; Right column: the graph that illustrates the significant interaction between the side of finger tapping (right in green, left in red) and manual preference regarding the number of finger taps. Note that while right-handers exhibit a highly significant difference in number of taps because of a 12% decreased performance of the non-dominant hand there is no such a large difference in left-handers, who exhibit only a 5% decrease in non-dominant hand performance. Note that the between-hand difference was significant in both groups (  p   < 0.0001), but was significantly greater among right-handers (  p   = 0.0001). Error bars represent one standard error from the mean. \n  \n\n### fMRI task execution control \n  \nMovement side, MP, and their interaction had no significant effects on the mean frequencies of finger tapping recorded during fMRI acquisition (RH: RFTT = 2.17 \u00b1 0.38 Hz, LFTT = 2.17 \u00b1 0.39 Hz, LH: RFTT = 2.24 \u00b1 0.43 Hz, LFTT = 2.26 \u00b1 0.41 Hz). There was a significant effect of sex without any interaction with task or side: men had a slightly larger frequency than women (Men mean FTT = 2.27 \u00b1 0.42 Hz, women mean FTT = 2.15 \u00b1 0.36 Hz;   p   = 0.007). Note that there was no effect of age or educational level. \n\n\n### Whole brain analysis of LFTT and RFTT activation patterns \n  \n#### Whole sample analysis \n  \nContrast maps between each hand movement and fixation clearly revealed activations contralateral to movement (Figure  , Table  ). These specific activations were present in the sensorimotor cortices and peaked at the level of the rolandic gyrus (which hosts the hand motor representation); in the most posterior part of the SMA, corresponding to the SMA proper; in the most posterior part of the insula (which hosts the supplementary sensory cortex); in the inferior and posterior parts of the lenticular nuclei; and in the posterior thalamus. There was also activation in the ipsilateral cerebellum. \n  \n Significant fMRI average activation pattern during left FTT (red), right FTT (green), and their conjunction analysis (yellow) among the 284 participants  . The top row provides the left and right hemisphere projections of activation superimposed onto a typical individual of the BIL&GIN anatomical template. The bottom rows depict corresponding axial slices (  p   < 0.05, family-wise error-corrected). \n    \n Whole brain activation maps during right and left finger tapping tasks (FTT)  . \n  \n Threshold set to p < 0.05 corrected for family-wise error (L: left; R: right; ant.: anterior; post.: posterior, Suppl. : supplementary)  . \n  \nConjunction analysis highlighted significant bilateral activations in the basal ganglia, known to be involved in motor sequence learning (Doyon et al.,  ); in the rolandic operculum extending internally towards the mid and anterior parts of the insula and posteriorly to the   planum temporale  ; in the   pars opercularis   of the inferior frontal gyri; and in the anterior part of the SMA, corresponding to the pre-SMA. Both tasks also involved the cerebellar vermis and the right middle frontal gyrus. There was little involvement of lateral premotor regions, which was not unexpected because of the self-paced nature of the tasks used in this study, as opposed to other studies in which hand movements were externally paced (Pool et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Comparison between RH and LH \n  \nDuring right-hand movement, there was no difference between the contrast maps of RH and LH. During left-hand movement, RH exhibited larger left hemisphere activations in the inferior part of the postcentral sulcus (  x   = \u221256,   y   = \u221222,   z   = 42, cluster extent = 28 voxels,   t   = 5.32) and at the junction between the superior frontal and the precentral sulci corresponding to the location of the frontal eye fields (FFE) (  x   = \u221226,   y   = \u221212,   z   = 54, cluster extent = 22 voxels,   t   = 5.31) (Beauchamp et al.,  ). By contrast, there were no areas in which LH exhibited greater activation than RH during left-hand movement. As an illustration we also provide the activation maps of left and RH separately at the level of the rolandic genu at the same threshold (  p   < 0.05, FWE voxel-level corrected, Figure  ). \n  \n Significant fMRI average activation pattern during left FTT and right FTT presented separately in right-handers and left-handers  . The left and right hemisphere activation are superimposed onto a typical individual of the BIL&GIN anatomical template. The   z   coordinate of the axial slices is provided (  p   < 0.05, family-wise error-corrected). \n  \n\n\n### Analysis of M1_ROI hand area activation \n  \n#### Locations of M1 hand area activation maxima \n  \nMean and SD of stereotaxic coordinates of individual peaks of activation for the M1_ROIs are provided in Table   and illustrated in Figure  . There was a small but significant difference in M1_ROI peak location between the two hemispheres (approximately 1 mm for each coordinate,   p   < 0.007): the right M1_ROI peak was in a more lateral, posterior, and upper position than the left M1_ROI peak. Note that neither MP, nor sex, nor TIV had any effect on the M1_ROI location coordinates in each hemisphere, or on the location of the between-hemisphere difference. \n  \n Location of M1 activation maxima  . \n  \n All coordinates are presented as mean \u00b1 SD  . \n    \n Location of participants\u2019 peaks during left FTT (pink dots) and right FTT (blue dots) superimposed onto the BIL&GIN template  . Note that peak locations are centered onto the   genu   of the rolandic sulcus, an anatomical marker of the location of the M1 hand area. \n  \n\n#### BOLD variations in M1_ROI according to movement side and manual preference \n  \nMP by movement side interaction had no significant effect on BOLD variations observed in the M1_ROIs contralateral to the moving finger (Table  ,   p   = 0.10). The trend was caused by higher but not significantly different activation values during LFTT in RH vs. LH (  p   = 0.23); there was no such difference during RFTT. \n  \n Mean BOLD values in M1 during each task in each hemisphere  . \n  \n All data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD  . \n  \nThere were significant effect of educational level on contralateral activation (  p   = 0.009), the larger the educational level, the lower the activation in both tasks. There was also an effect of age in interaction with the side of the moving hand (  p   = 0.005): with increasing age a trend towards a significant decrease in M1 activation was present only during LFTT (LFTT:   p   = 0.09, RFTT:   p   = 0.16). \n\nIn contrast, we observed that MP by movement side interaction had a significant effect (  p   = 0.0003) on BOLD variations in the M1_ROI ipsilateral to movement. From a movement side perspective,   post hoc   analysis showed that this effect was caused by greater deactivation in LH than in RH during LFTT (LH\u2013RH mean difference = \u22120.15,   p   = 0.01; Figure  ) and greater deactivation in RH than in LH during RFTT (RH\u2013LH mean difference = \u22120,14,   p   = 0.05). From an MP perspective (Figure  ), this interaction can also be described as the existence of a significant difference between ipsilateral deactivation during dominant and non-dominant hand movement in RH (mean = 0.32,   p   < 0.0001) but not in LH (mean = 0.03,   p   = 0.51). \n  \n Ipsilateral M1-ROI deactivation during finger tapping in right- and left-handers  . This graph illustrates the significant interaction observed between the side of finger tapping (right in green, left in red) and manual preference on deactivation in the ipsilateral M1_ROI (% of BOLD variation, arbitrary unit). The between-hand difference was significant in right-handers only (  p   = 0.0001) because they exhibit a highly significant difference in right and left hand movement ipsilateral deactivation because of a small deactivation during movement of the non-dominant hand, opposed to left-handers who do not display a comparable difference. Error bars represent one standard error from the mean. \n  \nNote that there were significant effects of sex and of educational level, males having higher deactivation (men \u2212 women = \u22120.21,   p   = 0.0002), and the higher the educational level the higher the deactivation (  p   = 0.006) on ipsilateral deactivation, without interaction with the side of hand movement. \n\n\n#### Ipsilateral deactivations and asymmetry in manual ability \n  \nA significant interaction between movement side and asymmetry of manual ability was observed due to opposite profiles between RFTT and LFTT ipsilateral M1_ROI deactivation with increasing MSA index (interaction:   F   = 20.1,   p   = <0.0001). \n\nWe computed the same MANOVA, but this time entering MP and the interaction between MP and MSA index. MP main effect was significant (as previously described) but there was no interaction between MP and MSA index and the interaction between difference in deactivation with hand moving and MSA index remained significant (interaction   F   = 6.14,   p   = 0.01). There was neither interaction between movement side and manual ability when the M1_ROI contralateral to the movement side was considered (  p   = 0.53). Note that there was no effect of sex, age, educational level on this interaction. \n\n Post hoc   analysis pooling right- and left-handed showed that right M1_ROI deactivation amplitude increased significantly during RFTT as rightward asymmetry of manual ability increased (  R   = 0.05,   p   = 0.0001). During LFTT, the left M1_ROI deactivation amplitude decreased as rightward asymmetry of manual ability increased, although the regression was not significant (  R   = 0.01,   p   = 0.12). These opposite behaviors led to a significant correlation between MSA index and the difference in ipsilateral deactivation between RFTT and LFTT (  R   = 0.066,   p   < 0.0001, Figure  ). \n  \n The relationship between deactivation of the M1_ROI ipsilateral to the side of movement and the manual skill asymmetry index (  n   = 284 participants)  . Because there was no interaction between handedness and manual skill asymmetry index on the strength of deactivation the data of right- and left-handers are pooled (right-handers: green dots, left-handers: red dots). Top: right finger movement; Middle: left finger movement; Bottom: difference between ipsilateral M1-ROI deactivation measured during right finger movement and ipsilateral deactivation during left finger movements. Linear regression lines are in red. \n  \n\n\n### Summary of the results \n  \nThe present results show that manual lateralization among LH and RH of the study population was characterized by larger differences in MSA in RH owing to poor performance with their non-dominant hand compared with LH, who exhibited a lesser difference in ability between their dominant and non-dominant hands. These results demonstrate that the activation intensity of the M1 hand area contralateral to the movement side is independent of which hand is moved and of MP. They also indicate that RH exhibit significantly greater deactivation of the M1 ipsilateral to the movement of their dominant hand than LH, and vice versa. Importantly, only RH exhibited significantly greater ipsilateral deactivation during their dominant hand movement compared with their non-dominant hand movement. Independently of handedness, the intensity of the ipsilateral deactivation during the right-hand movement correlated negatively with the asymmetry of manual ability; a trend towards the reverse pattern was present during LFTT, leading to significant positive correlation between asymmetry of manual ability and right-hand vs. left-hand movement difference in ipsilateral deactivations. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, the investigation of a large population balanced for handedness allowed investigators to uncover new elements regarding the neural support of hand motor dominance. The activity of participants\u2019 motor cortices during unimanual finger movements revealed the importance of ipsilateral deactivation as a marker of MP. We will first discuss methodological issues. Then, we will comment on the absence of difference in contralateral M1 activity with respect to MP, as well as on ipsilateral M1 behavior in RH and LH. \n\n### Methodological issues \n  \nIn addition to its enhanced statistical power as a large study, a major strength of the present study comes from the absence of between-group and between-hand differences in the FTT frequency measured during the fMRI acquisition. The manual lateralization profiles of the investigated groups are consistent with previous studies on manual lateralization. Like others, we observed that LH are less lateralized in terms of manual ability than RH and demonstrated that this was because of their preserved right-hand performance, in contrast to the poor left-hand abilities of RH. We also noted that women, whether right or left-handed, were slightly more lateralized than men, a phenomenon previously reported by others (Tapley and Bryden,  ). Another strength of our study is the use of an individual localizer for each hemisphere\u2019s hand motor area, thus bypassing between-participant anatomical variability. It is interesting to note the slight but significant difference in inter-hemispheric M1 location that corresponds to the global torsion of the brain, the torque, which corresponds to the protrusion of the right frontal   petalia  . Since we did not use a symmetrical template, the imprint of the torque is still present although limited to a residual of 1 mm in each direction; however, M1 hand area location did not differ between RH and LH, suggesting little difference in M1 position with respect to handedness. \n\nThe limitation of this work is that we restricted ourselves to variations in M1 activity, while DCM has shown that the strong influence of SMA on M1 varies with handedness (Pool et al.,  ). However, the present fMRI paradigm was not designed for DCM analysis because there were only 6 blocks of FTT, three for the right and three for the left hand movement, the low repetition of the block preventing a causal analysis of the BOLD signal. The focus of the present work was rather to evaluate, for the first time, the importance of ipsilateral deactivations, which have been documented in RH by Hayashi et al. ( ) while not in LH. This study takes advantage of the large population of LH in the BIL&GIN database to show how ipsilateral deactivations of M1 are related to MP. \n\n\n### Absence of variation of activation in M1 contralateral to the moving hand with manual preference \n  \nThe present results demonstrate that the amplitude of M1_ROI activation in the M1 contralateral to the movement side is independent of the movement side and MP. Whole-brain analysis revealed very few differences in activity between LH and RH during either RFTT or LFTT. In addition, these differences were not located in the hand motor representation. One possible explanation for the lack of difference with handedness could be a ceiling effect of BOLD signal. As Hayashi et al. ( ) showed, contralateral M1s show a non-linear increase of BOLD signal according to the increase of movement frequency. When the movement frequency is relatively high, BOLD signal might not be sensitive enough to capture the differences in M1 activity. However in the present study the participants mean frequency was around 2.2 Hz, not yet corresponding to activation ceiling, while, on the opposite ipsilateral deactivation reach their ceiling at this frequency (Hayashi et al.,  ). This explanation is thus not sufficient to explain the absence of difference in activation with handedness while a difference in deactivation was detected despite of possible ceiling effect. \n\nWe noticed only two small clusters that were more activated during LFTT in the left hemisphere of RH compared with LH. One of these areas was the left FEF, a region belonging to the dorsal stream of the attentional network (Petit et al.,  ). One may first consider that, independent of the MP, subjects activated this attentional network due to a higher attentional engagement during the 12 s finger-tapping sequences while they had to tap and maintain the tapping at a given and internally guided rhythm, than during the reference condition during which they had simply to fixate the central cross. The present larger left FEF activation in RH is therefore related to the differences of lateralization of the dorsal attentional network between RH and LH. We recently demonstrated that RH show larger left activation of the dorsal attentional network than LH (Petit et al.,  ). \n\nConsidering the statistical power provided by the large sample of the present study, the lack of a significant difference between tasks and between handedness is consistent with previous reports that handedness has no effect on BOLD activity of M1 contralateral to movement (Kim et al.,  ; Civardi et al.,  ; Solodkin et al.,  ; Kl\u00f6ppel et al.,  ), even when movement frequency-dependent changes (Pool et al.,  ). Conclusively, hand preference does not find an expression in the activity of the M1 contralateral to hand movement during various unilateral hand movements. \n\n\n### Ipsilateral deactivation of M1_ROI is greater in the group moving its dominant hand \n  \nLike Hayashi et al. ( ), we observed greater deactivation in homotopic ipsilateral M1 during dominant hand movement in RH. Hayashi suggested that the ipsilateral deactivation in the non-dominant M1 hand area during a dominant hand movement would be the physiological expression of the decrease in neural excitability caused by inhibitory afference through the corpus callosum. In addition to observations coming from paired-pulse TMS studies upper mentioned, such proposal is in accordance with observations of split-brain patients suffering from uncontrolled non-dominant hand behavior or having strange hand feeling during the acute phase after callosotomy (Zaidel,  ), and with the fact that such patients are no longer able to learn complex bimanual movements during the chronic phase (Zaidel and Sperry,  ). In the same vein, patients with congenital corpus callosum agenesis are reportedly incapable of motor differentiation between hands, which suggests that an inhibitory action through the corpus callosum is essential during ontogeny in order to acquire such differentiation (Dennis,  ). Also consistent with Hayashi\u2019s hypothesis is the recent report of very strong positive correlation between the strength of IHI measured by the ipsilateral silent period and the microstructure of callosal tracts connecting M1 (  r   = 0.76, Fling et al.,  ). \n\nThe present work also provides new insights regarding the relationship between ipsilateral deactivation and MP. The first is the observation of between-group differences in ipsilateral deactivation during dominant hand movement, with larger amplitude of ipsilateral reduction of M1_ROI activity in the group that is moving its dominant hand. However, the second is recognition of a handedness effect on the between-hands differences in ipsilateral M1 deactivations: in LH, the decrease of activity in the ipsilateral cortex was comparable for the movement of preferred and non-dominant hands, while in RH it was larger for the movement of the preferred hand. \n\n\n### Left-handers have a strong motor specialization of both hands \n  \nThe fact that an ipsilateral deactivation was not significantly reduced when LH moved their right hand compared with their left hand must be confronted with the fact that LH exhibit less difference in manual ability between hands than RH. Differences in manual ability between RH and LH are mainly due to the low left hand performance of RH, which might be related to smaller ipsilateral deactivation during their left hand movement than their right hand movement. In other terms, RH who do not exhibit ipsilateral deactivation when moving their left hand exhibit low performance with this hand. This is untrue for LH, who have better non-dominant hand skill than RH and exhibit comparable ipsilateral deactivation during movement of the either non-dominant or the dominant hand. One might say that while RH have a strong specialization of the left M1 during right hand movement, LH exhibit contralateral motor specialization during the movement of either hand. \n\nThese observations are in agreement with two recent paired-pulse TMS studies conducted by the same group. The first study used TMS during a bimanual task to demonstrate a larger IHI in RH than in LH after stimulation of the dominant cortex. The study also showed that LH motor cortices exhibit equal capacities, corresponding to comparable inhibitory processing, after TMS stimulation of the right or left M1 (Reid and Serrien,  ). In their second investigation of ipsilateral M1 excitability (thus during unimanual hand movement), the same authors again showed greater inhibition from the left-dominant hemisphere to the right among RH than among LH, and that LH exhibited comparable behavior regardless of which hemisphere was stimulated (Reid and Serrien,  ). As a whole, these results suggest that LH have two dominant motor cortices, which leads to lower asymmetry than RH, leading to a decreased manual lateralization. \n\n\n### Between-hand difference in ipsilateral deactivation is associated with asymmetry in manual skill \n  \nIn the present work, we also showed that the between-hand difference in ipsilateral deactivation varied linearly and negatively with the asymmetry in manual skill of the participants in the same way in RH and LH. The largest was the ipsilateral deactivation during a given hand movement, the larger was the MSA favoring the same hand. Actually, the negative linear relationship between the difference in deactivation between RFTT and LFTT and the MSA index corresponded to a negative difference in deactivation in RH with strong right hand manual asymmetry and a positive difference in LH with strong leftward asymmetry in manual ability. Considering that ipsilateral deactivation indices IHI, such correlation supports Hayashi\u2019s hypothesis that a difference in strength of IHI is associated with manual lateralization. This finding also shows that ipsilateral deactivation, indexing IHI, is a mechanism common to RH and LH, with greater ipsilateral deactivation marking the most skilled hand, and corresponding to an increase in IHI with increasing cortical specialization. The strength of this correlation was moderate (it explained 6% of the variance) but one should keep in mind that other cortical areas interact with M1 and other factors are associated with variations in hand skill such as training, aging or expertize. \n\nThe advantage of the finger tapping test, as opposed for example to the peg-board, is that it is purely motor, the given instruction being to tap as quickly as possible. However, given that asymmetries in manual ability and MP strength were both evaluated, we also investigated the association of between-hand difference in ipsilateral deactivation with ES. Although ES is more variable in LH than in RH, the correlation between the ES and between-hand difference in ipsilateral deactivation was also significant (Spearman   r   = 0.27,   p   < 0.0001), thereby demonstrating its consistency across different measures of manual lateralization. \n\nFinally, the well known increased variability in MP strength (Mellet et al.,  ) and lower asymmetry in manual ability (Peters and Durding,  ; Doyen et al.,  ) of LH, also observed in the present sample, explains the fact that, as a group, LH did not exhibit greater ipsilateral deactivation when moving their dominant left hand. Such lower lateralization of LH resulted in a main effect of MP after controlling for MSA. However, similarly to RH, LH asymmetry in manual ability was related to the difference in between-hand lateralization and possibly of strength of IHI. \n\nTo conclude, the present study shows that the difference in ipsilateral deactivation explains part of the variance in MSA in both RH and LH, thereby validating the hypothesis proposed by Hayashi et al. ( ) that ipsilateral deactivation is a marker of hand lateralization. In addition, consistent with previous paired-pulse TMS studies, the present results also showed that LH are characterized by a cortical specialization for the movement of either hand, leading to less manual asymmetry than RH, who show stronger deactivation when their dominant hand is moving. These results underline the importance of ipsilateral deactivation in the setting up of motor skill asymmetry and call for investigations of their role during motor learning. \n\n\n\n## Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nAnatomical location\tx\ty\tz\tT-value\tx.1\ty.1\tz.1\tT-value.1\nRight FTT\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPrecentral gyrus\t\u221240\t\u221220\t54\t53.3\t\t\t\t\nPost.

The current study was aimed to provide direct evidence of such rapid access to words\u2019 semantic representations and to investigate its neural sources using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and distributed source localization technique. Thirty-three neurotypical subjects underwent the MEG recording during verb generation task, which was to produce verbs related to the presented noun cues. Brain responses evoked by the noun cues were examined while manipulating the strength of association between the noun and the potential verb responses. The strong vs. weak noun-verb association led to a greater noun-related neural response at 250\u2013400 ms after cue onset, and faster verb production. The cortical sources of the differential response were localized in left temporal pole, previously implicated in semantic access, and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), thought to subserve controlled semantic retrieval. The strength of the left VLPFC\u2019s response to the nouns with strong verb associates was positively correlated to the speed of verbs production. Our findings empirically validate the theoretical expectation that in case of a strongly connected noun-verb pair, successful access to target verb representation may occur already at the stage of lexico-semantic analysis of the presented noun. Moreover, the MEG results suggest that contrary to the previous conclusion derived from fMRI studies left VLPFC supports selection of the target verb representations, even if they were retrieved from semantic memory rapidly and effortlessly. The discordance between MEG and fMRI findings in verb generation task may stem from different modes of neural activation captured by phase-locked activity in MEG and slow changes of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in fMRI. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe retrieval of an intended word from memory storage is a crucial process for speech production. An average speaker knows about 30,000 lexical entries, yet, is capable to pick out an appropriate word less than in a half a second (Levelt,  ). \n\nAccording to conventional models, such high speed of word retrieval is based on well-learned word associations, which become embedded in the structure of semantic memory through frequent co-occurrence in the experience (Ferrer i Cancho and Sol\u00e9,  ; Nelson et al.,  ). The network of the links between the stored word representations is supposed to reflect meaningful relations between the corresponding words (Collins and Quillian,  ; Collins and Loftus,  ; Anderson,  ; Steyvers and Tenenbaum,  ). The links can vary in strength depending on similarity in meaning and/or frequency of co-occurrence: the closer the relationship between words is, the stronger the link is. The key premise for many word production studies lies in that strong links enable quick and automatic retrieval of the related words (e.g., Badre and Wagner,  ; Whitney et al.,  ). Putatively, activation can spread across the strong links from one representation to another automatically, i.e., without additional effort or time delay. \n\nMost of the evidence for spreading-activation retrieval comes from word perception studies, particularly, from the studies of subliminal semantic priming. When a target word (e.g., sugar) is preceded by a masked or short-presented (<80 ms) semantically related prime word (e.g., salt), the responses to the target tend to be shorter and more accurate, in comparison with a situation when the prime is semantically unrelated (e.g., cat; for a review, see Holcomb,  ). It is generally presumed that once the prime representation has been activated, activation spreads across the links to the related nodes but does not reach the detached representations of unrelated words. Thus, when the related target is presented, its representation is already partially activated and requires less processing to reach a recognition threshold. Considering that subliminal presentation precludes strategic use of the prime as a cue for semantic retrieval, it appears that activation spreads across the network passively, in a mechanistic-like fashion (Neely,  ; Neely and Kahan,  ). \n\nThe electrophysiological studies of semantic priming show that the prime-target relation modulates neural processing of the target at 300\u2013500 ms after its presentation. The amplitude of the N400 component of the event related potential (ERP) is reduced (more positive), when the prime and the target are semantically related (for review see Kutas and Federmeier,  ). In general, the amplitude of the N400 response is regarded as reflecting the \u201cease\u201d of access to stored semantic representations: the higher the amplitude is, the more effort is required (Kutas and Federmeier,  ; Lau et al.,  ). The reduced N400 amplitudes were suggested to be associated with a facilitated access to target representation when the prime can pre-activate the target. \n\nAccording to the word production studies (e.g., free association task, noun and verb generation task, etc.), the prime word acts as a cue, which not only facilitates but also triggers a reactivation of a related word. It has been assumed that the same spreading activation mechanism provides the automatic retrieval of representations, strongly connected to the cue word (e.g., Badre and Wagner,  ; Playfoot et al.,  ). Once the cue representation has been activated in the memory, activation spreads to related nodes in accordance with the strength of the connections. The representations connected via strong links will receive stronger activation than those with weak connections and, therefore, can quickly reach the level of activation required to be chosen for production. \n\nThis assumption has been implicitly adopted by numerous fMRI word production studies that used the generation of strongly associated words as a \u201cdefault\u201d condition to examine how the production mechanism copes with effortful retrieval. Thus, in the milestone article of Thompson-Schill et al. ( ) participants were asked to name a related verb in response to the presented noun cue. Verbal responses were slower and fMRI activation was greater when nouns were associated with many verbs (e.g., the noun \u201cmap\u201d is associated with verbs like \u201ctravel\u201d, \u201cfind\u201d, \u201cdraw\u201d etc.), compared to the nouns with one dominant response option (e.g., the noun \u201capple\u201d is strongly associated with the verb \u201ceat\u201d). Specifically, greater activation of left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) was systematically observed in condition with multiple response options that put greater demand on retrieval control (Thompson-Schill et al.,  ; Barch et al.,  ; Persson et al.,  ; Snyder and Munakata,  ; Crescentini et al.,  ; Snyder et al.,  ). It has been argued that in the absence of strong univocal noun-verb association, automatic stimulus-driven access to the target word is unsuccessful, and top-down control from the prefrontal regions is required to perform effortful search in memory (e.g., Wagner et al.,  ; Badre and Wagner,  ,  ; Martin and Cheng,  ). \n\nThis interpretation omits neural mechanisms that carry out fast and effortless retrieval of the target verb. Surprisingly, neural basis of automatic access to target representation, although being a cornerstone of theoretical language modeling, is largely overlooked in the neuroimaging research. This gap in our understanding can be partially attributed to low temporal resolution of fMRI, as it is ill-suited for capturing transient neural processes associated with rapid automatic word retrieval. This limitation could be resolved by adopting magnetoencephalography (MEG), which allows brain activation tracking up to millisecond temporal precision and has reasonable spatial accuracy. \n\nHere, using MEG, our aim was to explicitly test, whether the automatic access to response\u2019s semantic representation is indeed as early process as the retrieval-through-spreading-activation hypothesis suggests. Critical prediction from this account is that the retrieval of the words strongly associated with the presented cue can occur simultaneously with the cue\u2019s semantic analysis due to the activation spreading within the semantic networks (e.g., Badre and Wagner,  ). \n\nTo test this hypothesis we utilized verb generation task, where subjects overtly named an action associated with visually presented noun. In one experimental condition, the cues consisted of nouns with one strongly associated verb; in another case, the noun cues were weakly associated with many appropriate verbs without any clearly dominant option. We expected that strong noun-verb association would modulate event-related fields (ERFs, the magnetoencephalographic equivalent of ERPs), elicited by the noun cue. If the ease of verb production affects brain response to the noun during time window associated with its semantic processing, it will be strong evidence that the automatic target word retrieval is coupled with the cue\u2019s semantic processing. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThirty-five volunteers (age range 20\u201348, mean age 26, 16 females) underwent MEG recording. All participants were native Russian-speakers, right-handed, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and reported no neurological diseases or dyslexia. One subject was subsequently excluded from the analysis due to insufficient quantity of correct responses and another one due to MEG acquisition error. The final sample comprised 33 subjects. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of The American Psychological Association\u2019s (APA) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct with written informed consent obtained from all subjects. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Moscow State University of Psychology and Education. \n\n\n### Materials \n  \nSixty-five Russian nouns strongly associated with single verb and 65 nouns without univocal noun-verb association were selected as the production cues for overt verb generation task during an independent norming study. Four-hundred and nine nouns were taken from the frequency dictionary of modern Russian language (Lyashevskaya and Sharov,  ), based on the concreteness of the word, (confirmed by the Russian National Corpus ), and its length, (between 4 and 10 letters). Fourty native Russian subjects (20\u201340 years old, 18 females), were presented with the nouns in random order and asked a question: \u201cWhat this noun does?\u201d. The task required naming an associated verb in the inflected form as if to form a short sentence (e.g., \u201csolntse\u2014svetit/sun\u2014shines\u201d). Later the verb responses were used to distinguish the nouns with one dominant verb associate from the ones with many weakly associated verbs. The association strength measure, i.e., a proportion of the participants who generated the same verb to each noun, was calculated (Martin and Cheng,  ). If the majority of the participants (from 58% to 90%) responded with the same verb to the presented noun, it was considered to have one dominant verb associate and was included into the Strong Association (SA) condition (e.g., \u201csolovey\u2014poyet/nightingale\u2014sings\u201d). If less than 23% of the norming sample agreed on the same response, the noun was assigned to the Weak Association (WA) condition (e.g., \u201cbumaga\u2014mnetsya, goryt, rvetsya/paper\u2014crumples, burns, tears\u201d). As a result, two lists of 65 nouns each were compiled for the verb generation task (see the SA and WA nouns in Supplementary Material Appendix A1). \n\nThe mean word length, form frequency and number of lexical associates were assured to be similar between both lists (Table  ). Word form frequency was taken from Lyashevskaya and Sharov ( ) frequency dictionary. A number of lexical associates were taken from Russian Associative Thesaurus (Karaulov et al.,  ). The resulting items from SA and WA categories did not differ in average word length (  F   = 0.98,   p   = 0.52), word form frequency (  F   = 1.63,   p   = 0.02 with p-level equal to 0.01) and number of lexical associates (  F   = 0.77,   p   = 0.38). \n  \nMeans (and standard deviations) for psycholinguistic parameters of the nouns from Strong and Weak Association categories. \n  \n\n### Design and Procedure \n  \nThe participants were visually presented with the noun cues divided into 14 blocks of eight nouns each and two blocks comprised of nine nouns. The blocks contained either SA or WA cues, randomized within a block. Stimuli were written in a white font on a black background and presented on a screen placed at 1.5 m in front of the participant. The size of the stimuli did not exceed 5\u00b0 of visual angle. The experiment was implemented in the Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Albany, CA, USA). \n\nEach noun was presented within two different experimental sessions. Within the control session (silent reading) the participant\u2019s task was to read words inwardly. The trials began with presentation of a white fixation cross that randomly varied in duration for 300\u2013500 ms, followed by the noun cue which remained on the screen for 1000 ms. Within the main session (verb generation) a participant was required to produce the verb associated with a presented noun by answering a question: \u201cWhat this noun does?\u201d. The instruction implied verb inflection and, if necessary, modification of the verb into a reflexive form. During the verb generation task each noun appeared on the screen for 3500 ms and was preceded by the white fixation cross presented for 300\u2013500 ms. Nouns blocks from SA and WA categories were alternated with 16 s interval (Figure  ). \n  \nSchematic description of the experimental design. The same noun cues were visually presented during silent reading and overt verb generation tasks. The nouns from Strong Association and Weak Association categories were presented within blocks of eight or nine nouns, one category per block, alternating throughout each task. During the verb generation task the cues were presented for 3500 ms with a 300\u2013500 ms interstimulus interval. During the reading task the noun cues were presented for 1000 ms. During Verb Generation task the subjects were required to verbally respond to the presented noun with an associated verb. The verbal responses were tape recorded and responses\u2019 onsets were detected by an accelerometer placed on the participant\u2019s throat. \n  \nIn course of verb generation session, participants\u2019 vocal responses were tape recorded and checked for response errors. The trials with no or semantically unrelated responses, incomprehensible verbalizations, imprecise vocalization onsets, and with pre-stimulus intervals overlapping with the vocal response to the previous stimulus were excluded from subsequent analysis. As the verb responses were to be modified in person, number and form, we considered, although semantically correct, but erroneously modified verbs (e.g., \u201ckvartyra\u2014ubirayet/apartment\u2014cleans\u201d instead \u201ckvartyra\u2014ubirayetsya/apartment\u2014is cleaned\u201d), as errors and removed them from reaction time calculations and further MEG analysis. Overall, 2.6% (\u00b13.4%) of responses in SA condition and 17.8% (\u00b18.5%) in WA were excluded. \n\nThe reaction time of the each verb production was calculated based on the measures provided by three-axis accelerometer located on the participant\u2019s throat (ADXL330 iMEMS Accelerometer, Analog Devices, Norwood, MA, USA). Speech onsets were marked using an automated algorithm (Zakharova et al.,  ), that detected increases in the accelerometer signal (  z   axis) above baseline by three standard deviations, reaching peak amplitude (2.5\u00d7 threshold) within a 3500 ms time window, and then visually inspected for false positives. The resulting reaction times and error rates were subjected to the analysis of variance (ANOVA). \n\n\n### MEG Data Acquisition \n  \nMEG data were acquired inside a magnetically shielded room (AK3b, Vacuumschmelze GmbH, Hanau, Germany), using a dc-SQUID Neuromag  Vector View system (Elekta-Neuromag, Helsinki, Finland) with 204 planar gradiometers and 102 magnetometers. Data were sampled at 1000 Hz and filtered with a band-passed 0.03\u2013333 Hz filter. The participants\u2019 head shapes were measured by a 3Space Isotrack II System (Fastrak Polhemus, Colchester, VA, USA) by digitizing three anatomical landmark points (nasion, left and right preauricular points) and additional randomly distributed points on the scalp. While recording, the position and orientation of the head were monitored by four Head Position Indicator coils. The electrooculogram was registered with two pairs of electrodes located above and below the left eye and at the outer canthi of both eyes for recording of vertical and horizontal eye movements respectively. MRI scans were acquired for 28 participants with a 1.5 T Philips Intera system and were used for reconstruction of the cortical surface using Freesurfer software . Due to the MRI acquisition error, the rest five participants\u2019 head models have failed to be obtained. \n\n\n### MEG Pre-Processing \n  \nThe raw data were subjected to the temporal signal space separation (tSSS) method (Taulu et al.,  ), embedded in MaxFilter program (Elekta Neuromag software), aimed to suppress magnetic interference coming from sources distant to the sensor array. Biological artifacts (cardiac fields, eye movements, myogenic activity), were corrected using the SSP algorithm embedded in Brainstorm software (Tadel et al.,  ). To compensate for the within-block head-movement (as measured by Head Position Indicator coils) a movement compensation procedure was applied. For sensor-space analysis, the data were converted to standard head position (  x   = 0 mm;   y   = 0 mm;   z   = 45 mm) across all blocks. \n\nData were divided into epochs of 1300 ms, from 300 ms before to 1000 ms after stimulus onset. The baseline correction was computed using the interval from the \u2212300 ms to \u221250 ms before the stimulus onset. Epochs were rejected if the peak-to-peak value over the epoch exceeds 3 \u00d7 10-10 T/m (gradiometers) and 12 \u00d7 10-10 T/m (magnetometers) channels. Average number of verb generation trials finally taken for the analysis was 63 \u00b1 2 in SA condition and 53 \u00b1 5 in WA (  t   = 11.22,   p   < 0.001). \n\n\n### MEG Data Analysis \n  \nThe analysis of verb generation data had two steps. In order to describe the general time course of brain response to the noun cue, we merged the MEG data across both conditions and compared it with the baseline activity. This was followed by a source analysis intended to characterize the spatial-temporal cortical dynamics underlying visual noun cue processing in verb generation task. The second part of the analysis was aimed to identify putative effect of noun-verb association strength on neural activity evoked by noun cue presentation, both in terms of its timing and involved brain regions. To ensure that association strength was the main factor affecting the brain responses to the nouns from SA and WA categories we checked for SA-WA differences in the silent reading task. \n\n\n### Analysis of Phase-Locked Response to a Noun Cue \n  \nThe analysis devoted to general spatio-temporal dynamics of noun cue processing was conducted using Brainstorm software (Tadel et al.,  ). Only those 28 participants whose MRI scans were obtained entered the source analysis. The individual ERFs were computed by pooling together the trials from both conditions and averaging them over a 300 ms prestimulus interval and a 1000 ms post-stimulus for each of the 306 sensors. The cortical sources of the evoked responses were modeled by a \u201cdepth-weighted\u201d linear L2-minimum norm estimation method (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen and Ilmoniemi,  ). The individual cortical surfaces were imported from FreeSurfer and tessellated with 15,000 nodes. The forward solution was calculated using overlapping spheres approach (Huang et al.,  ). The inverse solution was computed by Brainstorm built-in minimum norm estimation algorithm applied with the default settings (\u201ckernel only\u201d as the output mode, three as the signal-to-noise ratio, the source orientation constrained to perpendicular to the cortical surface, the depth weighting restricting source locations to the cortical surface and the whitening PCA). A noise covariance matrix, necessary to control noise effects on the solution (Bouhamidi and Jbilou,  ), was calculated over \u2212300 to \u221250 baseline interval (Dale et al.,  ). \n\nThe individual source maps were projected to the cortical surface of the Montreal Neurological Institute brain template (MNI-Colin27) and a grand-average was computed. Differences in source activation between participants\u2019 responses and baseline period were tested via paired   t  -tests under significance level of   p   < 0.01 (FDR-corrected with Brainstorm built-in algorithm). \n\n\n### Analysis of SA-WA Differences in the Noun-Evoked Response \n  \nThe difference in the magnitude of noun-evoked response in SA vs. WA was examined using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12: Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London ). For analysis of evoked magnetic fields the planar gradiometers data were converted to a Matlab-based, SPM format, epoched \u2212300 ms to 1000 ms around stimulus onset, and baseline corrected over \u2212300 to \u221250 prestimulus interval. The epoched data were averaged separately across each condition, using a SPM built-in robust averaging procedure (Holland and Welsch,  ). For each gradiometer pair data were combined by calculating the root-mean-square values. The resulting 3D files of space (32 \u00d7 32 pixels) and time (1500 ms) dimensions were converted to images of Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format. \n\nFor statistical analysis the topography \u00d7 time images were smoothed in space-time using a Gaussian smoothing kernel with Full Width Half Maximum of 8 mm \u00d7 8 mm \u00d7 8 ms to ensure that the images conform to the assumptions of Random Field Theory (Kilner and Friston,  ). Then, the smoothed images from SA and WA conditions were subjected to a paired   t  -test with uncorrected threshold of   p   < 0.0001. The resulting spatial-temporal clusters of significant SA-WA differences underwent the family-wise error rate (FWE) correction with cluster-level threshold of   p   < 0.05. Only the clusters that survived cluster-level correction were used to guide the subsequent analysis in the source space. \n\nSource reconstructions of evoked magnetic fields were created by the means of Multiple Sparse Priors, the Bayesian source inversion algorithm of SPM12 (Friston et al.,  ). To determine the cortical areas that contribute to the significant SA-WA differences in the brain response, we used the sensor-level spatial-temporal clusters as the mask defining the time windows of interest and a broad cortical region of interest for source-level analysis. Within the time windows of interest the individual source maps were averaged across all time points in each experimental condition separately, then overlaid with the spatial mask and subjected to between-condition paired   t  -test. Given that the source-space analysis was guided by FWE-corrected sensor-level results, the statistical threshold in the source-space was defined at   p   < 0.05 (peak-level, uncorrected). We reconstructed the time courses at the peak vertex for each target cluster. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Results \n  \nAs expected, verb generation was faster and more accurate when the noun cues had strong verb associations (  M   = 1.22 \u00b1 0.17 s, 1.76 \u00b1 2.28% errors) compared to the nouns with weakly associated verbs (  M   = 1.89 \u00b1 0.23 s, 11.76 \u00b1 5.51% errors). ANOVA revealed large and highly significant effect of association strength on error rate (  F   = 167.6,   p   < 0.0001;   \u03b7   =0.84) and reaction times (  F   = 325;   p   < 0.0001;   \u03b7   = 0.91). \n\n\n### Electrophysiological Results \n  \n#### Event-Related Response to the Visual Noun Cue in Verb Generation Task \n  \n##### Sensor-level clusters \n  \nFigure   presents a butterfly plot of overlapped evoked responses from all MEG channels averaged across both experimental conditions. The noun cue presentation elicited the evoked response with characteristic narrow peaks around 100 and 140 ms after cue onset, followed by broader components around 200 and 400 ms. Two early components (at 100 ms and 140 ms) demonstrated typical posterior scalp distributions (Figure  ) that allowed to identify them as MEG counterparts of P100 and N170 components established in visual word recognition ERP studies (e.g., Hauk and Pulverm\u00fcller,  ; Maurer et al.,  ). The response at 200\u2013300 ms corresponded to the time window of N250 component (e.g., Holcomb and Grainger,  ), and showed bilateral temporoparietal distribution. In the time-window of \u2008\u201csemantic\u201d N400 component (300\u2013450 ms; e.g., Lau et al.,  ; Kutas and Federmeier,  ), the response shifted to the temporo-frontal scalp regions. \n  \nGrand average sensor-level magnetoencephalography (MEG) evoked response to visually presented nouns in verb generation task.

The increase of the response around zero is related to the fixation cross presentation. \n  \n\n##### Source-level analysis \n  \nAs shown in Figure  , early components of the evoked response (M100) were localized to occipital cortex bilaterally. At 140 ms the response became more left-lateralized and shifted to the inferior occipitotemporal cortex, including the region of left fusiform gyrus. By 200 ms activation spread to more anterior brain regions and reached the anterior part of left temporal lobe (ATL). At 250\u2013300 ms the response engaged part of the left VLPFC (left inferior frontal gyrus, Brodmann area 47 (BA 47)), and the areas close to the left auditory cortex, in the left transverse gyrus. After 400 ms the response centered at the cortex adjacent to the left superior temporal sulcus, and also comprised of the left VLPFC and the left inferior pericentral region. By 500 ms post-stimulus the peak of response shifted to the right middle and superior temporal gyri. MNI coordinates of the activation peaks at the respective time points (significant under   p   < 0.01, FDR-corrected at the cluster level), are presented in Table  . \n  \nReconstructed temporal sequence of cortical activations for the noun-evoked response in verb generation task.

Cortical coordinates in MNI space, Brodmann areas (BA) and anatomical specifications are given to the vertices with maximal source strength at the respective time points. The activation of all the sources is significantly greater than baseline (  p   < 0.01, FDR-corrected)  . \n  \nIn our study, the spatiotemporal pattern of noun-related evoked activity was generally consistent with the current models of visual word recognition (e.g., Grainger and Holcomb,  ; Carreiras et al.,  ). These models postulated a spread of activation along the posterior-anterior axis of the brain after visual word presentation. As the written word analysis progresses to higher-level features, the response shifts from posterior sensory regions to anterior multimodal association areas. \n\n\n\n#### Effects of Noun-Verb Association Strength on Noun Cue Processing \n  \n##### Sensor-level analysis \n  \nFigure   presents the spatial-temporal clusters differentiating the responses to the noun cues with strong and weak verb associates in verb generation task. The largest and the most significant spatial-temporal cluster (cluster-level FWE correction   p   < 0.0001), was located over the anterolateral region of the left hemispheric sensor array within the time interval of 284\u2013357 ms after the noun cue onset. Other significant anterior left-hemispheric clusters emerged either earlier\u2014at 245\u2013258 ms (cluster-level FWE correction   p   < 0.002) or later at 372\u2013384 and 397\u2013418 ms (  p   < 0.05, FWE corrected) after stimulus onset. One right hemispheric cluster survived correction for multiple comparisons (  p   < 0.05, FWE corrected): it appeared at 408 ms and was located in the anterior part of the right hemispheric sensor array. Notably, for all the significant clusters the noun-evoked response was stronger to the nouns from SA category as compared to WA one. No spatial-temporal clusters demonstrating the opposite direction of the association strength effect were found. \n  \nThe differential brain response to the nouns from Strong Association (SA) and Weak Association (WA) categories: statistical parametric mapping analysis in sensor and source space.

Areas in black correspond to spatial clusters with significant sensor-level differences in ERF between the SA and WA nouns (  t  -test,   p   < 0.05, family-wise error rate (FWE)-corrected). All the clusters reflect greater response to the SA vs. WA nouns within four time windows of 245\u2013258 ms, 284\u2013357 ms, 372\u2013384 ms and 397\u2013418 ms after the cue onset, and are spatially confined to the left anterior quadrant of the sensor map. No clusters with opposite direction of the effect were found.   (B)   The reconstruction of cortical sources underlying greater ERF to the SA vs. WA nouns. Cortical sources were modeled within the time windows defined by the significant results of the sensor-level analysis. The statistical maps were threshold using a voxel-wise statistical threshold of   p   < 0.05. \n  \nDuring silent reading task the ERFs to the nouns from SA and WA categories did not differ and both contrasts produced no significant SPM clusters. Therefore, we concluded that differences found between brain responses to SA and WA nouns in verb generation task resulted from specific task demands for retrieval of an associated verb. \n\n\n##### Source-level analysis \n  \nFigure   shows the reconstructed cortical sources of significant SA-WA difference in ERFs within the response time windows specified above. Since significant effect of association strength at the gradiometer level was mostly confined to the left anterior quadrant of the sensor array, we considered cortical locations for source-space reconstruction only within left frontal lobe and ATL. \n\nThe earliest effect of association strength was observed within 245\u2013258 ms time window and was localized to the left ATL (peak level   p  -value = 0.009). Within the next time interval (284\u2013357 ms), in addition to the left ATL (  p   = 0.023), the effect comprised the left VLPFC (BA 45/47;   p   = 0.014) and the left transverse temporal gyrus (  p   = 0.024). Further on, at 372\u2013387 and 397\u2013418 ms time windows the significant SA-WA differences in the response strength to the noun cue were concentrated in the left VLPFC (BA 47;   p   = 0.008 and   p   = 0.004, respectively) and the left postcentral gyrus (  p   = 0.007 and   p   = 0.014, respectively). Table   lists the MNI coordinates of peak vertices of the cortical sources modulated by noun-verb association strength. \n  \nCortical clusters demonstrating Strong Association vs. Weak Association contrast. \n  \n Time windows of interest, anatomical specifications, MNI coordinates, Brodmann areas (BA) and   p  -values (peak-level) displayed for clusters with higher activation for nouns with strong vs. weak verb associates  . \n  \nNext, we examined whether the enhanced response to the nouns from SA category at the cortical regions specified above is beneficial for verbal production of the target verbs. We chose four cortical regions which demonstrated the most reliable effect of noun-verb association strength in each time window of interest (Table  ). For each region we reconstructed the SA activation time courses at the peak vertices for each participant (Figure  ), The resulting source intensities were averaged across the respective time intervals and subjected to correlation analysis: computation of Spearman\u2019s correlation between this brain measure and the speed of subject\u2019s verbal response in SA condition. The response strength of both regions of the left VLPFC moderately correlated with the speed of verb generation (rho = \u22120.4,   p   = 0.04 and rho = \u22120.43,   p   = 0.03, respectively). Faster verb production was associated with greater evoked response (Figure  ). Activation strength at two other regions was not related to subjects\u2019 reaction time. \n  \nBrain response elicited by the Strong Association nouns: time course and relation to the speed of verb generation.

Note, that greater cortical response to the noun cue in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) is associated with the faster verb production. \n  \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study examined neural processes underlying automatic semantic retrieval in word production. By measuring MEG from participants involved in verb generation task, we examined whether neural responses evoked by noun cues were modulated by the association strength between a cue and to-be-produced verb. \n\nOur main finding is that the strength of noun-verb association affects noun\u2019s processing already at 250\u2013400 ms after stimulus onset, i.e., at the stage of semantic M400 component of noun-evoked response or even earlier. Thus, the retrieval of target verb does not necessarily require the noun\u2019s processing to be completed but partially overlaps and interacts with its semantic analysis. This early interactive processing engages the left hemispheric regions of temporal pole and the VLPFC that are thought to be involved into semantic access, and also modulates the activity of left auditory area and the premotor cortex. Notably, the greater activation of all these regions characterizes the brain response to the nouns, which prompt fast and effortless generation of the related verbs, i.e., the nouns with one strong verb associate in comparison with those with many weakly associated verbs. Moreover, faster speed of verb production for such nouns is directly linked to the stronger activation they elicit in the regions of the left VLPFC. Prima facie, our findings contradict the well-known fMRI results that consistently show the exactly opposite effect: greater activation of the left VLPFC for more demanding retrieval of weakly associated verb (e.g., Thompson-Schill et al.,  ; Barch et al.,  ; Snyder and Munakata,  ; Crescentini et al.,  ; Snyder et al.,  ). Further in the discussion we will address the functional meaning of our findings as well as the seemingly conflicting results observed in MEG and fMRI studies of verb generation task. It will be done from the perspective of current views on the neural origin of speech-related evoked responses and their relations to automatic retrieval of written word semantics. \n\n### Recognition Process of Visually Presented Noun Cue \n  \nIn our study, the earliest response elicited by the visually presented noun cue was observed at approximately 100 ms in the bilateral occipital cortex and, presumably, was associated with early visual analysis of sub-letter features (Tarkiainen et al.,  ). At 140\u2013200 ms the response maximum shifted to the inferior posterior occipito-temporal cortex. The existing MEG and fMRI literature agrees that these region, (more specifically the left fusiform gyrus), is related to matching high-level orthographic representation with lexical information (Nobre et al.,  ; Tarkiainen et al.,  ,  ; Dehaene et al.,  ; Dehaene and Cohen,  ). \n\nFurther on, at 200 ms post-stimulus an activation spread to the ATL and was sustained there until 500 ms after the word onset (Figures  ,  ), the timing that is closely coincides with the reported in the previous MEG, ECoG and TMS literature (McCarthy et al.,  ; Halgren et al.,  ; Lau et al.,  ; Jackson et al.,  ). There is mounting evidence implicating the ATL in semantic processing as an amodal hub, which mediates and integrates between modality-specific word representations distributed over the cortex (Rogers et al.,  ; Patterson et al.,  ; Lambon Ralph et al.,  ; Lambon Ralph,  ). According to our research, the left ATL activation at 200 ms post-stimulus could reflect its engagement into the process of activation of the stored supra-modal representations of a visually presented noun. In line with this suggestion, we observed that the ATL response to visual word was immediately followed by the activation of the auditory cortex and speech-related regions of the temporal lobe (Figure  ), which could reflect re-encoding of orthographic stimuli to its phonological representation (Haist et al.,  ; Sekiguchi et al.,  ). \n\nThe response at 300\u2013500 ms, (the time window of \u201csemantic\u201d M400 component), engaged a number of spatially distributed cortical regions including the posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) with adjacent region of the superior temporal gyrus/sulcus bilaterally, and the left VLPFC (Figure  ). The region around the superior temporal sulcus is traditionally referred to as a long-term storage of semantic representations (for meta-analysis, see Binder et al.,  ), whereas, the anterior-ventral part of the left VLPFC is suggested to be involved in a top-down control of the semantic retrieval that ensures access to the semantic features relevant to the current task (e.g., Thompson-Schill et al.,  ; Wagner et al.,  ; Badre and Wagner,  ). \n\nThus, the observed neural activity underlying processing of the visually presented noun cue in the verb generation task complies with the general scheme of visual word recognition (for recent reviews, see Salmelin,  ; Dien,  ; Grainger and Holcomb,  ; Pulverm\u00fcller et al.,  ; Carreiras et al.,  ). The processing starts from low-level analysis of visual features in the occipital cortex (~100 ms), then proceeds along the ventral visual stream to more complex analysis of word visual form in the left posterior occipitotemporal cortex (~140 ms) and culminates in sustained activity in the lexico-semantic areas of the left temporal and prefrontal cortex from around 200\u2013250 ms onwards. \n\n\n### Access to Verb Representation Is Coupled with the Processing of the Noun Cue \n  \nThe nouns with strong and weak verb associates differ in the magnitude of the evoked brain response within 250\u2013400 ms time window after the presentation. The nouns with strong verb associates followed by faster and more accurate verb generation, elicited greater brain response than the nouns with weakly associated verbs. Notably, this differential brain activation to the nouns from SA category was present only in the context of verb generation task but not during the nouns\u2019 silent reading. Given that, we suggest the observed effects were caused by specific task requirements, i.e., to retrieve a verb, and not by task-irrelevant lexical variables that could potentially affect the brain responses to the SA and WA nouns. \n\nApart from lexical difference, greater attention allocation to the more complex task could be a confounding factor in the estimation of the relation between MEG event-related response to noun cue and noun-verb association strength. The generation of weakly associated verbs was more demanding, so the stimulus blocks of WA nouns could attract more attention than the blocks comprising the cues with strong prepotent responses. The attention effect on the amplitude of event-related responses is well-described in different experimental paradigms, including speech-related tasks with more attention-demanding condition provoking a relative increase of electric and magnetic evoked responses (e.g., McCarthy and Nobre,  ; Ruz and Nobre,  ) However, in our study, the evoked response was greater to the SA nouns, which were easier to respond to than WA nouns. That is why it is highly improbable that the effect of association strength on the noun-evoked response stemmed from attention demands. \n\nThus, the ease with which the target verb had been produced was the main factor influencing the processing of the noun cue. Significantly, the observed effect occurs at the time window of 250\u2013400 ms after the cue onset suggesting the access to verbs\u2019 representations is realized already at the stage of noun\u2019s lexico-semantic processing. Conceivably, strong noun-verb association allows the activation from the cue representation to spread via the strong links to the representations of related verbs. At the same time, a WA prevents this fast access to the relevant representations devolving their retrieval to the later effortful processing mechanisms. Therefore, we can assume that in SA vs. WA condition, successful re-activation of noun-verb interconnected representation resulted in a larger amount of neural ensembles. Their combined response was reflected in a higher-amplitude noun-related ERFs. \n\nOver the years, theoretical models of semantic networks have assumed that a cue leads to simultaneous activation of multiple interconnected representations (e.g., Collins and Loftus,  ; Anderson,  ). So, this automatic conjoint processing can explain fast and efficient production of the related words (e.g., Badre and Wagner,  ). To the best of our knowledge, however, the current work is the first study that provides experimental evidence of co-activation of neural representations for nouns and verbs in verb generation task. \n\nThe activation automatically spreading between semantically related representations has been suggested as one of the mechanisms contributing to prediction in language processing (e.g., Van Petten,  ; Federmeier and Kutas,  ; Hoeks et al.,  ; Indefrey,  ). Our findings prove that the cue word presented within a task-specific framework can (pre-) activate the neural representation of the strongly associated but not-encountered words based on well-learned relations in long-term memory, thus providing direct neural evidence for predictive coding theories. \n\nThe spatial-temporal pattern of differential neural responses to noun-cues strongly associated with their verbs is consistent with the putative simultaneous processing of noun-verb semantic representations. The earliest association strength effect on brain activation occurred at 250\u2013350 ms in the left ATL, which may be responsible for a highly automatic activation of amodal semantic networks generally representing the noun with all its existing semantic associates (Fujimaki et al.,  ; Lau et al.,  ). In case of verb generation, the task may bias the re-activated links toward those connected to the verb associates. At this relatively early stage of conjoint noun-verb processing, the automatically activated verbs could be strongly associated but still task inappropriate, if they do not satisfy the task requirement to name the noun\u2019s action. This may explain the absence of correlation between the magnitude of ATL activation and the speed of verb production in SA condition (Figure  ). \n\nLater on (280\u2013420 ms post-cue), the conjoint noun-verb processing engages the left VLPFC representing the most anterior part of Broca\u2019s complex (Hagoort,  ). Given the general functional role of prefrontal cortex in the selection of task appropriate representation in underdetermined situations (e.g., Desimone and Duncan,  ; Kan and Thompson-Schill,  ), the left VLPFC\u2019s involvement may be related to selective, goal-directed processing of successfully activated verb representations. The significant correlation found between the strength of the left VLPFC\u2019s response and the speed of verb generation (Figure  ) supports the idea that this region has a direct impact on the retrieval of the target word. \n\nAn alternative explanation of the VLPFC\u2019s differential response might stem from other functions attributed to Broca\u2019s complex such as phonological encoding and syllabification (e.g., Ghosh et al.,  ; Papoutsi et al.,  ; Indefrey,  ). However, both relatively early timing of the observed differential response and its localization to the anterior part of inferior frontal gyrus refutes this interpretation. According to Indefrey ( ), the phonological encoding occurs not earlier than 255 ms before the response production. In our study, the association-strength-related modulation of the left VLPFC\u2019s activity precedes the response for approximately 800 ms, thus, occurring long before the phonological encoding of the verb response is thought to begin. In spatial terms, phonological encoding has been shown to recruit posterior regions of inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44) and ventral part of BA 6, whereas association strength affected the activity within the most anterior part of inferior frontal gyrus\u2014VLPFC/BA 47, previously implicated in semantic processing (Hagoort and Indefrey,  ). \n\nAs we have mentioned above, the fMRI studies of verb generation (e.g., Thompson-Schill et al.,  ; Barch et al.,  ; Snyder and Munakata,  ; Crescentini et al.,  ; Snyder et al.,  ) showed greater activation of the left VLPFC in WA compared to SA condition\u2014the exactly opposite effect to the one reported here. We assume that the discordance between MEG/fMRI findings results from different mode of neural activation captured by changes in evoked, phase-locked response in MEG and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Considering that the BOLD signal integrates brain hemodynamic changes over several seconds, fast and short-lived neural activation contributing to MEG/EEG evoked response could be difficult to detect with fMRI (Logothetis et al.,  ; Engell et al.,  ). In turn, ERF/ERP computation averages out the contribution of all non-stimulus-locked neural activity, which has been shown to correlate with changes in BOLD signal (Kayser et al.,  ; Koch et al.,  ; Sirotin and Das,  ; Ojemann et al.,  ). The increasing evidence indicates that hemodynamic changes measured by fMRI are more compatible with non-phase-locked changes in EEG/MEG frequency power rather than with the phase-locked ERP/ERF (Engell et al.,  ; Singh,  ). \n\nThese considerations lead to a conclusion that successful fast retrieval of task-appropriate verb is accompanied by the short-lived highly coherent neuronal activation of the left VLPFC, which is reflected in enhanced MEG phase-locked ERFs. A failure of automatic retrieval may trigger the effortful search for target representation in memory that manifests in the sustained long-lasting VLPFC\u2019s activation captured by BOLD response. Thus, it is possible that the left VLPFC, contrary to common beliefs, supports selection of the target verb representations, even if they were retrieved from semantic memory rapidly and effortlessly. \n\nThe proposed shift from automatic to effortful retrieval in the left VLPFC remains highly speculative until it is not supported by the findings obtained within a single experimental design. In this study we restricted our analysis to the stimulus-locked neural response, thus highlighting \u201cautomatic\u201d processing leading to fast and easy word production. We anticipate that the delayed and prolonged process of controlled verb retrieval will be reflected in sustained changes in the magnitude of neural oscillations, rather than in ERF source strength. This assumption leads to intriguing prediction of the opposite direction of SA-WA difference in \u201cneural activation\u201d depending on whether phase-locked or non-phase-locked MEG activity is chosen as an activation measure. In the latter case, the greater strength of MEG response should accompany the effortful retrieval of the verbs weakly associated with their nouns and should correlate with intensity of BOLD response. This hypothesis can be directly tested in the future research combining analysis of MEG phase-locked and non-phase-locked activity and hemodynamic response. \n\nIn conclusion, findings of the current study suggest that access to target verb representation in verb generation task co-occurs with lexico-semantic processing of the presented noun cue. To our knowledge, our results are among the first neuroimaging evidence supporting the idea that the target word representation may be retrieved through activation rapidly spreading along the strong links connecting a cue representation with its closest neighbors in semantic network (Badre and Wagner,  ). Furthermore, the spatial-temporal pattern of brain activation implies that this seemingly automatic semantic retrieval of target verb engages the left VLPFC, which is known to be responsible for a task-relevant selection between available response alternatives. \n\n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nAYN and AOP performed the experiment.

As a result, little is known about the dynamic of spatial updating during real body motion. Here, we exploited the high temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the dynamics of cortical activation in a spatial updating task where participants had to remember their initial orientation while they were passively rotated about their vertical axis in the dark. After the rotations, the participants pointed toward their initial orientation. We contrasted the EEG signals with those recorded in a control condition in which participants had no cognitive task to perform during body rotations. We found that the amplitude of the P N  complex of the rotation-evoked potential (RotEPs) (recorded over the vertex) was significantly greater in the Updating task. The analyses of the cortical current in the source space revealed that the main significant task-related cortical activities started during the N P  interval (136\u2013303 ms after rotation onset). They were essentially localized in the temporal and frontal (supplementary motor complex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior prefrontal cortex) regions. During this time-window, the right superior posterior parietal cortex (PPC) also showed significant task-related activities. The increased activation of the PPC became bilateral over the P N  component (303\u2013470 ms after rotation onset). In this late interval, the cuneus and precuneus started to show significant task-related activities. Together, the present results are consistent with the general scheme that the first task-related cortical activities during spatial updating are related to the encoding of spatial goals and to the storing of spatial information in working memory. These activities would precede those involved in higher order processes also relevant for updating body orientation during rotations linked to the egocentric and visual representations of the environment. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe capacity to keep track of our position in the environment is paramount when moving around. This cognitive skill is generally referred to as spatial navigation. In humans, large advances on the neural bases of spatial navigation were obtained by measuring the cerebral blood flow, with fMRI scanners, of recumbent participants virtually moving in visual environments. Studies employing these techniques have revealed a consistent set of cortical activations during spatial navigation ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Increased activations were found in areas responding to visual stimuli (striate and extrastriate visual areas), and in regions not strictly involved in visual processing yet having important higher-order functions for spatial navigation. These regions include the PPC, the temporal (TC) and frontal cortices which contribute, in varying degrees, to working memory, space perception and spatial representations. \n\nThe dynamics of the neural network underlying spatial navigation uncovered by fMRI studies is largely unknown. This is notably due to the hemodynamic response time ( ) which is too slow with respect to the speed of the processes engaged during spatial navigation (e.g., <1.5 s for simple spatial updating tasks,  ;  ;  ). One can reasonably expect that the dynamics are conditioned, to some extent, by the functions of the different elements comprising the engaged network. For instance, early and sustained activation could be found in the areas which contribute to maintaining spatial information in short-term working memory [e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), see  ;  ] and to processing external spatial information, such as goal destination [e.g., anterior PFC (aPFC), see  ;  ;  ; TC, see  ;  ]. On the other hand, later activations are to be expected in regions involved in higher cognitive processes. This could be the case for the regions that contribute to the building of egocentric and allocentric frames of reference, respectively allowing individuals to either encode the environment relative to themselves (e.g., precuneus,  ) or to encode their position relative to the environment [e.g., lateral occipital cortex (LOC),  ;  ]. \n\nElectroencephalography (EEG), with its excellent temporal resolution and the possibility to increase its spatial resolution using source analyses techniques ( ;  ,  ), appears well adapted to capture the time course of spatial navigation ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Moreover, the use of EEG also enables the investigation of brain activity in moving participants, i.e., where vestibular inputs provide the brain with critical body motions information for spatial navigation ( ;  ;  ; see  , for a review). \n\n and   recently used EEG to record cortical activities of participants who had to retain the location of a peripheral target during passive whole-body motion in the dark (see  , for a review). Investigating these activities in such spatial updating task can be thought of as a valuable entry point for getting insight into the cortical implementation of spatial navigation. Performed relatively well in darkness (see  ;  , for reviews), even in extreme cases of somatosensory deafferentation ( ), such tasks involve vestibular information processing.   and   found a large alpha power decrease in electrodes overlaying the PPC during spatial updating. Interestingly, the decreased alpha power was always located in the contralateral hemisphere to the memorized target and switched hemisphere when the unseen target changed visual hemifield during body motion. Reflecting enhanced cortical excitability ( ;  ), the decrease of alpha power observed during the actual body motion provided human electrophysiological evidence that the PPC is involved in spatial updating ( ;  ;  ;  ) and in directing attention to locations or objects in the environment ( ). \n\nApart from the PPC, no other region of the spatial navigation network revealed by human fMRI investigations (see above) showed task-related neural oscillations in   and   studies. This could be due to the fact that the EEG spectral content was examined in the electrode space (scalp level) rather than in the sources space. By partially de-convolving the EEG data in a physically and anatomically meaningful way, source space analyses may indeed reveal effects that remain undetected at the scalp level with electrode space analyses ( ;  ). \n\nThe goal of the present study was twofold: to analyze the cortical network involved in spatial updating during actual whole-body motion in the dark, and to obtain insight into the dynamics of this network. We performed source analyses of the EEG activity recorded while human participants were maintaining their initial orientation in memory while being rotated in darkness. The dynamics of the early stage of spatial updating (i.e., before predominance of processes related to the use of the updated spatial representation) was assessed by computing the current amplitude over the cortical surface in three consecutive time windows. These were defined by the negative and positive deflection points of the rotation evoked potential (RotEPs) recorded over the vertex. We predicted that the first task-related activations should be observed in areas involved in the short-term spatial working memory (e.g., dlPFC;  ) and the online spatial updating processes (e.g., PPC;  ;  ;  ). Later activations should be observed in regions involved in the egocentric encoding of spatial positions (e.g., precuneus,  ). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nThe data were collected in a previous study ( ). In this study, we specifically investigated the cortical activation associated with the planning of pointing movements whose targets were defined by idiothetic information issued from body rotations in the dark. This activation was assessed from the end of the rotation to the onset of the pointing movements (i.e., movement planning process). In the present study, we investigated the dynamics of cortical activation during the actual body motion (i.e., spatial updating process). \n\n### Participants \n  \nTen healthy right-handed participants (three women, mean age: 26.6 \u00b1 2.7 years) participated in the experiment. They all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and did not report any history of neural disorders. The data of one male participant had to be discarded because of technical problems. The experiment was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (except for registration in a database) and was approved by the Laval University Biomedical Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained prior to the experiment. \n\n\n### Experimental Set-Up \n  \nThe participants were seated in a dark room with their feet resting on a footstool. They were secured to the chair with a four-point belt. The chair could be manually rotated about its vertical axis by the experimenter. The rotations were recorded with an optical encoder at 1 kHz. A circular array of LEDs fixed on the floor behind the chair indicated its initial angular position and the three targets rotations (i.e., 20\u00b0, 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 in the counterclockwise direction). A light emitted by a laser diode fixed on the back of the chair provided the experimenter with visual feedback about the chair orientation along the LEDs array. The use of different rotation amplitudes together with the variability in the actual body rotation (e.g., acceleration, amplitude) for a given rotation target amplitude increased the necessity for the participants to direct their attention on information related to self-rotation to keep track of their initial orientation. Similar set-ups have frequently been used for testing vestibular-related processes (e.g.,  ,  ;  ;  ;  ). Importantly, the choice of manual rotations reduced the possibility of electric noise contamination of the EEG recordings (see   for a discussion on this issue). \n\n\n### Experimental Tasks \n  \n#### Updating \n  \nBefore the start of each trial, participants positioned their right hand on their ipsilateral knee and gazed at a chair-fixed LED positioned \u223c1 m in front of them. They were instructed to keep fixating this LED during the whole duration of the trials. The participants received the preparation signal \u201cready\u201d 2\u20133 s before either the 20\u00b0, 30\u00b0, or 40\u00b0 floor LED lit up behind the chair to indicate, to the experimenter, the amplitude of the next rotation. Some 100 ms after the end of the rotation, a beep indicated to the participants to produce a rapid lateral arm movement to point toward their pre-rotation, initial, orientation. The signal from the chair optical encoder was used to detect online the end of the rotation which was defined as angular velocity smaller than 2.5\u00b0/s. The buzzer emitting the beep was located directly above the participants, along their longitudinal axis. This prevented the sound from providing spatial information (e.g., initial orientation). The participants were returned to the starting position after their pointing response and the next trial started following a minimum resting time of 15 s. Results related to the motor performance have been published separately ( ). Briefly, the burst of the arm muscular activities triggering the pointing movements occurred \u223c400 ms after the imperative signal (beep) and the amplitude of the movements was scaled according to the amplitude of the body rotations. These behavioral results prove that the participants attempted to remember their initial orientation while they were passively rotated. They also indicate that spatial updating was fast and attuned to the actual body rotation in space. \n\n\n#### Control \n  \nWe performed a second experimental block of trials like those performed in the Updating task, but with the only distinction that the participants did not produce arm movement when hearing the beep after the rotation offset. For these trials, the instruction was simply to keep ocular fixation on the chair-fixed LED during the rotations. This block of trials was used to normalize EEG activities recorded in the Updating task. As the dynamics of the body rotations were similar in both the Updating and Control tasks, as it will be demonstrated below, this normalization (also detailed below) allowed EEG activities that are not strictly related to spatial updating to be to canceled out (see  ). These activities might result for instance from eye movements, and from somatosensory (see  ) stimulation during body rotations. Note, however, that important activities for spatial updating could also be present in both the Updating and Control tasks. This could be the case for activities related to vestibular stimulation and to activities where attention is directed toward self-motion information. \n\nParticipants were submitted to 25 rotations for each angular target for a total of 75 trials in each task (i.e., Updating and Control). The order of rotation amplitude was pseudo-randomly selected and the presentation order of the tasks was counterbalanced across participants. \n\nOn average (Control and Updating tasks), the rotation amplitudes were 19.81 \u00b1 0.83\u00b0, 29.67 \u00b1 0.96\u00b0, and 40.53 \u00b1 0.94\u00b0 for the 20\u00b0, 30\u00b0, and 40\u00b0 rotation tasks, respectively (see  ). To verify if participants experienced similar idiothetic information between the Updating and Control tasks, we compared chair angular acceleration between both tasks. To make this test, we first normalized the time-series of angular acceleration from start (0%) to end (100%); using an angular velocity threshold of 2.5\u00b0/s to identify beginning and ending of rotation. Then, for each chair rotation amplitude (i.e., 20\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 40\u00b0), we performed a two-tailed paired   t  -test using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analyses. SPM uses random field theory to adjust for multiple comparisons. It enables comparison of continuous variables at time points other than discrete local optima ( ). This statistical approach is suited to analyzing time-series where each sample is dependent on previous data points, as for acceleration data. For each rotation amplitude, results of the statistical tests revealed that the time-series acceleration did not significantly differ between the Updating and Control tasks (all   P  s < 0.05;  ). These results suggest that if the dynamics of cortical activities differed between the Updating and Control tasks, this difference more likely would result from a difference between the cortical processes engaged within the tasks than from different idiothetic information. \n  \nChair angular rotation.

This electrode density is considered appropriate for electrophysiological source imaging ( ). Data pre-processing was performed using BrainVision Analyzer 2 (Brain Products, Gilching, Germany). The recordings were first referenced to the averaged activity of the 64 scalp electrodes. Then, data recorded by all electrodes were synchronized with respect to the onset of the rotation (i.e., when chair angular velocity > 2.5\u00b0/s), with the average amplitude of the 200-ms pre-rotation epoch serving as baseline. The signals were band-passed filtered (0.5\u201345 Hz) and independent component analyses (ICA) were used to subtract ocular artifacts (e.g., blinks, saccades) from the EEG recordings. The recordings were visually inspected and epochs still presenting artifacts were rejected. The data were separately averaged for each participant, task, target body angular rotation amplitude (i.e., 20\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 40\u00b0) and electrode. These averages were used to estimate the sources of the cortical activities. \n\nThe cortical sources were reconstructed using Brainstorm software ( , freely available at  ). We employed the minimum-norm technique to resolve the inverse problem with unconstrained dipole orientations. The forward models were computed using a boundary element method (symmetric BEM,  ) on the anatomical MRI Colin 27 brain template, a predominant volume conductor model from the Montreal Neurological Institute. We used a BEM model with three realistic layers (scalp, inner skull, and outer skull) which provides more accurate solution than a simple three concentric spheres model ( ). To enhance the spatial resolution of the brain template, we used a high number of vertices (i.e., 306,716 vertices). Such source reconstruction of EEG data has proved to be suited for investigating the activity of outer and inner cortical surfaces ( ;  ). \n\nConsistent with previous studies ( ;  ;  ), RotEPs were found over a large set of electrodes, but were largest over the Cz electrode (i.e., vertex). As shown in   (left column: averaged RotEP; right column: individual RotEP), the RotEPs were composed of successive inflection points which we refer to as P  (overall mean 47 \u00b1 12 ms), N  (136 \u00b1 12 ms), P  (303 \u00b1 35 ms), and N  (470 \u00b1 55 ms). These points served as temporal landmarks for analyzing the dynamic of the cortical activities in the source space. \n  \nData related to the rotation evoked potentials (RotEP). (Left column) Grand average RotEP traces at electrode Cz (i.e., vertex) in the Updating and Control conditions for the 20\u00b0, 30\u00b0, and 40\u00b0 body rotations. The shaded areas represent the standard deviation of the means (positive and negative, for the Updating and Control conditions, respectively). The averages were obtained after synchronizing the traces with respect to N . Overall mean peak latencies: P : 47 \u00b1 12 ms; N : 136 \u00b1 12 ms; P : 303 \u00b1 35; N : 470 \u00b1 55 ms. (Right column) Individual RotEP of all participants in the Updating and Control conditions, for the 20\u00b0, 30\u00b0, and 40\u00b0 body rotations. \n  \nFor each participant, rotation amplitude and task, we measured the latency of each RotEP\u2019s inflection point and then averaged the current computed in the source space over three successive time windows: P N , N P , and P N . Following this step, we collapsed (by averaging) the maps obtained for each amplitude of rotations to obtain a single map of current amplitude per participant and task. Following trial rejections, the averaged current maps were built using an average number of trials of 61.33 and 63.22 for the Updating and Control conditions, respectively. It should be noted that this method for estimating EEG sources is not impacted by potential effects of rotation amplitudes, task or inter-individual differences on RotEPs peak latencies. Computed in the source space, current amplitude is considered to reflect brain activation ( ,  ). The last RotEP peak considered in the Updating task (i.e., N ) occurred on average 171, 269, and 326 ms before the end of the 20\u00b0, 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 rotations. Thus, different cortical activations between the Updating and Control tasks would likely be more related to spatial updating than to the preparation of the arm motor commands in the Updating task. \n\nTo highlight those cortical regions specifically involved in spatial updating, we computed statistical maps by contrasting the current maps (i.e., each vertice) obtained in the Updating and Control tasks using   t  -tests (significance threshold   p   < 0.05, uncorrected). These analyses were performed separately for each time windows (i.e., P N : short latency, N P : mid-latency and P N : long latency) to gain insight into the spatio-temporal dynamics of the cortical activities during spatial updating. Sources were identified according to Brodmann\u2019s areas after converting MNI to Talairach coordinates with the Non-linear Yale MNI to Talairach Conversion Algorithm ( ). The Brodmann\u2019s areas definition was based on  . \n\nThe amplitude of the cortical potentials increases when they are evoked by task-relevant somatosensory ( ;  ) or visual ( ) events. In the present study, extracting the RotEPs out of the EEG recordings allowed us to determine if this effect generalized to cortical responses evoked by idiothetic information relevant for spatial updating. To this end, we compared the amplitude of the P N , N P , and P N  components between the Updating and Control tasks. We also compared between these tasks, the latency of the RotEPs, which was defined as the time elapsed between the onset of the body rotation and P . Variables related to the RotEP were submitted to separate 2 (Task: Updating, Control) by 3 (Amplitude: 20\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 40\u00b0) repeated-measures ANOVAs (significance threshold   p   < 0.05). Prior tests (Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov) confirmed the normality of all data. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Rotation-Evoked Potentials \n  \nThe ANOVA revealed a significant effect of Task on P N  component amplitude ( ). The amplitude of this first Rotation-Evoked Potentials (RotEP) component was greater in the Updating than in the Control task (8.83 \u00b1 3.18 mV vs. 7.76 \u00b1 3.14 mV,   F   = 5.66,   p   = 0.04;   = 0.44). The analyses did not reveal significant effect of rotation Amplitude (  p   = 0.38) or significant interaction of Task \u00d7 rotation Amplitude (  p   = 0.09). The experimental tasks did not have significant effect on the other RotEP components (i.e., N P :   p   = 0.56; P N :   p   = 0.09). \n  \n (A)   Mean P N  amplitudes in the Updating and Control conditions. Error bars represent the error standard of the means.   (B)   Difference between the P N  amplitudes computed in the Updating and Control conditions. Dots of the same color represent data from the same participant. \n  \nThe latency of the RotEPs (i.e., P , mean 47 \u00b1 12 ms) was not significantly different between the Updating and Control tasks (  p   = 0.64) or between the different rotation amplitudes (  p   = 0.60). The interaction Task \u00d7 rotation Amplitude was also not significant (  p   = 0.19). \n\n\n### Dynamics of Cortical Source Activity During Spatial Updating \n  \nThe statistical maps computed over the 3 RotEP components (i.e., P N , N P , and P N ) are shown in  \u2013 . In these figures, warm color shadings indicate that the current computed in the Updating task was significantly greater than in the Control task. Cold color shadings indicate the opposite pattern. The MNI coordinates of maximal significant current difference between the Updating and Control tasks and their corresponding Brodmann areas are presented in  \u2013  for P N , N P , and P N , respectively. \n  \nStatistical map (cortex only,   p   < 0.05 uncorrected) for the Updating vs. Control contrast computed during the P N  component of the RotEP.

The statistical map indicated that the cortical activity did not significantly differ between both tasks except for small areas of the left PPC and left LOC (see  ). In these areas, the activity was smaller in the Updating than in the Control task. \n\nExtensive differences in cortical current between both tasks emerged, however, in the second RotEP component (N P , between 130 and 303 ms after rotation onset). Overall, the cortical activity increased when participants tracked their initial position during the body rotations (see  ). Significant task-related activities were mainly source-localized in the frontal and temporal cortices. Specifically, the supplementary motor complex (SMC), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (dlPFC), and the right anterior prefrontal cortex all showed greater activation in the Updating than in the Control tasks. Significantly greater current in the Updating task was also found in the right TC and in both medial TC, and in a small area of the right PPC. Only sparse regions of the LOC showed greater activation in the Control task than in the Updating task. \n\nThe increased activation observed in the Updating task during the N P  interval persisted in several cortical regions during the last RotEP component (P N , between 303 and 470 ms after rotation onset). This was the case for the bilateral dlPFC, SMC, medial TC, and for the right PPC (see  ). Other regions showed significant task-related activities exclusively in this last analyzed interval of the RotEP. These regions were the right dorsal premotor areas, the left and right cuneus, the left precuneus, and the left PPC. Increased in the Updating task during N P , the activity of the right temporal lobe was no longer altered by the spatial updating processes during P N . The left LOC continued to exhibit greater activities in the Control task. \n\nIt is of note that the motor cortex contralateral to the arm used by the participants to point toward the home position after rotation did not show significant activity in any of the three analyzed intervals. This suggests that the increased activation observed in the present Updating task was more related to spatial updating than to motor preparation   per se  . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study was designed to gain insight into the dynamics of the cortical activations underpinning spatial updating during body motions. We used a protocol in which seated participants indicated their initial orientation after being passively rotated by different amplitudes in the dark. By contrasting, in successive time windows, the EEG activity recorded during body rotations from the EEG activity recorded in a baseline control task, we were able to isolate a discrete set of cortical areas involved in spatial updating processes and appraised their dynamics. \n\n### The Early Processing of Rotation-Related Cues Is Largely Independent of the Spatial Updating \n  \nAs a first salient finding, the current measured in the source space remained largely similar between the Updating and Control tasks over the first component of the RotEPs, a period spanning 47\u2013136 ms after body rotation onset. The only significant effect revealed by the statistical map during this interval was a smaller activation in the Updating task in a few vertices of the left PPC and LOC. This effect persisted at both mid- and long latencies only for the LOC. The narrowness of the regions showing this trend raises the question of the robustness of this finding. Note, however, that the LOC contributes to the allocentric coding of space ( ;  ;  ). Hence, the smaller activity observed in the LOC during the Updating task may have hampered the use of this frame of reference for encoding home position during body rotations. This could have indirectly enhanced the use of an egocentric frame of reference, which appeared more relevant in the present Updating task performed in the dark. \n\nThe absence of large task-related activation during P N  suggests that the first wave of idiothetic cue processing during the body rotations was not strictly linked to spatial updating. Yet, despite their non-specific nature, brain processes during the early phase of the rotations most certainly remained critical for spatial updating. This could be the case of the processes associated to vestibular inputs, which are the main carrier of body motion information during passive displacements in the dark ( ). \n\nThe scarcity of early task-related activation was somewhat unexpected given that overt and covert attention influences neural activities related to the early processing of sensory cues (<100 ms;  ;  ). One explanation for the lack of different cortical activations between the Updating and Control tasks may be that participants also directed their attention toward self-motion information in the latter task. This could have helped them to keep fixation on the chair-fixed LED during the rotations. \n\n\n### Evidence of Processes Related to Spatial Working Memory and Spatial Updating at Mid-Latencies \n  \nLarge significant task-related activities emerged during the second RotEP component (i.e., N P , 136\u2013303 ms after rotation onset). These activities were source-localized in a large network comprised mainly of the frontal, temporal and parietal regions. Like most task-related activities observed in the present study, the current measured in these regions were greater in the Updating than in the Control tasks. \n\nThe dlPFC and mPFC showed increased activations in the Updating task. The increased activations in these frontal areas could be associated to important executive functions for spatial processes. Their roles in maintaining spatial information in short-term working memory, and in the cognitive manipulation of information from the environment that is out of view ( ;  ) could have been relevant in the present study for keeping track of the original orientation during entire body rotations. The persistence, in the last analyzed interval, of the strong activity of the dlPFC and mPFC in the Updating task is consistent with this suggestion. \n\nOn the other hand, the task-related activations observed in the aPFC and TC at both mid- and long latencies could be linked to the online processing of home direction during rotations. This interpretation is supported both by human studies showing that the aPFC is crucial to encoding spatial information about goals ( ;  ;  ; see   for similar evidence in rodents) and by those reporting that the activities of the medial temporal lobe dynamically change according to the current Euclidean distance of the spatial goal during navigation ( ;  ;  ;  ). Together, the sustained activation observed in the prefrontal and temporal regions while participants were passively rotated could have then contributed to the maintenance of home orientation in working memory and in the encoding of its angular distance for use in the upcoming goal-directed pointing movements. \n\nWe also found significant increased activities in the Updating task in the right superior PPC during N P  which became bilateral during P N . These results were to be expected given the well-recognized importance of the superior PPC for spatial processes, including those specifically linked to the updating of spatial representations during movements ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The activity of the PPC could have contributed to estimating the angle of home position during and after body rotation ( ;  ; see   for a review), which was an important egocentric process for planning the pointing movement. \n\nThe increased activation observed in the superior PPC could also be related to the maintenance of spatial attention (see  , for a review), which is a critical cognitive process for spatial updating. It should be noted that our observation that the increased activity in the right PPC preceded the increased activity over the left PPC is consistent with studies suggesting a right-hemispheric dominance for visual processes and remapping ( ;  ;  ). \n\nThe SMC was the last region where significant task-dependent activities were observed at mid-latencies. These increased activities also lasted until the final analysis time window (i.e., P N ). The SMC comprises the supplementary motor area (SMA), the supplementary eye fields (SEF) and the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) ( ). The SEF might have played a crucial role in the Updating task. This is suggested by studies showing that lesions affecting the SEF impair the accuracy of saccades toward a memorized visual target only if the patients are rotated before triggering the saccade ( ,  ). The SEF was first considered as an oculomotor area ( ). Studies in Monkey, however, have identified a large population of SEF neurons that increase their activities during arm movements (40% of 337 neurons in  ; 42% of 106 neurons in  ). These arm-related cells provide grounds for a plausible contribution of the SEF to providing relevant spatial information in the present study for pointing, after the rotations, toward the original body orientation. \n\n\n### Long-Latency Activities During Spatial Updating Could Be Linked to Spatial Representations \n  \nBilateral increased activations were observed at long-latency (P N ) in the cuneus, which is part of the medial visual cortex. In the present study, the only available visual input was a chair-fixed LED which the participants fixated throughout the trials. Because this visual input was present in both tasks, the contrast of Updating and Control tasks most likely canceled out the neural activity evoked by the LED fixation. This possibility is well supported by the fact that the latency of the task-related activity observed in the cuneus (>300 ms) was much longer than the latency of visual-evoked potentials recorded in occipital lobe either by EEG or magnetoencephalography (<80 ms,  ;  ;  ). More likely, the late activity of the visual cortex may have resulted from non-visual top-down signals (mediated for instance by parietal or frontal regions,  ). This could have enabled the use of a visual-like representation to encode initial direction during the rotation, perhaps through visual mental imagery (see  ;  ). The fact that visual mental imagery activates the earliest visual cortex (BA 17 and 18) ( ) affords this possibility. \n\nIt is interesting to note that the task-related activities observed in the medial surface of the left PPC (i.e., precuneus) at long latencies are consistent with the use of an egocentric frame of reference for encoding home position ( ;  ;  ). Based on idiothetic and gaze direction cues ( ;  ), this frame of reference appears most relevant in the present spatial task for updating body orientation during rotations in the dark. The egocentric spatial information contained in the precuneus would serve in contexts with body displacement but not for the mere egocentric judgments of objects location in steady body conditions ( ). We noted that the increased activation of the precuneus observed in the Updating task was left lateralized. This lateralization was also found by   when using searchlight analysis to characterize neural activity in an fMRI navigation study, but not in their follow-up analyses using a more liberal threshold. Bilateral activation of the precuneus was also observed in the   fMRI study when participants indicated the position of memorized objects following self-displacements in virtual environments. Note, however, that the low temporal resolution of fMRI scanners does not allow to determine whether activations in both hemispheres occur simultaneously. The results of the present EEG study may suggest that processes related to egocentric representations may have shorter latencies in the left than in the right precuneus, especially when encoding spatial positions from the contralateral visual hemifield. \n\nDorsal motor areas of the frontal lobe were strongly activated in the last analyzed rotation interval of the Updating task. These areas have direct connections with spinal motor neurons ( ). Importantly, however, we found that the increased activations in the dorsal motor areas were circumscribed to the right hemisphere, which was ipsilateral to the pointing arm. Although a fraction of ipsilateral connections reaches the spinal level ( ), the absence of significant task-related activities in the contralateral dorsal motor areas suggests that the functions linked to their activations were more cognitive than motoric in nature. The marked activities found in the right dPMC in the Updating task is consistent with studies showing evidence of functional hemispheric differences between the left and right dPMC, with a salience for the right dPMC for spatial working memory processes ( ;  ). The dPMC could have beneficiated from inputs sent by prefrontal areas which showed task-related activities with shorter latencies (136\u2013303 ms vs. 303\u2013470 ms after rotation onset). Indeed, the dPMC, and particularly the areas with only sparse projections to motoneurons, have dense connections with the PFC ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Enhanced P N  Amplitude During Relevant Idiothetic Stimulation \n  \nThe P N  component of the RotEP, as measured here over the vertex, had a significantly greater amplitude when the participants had to update their orientation during body rotations. This finding indicates that the amplitude of the cortical potential recorded at scalp level is a reliable marker of cognitive process enhancement related to spatial updating (including processes related to attention). This task-related effect on the P N  amplitude has found little echo, however, in the cortical current measured in the source space during the same P N  interval. This could be explained by the fact that the latter variable was obtained by averaging the cortical current over the P N  interval and that N  marked the upper bound of this interval. The differential effect of the updating task on these two EEG measurements (i.e., P N  amplitude and current in the P N  interval) might suggest that the processes specifically dedicated to space updating essentially started with a latency close to that of N , measured here as 136 ms after body rotation. Computing this latency with respect to the first cortical arrival of idiothetic cues (i.e., P : 47 ms after rotation onset), probably provides a better estimate of the latency of the updating processes. Viewed from this perspective, our EEG recordings suggest that the cortical processes specifically involved in spatial updating have a latency of \u223c89 ms. \n\n reported that the amplitude of the first RotEP component increases by increasing linear acceleration of the participants. In the present study, despite the angular acceleration increased with the rotation amplitude (see  ), the amplitude of P N  did not significantly differ between the different body accelerations. Although it is difficult to compare linear and angular accelerations, one can notice that the maximal linear accelerations differed more between the different translation conditions in   study (from 1 to 7.67 times greater) than the maximal angular accelerations did between the different rotation conditions of the current study (from 1 to 1.36 times greater). Hence, the absence of effect of angular acceleration on the amplitude of the RotEP could be due to the small difference of acceleration, in the present study, between the 20\u00b0, 30\u00b0, and 40\u00b0 rotation amplitudes. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nSome limitations in the present study should be considered. Having the objective that task-related cortical activities observed in the Updating task could not merely reflect motor-related processes linked to the preparation of the pointing movements produced after body rotations, we restrained our analyses to the early spatial updating processes [i.e., <470 ms (N ) with respect to the onset of body rotation]. Cortical activities involved in spatial updating that had greater latencies could therefore not be identified. Also, because the present vestibular memory-contingent task involved goal-directed arm movements, task-related activities observed here could be, in part, specific to spatial updating in contexts of motor actions, and perhaps more specifically of goal-directed arm movements. \n\nAnother limitation concerns the statistical analyses of the cortical sources. The present experiment was designed to investigate the dynamics of the cortical activation (including from inner surfaces) during spatial updating. To enhance the spatial resolution of the brain template, we used a high number of vertices (i.e., 306,716 vertices), without correcting for multiple comparisons. Further studies could build on the present results to focus the analyses on more circumscribed regions of the cortical network shown here as being involved in spatial updating, allowing for multiple comparisons corrections. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe excellent temporal resolution of the EEG recordings combined with the enhanced spatial resolution of EEG data by sources analyses allowed us to obtain insight into the dynamics of spatial updating during body motions. Within the time window of our analyses (period spanning 47\u2013470 ms after body rotation onset), virtually all task-related cortical changes of cortical activities during spatial updating involved increased rather than decreased activations. We found that the cortical activities specifically related to spatial updating during body rotation started \u223c90 ms after the first arrival of idiothetic inputs to the cortex. The spatial updating processes were largely mediated by a fronto-temporo-posterior network and implicated more regions of the right hemisphere. Among the first cortical regions showing task-related activities were those that contribute to the encoding of spatial goals and to spatial working memory processes (e.g., aPFC, dlPFC, TC). The regions showing later task-related activities are known to be involved in the visual processing and in the egocentric representation of the environment (e.g., cuneus, precuneus). Because the spatial updating processes investigated here served as a basis for planning goal-directed arm movements, in future research, it will be interesting to contrast the present results with those obtained in tasks requiring other motor outputs (e.g., saccade, locomotion) or pure cognitive estimates of object locations during or after body displacements. It will also be necessary to determine the degree to which the right-hemispheric dominance for spatial updating revealed here persists for rightward body rotations. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Laval University Biomedical Ethics Committee.

However, only recently have social neuroscience studies begun to consider the large behavioral literature showing a strong self-positivity bias, and these studies have mostly focused on its correlates during self-related judgments and decision-making. We carried out a functional MRI (fMRI) study to ask whether the mPFC would show effects of the self-positivity bias in a paradigm that probed participants\u2019 self-concept without any requirement of explicit self-judgment. We presented social vignettes that were either self-relevant or non-self-relevant with a neutral, positive or negative outcome described in the second sentence. In previous work using event-related potentials, this paradigm has shown evidence of a self-positivity bias that influences early stages of semantically processing incoming stimuli. In the present fMRI study, we found evidence for this bias within the mPFC: an interaction between self-relevance and valence, with only positive scenarios showing a self   vs   other effect within the mPFC. We suggest that the mPFC may play a role in maintaining a positively biased self-concept and discuss the implications of these findings for the social neuroscience of the self and the role of the mPFC. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe relationship between emotion and the self-concept lies at the core of human well-being. Understanding this complex relationship is critical for understanding motivation, learning and decision-making ( ;  ;  ) in both healthy individuals and in neuropsychiatric disorders ( ;  ;  ;  ). It is therefore important that we study the cognitive and neural mechanisms by which the self-concept and self-esteem are constructed and maintained. Here we report a functional MRI (fMRI) study examining the interaction between emotional valence and self-relevance in processing within a region that is classically associated with the self: the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). \n\n### The self-positivity bias \n  \nIt is well established that people tend to view themselves in an unrealistically positive light when compared to others or objective standards. We see ourselves as having more positive (and fewer negative) traits and abilities than others, and we expect more positive outcomes for ourselves across many domains ( ;  ;  ;  ). We are able to maintain these positive self-evaluations via motivated reasoning and asymmetric treatment of positive and negative self-related information. In response to negative information about ourselves, we employ a variety of strategies such as reinterpreting outcomes, shifting standards of comparison, and attributing negative outcomes to external, situation-specific factors ( ;  ). The result is that beliefs are more likely to be updated in response to positive than negative information about ourselves ( ). \n\nThis \u2018self-positivity bias\u2019 has important real-world consequences. Positive self-views are often seen as key for self-esteem and motivation ( ;  ), and lack of a self-positivity bias is associated with mood disorders ( ;  ;  ;  ). In addition, modeling work suggests that, under many circumstances, unrealistically positive views about the self can lead to adaptive behavior ( ). On the other hand, there can be negative consequences of such positive illusions. These include a failure to adjust behavior in response to knowledge of disease risk factors and inadequate studying by students who have an unrealistic perception of their own knowledge ( ;  ). It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms underlying unrealistic self-positivity effects ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Approaches to examining the self-positivity bias in the brain \n  \nOne way in which researchers have explored the neural basis of the self-positivity bias is to examine brain activity as participants carry out the types of decision-making tasks that are typically used to show self-positivity effects. For example, in a commonly used task, participants explicitly compare themselves to an average peer on various traits. The key finding is that well over half the participants rate themselves above average on positive traits or below average on negative traits, which is of course statistically impossible ( ). In a series of fMRI studies, Beer and colleagues reported that the degree to which participants showed the self-positivity bias (e.g. rated themselves above average or claimed knowledge they did not have) was associated with activity within the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC;  ;  ;  ). However, the pattern of activation within this region, as well as its functional connectivity, differed depending on whether self-esteem is under threat ( ;  ). Beer and colleagues took this as evidence that behavioral self-positivity effects do not all reflect the same cognitive mechanisms; they can emerge either from simple heuristics and cognitive biases or motivated cognition, depending on the context ( ;  ). \n\nUnderstanding the neural underpinnings of decision-making processes associated with the self-positivity bias is important because it reveals the mechanisms underlying active self-enhancement. On the other hand, some theorists have argued that self-positivity effects in these kinds of tasks reflect more general cognitive biases and/or the desire to present oneself well, rather than reflecting the participant\u2019s true self-concept ( ;  ;  ;  ; see discussion in  ). These previous studies therefore leave open the question of whether the self-positivity bias emerges purely through processes of explicit self-related decisions, or whether it is also a basic, implicit aspect of the way we view ourselves. If the latter is the case, then the bias should also influence brain regions that are classically associated with self-processing. \n\nA large neuroimaging literature has identified a network associated with processing self-related information. Rather than employing the kinds of social comparison decision-making tasks used to study the self-positivity bias, these studies have more directly examined contrasts between self   vs   other. These include comparisons between conditions in which participants think about themselves   vs   conditions in which they think about others, or in which they are presented with self-relevant vs. other-relevant stimuli. Such contrasts reveal activity within temporal poles, the temporal-parietal junction and much of the cortical midline ( ;  ;  ). Within this network, the region most consistently associated with self-related processing is the mPFC, usually in areas dorsal to the orbitofrontal region observed in the social comparison and judgment tasks described above ( ;  ;  ;  ).  While there is debate about the precise function of this region and the extent to which it is specialized or selective for self-related processing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), its consistent activation by self-related stimuli and conditions suggests that it plays an important role in processing information about the self. It is therefore natural to ask whether self-related activity within the mPFC can be modulated by the self-positivity bias. \n\nOnly a handful of fMRI studies have manipulated both valence and self-relevance within the same paradigm, and most of these studies have manipulated self-relevance through the task, for example, by asking participants to judge whether positive or negative trait adjectives or other stimuli are self-relevant   vs   judging whether they are relevant to someone else ( ;  ;  ;  ; see also  ;  ). Because participants are more likely to judge positive stimuli as self-relevant, this confounds self-relevance with valence. \n\nAn alternative approach is to manipulate both the self-relevance and valence of the stimuli themselves to examine how the brain is modulated by the interaction between these two variables during the processing of these stimuli. This type of paradigm can therefore test whether the self-positivity bias is a relatively automatic aspect of how we process information about ourselves. \n\nIn a previous fMRI study,  ) took this general approach. Participants read short positive and negative phrases that were presented either in the third person or in the first person, e.g. \u2018his fear\u2019   vs   \u2018my fear\u2019. First person context increased the effects of valence in emotion-associated regions (e.g. amygdala). The authors also reported differences between first person and third person trials in the mPFC, but this effect did not differ according to valence. However, in contrast with our own previous work (discussed below), a previous study using event-related potentials (ERPs) with the same materials also showed no effects of the self-positivity bias ( ). One reason for this may be the limited context of the two-word noun phrases used. Perhaps more importantly, it is not clear whether phrases in first person should be regarded as truly self-relevant given that participants have a lot of experience hearing and reading sentences in first person (e.g. in conversation, on social media, in novels) without interpreting them as being about themselves. Indeed, previous behavioral work has shown that second person (\u2018you\u2019) is more likely than first person (\u2018I\u2019) to lead people to read text as self-relevant ( ;  ; see also  ;  ). \n\n\n### The present study \n  \nWe have previously developed a paradigm to probe effects of the self-positivity bias on the processing of self-relevant information in the absence of self-related judgments or decisions ( ). Participants are simply asked to read and comprehend short two-sentence vignettes. Valence is varied by whether the second sentence has a neutral, positive or negative outcome (determined by a single word). Self-relevance is varied by changing the subject of the second sentence from a person\u2019s name to \u2018you\u2019, which, as noted above, is known to lead readers to adopt a self-relevant perspective ( ;  ;  ). For example: \u2018A man knocks on   Sandra\u2019s  /  your   hotel room door.   Sandra  /  You   see(s) that he has a tray/gift/gun in his hand\u2019. This design therefore fully crosses Valence (neutral, pleasant, unpleasant) and Self-Relevance (self, other). Because this approach gives participants no indication that their self-views are being assessed, it provides a method to examine effects of the self-positivity bias in the absence of explicit self-assessment, and avoids the confounds inherent in manipulating self-relevance via a judgment task. \n\nIn a previous ERP study using this paradigm ( ), we examined the N400 component of the ERP, which is reduced to the extent that the semantic features of a word match predictions generated by the preceding context ( ). We showed that positive words elicited a smaller N400 in self-relevant (vs. other-relevant) contexts, while no effects of self-relevance were observed in neutral or negative scenarios. This shows that participants had stronger expectations for positive information in self-relevant scenarios, and that these expectations influenced the earliest stages of semantically processing an incoming word during comprehension. This study therefore provided evidence that the self-positivity bias is a relatively automatic aspect of the way we comprehend self-relevant information. \n\nIn the present fMRI study, we used this paradigm to test the hypothesis that activity in the mPFC\u2014a region that, as discussed above, has been strongly associated with self-related processing\u2014would also show effects of the self-positivity bias. We predicted this bias would manifest as a larger effect of self-relevance for the positive scenarios than the negative or neutral scenarios; i.e. the scenarios most consistent with the positively biased self-concept would show the greatest mPFC activation. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSeventeen female participants were recruited through an advertisement on a Tufts University community website ( ). Only female participants were included in order to increase power by reducing heterogeneity and increasing the effect size (exploratory analyses of our ERP data in the same paradigm and population suggested female participants showed larger main effects of the emotion manipulation). Self-reported race and ethnicity was non-Hispanic White (12), Hispanic (1), Asian (1), mixed Asian/White (2) and unreported (1). All participants were right-handed native English speakers between the ages of 18 and 23 (M\u2009=\u200920.7, SD\u2009=\u20091.3), who reported no history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. Participants were paid for their participation and provided informed consent in accordance with the procedures of the Institutional Review Board of Massachusetts General Hospital. \n  \n Examples of two-sentence scenarios in each of the six conditions.   The critical word is underlined (but did not appear underlined in the actual stimulus lists). Thirty-six scenarios were followed by comprehension questions. For example, the scenario \u2018Casper is/You are new on campus. His/Your classmates think he is/you are quite idiosyncratic/clever/dumb compared to others.\u2019 was followed by the question \u2018Did Casper/you go to this school last year?\u2019 with the correct answer being \u2018no\u2019. Participants were instructed to press a button corresponding to the index finger and middle finger for yes and no respectively before the question left the screen \n    \nValence and arousal ratings of scenarios. Scenarios were rated by online participants who did not participate in the MRI study. Valence was rated on a scale of 1 (most negative) to 7 (most positive) with 4 as neutral. Arousal was rated on a scale of 1 (least arousing) to 7 (most arousing). Means are presented with standard deviations (across scenarios) in parentheses \n  \n\n### Stimuli \n  \nStimuli were a modified version of those used in our previous ERP work ( ,  ,  ). Two hundred sixteen sets of two-sentence scenarios were developed, each with three Valence conditions (positive, neutral, and negative) and two Self-Relevance conditions (self and other) so that there were six versions for each scenario: self-positive, self-neutral, self-negative, other-positive, other-neutral and other-negative. \n\nExample scenarios are presented in  . All scenarios were written in the present tense. The first sentence (4\u201313 words long) always introduced a situation involving one or more people, only one of which was specifically named (the protagonist, 50% female), and it was always neutral in valence. To create the self conditions, the named person was changed to \u2018you\u2019 ( ;  ;  ). The second sentence (8\u201310 words) continued the scenario and was the same across all Valence conditions except for one word, which was positive, neutral or negative. This critical word was always the either the sixth word (48 scenarios) or the seventh word (168 scenarios) of the second sentence. \n\n#### Valence and arousal ratings \n  \nWe obtained valence and arousal ratings of all six conditions of the full two-sentence scenarios from online raters (mean\u2009=\u200912.9, range\u2009=\u20098\u201321 raters per scenario) from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Mean ratings are presented in  . \n\n\n\n### Procedure \n  \n#### Stimulus presentation and task \n  \nScenarios were divided into six lists with the six conditions counterbalanced across the lists. Each list included 216 sentence pairs (36 in each condition), which were broken into six blocks. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the lists. Stimuli were presented on a projector in white font centered on a black background. Each trial began with a fixation cross of variable duration (most commonly 2\u00a0s but ranging up to 20\u00a0s) to introduce jitter. Fixation timings were determined using Optseq ( ). Each sentence of the scenario was presented on the screen for 4\u00a0s. \n\nSix comprehension questions were randomly interspersed in each block and appeared for 4\u00a0s directly after the second sentence of the scenario. The purpose of these questions was simply to ensure that participants were paying attention and comprehending the scenarios (see  ). \n\n\n#### MRI Acquisition \n  \nStructural and fMRI was acquired with a 3T Siemens Trio scanner and 32-channel head coil. FMRI data were acquired over six 7\u00a0min and 38\u00a0s runs. In each run, 230 functional volumes [36 axial slices (anterior commissure-posterior commissure aligned), 3.2\u00a0mm slice thickness, 0.64\u00a0mm skip, 200\u00a0mm field of view, in-plane resolution of 3.125\u00a0mm] were acquired with a gradient echo sequence (TR\u2009=\u20092\u00a0s, TE\u2009=\u200925\u00a0ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200977\u00b0, ascending acquisition order). In addition, at the beginning and end of the scanning session, we acquired two T1-weighted high-resolution structural images (1\u00a0mm isotropic multi-echo Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo: TR\u2009=\u20092.53\u00a0s, flip angle\u2009=\u20097\u00b0, four echoes with TE\u2009=\u20091.64\u00a0ms, 3.5\u00a0ms, 5.36\u00a0ms, 7.22\u00a0ms). We used the higher quality of the two structural scans from each subject (based on visual inspection) for the subsequent analysis. \n\n\n#### MRI processing and analysis \n  \nPreprocessing, first level and second level analyses of the fMRI data were conducted in SPM8. \n\nThe first four images in each run were discarded to eliminate transient non-saturation effects. The next step was to detect spikes and interpolate these bad slices from surrounding images using the ArtRepair toolbox ( ;  ). On average 0.3% of slices (range 0 to 4.0%) were interpolated. Images were then slice-time corrected and the volumes were realigned to the first image of each run and then to each other. The functional images were aligned with the structural image by co-registering the mean functional image to the structural image. The anatomical images were segmented into gray and white matter, and the spatial normalization parameters acquired during this step were used to normalize the functional images to the International Consortium for Brain Mapping template for European brains. Finally, the images were smoothed with an 8\u00a0mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. \n\nWe modeled the data using a general linear model with the following regressors: one for fixation, one for the first sentence of each scenario, six for the second sentence of each scenario (one for each condition: Self-Positive, Self-Neutral, Self-Negative, Other-Positive, Other-Neutral and Other-Negative) and one for the comprehension questions. All regressors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. The realignment parameters for movement correction were also included in the model. \n\nTo test our a priori hypotheses concerning the mPFC, we defined a region of interest (ROI) using the anatomical definition of the mPFC in MNI space (|x|\u2009<\u200925, y\u2009>\u200915, z\u2009>\u2009\u22125) from  ) meta-analysis of self-activations in the mPFC. This ROI includes the ventromedial PFC and dorsomedial PFC, but not the OFC (see footnote 1). To test the interaction of Valence and Self-Relevance within this region, we used a within-subjects ANOVA design matrix that consisted of one regressor for each individual subject and one regressor for the Self vs. Other contrast at each level of Valence. We set an initial voxel-level threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, and we inferred significance if the peak of any voxel within the region reached a familywise error (FWE)-corrected threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 using a small volume correction ( ). We report the coordinate, z-score and   P  -value of this peak. All reported coordinates are in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. \n\nGiven the work of Beer and colleagues showing an important role for the medial OFC for self-positivity in social comparison tasks ( ;  ), we also conducted an exploratory analysis (using the same model as described above) of a second ROI, the medial OFC, defined as |x|\u2009<\u200925, y\u2009>\u200915, z\u2009<\u2009\u22125 in MNI space (i.e. all portions of the medial PFC ventral to the ROI defined above). \n\nIn addition to this ROI analysis approach, we carried out whole brain analyses, which are reported in the  . \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral data \n  \nParticipants failed to provide a response for 3.1% of comprehension questions (an average of 1.1 of the 36 questions). For the remaining trials, accuracy ranged from 81% to 100% with an average of 91%. \n\n\n### FMRI results \n  \nThe small volume analysis in the mPFC ROI revealed a significant Valence x Self-Relevance interaction (peak MNI coordinates [0, 60, 22]; peak voxel level   p  \u2009=\u20090.047 small volume corrected, z-score\u2009=\u20094.26), see  . There were no significant main effects of Valence or Self-Relevance within this region. \n  \nActivations in the mPFC ROI. A Self-Relevance x Emotion interaction was observed in the mPFC small volume correction analysis. Follow-ups showed effects of Self-Relevance for positive scenarios, but not neutral or negative scenarios. Voxels showing greater activity for self than other are highlighted in red (no regions showed the opposite effect). Effects are shown at a voxel-level significance threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 for regions where the peak reached a FWE-corrected threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.05. See   for the full list of peaks. \n  \nWe followed up the interaction by examining all pairwise contrasts with small volume correction in the mPFC ROI. In line with our predictions, follow-ups showed that self-relevant material elicited greater activation than other-relevant material for positive scenarios, but not for neutral or negative scenarios. This self-other effect within positive scenarios emerged in a cluster closely overlapping with the cluster that showed the interaction effect; the respective peaks were observed at [\u22122, 60, 22] and [0, 60, 22]) and 98% of the voxels in the interaction cluster were significant in the pairwise contrast. Effects were also seen in more dorsal areas of mPFC (see   and  ). \n  \nSelf-positive   vs   other-positive activations in the mPFC ROI \n  \nWe also examined pairwise valence contrasts within the self-relevant and other-relevant conditions. Here, the only significant activation was a cluster showing greater activity for negative than positive scenarios within the other condition (peak MNI coordinates [14, 60, 24], peak voxel level   p  \u2009=\u20090.002 small volume corrected, z-score\u2009=\u20095.14). Notably, this effect showed only partial overlap with the interaction effect; the peak was not included in the interaction cluster and only 53% of the voxels in the interaction cluster were significant in the pairwise contrast (with 69% of significant voxels from the pairwise contrast falling outside the interaction cluster). \n\nWithin the medial OFC ROI, no significant main effects or interactions emerged, all   p  s\u2009<\u20090.19. \n\nWhole brain analyses comparing each condition to baseline as well as the full ANOVA design are reported in the  . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we showed that the mPFC\u2014a region that has long been associated with the processing or representation of the self ( ;  ;  ;  )\u2014is sensitive to the self-positivity bias. Specifically, when participants read self-relevant and other-relevant social vignettes, without any requirement to make an explicit decision about self-relevance, we found an interaction between self-relevance and valence, with only the positive scenarios showing more activity to self-relevant than other-relevant scenarios. \n\n### A self-positivity bias in the mPFC \n  \nThis effect of the self-positivity bias was observed in the area of the mPFC that has been most strongly associated with self-related cognition (cf.  ). Although there is disagreement about the precise function of the mPFC and the degree to which it is specialized or specific for self-related (or social) processing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), it is consistently modulated by self-related experimental manipulations ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). We therefore interpret our findings as supporting the idea that a core aspect of self-related processing is engaged to a greater degree when information matches positive self-views. This adds to evidence of representational similarity between positive valence and the self within ventral mPFC ( ) to suggest that the self-positivity bias is a basic, implicit aspect of the way we view the world. \n\nThe present results complement the findings of previous neuroimaging studies that have focused on how the self-positivity bias emerges in explicit social comparison tasks or tasks that require some kind of potentially self-enhancing judgment. These studies have highlighted the role of the OFC in such decision-making processes (reviewed in  ;  ). In the present study, we did not find modulation of the orbitofrontal region. This, however, is not necessarily surprising, given that participants were not making any such decisions or judgments. The findings described here suggest that when participants are simply comprehending information about themselves, without making any judgments about themselves, neural effects of the self-positivity bias can manifest in a more dorsal region that is classically associated with self-processing. \n\n\n### Functional role of the mPFC in instantiating the self-positivity bias \n  \nThe pattern of effects observed in the present study is consistent with that seen in our previous ERP study using the same stimuli ( ). In that study, we also observed a significant effect of self-relevance in the positive, but not the neutral or negative scenarios. This effect was seen on the N400 component, suggesting that self-relevant scenarios generated predictions for positive information. We think that it is unlikely that the mPFC modulation observed in this fMRI study and the modulation previously observed on the N400 reflect precisely the same underlying neural activity or mechanisms. The mPFC is not generally thought to be a source of the N400, and due to their differing spatial and temporal sensitivities, ERP and fMRI often reveal different aspects of the neural response ( ).  Instead, we suggest that the mPFC modulation observed in the present study may reflect downstream processes that relate to the construction and maintenance of the self-positivity bias. \n\nBehavioral work shows that we are more likely to update our beliefs about ourselves in response to positive than negative information (reviewed by  ). This is an important way in which unrealistic self-positivity is maintained in the face of a disconfirming reality ( ). Interestingly, some previous fMRI studies examining how unrealistic optimism is maintained have linked mPFC activity specifically to belief updating in response to positive self-related information.  ) asked participants to estimate their likelihood of experiencing various adverse events before presenting the actual average probability of each event. After this task, they reassessed participants\u2019 estimates of the likelihood of each event. They replicated findings (e.g.  ) that participants were unrealistically optimistic and that they updated their beliefs less in response to unexpectedly negative information than unexpectedly positive information. In addition, they found that the same part of mPFC that showed the interaction observed in the present study was related to tracking prediction errors and belief updating specifically for unexpectedly positive (but not negative) feedback.  ) replicated these results and extended them to people with major depressive disorder (see also   for general discussion). \n\nFurther support for the idea that the mPFC may play an important role in constructing and maintaining the self-positivity bias comes from work on the neural basis of self-esteem.  ) have shown that functional connectivity between mPFC and ventral striatum is associated with state self-esteem, and structural connectivity between these regions is associated with trait self-esteem, both at the time of scanning and eight months later ( ). \n\nAlthough these possibilities are intriguing, it is important to note that the present paradigm does not allow for strong conclusions about the precise cognitive mechanisms represented by the mPFC activation we observed. Indeed, the mPFC has been implicated in many other processes. For example, it is also thought to play an important role in self-projection and counterfactual thinking ( ;  ). Thus, it is possible that the increased activity for the self-positive scenarios arose because participants were most likely to imagine themselves experiencing or acting out these scenarios. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nIt is important to mention some limitations of the current work. First, our sample size of 17 participants was relatively small. Although this is somewhat mitigated by the relatively large number of scenarios and ROI analysis approach, the results should be treated as somewhat preliminary until confirmed or extended in a high-powered study ( ). In addition, our sample was all females, mostly white, between the ages of 18 and 23, and all were students at an elite university. This means that we should be cautious about generalizing these findings. Although work on the self-positivity bias has generally not revealed significant gender differences ( ), the bias is likely to be particularly sensitive to other social and cultural differences ( ;  ;  ;  ). As we have noted previously ( ), we believe the paradigm presented her may be valuable for future research investigating such differences. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that the mPFC, a region that has long been associated with the representation and processing of self-related information, is modulated by the self-positivity bias in a paradigm that probes self-relevant comprehension, but that does not require explicit decision-making or judgments about the self. Future research should continue to explore the neural mechanisms underlying the self-positivity bias and explore the implications for a social neuroscientific understanding of the self (see also  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: TB1\n### Label: Table 1\nOther\tOther\tOther\tSelf\tSelf\tSelf\nPositive\tNeutral\tNegative\tPositive\tNeutral\tNegative\nA man knocks on Sandra\u2019s hotel room door.

There is growing evidence that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) inhibits the amygdala and therefore plays an important role in the extinction of delay fear conditioning. To our knowledge, there is no evidence on the role of the prefrontal cortex in the extinction of trace conditioning up to now. Thus, we compared brain structures involved in the extinction of human delay and trace fear conditioning in a between-subjects-design in an fMRI study. Participants were passively guided through a virtual environment during learning and extinction of conditioned fear. Two different lights served as conditioned stimuli (CS); as unconditioned stimulus (US) a mildly painful electric stimulus was delivered. In the delay conditioning group (DCG) the US was administered with offset of one light (CS+), whereas in the trace conditioning group (TCG) the US was presented 4 s after CS+ offset. Both groups showed insular and striatal activation during early extinction, but differed in their prefrontal activation. The vmPFC was mainly activated in the DCG, whereas the TCG showed activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during extinction. These results point to different extinction processes in delay and trace conditioning. VmPFC activation during extinction of delay conditioning might reflect the inhibition of the fear response. In contrast, dlPFC activation during extinction of trace conditioning may reflect modulation of working memory processes which are involved in bridging the trace interval and hold information in short term memory. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFear serves as an alert mechanism which is vital for survival, because adaptive fear reactions enable an individual to cope with survival threats by escaping or avoiding them. However, fear reactions can become maladaptive when they are no longer appropriate to the actual situation. The ability to readjust behavior is especially important in a rapidly changing environment. In anxiety disorders, this ability usually is impaired (e.g., Rauch et al.,  ; Schiller et al.,  ). The high prevalence of anxiety disorders (~14% within 12 months; BGS98 2000) has led to extensive research in the field of fear and the neural systems involved in fear learning and its extinction. \n\nFear learning in animal and human research is mainly examined on the basis of Pavlovian fear conditioning (Pavlov,  ). In this paradigm, an initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS), such as a tone or a light, is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), such as a shock. After several pairings, the CS is associated with the US and evokes a conditioned fear response (CR) on its own. In differential fear conditioning, there are two initially neutral stimuli. One of them, the CS+, is paired with the aversive US, while the other one, the CS\u2212, is not. In this case, only the CS+ elicits a CR after several pairings with the US. Based on timing aspects of the CS\u2013US pairing we have to distinguish two forms of classical fear conditioning: In delay conditioning, the US follows the CS with no temporal gap (e.g, either the US directly follows the CS or the CS and the US coterminate meaning that there is a overlap in time), while in trace conditioning there is a temporal gap, called the trace interval, between CS offset and US onset. In the latter case, a \u201cmemory trace\u201d is necessary to learn the association between the CS and the US (Pavlov,  ). \n\nThis small difference in timing was found to be associated with differences in the neural structures underlying the acquisition of fear. The most prominent structure reported to be crucial for fear learning is the amygdala. Information about the CS and the US is transmitted from sensory cortices via the thalamus to the amygdala, which controls the expression of the fear reaction via projections to the brainstem (e.g., LeDoux,  ). Other areas found to be involved in fear acquisition in delay conditioning are the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the insular cortex. Activation in the ACC has been linked to the anticipation of pain. For example, B\u00fcchel et al. ( ) assumed that the ACC, together with activation of the anterior insula, might integrate nociceptive input with memory and therefore allows for appropriate responses to subsequent stimuli, as has been shown in pain studies (e.g., Coghill et al.,  ). The insula has been reported to be involved in conveying a cortical representation of fear to the amygdala (Phelps et al.,  ). Knight et al. ( ) and Milad et al. ( ) proposed that the ACC is involved in the expression of the fear response. It has often been reported that the hippocampus is involved in fear conditioning. The current opinion is, that contextual information, which can be of spatial or temporal nature, is represented in the hippocampus (O'Keefe and Dostrovsky,  ). Hippocampal activation has been shown to be crucial for trace conditioning since the trace interval requires the formation of a temporal context. This has been found both in fear conditioning (B\u00fcchel et al.,  ; Knight et al.,  ) as well as in eyeblink conditioning (Cheng et al.,  ). Also, Clark et al. ( ) reported that trace eyeblink conditioning additionally depends on the hippocampus and the neocortex, whereas for delay eyeblink conditioning activations of the cerebellum and the brainstem are sufficient. Human delay fear conditioning has been reported to occur without explicit hippocampal activity, too (see e.g., LaBar et al.,  ; Phelps et al.,  ; Schiller et al.,  ). Taken together, we conclude that the main neural structures involved in delay fear conditioning are the amygdala, the insula, and the ACC (see review by Sehlmeyer et al.,  ). However, for both fear and eyeblink trace conditioning, declarative memory, which is associated with hippocampus activity, is formed additionally. \n\nTo understand the mechanisms of fear and the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders, it is not sufficient to study the acquisition of fear only. Inappropriate fear can also result from a deficit in extinction of the fear (Baas et al.,  ). Extinction occurs if the CS is presented several times without the US. Importantly, there is convincing evidence that extinction does not lead to forgetting or unlearning, but rather to the formation of a new memory inhibiting the acquired fear memory (Bouton,  ,  ; Milad and Quirk,  ; Myers and Davis,  ; Quirk,  ). To date, the neural structures involved in the extinction of fear are less understood than those involved in fear acquisition. The amygdala has been shown to play an important role in both acquisition and extinction. In addition, it is assumed that, as extinction, i.e., new learning, takes place, the prefrontal cortex inhibits the expression of conditioned fear (Quirk et al.,  ). Rodent models of extinction suggest that during extinction, an inhibitory memory trace between ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala is established (Sotres-Bayon et al.,  ,  ), by means of which the expression of fear is inhibited. The vmPFC activates GABAergic intercalated cells in the amygdala which in turn inhibit the central nucleus of the amygdala (Quirk et al.,  ; Sotres-Bayon et al.,  ). Evidence for this model has been provided by lesion studies (Morgan and LeDoux,  ; Quirk et al.,  ; Morgan et al.,  ; Lebron et al.,  ). For example Morgan and LeDoux ( ) showed that rats with lesions of the medial PFC were resistant to extinction learning in a delay fear conditioning paradigm. Human studies on the extinction of fear memory acquired through classical delay conditioning have confirmed the role of the amygdala and the vmPFC (Phelps et al.,  ; Milad et al.,  ). The insula and the ACC have also been shown to be involved in extinction learning in humans (Gottfried and Dolan,  ; Phelps et al.,  ). Additionally, extinction learning was found to be highly context dependent. Kalisch et al. ( ) for example showed that a network containing the vmPFC and the hippocampus is activated during context dependent recall of extinction memory. \n\nThe striatum seems to be involved in affective learning, too, more precisely in the processing of prediction errors which occur when the expected result does not match the actual result (e.g., Delgado et al.,  ). Besides clear evidence that the striatum is involved in appetitive conditioning (e.g., O'Doherty et al.,  ), there is also growing evidence for its involvement in the processing of prediction errors in aversive conditioning such as classical fear conditioning (Jensen et al.,  ; Delgado et al.,  ). Importantly, the absence of the US during extinction resembles a positive prediction error, meaning that a negative outcome, which is expected, does not occur. Thus, the striatum has to be considered as an important region in the extinction of conditioned fear. \n\nImaging studies examining extinction so far focused on delay conditioning, and little is known about extinction following trace conditioning in humans. Since differences in involved brain regions have been found during acquisition of delay and trace fear conditioning (see discussion above) it is likely that different brain areas are involved during extinction, too. Many situations in real life, in which fear is acquired, are closer to the trace than the delay conditioning paradigm, since there is often a temporal gap between a CS and the predicted US. Given the relevance of fear extinction for the maintenance of anxiety disorders, it seems very important to detect possible differences in the neural networks involved in these different types of fear conditioning. \n\nBased on prior results in humans, we expected that extinction of delay and trace fear conditioning is associated with activations of the amygdala and the vmPFC as well as involvement of the insular and the anterior cingulate cortices and the striatum. In contrast, we assumed differences between delay and trace conditioning regarding activations in the prefrontal cortex. One model of the functional organization of the lateral PFC postulates that the ventrolateral part of the PFC is mainly involved in the maintenance of information, such as retaining a sequence of letters in working memory, whereas the dorsal part is more important when it comes to manipulation of information, such as reordering the sequence into alphabetical order (D'Esposito et al.,  ). There are also findings that nonhuman primates and humans with lesions of the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) are less able to adjust behavior appropriately in delayed response tasks (e.g., D'Esposito et al.,  ). In these tasks it is necessary to hold information in working memory over a short temporal gap before making choices and decisions. This demand is similar to forming and changing a memory trace bridging the trace interval in trace fear conditioning. Therefore, in contrast to vmPFC contributions to the extinction of delay memory, the dlPFC might\u2014exclusively or additionally\u2014be involved in the extinction of trace memory. Evidence for the involvement of the dlPFC in trace eyeblink conditioning also comes from animal models. Weiss and Disterhoft ( ) propose a neural network in which the dlPFC, together with prelimbic areas, orchestrates neural activity that bridges the trace interval. Finally, since the hippocampus is assumed to be involved in the formation of declarative memory in a conditioning process, we expected it to play a greater role in the extinction of trace memory compared to delay memory. \n\nThe present study used virtual reality (VR) to implement both the delay and the trace fear conditioning paradigm. VR is a powerful tool for studying fear reactions in ecologically valid environments (M\u00fchlberger et al.,  , ,  , ). It has successfully been applied in treatment of specific phobias (M\u00fchlberger et al.,  ) as well as in conditioning studies (Baas et al.,  ,  ; Alvarez et al.,  ; Glotzbach et al.,  ; Tr\u00f6ger et al.,  ). The use of VR allows for the full control of a fear conditioning situation that is closer to the complexity of learning situations in real life than most laboratory designs. The used virtual environment consisted of a corridor and an office, through which subjects were passively guided while lying in the scanner. In both the delay (DCG) and the trace conditioning group (TCG), a blue and a yellow light in the office served as CS+ and CS\u2212, respectively, and a mildly painful electric stimulus as US. Besides ratings of valence, arousal, fear, and contingency assessed after acquisition and extinction phases, the BOLD response differences between the CS+ and CS\u2212 served as indices of brain responses related to learning. Specifically, differences between delay and trace fear conditioning during extinction were analyzed. Bold responses during acquisition were not analyzed because of an overlap of brain responses to the CS and US in the learning phase due to their temporal closeness. \n\n\n## Methods and materials \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe final sample consisted of 26 participants, 13 in the DCG (5 male, 8 female, mean age = 23.1 years,   SD   = 3.0 years) and 13 in the TCG (4 male, 9 female, mean age = 23.5 years,   SD   = 2.5 years). All participants gave their written informed consent and received 12 \u20ac/h for participation. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of W\u00fcrzburg. \n\nTo reach this sample, a total of 43 right-handed volunteers (14 male, 29 female; age 19\u201329) had to be recruited. They were randomly assigned to the DCG or the TCG. Excluding criteria were past or present psychiatric disorders, use of antipsychotic drugs, regular alcohol or drug consumption (one subject was excluded), and allochromasia (for blue and yellow) assessed by self-report. Twelve subjects had to be excluded due to technical problems, and one subject because of extensive head movements during scanning. Three participants did not explicitly learn the contingency between the CSs and the US (only DCG, see below). They were also excluded because the small group size did not allow for a separate analysis to investigate distinct neuronal patterns in aware vs. unaware participants. \n\n\n### Stimuli and apparatus \n  \n#### VR environment \n  \nFor creating the virtual environment of the experiment we used the Source Engine SDK (Valve Corporation, Bellevue, Washington, USA). Some office models were used from the free Source Engine Modification \u201cWeekday Warrior\u201d ( ). The virtual environment consisted of an office and an associated corridor evenly illuminated in a neutral white light. In the office, a lamp situated in the middle of the room could be switched on and off. The color of the light illuminated by the lamp was either blue or yellow and served as CS+ or CS\u2212, respectively (see Figure  ). If turned on, the lamp illuminated the whole room. One light (CS+) was followed by a mildly painful electric stimulus (US) with 100% contingency; the other light (CS\u2212) was never followed by an US. Colors of CS+ and CS\u2212 were counterbalanced across participants and groups. In the delay conditioning paradigm, the lights were always switched on for 8 s, and the US was presented simultaneously with the offset of the CS+. In the trace paradigm, the lights were presented for 4 s, and the US was presented 8 s after CS+ onset; thus, the trace interval between CS and US lasted 4 s. To avoid movement in the scanner and enhance control over the course of events during the experiment, participants were guided through the VR environment on a prerecorded path. We used the in-house written VR simulation software CyberSession to manipulate the VR environment during the experiment (e.g., switching on the light, delivering the electrical pulse). VR rendering was done by an image generator running the in-house written Source SDK modification VRSessionMod 0.3. The virtual environment was displayed via MRI-compatible goggles (VisuaStim; Magnetic Resonance Technologies, Northridge, CA, USA). \n  \n Virtual office illuminated in two different lights (right in blue and left in yellow) which served as conditioned stimuli (CS) and with normal illumination (ISI, inter-stimulus interval)  . \n  \n\n#### Electric stimuli \n  \nThe US was a mildly painful electric stimulus generated by a current stimulator (Digitimer DS7A, Digitimer Ltd, Hertfordshire, England). It was delivered at the left index finger through surface bar electrodes consisting of two durable gold-pasted stainless steel disk electrodes with 9mm diameter, 30mm spacing, and with an impedance of max. 5 \u03a9. Electric stimuli associated with the CS+ were triggered automatically by CyberSession during conditioning for 200 ms with a frequency of 50 Hz. Current intensity was determined individually for each participant in the beginning of the experiment (for a detailed description of the adjustment of individual current intensity see Andreatta et al.,  ). It was adjusted at the individual pain threshold and increased by 30% to prevent habituation to the US. Both conditioning groups did not differ in current intensity (delay group:   M   = 2.25 mA,   SD   = 0.99; trace group:   M   = 2.18,   SD   = 0.90),   t   = 0.19,   p   = 0.853, and pain ratings (delay group:   M   = 5.00,   SD   = 0.84; trace group:   M   = 5.04,   SD   = 1.57),   t   = \u22120.08,   p   = 0.934, of the US. \n\n\n\n### Psychometric measures \n  \n#### Ratings \n  \nAt several times during the experiment, ratings of valence (from \u201cvery negative\u201d to \u201cvery positive\u201d), arousal (from \u201cnot arousing at all\u201d to \u201cvery arousing\u201d), fear (from \u201cno fear\u201d to \u201cextreme fear\u201d), and CS\u2013US contingency (from \u201cnot likely at all\u201d to \u201cvery likely\u201d) were collected, each on scales from 0 to 100. \n\n\n#### Awareness \n  \nExplicit knowledge of contingencies between CS and US was assessed on the basis of the question \u201cDuring which light presentation did you receive electric shocks?\u201d Participants who were able to state the correct color of light after the second acquisition run were labeled \u201caware,\u201d the others were labeled \u201cunaware.\u201d While 26 participants met these criteria of awareness; three participants in the DCG failed and were labeled \u201cunaware.\u201d There were no unaware participants in the TCG. \n\n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nAfter reading information about the scanning procedure, participants completed the questionnaires on personal information and excluding criteria. Then they received written instructions related to the experiment and gave their written informed consent. The electrode for electric stimulation was attached when participants were already positioned in the scanner room. After that, the individual pain threshold was determined and adjusted as explained earlier. This preparation phase was followed by a pre-acquisition block, in which participants were guided through the virtual office once to get used to the environment and the two different lights (each light was presented once). After that, participants were told that they would be able to predict the electric stimuli if they paid close attention to the experiment. \n\nThe following acquisition phase consisted of two blocks. Each block included two passages through the office. During one passage, participants were guided through the office once and were exposed to four CS+ and four CS\u2212. The CS+ was always followed by the US. One room visit lasted 172 s; accordingly one block lasted approximately 6 min. During the complete acquisition participants were exposed to 16 CS+ and 16 CS\u2212 and received 16 US. \n\nThe extinction phase consisted of one block including two visits with the same duration and CS frequencies as the acquisition trials (i.e., 8 CS+ and 8 CS\u2212). No US was applied during extinction. \n\nClassification of lights as CS+ and CS\u2212 as well as order of stimuli was pseudo-randomized across participants. In total, there were four different courses of events, two of them with the blue light and two with the yellow light serving as CS+. The length of the interstimulus interval (ISI) was also pseudo-randomized and varied between 11 and 13 s in steps of 250ms. \n\n\n### Ratings \n  \nAfter each of the two acquisition blocks, awareness was measured by posing free recall questions as described above. Participants rated screenshots of the room with either the CS+ or the CS\u2212 light switched on regarding valence, arousal and fear after pre-acquisition, each acquisition block and extinction. Additionally, after both acquisition phases and extinction, contingency of CS+ and CS\u2212 with the US was measured. For all ratings, questions and screenshots were presented via the goggles. Participants were told to relate their answers to the way they felt during the last phase of the experiment. Answers were given orally via the speaker system of the scanner room and recorded by the investigator. \n\n\n### Magnetic resonance imaging \n  \nA 1.5-T whole-body magnetic resonance tomograph (MagnetomAvanto, SiemensHealthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with standard 12-channel head coil and integrated head holder was used for acquisition of structural and functional brain images. Structural imaging consisted of 160 T1-weighted sagittal magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo imaging (MP-RAGE) 3D MRI sequence (MPRAGE, 1mm slice thickness, TR = 2250 ms, TE = 3.93 ms, flip angle: 8\u00b0, FOV: 256mm, matrix: 256 \u00d7 256, voxel size: 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1mm ). The acquisition of structural images was situated at the end of the experiment. \n\nFunctional imaging was conducted in four phases (pre-acquisition, first and second acquisition phase and extinction). During subjective ratings after each of the experimental phases, imaging was intermitted. A total of 161 volumes was registered using a T 2-weighted gradient echo-planar imaging sequence (EPI) with 25 axial slices [slice thickness 5-mm with 1-mm gap, interleaved (descending) order] covering the whole brain (TR: 2500 ms; TE: 40 ms; flip angle: 90\u00b0; FOV: 240 \u00d7 240 mm; matrix size: 64 \u00d7 64; voxel size: 3.1 \u00d7 3.1 \u00d7 3mm ) for functional imaging. Orientation of axial slices was parallel to the AC-PC line. The first 8 images of each phase were excluded from analysis to allow for T1 equilibration. \n\n\n### Image preprocessing and statistical analysis \n  \n#### Imaging \n  \nAnalysis of fMRI data was performed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London) integraded in MatLab 7.0 (Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA). After slice time correction, functional images were realigned. T1-scans were coregistered to each participant's mean image of the realigned. The mean functional images were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) single-subject template (Evans et al.,  ). Normalization parameters obtained from the previous segmentation procedure of coregistered T1 images were applied and images were resampled (voxel size 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2mm ). Subsequently, EPI images were spatially smoothed with an 8-mm full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel and filtered with a 128 ms high pass filter. \n\nThe different experimental conditions were modeled using a boxcar reference vector convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (general linear model, Kiebel and Holmes,  ). The six movement parameters of the rigid body transformation, applied by the realignment procedure, were included to regard variance caused by residual movement. Low-frequency signal drift was filtered using a first-order autoregressive model. Parameter estimates were subsequently calculated for each voxel using weighted least squares to provide maximum likelihood estimates based on the non-sphericity assumption in order to get identical and independently distributed error terms. Since we were especially interested in the activation related to the extinction of fear reactions, the extinction phase served as main test phase and the BOLD signal was calculated at the onset of the colored lights. In a conditioning paradigm with a CS\u2013US contingency of 100% during acquisition we expected rapid decrease of fear reactions. To account for this, the extinction phase was divided into two parts of equal duration and the first and second half were analyzed separately (early and late extinction). In a second step we compared activation during early extinction (first to fourth CS+) with activation during late extinction (fifth to eighth CS+). \n\nFirst level individual contrast images (CS+ > CS\u2212) were used in a second-level analysis (one sample   t  -test). Conditioning groups (delay and trace) were analyzed separately for the contrast CS+ > CS\u2212. We also analyzed the contrast early extinction (CS+ > CS\u2212) > late extinction (CS+ > CS\u2212). ROI analyses were carried out for the amygdala, the hippocampus, the insula, the ACC (Brodmann areas 24, 32, and 33) the striatum (caudate and putamen) and the ventromedial (medial orbital frontal gyrus) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (middle frontal gyrus) at an uncorrected threshold of   p   = 0.005 with a minimum cluster size of ten voxel. Additionally, we conducted an explorative whole brain analysis which also included the cerebellum (  p   = 0.001, uncorrected, minimum cluster size of five voxel). ROIs were based on masks of the WFU Pick Atlas (Maldjian et al.,  ) and Brodmann Areas (BA). \n\n\n#### Ratings \n  \nFor the ratings of valence, arousal, and fear, ANOVAs were conducted for pre-acquisition and extinction with the between factors stimulus (CS+, CS\u2212) and group (delay, trace). Ratings during acquisition were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVAs with the between factors stimulus (CS+, CS\u2212) and group (delay, trace) and the additional within factor phase (Acquisition 1, Acquisition 2). Contingency ratings were not collected after pre-acquisition and thus were only analyzed for acquisition and extinction. \n\nAll rating data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows (Release 17.0). Alpha was set at.05 for all statistical tests, effect sizes are reported as \u03b7  scores. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Ratings \n  \n#### Pre-acquisition \n  \nAs expected, after the pre-acquisition phase, CS+ and CS\u2212 did not differ in valence, arousal, or fear in any group (all   p  s > 0.23). \n\n\n#### Acquisition \n  \n  Valence ratings   . For valence ratings, we found a significant main effect of stimulus,   F   = 13.49,   p   = 0.001, \u03b7  = 0.360, as well as a marginally significant interaction of Phase \u00d7 Stimulus,   F   = 3.92,   p   = 0.059, \u03b7  = 0.140. The CS+ was rated overall more negative than the CS\u2212 (CS+:   M   = 36.83,   SD   = 20.49; CS\u2212:   M   = 65.38,   SD   = 27.88). Significant effects involving the factor group were not detected. \n\n  Arousal rating   . The analysis revealed a significant main effect of stimulus,   F   = 33.05,   p   < 0.001, \u03b7  = 0.579, and a significant three way interaction of Phase \u00d7 Stimulus \u00d7 Group,   F   = 4.30,   p   = 0.049, \u03b7  = 0.152. After the first acquisition phase, the CS+ elicited more arousal than the CS\u2212 in both the delay group,   t   = 2.578,   p   = 0.024 (CS+:   M   = 40.38,   SD   = 25.70; CS\u2212:   M   = 14.62,   SD   = 19.84), and the trace group,   t   = 5.41,   p   < 0.001 (CS+:   M   = 51.15,   SD   = 28.88; CS\u2212:   M   = 8.46,   SD   = 9.87). After the second phase, we found a similar pattern as after the first phase in the trace group,   t   = 4.38,   p   = 0.001 (CS+:   M   = 40.77,   SD   = 26.91; CS\u2212:   M   = 6.92,   SD   = 9.47), while in the delay group the effect was more pronounced than after the first phase,   t   = 3.534,   p   = 0.004, (CS+:   M   = 43.46,   SD   = 27.03; CS\u2212:   M   = 9.62,   SD   = 18.76). \n\n  Fear ratings   . For fear ratings, we again found a significant main effect of stimulus,   F   = 22.32,   p   < 0.000, \u03b7  = 0.482, indicating that the CS+ elicited overall more fear than the CS\u2212 in both groups (CS+:   M   = 36.25,   SD   = 30.40; CS\u2212:   M   = 5.58,   SD   = 11.57). \n\n  Contingency ratings   . The CS+ was clearly perceived as more likely to be followed by an electric stimulus during acquisition, main effect of stimulus,   F   = 201.45,   p   < 0.001, \u03b7  = 0.894 (CS+:   M   = 88.65,   SD   = 18.72; CS\u2212:   M   = 9.62,   SD   = 14.69). Additionally, we found a significant interaction of Phase \u00d7 Stimulus,   F   = 5.66,   p   = 0.026, \u03b7  = 0.191. Already after the first phase, the CS+ was rated as more likely to be followed by the US than the CS\u2212,   t   = 6.681,   p   < 0.001 (CS+:   M   = 81.73,   SD   = 29.29; CS\u2212:   M   = 15.00,   SD   = 27.75), but after the second phase this difference between CS+ and CS\u2212 further increased,   t   = 26.239,   p   < 0.001 (CS+:   M   = 95.58,   SD   = 14.45; CS\u2212:   M   = 4.23,   SD   = 11.38). The contingency between the CS+ and the US was rated higher after the second than after the first phase,   t   = \u22122.612,   p   = 0.015. \n\n\n#### Extinction \n  \n  Valence ratings   . The CS+ and the CS\u2212 did no differ significantly in their valence after extinction,   F   = 3.48,   p   = 0.075, \u03b7  = 0.127, although a marginal difference was still present. \n\n  Arousal ratings   . The analysis revealed a significant main effect of stimulus,   F   = 20.30,   p   < 0.001, \u03b7  = 0.458, as well as a significant interaction of Stimulus \u00d7 Group,   F   = 5.26,   p   = 0.050, \u03b7  = 0.151. In the delay group, arousal ratings of CS+ and the CS\u2212 did not differ significantly. However, in the trace group, the CS+ was still rated as more arousing than the CS\u2212,   t   = 4.368,   p   = 0.001 (CS+:   M   = 21.76,   SD   = 6.03; CS\u2212:   M   = 10.05,   SD   = 2.91). \n\n  Fear ratings   . The main effect of stimulus was still significant after the extinction phase,   F   = 11.61,   p   = 0.002, \u03b7  = 0.326. We also found a marginal interaction of Stimulus x Group,   F   = 3.76,   p   = 0.064, \u03b7  = 0.136, suggesting similar results as for arousal ratings: In the trace group, the CS+ was after extinction still associated with more fear than the CS\u2212,   t   = 3.726,   p   = 0.003 (CS+:   M   = 25.77,   SD   = 21.39; CS\u2212:   M   = 6.15,   SD   = 10.44), while there was no such difference in the delay group,   t   = 1.054,   p   = 0.313. \n\n  Contingency ratings   . As for fear ratings, the main effect of stimulus persisted during the extinction phase,   F   = 18.39,   p   < 0.001, \u03b7  = 0.434. After extinction, the CS+ was still more associated with the US than the CS\u2212 (CS+:   M   = 47.31,   SD   = 35.98; CS\u2212:   M   = 12.31,   SD   = 20.06). \n\nIn sum, arousal and fear ratings suggest that extinction proceeded more slowly in the trace group compared to the delay group. After extinction, the trace group rated the CS+ still as more arousing and more frightening than the CS\u2212, whereas in the delay group these differences were no longer present after extinction. \n\n\n\n### Imaging data \n  \n#### Early extinction \n  \n  ROI analysis   . Regarding the contrast of CS+ minus CS\u2212, both groups showed insular and striatal activation during early extinction. Interestingly, the two groups differed in their prefrontal activation (see Figure  ). In the DCG, we observed significant activation of the vmPFC (medial orbital frontal gyrus R), while in the TCG the dlPFC was significantly activated (middle frontal gyrus R). Additionally, the trace group showed activation of the dorsal part of the ACC (BA 33). \n  \n BOLD Signals (CS+ > CS\u2212) during early extinction (ROI, \u03b1 < 0.005, uncorrected)  . In both DCG and TCG, Insula and Putamen were activated during early extinction. In the DCG, we observed significant activation of the vmPFC (medial orbital frontal gyrus R), while in the TCG the dlPFC (middle frontal gyrus R) was significantly activated. \n  \n  Whole brain analysis   . In addition to the areas defined as ROIs, we also found significant activation in several other regions. In the DCG, the cuneus (L), the left motor cortex (precentral gyrus L), and the middle occipital gyrus (R) were activated. In the TCG, we found activations in the somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus L), the calcarine (R), the rolandic operculum (R), and the ventral ACC (middle cingulate cortex L, BA 24). \n\nFor exact coordinates see Table  . \n  \n Significant activations revealed by whole brain (WB) and regions of interest (ROI) analysis for contrast CS+ > CS\u2212 during early extinction  . \n  \n\u03b1 < 0.001 uncorrected for whole brain analysis (WB) and \u03b1 < 0.005, uncorrected ROI analyses, with a minimum cluster size of k = 5 (WB) or k = 10 (ROI); L, left; R, right hemisphere. The cluster with the largest number of significant voxels within each region is reported.

For the second phase of extinction, we observed significant activation in the ventral part of the ACC in the DCG only. \n\n  Whole brain analysis   . In the DCG, the ventral ACC (R), the inferior frontal gyrus (R), and the supramarginal gyrus (R) were activated during late extinction. In the TCG however, we found significant activation of the precuneus (L and R). \n\nFor exact coordinates see Table  . \n  \n Significant activations revealed by whole brain (WB) and regions of interest (ROI) analysis for contrast CS+ > CS\u2212 during late extinction  . \n  \n\u03b1 < 0.001 uncorrected for whole brain analysis (WB) and \u03b1 < 0.005, uncorrected ROI analyses, with a minimum cluster size of k = 5 (WB) or k = 10 (ROI); L, left; R, right hemisphere. The cluster with the largest number of significant voxels within each region is reported. Coordinates x, y, and z of the peak voxels are given in Montreal Neurological Institute space. \n  \n\n#### Early extinction > late extinction \n  \n  ROI analysis   . We also tested for areas, which showed stronger activation in the early extinction than in the late extinction. In the delay group, this was the case for the insula (L), whereas in the trace group the hippocampus (R) and the striatum (putamen L) showed greater activation in the first part of the extinction compared to the second part. \n\n  Whole brain analysis   . Whole brain analysis revealed additional activation of the ACC (ventral anterior cingulate area), the precentral gyrus (L), and the transverse temporal gyrus (Heschl L) in the DCG. In the TCG, the ventral ACC (L) was activated as in the delay group, and additionally we found activation in the parahippocampal area. \n\nFor exact coordinates see Table  . \n  \n Early extinction (CS+ > CS\u2212) > late extinction (CS+ > CS\u2212): significant activations revealed by whole brain (WB) and regions of interest (ROI) analysis  . \n  \n\u03b1 < 0.001 uncorrected for whole brain analysis (WB) and \u03b1 < 0.005, uncorrected ROI analyses, with a minimum cluster size of k = 5 (WB) or k = 10 (ROI); L, left; R, right hemisphere. The cluster with the largest number of significant voxels within each region is reported. Coordinates x, y, and z of the peak voxels are given in Montreal Neurological Institute space. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first study investigating neural substrates of extinction of both delay and trace fear memory in humans. In both conditioning groups we found activation in the insular cortex and the striatum during early extinction. Interestingly, extinction of delay and trace memory differed in prefrontal activation. The vmPFC was activated during extinction in the DCG, while the dlPFC was activated during extinction in the TCG. These results point to different PFC activity involved in early extinction of delay vs. trace fear conditioning. In the late part of the extinction process, the delay group only showed significant activation of the ventral ACC. No other activation could be found in our predefined regions of interest during the second half of extinction. However, when comparing the early with the late part of extinction, we found greater activation in the insula (delay group), the hippocampus, and the striatum (trace group) during early extinction. \n\n### Prefrontal cortex \n  \nThe most prominent result of our study is the dissociation of prefrontal activation in delay vs. trace conditioning during early extinction. As has been shown in previous human fear conditioning studies, the vmPFC plays an important role in the extinction of fear memory (e.g., Phelps et al.,  ). In accordance with findings from the animal model it is assumed that, during extinction, an inhibitory memory trace is formed between the vmPFC and the amygdala (Sotres-Bayon et al.,  ,  ), which allows for the modulation of the fear response. However, existing evidence from human studies for this model comes exclusively from delay fear conditioning. Significant activation of the vmPFC in the DCG of our study provides further evidence for this model. Milad et al. ( ) indicated that the vmPFC is not only involved in extinction learning, but also in the retention of extinction memory. They reported a significant correlation between the thickness of the medial orbitofrontal cortex and skin conductance response (SCR) in extinction recall assessed one day after extinction training. More precisely, a thicker medial orbitofrontal cortex was associated with a lower SCR in extinction recall, that is, with greater extinction memory. \n\nHowever, in the TCG, we did not find significant activation of the vmPFC, but instead of the dlPFC. This finding points to different processes during extinction in delay and trace conditioning. VmPFC activation in delay conditioning reflects the inhibition of the fear response already during early extinction. According to a model of functional organization of the lateral PFC, the vmPFC is mainly involved in the mere maintenance of information, whereas the dorsal part is assumed to be involved in the manipulation of information, requiring more working memory capacities (D'Esposito et al.,  ; Postle et al.,  ). As mentioned in the introduction, lesion studies in nonhuman and human primates indicate that the dlPFC is important for adjusting behavior appropriately in delayed response tasks (e.g., D'Esposito et al.,  ), in which information has to be kept in working memory for a short period of time before making choices and decisions on the basis of this information. This interpretation is in line with activation of the dlPFC during the extinction of trace conditioning. In contrast to delay conditioning, trace conditioning and its extinction afford higher working memory contribution to bridge the trace interval and hold information in short term memory. Results of ratings indicate that extinction proceeded more slowly in the trace group compared to the delay group. In the DCG, we did no longer find differences in arousal and fear ratings of the CS+ compared to the CS\u2212 after extinction. However, the CS+ was still rated more arousing and more frightening than the CS\u2212 in the TCG. A slower extinction process in the trace group can be seen as an indication for a higher working memory contribution in the extinction of trace conditioning and therefore may account for different processes of extinction in delay and trace conditioning. There is also an interesting connection between our findings and evidence from trace eyeblink conditioning in rabbits (Weiss and Disterhoft,  ). They assume an important role of the dlPFC in the acquisition of trace conditioning: Activation of dlPFC and hippocampus potentiates the effect of the CS at pontine nuclei on the way to the cerebellum and thus bridge the trace interval during acquisition. After consolidation of the CS+/US association, structures mediating the conditioned response reorganize. While the hippocampus becomes less important, the dlPFC becomes more important. Further research with regard to both acquisition and extinction is necessary for investigating to what extend these findings from the animal model can be transferred to classical conditioning in humans. \n\n\n### Insula and ACC \n  \nIn both conditioning groups we found activation of the insular cortex during early extinction. Additionally, the insula showed greater activation in the early compared to the late extinction in the delay group. Evidence for the involvement of the insula in classical fear conditioning comes, among others, from Phelps et al. ( ): In contrast to the instructed fear paradigm, in which the insula was activated already in early trials, the activation in the conditioning paradigm occurred not until the later trials of acquisition, when participants were consciously aware of the association between the CS+ and the US. These findings are consistent with evidence coming from pain research showing that the insula plays an important role in the anticipation of pain (e.g., Ploghaus et al.,  ; Wiech et al.,  ). Phelps et al. ( ) suggest that the anticipation of pain leads to a cortical representation of fear, which is transmitted to the amygdala via the insular cortex. During early extinction of fear memory, the CS+ is no longer followed by a painful stimulus. However, it is still associated with the US and thus leads to the anticipation of pain, resulting in the observed activation of the insular cortex. Interestingly, during extinction of both trace and delay fear conditioning, insular activation was limited to the right hemisphere. The left insula has been associated with semantic processing which is necessary in instructed fear conditioning. In contrast, the right insula has been associated with the response to a sensory aversive US like for example the mildly painful electric stimulus we applied (for further information see for example Craig,  ). \n\nIn addition to the insula, the dorsal ACC was activated during early extinction in the TCG. Moreover, we found stronger activation of the ACC during early extinction compared to late extinction in both groups. The combined activation of the ACC and the insula has been discussed to represent a pathway for the integration of nociceptive input in memory processes (Coghill et al.,  ). According to this model, both structures are involved in the adjustment of behavior in response to a stimulus predicting pain (see also B\u00fcchel et al.,  ). The ACC has also been associated with sustained attention toward a stimulus that might be followed by pain (Yaguez et al.,  ). There is broad evidence that sustained attention is necessary for trace fear conditioning, but not for delay conditioning. In a trace conditioning paradigm, fear memory is only established when subjects are consciously aware of the CS\u2013US contingency. However, in delay paradigm, conditioning can also occur when participants have not formed declarative memory and thus are unaware of the association between the CS and the US (e.g., Manns et al.,  ; Clark et al.,  ; Weike et al.,  ). Han et al. ( ) have shown that attention-distracting stimuli interfere with trace but not delay or contextual fear conditioning in mice. Moreover, they found a higher density of c-fos-positive cells in the ACC of mice that had undergone trace fear conditioning compared to delay conditioning. In the same study, lesions of the ACC selectively impaired trace conditioning. These results give additional evidence for the association of ACC activation and sustained attention during trace fear conditioning, and also offer an explanation why we found combined activation of the insula and the ACC only during the early extinction of trace but not delay fear memory. \n\n\n### Striatum \n  \nDuring acquisition of fear memory, the expectation is formed that an initially neutral stimulus is followed by a negative event such as an electric stimulus. During extinction, this expectation is violated: The negative event does no longer occur. This discrepancy between the expected and the actual outcome is referred to as prediction error (e.g., Schultz et al.,  ). The striatum has been shown to be involved in the coding of prediction errors in both appetitive and also aversive classical and instrumental conditioning. This applies to primary reinforcers such as pain (Phelps et al.,  ; Seymour et al.,  ), but also to secondary ones such as monetary gains (e.g., Delgado,  ). In our study, we found striatal activation in both the DCG and the TCG. These results provide further evidence for the important role of the striatum not only in the acquistion (Jensen et al.,  ; Delgado et al.,  ; Klucken et al.,  ; Tabbert et al.,  ), but also in the extinction of fear memory and therefore in the coding of prediction errors characterized by the omission of a negative outcome. Raczka et al. ( ) recently showed that a functional polymorphism of the dopamine transporter gene, which is mainly expressed in the striatum, influences extinction learning. The 9-repeat allele is associated with enhanced phasic dopamine release and with higher learning rates in the extinction of conditioned fear. In 9R carriers they also found stronger activation of the ventral striatum in response to prediction errors during extinction. In relation to these findings they assumed that extinction is an appetitive-like learning process mediated by the mesostriatal dopamine system, rather than a learning process driven by an aversive prediction error. \n\n\n### Hippocampus \n  \nThe hippocampus has been found to be involved in the representation of the temporal context in a conditioning process, which plays an important role in a trace paradigm including a temporal gap between CS+ and US (e.g., Phillips and LeDoux,  ). In the TCG, we found greater hippocampal activation in the comparison of early vs. late extinction. Clark et al. ( ) stated that the hippocampus is crucial for explicit or declarative memory processes. According to them, trace conditioning requires declarative knowledge and therefore hippocampus activity because the temporal gap between the CS and the US makes it difficult to process the CS\u2013US relationship in an automatic, reflexive way. Knight et al. ( ) found hippocampal activation during extinction as well. They also reported a rapid decrease of its activation during the early trials of extinction. \n\n\n### Amydala \n  \nWe did not find significant activation of the amygdala in either one of the two groups. One possible reason for this is the rapid habituation of amygdala activity during extinction learning, especially in a conditioning paradigm with 100% contingency of CS+ and US during acquisition (e.g., LaBar et al.,  ). Secondly, EPI is highly vulnerable to susceptibility artifacts, which occur near the interfaces of substance of different magnetic susceptibility and thus are likely in structures of the medial temporal lobe, like the amygdala (Bellgowan et al.,  ; Stocker et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nIn sum, our results add further evidence for the involvement of the PFC, insula, ACC, striatum, and hippocampus in the extinction of conditioned fear memory. We could also confirm that the ACC and the hippocampus are mainly involved in trace conditioning processes. The ACC has been associated with sustained attention, which is necessary for trace but not delay conditioning. The hippocampus is assumed to be necessary for the processing of the temporal context necessary to bridge the trace interval. Most important, our results indicate that different parts of the PFC are activated during extinction of delay vs. trace fear conditioning, the vmPFC vs. the dlPFC, respectively. These results point to different underlying processes during extinction of these two types of conditioning. Due to limited power of our study and a relatively liberal level of significance, results have to be interpreted with care. More evidence is needed to elucidate the role of the PFC in the extinction of trace conditioning in more detail and to translate results from the animal model to human trace fear conditioning \n\n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nProf. Paul Pauli and Prof. Andreas M\u00fchlberger are Shareholders of a commercial company that develops virtual environment research systems for empirical studies in the field of psychology, psychiatry, and psychotherapy.

As ASL allows to quantify the cerebral blood flow, unlike BOLD, rs-ASL can lead to significant clinical subject-scaled applications. Despite directly impacting clinical practicability and functional networks estimation, there is no standard for rs-ASL regarding the acquisition duration. Our work here focuses on assessing the feasibility of ASL as an rs-fMRI method and on studying the effect of the acquisition duration on the estimation of functional networks. To this end, we acquired a long 24 min 30 s rs-ASL sequence and investigated how estimations of six typical functional brain networks evolved with respect to the acquisition duration. Our results show that, after a certain acquisition duration, the estimations of all functional networks reach their best and are stabilized. Since, for clinical application, the acquisition duration should be the shortest possible, we suggest an acquisition duration of 14 min, i.e., 240 volumes with our sequence parameters, as it covers the functional networks estimation stabilization. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nFunctional MR imaging (fMRI) builds the links between location and function in the brain. The two main sub-domains in fMRI are task-based fMRI and resting-state fMRI. In task-based fMRI, the location of a function is considered to be where the acquired signal matches with the task guidelines given to the subject (Poldrack et al.,  ). In resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), as no task is given, the focus is on fluctuations in voxels time-series induced by spontaneous neural activations. Similarities in these time-series in different areas have been shown to not be random but to be matching the function of the brain (Biswal et al.,  ). These similarities between neural activation pattern define the   functional connectivity   of the brain, and show the underlying cerebral architecture is organized into functional specialized units, called networks, communicating with each other (Varoquaux and Craddock,  ; Fan et al.,  ). Resting-state functional imaging aims to identify functional networks of the brain and to depict how they interact outside any structural connectivity consideration (Van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol,  ). As the resting-state is rather easy to achieve, especially for the pediatric and elderly population but also for cognitive impaired patients, rs-fMRI has found some niche clinical applications in diseases investigation. The key concept is to consider the brain as a unique integrative network of the estimated functional networks, assimilated with the mathematical structure of a graph (Van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol,  ; Wang et al.,  ). The graph properties model the functional architecture: each node corresponds to a functional network, and edges configuration depicts how they interdepend. For instance, functional connectivity is altered in disease like schizophrenia (Lynall et al.,  ; Kindler et al.,  ), major depression (Mulders et al.,  ), Alzheimer's disease (Sanz-Arigita et al.,  ; Agosta et al.,  ). Rs-fMRI, as a global investigation of function, is also appropriate for neurodegenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis (Faivre et al.,  ; Filippi et al.,  ; Cruz-G\u00f3mez et al.,  ), Parkinson's disease (Gao and Wu,  ), or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Mohammadi et al.,  ; Trojsi et al.,  ). \n\nAnother subdivision in fMRI concerns the way the signal is obtained. The two major techniques are Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI and functional Arterial Spin Labeling (fASL). Based on neurovascular coupling effects, BOLD techniques rely on the local signal variation induced by the neuron consumption of blood oxygen (Kim and Ugurbil,  ). Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) is an MRI perfusion technique that uses magnetically labeled arterial water protons as an endogenous tracer (Detre et al.,  ). An inversion pulse labels the inflowing blood, and, after a delay called the post-labeling delay, a labeled image of the volume of interest is acquired. The subtraction of the labeled image from a control image, i.e., non-labeled, reflects the quantity of spins that have perfused the imaged volume, producing what is commonly called a perfusion-weighted (PW) image. The PW map can be used to quantify the cerebral blood flow (CBF) under some assumptions (Buxton et al.,  ; Borogovac and Asllani,  ). The absence of a contrast agent injection makes ASL well-suited for CBF longitudinal studies, particularly for a pediatric population or for a population with poor venous access or contrast agent contraindication. The quantification of CBF is the main advantage of ASL over BOLD. Indeed, a BOLD signal provides an indirect and non-quantitative measurement of neural activity, as it results from a combination of variations in CBF, cerebral blood volume, and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (Buxton,  ). The main drawback of ASL is its lower signal-to-noise ratio compared to BOLD fMRI. The repetition time (TR) is also twice to three times higher in rs-ASL compared to resting-state BOLD (rs-BOLD), which impacts its temporal resolution. Furthermore, ASL can be implemented through numerous MRI sequences, and meta-analyses can be difficult to set up, as ASL shows a high sequence parameter dependency (Buxton et al.,  ; Grade et al.,  ; Mutsaerts et al.,  ). Nevertheless, a consensus seems to be emerging over the years (Alsop et al.,  ). BOLD is, however, predominant in clinical usage and in academic research and is therefore considered the gold standard in rs-fMRI. Consequently, rs-ASL has been mostly used for research purposes. However, the recent increasing involvement of all MRI stakeholders is highly beneficial in order to further develop rs-ASL usage in terms of a guide for clinical practitioners (Grade et al.,  ) as well as consensus on implementation (Alsop et al.,  ), feasibility, and viability (Chen et al.,  ). Despite its lower SNR, but thanks to its closer proximity to neural activation (Duong et al.,  ; Tjandra et al.,  ) and CBF quantification, rs-ASL has been proven to be a serious contender to resting-state BOLD in schizophrenia (Zhu et al.,  ) and Alzheimer's disease (Alsop et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ). Resting-state ASL has also found its own clinical applications with investigation of chronic fatigue syndrome (Boissoneault et al.,  ) and catatonia (Walther et al.,  ). \n\nThe acquisition duration is an important parameter in an rs-fMRI study with strong practical consequences. Most current rs-ASL studies work with a duration from 8 to 13 min and a TR from 3 to 4 s, i.e., 120\u2013260 images. Intuitively, one would assume the longer the duration the better the sampling of the signal correlation across the brain and, thus, the better the acquisition. However, this requires us to define what \u201cbetter\u201d actually means and does not consider the practical questions of clinical implementation and subject resting-state upholding. To the best of our knowledge, some papers already studied the influence of duration in rs-BOLD (Van Dijk et al.,  ; Anderson et al.,  ; Birn et al.,  ; Laumann et al.,  ; Termenon et al.,  ; Bouix et al.,  ), whereas, in rs-ASL, it has not been explored yet. In this work, we first focus on the feasibility of detecting functional networks with rs-ASL. We remain as close as what a typical investigator of rs-ASL would experience by implementing usual sequence, processing, and functional networks detection methods. We then assess a trend over the duration influence on rs-ASL detected networks quality: we do not directly assess whether an acquisition is good at a given time but rather how it evolves with longer durations. After describing the scores used and the modeling approach, an in-depth analysis for the Default-Mode Network (DMN) will be presented in order to illustrate scores evolution on the most typical resting-state network. Finally, we will show results for all the functional networks under consideration and discuss a recommended sequence duration in rs-ASL. \n\n\n## 2. Materials \n  \n### 2.1. Subjects \n  \nSeven healthy male right-handed subjects aged from 21 to 28 years (23.5 yo \u00b1 2.5) were involved in this study. All subjects gave written informed consent before participating in the study. We have maintained the homogeneity of the population in order to limit the influence of factors, such as gender or age. \n\n\n### 2.2. MR Acquisitions \n  \nThe subjects were scanned on a 3.0T whole body Siemens MR scanner (Magnetom Verio, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head coil. A 3D anatomical T1-weighted MP2RAGE image was acquired for each subject. The resting-state ASL imaging was performed using a 2D EPI pseudo-continuous (pCASL) sequence. Subjects were asked to keep their eyes closed, to relax (mind-wandering), to lie still and to not fall asleep. We used common parameters reported in the literature: TR = 3,500 ms, FoV = 224 \u00d7 224 mm , TE = 12 ms, LD = 1,500 ms and a 1250 ms post-labeling delay (PLD) at the first slice (1712.5 ms at the median slice). Volumes were made of 24 slices of 64 \u00d7 64 voxels with 5 mm slice thickness with 20% gap for a total resolution of 3.5 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 6 mm . The number of volumes was 420 for a total duration of 24 min 30 s. \n\n\n### 2.3. Data Pre-processing \n  \nFor each subject, the raw pCASL series is divided into 46 sub-series. The duration of these sub-series ranges from nearly 2 min (34 volumes) to 24 min 30 s (420 volumes) with a time step of 30 s. For the sake of simplicity, we will only mention rounded durations hereafter. All these subdivisions are made   before   any preprocessing: the preprocessing is done independently on each sub-series. For the preprocessing steps and their parameters, we chose the most common ones found in bibliography. While identifying the best preprocessing is still an open topic in rs-ASL in particular and in rs-fMRI in general (Gargouri et al.,  ), a general routine can be discerned in the literature. For the preprocessing steps, we used Matlab CONN toolbox ( ,  ) (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon,  ). Preprocessing starts with the realignment of the functional data. All the functional volumes are rigidly registered to the first one using SPM12 realign procedure (Andersson et al.,  ). Second step is the indirect normalization of the functional volumes (Nieto-Castanon,  ). It starts with the affine registration of the functional data, with the mean volume of the realigned series as the source image, on the anatomical 3D T1 using SPM12 inter-modality co-registration procedure with a normalized mutual information cost function. Then the anatomical image is registered on the MNI 152 template using SPM12 unified segmentation and normalization procedure (Ashburner and Friston,  ). In parallel, perfusion-weighted maps are computed using a surround subtraction on the realigned functional data. Both transformations (functional to structural, structural to MNI) are composed to register subtracted functional data on the MNI template. We then used Gaussian smoothing with a typical 6 mm FWHM radius (Alak\u00f6rkk\u00f6 et al.,  ) and pass-band filtering with a range from 0.005 to 0.1 Hz. Final denoising was made with aCOMPCOR, using five regressors for white-matter, five for cerebro-spinal fluid, and the 12 from the realignment step (Behzadi et al.,  ). All these steps are shown in  . \n  \nPreprocessing starts with a realignment: all the functional volumes are registered with the first one. Second step is the indirect normalization of the functional volumes. The functional data is registered on the anatomical 3D T1 (a). Then the anatomical image is registered on the MNI 152 template (b). After a surround subtraction (c), transformations of (a) and (b) are composed to register functional data on the MNI template (d). We then used Gaussian smoothing with a typical 6 mm FWHM radius and pass-band filtering with a range from 0.005 to 0.1 Hz. Final denoising is made with COMPCOR. \n  \n\n\n## 3. Methods \n  \n### 3.1. Detecting Networks With Seed-Based Analysis \n  \nTo obtain the mapping of individual functional networks, we relied on seed-based analysis (SBA) (Van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol,  ). The principle of this method, the first proposed to define functional connectivity (Biswal et al.,  ), is quite straightforward. Considering a similarity measure [usually linear correlation, but many others exist (Zhou et al.,  )], SBA builds functional areas by gathering voxels which exhibit a matching signal, in the sense of the chosen measure, to that of a ROI, called the seed in this context. Even if SBA is a very polymorphic modeling method, we used its most common form in our work. We therefore considered linear correlation as the similarity measure and used a set of 20 single voxels as seeds. Seeds are spread in the expected location of six usual functional networks: DMN, Sensori-motor, Language, Salience, Visual, and Cerebellum. The exact positions of the seeds in the MNI152 space are provided in the   section and were suggested by the CONN toolbox. Each seed provides a linear correlation map of the brain. To estimate a functional network for each seed, we statistically tested whether the signal between the seed and a candidate voxel is positively correlated with a risk of 1% FWER-corrected with Bonferroni procedure. This is a tough conservative testing compared to most of rs-ASL (even fMRI in general) studies, but we agree with the recommendation of Eklund et al. ( ) on false positives underestimation in fMRI literature. \n\n\n### 3.2. Evaluation Scores \n  \nThe resting-state BOLD literature suggests different acquisition durations: 6 min (Van Dijk et al.,  ), 10 min (Bouix et al.,  ), 12 min (Birn et al.,  ), 25 min (Anderson et al.,  ), and even 100 min (Laumann et al.,  ). In Termenon et al. ( ), Termenon et al. focus on the tradeoff that can be made between duration and number of subjects in a group study. They recommend durations ranging from 7 min for 100 subjects to 14 min for 40 subjects. The main reason of their apparent discrepancy is the modeling. Indeed, there are many ways to properly define a model to assess the role of acquisition duration (  a fortiori   how much duration is enough), even if they lead to different conclusions. As a pioneer work on rs-ASL, we wanted our modeling to reflect an investigator's experience with the impact of acquisition duration on functional network estimation.   illustrates the investigation of acquisition duration we will model. The DMN estimation is validated after 14 min on   because it matches with how the functional network is expected to look like. In modeling terms, it is basically assessing the overlap of the estimated network with a reference network. In order to investigate a trend afterwards and decide which acquisition duration is enough, the individual functional maps were compared to a reference, as in process described in  . For that purpose, we relied on the Multi-Subjects Dictionary Learning atlas (MSDL) by Varoquaux et al. ( ). The MSDL is an atlas of 17 resting-state functional networks containing our six networks of interest and from which our seeds and subjects are independent. The key idea is to have functional maps close to what an expert would expect to observe when looking for the typical functional areas investigated here. To study the quality of the detected networks as a function of the acquisition duration, we evaluated the overlap between the SBA estimated functional maps and the MSDL references (simply called \u201creference\u201d hereafter) through two measures: the Jaccard's index and the area under curve (AUC). \n  \nSeed-based estimation of subject 3 DMN with posterior seed at different acquisition durations. Four stages can be identified. At 2 min (1), the map mostly shows false positive noise detection. Between 4 and 8 min (2), the false positive noise has disappeared while the posterior component of the DMN starts growing. Between 10 and 12 min (3), the posterior component is well-detected, and the frontal and the lateral components have appeared, but quite poorly. At 14 min and after (4), DMN detection is good and interestingly, stable. \n  \nLet   be a set, let   be observations in   and   binary categorical variables. In fMRI,   is the voxels space, the   v   are the voxels, and the variables   M  ,   M   are the functional networks to be compared, which associate to each voxel   v  : 1 if the voxel belong to the functional network, 0 otherwise. The definition of   M   and   M   is binary here, but it can easily be extended to probability maps. In our case,   M   corresponds to the estimation of a functional network, and   M   corresponds to the functional network reference from the MSDL. Let   A  ,  B  ,  C  ,  D   be four sets with the respective cardinals   a  ,  b  ,  c  ,  d   defined by \n\nAlmost all common similarity measures (Sokal measure family, S\u00f8rensen-Dice, correlation etc.) can be defined with   a  ,  b  ,  c  ,  d  , e.g., S\u00f8rensen-Dice score: 2  a  /(2  a   +   b   +   c  ). As   M   (MSDL reference) can be considered as a ground-truth, therefore   a   becomes the number of   True Positives  ,   b   of   False Positives  ,   c   of   False Negatives   and   d   of   True Negatives  . We also have the   Sensitivity  :   a  /(  a   +   c  ),   Specificity  :   d  /(  d   +   b  ), and the   Positive Predicted Value   (PPV):   a  /(  a   +   b  ). \n\n#### 3.2.1. Jaccard's Index \n  \nWhen comparing two spatially distributed data like functional networks, a straightforward measure is the Jaccard's index. It is the ratio between the size of the functional networks' intersection and their union. It is defined by   J   =   a  /(  a   +   b   +   c  ) in our notation system. It provides intuitive and visual information about the overlap between one SBA estimation of functional network and one reference network from the MSDL. It is also test-dependent: changing the risk or the multiple comparisons correction at the estimation step will also change the shape and extent of the functional network, generally modifying Jaccard's index. This may be considered as a drawback, but, in fact, a statistical test is usually used at some point when investigating fMRI data. \n\n\n#### 3.2.2. Receiver Operating Characteristic Analysis \n  \nIn this section, we assume that the binary categorical variables are parameterized by at least one parameter. For example, in our case, it could be the   p  -value for the statistical test of correlation \u03b1 that was used to estimate functional networks from the correlation map. Let   r   be our parameter,   a  ,   b  ,   c  , and   d   the previously defined cardinals in (1) now parameterized by   r  , and let define a set {(  x  (  r  ),   y  (  r  )),   r   \u2208 [\u22121, 1]} \u2282 [0, 1]  by \n\nThe implicitly defined function   f   :   x   \u21a6   y   is called the   Receiver operating characteristic curve   (ROC-curve), and its integral   is simply called the   Area Under Curve   (AUC). In the case where   M   is considered to be the truth,   f   is just informally   f   : 1 \u2212   Specificity   \u21a6   Sensitivity  . The AUC has the interesting property to not be test-dependent, as it covers all possible values of the threshold parameter (e.g., risk/correlation). It illustrates how a functional map can be close to the reference by considering all values of the considered parameter, while the Jaccard's index reflects how it is close to the reference by considering one value of the given parameter. Hence AUC seems a better way to assess the trend of interest from a theoretical point of view. However, it is further away from the practical proximity and easier interpretation of the Jaccard's index modeling offers. \n\n\n\n### 3.3. Modeling Scores Evolution With Respect to the Duration \n  \nWith each of the 20 seeds are 322 associated functional network estimations that correspond to seven estimations per each of the 46 different acquisition durations (seven subjects, 46 sub-series). For each seed, and for one of the six functional network references from the MSDL, both Jaccard's index and AUC are computed between the reference and the 322 estimations associated with the seed. The last step is to model the scores evolution according to the acquisition duration for all subjects and for each combination between one seed and one reference. Let us first check assumptions to select a suitable regression model. Assuming the rs-ASL sequence lasts long enough to cover all usage with 24 min 30 s, extrapolation for a duration longer than 24 min 30 s seems superfluous. We are not interested in an explicit formula between scores and acquisition duration, as there is no theoretical model, even in BOLD, on the dependence between acquisition duration and functional network estimation. Moreover, even processed independently, within-subject functional networks estimations have a strong dependency since they come from the same acquisition. Under these three conditions, a local non-parametric regression is very well-suited. We chose to use the LOESS regression model (Cleveland and Devlin,  ). While the model name is a reference to a geological structure, LOESS is commonly understood as \u201clocally estimated scatterplot smoothing\u201d. LOESS is a local polynomial regression computed on subsets of the whole dataset with each subset being defined for each time-points by a weighted K-nearest neighbors algorithm. We used second degree polynomial functions with a 0.8 span. For a more comprehensive description of LOESS, see Cleveland and Devlin ( ). A LOESS regression curve is computed for each score on each set of 322 overlap scores corresponding to one combination of seed and MSDL references. \n\n\n\n## 4. Results \n  \n### 4.1. Effect of the Acquisition Duration for the Default Mode Network \n  \nIn this section, we present an in-depth analysis of the DMN. In the set of 20 seeds we used, many should not be inspected when used in combination with MSDL DMN. The main reason is that most of the combinations have no objective basis for detecting the DMN. Otherwise, the seed may have failed to detect precisely the networks it was meant to detect, which is expected with very short acquisition duration. A good way to get an idea of the quality of the overlap between the functional maps associated with a seed and a reference for all durations is to check the boxplots of the Jaccard's index as in  . Boxplots give an overview of the results for rs-ASL: for the DMN reference, Jaccard's indices have higher values for the seeds placed in order to detect it. Prefrontal and posterior seeds seem to work well, while lateral DMN seeds provide lower scores but still higher than any other seeds.   shows the evolution of the estimated DMN with the posterior seed and corresponding scores for one subject. The depiction made by the scores of the overlap between the estimation of the DMN and the MSDL reference matches with the four stages identified in  .   shows the Jaccard's index, AUC, Sensitivity and Predicted Positive Value (PPV) for each subject and at each acquisition duration. We chose to report the positive predicted value rather than specificity for two main reasons. On the one hand, true negatives can have multiple definitions in fMRI since it depends on the voxels considered: the whole volume, only the brain, or any smaller ROI, such as gray matter. Although it is logical to consider only brain voxels for functional activity, this implies an extremely high number of true negatives since the volume of a functional network is 10\u2013100 times smaller than the one of the whole brain. Therefore, the specificity reaches values too high to provide relevant information on similarity between functional areas. On the other hand, like specificity, PPV plays a similar role with respect to sensitivity: specificity gives a complementary information to sensitivity in the totality of voxels whereas PPV gives a complementary information in the union of the reference and the estimated functional area. LOESS on Jaccard's index, as well as on AUC, models quite well what can be observed by looking directly at the functional map as in  . Jaccard's index seems to stabilize after 12\u201313 min and AUC at an earlier acquisition duration around 9\u201310 min. We could have expected sensitivity and PPV to follow the same trend. Actually, sensitivity just grows over time but more slowly for longer durations. Interestingly, PPV reaches a peak in the second stage mentioned above. The seven subjects show different levels of response but good correlations (except for the subject 2 with AUC), i.e., the trend is the same among subject, rather than an average effect induced by the LOESS. Moreover, results observed for the DMN can be generalized for almost every combination of seeds and references as we will see. \n  \nEach boxplot corresponds to one seed and shows the distribution of Jaccard's index between the estimated functional area corresponding to the considered seed on the one hand, and the MSDL DMN reference on the other hand, for all subjects and all durations. The seeds are grouped by color, each corresponding to one of the six functional areas considered. As expected, the seeds located in the expected DMN location (in pink) give the best results. \n    \nSubject 4 DMN detection (in blue) with prefrontal seed and MSDL DMN reference (in red) over a 2\u201324 min duration with 2 min steps. Maps are shown in MNI152 space. \n    \nJaccard's indices   (A)  , AUC   (B)  , Positive Predicted Value   (C)  , and Sensitivity   (D)   evolution with time with their associated LOESS curve for the seed associated with prefrontal DMN. On all subjects, Jaccard's index increases with duration before 10\u201312 min, then stabilizes. The AUC shows the same trend with an earlier stabilization, around 9\u201310 min. PPV grows rapidly, reaches a peak at 8 min, then decreases slowly. Finally, Sensitivity increases with time, but more slowly for longer durations. Subjects show different level of response but good correlations. \n  \n\n### 4.2. Effect of the Acquisition Duration for All Functional Networks \n  \nAs seen for the DMN, many combinations between seeds and references should not be investigated since they are not functionally meaningful and will yield to very low overlapping scores (e.g., prefrontal seed with visual cortex). With more than 6,000 functional maps generated (20 seeds, seven subjects, 46 different acquisition durations), a visual checking of all the maps is not practicable in order to discard seeds that failed to detect corresponding functional networks. In order to investigate only combinations between seeds and references that provide successful detections, we use empirical criteria on the scores distribution. For Jaccard's index, we select the combinations for which at least 50% of observations have   J   \u2a7e 0.1. The reasoning behind the choice of the criterion was as follows. With   and additional visual inspections on different subjects, we observe that the seed in prefrontal cortex is successful in the detection of the DMN after a certain acquisition duration. Hence, the corresponding boxplot to the prefrontal seeds in   provides a Jaccard's index distribution of a successful seed. We assume then that the combinations between seeds and references that have a similar distribution or a better one (i.e., higher values) also correspond to seeds that are able to provide successful estimation of functional networks. We choose to characterize these seeds considered as successful in the estimation, and   a fortiori  , corresponding boxplots, when the median is above 0.1. Using the same considerations on AUC, we also considered the median with a threshold of 0.7. These thresholds on the median values may seem rather low, but let us remember that all the acquisition durations are taken into account, even the shortest ones.   shows the median values of the scores for each set of 322 functional networks estimations corresponding to combinations between seeds and references. The two thresholds lead to an almost identical choice for the selection of combinations. All seeds have their best scores with the expected reference, and each of the six functional networks are considered to be sufficiently well-detected with SBA for Jaccard's index in accordance with our selection rules. The AUC suggests as good enough one more seed for cerebellum but considers that salience is not detected well-enough with our set of seeds. \n  \nColor maps of median values of Jaccard's indices and AUC for all combinations of seeds and MSDL references. Green circles show where seeds are considered to provide successful detection with respect to our thresholding rules (0.1 for the Jaccard median and 0.7 for the AUC median). The first column of Jaccard's index median values corresponds to the boxplots shown in  , which showed distribution of Jaccard's index for every seeds in combination with the MSDL DMN reference. The color code used for the seed here is the same as in the boxplots. \n  \n shows the range of durations where scores are not significantly different from their maximum values (5% risk) for each selected reference/seed combination. Each line corresponds to a LOESS curve computed for one score (Jaccard's index/AUC) and one combination between seed and reference network (322 functional networks estimation per combination). The colors on the heatmap are scaled between minimum and maximum values of the corresponding score and matches with the stages already described for DMN in the previous section. Indeed, for every combination between seeds and references, both scores rapidly increase, and start to stabilize after a certain duration. However, for both measures, the 95% confidence interval around the maximum suggests a later start in the stabilization than suggested directly by the LOESS curve values. While some combinations scores look already stabilized at 12 min, almost all of them are close to their maximum value at 16 min.   shows a collection of functional areas obtained at a duration of 14 min. While the language seed struggles to detect spatial components far from the seeds, all the other ones provide good detection of expected functional networks. The two bottom rows show the same subjects and the same reference with different seeds. \n  \nColor maps of Jaccard's Index and AUC LOESS curve value with respect to the acquisition duration for all selected reference/seed combination. Each line corresponds to the computation of one LOESS curve on a subset of 322 functional networks estimations, these subsets of estimations corresponding to a selected seed. Every combination has a rapidly increasing score followed by a stabilization stage. The PPV peak shows on all combinations around 9 min and appears always just before score start stabilizing. Maximum and its 95% confidence interval may be unstable since score variations are often low after PPV peak. \n    \nCollection of estimated functional networks at 14 min with the corresponding scores: Jaccard's Index, Area Under the Curve, Sensitivity, and PPV. The two bottom rows show the same subjects and the same reference but with different seeds. The third row shows the estimated (blue) and reference (red) visual network for the same subject (subject 7) but different seeds (\u201cdorsal left\u201d seed on the left and \u201cdorsal right\u201d seed on the right). Similarly, the bottom row shows the same subject (subject 1) with different seeds (\u201cPrefrontal\u201d and \u201cPosterior\u201d). \n  \n\n\n## 5. Discussion \n  \nOur two objectives were to confirm the feasibility of resting state ASL and to evaluate the influence of the acquisition duration on the estimation of functional areas.  ,   with corresponding scores in   and in   confirm that, even with a classic sequence, and the basic preprocessing and modeling we used, ASL is fully viable as a resting-state method. Regarding the impact of acquisition duration, the most important result is the stabilization of the functional areas estimation after a certain duration for both measures, Jaccard's index and AUC, with a strong inter-subjects correlation (i.e., not a mean-effect induced by the LOESS modeling). Since the acquisition should have the shortest duration possible for clinical implementation, the recommended duration eventually corresponds to the start of the stabilization stage. Stricter definitions of the stabilization stage would lead to longer duration since they would heavily rely on the LOESS curve maximum by considering as stable just a narrow interval around the maximum. However, since after 12\u201314 min the score variations are low, a slight change in preprocessing or in the population could also lead to an unstable maximum without changing the trend. Relaxed definitions would keep recommended duration stability, but they may consider a functional area as good enough when a human investigator would not. Actually, early stages of acquisition are associated with poor representation of functional areas not in the same connected component that the seed, as we saw with  ,  . Based on our different results, 14 min seems to be an interesting compromise between shortest duration and best estimation of functional networks. \n\nRegarding the rs-BOLD, others studies have suggested different values for duration/number of volumes: 6 min/72 vol. (Van Dijk et al.,  ), 10 min/250 vol. (Bouix et al.,  ), 12 min/275 vol. (Birn et al.,  ), 25 min/750 vol. (Anderson et al.,  ), and 100 min/2,700 vol. (Laumann et al.,  ). In Termenon et al. ( ), Termenon et al. give as reliable configuration from 14 min/1,200 vol. for 40 subjects to 7 min/580 vol. for 100 subjects. Each paper assesses the effect of acquisition duration in rsBOLD differently: comparison to networks obtained from the longest acquisition (Bouix et al.,  ), connectivity between regions of interest (Birn et al.,  ), reproducibility (Anderson et al.,  ; Laumann et al.,  ), and scoring on graph properties (Termenon et al.,  ). Hence, because of the different modeling, it is hard to say where our rs-ASL suggestion would be placed compared to the different rs-BOLD results, notwithstanding the different sequence and preprocessing. The different quality assessments are not a drawback however, as each work explores different aspects of the impact of the acquisition duration/number of volumes. A natural area of future investigations would be to compare rs-ASL performance to rs-BOLD with the inclusion of acquisition duration/number of volumes as a parameter. Furthermore, as we wanted to also confirm the efficiency of ASL in resting-state fMRI, we naturally focused on a subject scale study and functional networks estimation, but, as rs-BOLD literature shows, numerous aspects of the effect of acquisition duration are yet to be explored. \n\nIn order to estimate functional networks, the two most common methods are SBA and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). As ICA is also widely used in rs-fMRI, an investigation of the functional network's spatial stabilization in rs-ASL using the definition of functional connectivity through statistical independence should be beneficial. Indeed, it is not totally guaranteed that statistical independence and linear correlation (or any other alternative modeling of functional connectivity) provide a similar stabilization phenomenon, even if SBA and ICA eventually provide similar functional networks (Cole et al.,  ; Joel et al.,  ). \n\nNote that the DMN, the sensori-motor cortex, and the cerebellum have an almost consensual spatial definition among the authors, unlike language, visual and salience, which show a greater spatial variability (see for example  ). As we provide an evaluation only with one set of references (from the MSDL), this could be a limitation of our work and could call into question the score values we obtained. However, the spatial variability of the areas of interest in atlases is low enough to change only the scores but not the trend observed in this paper. Indeed, overlap scores can be interpreted as distances, and, in that sense, we measured the distance between functional networks estimation and fixed points (the set of references). Changing the set of references modifies scores values but not the stabilization phenomenon, as the references are still fixed. Score values were used for seeds validation by thresholding overlap scores with MSDL references. After considering only the successful seeds, the score values matter less than their stabilization after a certain acquisition duration. Regarding the score values, using a ground truth built from subjects would most likely bias the scores toward higher values but could also question the validity of such ground truth, where confidence in atlases is much stronger. Niazy et al. ( ), Zhu et al. ( ) report that a S\u00f8rensen-Dice score of 0.3 corresponds to a good overlap, regarding the reproducibility of functional networks between rs-ASL and rs-BOLD (i.e., with ground-truth built from same set of subjects). As a S\u00f8rensen-Dice score of 0.3 corresponds to a Jaccard's index of 0.176 , and our subjects are independent from the MSDL BOLD atlas, the median values of Jaccard's indices we obtained in  ,  , or the values we obtained in  ,  , confirm   a posteriori   the criteria for seeds selection, and   a fortiori  , rs-ASL's ability to provide good estimation of functional networks. \n\nPreprocessing influence should also be considered as positive: since we use typical and basic preprocessing, more advanced techniques should foster functional networks estimation, and therefore, provide the same or an earlier stabilization, still keeping our suggestion as a sufficient duration. The same is true for ASL readout approach. Using a 3D readout is probably an improvement in our sequence, as it tends to have higher SNR compared to 2D EPI, but not every investigator has access to 3D sequences (Alsop et al.,  ). Not to mention readout approach, ASL is very sensitive to changes in its parameters. Since we are studying the influence of acquisition duration for a given set of parameters, the suggested sufficient duration of 14 min for rs-ASL could be strongly influenced by the sequence parameters. Although the influence of each of them is to be kept in mind, most of them should not disturb the investigators, as most of them have a specific bibliography that goes well-beyond the issue of the acquisition duration. However, two sequence parameters may have a deep impact on our results: post-labeling delay (PLD) and repetition time (TR). For the PLD, the 1,250 ms duration we used for the first slice corresponds to 1712.5 ms at the median slice. Shorter PLD, like 600 ms, seems to give a better functional estimation (Viviani et al.,  ; Liang et al.,  ,  ). We kept the PLD quite long, close to the 1,800 ms at the median slice, which is recommended for best estimation of CBF (Alsop et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ). Indeed, the main advantage of ASL is ultimately to compute CBF, although we focused on functional areas estimation in this paper. The critical parameter in our opinion is repetition time. It defines the sample frequency of the resting-state signal and turns our 14 min suggestion into 240 volumes since we only work numerically on the signal. Its variation may shift the stabilization step toward a higher/lower number of volumes and hence a longest/shortest duration, without changing the stabilization of the functional networks estimation after a certain number of volumes (i.e., same signal but different sampling frequency). Moreover in rs-ASL, TR values are typically between 3 and 5 s, which is too wide to assume the locally linear dependence between TR and optimal duration. As a pioneer work on the effect of acquisition duration in rs-ASL, we focused more on the modeling rather than investigating the influence of the TR. In rsBOLD, the TR has already been shown to be able to impact estimation considering a fixed number of volumes (Wu et al.,  ), but for rs-ASL a specific investigation of TR in combination with the number of volumes would be highly valuable. \n\n\n## 6. Conclusion \n  \nUsual sequence, preprocessing, and SBA managed to reconstruct the six typical functional networks of interest at the subject scale, which confirms the feasibility of ASL as a rsfMRI technique. The main objective was to find the amount of data to acquire in rs-ASL to properly estimate functional networks, considering that clinical implementation requires the shortest possible duration. Our results show that functional networks estimations stabilize after a certain number of volumes/duration. For our set of sequence parameters, we suggest 240 volumes/14 min to achieve an overall stabilization. Any method that improves the detection of functional networks is likely to provide an earlier stabilization start, i.e., a lower number for volume/duration. Hence, since we use a basic and typical sequence, preprocessing and estimation, 240 volumes/14 min should be enough for most rs-ASL usage. Last, the exploration of the impact of the TR and PLD in combination with acquisition duration was beyond the scope of this article but would be highly beneficial for sequence implementation since we forecast them to be the two parameters that may shift the stabilization start toward higher number of volumes. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nIn accordance with the consent form signed by the subjects, authors are not allowed to share MRI acquisitions.

More recent evidence in primates and adult humans suggests a modality-specific stratification of the prefrontal cortex. The current study therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neuronal correlates of proactive (following cues) and reactive (following probes) cognitive control for simultaneous audio-visual stimulation in 67 healthy adolescents (13\u201318 years old). Behavioral results were only partially supportive of visual dominance in adolescents, with both reduced response times and accuracy during attend-visual relative to attend-auditory trials. Differential activation of medial and lateral prefrontal cortex for processing incongruent relative to congruent stimuli (reactive control) was also only observed during attend-visual trials. There was no evidence of modality-specific prefrontal cortex stratification during the active processing of multisensory stimuli or during separate functional connectivity analyses. Attention-related modulations were also greater within visual relative to auditory cortex, but were less robust than observed in previous adult studies. Collectively, current results suggest a continued transition towards visual dominance in adolescence, as well as limited modality-specific specialization of prefrontal cortex and attentional modulations of unisensory cortex. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCognitive control plays a fundamental role in continuously and flexibly adapting to changing environments ( ). The development of cognitive control reflects the continued refinement of an existing set of functions rather than the emergence of a new ability ( ), and is therefore crucial to other cognitive domains (e.g., working memory, attention, and decision making;  ). To date, most developmental studies of cognitive control have used unisensory stimuli, which may not be reflective of the complex environmental multisensory demands encountered outside experimental settings. \n\nAccording to the dual-mechanism framework, cognitive control operates via two distinct modes of proactive and reactive control ( ;  ), with reactive control maturing more rapidly from a developmental perspective ( ). Specifically, reactive control, or corrective actions to emergent and competing sensory or motor representations, is employed more frequently by younger children and older adults ( ). In contrast, proactive control requires an individual to maintain goal-relevant information over sustained periods following an external or internal cue ( ;  ). It is believed to be mediated primarily by the sustained/increased activity of the cognitive control network (CCN). Proactive control is theorized to require additional metabolic resources (e.g., for glucose consumption, waste removal, neurotransmitter recycling), and places increased demands on working memory ( ,  ). Behavioral studies suggest that reliance on proactive or reactive cognitive control strategies changes from late childhood to early adulthood ( ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ), but the timing of the transition has not been well-defined. \n\nIn a multisensory environment, attention must sometimes be directed to a single sensory modality, which results in attention-related modulations (ARMs) within unisensory cortices ( ;  ;  ). Auditory and visual cortex both show increased neuronal responses (i.e., up-regulation) when attention is focused on the respective sensory modality. A decreased neuronal response, posited to be indicative of inhibition, has also been observed within unisensory cortical areas corresponding to the unattended stimulus ( ). ARMs are believed to result from top-down feedback from the CCN, or potentially through direct innervation between unisensory cortex ( ;  ;  ). \n\nSensory dominance depends on task context (Modality Appropriateness Hypothesis;  ), perceived reliability of information, and stage of processing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, visual information dominates during most multisensory situations in adults with the exception of temporal processing (Visual Dominance theory or the Colavita effect;  ), with increased involvement of cortical regions when top-down attention is shifted away from visual streams ( ). In contrast, a recent meta-analysis concluded that the Colavita effect is absent in childhood ( ). Additional behavioral studies suggest that infants and young children are biased towards auditory stimuli until approximately six to nine years of age, with the consolidation of visual dominance occurring in early adolescence ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, the majority of these studies only included youths up to age 12, with a notable absence of work conducted during adolescence. \n\nIt was traditionally assumed that there were different networks for attention to visual (dorsal frontoparietal cortex) relative to auditory (frontotemporal cortex) stimuli across major brain lobules ( ,  ), but that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) served in a supramodal capacity ( ;  ,  ;  , ). However, non-human primate data ( ;  ) and emerging evidence from adults ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ) suggest that activity in the lateral PFC may also be stratified dependent on the sensory modality during multisensory stimulation. Multisensory studies conducted in adult samples have reported the existence of interdigitating auditory and visual areas within lateral PFC that are stratified in a ventral-dorsal ( ;  ) or a rostral-caudal gradient ( ). However, whether these sensory-selective regions within the PFC are already present in adolescence or develop in early adulthood has yet to be determined. \n\nThe current study therefore extends prior work on multisensory cognitive control in adults ( ) to adolescents, purposefully altering the paradigm design to disambiguate neural activity in response to cues (theoretically measuring proactive control) and probes (theoretically measuring reactive control). Based on previous results ( ), it was hypothesized that the rostral lateral PFC would be specialized for auditory input, while the medial and caudal lateral PFC would demonstrate a preferential activation for visual input, yet also function in more of a supramodal capacity. Similarly, only the rostral lateral PFC was expected to exhibit modality-specific functional connectivity effects with auditory cortex ( ). We also predicted that ARMs would be more evident within the visual rather than auditory cortex, with increased activity within the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) observed for incongruent relative to congruent trials ( ;  ). \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA jackknife analyses conducted in our healthy adult sample ( ) indicated that a minimum of 55 participants was required to reliably detect PFC stratification during multisensory tasks. Seventy-four healthy adolescents (13\u201318 years) were therefore included in the current study, with recruitment occurring from the local community using flyers and word of mouth. Exclusion criteria for the participants included 1) a history of a) neurological diagnosis, b) previous traumatic brain injury with >5 min loss of consciousness, c) developmental disorder (autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability), d) any psychiatric disorders other than adjustment disorder, e) attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder, f) learning disorder, 2) non-fluency in English, or 3) substance abuse/dependence. To confirm drug abstinence, urine-based drug screens were conducted for all participants. Informed consent and assent, according to institutional guidelines at the University Of New Mexico School of Medicine, was provided by the parent or by the participants themselves if they were 18 years old. \n\nData acquisition errors occurred for three participants and an abnormal finding was present on the radiological report for one participant, resulting in study exclusion. One participant demonstrated extreme voxelwise activation (i.e., 3 standard deviations above the mean) in >5 % of voxels across all task conditions relative to the remainder of the sample and was removed prior to analyses. Two participants were excluded for poor accuracy (<64 % on two or more conditions) based on a binomial distribution. No participants were excluded as reaction time outliers (>3*interquartile range), nor were any participants excluded as motion outliers (mean framewise displacement [FD] >3*interquartile range). The final sample for task-based analyses therefore included 67 participants (31 females; 61 right-handed; mean age = 15.60 \u00b1 1.68 years). FreeSurfer segmentation of the brain failed for one participant, resulting in a reduced sample for connectivity analyses (N = 66). \n\n\n### fMRI task paradigm \n  \nThe current task was similar to previous studies ( ) with a few key modifications. Briefly, a multisensory cue (audiovisual; 300 ms duration) was presented at the beginning of each block ( A and B) to determine the modality for selective attention (\u201cHEAR\u201d = attend-auditory; \u201cLOOK\u201d = attend-visual) or for the planned inhibition of upcoming motor responses (\u201cNONE\u201d = proactive response inhibition). The participants were instructed to withhold their response following the \u201cNONE\u201d cues. The NONE trials were modeled separately from the attend-auditory and attend-visual conditions at the single-subject level, but were not included in group-level analyses in the current study. Data on \u201cNONE\u201d trials in a subset of participants has been reported in a previous publication ( ).   \nDiagrammatic representation of the task and behavioral results. Participants attended to target stimuli (numbers: one, two, or three) in either the visual (attend-visual: AV; Panel A) or auditory (attend-auditory: AA; Panel B) modality while ignoring incongruent (Inc) or congruent (Cong) distractor stimuli in the opposite modality. Each trial was separated into distinct cue (multisensory cue words \u201cHEAR\u201d or \u201cLOOK\u201d; orange colored boxes) and target (written Arabic numbers; green colored boxes) phases with corresponding hemodynamic response functions. This was accomplished by having variable inter-phase intervals (IPI ) between the cue and the first numeric target, as well as variable inter-block intervals (IBI   ; black colored box). The inter-stimulus interval (ISI ) between numeric targets within each block was fixed. Correct responses (CR) are indicated on the right side of panels. Box-and-scatter plots (Panel C) depict median reaction times (RT) and accuracy for both AV and AA conditions for congruent (un-notched boxes) and incongruent (notched boxes) trials. \n  Fig. 1   \n\nFor attend-auditory and attend-visual conditions, the multisensory probes were either congruent (i.e., matching auditory/visual number) or incongruent (i.e., different auditory/visual number). In contrast to previous studies, a variable (2,460\u22123,380 ms) delay separated the presentation of multisensory numeric probes (words = \u201cONE\u201d, \u201cTWO\u201d, or \u201cTHREE\u201d; 300 ms duration) from cues. Therefore, the hemodynamic response function (HRF) could be individually and separately modeled for both the cue (theoretical proactive control) and probe (theoretical reactive control) phase. Probes occurred at a frequency of 0.66 Hz (6 trials per each 7.8 s block). Participants completed 7 blocks of each of the 5 conditions (i.e., none incongruent, attend-visual congruent, attend-visual incongruent, attend-auditory congruent, attend-auditory incongruent) for a total of 42 trials of each condition. Inter-block intervals were also jittered (3,700\u22125,540 ms) to decrease temporal expectations and minimize the non-linear summing of HRFs across cues and probes ( ). The task design resulted in a non-singular/invertible matrix with only moderate collinearity. \n\nParticipants responded with a right-handed button press to one of three buttons corresponding to the target stimulus in the attended modality (probe modality) while ignoring simultaneously presented numbers in the opposite sensory modality. All multisensory stimuli were presented foveally and binaurally via headphones (head-centered). Participants were asked to maintain constant head and eye positioning (visual fixation on a centrally presented cross). All participants practiced the task outside of the MRI before the scan (one block of each condition, 6 trials per block; multiple practices possible). For the resting-state scan, participants were instructed to stare at a centrally presented white fixation cross on a black background for approximately 5 min. \n\nResponse time and accuracy data were modeled with either normal or gamma distributions as appropriate using 2 \u00d7 2 [Modality (Attend-auditory vs. Attend-visual) \u00d7 Congruency (Congruent vs. Incongruent)] generalized estimating equations. Omnibus analyses were Bonferroni-corrected based on the number of comparisons (i.e., reaction time and accuracy; 0.05/2 = 0.025). \n\n\n### MR imaging \n  \nMRI data were collected on a 3 T Siemens Tim Trio scanner with a 32-channel head coil. Data collection included a high-resolution MPRAGE T -weighted (1.0 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 mm) sequence, T -weighted (1.1 \u00d7 1.1 \u00d7 1.5 mm) sequence, susceptibility-weighted images (1.0 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 1.5 mm), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (0.8 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 3.0 mm). Collected images were reviewed by a blinded, board-certified radiologist. Task (2 runs) and connectivity (1 run) data were acquired utilizing a single-shot, gradient-echo echoplanar pulse sequence with 56 interleaved slices acquired for whole-brain coverage (3.02 \u00d7 3.02 \u00d7 3.00 mm) using multiband imaging to achieve high temporal sampling (TR = 460 ms) of the HRF. Initial images from task and resting-state runs were excluded to account for T  equilibrium effects based on default calculations for multiband CMRR sequences, leaving 1,212 and 649 images, respectively. A reference image (multiband factor = 1) was also acquired to facilitate registration to T -weighted data. Two spin-echo field mapping sequences (3.02 \u00d7 3.02 \u00d7 3.00 mm) with reversed-phase encoding directions (A\u2192P; P\u2192A) were generated to correct for susceptibility-related distortion. \n\n\n### Image processing and statistical analyses \n  \nTask and resting-state data were assessed for anomalous values and replaced using AFNI\u2019s despiking tool ( ). Images were then temporally interpolated to the first slice and spatially registered to a reference image in two- and three-dimensional space using AFNI software suite tools to reduce the effects of head motion. Images were corrected for susceptibility distortions using FSL\u2019s Topup algorithm ( ;  ), converted to standard stereotaxic space ( ) using a non-linear transformation (AFNI 3dQwarp) and spatially blurred (6-mm Gaussian filter). For task data, finite impulse response deconvolution was used to generate a single HRF individually for cue (14.26 s post-cue onset) and probe (20.70 s post-probe onset) phases. Nuisance regressors included 6 motion parameters (3 rotational and 3 translational) and their derivatives, error trials, and a second-order polynomial to reduce hardware-related artifacts ( ). Resulting beta coefficients were then separately summed within individual HRF periods to obtain estimates of peak (2.30\u20135.98 s) and inhibitory (6.90\u201311.04 s) activity during the theoretical proactive cue phase. Beta coefficients were only summed within the probe HRF to obtain an estimate of peak (3.68\u201312.88 s) activity during theoretical reactive control conditions. These time windows were selected prior to analyses based on averaged (all participants across all trials) HRF data from motor, sensory, and PFC to avoid bias. \n\nResting-state functional connectivity maps were calculated by regressing motion parameters and their first-order derivatives, as well as the estimates of physiological noise from white matter and cerebral spinal fluid, followed by the application of a bandpass filter (0.01\u22120.1 Hz) to the data. Seed-based regions of interest (ROIs) for connectivity maps were defined within FreeSurfer (Version 5.3.0) using the Desikan-Killiany atlas ( ) for primary/secondary auditory and visual cortices (see Supplementary Materials for further details). Consistent with previous studies ( ), additional connectivity analyses were also conducted on empirically-derived seeds for those unisensory cortical regions that exhibited high activation in response to the relevant auditory and visual probes to verify results from the Desikan-Killiany atlas-based labels (see Supplementary Fig. S1 for a comparison of findings). \n\nTwo whole-brain one-way (Auditory cues vs. Visual cues) ANCOVAs with mean FD as a covariate examined for differences during peak and inhibitory cue phases. In addition, whole-brain 2 \u00d7 2 [Modality (Auditory cues vs. Visual cues) \u00d7 Congruency (Congruent vs. Incongruent)] ANCOVAs with mean FD as a covariate examined differences in modality-specific activity during the probe phase. All whole-brain results within each modality were corrected for family-wise error using statistical (  p   < 0.001) and minimum volume thresholds (task-based analyses: 575 \u03bcL; connectivity analyses: 1067 \u03bcL) based on 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations and spherical autocorrelation estimates ( ). All analyses were performed with and without age as a covariate in the model. As functional results were nearly identical, the more parsimonious model is presented in main results, whereas age covariate results are presented in Supplemental materials. The size of activated areas is reported in \u03bcL (1 native voxel = 27 \u03bcL). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral data \n  \nResults are presented in  C. The analysis for reaction time indicated a main effect of modality (Wald-\u03c7  = 79.82;   p   < 0.001), with a longer response time for attend-auditory (599.98\u00b179.45 ms; data presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation) relative to attend-visual trials (560.12\u00b166.22 ms). Further, a main effect of congruency was observed (Wald-\u03c7  = 135.30;   p   < 0.001), with a longer response time for incongruent (610.52\u00b173.26 ms) relative to congruent trials (549.58\u00b173.91 ms). The Modality \u00d7 Congruency interaction was not significant (Wald\u2010\u03c7  = 2.65;   p   = 0.10). \n\nThe analysis for accuracy indicated a significant Modality \u00d7 Congruency interaction (Wald\u2010\u03c7  = 30.21;   p   < 0.001). For the congruent condition, accuracy on the attend-visual trials (94.64\u00b13.19 %) was significantly higher relative to the attend-auditory trials (91.08\u00b13.19 %), whereas for the incongruent condition accuracy was significantly higher on the attend-auditory trials (87.51\u00b17.45 %) relative to attend-visual trials (83.49\u00b18.58 %). \n\n\n### Functional task results \n  \n#### Activity during cues \n  \nResults from whole-brain one-way ANCOVAs (attend-auditory cues vs. attend-visual cues) with mean FD as a covariate indicated increased activity during the peak phase in the right dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and right temporal pole, as well as aspects of the dorsal and ventral processing stream including the right middle/superior temporal gyrus (MTG/STG) and right precuneus extending to right superior occipital gyrus for attend-visual cues ( A and B;  ). During the inhibitory phase ( C and D), decreased activity (i.e., below baseline) was observed for attend-auditory cues in the right ventromedial PFC, as well as in the bilateral anterior and middle cingulate cortex.   \nCue-related activity and percent signal change (PSC) in selected regions of interest (ROI). During the peak phase (Panel A), increased activation (blue: p < .001; cyan: p < .0001) within the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), temporal pole (Temp), middle and superior temporal gyrus (MTG/STG), and precuneus (PCUN) was observed for the attend-visual (AV) relative to attend-auditory (AA) cues. During the inhibitory phase (Panel C), greater deactivation was observed for AA cues (blue: p < 0.001; cyan: p < 0.0001) within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), anterior (ACC) and middle (MCC) cingulate cortex relative to baseline. Locations of the sagittal (X) slices are given according to the Talairach atlas. Panels B and D (R = right; B = bilateral) display box-and-scatter plots of the PSC (blue: AV; red: AA). \n  Fig. 2     \nMain effect of modality during cue phase of the multisensory cognitive control task. \n  Table 1     \n\n\n#### Activity during probes \n  \nA 2 \u00d7 2 whole-brain ANCOVA (Modality [Attend-auditory vs. Attend-visual] \u00d7 Congruency [Congruent vs Incongruent]) with mean FD as a covariate indicated several regions exhibiting a Modality \u00d7 Congruency interaction that followed three general patterns ( ;  A). First, greater activation for the incongruent relative to congruent condition for attend-visual trials, with no difference during the attend-auditory trials within the left DLPFC, bilateral pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), right and left anterior insular cortex/ventrolateral PFC, left MTG/STG, right and left fusiform gyrus, and bilateral thalamus ( B). Second, a greater deactivation ( C) was observed in the congruent condition during the attend-visual trials, with no difference during attend-auditory trials within the bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), and the left STG extending to the pSTS (evidence of ARMs). In the third pattern, opposing patterns of activity were observed for attend-visual and attend-auditory trials within the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, right MTG extending into the internal capsule, and right primary sensorimotor cortex ( D). Similarly, the bilateral caudate, the left middle frontal gyrus extending into anterior corona radiata, and the right and left associative visual cortex (evidence of ARMs) exhibited opposing patterns of activation and deactivation as a function of attended modality.   \nModality x Congruency interaction during probe phase of the multisensory cognitive control task. \n  Table 2       \nModality \u00d7 Congruency interaction and percent signal change (PSC) during probe-related activity in selected regions of interest (ROI). Regions that exhibited a significant Modality \u00d7 Congruency interaction (red: p < 0.001; yellow: p < 0.0001) are depicted in Panel A. Locations of the sagittal (X) and axial (Z) slices are given according to the Talairach atlas. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), pre-supplementary motor area (Pre-SMA), anterior insular cortex/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (AIC/VLPFC) and middle/superior temporal gyrus (MTG/STG) and bilateral thalamus (Thal) showed greater activation for the incongruent (Inc; notched boxes) relative to congruent (Cong; un-notched boxes) condition during attend-visual (AV) trials. Box-and-scatter plots of the PSC from selected ROI (R = right; L = left; B = bilateral) are depicted in Panel B. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the STG/posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) showed deactivation relative to baseline during AV but not attend-auditory (AA) trials during the congruent condition (box-and-scatter plots in Panel C). Patterns of opposing activity (i.e., greater activation/deactivation for the incongruent and congruent conditions as a function of attended modality; Panel D) were observed within the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), MTG, caudate (Caud) and associative visual cortex (AVC). \n  Fig. 3   \n\nThe main effect of modality ( ; Supplemental Fig. S2) was significant within the right anterior STG extending into the right parahippocampal gyrus (0 > attend-visual > attend-auditory) and the left secondary visual cortex (attend-visual > attend-auditory > 0).   \nMain effect of modality during probe phase of the multisensory cognitive control task. \n  Table 3     \n\nIncreased activation was observed on incongruent relative to congruent trials ( A and B) within the right and left premotor cortex, right pSTS, left inferior/superior parietal lobule, right primary visual cortex, right and left dorsal striatum, brainstem extending into the cerebellar peduncles, bilateral cerebellar lobules I\u2013VI and the vermis of lobule VI, right and left lobules VI/VIIa, and right and left lobules VIIb/VIIIa/VIIIb. A separate cluster of increased activation during the congruent relative to incongruent condition was also observed in left lobule VIIa of the cerebellum. Further, several areas including the default mode network presented a main effect of congruency, with increased deactivation in the incongruent relative to congruent condition ( ;  A and C). These areas included the right and left ventromedial PFC and superior PFC extending to the right DLPFC, right orbitofrontal cortex, right MTG, bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, right cuneus/precuneus, and the right and left angular gyrus. In contrast, the right superior parietal lobule exhibited increased deactivation for congruent relative to incongruent trials   \nMain effect of congruency and percent signal change (PSC) during probe-related activity in selected regions of interest (ROI).

Panels B displays box-and-scatter plots of the PSC from in selected ROIs (right = R; left = L; bilateral = B) showing increased activation for incongruent (Inc: notched boxes) relative to congruent (Cong: un-notched boxes) trials (Panel A warm colors: red p < 0.001; yellow p < 0.0001) within the premotor cortex (PMot), inferior/superior parietal lobule (IPL/SPL), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and posterior STS (pSTS), dorsal striatum (dStriatum), primary visual cortex (V1), and cerebellar Lobules VI/VIIa (LVI/VIIa) and VIIb/VIII (LVIIb/VIII). Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and angular gyrus (AG) showed greater deactivation (Panel A cold colors: blue p < 0.001; cyan p < 0.0001) during incongruent trials, and are depicted in Panel C with box-and-scatter plots. \n  Fig. 4     \nMain effect of congruency during probe phase of the multisensory cognitive control task. \n  Table 4     \n\n\n\n### Connectivity analysis \n  \nThe connectivity analysis (N = 66) examined whether certain voxelwise regions of the brain would demonstrate a resting-state connectivity bias with atlas-derived primary/secondary auditory or visual seed ROI, consistent with the modality-specific biases (attend-visual > attend-auditory or attend-auditory > attend-visual) that were observed during the probe phase of the multisensory task. Specifically, paired-samples t-tests evaluated whether whole-brain voxelwise connectivity was greater with auditory or visual atlas seeds (See Supplementary Fig. S1). Regions that exhibited both significant auditory or visual seed functional connectivity bias and a significant effect of modality from task analyses were determined by implementing an additional small-volume overlap correction (2 native voxels; 54 \u03bcL) on both modality (i.e., task-based) and connectivity maps. \n\nResults indicated that both areas showing an effect of modality during probe analysis, the right anterior STG extending into the right parahippocampal gyrus (BAs 13/34/38/47; 626 \u03bcL) and left secondary visual cortex (BAs 17/18; 1207 \u03bcL), overlapped significantly with areas displaying connectivity differences between unisensory cortices. Of particular note, these results were complementary (i.e., greater visual seed connectivity where activation was greater to attend-auditory stimuli, greater auditory seed connectivity where activation was greater to attend-visual stimuli). \n\nIn addition to overlapping areas, the connectivity analysis showed widespread differences in connectivity between unisensory seeds (Supplementary Fig. S1). The pre-motor cortex and much of the posterior parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and cerebellum displayed greater connectivity to the visual cortex seed than to the auditory cortex seed. Conversely, the dorsomedial PFC and the dorsal anterior/middle cingulate gyrus, the insula, and a large portion of the temporal lobe displayed greater auditory cortex seed connectivity. These results were replicated when using unisensory cortex seeds derived from ARMs contrast maps rather than atlas-based seeds (see Supplemental Fig. S1). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current study theoretically examined proactive and reactive multisensory cognitive control in adolescents by adapting a previously used task to disambiguate cue and probe-related activity ( ). Contrary to our hypothesis and previous work in adults ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ), modality-specific stratification of the PFC was not observed when directing attention to either visual or auditory stimuli during multisensory presentation. Instead, several of the CCN nodes (left DLPFC, bilateral pre-SMA, bilateral anterior insular cortex/ventrolateral PFC, bilateral ACC) and the left STG/pSTS exhibited modality-specific activation for incongruent relative to congruent trials during attend-visual trials only. The remainder of the CCN and the right pSTS demonstrated increased activity during incongruent trials as predicted. Finally, ARMs were observed within the visual cortex during reactive cognitive control following probes, but were absent within unisensory cortex during more proactive phases of cognitive control following cues. \n\nAs expected, response times were faster for congruent relative to incongruent trials, along with robust activation of several traditional nodes of the CCN including posterior parietal cortex and dorsal striatum, as well as the cerebellum ( ;  ). Although medial and lateral PFC were further modulated by the modality for focused attention, these results suggest that the reactive CCN is fully developed in adolescents ( ). Previous findings ( ) of increased involvement of the pSTS during multisensory reactive cognitive control in an adult sample were also replicated in adolescents. The pSTS is located between the auditory and ventral visual streams, and traditionally has been associated with the integration of information across these two sensory modalities ( ;  ). However, differentiation of activation based on stimulus characteristics (e.g., congruent vs. incongruent) suggests a higher-order attentional role for the pSTS during multisensory processing. \n\nAs previously described, recent studies have suggested that the PFC is activated in both a supramodal ( , ) or modality-specific ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ) fashion. In contrast, the PFC in the current adolescent sample did not exhibit evidence of stratification based on sensory modality during either the theoretical proactive or reactive multisensory cognitive control aspects of the task. Similarly, connectivity analyses did not provide support for either a rostral lateral PFC connectivity with the auditory cortex ( ) or a dorsal-to-ventral PFC gradient with unisensory cortex ( ;  ). Instead, current findings indicated that the lateral (left DLPFC, ventrolateral PFC) and medial (pre-SMA/ACC) PFC showed greater evidence of reactive control only during the attend-visual condition (Modality \u00d7 Congruency interaction). \n\nThe interaction in prefrontal cortical areas may be explained by more protracted neurodevelopmental changes that occur in the neural recruitment of the PFC ( ;  ), and potentially reflects a continued transitional bias away from favoring auditory stimuli from earlier developmental periods. Behavioral performance was also mixed in terms of sensory dominance. Specifically, adolescents displayed a greater bias toward visual relative to auditory stimuli during reactive cognitive control as evidenced by faster overall reaction times and increased accuracy on congruent trials. Higher accuracy was observed for incongruent attend-auditory trials, suggesting a strong influence of auditory distractors while processing visual probes. Collectively, current behavioral and functional findings do not fully support the consolidation of visual dominance in adolescents aged 13\u201318 years old during multisensory processing ( ;  ;  , ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nDiscrepancies in PFC stratification between current and past findings might also be due to methodological differences in task design. Specifically, the interval between the start of the cue and start of probes was intentionally increased (greater than 2500 ms) and made to be a variable rather than fixed interval (1000 ms) as used in previous studies ( ). This change in experimental design permitted the individual modeling of HRFs for cues and probes, which theoretically disambiguates the neural substrates of proactive (cue-related activity) and reactive (probe-related activity) control. However, neither stratification of the PFC nor anticipatory modulation of unisensory cortex (ARMs) was observed during the cue phase. Instead, increased activation was observed within the right DLPFC, temporal pole, MTG/STG and precuneus following visual relative to auditory cues, along with increased deactivation of the anterior default mode network during the attend-auditory trials for periods in which the HRF is typically associated with inhibition ( ). \n\nImportantly, previous research also suggests that different experimental manipulations can contribute to the weighting of proactive versus reactive control processes ( ;  ;  ). For example, shortening the delay between cue and probe reduces age-related differences in performance on the AX-CPT task ( ). As such, longer inter-stimulus intervals utilized in the current experiment may have also influenced how individuals utilize cue information and the recruitment of the lateral PFC. Moreover, the cue did not provide any information about upcoming probe status (i.e., congruent or incongruent stimuli), which may have limited its overall utility and further reduced proactive use. In addition, the current design did not collect reaction time data under differential conditions to verify that participants were in fact proactively using the cues, as is typically done with the AX-CPT and other control tasks ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nSimilar to previous findings ( ), ARMs were more evident in the visual cortex in the analysis of probes, showing evidence of both up-regulation during attend-visual trials (i.e., left secondary visual cortex) and increased deactivation during attend-auditory trials (i.e., left associative visual cortex). Increased deactivation of the left STG/pSTS was present during the attend-visual relative to attend-auditory trials, providing only minimal evidence of attentional modulations within auditory cortex. Both the unilateral presentation (left hemisphere only) and overall reduction in volume for visual and auditory cortical ARMs was unexpected in our adolescent sample. Previous studies have demonstrated differences in value-driven attentional capture ( ) and facial processing ( ) between adolescents and adults, with the latter study indicating increased modulation of task-relevant networks based on attentional demands for adults relative to greater emotional modulation for adolescents. Collectively, current and previous findings suggest that higher level attentional capabilities are not fully developed in adolescents. \n\nSeveral limitations of the current study should be noted. An older adolescent age group was included (13\u201318 years old), which precluded the study of earlier neurodevelopmental aspects of multisensory attention and cognitive control. Therefore, it is unclear whether current findings would apply to younger children, especially in response to cue-related activity as children tend to behave/respond more reactively ( ;  ). Future studies are needed to more fully explore developmental proactive-to-reactive shifts and sensory dominance across childhood to adulthood. Second, as previously discussed, the use of a different version of the multisensory task precludes disambiguation of whether discrepant results are due to variations in tasks used or secondary to developmental effects. \n\nCollectively, current behavioral and functional findings suggest a continued rather than a completed development towards visual dominance during adolescence. Modality-specific stratifications of the lateral PFC were also not observed, with only moderate evidence of ARMs in unisensory cortical regions. Given that this study is the first to investigate brain activation during multisensory cognitive control in adolescents, these findings will need to be replicated in independent samples and across the full neurodevelopmental spectrum. \n\n\n## Data statement \n  \nThe data that support the findings of this study will be openly available in FITBIR at   upon the conclusion of the study, reference number FITBIR-STUDY0000339. \n\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement \n  \n V.

To address this issue we enrolled 58 participants in an fMRI study in which participants were instructed to reappraise both negative and neutral stimuli. This design allowed us to separately study activations reflecting cognitive processes associated with reappraisal in general and activations specifically related to reappraisal of negative emotion. Our results confirmed that both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) contribute to emotion regulation through reappraisal. However, activity in the DLPFC was related to reappraisal independently of whether negative or neutral stimuli were reappraised, whereas the lateral OFC was uniquely related to reappraisal of negative stimuli. We suggest that relative to the lateral OFC, the DLPFC serves a more general role in emotion regulation, perhaps by reflecting the cognitive demand that is inherent to the regulation task. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe capacity to regulate the generation, experience and expression of emotion is a central aspect of mental health  . Indeed, emotion dysregulation is a common feature of psychiatric illness, and particularly of depressive and anxiety disorders  . The clinical implications of emotional regulation have promoted a growing interest in understanding the neural aspects of emotion regulation. Available data suggest that emotion regulation is accomplished through the interaction between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) \u2013 involved in control processes \u2013 and subcortical structures, such as the amygdala, involved in the generation of emotions  . \n\nInstruction-induced reappraisal of an emotionally salient stimulus is the most extensively studied form of cognitive emotion regulation. During reappraisal, cognitive strategies are used to reinterpret the meaning of an emotion-eliciting stimulus in terms of a non-emotional event thereby attenuating automatic emotional responses  . Neuroimaging studies of reappraisal collectively suggest that efforts to reappraise an emotional stimulus activate wide areas of the PFC, including ventrolateral, ventromedial, dorsolateral and dorsomedial regions  \u2013 . The variety of PFC regions implicated in these past studies is likely to reflect important differences in specific experimental manipulations  . The basic rationale underlying reappraisal paradigms is that the emotion regulatory processes can be isolated by subtracting the effect of prototypical attend trials, during which subjects passively view negative pictures, from reappraise trials when subjects engage in a cognitively demanding emotional regulation task  . However, the direct comparison between attend and reappraise trials does not allow for a differentiation of activations due to emotion regulation   per se   and activations reflecting the recruitment of networks that are shared between different cognitive regulation processes more generally. Although previous research confirms that such a general network of cognitive control   are likely to be important in emotion regulation, the question remains open whether there are regions in the brain that that are uniquely related to attempts at regulating negative emotion. In fact, consistent with the notion of a general cognitive control network  , previous studies of reappraisal commonly report activations of areas that are shared with those reported from studies of the cognitive control of other mental processes, such as memory and attention  \u2013 . Specifically, the consistent recruitment of DLPFC during reappraisal   may reflect a more general role of this area in maintaining and representing the attentional demands of the task   and in monitoring and manipulating information held in working memory  \u2013 . Because of the sparse connections between the DLPFC and the amygdala  , this region is likely to influence the amygdala indirectly by modulating activity in other regions, such as perceptual areas in the parietal/occipital cortex or the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which are directly connected to the amygdala  ,  . The lateral OFC is of particular interest, because it is critically involved in cognitive control functions, such as response inhibition and response selection  ,  , as well as in various forms of cognitive emotion regulation  \u2013  and in particular reappraisal  ,  ,  ,  . Moreover, previous studies on reappraisal of negative affect have reported reappraisal-dependent coupling between the lateral OFC and the amygdala  ,   and activity in the right lateral OFC has been identified as a core region mediating successful reappraisal of negative emotion  . \n\nAlthough there are other candidate regions with relevance for emotion regulation, such as the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex  ,  , no study has so far addressed the relative contribution of the DLPFC and lateral OFC during reappraisal. In the present study, we tested the prediction that the DLPFC serves a more general cognitive control function in emotion regulation, whereas the lateral OFC is uniquely engaged in inhibition of negative emotions during an instruction-induced reappraisal task. To address this issue, we used a 2\u00d72 factorial design crossing factors of instruction (reappraisal vs. no reappraisal) and stimulus valence (emotional vs. non-emotional). This design allowed us to separate activations related to general cognitive control processes (main effect of instruction) and those specifically devoted to the control of negative emotion (instruction \u00d7 stimulus valence interaction), and has recently been used in other emotion regulation tasks such as during distancing   and detachment   from negative emotion. Thus, we hypothesized that the DLPFC would be activated across conditions requiring reappraisal (general contribution), whereas the OFC would be uniquely activated during conditions involving reappraisal of negative emotion (unique contribution). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Ethics Statement \n  \nThe protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Karolinska Institutet. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nWe recruited 61 participants who were free from self-reported life-time psychiatric or neurological disease and medication. Prior to analysis, we excluded 2 left handed participants and 1 participant with abnormal brain anatomy leaving a final sample of 58 (26 men) right-handed, participants with a mean age of 24.02 years (SD\u200a=\u200a2.26). All participants gave informed consent and were paid 400 SEK (approximately 55 USD) for their participation. Due to technical problems, the behavioral rating data were missing for 2 participants, who therefore were excluded from the statistical analyses of the rating data. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nForty negative and 40 neutral pictures were selected based on normative ratings from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS)  . Each category of negative and neutral stimuli was divided into two sets (A and B) consisting of 20 negative and 20 neutral stimuli each so that order of presentation and coupling between picture set (A/B) and instruction (Reappraise/Attend) was balanced between participants. Two-tailed   t  -tests yielded significantly lower valence (  p  <.05 ) and higher arousal (  p  <.05 ) ratings for negative compared to neutral pictures, whereas there were no differences in arousal or valence between the two negative picture sets (  p  >.05) or between the two neutral picture sets (  p  >.05) (see  ). Stimuli were displayed via fMRI-compatible goggles (NordicNeuroLab, Bergen, Norway) and the experiment was programmed in Presentation\u00ae v.14 (Neurobehavioral Systems Inc., Albany, CA). \n   Mean valence and arousal ratings for the negative and neutral stimuli.        \n\n### Procedure \n  \nMost previous studies on instruction-induced emotion regulation have typically excluded a control condition involving a regulation instruction preceding neutral picture trials. The basic rationale for this was described in an early emotional suppression study  , in which participants reported confusion when instructed to suppress emotional reactions to neutral pictures. However, two more recent studies have reported successful compliance during regulation of neutral trials, using distancing   and detachment   as regulation instructions. Therefore, in the current study, we performed extensive pilot testing to confirm that participants could comply with the instructions Attend (i.e. \u201cpassively view the picture without trying to manipulate ongoing responses\u201d) and Reappraise (i.e. \u201crelate to the picture in non-emotional terms by reinterpreting the content of the picture so that it no longer elicits a response\u201d) independently of whether they preceded neutral or negative trials. An example of an instruction that was given for Reappraise neutral trials was \u201ceven if you do not experience the picture to be very emotional, you should maintain the regulation instruction and reinterpret the meaning of the picture in order to further neutralize your experience of the picture\u201d. Before beginning the experiment, all participants performed 12 practice trials that mirrored the experimental procedure, gave verbal confirmation on understanding how to comply with the instructions, and gave a short description of how they were to do so. No participants reported confusion about how to adopt a reappraisal strategy for the neutral and negative trials before or after completing the experimental task. The experiment consisted of four types of trials: 20 attend negative, 20 reappraise negative, 20 attend neutral and 20 reappraise neutral. Trial presentation was pseudo-randomized with no more than two consecutive trials of the same condition. On each trial, participants were given a 2 s written instruction on the screen (attend/reappraise) after which they viewed a picture (negative/neutral) for 5 s. After each picture viewing phase, subjects rated their current level of discomfort on a scale ranging from 1 to 7, on which 1\u200a=\u200aminimal or no discomfort and 7\u200a=\u200amaximal discomfort. This was done in order to assess the affective experience of the participant after completing each trial. Each trial ended with the presentation of a fixation cross that was jittered 3\u20135 s between trials ( ). Ratings were performed on a MRI-compatible joystick (Mag Design and Engineering Sunnyvale, CA;  ). \n   Experimental procedure.  \nEach trial began with an initial 2 sec instruction to either \u201cAttend\u201d or \u201cReappraise\u201d which was followed by a 5 sec presentation of a negative or a neutral picture. During attend trials, participants were instructed to attend to the picture without trying to alter any ongoing feelings and on reappraise trials they were instructed to neutralize their feelings to the picture. After each picture viewing phase, participants indicated their current level of discomfort on a scale from 1 to 7 (1\u200a=\u200aminimal or no discomfort, 7\u200a=\u200amaximum discomfort). Each trial ended with a fixation cross jittered between trials with a duration of 3\u20135 seconds. \n  \n\n### Image Acquisition \n  \nAn anatomical scan and fMRI data were obtained using a GE Sigma Echo Speed 1.5 T scanner and an 8-channel head-coil. Functional scans were obtained using a gradient echo sequence T2*-weighted echoplanar imaging (EPI) scan (TR\u200a=\u200a2.5 sec, TE\u200a=\u200a40 ms, flip angle\u200a=\u200a90 degrees, 32 axial slices in ascending order (thickness\u200a=\u200a3 mm with 1 mm gap) and a field of view (FOV)\u200a=\u200a22 cm\u00d722 cm, matrix size\u200a=\u200a64\u00d764). The first ten scans were defined as dummy scans to allow for longitudinal T1-equilibrization and these were not included in the analysis. Functional image acquisition was divided into 2 runs of 245 volumes with a break of approximately 20\u201330 sec between the runs. A T1-weighted structural image (3D-SPGR) was also collected at the end of the experiment. \n\n\n### Image Preprocessing and Analysis \n  \nAll imaging data were analyzed with SPM8 (Statistical parametric mapping, The Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London) running on Matlab20010a (MathWorks, Natick, MA). For each subject, individual images were first slice-time corrected to adjust for acquisition time differences between the slices and realigned to the first volume to correct for head movement. The T1-weighted image was then co-registered with the mean EPI image and subsequently segmented using the unified segmentation approach as implemented in the \u201cNew Segment\u201d routine in SPM8 to generate gray and white matter images. These images were then used within the DARTEL toolbox to create structural templates across subjects as well as individual flow fields that were then used to spatially normalize the EPI images into MNI space. Finally, all images were spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 8 mm and temporally high-pass filtered with a cutoff of 128 to remove low-frequency drifts. \n\nStatistical analysis was performed using standard procedures for fMRI involving a fixed effect model at the single-subject level and a random effects model at the group level  . For each participant, boxcar regressors representing the 5 s duration of each condition (Reappraise negative, Attend negative, Reappraise neutral, Attend neutral) was convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function and subsequently entered into a general linear model as implemented in SPM. Realignment parameters were included as regressors of no interest to account for variance related to movement. In a second level random effects group analysis, we specified a 2 (Instruction) \u00d7 2 (Valence) within-subject ANOVA with non-sphericity correction using the flexible factorial option in SPM8. \n\nGiven the role of the amygdala in emotional processing   and that this region has been shown to be modulated by reappraisal  ,  , we defined the amygdala as an a priori region of interest (ROI). To confirm that our task successfully engaged the amygdala, we looked at the main effect of Valence (Attend negative + Reappraise negative > Attend neutral + Reappraise neutral). The ROI was created around the right and left amygdala using the automated anatomical labels of the Wake Forest University (WFU) PickAtlas toolbox  . Activation within the ROI was considered significant at p<.05, family-wise error (FWE) corrected together with a 10 voxel cluster threshold. To investigate activations that were related to the reappraisal instruction in general, we looked at the main effect of Instruction (Reappraise negative + Reappraise neutral > Attend negative + Attend neutral). Finally, to address activations that were specifically related to reappraisal of negative emotion, we looked at the Instruction \u00d7 Valence interaction given by the interaction term Reappraise (negative- neutral) > Attend (negative \u2013 neutral). Given our a priori hypothesis regarding the contributions of the DLPFC and the lateral OFC in emotion regulation, these regions were predefined as ROIs (DLPFC\u200a=\u200amiddle frontal gyrus; lateral OFC\u200a=\u200ainferior and middle orbital gyri) using the automated anatomical labels of the Wake Forest University (WFU) PickAtlas toolbox  . Unless stated otherwise, activation within the ROIs was considered significant at   p  <.05, FWE together with a 10 voxel cluster threshold. To more fully explore the neural regions related to regulation, we supplemented these ROI analyses with whole brain analyses that were considered significant at   p  <.05, FWE corrected, together with a cluster threshold of 10 voxels (see Supplementary data). All reported coordinates refer to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Ratings \n  \nTo index whether the images were experienced as less negative after regulation, participants were instructed to rate their current level of discomfort after each picture-viewing phase. As expected, discomfort ratings were lower on Reappraise than on Attend trials both for negative and neutral stimulus pictures ( ). A 2 (Instruction: reappraise vs. attend) \u00d7 2 (Valence: negative vs. neutral) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), resulted in significant main effects of Instruction   F  (1, 55)\u200a=\u200a83.55,   p  <.001, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a.60 and Valence   F  (1, 55)\u200a=\u200a194.31,   p  <.001, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a.78, as well as a significant Instruction \u00d7 Valence interaction   F  (1, 55)\u200a=\u200a60.22,   p  <.001, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a.52. The reliable interaction was driven by significantly lower discomfort ratings on Reappraise (negative-neutral) than on Attend (negative\u2013neutral) trials. To confirm this interpretation, we first subtracted ratings during the viewing of neutral pictures from ratings during the negative pictures for each instruction and then compared these difference terms, which resulted in a highly significant difference,   p  <.001 ( ). \n   Behavioral results.  \nDiscomfort ratings were significantly lower during   A  .

As expected, the analysis revealed a significant bilateral amygdala activation in response to negative compared to neutral pictures (right amygdala: x\u200a=\u200a20, y\u200a=\u200a\u22122, z\u200a=\u200a18,   T  \u200a=\u200a12.19,   k  \u200a=\u200a566 voxels; left amygdala: x\u200a=\u200a\u22122, y\u200a=\u200a\u22123, z\u200a=\u200a\u221218,   T\u200a=\u200a  10.10,   k  \u200a=\u200a508 voxels),   p  <.05, (FWE). More specifically, we wanted to confirm that we (a), accomplished successful emotion elicitation, as demonstrated by greater amygdala activation in the contrast Attend negative > Attend neutral  ,  , and (b), that reappraisal had a down-regulating effect on the amygdala response, as demonstrated by a greater amygdala activity in the contrast Attend negative > Reappraise negative  . One-sample t-tests confirmed a significantly larger bilateral amygdala activation in the Attend negative > Attend neutral condition (right amygdala x\u200a=\u200a21, y\u200a=\u200a0, z\u200a=\u200a\u221219,   T\u200a=\u200a  4.24,   k  \u200a=\u200a192 voxels; left amygdala x\u200a=\u200a\u221220, y\u200a=\u200a1, z\u200a=\u200a\u221218,   T\u200a=\u200a  4.80,   k  \u200a=\u200a192 voxels) as well as during the Attend negative > Reappraise negative condition (right amygdala x\u200a=\u200a20, y\u200a=\u200a\u22122, z\u200a=\u200a\u221218,   T\u200a=\u200a  11.13,   k  \u200a=\u200a564 voxels; left amygdala x\u200a=\u200a\u221218, y\u200a=\u200a\u22122, z\u200a=\u200a\u221216,   T\u200a=\u200a  9.25,   k  \u200a=\u200a508 voxels),   p  <.05, (FWE). \n\n\n### Main Effect of Instruction \n  \nTo test our hypothesis that activation in the DLPFC would be significantly related to the reappraisal instruction across picture valence, we first investigated the effect of the reappraisal instruction. In line with our hypothesis, the instruction to \u201cReappraise\u201d compared to \u201cAttend\u201d resulted in significant activations only in the DLPFC ROI (  and  ) but not in the lateral OFC ROI. A whole brain analysis revealed significant activation in a fronto-parietal attentional control network involving dominantly right-sided activations in DLPFC and inferior parietal lobe (see  ). \n   Statistical parametric maps showing activations during the main effect of instruction and the Instruction\u00d7 Valence interaction (A).  \nActivation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during the main effect of instruction across stimulus valence in Reappraise (negative + neutral) > Attend (negative + neutral). Significant activations are displayed overlaid on the DLPFC region-of-interest (ROI) image (shown in blue) in sagittal (upper left), coronal (upper right) and axial (lower left) view, respectively and the (  B  ) corresponding contrast estimates for the right and left DLPFC and lateral OFC at peak activation coordinates [right doroslateral PFC: x\u200a=\u200a39, y\u200a=\u200a24, z\u200a=\u200a36; left DLPFC: right OFC; x\u200a=\u200a26, y\u200a=\u200a46, z\u200a=\u200a\u221213; left OFC: x\u200a=\u200a\u221236, y\u200a=\u200a46, z\u200a=\u200a\u221212]. Note that the activations were not significant in the lateral OFC.

All activations were thresholded at   p  <.05 (FWE) and were based on the DLPFC and lateral OFC ROIs. *\u200a=\u200a  p  <.05 (FWE). Error bars represent standard error of the mean. \n     Group activations during Reappraise > Attend collapsed across Stimulus valence (negative/neutral) and during interaction between Instruction (Reappraise vs. Attend) and Stimulus Valence (negative vs. neutral).        \n\n### Instruction \u00d7 Valence Interaction \n  \nTo investigate the brain areas devoted to reappraisal of negative emotion when controlling for the main effect of instruction, we tested the effect of the Instruction \u00d7 Valence interaction within the DLPFC and the lateral OFC ROIs This contrast revealed mainly bilateral activation in the lateral OFC and to smaller extent activation within the DLPFC (  and  ) A whole brain analysis did not reveal any additional prefrontal areas (see  ). \n\n\n### Simple Effects of Regulation \n  \nTo further investigate the Instruction \u00d7 Valence interaction and in parallel to the results reported for the behavior data, we additionally ran one-sample t-tests comparing activations in Reappraise vs. Attend to neutral and negative trials separately within the DLPFC and lateral OFC ROIS. As predicted, whereas the DLPFC was significantly activated in both reappraisal contrasts irrespectively of whether reappraisal effort was targeted on negative (Reappraise negative > Attend negative) or neutral stimuli (Reappraise neutral > Attend neutral), the lateral OFC was uniquely activated during reappraisal of negative stimuli (  and  ). To confirm that the specificity of these effect could not simply be ascribed to differences in degree of activation or due to thresholding, we additionally tested the effect of Reappraise neutral > Attend neutral within the lateral OFC ROI at a more liberal threshold of   p<  .01 uncorrected. This analysis still did not reveal any activation within the lateral OFC during the neutral condition (see   for results from the whole brain analysis). \n   Statistical parametric maps showing activations during reappraisal of negative and neutral stimuli.  \n(  A  ) Activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in the Reappraise negative > Attend negative and (  B  ) in the right DLPFC during Reappraise neutral > Attend neutral, and (  C  ) overlapping activations in the right DLPFC in the conjunction analysis of the common effect of Reappraise negative > Attend negative and Reappraise neutral > Attend neutral. Significant activations are displayed overlaid on the DLPFC region-of-interest (ROI) image (shown in blue) and the lateral OFC ROI (shown in green) in sagittal view. (  D  ) Contrast estimates extracted for the right DLPFC and the right lateral OFC during the Reappraise negative > Attend negative contrast [DLPFC: x\u200a=\u200a42, y\u200a=\u200a24, z\u200a=\u200a39; lateral OFC: x\u200a=\u200a42, y\u200a=\u200a45, z\u200a=\u200a\u22129] and the Reappraise neutral > Attend neutral contrast [right DLPFC: x\u200a=\u200a33, y\u200a=\u200a43, z\u200a=\u200a30; right lateral OFC x\u200a=\u200a25, y\u200a=\u200a36, z\u200a=\u200a\u22128]. Note that the activations were not significant for the lateral OFC in Reappraise neutral > Attend neutral or in the conjunction analysis. Activations were thresholded at   p  <.001 (uncorrected) for illustrative purposes and were based on the DLPFC and lateral OFC ROIs. *\u200a=\u200a  p  <.05 (FWE). *\u200a=\u200a  p  <.05 (FWE). Error bars represent standard error of the mean. \n     Group activations for \u201cReappraise\u201d vs. \u201cAttend\u201d during negative and neutral trials.        \nFor clarity, we also confirmed that neither of our prefrontal ROIs was significantly more activated during reappraisal of neutral trials as compared to during the reappraisal of negative trials. Neither ROI showed significant activation in Reappraise neutral > Reappraise negative (  p  <.05, FWE). \n\n\n### Common Effects of Regulation \n  \nFinally, we wanted to establish that activation of the DLPFC was shared between the reappraisal contrasts and that this shared activation was specific to the right DLPFC. Therefore, we conducted a conjunction analysis testing overlapping activity during the contrast Reappraise negative > Attend negative and Reappraise neutral > Attend neutral within the right DLPFC. As predicted, the conjunction analysis revealed significant overlapping activity in the right DLPFC (  and  ), confirming that the activation in DLPFC was not restricted to reappraisal of negative stimuli. Testing for an effect within the lateral OFC ROI at a more liberal threshold of   p<.  01 uncorrected still did not reveal activation in the lateral OFC that was shared between the negative and neutral regulation contrasts. Results from the whole brain analysis did not reveal significant activations in any prefrontal regions apart from the DLPFC. In addition, this analysis revealed activity in a region in the inferior parietal cortex (see  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn line with our hypothesis regarding the distinct roles of the DLPFC and the lateral OFC in emotion regulation, our results showed that the DLPFC was activated across the reappraisal task irrespectively of whether the reappraisal effort was targeted on negative or neutral stimuli. In contrast, the lateral OFC was uniquely engaged during reappraisal of negative stimuli. \n\nFirst, our task resulted in larger amygdala responses to negative as compared to neutral stimuli, indicating that negative stimuli elicited a greater emotional response. Second, we demonstrated that reappraisal instructions resulted in down-regulation of the larger amygdala response to negative stimuli. In terms of brain regions activated during reappraisal, we found a main effect of the reappraisal task across stimulus valence that was restricted to the DLPFC and the inferior parietal cortex (see  ). By demonstrating robust activation in the fronto-parietal attentional control network, we showed that the effect of the regulation task across both negative and neutral stimulus overlapped with the effect commonly reported for the main emotion regulation contrast (i.e. Reappraise negative > Attend negative) in previous studies  ,  \u2013 ,  ,  . Furthermore, the DLPFC was not uniquely related to reappraisal of negative emotion. Rather, the DLPFC was the only prefrontal region that was significantly activated during reappraisal of both negative and neutral stimuli. Critically, we identified voxels within the DLPFC that showed overlapping activity in both reappraisal conditions, indicating a general activation of this region during implementation of regulation. In light of the observed pattern of activity, we suggest that activity in the DLPFC reflects the effortful processing that accompanies reappraisal, perhaps by maintaining the attentional demands of the task. Although different cognitive processes may give rise to the same pattern of brain activation, our interpretation is consistent with previous research using other cognitive control tasks to demonstrate that DLPFC activity increases with increasing task load  , and that activity within this region represents the active maintenance of task-related requirements for attentional control  . \n\nAssuming that activity in the DLPFC reflects cognitive processing that is inherent to the reappraisal task, it is therefore not surprising that activity within this region was observed across negative and neutral conditions involving the reappraisal instruction. Consequently, this gave rise to activation patterns that were shared with the lateral OFC, as was seen in activation in both regions during reappraisal of negative emotion. Importantly though, unlike the general recruitment of the DLPFC across reappraisal conditions, activity in the lateral OFC was uniquely observed during reappraisal of negative stimuli. The location and functional neuroanatomy of the OFC makes it ideally suited for suppressing neural activity in subcortical structures due to its rich reciprocal connectivity to both the PFC and emotion generating processing regions  . A comprehensive meta-analysis on the role of the OFC has suggested that subregions within this region serve functionally distinct roles  . According to this view, while activity in the medial region of the OFC is related to monitoring, learning and memory of the reward value of reinforcing stimuli, activity within the lateral regions of the OFC is more related to evaluation of punishers that can promote behavioral change  . In line with a medial-lateral division within the OFC, previous reappraisal studies have demonstrated an association between increased medial OFC activity and reactivity to emotional material  ,  , whereas lateral OFC activity has been associated with down-regulation of emotional responses  ,  ,  , and a functional coupling with the amygdala during reappraisal  ,  . In fact, in a mediation analysis reported by Wager and colleagues  , the lateral OFC was identified as a core region mediating reappraisal success through two independent subcortical pathways involving the nucleus accumbens that predicted successful reappraisal, and the amygdala, that predicted unsuccessful reappraisal. These results were interpreted to suggest that the lateral OFC is engaged both by a negative appraisal process that involves the amygdala, and a positive appraisal process involving the nucleus accumbens. As such, our results are supported by these data as they implicate the lateral OFC as critically involved in the regulation of emotion. Moreover, our results fits particularly well with a recent study   that directly contrasted emotion regulation accomplished by two different regulation strategies and reported that the lateral OFC was specifically engaged by reappraisal as compared to when using the strategy of distancing. Importantly, the present results, which directly compared the relative contribution of the DLPFC and the lateral OFC during reappraisal, are consistent with the proposed role of these regions in other regulation tasks, such as during the regulation of pain  ,  \u2013  and selective attention  ,  . \n\nAlthough our findings point to a specific contribution of the lateral OFC during down-regulation of negative emotion, previous studies have also implicated this region during regulation of positive emotion   and during up-regulation of negative emotion (but see  ,   for opposite findings). Nevertheless, directly contrasting specific aspects of emotion regulation, such as contrasting different regulation strategies  , down- and up-regulation of emotion  ,  ,  , and regulation effort targeted on positive and negative emotion  , represent related strategies to address the specific contributions of different prefrontal regions during emotion regulation. \n\nAn important limitation of the present findings lies in the nature of the reappraisal task. Although widely used as model of instructed emotion regulation  , the task suffers from limited experimental control as there are no means by which it is possible to confirm exactly what is going on during the different instructions, or exactly what strategies are being employed at a given point in time. This matter is of particular relevance for the interpretation of the current findings, which rest on the assumption that participants could comply with the reappraisal instruction during both negative and neutral trials. As is the case with previous reappraisal studies   successful compliance with the instructions can only be obtained by self-reports and subjective ratings after each trial, which are likely to be biased by experimental demands. In the present study, and in previous studies adopting a balanced design by crossing factors of Instruction (regulate vs. passive viewing) with Stimulus valence (negative vs. neutral)  ,  , participants were asked to rate their response not only to negative, but also to neutral stimulus pictures, which might have introduced further complications  . To make sure that our participants understood the rating procedure, they were exposed to an extensive training session, in which they were encouraged to ask questions and to discuss their task until they felt confident that they knew how to complete it successfully. As a result, they did not report any confusion about how to adopt a reappraisal strategy during negative and neutral trials. The self-reported data however still allow for alternative interpretations. Although participants are likely to have complied with the instruction to reappraise on neutral trials (i.e. they experienced stimuli as more neutral after reappraisal), the drop in discomfort ratings could reflect that participants were merely complying with the demands imposed by the experimental setup (i.e. reporting something that believed to comply with the instruction). In future studies, it might be informative to include ratings of subjective experience of effort, which presumably are less susceptible to experimental demands and that can be more directly related to activity in prefrontal areas such as the DLPFC that, at least partly, may reflect task demand. \n\nTaken together, this study is the first to directly contrast the relative contribution of two key regions during reappraisal; the DLPFC and the lateral OFC. We argue that (a) the DLPFC and the lateral OFC both contribute to negative emotion regulation, but (b) that these regions partly reflect different aspects of the emotion regulation process. Critically, our results showed that in contrast to the more general pattern of activation in the DLPFC, the lateral OFC was specifically and uniquely activated during reappraisal of negatively valenced stimuli. These findings add to a growing literature focused on disentangling the contributions of different prefrontal regions during emotion regulation. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone-0048107-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tValence\tArousal\nNegative\t1.9 (0.34)\t6.5 (0.59)\nNeutral\t4.9 (0.55)\t3.01 (0.90)\n### Caption\nMean valence and arousal ratings for the negative and neutral stimuli.\n### Footer\nStandard deviations (SD) are shown in parenthesis.\n\n\n## ID: pone-0048107-t002\n### Label: Table 2\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tPeak coordinates\tPeak coordinates\tPeak coordinates\tPeak coordinates\tPeak coordinates\tPeak coordinates\tPeak coordinates\nRegion\tBA\tSide\tNumberofvoxels\tx\ty\tz\tT\nMain effect of Instruction:Reappraise (negative + neutral) > Attend (negative + neutral)\tMain effect of Instruction:Reappraise (negative + neutral) > Attend (negative + neutral)\tMain effect of Instruction:Reappraise (negative + neutral) > Attend (negative + neutral)\tMain effect of Instruction:Reappraise (negative + neutral) > Attend (negative + neutral)\tMain effect of Instruction:Reappraise (negative + neutral) > Attend (negative + neutral)\tMain effect of Instruction:Reappraise (negative + neutral) > Attend (negative + neutral)\tMain effect of Instruction:Reappraise (negative + neutral) > Attend (negative + neutral)\tMain effect of Instruction:Reappraise (negative + neutral) > Attend (negative + neutral)\nMiddle frontal\tBA9\tR\t3557\t39\t24\t36\t6.97\n\t\tL\t20\t\u221238\t48\t14\t4.50\nInstruction \u00d7 Stimulus valence interaction:Reappraise (negative \u2212 neutral) > Attend (negative \u2212 neutral)\tInstruction \u00d7 Stimulus valence interaction:Reappraise (negative \u2212 neutral) > Attend (negative \u2212 neutral)\tInstruction \u00d7 Stimulus valence interaction:Reappraise (negative \u2212 neutral) > Attend (negative \u2212 neutral)\tInstruction \u00d7 Stimulus valence interaction:Reappraise (negative \u2212 neutral) > Attend (negative \u2212 neutral)\tInstruction \u00d7 Stimulus valence interaction:Reappraise (negative \u2212 neutral) > Attend (negative \u2212 neutral)\tInstruction \u00d7 Stimulus valence interaction:Reappraise (negative \u2212 neutral) > Attend (negative \u2212 neutral)\tInstruction \u00d7 Stimulus valence interaction:Reappraise (negative \u2212 neutral) > Attend (negative \u2212 neutral)\tInstruction \u00d7 Stimulus valence interaction:Reappraise (negative \u2212 neutral) > Attend (negative \u2212 neutral)\nOrbitofrontal\tBA10\tR\t98\t42\t50\t\u221210\t5.04\n\t\tL\t217\t\u221238\t60\t\u22124\t5.68\nMiddle Frontal\tBA9\tR\t34\t46\t21\t44\t4.61\n\t\tL\t56\t\u221239\t24\t32\t4.76\n### Caption\nGroup activations during Reappraise > Attend collapsed across Stimulus valence (negative/neutral) and during interaction between Instruction (Reappraise vs. Attend) and Stimulus Valence (negative vs. neutral).\n### Footer\nAll reported activations are based on anatomical ROI analysis and significant at p<.05 (FWE).Note: BA\u200a=\u200aBrodmann area; R\u200a=\u200aRight; L\u200a=\u200aLeft.

Healthy right-handed subjects (12 men, 12 women) were investigated with 3T-fMRI during synonym generation. Behavioral performance and sex hormone levels were assessed. Women were examined during the early follicular and midluteal cycle phase. The activation pattern in all groups involved left frontal and temporal as well as bilateral medial frontal, cingulate, occipital, basal ganglia, and cerebellar regions. Men showed greater left frontal activation than women in both menstrual cycle phases. Women yielded high correlations of left prefrontal activation with estradiol in the midluteal phase and with progesterone in both phases. Testosterone levels correlated highly with left prefrontal activation in all three groups. In all, we describe a cerebral network involved in semantic processing and demonstrate that it is significantly affected by gender and sex steroid hormones. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSemantic retrieval is a memory process involving word meaning. It entails several cognitive processes such as perceiving a target word, holding it online in working memory, retrieving its meaning, activating related concepts and, depending on the task at hand, actively searching for concepts with equivalent meaning. To date, semantic retrieval has primarily been investigated in the context of word-fluency or category-fluency tasks, in which subjects have to produce a list of members of a category. Functional imaging investigations on semantic fluency tasks emphasize the role of the left inferior frontal and premotor cortex in a network including cingulate gyrus, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (Audenaert et al.  ; Basho et al.  ; Gourovitch et al.  ; Hirshorn and Thompson-Schill  ; Klein et al.  ; Nyberg et al.  ). \n\nSemantic processing has often been related to gender or hormonal influences, however the results are heterogeneous. Behavioral studies yielded variable results on the influence of gender in semantic tasks. Some authors reported higher verbal performance in women (Kimura and Clarke  ; Weiss et al.  ; Wirth et al.  ) while others could not detect differences (Roberts and Bell  ). Likewise, the influence of menstrual cycle (Gordon and Lee  ; Rode et al.  ) and sex steroid hormones is controversially discussed (Carlson and Sherwin  ; Roberts and Bell  ; Thilers et al.  ; Yonker et al.  ). Using functional imaging, some investigators observed physiological correlates of gender differences in semantic processing, e.g. higher activation in women than men (Baxter et al.  ; Jaeger et al.  ; Ragland et al.  ) or vice versa (Bell et al.  ; Buckner et al.  ; Gizewski et al.  ; Rossell et al.  ) (for details see \u201c \u201d). Others were unable to confirm these findings (Gur et al.  ; Halari et al.  ,  ; Schlosser et al.  ; Sommer et al.  ; Weiss et al.  ). Some of these controversies on gender differences may relate to effects of sex steroid hormones and menstrual cycle, which are not taken into consideration in most imaging studies. While one functional imaging study failed to find hormonal influences on a rhyming decision with word pairs (Veltman et al.  ), Fernandez et al. demonstrated hormone-, task-, and region-specific variations across the menstrual cycle in women performing a semantic decision task. Women in the midluteal phase showed higher activation compared to women in the perimenstrual phase (Fernandez et al.  ). This is in agreement with Dietrich et al. who described a more global influence of cycle phase on magnitude and extent of activations during word-stem-completion with the most pronounced signal increases in the midluteal phase (Dietrich et al.  ). Influences of gender, menstrual cycle, and sex steroid hormones are not restricted to semantic functions, though. Our group recently reported sex differences in a spatial working-memory task that were related to testosterone and estrogen levels. Men showed stronger activation than women in the left inferior parietal lobe, left fusiform gyrus and lingual gyrus. Testosterone correlated with brain activation in men and women in the low estrogen phase, while estrogen showed large correlations with brain activation in both women groups, indicating that sex hormones might indeed contribute to fMRI variability in cognitive tasks (Sch\u00f6ning et al.  ). \n\nIn the present study, we apply a synonym generation task requiring silent retrieval of as many synonyms as possible while striving for high synonym quality, emphasizing the semantic challenge of the task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study taking into account the influences of gender, menstrual cycle phases, and sex hormone levels on activation patterns in fMRI during semantic retrieval. The main objective of this study is to characterize cerebral networks during synonym generation. In addition, we hypothesize that brain activation patterns are influenced by gender, phases of the female menstrual cycle, and serum levels of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. Based on previous findings, we conjecture that women outperform men and show higher levels of brain activation. We also expect higher activations in the midluteal than in the perimenstrual phase. To explore if sex steroid hormones exert an independent effect, hormone levels will be correlated with brain activation within each group separately. \n\n\n## Material and methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nThirty-four healthy, right-handed, heterosexual German subjects (age-range 23\u201345 years) participated in the study after giving their informed consent. The study was approved by the local Institutional Ethical Review Board and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Men were examined once, women twice in pseudo-randomized order\u2014once 1\u20133 days after onset of menses (early follicular phase) and once in the midluteal phase adjusted for cycle length (individual cycle length \u22127 days with a range of \u00b12 days). Only pre-menopausal women with stable cycle length were included and any form of hormonal treatment was excluded. The phase of the menstrual cycle was confirmed by sex steroid hormone analysis (for details see below). None of the subjects had a history of a serious medical disease, or any neurological or psychiatric illness. Twelve females and 12 males were included in the final analysis (for details see Table\u00a0 ).   \nSubjects baseline characterization and task performance (mean \u00b1 SD) \n  \n T   tests between groups are not significant if not indicated otherwise.  Value differs significantly from value in other groups \n\n For women during the early follicular phase and women during the midluteal phase versus men   P   < 0.001 \n\nFor women during the early follicular phase versus men   P   = 0.008. For women during the midluteal phase versus men   P   < 0.001 and versus women during the early follicular phase   P   < 0.001 \n\nFor women during the midluteal phase versus men   P   < 0.001 and versus women during the early follicular phase   P   < 0.001 \n  \n\nReasons of exclusion were either technical or to achieve homogeneity of the hormonal status and cycle phase. A second fMRI scan could not be obtained for two women. In six female participants, the sex steroid hormone analysis revealed values not corresponding to the target phase of their menstrual cycle that was expected from their menstrual history (four anovulatory cycles, two cycles with high progesterone levels in the presumed early follicular phase). Two males were excluded because of unusually low or high testosterone levels. \n\nIntelligence was assessed using CFT 20 (Weiss  ) and MWT-B (Lehrl et al.  ), two German standard short measures for estimating intelligence quotients based on visuo-spatial and verbal material, respectively. There were no significant differences between men and women for age or intelligence measures (see Table\u00a0 ). All participants had more than 12 years of education. Handedness was assessed by the Edinburgh handedness inventory (Oldfield  ). \n\n\n### Sex steroid hormone assessment \n  \nBefore fMRI scanning, a venous blood sample was drawn to determine total testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This was always done between 2 and 5 pm in order to minimize known day-time variation (Chappell  ; Davison and Bell  ). Men were excluded from further analysis if serum testosterone levels were below 2.3 ng/ml and above 8 ng/ml. Women were diagnosed as being in the early follicular phase of menstrual cycle if onset of menstrual bleeding had started and if serum estradiol and progesterone levels were \u226470 pg/ml and <1 ng/ml, respectively. They were categorized as being in the midluteal phase of menstrual cycle if onset of menstrual bleeding had occurred at individual cycle length minus 7 days (\u00b12 days) prior to the examination. All included women had estradiol levels \u226566 pg/ml and progesterone levels \u22654 ng/ml. FSH and LH levels were within the normal range of premenopausal women in all female subjects (FSH < 15 IU/L, LH < 20 IU/L). All hormone analyses were performed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays (ECLIA, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany, as described in  ). \n\n\n### Experimental design \n  \nDuring fMRI scanning, five synonym generation condition blocks (  S  ) were administered, each consisting of 30 s task performance, followed by a 30 s rest period (  R  ), according to an   S  \u2013  R  \u2013  S  \u2013  R  \u2013  S  \u2013  R  \u2013  S  \u2013  R  \u2013  S  \u2013  R   design. Synonym generation is considered a task that reflects both semantic retrieval and verbal fluency. During each block, two German adjectives were presented using Presentation Software\u00ae (Version 0.81, 2004, Neurobehavioral Systems Inc., Albany, CA, USA) on an MR compatible back-projection screen. Word frequency of adjectives was balanced between blocks (Celex Lexical Database for German, Release 2, Version 2.5, cf. (Baayen et al.  )). Subjects were instructed to silently retrieve as many synonyms as possible until the appearance of a new word or until a fixation cross indicated the beginning of the rest period. The instruction further urged subjects to strive for quality of the synonyms. These data were obtained as part of a larger protocol. Women were tested twice, receiving two equivalent versions of the synonym retrieval task in a counter-balanced order in their early follicular and midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Each of the versions was randomly administered to 50% of the men. \n\nSynonym retrieval was performed again after fMRI scanning, with subjects speaking aloud to obtain behavioral measures. Adjectives were presented on a computer screen and responses were recorded. This post-scanning synonym task was performed on the ten previously seen adjectives, aiming to probe performance in the scanner (  reproduction condition  ). Subjects were also tested on seven new adjectives to test the de novo generation of synonyms (  novel generation condition  ). \n\n\n### Analysis of behavioral data \n  \nTwo types of analyses were performed on the behavioral responses to assess quantity and quality of the retrieved synonyms. Total word count served as global   quantity score  . A synonym   quality score   was obtained by categorizing responses according to their status as (near) synonyms. This was done by checking their occurrence in two synonym dictionaries (M\u00fcller  ; Wahrig  ). Quality-to-quantity ratios indicate the proportion of synonyms relative to the total of produced words. Thus, the following performance measures were established: a Quantity score, a Quality score, a Quality\u2013quantity-ratio both for the reproduction and the novel generation conditions (see Table\u00a0 ). Differences between men and the women in both phases were assessed using unpaired   t   tests, while differences between women as a function of menstrual cycle were tested using paired   t   test. \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nMRI data were acquired in a 3 T whole body scanner (Intera T30, Philips, Best, NL) equipped with master gradients (nominal gradient strength 30 mT/m, maximal slew rate 150 mT/m per millisecond). A circularly polarized transmit/receive birdcage head coil with a HF reflecting screen at the cranial end was used for spin excitation and resonance signal acquisition. Functional images were acquired using a T  weighted single shot echo-planar (EPI) sequence (whole brain coverage, TE = 50 ms, TR = 3,000 ms, flip angle 90\u00b0, slice thickness 3.6 mm without gap, matrix 64 \u00d7 64, FOV 230 mm, in-plane resolution 3.6 \u00d7 3.6 mm). Thirty-six transversal slices orientated parallel to the AC\u2013PC line were taken. \n\n\n### MRI data analysis \n  \nFunctional MRI data were analyzed using SPM2 standard routines and templates ( ). To allow for saturation effects of the BOLD signal, the first ten images of each session (30 s pre-stimulus interval) were discarded. The remaining images were realigned, normalized and resliced to a voxel size of 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm , and smoothed with a 9 mm kernel. Data were then filtered with a high-pass filter (cut-off period of 128 s). BOLD-responses for synonym generation were modeled using a boxcar function convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function employed by SPM2. To obtain activation maps across subjects, the functional data were combined in a random-effects analysis to identify brain areas activated during synonym generation. In a first level fixed-effects analysis, we obtained one statistical parametric map (SPM) and corresponding contrast images for each subject, reflecting the contrasts of interest. These individual contrast images were entered into a second-level random-effects analysis to determine activations at a group level. The second-level analysis consisted of three steps:   \n Step 1  : Within-group activation patterns were assessed by one sample   t   tests in a random-effects analysis. The alpha error was set to   P   < 0.05 corrected (false discovery rate) and the contiguity threshold to \u226520 voxels. To allow comparability with other studies, in particular to assure independence from sample sizes,   T   values were converted into Cohen\u2019s   d   effect sizes according to Cohen\u2019s   (Cohen  ; Kline  ), using the vbm2 toolbox provided by C. Gaser, University of Jena, Germany ( ).   T   and   d   values were overlaid on a single-subject template provided in MRIcron (Rorden et al.  ). Anatomical localizations of activated brain regions were identified using the MSU toolbox based on the Talairach daemon (Lancaster et al.  ). \n  \n Step 2  : Differences between groups were calculated within the regions that showed activation in the group results (step 1), using an ANOVA model. The alpha error was set to   P   < 0.001 uncorrected and the contiguity threshold to \u226520 voxels. To assure comparability across studies, differences are reported as   T   and Cohen\u2019s   d   values and were overlaid on a single-subject template provided in MRIcron (see above). \n  \n Step 3  : The correlation of brain activation with hormone levels for estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone was investigated in areas activated in the group results (from step 1). Simple regression (correlation) analysis was performed for testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone. For descriptive analysis, unthresholded   T   values were converted into correlation coefficients r using the cg_t2x.m script provided by C. Gaser, University of Jena, Germany ( ). The corresponding   P   values were determined from   r   values using the online calculator for scientists at Graphpad Software ( , degrees of freedom = 10). Correlation coefficients (and equivalent   P   values) were overlaid on a single-subject template provided in MRIcron (Rorden et al.  ). \n  \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Task performance \n  \nThere were no significant differences between males and females in both phases of the menstrual cycle in any of the post hoc performance measures. Small differences between means, such as higher scores for men during word reproduction, or higher scores for midluteal women during novel word generation, were within the range of the SD. During the reproduction condition, subjects produced an average word quantity of 48.9 \u00b1 20.2 words, of which only 9.8 \u00b1 3.3 words met the criteria for synonym quality, corresponding to a Quality\u2013quantity-ratio of 0.23 \u00b1 0.12. During the novel generation condition, the average number of words generated to novel target adjectives was 43.3 \u00b1 16.9 with 5.7 \u00b1 2.0 synonyms, corresponding to a Quality\u2013quantity-ratio of 0.16 \u00b1 0.10 (for details see Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Within-group activation patterns during synonym generation \n  \nThe synonym retrieval task led to prominently left lateralized prefrontal activation. Both men and women showed extensive activations on the lateral surface of the frontal cortex, comprising the left inferior and middle frontal gyri, the precentral gyrus, and the right inferior frontal gyrus. On the medial surface of the hemispheres, bilateral activation of superior and medial frontal gyrus (supplementary motor area, SMA) and the anterior cingulate gyrus were noted. Another consistent pattern of activation was observed in the middle occipital gyrus and lingual gyrus, as expected due to the baseline visual and reading components of the task. In addition, parts of the basal ganglia and cerebellum were active bilaterally (for details see Fig.\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0 ).   \nBrain activation during synonym generation in women during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, women during the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and men. Statistical   T   maps and   d   maps for effect sizes are rendered on a single-subject template in MNI space (thresholded at an alpha-error level of   P   < 0.05 corrected (false discovery rate), contiguity threshold of \u226520 voxels) \n    \nMain cluster coordinates and cluster sizes for the synonym generation task \n  \n P  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 corrected (false discovery rate), cluster size \u226520 voxels \n  \n\n\n### Between-group activation patterns during synonym generation \n  \nGroup comparisons demonstrated significantly more activation of the left middle frontal and left precentral gyrus in men than in women in either phase (Figs.\u00a0 ,  ; Table\u00a0 ). The difference between men and women in their early follicular phase was larger (cluster size 155 voxels) than the difference between men and women in their midluteal phase (cluster size 63 voxels). Women showed a trend towards higher activation of prefrontal regions when in their midluteal phase, which did not reach statistical significance (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nDifferences in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation in (  a  ) men compared to women during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, and (  b  ) men compared to women during the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle.

Maps for correlation coefficients   r   are rendered on a single-subject template in MNI (  r   from 0.2 to 1 corresponds to   P   from 0.533 to <0.001) \n  \n\nEstradiol showed high correlations with left prefrontal activations for women in their midluteal phase (  r   = 0.6,   P   = 0.039). Estradiol correlated only weakly with left prefrontal activation when women were in the early follicular phase (  r   < 0.3,   P   = 0.343) and in men (  r   < 0.2,   P   = 0.533). \n\nProgesterone showed high correlations with left prefrontal activation in women both in the early follicular (  r   = 0.6,   P   = 0.039) and the midluteal phase (  r   = 0.7,   P   = 0.011), while correlations in men were weak (  r   < 0.2,   P   = 0.533). \n\nTestosterone values were strongly correlated with left prefrontal activation in all three groups, that is men (  r   = 0.6,   P   = 0.039), women in their early follicular phase (  r   = 0.5,   P   = 0.098), and women in their midluteal phase (  r   = 0.7,   P   = 0.011). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe main objective of this study was the characterization of cerebral networks during synonym generation. We also hypothesized that brain activation patterns are influenced by gender, phases of the female menstrual cycle, and serum levels of sex steroid hormones. We observed activation of the classical language and memory areas. In the absence of behavioral differences, men showed higher brain activation in left frontal language areas than women. Women showed a trend towards higher activation in the midluteal phase. The correlation of brain activation with sex hormone levels was different between groups and across the menstrual cycle. \n\n### Within-group activation patterns during synonym generation \n  \nSynonym generation has rarely been investigated using functional imaging techniques, while word generation, word and category fluency tasks have been investigated more often. Left lateralized activation of the frontal cortex, including precentral, inferior, and middle frontal gyri is characteristic for word generation (Klein et al.  ; Nyberg et al.  ). Left frontal areas are also active when words are semantically associated (Buckner et al.  ; Chee et al.  ; Chou et al.  ,  ; Gabrieli et al.  ; Price  ; Woodward et al.  ), or when words are pronounced silently (Bookheimer  ; Borowsky et al.  ; Huang et al.  ). SMA and cingulate gyrus are involved in word generation and semantic retrieval (Etard et al.  ; Papathanassiou et al.  ). The anterior inferior temporal gyrus has been associated with lexical retrieval (Brunswick et al.  ), and the left posterior middle temporal lobe with semantic processing, such as the association of objects on the basis of their meaning (Chou et al.  ; Price  ; Woodward et al.  ). Cerebellar activation has previously been reported in silent speech generation and synonym generation as well (Jansen et al.  ; Klein et al.  ; Nyberg et al.  ). The synonym generation paradigm, thus far only used sparsely in combination with functional imaging techniques, provides stable patterns of brain activation with predominant activation of left prefrontal language regions. \n\n\n### Gender effects during synonym generation \n  \nIn accordance with our hypothesis, we observed gender-related differences in the degree of brain activation in the key left frontal language areas. The difference in activation between men and women was most pronounced in the left middle frontal and precentral gyri. It was most pronounced when men were compared to women during the early follicular phase of their cycle. The gender differences reported here cannot be attributed to differences in verbal performance in our fMRI subject sample, as behavioral performance did not significantly differ between groups on any measure. Buckner and colleagues reported a PET study in which brain activation during verb generation was larger in magnitude in men than in women. While hormonal status of women was not reported, this result is in accordance with our present study (Buckner et al.  ). Gizewski et al. replicated these results comparing men and women, more specifically, women in their midluteal phase (Gizewski et al.  ). In a smaller sample, Halari et al. observed no significant differences in brain activation between men and women using a letter fluency task (Halari et al.  ). In accordance with a meta-analysis including 377 men and 442 women (Sommer et al.  ), synonym generation was strongly left-lateralized in men and women. \n\n\n### Menstrual cycle effects during synonym generation \n  \nOnly few studies have so far attempted to measure the influence of fluctuating sexual hormone levels across the menstrual cycle on fMRI activation patterns. Some behavioral observations point towards an effect of sexual hormones on cognitive functions (Hampson  ; Hausmann and Gunturkun  ), but this is discussed controversially (Gordon and Lee  ; Halari et al.  ; Roberts and Bell  ). Our current results, while obtained from a rather small sample size, do not support the hypothesis of performance differences in the measures applied. Our imaging results might indicate that menstrual cycle effects on fMRI activation patterns are unrelated to task performance, thus favoring a more biological explanation. This would be in accordance with an earlier and smaller study of Dietrich et al. who investigated six male and six female subjects during a word-stem-completion task, a mental rotation task, and a motor task (Dietrich et al.  ). In both cognitive tasks, the most pronounced increases of BOLD signal were observed in women during the peak estrogen condition (midluteal phase), while no significant differences occurred between male and female subjects in the low estrogen condition. This is in line with the trend observed in the present study. Fernandez et al. investigated 12 women, but no men, with a synonym-judgment task. In agreement with our data, they also observed higher activation during the midluteal phase (Fernandez et al.  ). In a study on emotional word processing, medio-orbitofrontal activity was also increased in the midluteal phase (Protopopescu et al.  ). In contrast, Veltman et al. investigated eight women and could not find influences of estrogen on a rhyming decision on word pairs. This lack of effect could possibly be attributed to the choice of the activation paradigm (phonological rather than semantic), and the small sample size (Veltman et al.  ). While we observed a trend towards higher left prefrontal activation, this trend did not reach statistic significance. However, this trend is in line with the data obtained by Dietrich et al. ( ), Fernandez et al. ( ) and Protopopescu et al. ( ). The lack of significance could imply that menstrual cycle does not exert any effects on BOLD signal, but given the data by others, it is more plausible that the effects are too small to reach statistic significance with group sizes of 12 subjects. We thus conclude that fMRI studies on semantic tasks should pay attention to menstrual cycle effects if group sizes exceed 12 subjects per group. \n\n\n### Correlation of brain activation with sex steroid hormone measurements \n  \nA major strength of this study is that sex hormone concentrations were assessed right before scanning. We were thus able to correlate sex hormone levels with brain activation during task performance. Interestingly, correlations depended on gender and phase of the menstrual cycle: estradiol correlations with brain activation were high in the high estrogen phase of the menstrual cycle, while progesterone correlations were significant in both phases investigated here. Testosterone correlated strongly with brain activation in all three groups. Our results underscore the potential influence of sex hormones on neurocognitive processes. The role of sex steroid hormones is extensively discussed for memory-related tasks, first and foremost in the context of hormone substitution in aging or demented populations. Effects for both testosterone (Driscoll and Resnick  ; Geerlings et al.  ; Zitzmann  ) and estradiol (Craig and Murphy  ; Doren  ; Genazzani et al.  ) have been reported for different cognitive domains. While our results are in line with findings on spatial working memory (Sch\u00f6ning et al.  ), findings on verbal memory are more ambiguous, reporting diverse effects of estrogen and/or testosterone (Carlson and Sherwin  ; Cherrier et al.  ; Martin et al.  ; Moffat et al.  ; Thilers et al.  ). In particular, the influence of sex hormones on behavioral performance is controversial. While some authors report behavioral effects (Hampson  ; Hausmann and Gunturkun  ) others do not (Gordon et al.  ; Gordon and Lee  ; Halari et al.  ; Mumenthaler et al.  ; Roberts and Bell  ). Our results also do not reveal performance differences in the behavioral measures applied here. Nevertheless, the results of the present study suggest that sex steroid hormones exert more direct effects on fMRI BOLD-signal changes which are unrelated to task performance. Our results fit well with the above-mentioned earlier studies on other verbal tasks, with the most pronounced increases of BOLD signal in women during the peak estrogen (midluteal) phase (Dietrich et al.  ; Fernandez et al.  ; Protopopescu et al.  ). \n\n\n### Physiological mechanisms \n  \nObviously, fMRI does not allow to directly investigate the biological and molecular action mechanisms underlying different BOLD responses in men and women, as a function of the phases of the menstrual cycle, and of sex hormone levels. Thus, sex hormone action on cerebral neurons or vascular effects would both be consistent with our results. Sex steroid hormones might exert direct effects on cerebral neurons, reflected by altered brain activation by many different routes. These effects might be mediated by intracellular neural estrogen receptors such as ER-alpha and ER-beta, but also by dendritic, presynaptic, or glial estrogen receptors, by ligand-gated ion channels, by effects on gene expression or on neural excitability, by second-messenger systems, or by interactions with the neurotransmitter systems. Alternatively or in addition, the neurovascular coupling might be altered by estrogen-induced cerebral vasodilatation and blood-flow changes. Estrogen might increase the concentration of vasodilatory nitric oxide (NO) through an Akt/PKB-enzyme dependent pathway and the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Although our data cannot clarify the mechanisms of action, they reveal an influence of gender, phase of menstrual cycle, and sex hormone levels on brain activation. Our results suggest that differences in brain activation do not solely depend on estrogen levels, as we found a clear-cut difference between men and women in their low estrogen phase. This can only be explained by a combined effect of sex steroid hormones. Indeed, correlations with progesterone in the female groups, and particularly testosterone in all three groups, emphasize the role of all three hormones on fMRI activation during synonym retrieval. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nSome limitations of our study should be mentioned. Rigorous exclusion of subjects with abnormal sex hormone levels restricted the sample size to 12 subjects per group, limiting statistical power. Further, behavioral measures had to be acquired outside the scanner to avoid artifacts related to motor or verbal responses during functional image acquisition. As in many imaging study, cognitive effort required for task performance could not be measured. Nevertheless, we aimed at obtaining objective performance measures for synonym retrieval reflecting within-scanner performance by examining both repeated and novel target items. In particular, the cautious control of hormonal levels is unique to the present fMRI study design. \n\nThis study demonstrates a cerebral network involved in semantic retrieval that is influenced by gender and sex steroid hormones. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table\u00a01\nUnnamed: 0\tWomen during early follicular phase\tWomen during midluteal phase\tMen\nNumber of subjects\t12\t12\t12\nAge\t30.8 \u00b1 5.0\t30.8 \u00b1 5.0\t33.2 \u00b1 6.2\nIntelligence, more visuo-spatially based estimate measure (CFT)\t118.3 \u00b1 13.7\t118.3 \u00b1 13.7\t124.0 \u00b1 10.2\nIntelligence, more verbally based estimate measure (MWT-B)\t112.0 \u00b1 13.6\t112.0 \u00b1 13.6\t117.0 \u00b1 11.9\nTestosterone in ng/mla\t0.34 \u00b1 0.13\t0.37 \u00b1 0.13\t5.10 \u00b1 1.45*\nEstradiol in pg/mlb\t46.75 \u00b1 11.10*\t129.00 \u00b1 56.81*\t36.0 \u00b1 6.30*\nProgesterone in ng/mlc\t0.65 \u00b1 0.15\t10.02 \u00b1 5.70*\t0.70 \u00b1 0.20\nReproduction Quantity score\t47.7 \u00b1 21.0\t48.3 \u00b1 18.9\t50.8 \u00b1 22.3\nReproduction Quality score\t9.3 \u00b1 4.0\t9.8 \u00b1 3.1\t10.2 \u00b1 2.8\nReproduction Quality/quality ratio\t0.23 \u00b1 0.12\t0.24 \u00b1 0.14\t0.23 \u00b1 0.09\nNovel generation Quantity score\t40.6 \u00b1 19.3\t44.8 \u00b1 16.8\t44.7 \u00b1 15.7\nNovel generation Quality score\t4.7 \u00b1 1.4\t6.6 \u00b1 2.1\t5.9 \u00b1 2.0\nNovel generation Quality/quality ratio\t0.16 \u00b1 0.15\t0.17 \u00b1 0.09\t0.14 \u00b1 0.06\n### Caption\nSubjects baseline characterization and task performance (mean \u00b1 SD)\n### Footer\nT tests between groups are not significant if not indicated otherwise. *Value differs significantly from value in other groupsa For women during the early follicular phase and women during the midluteal phase versus men P < 0.001bFor women during the early follicular phase versus men P = 0.008.
