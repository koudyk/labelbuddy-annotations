When making these choices, individuals evaluate their willingness to obtain a job (i.e., job values), primarily driven by simulation of future pay and interest. Despite the importance of these decisions, their underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we examined the neural representation of pay and interest. Forty students were presented with 80 job names and asked to evaluate their job values while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Following fMRI, participants rated the jobs in terms of pay and interest. The fMRI data revealed that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was associated with job value representation, and the ventral and dorsal regions of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) were associated with pay and interest representations, respectively. These findings suggest that the neural computations underlying job valuation conform to a multi-attribute decision-making framework, with overall value signals represented in the vmPFC and the attribute values (i.e., pay and interest) represented in specific regions outside the vmPFC, in the PCC. Furthermore, anatomically distinct representations of pay and interest in the PCC may reflect the differing roles of the two subregions in future simulations. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAs one\u2019s job is a key factor in one\u2019s happiness ( ), career choices affect not only our financial status but also our future well-being ( ;  ;  ). In fact, inappropriate career choices negatively affect mental health ( ;  ) as well as physical health ( ). Given the implications for social and medical policy making, career choices are receiving increasing attention in many fields such as economics, management, and psychology ( ;  ). \n\nIn the fields of psychology and economics, the psychological process of career choice is modeled as a type of multi-attribute decision-making. Multi-attribute decisions are decisions in which options are evaluated according to several attributes ( ;  ;  ;  ). Accumulating evidence shows that, for multi-attribute decision-making, the overall value of an option is computed by the weighted addition of attribute values ( ;  ;  ). On the other hand, several studies have suggested that an individual takes into account multiple attributes of a job when making a career choice ( ;  ). In particular, evaluation of a job is driven by its pay and its interest rather than other attributes (e.g., interpersonal relationships), as shown in a classical international survey ( ). This designation of two key attributes of job value (pay and interest) is consistent with two recent large-scale studies ( ;  ). \n\nIn the field of neuroeconomics, the neural mechanisms of multi-attribute decision-making are gradually being revealed. The overall value of an option is independent of sensory modality. Both the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum, which are components of the dopaminergic reward pathway ( ), represent modality-independent values ( ;  ). In multi-attribute decision-making, the vmPFC is typically assumed to be the region that integrates various attribute values and then computes the overall value of an object ( ;  ;  ). On the other hand, recent studies showed that specific brain regions other than the two modality-independent regions can represent individual attribute values. For example, the visual value of a T-shirt (i.e., how much an individual likes its visual features) and its semantic value (i.e., how much an individual likes the meaning and concepts associated with the words printed on the T-shirt) are processed by the fusiform gyrus and posterior superior temporal gyrus, respectively ( ). Furthermore,  ) suggested that the nutritive attribute values of food (i.e., protein, fat, carbohydrates, and vitamins) are represented in different regions in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. \n\nPrevious neuroeconomic studies, however, did not address the multi-attribute decisions that require future simulation, such as career choice. The decisions examined in previous studies seemed to have involved an immediate reward (i.e., decisions with immediate consequences). The studies did not assume that participants evaluated future values, and their tasks were performed under the assumption that any value would be obtained immediately. On the other hand, career choices require future simulation. As part of a decision-making process, people evaluate a job that they may have in the future. Furthermore, people typically stay at a chosen job for a long time ( ;  ). Therefore, before a decision is made, future simulation in which the job value is evaluated is required (i.e., decisions with future consequences) ( ). Accordingly, the exploration of the neural mechanisms underlying career choice represents an initial attempt to address multi-attribute decision-making with future simulation. \n\nThe values of the two key attributes of a job, pay and interest, may be represented in distinct cortical areas. Although both values are likely constructed by imagining the future consequences of the job choice, the underlying simulation processes seem qualitatively different due to the different natures of the values. Typically, the pay is externally given as an outcome of the work ( ;  ;  ), whereas the interest is internally attained during the process of doing the work ( ;  ). \n\nA candidate cortical representation of the two attribute values is in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The PCC has been implicated in various functions potentially useful in guiding the computation of values ( ). This region is also involved in envisioning the future (future simulation) ( ;  ). Furthermore, segregated subregions in the PCC may represent pay and interest. For example, some studies have suggested that anterior\u2013posterior segregation corresponds to differentially directed thoughts (internally/externally directed thoughts) ( ), and others have suggested that ventral\u2013dorsal segregation corresponds to the levels of future simulation (outcome/process simulation) ( ). \n\nIn this study, to elucidate the neural mechanism of multi-attribute decisions with future consequences, we examined neural representations of pay and interest, expecting representation of these attribute values in the PCC. Eighty job names were presented, and participants evaluated their willingness to obtain each job (i.e., job value) while their brain activity was measured. Following the evaluation and outside the MRI scanner, participants evaluated the pay and interest of the 80 jobs. To dissociate the subregions representing pay versus interest, the jobs used in this experiment were selected such that pay and interest were independent. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nAll participants provided written informed consent before inclusion in the study, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The Tohoku University School of Medicine Ethics Committee approved the study protocol (2017-1-220). A total of 40 healthy right-handed students from Tohoku University (21 males; mean age 21.28 [range 18\u201324] years) participated. Students with majors in medical science or nursing science were excluded as they are typically assumed to become medical doctors and nurses, respectively ( ;  ), and may therefore have already decided on a job, making them unable to seriously engage in the job valuation task. Handedness was evaluated using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory ( ). All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of neurological or psychiatric illness. The data from one participant were excluded due to technical errors. The 39 remaining participants (21 males; mean age, 21.33\u00a0years; range, 18\u201324\u00a0years) were included in the study. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nTo select 80 jobs with minimal correlation between pay and interest, we conducted a preliminary experiment. A total of 349 jobs were chosen from a list of jobs on a job information website ( ). Seventeen participants (healthy university students who did not participate in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment; 8 males; mean age 22.24\u00a0years) rated the pay and interest of the included jobs. The instructions for rating were \u201cIs the job\u2019s pay level high?\u201d and \u201cIs the job interesting? (is this a job you really like?)\u201d; participants rated pay and interest on a Likert-like scale from 1 (no) to 5 (yes). We selected the jobs for which the correlation between pay and interest was the lowest by performing 1 million permutations using R software (version 3.3.3,  ; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The list of jobs and the references for their pay are shown in   and  . \n\n\n### Valuation Task (Inside the MRI Scanner) \n  \nEach trial was composed of a valuation phase (4\u00a0s) and a rating phase (2.5\u00a0s). In the valuation phase, one job was presented, and the participants rated their willingness to obtain the job ( ). Participants were instructed to focus on the extent to which they wanted the job without considering realistic constraints, such as their ability or opportunity. In the rating phase, a Likert-like scale from 1 (no) to 4 (yes) was presented, and the participant rated the job by pressing the key on an MRI-compatible response box attached to their right hand. To exclude motor-related responses of no interest, the response button mapping (left to right and right to left) was randomized across trials. To reduce mistakes, immediate feedback was provided regarding the rating chosen, and participants were allowed to correct it until the end of the rating phase. A white fixation cross was presented between trials (intertrial interval phase, randomly jittered between 2 and 6\u00a0s). The task consisted of four runs of 80 trials. In each of the runs, 80 jobs were presented once in random order, and the participants evaluated each job four times in total. We used the average rating over the four trials as the job value. The job names were projected onto a semilucent screen behind the head coil and shown via a mirror attached to the head coil at a visual angle of less than 5\u00b0. \n  \nExperimental task. (  A  ) Timeline of one trial of the valuation task (fMRI data measured). In each trial, participants viewed a job and evaluated the willingness to obtain the job (i.e., job value), which was rated on a Likert-like scale ranging from 1 (no) to 4 (yes). The trials were separated by a variable intertrial interval phase that lasted between 2 and 6\u00a0s. (  B  ) Examples of stimuli in trials of the attribute-rating task (outside the MRI scanner). Runs of pay rating and interest rating were divided. The instructions, job name, and rating scale are displayed in the upper, middle, and lower rows, respectively. The same jobs presented during the valuation task were presented one by one, and participants rated the pay of, or interest in, the job on a Likert-like scale ranging from 1 (no) to 8 (yes), with no time constraint. \n  \n\n### Attribute-rating Task (Outside the MRI Scanner) \n  \nParticipants rated the pay and interest of the 80 jobs ( ) by responding to two questions: \u201cIs the job\u2019s pay level high?\u201d and \u201cIs the job interesting? (Is this a job you really like?).\u201d Participants rated pay and interest on a Likert-like scale from 1 (no) to 8 (yes). The instructions used were as described in a previous study ( ). The ratings of pay and interest were divided into different runs, and the order of these runs was randomized across participants. In each run, the order of the jobs was randomized across the job set. The task was given after completing the valuation task so that the participants were not made explicitly aware of these attributes while rating job value. \n\n\n### Behavioral Data Analysis \n  \nWe set out to establish whether the willingness to obtain a job (i.e., job value) is guided by its pay and interest. \n\nFirst, we inspected rating histograms of job value, pay, and interest (  and  ) and confirmed that pay and interest were almost independent; although significantly positive, the mean of correlations between the two attributes calculated at the individual level was small [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD)\u2009=\u20090.16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21,   t   (38)\u2009=\u20094.69,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001]. Furthermore, we confirmed intersession consistency among the four sessions for rating of job value by calculating the Fleiss kappa (\u03ba) ( ) value at the individual level using R software. The median \u03ba value across participants was 0.61 (25% quartile: 0.51; 75% quartile: 0.74), indicating at least moderate or substantial intersession consistency ( ). \n\nIn the main analysis, we employed generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs;  ) implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks) to confirm that the two-attribute-value model allowed better prediction of job value compared to reduced-attribute-value models (i.e., pay-only model, interest-only model, and no-attribute-value model). In all models, the dependent variable was the job value, which was modeled assuming a normal distribution. The independent variables were the attribute values in each model; the variables were pay and interest in the two-attribute-value model, pay in the pay-only model, interest in the interest-only model, and no attribute value was applied in the no-attribute-value model. The model specifications in Wilkinson notation were as follows: two-attribute-value model, job value ~\u20091\u2009+\u2009pay\u2009+\u2009interest\u2009+\u2009(1\u2009+\u2009pay\u2009+\u2009interest\u00a0|\u00a0subject); pay-only model, job value ~\u20091\u2009+\u2009pay\u2009+\u2009(1\u2009+\u2009pay\u00a0|\u00a0subject); interest-only model, job value ~\u20091\u2009+\u2009interest\u2009+\u2009(1\u2009+\u2009interest\u00a0|\u00a0subject); no-attribute-value model, job value ~\u20091\u2009+\u2009(1\u00a0|\u00a0subject)]. The magnitudes of pay and interest were their rating scores in an attribute-rating task. We used Akaike information criterion (AIC) ( ) values to compare the predictions of the models. \n\n\n### Image Acquisition and Data Analysis \n  \n#### MRI Data Acquisition \n  \nAll MRI data were acquired using a 3\u00a0T Philips Achieva scanner (Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Functional images were acquired using echo-planar functional images sensitive to blood oxygenation level-dependent contrast (64\u2009\u00d7\u200964 matrix, repetition time\u2009=\u20092750\u00a0ms, echo time\u2009=\u200930\u00a0ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200980\u00b0, field of view\u2009=\u2009192\u00a0mm, 44 slices, 3-mm slice thickness). In each session, initial dummy volumes were excluded for magnetic stabilization. In total, the remaining 1140 volumes used in the analysis were acquired in 52.25\u00a0min. \n\n\n#### fMRI Data Processing \n  \nAnalyses of the fMRI data were performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12; Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology) implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks). Regions of interest (ROIs) were created using the SPM toolbox MarsBaR ( ). All of the images from each participant were preprocessed using the following procedure: corrections for slice timing and head motion, spatial normalization to the echo-planar imaging Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template, and smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of 8-mm full width at half maximum. \n\n\n#### fMRI Data Analysis \n  \nStatistical analyses were performed using a conventional two-level approach for multiple-subject fMRI datasets. At the within-subject level, trial-related activity was estimated within the framework of a general linear model (GLM). Next, at the group level, the activation profiles of the identified brain regions were examined by one-sample   t   test. We performed ROI analysis for further quantitative assessment of the functional segregation of the activation clusters representing pay and interest. \n\nAt the within-subject level, we estimated GLMs to identify the brain regions representing pay, interest, and job value. The activity was modeled by convolving a time-series model of the neural response with a canonical hemodynamic response function. A first-degree autoregressive [AR(1)] model was used to correct for temporal autocorrelation. We modeled a regressor for activation during job presentation and rating scale presentation, and additional regressors for parametric modulation of activation during job presentation by the values (i.e., job value, pay, and interest). As the job value depends on pay and interest, the regression of three variables in a single model at the same time causes multiple collinearity. Therefore, to solve this problem, we used two separate GLMs for job value and the two attribute values. For GLM1, job value was determined as the average rating of the scores entered during presentation of the rating scale across the four sessions. For GLM2, the values of pay and interest were obtained in an attribute-rating task; we did not use orthogonalization of regressors. For both GLMs, regressors for six parameters of head motion were included as covariates. High-pass filtering with a frequency cut-off of 1\u00a0cycle/128\u00a0s was applied to decrease the effects of low-frequency noise. \n\nAt the group level, to identify the brain regions indicating significantly positive effects of job value (i.e., from GLM1) and the two attribute values (i.e., pay and interest; from GLM2), we conducted one-sample   t   tests of the coefficients for these three variables across all participants. The statistical threshold at each voxel was   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 (uncorrected), which was corrected to the family-wise error of   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 for multiple comparisons at the cluster level. \n\nAs group-level results indicated that activation clusters representing pay and interest were located somewhat more ventrally and dorsally in the PCC, respectively (see Results for details), we performed a quantitative analysis of spatial segregation within the PCC. We tested for spatial segregation according to pay and interest along the ventral\u2013dorsal midline axis within the PCC using an approach similar to those described in previous studies ( ;  ). First, we obtained a sagittal view of the statistical parametric map representing both pay and interest (map of average contrast of pay and interest with a threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, uncorrected). Second, we generated four ROIs with equally spaced coordinates spanning the ventral-to-dorsal extent of the activation cluster (spheres of radius 4\u00a0mm with the following central coordinates: ROI 1,   x  \u2009=\u20090,   y  \u2009=\u2009\u221257,   z  \u2009=\u200918; ROI 2,   x  \u2009=\u20090,   y  \u2009=\u2009\u221262,   z  \u2009=\u200925; ROI 3,   x  \u2009=\u20090,   y  \u2009=\u2009\u221267,   z  \u2009=\u200932; ROI 4,   x  \u2009=\u20090,   y  \u2009=\u2009\u221272,   z  \u2009=\u200939;  ). The number of ROIs was set as four, which was the maximum number that could be placed without overlaps between neighboring ROIs. Using GLM2, the coefficient of neural activation associated with pay and that with interest at the time of job presentation were extracted from the ROIs for each individual. Finally, we ran a GLMM for spatial segregation (i.e., GLMM1). The dependent variable was the coefficient, which was modeled assuming a normal distribution. The independent variables were type of attribute value (pay: 0, interest: 1), ROI location (ROI 1: 1, ROI 2: 2, ROI 3: 3, ROI 4: 4), and the interaction between type of attribute value and ROI location. The model specification in Wilkinson notation was as follows: the coefficient ~1\u2009+\u2009type of attribute value\u00a0*\u00a0ROI location\u2009+\u2009(1\u2009+\u2009type of attribute value\u00a0*\u00a0ROI location\u00a0|\u00a0subject). We expected the GLMM results to show the interaction as a fixed effect to reveal segregated representation of pay and interest in the ventral and dorsal PCC. Furthermore, we additionally constructed two GLMMs to confirm the spatial gradient of neural activation associated with each attribute value\u2014the first was a GLMM for determining the spatial gradient of neural activation associated with pay (i.e., GLMM2) and the second was a GLMM for determining the spatial gradient of neural activation associated with interest (i.e., GLMM3). The dependent variable was the coefficient of neural activation associated with the model\u2019s attribute value, that is, the variable was the coefficient of neural activation associated with pay in GLMM2 and that associated with interest in GLMM3. The independent variable was ROI location. The model specifications in Wilkinson notation were as follows: GLMM2, coefficient of neural activation associated with pay ~\u20091\u2009+\u2009ROI location\u2009+\u2009(1\u2009+\u2009ROI location\u00a0|\u00a0subject); GLMM3, coefficient of neural activation associated with interest ~\u20091\u2009+\u2009ROI location\u2009+\u2009(1\u2009+\u2009ROI location\u00a0|\u00a0subject). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Data \n  \nThe two-attribute-value model was better at predicting job value compared to the reduced-attribute-value models. The AIC value of the two-attribute-value model (6319.0) was lower than those of the reduced-attribute-value models (no-attribute-value model: 8165.8; pay-only model: 8025.3; interest-only model: 6375.8). Furthermore, in the two-attribute-value model, the effects of pay and interest on job value were significantly positive [coefficient for pay ( )\u2009=\u20090.05, standard error (SE)\u2009=\u20090.01,   t  \u2009=\u20093.93,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001;  \u2009=\u20090.30, SE\u2009=\u20090.02,   t  \u2009=\u200913.29,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001], validating the contributions of these attribute values to job value. \n\n\n### Neural Representation of Job and Attribute Values \n  \nWe identified the brain regions representing job value and the two attribute values. Significant effects of job value in GLM1 were identified in the vmPFC, PCC, left inferior frontal gyrus, right and left inferior frontal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, and right angular gyrus ( ,  ). \n  \nRegions representing job and attribute values \n  \nNotes: The MNI coordinates (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ) of the activation peak,   t  -value, cluster size (  k  : number of voxels; voxel size\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u00a0mm ), and   P  -value (corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level) for the activation of each effect are presented. \n    \nRegions representing job value (effect of job value). The map of activation was overlaid on the Ch2bet template as implemented in MRIcron and shown in sagittal (top left and bottom left) and axial sections (top right and bottom right). The statistical threshold at the voxel level was set at   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 and corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level (family-wise error,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05). \n  \nIn GLM2, both attribute values were represented in the PCC ( ), whereas the distribution of the activation clusters differed: activation clusters representing pay and interest were located more ventrally and dorsally in the PCC, respectively. \n  \nRegions representing pay and interest (effect of pay: red; effect of interest: blue). Sagittal, coronal, and axial sections are shown. The statistical threshold at the voxel level was set to   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 and corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level (family-wise error,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05). \n  \n\n### Spatial Segregation of the PCC for Pay and Interest Representations \n  \nWe then quantified the spatial segregation according to pay and interest within the PCC. GLMM1 indicated that the interaction between type of attribute value and ROI location was significant ( \u2009=\u20090.11, SE\u2009=\u20090.04,   t  \u2009=\u20092.54,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05;  ). Furthermore, GLMM2 indicated that the coefficient of neural activation for pay exhibited a decreasing trend from the ventral to dorsal PCC ( \u2009=\u2009\u22120.06, SE\u2009=\u20090.03,   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22121.76,   P  \u2009=\u20090.08), whereas GLMM3 indicated that the coefficient of neural activation for interest increased significantly from the ventral to dorsal PCC ( =\u20090.05, SE\u2009=\u20090.02,   t  \u2009=\u20092.11,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05). These results indicate that the ventral and dorsal regions of the PCC represent pay and interest, respectively. \n  \nAnalysis of spatial gradients for pay and interest.

Error bars represent the standard error. \u201c1\u201d represents the ventral end of the ROI and \u201c4\u201d the dorsal end, with the numbers 1\u20134 in the bar graph corresponding to the ROI numbers in Panel   A  . \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study investigated the cortical representation of pay and interest, two key attributes of job value involved in career decisions. The behavioral data confirmed that pay and interest have positive effects on the willingness to obtain a particular job (i.e., job value), which suggested that our participants were also considering pay and interest when computing job value. fMRI analysis indicated that pay and interest are associated with the PCC. Furthermore, our ROI analysis indicated that segregated subregions of the PCC, the ventral and dorsal regions, are associated with pay and interest, respectively. \n\nThese results are consistent with recent neuroscience evidence regarding multi-attribute decision-making. Several studies have revealed that the vmPFC represents integrated values (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ). Moreover, recent studies have revealed that attribute values constituting the value of an item are processed outside the vmPFC and integrated in the vmPFC ( ;  ;  ;  ). The present results revealed that the vmPFC represented job value, whereas the PCC represented attribute values. \n\nThe segregated representation of pay and interest between the ventral and dorsal PCC may be explained by the underlying cognitive processes based on the different roles of these subregions in future simulation. These results suggest that the ventral PCC represents pay as the value constructed by imagining what we can obtain when we attain future goals (i.e., outcome simulation) ( ). This implication is consistent with previous studies. The ventral PCC has been shown to be involved in the simulation of consumption events (e.g., party and vacation;  ) that individuals typically dream of accessing if sufficient income allowed ( ). Furthermore, the ventral end of the PCC, sometimes called the retrosplenial cortex, may be involved in outcome simulation constructed by reward memory ( ;  ;  ;  ). On the other hand, the dorsal PCC may be involved in the value constructed by imagining how we can attain future goals (i.e., process simulation) ( ;  ). This implication is consistent with previous studies. For example, one view in psychology suggests that interest comes from performing the job ( ;  ), so interest may be involved in process simulation. Previous studies have indicated that process simulation is associated with the dorsal PCC or precuneus ( ;  ). \n\nSegregated representation of attribute values in the PCC may be comparable to those in the orbitofrontal cortex in terms of functional organization. In the orbitofrontal cortex, value representation is segregated in an anterior\u2013posterior manner, corresponding to abstraction level differences in sensory information processing: the anterior and dorsal regions correspond to abstract and concrete information processing, respectively ( ;  ;  ;  ). On the other hand, in the PCC, value representation is segregated in a ventral\u2013dorsal manner, corresponding to the different attribute values associated with different simulation levels (i.e., process or outcome) in future simulations. \n\nUnlike other animals, humans are assumed to make sophisticated decisions with future consequences ( ;  ). The present study suggests that the ventral and dorsal regions of the PCC represent different attribute values of a job, which may suggest that these regions act together to evaluate future consequences. This view of ventral\u2013dorsal cooperation is consistent with the assumed mechanisms of various future-envisioning processes, such as autobiographical future thought ( ;  ) and episodic future simulation ( ). Furthermore, the PCC is more developed in modern humans compared with primitive humans and apes ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). This region is involved in unique human functions, such as episodic memory retrieval, self-processing, and visuospatial imagery ( ), and it may also be involved in future simulation in humans. Taken together, these findings suggest that career choice may be an example of sophisticated decision-making based on future consequences that is enabled by the integration of multiple attributes processed by highly developed cortical regions in the human brain. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nIt is important to note that while we showed positive effects of pay and interest on job value, job value is unlikely to depend exclusively on these attributes. Job value also depends on other attributes, such as interpersonal relationships in the workplace ( ). In fact, representation of job value has been identified in various brain regions, such as the left inferior frontal gyrus, right and left inferior frontal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, and right angular gyrus, in addition to the vmPFC and PCC. These regions may also represent attribute values other than pay and interest. Furthermore, a fruitful research agenda will involve quantifying additional elemental and cultural factors that influence valuation, determining the neural representation of those variables, and establishing how the various signals are integrated to compute an overall value. \n\nJob value measured on a four-point Likert-like scale is related to ordinal utility rather than cardinal utility. Therefore, we cannot argue that the neural representation of that value is associated with reward quantity, in contrast to previous studies using probabilistic reward and willingness-to-pay tasks ( ). However, we consider ordinal utility sufficient for identifying the regions associated with processing values. In fact, the location of the vmPFC representing the value of an object associated with ordinal utility is the same as that associated with cardinal utility ( ;  ), and the location was replicated in the present study. \n\nInterest may be affected by the possibility or plausibility of obtaining a job. People tend to consider plausible actions in simulations of their future ( ;  ). Especially, there is evidence that interest is associated with plausibility because they are both associated with similar factors, such as the self-efficacy of the job ( ) and the abilities needed to do the job ( ). We intended to control for the effect of plausibility by instructing the subjects to focus on the extent to which they wanted the job, but we do not have evidence that this was successful. \n\nAlthough we were interested in the cognitive processes associated with career choices, we did not assume that the findings presented here can explain all of the processes involved in making a career choice. People typically spend a great deal of time in choosing their actual career, whereas the participants in present study considered the jobs for only a short time. Therefore, it is assumed that there are also a number of neural processes other than those represented in this study. \n\n\n\n## Notes \n  \nThis study was conducted using the MRI scanner and related facilities of the Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University.

Previous fMRI studies were focused on the examination of motor-related areas and little is known about the functional changes in the extra-motor areas in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. The aim of this study is to investigate functional cerebral abnormalities in ALS patients on a whole brain scale. Twenty ALS patients and twenty age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled. Voxel-based analysis was used to characterize the alteration of amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF). Compared with the controls, the ALS patients showed significantly decreased ALFF in the visual cortex, fusiform gyri and right postcentral gyrus; and significantly increased ALFF in the left medial frontal gyrus, and in right inferior frontal areas after grey matter (GM) correction. Taking GM volume as covariates, the ALFF results were approximately consistent with those without GM correction. In addition, ALFF value in left medial frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with the rate of disease progression and duration. Decreased functional activity observed in the present study indicates the underlying deficits of the sensory processing system in ALS. Increased functional activity points to a compensatory mechanism. Our findings suggest that ALS is a multisystem disease other than merely motor dysfunction and provide evidence that alterations of ALFF in the frontal areas may be a special marker of ALS. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive atrophy and weakness of the bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles, with a median survival of 3\u20135 years from symptom onset.   Although ALS is predominantly a motor-system-degeneration disease, cognitive and behavioral symptoms have also been observed in ALS patients  . Almost half of ALS patients may have variable degrees of cognitive impairment with typical frontal executive deficits. Fourteen percent of ALS patients may have a clinical subtype of frontotemporal lobar degeneration called frontotemporal dementia  . Generalized sensory system abnormalities which were confirmed by a few large sample studies  ,   support the theory that ALS is a multisystem neurodegenerative disorder. Widespread cerebral degeneration of neurons in typical ALS cases  \u2013  have been observed in post-mortem studies. Moreover, previous studies have suggested that dysfunction of extra-motor systems occurred in ALS patients, such as neurobehavioral dysfunction or frontotemporal dementia, might have negative effects on outcomes of patients  ,  ,  . Current treatments for ALS have limited effectiveness and are far from satisfactory. The lack of insight into the neuropathology of ALS is holding back improvements in ALS therapies  . Thus, it is of utmost importance to elucidate functional changes in both motor and extra-motor systems of the brain of ALS patients. \n\nWith the advantage of being noninvasive, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been extensively applied to study ALS. Most previous fMRI investigations on ALS focused on motor-related neural activity. In studies of motor execution, increased cortical activation has consistently been found in the sensorimotor cortex  \u2013 , premotor areas  \u2013 , and supplementary motor areas  \u2013 . Some brain areas including the inferior parietal lobule  ,  ,  , anterior cingulated cortex  ,  , cerebellum  ,  , basal ganglia  ,  , and thalamus   were less consistent among various studies. The increased cortical activation is commonly thought to be a result of decreased intracortical inhibition, which may act in a compensatory role  . On the other side, a significant decrease of cortical activation caused by the presence of bulbar signs has also been observed when ALS patients performed vertical tongue movement  ,  . This finding indicates that deficits in compensatory processes in patients with bulbar involvement can be the reason of the faster time-course in this subgroup. However, the different patterns of performances or tasks make it difficult to interpret the biological mechanisms of ALS and hinder the application of across-population comparisons. \n\nUnlike the traditional fMRI, the recently developed resting-state fMRI (rfMRI) techniques avoid potential performance confounds that may be present in subjects with cognitive or motor impairments since rfMRI does not require the subjects to perform any task  ,  . Spontaneous low-frequency fluctuation (LFF; <0.08 Hz) of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals during rest has been found to be of physiological importance and related to intrinsic neuronal activity  \u2013 . The measurement of rfMRI BOLD signals is a promising approach to assess regional and neural circuitry function at rest, which has been widely used to study various psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as schizoprehnia  ,  , depression  , Alzheimer's disease  , Parkinson\u2019s disease  ,   and ALS  ,  \u2013 . Using the regions-of-interest (ROI) based approach, several groups reported altered functional connectivity in the motor areas of ALS patients  ,  ,  ,  , as well as in prefrontal and thalamic regions  . However, among these studies, the prior selected seeds were mainly located in the motor network, and prior selection of the time series of particular subregions with which to correlate imposes anatomical restriction on the analysis of network connectivity. Little is known about the neural function beyond the motor network. Only few studies have found that the intrinsic activities altered within sensory-motor network  ,  , default-mode network  ,   and frontoparietal network   in ALS patients. The patterns of intrinsic brain activity in ALS patients across the whole brain are still poorly understood. \n\nZang et al.   developed an index called amplitude of LFF (ALFF) to assess the amplitude of resting-state spontaneous brain activity, by calculating the square root of the power spectrum in a low-frequency range (usually 0.01\u20130.08 Hz). This approach eliminates the need to specify seed locations and can be applied to conduct the whole-brain voxel-wise analysis of cerebral function during the resting state. By measuring ALFF, several recent studies have successfully shown that baseline brain activities were altered in different physiological states of the brain  ,  ,  \u2013 . To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on ALFF alterations in ALS. \n\nIn the present study, we investigated ALS-related alterations of brain activities during the resting state using ALFF, and its correlations with clinical features. We hypothesized that (1) brain activity would be altered in ALS, which is not restricted to the motor system and that (2) ALFF changes in these areas may be correlated with ALS clinical manifestations. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty probable or definite sporadic ALS patients were recruited consecutively from the neurology department of West China Hospital of Sichuan University. ALS patients were diagnosed in accordance with the El Escorial revised criteria  . Sporadic ALS was defined as ALS without family history of ALS. All ALS patients were right-handed. Patients were excluded if they had other neurological diseases or psychiatric problems such as cerebrovascular disorders, hydrocephalus, intracranial mass, psychiatric hospitalization, substance abuse, or traumatic brain injury. All ALS patients underwent a thorough history and physical examination on the day of the study. The severity of the disease was assessed by the ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS) questionnaire  . Muscle strength was scored using the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale from 0 to 5  . Disease duration was calculated from symptom onset to scan date in months. Disease progression rate was obtained through dividing the ALSFRS scores by disease duration. \n\nThe control group was composed of sex and age-matched healthy right-handed individuals, whom were free of neurological or psychiatric diseases as assessed by a neurologist. None of them received psychotropic medication. \n\nThe present study was approved by the local Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Written informed consents were obtained from all subjects. \n\n\n### MRI Acquisition \n  \nMRI was performed on a 3.0 Tesla (T) MR imaging System (Excite; GE, Milwaukee, WI) by using an eight-channel phased-array head coil. High resolution T1-weighted images were acquired via a volumetric three-dimensional spoiled gradient recall sequence (TR\u200a=\u200a8.5 msec, echo time\u200a=\u200a3.4 msec, flip angle\u200a=\u200a12\u00b0, slice thickness\u200a=\u200a1 mm). Field of view (240\u00d7240 mm ) was used with an acquisition matrix comprising 256 readings of 128 phase encoding steps that produced 156 contiguous coronal slices, with a slice thickness of 1.0 mm. The final matrix size of T1-weighted images was automatically interpolated in-plane to 512\u00d7512, which yielded an in-plane resolution of 0.47\u00d70.47 mm . MR images sensitized to changes in BOLD signal levels (TR\u200a=\u200a2000 msec, echo time\u200a=\u200a30 msec, flip angle\u200a=\u200a90\u00b0) were obtained via a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence (EPI). The slice thickness was 5 mm (no slice gap) with a matrix size of 64\u00d764 and a field of view of 240\u00d7240 mm , resulting in a voxel size of 3.75\u00d73.75\u00d75 mm . Each brain volume comprised 30 axial slices and each functional run contained 200 image volumes. The fMRI scanning was performed in darkness, and the participants were explicitly instructed to relax, close their eyes and not fall asleep (confirmed by subjects immediately after the experiment) during the resting-state MR acquisition. Ear plugs were used to reduce scanner noise, and head motion was minimized by stabilizing the head with cushions. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Analysis \n  \nFunctional image preprocessing and statistical analysis was carried out using the SPM8 (Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK;  ). The first ten volumes of functional images were discarded for the signal equilibrium and participants\u2019 adaptation to scanning noise. Then, the remaining EPI images were preprocessed using the following steps: slice timing, motion correction, spatial normalization to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) EPI template in SPM8 and resample to 3\u00d73\u00d73 mm , followed by spatial smoothing with 8-mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. According to the record of head motions within each fMRI run, all participants had less than 2 mm maximum displacement in the x, y, or z plane and less than 1\u00b0 of angular rotation about each axis. \n\nALFF was calculated using REST   ( ) with a voxel-based approach similar to that used in earlier studies  ,  . After preprocessing, the time series for each voxel was filtered (band pass, 0.01\u20130.08 Hz)   to remove the effects of very-low-frequency drift and high frequency noise, e.g., respiratory and heart rhythms. Then, the filtered time series was transformed to a frequency domain using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) (parameters: taper percent\u200a=\u200a0, FFT length\u200a=\u200ashortest) and the power spectrum was then obtained by square-rooted FFT and averaged across 0.01\u20130.08 Hz at each voxel. This averaged square root was taken as the ALFF. For standardization purposes, the ALFF of each voxel was divided by the global mean ALFF value to standardize data across subjects. \n\n\n### VBM Analysis \n  \nRecent studies of fMRI have suggested that functional results could potentially be influenced by structural differences among groups  . To explore the possible effect, we performed a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis for structural images. In this study, we used the diffeomorphic anatomic registration through an exponentiated lie algebra algorithm (DARTEL)   to improve the registration of the MRI images. DARTEL has been shown to be more sensitive than standard VBM methods  . Before segmentation, we checked for scanner artifacts and gross anatomical abnormalities for each subject; and the image origin was set to the anterior commissure. Then, MR images were segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid using the unified segmentation model in SPM8  . In a next step, a GM template was generated through an iteratively nonlinear registration (DARTEL;  ). The GM template was normalized to MNI space and the resulting deformations were applied to the GM images of each participant. Finally, spatially normalized images were modulated to ensure that the overall amount of each tissue class was not altered by the spatial normalization procedure, and smoothed with an 8-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nTwo-sample t-tests were performed to assess the differences in age, sex and handedness between ALS patients and controls, A two-tailed   p   value of <0.05 was deemed significant. \n\nThe differences of voxel-based ALFF between ALS patients and controls were analyzed using SPM8 with a two-sample t-test. Significant differences were set at the threshold of voxel-wise t>3.32 (P<0.001) and cluster level of p<0.05 corrected by family-wise error (FWE) correction. The MNI coordinates were transformed to Talairach coordinates using mni2tal. The results were presented using the voxel of peak significance. \n\nVoxel-based comparisons of gray matter volume were performed between groups using two sample t-tests with total intracranial volume as covariates. The significance of group differences was set at the threshold of voxel-wise T>3.32 (p<0.001) and cluster level of p<0.05 corrected by FWE correction. \n\nFurthermore, we reanalyzed the difference of ALFF between two groups by entering the GM probability maps as voxel-wise covariates   using the Biological Parametric Mapping toolbox   ( ). \n\nThe average ALFF of all voxels in the abnormal areas revealed by voxel-based analysis was extracted separately using the volume of interest (VOI) in SPM8. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate the relationship between clinical variables (disease duration, disease progression rate and ALSFRS scores) and the mean ALFF within the VOIs, and the significance was set at P<0.05 (two-tailed). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nDemographic and clinical data for ALS patients and controls were given in  . There were no significant differences in age, gender and handedness between the two groups. \n   Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of ALS Patients and Control Subjects.        \nBy using voxel-based analysis without taking regional GM volume as covariates, compared to the controls, the ALS patients showed significantly decreased ALFF in the inferior occipital lobe, fusiform gyri, and right postcentral gyrus. Significantly increased ALFF were found in the left middle frontal gyrus. The peak voxels within those significant different clusters were shown in    and    .  \n   Differences in the spatial patterns of ALFF.  \n(A) ALFF differences between ALS and control groups without GM correction. There were significant decreased ALFF in visual cortex, fusiform gyrus and right postcentral gyrus, as well as increased ALFF in left middle frontal lobe. (B) ALFF differences between ALS and control groups with GM correction. There were significant decreased ALFF in visual cortex, fusiform gyrus and right postcentral gyrus, as well as increased ALFF in left middle frontal lobe and right inferior frontal gyrus. There were some slight changes after GM correction. For instance, after GM correction, the increased intrinsic brain activities in right inferior frontal gyrus reached significant level (marked by red arrow). Green indicates that ALS patients had decreased ALFF compared with the controls and the red indicates the opposite. The statistical threshold was set at voxel-wise t>3.32 (P<0.001) and cluster level of p<0.05 corrected by FWE. \n     Regions Showing Significantly changed ALFF value in ALS Patients.        \nIn the VBM analysis, no GM volume difference reached the significant level. While taking regional GM volume as covariates, we found that the results of ALFF were approximately consistent with those without GM correction. However, we also noted that the significant level and cluster size were slightly changed after GM correction. Besides, after GM correction, the increased intrinsic brain activities in right inferior frontal gyrus reached significant level   (Details in    ,   ). \n\nIn ALS patients, a moderate positive correlation was identified between disease duration and the mean ALFF in the left MFG (r\u200a=\u200a\u22120.480, p\u200a=\u200a0.038,  ), while the rate of disease progression was negatively correlated with the mean ALFF in the left middle frontal gyrus (r\u200a=\u200a0.452, p\u200a=\u200a0.045,  ). However, there was no significant correlation between the disease severity (ALSFRS scores) and the mean ALFF in the VOIs. \n   Correlations between ALFF value in left middle frontal gyrus and clinical measurements.  \nLeft middle frontal gyrus shows increased ALFF and scatter plots show correlations between ALFF of this area and disease progression rate and disease duration in the ALS group. \n  \n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we applied ALFF measurement to conduct a whole brain voxel-based analysis of cerebral function during the resting state, and our results revealed the abnormal neural activity outside the motor cortex in ALS patients which remained approximately consistent after controlling for the structural difference. Specifically, we found reduced ALFF in the inferior occipital lobe, bilateral fusiform gyri, and postcentral gyrus, while increased ALFF was found in left middle frontal gyrus, and in right inferior frontal gyrus after GM correction. Additionally, the ALFF value of the left middle frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with disease progression rate and positively correlated with disease duration. Our results suggest that the ALFF measurement of intrinsic brain activity could be useful to characterize the physiology of ALS. \n\nAbnormal brain activities in the sensorymotor cortex have been consistently observed by position emission tomography (PET) studies  ,   or fMRI studies  ,  ,  ,  . Reduced grey matter volume identified in this area  ,   provided structural basis for the above findings. Our finding that ALS patients showed decreased ALFF in the postcentral gyrus was in line with these previous studies. Given that ALS is a degeneration disease predominantly affecting motor system, this alteration seems to reflect dysfunction in motor system in ALS patients. However, on the other hand, previous clinical observation studies  ,  \u2013 , electrophysiological studies ,  \u2013 , and neuropathological studies  ,   have provided pathologic evidence for abnormalities in the sensory system. Since the peak voxel is located in postcentral gyrus\u2013\u2013the main sensory receptive area for the sense of touch, it is possible that this alteration may reflect the dysfunction in sensory system. \n\nMoreover, more widely decreased ALFF was found in the visual processing areas: the inferior occipital lobe and fusiform gyri. This finding suggests a disturbance of visual process, which is in accordance with previous electrophysiological studies and task-related fMRI studies. A reduced and delayed response to visual stimuli was observed in sensory cortical processing areas in ALS patients by electrophysiological studies  ,  , and progressive reduced activation of extrastriate areas over the course of ALS was identified by a previous longitudinal study  . Combining fMRI with structural MRI, researchers demonstrated the existence of a decreased response in secondary visual areas in ALS during visual stimulation, and significantly less functional white fiber tracts projecting to visual areas  . Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that abnormalities in visual processing areas can be caused by the demyelination of nerve fibers in the optic tract  . \n\nOn the whole, the decreased ALFF in the inferior occipital lobe, bilateral fusiform gyri and the right postcentral gyrus detected in the current study may suggest functional deficits in the sensory system of ALS. However, the decreased activities in the sensory system could also be a result of attenuated afferent peripheral inflow caused by progressive immobility in ALS  . It is unclear whether the progressive functional deficit in secondary/higher order sensory processing areas in ALS is a specific event in the expression of this disease process, or just an unspecific reaction to the reduction of external information flow. Future longitudinal studies on ALS are needed to clarify this question. \n\nApart from the reduced intrinsic activities, increased activities have been observed in the left middle frontal gyrus in our ALS patients. Besides, after GM correction, we noticed the increased intrinsic brain activities in right inferior fontal gyrus reached significance. Similarly, in a PET study  , poor cognitive performance was associated with decreased binding in left middle frontal gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus, indicating those areas playing an important role in the cognitive function. These increased activities in these areas are likely to reflect the compensatory process for dysfunction of frontoparietal network, which has been suggested to be related to cognitive function and be disrupted in ALS patients by a recent fMRI study  . In the early stages of ALS, the compensatory mechanism may temporarily \u201ccover\u201d the functional deficits. The patients in the present study were at a relatively early stage of the disease; this might explain why we didn\u2019t found wide spread decreased brain activities in other frontal areas or motor areas. However, the compensatory mechanism is limited and might be exhausted with the increasing burden of disease pathology  . In more advanced patients, we anticipate that ALFF alterations will be more spread out in motor and frontal areas. This needs future longitudinal study to elucidate. \n\nThe negative correlation between the rate of disease progression and the ALFF value in the left middle frontal gyrus also gives support to the hypothesis that the increased brain activities in the left middle frontal gyrus act in a compensatory role. More wide-spread frontal lobe dysfunction could hinder the compensatory the process, which is supported by the fact that co-occurrence of frontotemporal dementia and even executive dysfunction are unfavorable prognostic factors in ALS  . This indicates that the ALFF value in the left middle frontal gyrus may be a quantitative marker in predicting the prognosis of ALS in the early stages of the disease. \n\nNo relation was found between the disease severity, measured by the ALSFRS, and the ALFF value in the abnormal brain areas. The reasonable explanations are listed as follows. The lack of objectivity was reported in clinical assessment using ALSFRS which can be masked by lower motor neuron signs  . Furthermore, we chose the ALSFRS instead of the revised vision\u2013\u2013ALSFRS-R  , which incorporates additional assessments of dyspnea, orthopnea, and the need for ventilator support. An objective upper motor neuron measure would contribute to the association between disease severity and ALFF measurements. \n\nAlthough previous VBM studies showed grey matter volume decreased widely, especially in the motor cortex  ,  ,  ,   and frontal and temporal regions  ,  ,  , we didn\u2019t found significant grey matter atrophy in our sample. This may be due to a relatively early stage of our patients. After controlling for the regional grey matter volume, we found that the results of ALFF were slightly changed, but the patterns were approximately consistent with those without GM correction. Clarifying the interaction between structural difference and BOLD signals has been attempted by several recent fMRI studies  ,  ,  . Most of them found that the functional results retained mainly consistent but with changed significance after GM correction. Our results are in accordance with these previous studies and imply ALFF are reliable to reflect the functional abnormalities in intrinsic brain activities in ALS patients. \n\nThere are several limitations in this study. First, the sample size was relatively small, which limits the generalization of the results. A larger group of ALS patients needs to be recruited for long-term longitudinal observation. Second, lack of objective assessment of sensory function and more specific neuropsychological assessment of cognitive function in ALS patients hampers our interpretations of the results. Further investigations should be focused on the relationship between sensory deficits and abnormal spontaneous activity in the sensory cortex. \n\nIn conclusion, our observations confirmed the abnormal spontaneous brain activity in the sensorimotor cortex, visual cortex and frontal lobe; supporting the concept that ALS is a multisystem disorder. These observations would also extend the ALS phenotype to include sensory neuropathy. The ALFF value in the left middle frontal gyrus may be a quantitative marker in predicting the ALS prognosis. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone-0045470-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tALS\tControl\tP-value\nN\t20\t20\t\u2212\nGender (male: female)\t13\u223607\t14\u223606\t0.74\nMean age (years)\t45.30\u00b19.95\t47.05\u00b19.89\t0.58\nHandedness for writing (R:L)\t20\u223600\t20\u223600\t\u2013\nSite of onset (bulbar: cervical: lumbar)\t4\u223610:06\t\u2013\t\u2013\nMean age of onset (years)\t44.69\u00b110.18\t\u2013\t\u2013\nMean disease duration (months)\t15.20\u00b110.37\t\u2013\t\u2013\nProgression rate, mean ???\t3.83\u00b12.64\t\u2013\t\u2013\nALSFRS???, mean\t31.85\u00b15.39\t\u2013\t\u2013\n### Caption\nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics of ALS Patients and Control Subjects.\n### Footer\naProgression rate\u200a=\u200a(40-ALSFRS)/disease duration (months).bALSFRS-ALS functional rating scale.\n\n\n## ID: pone-0045470-t002\n### Label: Table 2\nUnnamed: 0\tAnatomic regions\tBrodmann area\tCoordinates of peak voxel(X, Y, Z)???\tMaximum T score\tNumber of voxels\tP-corrected with FWE\nWithoutGMcorrection\tALS>control\tALS>control\tALS>control\tALS>control\tALS>control\tALS>control\n\tFrontal_Mid_L\t46\t\u221229 32 32\t5.58\t52\t0.015\n\tALS<control\tALS<control\tALS<control\tALS<control\tALS<control\tALS<control\n\tPostcentral_R\t3\t49 \u221226 47\t\u22124.85\t45\t0.03\n\tFusifrom\t37\t27 \u221251 \u221211\t\u22125\t60\t0.008\n\tOccipital_Inf\t18/19\t\u221232 \u221282 \u221211\t\u22126.52\t642\t<0.001\nWithGMcorrection\tALS>control\tALS>control\tALS>control\tALS>control\tALS>control\tALS>control\n\tFrontal_Inf_R\t11\t40 33 \u22127\t5.43\t37\t0.012\n\tFrontal_Mid_L\t46\t\u221229 32 32\t6.43\t84\t<0.001\n\tALS<control\tALS<control\tALS<control\tALS<control\tALS<control\tALS<control\n\tPostcentral_R\t3\t49 \u221226 47\t\u22124.96\t36\t0.013\n\tFusifrom\t37\t27 \u221251 \u221211\t\u22125.08\t50\t0.002\n\tOccipital_Inf\t18/19\t\u221232 \u221282 \u221211\t\u22126.28\t522\t<0.001\n### Caption\nRegions Showing Significantly changed ALFF value in ALS Patients.\n### Footer\naX, Y and Z are location of peak voxel in the Talairach\u2013Tournoux coordinate;The statistical threshold was set at voxel-wise t>3.32 (P<0.001) and cluster level of p<0.05 corrected by FWE (family-wise error).\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 3447931, "text_md5": "c3ce7ac2d0130c0786eedf3135b3fbd7", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 143], "journal": [144, 152], "publication_year": [154, 158], "title": [169, 268], "keywords": [282, 282], "abstract": [295, 1969], "body": [1978, 25603], "tables": [25616, 27424]}, "batch": 4, "pmid": 23029031, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0045470", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447931", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3447931"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447931\">3447931</a>", "list_title": "PMC3447931  Patterns of Spontaneous Brain Activity in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Resting-State fMRI Study"}

However, the temporal dynamics of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric functional connectivity patterns remain unknown in schizophrenia patients with AVHs. We analyzed resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging data for drug\u2010na\u00efve first\u2010episode schizophrenia patients, 50 with AVHs and 50 without AVH (NAVH), and 50 age\u2010 and sex\u2010matched healthy controls. Whole\u2010brain functional connectivity was decomposed into ipsilateral and contralateral parts, and sliding\u2010window analysis was used to calculate voxel\u2010wise interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dynamic functional connectivity density (dFCD). Finally, the correlation analysis was performed between abnormal dFCD variance and clinical measures in the AVH and NAVH groups. Compared with the NAVH group and healthy controls, the AVH group showed weaker interhemispheric dFCD variability in the left middle temporal gyrus (  p  \u2009<\u2009.01;   p  \u2009<\u2009.001), as well as stronger interhemispheric dFCD variability in the right thalamus (  p  \u2009<\u2009.001;   p  \u2009<\u2009.001) and right inferior temporal gyrus (  p  \u2009<\u2009.01;   p  \u2009<\u2009.001) and stronger intrahemispheric dFCD variability in the left inferior frontal gyrus (  p  \u2009<\u2009.001;   p  \u2009<\u2009.01). Moreover, abnormal contralateral dFCD variability of the left middle temporal gyrus correlated with the severity of AVHs in the AVH group (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.319,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.024). The findings demonstrate that abnormal temporal variability of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD in schizophrenia patients with AVHs mainly focus on the temporal and frontal cortices and thalamus that are pivotal components of auditory and language pathways. \n  \nHere, we collected and analyzed resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging data for drug\u2010na\u00efve first\u2010episode schizophrenia patients, 50 with auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) and 50 without AVH (NAVH), and 50 age\u2010 and sex\u2010matched healthy controls. Whole\u2010brain functional connectivity was decomposed into ipsilateral and contralateral functional connectivity, and sliding\u2010window analysis was used to calculate the interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dynamic functional connectivity density (dFCD). The findings demonstrate that abnormal temporal variability of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD in schizophrenia patients with AVHs mainly focuses on the temporal and frontal cortices and thalamus that are pivotal components of auditory and language pathways.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nAuditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) are a prominent symptom of schizophrenia and affect approximately 60%\u201380% of patients (Bauer et al.,\u00a0 ). AVHs are defined as hearing and perceiving voices in the absence of an external auditory stimulus. Based on the technology of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), recent findings suggested that AVHs might be traced back to abnormally intrinsic functional organizations involving multiple brain regions and networks (Cui et al.,\u00a0 ; Hoffman et al.,\u00a0 ; Kumari et al.,\u00a0 ; Northoff & Qin,\u00a0 ; Scheinost et al.,\u00a0 ; Silbersweig et al.,\u00a0 ; Simons et al.,\u00a0 ; Stripeikyte et al.,\u00a0 ). Although multiple existing conceptual models of AVHs, such as top\u2010down and bottom\u2010up\u00a0(Hugdahl,\u00a0 ), corollary discharge (Ford et al.,\u00a0 ), nondominant language intrusion (Sommer et al.,\u00a0 ; van Lutterveld et al.,\u00a0 ), and interhemispheric miscommunication (Curcic\u2010Blake et al.,\u00a0 ; Gavrilescu et al.,\u00a0 ), were indicated by the previous studies, it is unclear which model is the most relevant for AVHs. \n\nA large number of resting\u2010state fMRI studies indicate abnormal local and long\u2010range connectivity in AVHs (Chang et al.,\u00a0 ;C. Chen, Wang, et al.,\u00a0 ; Hare et al.,\u00a0 ; Mondino et al.,\u00a0 ; Zhuo et al.,\u00a0 ). Local functional connectivity was usually estimated using regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis, and long\u2010range connectivity was usually estimated using resting\u2010state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis (Hare et al.,\u00a0 ). On the one hand, the researchers, respectively, explored local and long\u2010range connectivity and found abnormal local and long\u2010range connectivity mainly in the frontal and temporal language\u2010related areas (Chang et al.,\u00a0 ; Hoffman & Hampson,\u00a0 ; Vercammen et al.,\u00a0 ; Wolf et al.,\u00a0 ; Zheng et al.,\u00a0 ; Zhuo et al.,\u00a0 ). On the other hand, Chen, Wang, et al.\u00a0( ), Chen, Cui, et al.\u00a0( ), and Cui et al.\u00a0( ), respectively, utilized both the two measurements and found that schizophrenia patients with AVHs showed stronger ReHo in the putamen and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and weaker rsFC between the putamen and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Moreover, structure functional analysis also indicated stronger interhemispheric auditory connectivity in schizophrenia patients with AVHs (Mulert et al.,\u00a0 ; Steinmann et al.,\u00a0 ). Chang et al.\u00a0( ) adopted a newly developed index, voxel\u2010mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), to quantitatively describe interhemispheric functional connectivity, and showed aberrant bilateral connectivity of default mode network (DMN), IFG, and cerebellum in the AVH group. These inconsistent findings mean that it is important and necessary to investigate abnormal interhemispheric and intrahemispheric functional connectivity in AVHs across the board using a better approach. The analysis of functional connectivity density (FCD) represents the number of connections between voxels throughout the global or interhemispheric and intrahemispheric brain and is a data\u2010driven graph theory method, which can identify the distribution of highly connected hubs in brain networks (Bullmore & Sporns,\u00a0 ; Lee et al.,\u00a0 ; J. Zhu et al.,\u00a0 ). To the best of our knowledge, the previous studies adopted FCD to explore altered voxel\u2010wise interhemispheric and intrahemispheric functional connectivity in schizophrenia patients (Agcaoglu et al.,\u00a0 ; Y. Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ; F. Zhu et al.,\u00a0 ; F. Zhu et al.,\u00a0 ) but not in AVHs. The previous studies only found abnormal ROI\u2010wise interhemispheric connections between auditory and language\u2010related areas (Curcic\u2010Blake et al.,\u00a0 ; Gavrilescu et al.,\u00a0 ). The language, auditory, and memory/limbic networks are of particular relevance for AVHs (\u0106ur\u010di\u0107\u2010Blake et al.,\u00a0 ). Therefore, voxel\u2010wise interhemispheric and intrahemispheric FCD might be necessary to identify the distribution of highly connected hubs in abnormal brain networks for AVHs. \n\nThe above abnormal connections in schizophrenia patients with AVHs are static. The traditional functional connectivity, including interhemispheric and intrahemispheric parts, is based on the implicit assumption of spatial and temporal stationary of fMRI data, which is over simple for complex activities of the human brain (Allen et al.,\u00a0 ). When the mental activity is unconstrained, dynamics are potentially even more prominent under the resting state. Evidence suggested that dynamic functional connectivity supply us new information about abnormal functional connectivity on the brain of patients with various diseases (Chen et al.,\u00a0 ; Y. Chen, Cui, et al.,\u00a0 ; Demirta\u015f et al.,\u00a0 ; Y. Li et al.,\u00a0 ; R. Wang, Sun, et al.,\u00a0 ; J. Zhu et al.,\u00a0 ). Previous findings showed altered dynamic functional connectivity in the DMN and the language network in schizophrenia patients with AVHs (Geng et al.,\u00a0 ; Weber et al.,\u00a0 ; W. Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ). Moreover, Guo et al.\u00a0( ) explored altered temporal variability of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dynamic FCD (dFCD) using a sliding window approach in autism spectrum disorder, and the interhemispheric and intrahemispheric FCD were discomposed from the whole\u2010brain FCD. Although numerous studies explored the neural mechanism of AVHs, it was unclear whether schizophrenia patients with AVHs exhibited abnormal intrahemispheric and interhemispheric dFCD. \n\nIn this study, we explored the temporal variability of voxel\u2010wise contralateral and ipsilateral dFCD, denoting the interhemispheric and intrahemispheric parts, in drug\u2010na\u00efve first\u2010episode schizophrenia (FES) patients with AVHs. The intrahemispheric and interhemispheric of the dFCD were further quantified using the standard deviation of dFCD variance patterns across time. Then, we compared the temporal changes of the intrahemispheric and interhemispheric dFCD between schizophrenia patients with AVHs and without AVH (NAVH) and healthy subjects. Moreover, the correlation analysis was performed between clinical measures with significant results between groups. In this study, we aimed to find abnormal temporal variability of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD in schizophrenia patients with AVHs and hypothesized that these might be exhibited in the pivotal components of auditory and language pathways. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study randomly recruited 100 drug\u2010na\u00efve FES patients and 50 age\u2010 and sex\u2010matched healthy controls (HCs) (Table\u00a0 ). All patients did not take any antipsychotic drugs. Schizophrenia diagnosis by a psychiatric specialist was made using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM\u2010IV). The illness duration of all patients was less than 3\u2009years, and the diapause was less than 6\u00a0months. Symptom severity of schizophrenia was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Fifty patients reported experiencing AVHs within the past 4\u2009weeks, most within the past week, while the other 50 patients reported no AVH in their lifetime or in the past 4\u00a0months. This was based on the PANSS scores at the time of screening, as well as detailed information regarding past symptomatology that was acquired in patient interviews and examination of the patients' medical records. The severity of AVHs was assessed using the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS). Eleven patients reported that the voices appeared at least once a week; the other 39 patients reported hearing these voices at least once a day. Twelve patients reported that the voices continued for several seconds at a time; 26 patients reported voices lasting several minutes; 5 patients reported voices lasting more than an hour; and 7 patients reported that the voices could continue for several hours at a time. We collected PANSS data for 33 of the AVH patients and for all NAVH patients and collected AHRS data for all AVH patients. All participants were right handed. Exclusion criteria for all participants were as follows: (1) contraindications for MRI, (2) alcohol or drug abuse, and (3) severe physical disability or traumatic head injury. HCs had no history of neurological or psychiatric illness. All subjects gave the informed consent, and this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. \n  \nThe demographic and clinical data of schizophrenia patients, with and without AVH, and healthy controls \n    \n\n### Data acquisition \n  \nAll subjects were scanned using a 3.0\u00a0T MRI scanner (Discovery MR750, GE, USA) with an eight\u2010channel receiver array head coil. Head motion and scanner noise were reduced using foam padding and earplugs. All participants were asked to remain alert with their eyes closed. We collected MRI data from all participants. Structural images were acquired using a 3D T1 BRAVO sequence with the following settings: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)\u00a0=\u00a08.2/3.2\u00a0ms, slice number\u00a0=\u00a0188, slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a01\u2009mm, slice gap\u00a0=\u00a00\u2009mm, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a012\u00b0, field of view (FOV)\u00a0=\u00a025.6\u2009\u00d7\u200925.6\u00a0cm , number of averages\u00a0=\u00a01, matrix size\u00a0=\u00a0256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, voxel size\u00a0=\u00a01\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm , scan time\u00a0=\u00a04.33\u2009min. Functional images were acquired transversely with gradient spin echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following settings: TR/TE\u00a0=\u00a02000/30\u2009ms, slice number\u00a0=\u00a032, slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a04\u2009mm, slice gap\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u2009mm, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0, FOV\u00a0=\u00a022\u2009\u00d7\u200922\u2009cm , number of averages\u00a0=\u00a01, matrix size\u00a0=\u00a064\u2009\u00d7\u200964, voxel size\u00a0=\u00a03.4375\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4375\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009mm . A total of 180 volumes were collected, resulting in a total scan time of 6\u00a0min. The patients in the AVH group reported that they experienced no hallucinations during scanning, and all participants also reported that they were alert in the scanning session. \n\n\n### Data preprocessing \n  \nData were preprocessed using Data Processing Assistant for Resting\u2010State fMRI (DPARSF) programs, which are based on Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) and MATLAB (MathWorks). The first five volumes were discarded due to unsteady magnetization. Slice\u2010timing and realignment were performed. We excluded the subjects whose head motion with translational or rotational motion was higher than 3\u2009mm or 3\u00b0, and three patients in the NAVH group were excluded. Then, data were spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute template (resampling voxel size\u00a0=\u00a03\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm ), detrended, and filtered (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz). Image volumes with framewise displacement (FD) >0.2\u2009mm were scrubbed to reduce the effect of head motion using spline interpolation (He et al.,\u00a0 ). In this study, we failed to find significant differences in FD between groups (  F  \u00a0=\u00a00.302,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.740). Nuisance covariates were regressed, including Friston 24 head motion (Friston et al.,\u00a0 )\u00a0parameters and white matter and cerebrospinal fluid signals). The global signal was not regressed out as has been recently suggested (Yang et al.,\u00a0 ) when processing functional data from patients with schizophrenia. \n\n\n###  dFCD   estimation and temporal variability \n  \nGlobal, contralateral, and ipsilateral dFCD were computed using a sliding\u2010window method. The length of the window we set was 50 TRs (He et al.,\u00a0 ; R. Li et al.,\u00a0 ), and this window was used to slide on the time course with a step of 1 TR (2\u2009s). In total, 126 (175\u201350\u2009+\u20091) temporal windows were produced, then we calculated FCD for each window. We first calculated the global FCD for each window as the mean number of functional connectivity between one voxel (seed) and other voxels (target voxels) in the whole brain. The global FCD was limited voxels within the gray matter template. Functional connectivity between voxels was calculated using Pearson's correlation, with a correlation coefficient threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05, uncorrected. Then we discomposed the global FCD into contralateral and ipsilateral FCD based on the relative positions of seed and target voxels. Contralateral (interhemispheric) FCD at each voxel referred to the number of functional connectivity with all voxels in the opposite hemisphere, and ipsilateral (intrahemispheric) FCD at each voxel referred to the number of functional connectivity with all voxels in the same hemisphere. To examine the reproducibility of our findings, we repeated our findings with different window lengths (30 TRs and 80 TRs), correlation thresholds (  p  \u2009<\u2009.01 and   p  \u2009<\u2009.001) and shifting step (2 TRs) (Figures S ). We employed one common metric to describe its dynamic characteristics in global, contralateral, and ipsilateral dFCD that was the standard deviation of the dFCD variance patterns over time. After that,   Z  \u2010transformed dFCD variance maps were obtained and spatially smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian kernel (full width at half maximum [FWHM]\u00a0=\u00a06\u2009mm). \n\nWhen we set the window length as 175 TRs, global, contralateral, and ipsilateral static FCD (sFCD) was obtained in accordance with FCD analysis for each window. For comparing with dFCD, we also calculated sFCD using Pearson's correlation, with a correlation coefficient threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05, uncorrected. Finally,   Z  \u2010transformed connectivity maps were also obtained and were spatially smoothed (6\u2009mm). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nOne\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA), two\u2010sample   t   test, and   \u03c7   tests were, respectively, used to compare demographic data between groups with SPSS software. One\u2010way ANOVA was also performed to compare the group differences in global, contralateral, and ipsilateral dFCD variances and sFCD between the AVH, NAVH, and HC groups, with age, sex and mean FD as covariates. The statistically significant threshold was set at voxel\u2010wise   p  \u2009<\u2009.001, cluster\u2010wise   p  \u2009<\u2009.05, and the minimum cluster size of 19 voxels after Gaussian random field (GRF) correction. We extracted the average dFCD variance or sFCD values of all voxels within each cluster from corrected statistical maps and performed post hoc comparisons using Bonferroni's test. Moreover, the correlation analysis was performed for clinical measures with significant results between groups. Multiple comparisons were corrected using the Bonferroni method (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05/92\u00a0=\u00a0.0005). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Demographic and clinical data \n  \nNo significant between\u2010group differences in age or sex were found, and no significant between\u2010group differences in PANSS total, positive, negative, or general scores between the AVH and NAVH groups, except for hallucination scores (Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n###  dFCD   variance \n  \nThe mean global, contralateral, and ipsilateral dFCD variance maps for the HC, AVH, and NAVH groups were presented in Figure\u00a0 . DFCD variance patterns in the HC group were maximal in the bilateral superior and middle temporal gyri, medial part of bilateral superior frontal gyri, bilateral middle and inferior occipital gyri, bilateral lingual and fusiform gyri, left IFG, whereas minimal in the right inferior parietal lobe, bilateral subcortical regions (thalamus, caudate, and hippocampus). \n  \nAverage dynamic functional connectivity density (dFCD) variance for healthy controls (HCs) and schizophrenia patients with auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) and without auditory verbal hallucination (NAVH) \n  \nOne\u2010way ANOVA revealed significant between\u2010group differences in global dFCD variance in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), left IFG and medial dorsal (MD) nuclei of the bilateral thalami, contralateral dFCD variance in the left MTG, anterior nucleus (AN) of the right thalamus and right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), and ipsilateral dFCD variance in the left MTG and left IFG (Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 , left). We extracted global, contralateral, and ipsilateral dFCD variance values for each subject in the above regions that had significant between\u2010group differences and performed one\u2010way ANOVA followed by post hoc comparisons using Bonferroni's test. Compared with the HC group, the AVH and NAVH groups showed weaker global and ipsilateral dFCD variances in the left MTG and stronger global dFCD variance mainly in the MD nuclei of the bilateral thalami (Figure\u00a0 , right). Compared with the HC and NAVH groups, the AVH group showed stronger global and ipsilateral dFCD variances in the left IFG, stronger contralateral dFCD variance in the AD of the right thalamus and right ITG and weaker contralateral dFCD variance in the left MTG (Figure\u00a0 , right). Moreover, compared with the HC group, the NAVH group showed weaker global and ipsilateral dFCD variances in the left IFG (Figure\u00a0 , right). \n  \nBetween\u2010group differences in the global, contralateral, and ipsilateral dFCD variances \n      \nBetween\u2010group differences for global, contralateral and ipsilateral dFCD variances.

Compared with the NAVH and HC groups, the AVH group showed weaker interhemispheric dFCD variability in the left MTG, as well as stronger interhemispheric dFCD variability in the right ITG and the AN of the right thalamus and stronger intrahemispheric dFCD variability in the left IFG. Both the AVH and NAVH groups showed weaker intrahemispheric dFCD variability in the left MTG than the HC group. Moreover, abnormal contralateral dFCD variance of the left MTG correlated with the severity of auditory hallucinations in the AVH group. These findings help us further understanding the abnormal functional connectivity in AVHs. \n\nOur findings showed some pattern in interhemispheric and intrahemispheric FCD abnormalities in drug\u2010na\u00efve FES patients with AVHs, which further supported the findings of abnormal local and long\u2010range connectivity in the previous studies (Chang et al.,\u00a0 ; C. Chen, Wang, et al.,\u00a0 ; Hare et al.,\u00a0 ; Mondino et al.,\u00a0 ; Zhuo et al.,\u00a0 ). It suggests the importance to consider the factors of topological location and anatomical distance in future research investigating abnormal brain network in AVHs. Moreover, we explored voxel\u2010wise interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD variances and sFCD in drug\u2010na\u00efve FES patients with AVHs. In our previous study, we investigated voxel\u2010wise resting\u2010state functional connectivity of the thalamic nucleus in drug\u2010na\u00efve FES patients with AVHs and found that the critical structure in the thalamus underlying AVHs is the PuM nucleus, and the DM nucleus and AN of the thalamus dysconnectivity are specific for schizophrenia, but not AVHs (Wei et al.,\u00a0 ). Here, we found abnormal interhemispheric dFCD variance of the thalamic AN in AVHs and abnormal dFCD and sFCD of the bilateral thalamic DM nuclei in drug\u2010na\u00efve FES patients. Therefore, dynamic functional connection or a combination of static and dynamic functional connectome approaches may provide more evidence for the neural substrate of AVHs. \n\nSimilar to global FCD, contralateral and ipsilateral FCD show interhemispheric and intrahemispheric functional hubs in the neural networks (Guo et al.,\u00a0 ; Tomasi & Volkow,\u00a0 ,  ). The AVH group showed abnormal interhemispheric and/or intrahemispheric dFCD variability in the left MTG, left IFG, right ITG, and AN of the right thalamus. The upper regions are the pivotal components of auditory and language pathways (Acheson & Hagoort,\u00a0 ; Nauchi & Sakai,\u00a0 ; Opitz et al.,\u00a0 ; Wahl et al.,\u00a0 ) and highly associate with the neural mechanism of AVHs (Shergill et al.,\u00a0 ; Silbersweig et al.,\u00a0 ; Vercammen et al.,\u00a0 ; Wei et al.,\u00a0 ). Abnormal activations and connectivity in auditory and language pathways have highly linked to schizophrenia patients with AVHs (Benetti et al.,\u00a0 ; Chang et al.,\u00a0 ; Lavigne & Woodward,\u00a0 ; Steinmann et al.,\u00a0 ; Xie et al.,\u00a0 ). Our findings also indicated that interhemispheric dFCD variance could clearly distinguish the AVH group from the NAVH and HC groups. Moreover, the interhemispheric dFCD variance of the MTG correlated with the AHRS scores and PANSS general symptom scores. Our previous findings indicated aberrant cerebello\u2010thalamo\u2010cortical functional and effective connectivity in drug\u2010na\u00efve FES patients with AVHs, and the cortex also included the MTG and IFG (Wei et al.,\u00a0 ). A significant deficit in the static interhemispheric and intrahemispheric connectivity in the left MTG was revealed in schizophrenia (Y. Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ), which is similar to our findings. The previous study also indicated that aberrant bilateral static interhemispheric dysconnectivity of the IFG might contribute to the occurrence of AVHs (Chang et al.,\u00a0 ). The previous studies utilized the parameter of asymmetry (PAS) (static interhemispheric functional connectivity subtracts static intrahemispheric functional connectivity) to describe functional asymmetry, and reduced PAS scores of the MTG was found in schizophrenia patients and unaffected siblings compared with healthy subjects (F. Zhu et al.,\u00a0 ). Abnormal activations and connectivity in these regions might be the core neurobiological markers of auditory and language impairments in schizophrenia patients with AVHs (Hashimoto et al.,\u00a0 ; Hoffman & Hampson,\u00a0 ; Lavigne & Woodward,\u00a0 ). From a dynamic perspective, our present findings supplement evidence for the neural mechanism of AVHs and provide sensitive views of the temporal variability changes of functional connection hubs that may be masked in conventional static studies. The previous and present studies consistently demonstrate the important role of the auditory and language pathways associated with the MTG, IFG, and thalamus in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AVHs. \n\nThe findings of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD for AVHs also support hybrid models of AVH (i.e., top\u2010down and bottom\u2010up, corollary discharge, nondominant language intrusion, and interhemispheric miscommunication) that was overviewed by \u0106ur\u010di\u0107\u2010Blake et al.\u00a0( ). Part of our findings might support one of the above\u2010mentioned models, and another part of our findings might support anther model. First, abnormal interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD of the MTG might correspond to impaired bottom\u2010up sensory processing (perception deficit) and abnormal interhemispheric dFCD of the thalamus and intrahemispheric dFCD of the IFG might correspond to impaired top\u2010down prior expectation (attention deficit), which might also suggest the imbalance in top\u2010down/bottom\u2010up influences (Hugdahl,\u00a0 ). Second, abnormal intrahemispheric dFCD of the MTG and IFG might also correspond to impaired corollary discharge. The previous studies showed deficient corollary discharge in schizophrenia patients with AVHs (Ford et al.,\u00a0 ) and indicated that fronto\u2010temporal transcranial direct current stimulation improved corollary discharge function in schizophrenia (Bose et al.,\u00a0 ). Third, our findings also showed abnormal interhemispheric dFCD and intrahemispheric sFCD in nondominant language areas, such as the right ITG and IFG, which was similar to the previous studies (Sommer et al.,\u00a0 ; van Lutterveld et al.,\u00a0 ). Finally, our findings directly support interhemispheric miscommunication (Curcic\u2010Blake et al.,\u00a0 ; Gavrilescu et al.,\u00a0 ). Compared with the NAVH and HC groups, the AVH group showed weaker interhemispheric dFCD variability in the left MTG, as well as stronger interhemispheric dFCD variability in the right thalamus and ITG. \n\nWe also investigated abnormal interhemispheric and intrahemispheric sFCD in drug\u2010na\u00efve FES patients with AVHs. The findings showed higher interhemispheric and intrahemispheric sFCD on the DM nuclei of bilateral thalami in drug\u2010na\u00efve FES patients with AVHs and NAVH and weaker intrahemispheric sFCD on the right IFG in patients with AVHs. As an important component of aberrant neural circuitry in schizophrenia, the gray matter volume of the DM nucleus of the thalamus is impaired in schizophrenia (Gilbert et al.,\u00a0 ; Sui et al.,\u00a0 ), higher functional connection might be a compensatory response to structural impairments. Moreover, the previous studies found reduced PAS scores of the thalamus and IFG was found in schizophrenia patients and ultra\u2010high risk for psychosis (F. Zhu et al.,\u00a0 ). However, we found opposite pattern between the whole\u2010brain and intrahemispheric dFCD variances and sFCD in drug\u2010na\u00efve FES patients with AVHs or NAVH, which is consistent with the findings in the previous study exploring the neural substrates of other neurological diseases, such as bipolar depression and major depressive disorders (Pang et al.,\u00a0 ), generalized anxiety disorder (Lu et al.,\u00a0 ), and Parkinson's disease (S. Wang, Cai, et al.,\u00a0 ). Higher dFCD may reflect the indicative of flexible communication, but it may also be a sign of unstable interactions (S. Wang, Cai, et al.,\u00a0 ). And weaker sFCD may be the result of unstable interactions. \n\nSeveral limitations should be noted when interpreting our findings. First, although we designed three groups that included 50 subjects for each group, the sample size is small. The future study should increase the sample size to make the findings more reliable. Second, we showed abnormal interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD in drug\u2010na\u00efve FES patients with AVHs, but how temporal dynamics of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD develop in other illness stage was unclear. The interhemispheric connectivity between posterior auditory regions may depend on the phase of illness, with increases in nonpsychotic individuals and FES patients and decreases in chronic patients (\u0106ur\u010di\u0107\u2010Blake et al.,\u00a0 ). The future study should explore whether the illness stage affect interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD in AVHs. Third, we collected resting\u2010state fMRI data, and it remains unknown whether abnormal interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD in AVHs associated with impaired auditory processing. Future task state fMRI studies are needed to examine the association between interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD variability and auditory cognitive function. \n\nIn conclusion, the findings demonstrate that abnormal temporal variability of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD in drug\u2010na\u00efve FES patients with AVHs mainly focuses on interhemispheric pattern in temporal cortex and thalamus and intrahemispheric pattern in the frontal cortex, and these regions are pivotal components of auditory and language pathways. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nAll authors declared no conflict of interest. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: hbm25958-tbl-0001\n### Label: TABLE 1\nUnnamed: 0\tAVH\tNAVH\tHC\tF/X2/t values\tp values\nAge (SD, n\u00a0=\u00a050)\t21.3 (7.7)\t21.9 (7.2)\t22.0 (7.7)\t0.130\t.871\nSex (M/F, n\u00a0=\u00a050)\t24/26\t25/25\t24/26\t0.053\t.974\nAHRS (SD, n\u00a0=\u00a050)\t23.86 (5.99)\t\u2010\t\u2010\t\u2010\t\u2010\nPANSS (SD) (AVH: n\u00a0=\u00a033; NAVH: n\u00a0=\u00a050)\t\t\t\t\t\nPANSS total\t83.3 (14.6)\t83.0 (14.8)\t\u2010\t0.098\t.922\nPANSS positive\t20.3 (5.4)\t19.2 (6.3)\t\u2010\t0.774\t.441\nPANSS negative\t20.8 (4.8)\t21.1 (5.7)\t\u2010\t\u22120.209\t.835\nPANSS general\t42.2 (7.5)\t42.6 (7.9)\t\u2010\t\u22120.264\t.793\nPANSS hallucinations\t4.1 (1.5)\t2.2 (1.5)\t\u2010\t5.041\t.00002\n### Caption\nThe demographic and clinical data of schizophrenia patients, with and without AVH, and healthy controls\n### Footer\nAbbreviations: AHRS, Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale; AVH, auditory verbal hallucination; F, female; HC, healthy control; M, male; NAVH, without auditory verbal hallucination; PANSS, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.\n\n\n## ID: hbm25958-tbl-0002\n### Label: TABLE 2\ndFCD variance\tRegions\tHemisphere\tCluster size (voxels)\tPeak MNI coordinate\tPeak MNI coordinate\tPeak MNI coordinate\tPeak F values\ndFCD variance\tRegions\tHemisphere\tCluster size (voxels)\tX\tY\tZ\tPeak F values\nGlobal\tMTG\tL\t49\t\u221260\t\u221242\t\u22126\t12.65\n\tIFG\tL\t20\t\u221251\t18\t15\t17.3\n\tThalamus\tB\t19\t3\t\u221215\t6\t11.04\nContralateral\tMTG\tL\t62\t\u221257\t\u221242\t\u22123\t14.89\n\tThalamus\tR\t22\t15\t\u22126\t6\t12.51\n\tITG\tR\t50\t45\t\u221215\t\u221230\t12.46\nIpsilateral\tMTG\tL\t32\t\u221260\t\u221233\t\u22123\t11.56\n\tIFG\tL\t44\t\u221251\t18\t15\t25.39\n### Caption\nBetween\u2010group differences in the global, contralateral, and ipsilateral dFCD variances\n### Footer\nAbbreviations: B, bilateral; dFCD, dynamic functional connectivity density; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; ITG, inferior temporal gyrus; L, left; MTG, middle temporal gyrus; R, right.\n\n\n## ID: hbm25958-tbl-0003\n### Label: TABLE 3\nsFCD\tRegions\tHemisphere\tCluster size (voxels)\tPeak MNI coordinate\tPeak MNI coordinate\tPeak MNI coordinate\tPeak F values\nsFCD\tRegions\tHemisphere\tCluster size (voxels)\tX\tY\tZ\tPeak F values\nGlobal\tThalamus\tB\t112\t0\t\u221215\t9\t13.65\nContralateral\tThalamus\tB\t97\t0\t\u221215\t9\t13.82\nIpsilateral\tThalamus\tB\t118\t3\t\u221218\t9\t13.55\n\tIFG\tR\t32\t27\t24\t\u221221\t13.77\n### Caption\nBetween\u2010group differences in the global, contralateral, and ipsilateral sFCD\n### Footer\nAbbreviations: B, bilateral; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; R, right; sFCD, static functional connectivity density.\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9435010, "text_md5": "696437aa1cdfa90e39fee298cd83a33a", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 167], "journal": [168, 182], "publication_year": [184, 188], "title": [199, 365], "keywords": [379, 526], "abstract": [539, 3138], "body": [3147, 31881], "tables": [31894, 34162]}, "batch": 4, "pmid": 35611547, "doi": "10.1002/hbm.25958", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9435010", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9435010"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9435010\">9435010</a>", "list_title": "PMC9435010  Abnormal interhemispheric and intrahemispheric functional connectivity dynamics in drug\u2010na\u00efve first\u2010episode schizophrenia patients with auditory verbal hallucinations"}

Reacting to unpredictable events takes hundreds of milliseconds. Understanding where and how the brain represents what actions are likely to follow one another is, therefore, important. Everyday actions occur in predictable sequences, yet neuroscientists focus on how brains respond to unexpected, individual motor acts. Using fMRI, we show the brain encodes sequence-related information in the motor system. Using EEG, we show visual responses are faster and smaller for predictable sequences. We hope this paradigm encourages the field to shift its focus from single acts to motor sequences. It sheds light on how we adapt to the actions of others and suggests that the motor system may implement perceptual predictive coding. \n   Highlights  \n  \nIntersubject correlation can be used to investigate how the brain represents chains of actions. \n  \nWhen observing natural actions, sequence-specific information is encoded in regions associated with the motor system. \n  \nWhen observing acts in time-scrambled sequences, mentalizing regions are recruited. \n  \nEmbedding observed actions in predictable sequences leads to faster and smaller responses in visual cortices, in line with inhibitory feed-back models. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe capacity to perceive and predict actions performed by others is fundamental to proper social interactions. Over the past few decades, much research attention has been devoted to identifying the neural mechanisms that underlie the processing of simple acts such as grasping, reaching, breaking, and performing simple gestures. Electrophysiological work on non-human primates has identified that some of the neurons active while participants perform simple acts are also active when observing (or hearing) similar acts performed by others. These neurons, called \u2018mirror neurons\u2019, were originally identified in ventral premotor region F5 and in the rostral inferior parietal region PF/PFG ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Later studies have described neurons with such mirroring properties in (a) somatosensory cortices (particularly in SII and adjacent sectors of SI  ), (b) the dorsal premotor cortex ( ;  ), and (c) to a lesser extent, the primary motor cortex ( ;  ;  ). Our current estimate of the mirror neuron system \u2013 i.e. the network of brain regions with neurons rendered active during both the observation and performance of specific actions \u2013 comprises all these regions. Whether such mirror neurons exist elsewhere in the primate brain remains unanswered, as systematic experiments to examine the issue remain to be carried out. The firing of individual mirror neurons contains information that will permit accurate classification of the acts performed by others (C  ). This work has led to the idea that isolated observed or heard acts are processed, at least in part, by recruiting somatosensory-motor representations of the monkey's own actions ( ;  ;  ). A large number of neuroimaging studies in humans have identified an   action observation network   triggered by the observation of such simple acts (for ALE meta-analyses of these studies see for instance  ;  ;  ). A smaller number of studies have tested the same participants during both their observation and execution of manual actions. These studies identified a network of voxels involved in both conditions (e.g.  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). We shall henceforth refer to this network as the Action Observation-Execution Network (AOEN). The AOEN network includes (a) the presumed human homologue of the brain areas in which mirror neurons have been found in monkeys (vPM, dPM, SI, SII, PF/PFG) and (b) a number of regions that have not yet been systematically explored for the presence of mirror neurons in monkeys (in particular, the cerebellum, SPL, SMA and regions of the visual cortex such as V5 and EBA). Pattern classification analyses have confirmed that the pattern of brain activity in premotor, inferior parietal and somatosensory cortices does contain information that could help the organism perceive which motor act someone else performed ( ;  ). Disturbing activity in the somatosensory-motor nodes of this AOEN (SI, IPL, PM) leads to deficits in the processing of observed actions (for recent reviews see  ;  ;  ). Together, these findings suggest that humans also recruit brain regions associated with the planning, execution and somatosensation of their own actions in their perception and interpretation of the actions of others. \n\nIn contrast, we know very little about   where   and   how   the brain represents knowledge and expectations about   sequences   of acts, e.g. preparing breakfast ( ;  ;  ). Intelligent participation in coherent action sequences inevitably requires information that goes beyond the sum of the knowledge about the individual acts that go into their making. Representing a sequence of acts entails representing the order in which the acts were performed. Such   ordinal   information is critical to predicting actions that people are likely to perform as the follow up to a previous step. This prediction, in turn, is crucial to an intelligent agent's proactive planning of reactions to the that follow up. In this paper, we shall present the experimental evidence we have gathered about both the areas and the manner in which this knowledge is represented in the brain. \n\nTo explore   where   the brain encodes sequence level information, we localized regions responding differently to acts in a logical sequence (e.g. grasping a bun, cutting the bun, buttering the bun) and in a random sequence. Some scientists (e.g.  ;  ;  ) have argued that such higher-level information is more likely to be represented in the Theory of Mind (ToM) network than in the motor system. Systematic reviews of studies looking at reasoning about the mental states of others have revealed a core network composed of the medial prefrontal and rTPJ that are consistently activated whenever participants are reasoning about mental states of others irrespective of the task- and stimulus format ( ;  ). There are some, including us, who suggest that the AOEN could represent sequence-level information. We base our suggestion on insights from experiments on monkeys showing that mirror neurons in the motor system are sensitive to expectations about upcoming actions ( ;  ). This is also in line with observations that premotor cortices do represent sequences of stimuli in other domains ( ;  ;  ). When we act, we can see our own actions unfold in our perceptual space, so we can surmise that Hebbian learning in the synapses mutually connecting our visual and motor systems would encode the transitional probabilities across individual motor acts, and thereby enable our AOEN to represent sequence-level information and anticipation in a predictive coding framework ( ). Indeed the possibility that the AOEN is involved in such prediction is corroborated by recent experiments that show that virtual lesions to premotor cortices ( ;  ) or neurological lesions to the premotor, somatosensory or inferior parietal cortices ( ) interferes with our ability to precit actions in a sequence. \n\n suggests a powerful experimental method to investigate this issue. They took a story and presented it to participants once in its intact form, or then after cutting it at the spaces between words and randomizing the order of the words. If brain regions are sensitive only to word-level information, randomizing the order of the words in the story should not alter brain activity. The hypothesis was that, if brain regions respond to higher, sentence- or paragraph-level information, then, randomizing the order of the words should destroy that information and reduce the efficacy of brain activity. Brain activity was then analysed using inter-subject correlations (ISC) ( ). ISC maps information about a stimulus in the brain in a model free fashion based on a simple logic. If a voxel has no information about a stimulus, its activity reflects spontaneous activity and will not be correlated in time with that of other participants exposed to the same stimulus. If a voxel's activity is strictly determined by a stimulus, activity across witnesses of the stimulus will be similar, and the inter-subject correlation will be significant. If so, the higher the temporal correlation between subjects with respect to a voxel, the more evidence we have of that voxel's ability to contain information about the stimulus. By comparing ISC of the intact and scrambled sentences, Lerner et\u00a0al. identified brain regions that show evidence of significant additional information/correlation when sentence level information was preserved, i.e., when the sentences were presented intact, than when sentence level information was degraded, i.e., when the words were presented in a random order. \n\nHere we adapted this approach to localize brain regions containing action sequence-level information. We recorded movies of routine actions lasting approximately 1\u202fmin ( ). We then measured brain activity using fMRI in 22 participants while they viewed intact movies that contain sequence- and act-level information. Then we presented the same movies disjointed at the points of transition between acts, and with the order of the acts randomized. We also measured brain activity while participants viewed these scrambled movies containing the same act-level information, but with perturbed sequence-level information ( ). We then localized brain regions that had significantly different ISC values for the intact and scrambled movies to identify regions involved in processing sequence-level information. It is important to note that not finding a region in this contrast does not means that region has no role in encoding sequence-level information. In addition to the usual limitations regarding negative findings, this is because ISC identifies activations occurring at the same location and time across participants, and thus focuses on stimulus-locked processes ( ;  ). If different participants encode the sequence of the overall actions (e.g. making breakfast) at different points along the sequence, this would evade the ISC analysis, and a region could then be involved in encoding this form of sequence-level information without showing increased ISC. We will therefore supplement ISC analyses with analyses exploring average activity levels across the sequences to shed light on activity that is consistent in location across individuals but not in timing. We generated a simple excel sheet to illustrate the difference between ISC and a traditional block-design GLM (bGLM, see Supplementary Materials \u2013 ISC bGLM differences). The ISC detects stimulus-locked fluctuations of activity that occur at the same time for all participants \u2013 even if this activity does not lead to a net increase of activity. GLM, in contrast, detects net increases in activity independently of whether the timing of the increase is consistent across participants. Importantly, if a given region shows significantly more ISC for the intact version than for the scrambled version, we are justified in taking it as evidence that this region represents information about what has been perturbed by the scrambling: the natural order of actions in the observed sequence.   \nList of sequences used as stimuli with total duration in seconds and number of motor acts. \n  Table\u00a01     \n Stimulus used in the study.   A movie of a familiar action (e.g. preparing a bun for breakfast with butter and jam) is shown in an intact (left) and scrambled (right) version. Both versions contain the exact same individual acts (slicing the bun, spreading the jam, etc.), but in a different order. Note the 45\u00b0camera angle change between every two consecutive acts in both intact and scrambled sequences. This was done to ensure that the inevitable visual transients created by rearranging a sequence in the scrambled condition are also present in the intact condition, and to remove low level confounds. \n  Fig.\u00a01   \n\nOur next aim is to shed light on   how   the brain encodes sequence-level information. Anatomically, we know that the higher regions of the visual system in the temporal lobe are reciprocally connected with regions of the posterior inferior parietal lobe which in turn are connected to dorsal and ventral premotor and somatosensory brain regions ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) (for reviews see  ;  ). We can distinguish three families of models of the functional architecture of action observation based on how these models conceive of the feed-back connections back from parietal regions to the visual cortices ( ). The first family highlights the role of feed-  forward   connections in triggering motor programs that match visual input ( ) without ascribing any specific function to the feed-back connections. The second family aims at explaining imitation and acknowledges the role of feed-  back   connections to visual regions, and assumes that these feedback connections provide excitatory efference copies that   activate   matching visual representations in a way akin to mental imagery ( ). On the basis of considerations derived from Hebbian learning and the observation that single neurons in the monkey STS are inhibited during action execution, the third family proposes that neurons in the visual cortex are   inhibited   by parietal predictions via inhibitory feed-back connections ( ;  ) in a way akin to predictive coding models derived from a Bayesian brain perspective ( ). As inhibitory feedback cancels predictions from the visual response, the feed-forward visual information in this model becomes a representation of prediction errors rather than of what is seen in the outside world. At this point, we shall leverage the fact that these theories predict different neural activity patterns in the visual cortex as part of our strategy to shed light on the computational mechanisms involved in action observation. Purely feed-forward accounts conceive of the visual cortex only as an input stage to action perception and therefore would not be able to predict early visual areas to respond differentially to acts in their proper order and to those out of their order. Excitatory efference-copy models would suggest that the response to predicted individual acts is amplified in early visual regions by excitatory efference copies, so that early neuronal visual responses to intact sequences should be larger than response to actions in scambled order. In contrast, inhibitory predictive coding models propose that early visual cortex essentially encodes prediction errors, and that neural activity in early visual responses should be the strongest in the case of individual acts embedded in scrambled sequences. As for the parietal node of the system, it is difficult to obtain clear predictions from the first two families of models. However, the third type of model (predictive coding) predicts that the response to acts in intact sequence should be hundreds of milliseconds faster than that to acts in scrambled sequences. This is because sensorimotor delays during re-afference are thought to wire the system so that a given action arouses expectations of the following action by priming its sensorimotor representations in the parietal cortex ( ;  ). Because of its low temporal resolution fMRI is ill suited to resolve the individual motor acts embedded in our sequences or the sub-second shifts in response timing predicted by our models. Accordingly, we opted for high-density EEG to compare the evoked visual response to individual motor acts in the intact version with the responses to the scrambled version. Certain situations may complicate the predictions made by these models. For instance excitatory efference copies may down-regulate redundant sensory input, and thus minimize the expected increase of activity in early visual cortices. At the same time, inhibitory efference copies may for instance reduce neural activity for expected stimuli in pyramidal neurons (as measured with EEG) but fail to decrease the BOLD signal locally because of the metabolic costs of inhibition (but see  ).   \n Predictions of different action-observation models.   Feed-forward models (top) emphasize feed-forward connections from visual to parietal regions and do not ascribe a function to feed-back connections. They do not make particular predictions on the timing of parietal activations for intact and scrambled sequences (middle column) but predict that visual cortices (right-most column) respond similarly to a particular observed act embedded in the intact and the scrambled sequence. Efference-copy models (middle row) originating from imitation models suggest that feed-back connections are important and excitatory, and hence that in intact sequences, correct predictions in the parietal lobe should heighten visual responses compared to those in scrambled sequences. However, it is unclear what predictions they make regarding the timing of responses in the parietal lobe. Finally, predictive coding theories suggest that in intact sequences, the parietal lobe should show predictive responses (that thus have latencies shorter than in scrambled sequences) and inhibit responses in the visual cortex (bottom row). \n  Fig.\u00a02   \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nAll participants were right handed as per the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory ( ), had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of neurological or psychiatric disorder. Informed consent was provided by each participant according to the procedure approved by the ethics review board of the University of Amsterdam (2013-EXT-2847). For the fMRI experiments, 22 healthy Caucasian participants took part (11 male, 11 female, mean age 23.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.46sd). None of the participants were excluded from the fMRI dataset. For the EEG experiment, a total of 24 participants were tested. Of these, 10 had also taken part in the fMRI experiment (5 male). The other 12 fMRI participants could unfortunately not be traced back when we decided to perform the follow up EEG experiment, and an additional 14 participants (7 male, 7 female, mean 25.07\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.53sd) were recruited for the EEG experiment alone. Three of these additional EEG participants were excluded from the analyses. For two of these subjects, we found that all the channels were equally corrupted by motion artefacts and this was present in a large number of trials. This became evident by using FieldTrip's FT_REJECTVISUAL and FT_DATABROWSER functions which are made available for helping with manual rejections of artefacts. The third was rejected because the impedances of the electrodes were unusually high, and the data noisy. This resulted in a final sample of 21 EEG participants (12 females, age: 26.76\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.86sd). \n\n\n### Stimuli & experimental procedure \n  \nTwenty movies containing different daily actions (e.g. preparing sandwiches with butter and jam; see   for the full list) were recorded simultaneously by two video cameras (Sony MC50, 29 frames/s) at an angle of 45\u00b0. The videos were edited using ADOBE Premier Pro CS5 running on Windows. Each movie was subdivided into shots containing one meaningful motor act each (e.g. taking bread, opening the butter dish, scooping butter with knife, etc.). This was done on recordings from both camera angles. These motor acts (mean duration 2s\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviation 1s) were then assembled to build two types of stimuli ( ). For the   intact   (I) presentation, the natural temporal sequence in which the acts were recorded was maintained, but a camera angle change was introduced between every two consecutive acts by alternate sampling from the recordings of the two cameras. In the   scrambled   (S) versions, the acts remained the same, but the order of the acts was randomly rearranged, and a camera angle change was introduced between every two consecutive acts. Camera angle changes were imposed at each act transition in both types of movies to compensate for the visual transients that would otherwise be present only in the scrambled movies. \n\nDuring both the fMRI and EEG experiments, participants had to watch all the 20 movies, which were presented using the Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Albany, CA, USA) in four different sessions each containing 5 intact and 5 scrambled examples, shown in a pseudo-randomized fashion, with an inter-movie interval between 8 and 12\u202fs. No behavioural response was required during the four sessions, but participants were to carefully observe the videos. To facilitate the integration of the results in the two experiments, we adjusted the EEG setup so as to create a situation that resembles that in the fMRI setup. Specifically, the illumination of the room was dimmed down to resemble the luminance of the scanner room and the screen was placed at a distance of 120 centimetres from the participant to achieve a similar angular stimulus size. \n\nIn order to minimize the repetition effect of seeing the same movies twice, for the ten participants that took part in both the fMRI and EEG experiment, a temporal interval of 6 months was imposed between the two experiments. Besides, to ensure that participants paid attention to the movies in both the fMRI and EEG experiments, they were told that they would be required to answer three questions (that the experimenter would pick out of 22 prepared questions) to test their comprehension of the stimuli (e.g.,   Did you see roses or tulips during the movie clip? What flavour was the jam? How many batteries were used in the torch?)  . Comparing the number of correct responses between the fMRI and EEG experiment suggests that participants were similarly attentive: a traditional independent sample   t  -test revealed no evidence against the null hypothesis (t \u202f=\u202f-0.024, p\u202f=\u202f0.98) and a Bayesian independent sample   t  -test as implemented in JASP ( ) with default settings revealed evidence for the null hypothesis of equal performance (BF \u202f=\u202f0.29, all BF \u202f<\u202f1/3 are considered evidence for the null). \n\n\n### fMRI acquisition \n  \nData were acquired on a 3T Philips Achieva scanner with a 32-channel head coil. Functional images were acquired with simultaneous multi-slice excitation equal to 3, (TR\u202f=\u202f721\u202fms, TE\u202f=\u202f28\u202fms), 39 axial slices of 3\u202fmm with no gap and FOV of 240\u202f\u00d7\u202f240\u202f\u00d7\u202f39\u202fmm. Images were reconstructed offline by Recon (Gyro Tools, Switzerland,  ), after which the FOV was 120\u202f\u00d7\u202f78\u202f\u00d7\u202f240\u202fmm. For each participant a T1 weighted image of 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1x1 mm voxels was acquired. Stimuli were projected on an LCD screen and viewed through a mirror attached to the head coil. \n\nThe entire fMRI data can be found at  . \n\n\n### fMRI inter-subject correlation analyses \n  \nData were pre-processed using SPM12 ( ) and custom-built MATLAB 9.8 (Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA) routines. The raw voxel time courses were bandpass filtered between 0.01 and 0.2\u202fHz, as this is known to be the optimal band to perform ISC ( ). At this stage the BOLD time courses corresponding to all the intact and scrambled movies presented to the subject were extracted, de-meaned (voxel- and movie-wise), and concatenated in such a way that the concatenated order would remain invariant across participants irrespective of the pseudo-random order in which they saw the movies. Before concatenating to a single 4D NIFTI file, we trimmed three TRs from the beginning and the end of each movie epoch to remove the influence of non-specific BOLD transients ( ). Each subject's 4D file was then realigned to the mean image of the time course. The T1 weighted anatomical image was then co-registered to the mean functional image and segmented. All EPI images were normalized at 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2x2mm resolution to the template MNI brain using the forward deformation tensor derived from the segmentation of the T1 image of that subject. The normalized images were then smoothed with an 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f8x8 mm (FWHM) Gaussian filter. \n\nInter-subject correlations were calculated using the ISC toolbox ( ) and in-house MATLAB routines and SPM12. \n\nAfter the pre-processing step for ISC, we had two 3D time courses per subject, one for intact and the other for scrambled movies. For the subject-level ISC analysis, the time course of a given voxel in subject   i   was correlated with the average time course of all other subjects of that corresponding voxel. This was repeated for every voxel and with all subjects, resulting in a whole-brain map of correlation values per subject ( ;  ). \n\nThese correlation maps were then used in a second-level random effects analysis in SPM: a one-sample   t  -test for I\u202f>\u202f0 (H0: I\u202f\u2264\u202f0, i.e. in each voxel, the distribution of the ISC value across the 22 participants was compared against the null hypothesis of an ISC \u22640) and S\u202f>\u202f0 (idem for H0:ISC \u22640) and a paired sample   t  -test comparing I and S (H0:ISC \u202f=\u202fISC ) was performed at every voxel. To determine what findings are significant, we first thresholded all contrasts at p\u202f<\u202f0.001 uncorrected with a minimum cluster size of k\u202f=\u202f20 voxels. This combination ensured that all results in the I vs S contrast survive a cluster-size family-wise error correction at p <0.05 (see the p-values in the results table), and most in the I\u202f>\u202f0 or S\u202f>\u202f0 contrasts. Cluster size-correction, however, does not ensure that one can interpret the location of individual voxels within the cluster. To ensure that no more than 5% of individual voxels are false positives, we determined the critical t-value that ensures a voxel-wise false discovery rate of q\u202f<\u202f0.05. Using a voxel-wise false discovery correction for multiple comparison with q\u202f<\u202f0.05 and cluster-size threshold set at k\u202f>\u202f20 voxels, t-values greater than 2.56 and 2.58 for I\u202f>\u202f0 and S\u202f>\u202f0 respectively and 3.92 for I vs. S are significant. Often, this t  is less stringent then the critical t for p <0.001 (t \u202f=\u202f3.52), and we then simply used the t  threshold. If the q\u202f<\u202f0.05 was more stringent (as in the I vs S contrast), we then used the more stringent q\u202f<\u202f0.05\u202ft value (t \u202f=\u202f3.92). In short, our threshold was always t\u202f=\u202fmax (t , t ). \n\nThe ISC revealed that intact movies generated more synchronized activity across participants than that in the case of scrambled movies in 8 clusters (  ISC I\u2014S). To determine whether these regions clustered in a smaller number of networks, we transformed these 8 clusters into regions of interest for signal extraction. Because the right parietal cluster was very large and spanned several cyto-architectonic regions at q\u202f<\u202f0.05, we split this cluster into several sub-clusters by marginally increasing the threshold from t\u202f>\u202f3.92 to t\u202f>\u202f4.1, which split this large cluster into three clusters (ROIs 7,9 and 10 in Figure, 4). All other ROIs were defined at t\u202f>\u202f3.92 corresponding to q  < 0.05,  a and  . We used Marsbar ( ) to extract the time-course of each voxel within each ROI. We then calculated the Eigen-time-course in each of them. The Eigen time-course from each of these ROIs was then averaged over all participants to focus on stimulus driven activity ( ) and to form a cross-correlation matrix between all the ROIs (see  ). Two clusters of activation were excluded from this ROI analysis: (1) the cerebellum, because the cluster was small (23 voxels) and located at the margin between the cerebellum and ventral visual cortex, making the interpretation as cerebellar or cortical difficult; (2) area TE3, because it was at the outermost rim of the cortex with most voxels outside of the gray-matter mask. We used the first Eigen-time-course of each of the other ROIs, despite the ROIs being relatively large, because it suffices to capture the vast majority of the variance in the signal (average\u202f=\u202f88%, range\u202f=\u202f[78%\u201398%]). This correlation matrix was used as input to a   canonical multi-dimensional scaling algorithm   that positioned the ROIs on a 2D map according to the pattern of correlations between a particular ROI and others, with ROIs having similar patterns mapped closer to each other. A k-means clustering algorithm was then used to determine the number and membership of clusters in this data. To determine the number of clusters, given the relatively low number of data-points, we used the Silhouette procedure reported by  . The procedure involves computing the k-means with k being set to 2,3,4 and 5 clusters (more clusters seemed inappropriate for 10 data-points). For each value of k we calculated the Silhouette value for each data point (a large value implies that the point is well within a cluster while low values reflect ambiguity). We repeated this procedure using the   concatenated   Eigen-time-course of all participants rather than the   averaged   Eigen-time-course. This led to the same classification in three networks for all except one ROI, viz., ROI 4, in the dorsal premotor cortex, and then switches from the blue to the red network.   \n Regions with significant ISC (top panel) and bGLM (middle panel), and their overlap with the localizers.   Each row of the top and middle panels corresponds to the contrast indicated on the left and shows lateral and posterior renders and four axial slices of the average normalized gray-matter segment of the 22 participants. Cold/warm colours represent significant negative/positive t-values. Results are shown at p\u2013values < 0.001 and cluster-size threshold of k\u202f=\u202f20 (to impose the same t\u202f>\u202f3.52 threshold on all contrasts), but voxels not surviving a voxel wise false discovery rate (FDR) correction at q\u202f=\u202f0.05 were excluded (inclusive masking with in SPM). The bottom panel shows the results of the overlap between the ISC and bGLM analyses, and our AOEN and ToM networks. (a) Overlap across regions showing more synchrony (ISC, red) or average activation (bGLM, blue) for intact movies and the AOEN (green). No overlap was found with the ToM network, which is why this network is not shown here. (b) Overlap (yellow) between regions showing more average activation (bGLM, red) during the scrambled movies and the ToM network (green), particularly in the TPJ. No overlap was found with the AOEN, which is why this network is not shown here. See  , and  ,  ,  ,   for the corresponding MNI coordinate tables. The t-maps for ISC and gGLM can also be found in. nii format in the supplementary materials together with the average anatomy of our participants. \n  Fig.\u00a03     \n ISC Networks.   The Eigen-time courses in the 10 regions showing ISC I-S (a) were compared using a   canonical multi-dimensional scaling algorithm   (b), in which regions with similar time courses are close to each other (see also  ). A k-means clustering revealed that these regions can be summarized as 3 networks (colours in b). These networks (colored in red, green and blue separately in panels d\u2013e) have significant correlations between them (c). (g\u2013i) shows the average activity of these networks for each movie averaged over all participants (every row of the matrix corresponds to a movie) and the average across all movies (time course beneath each matrix). The white spaces in the matrix and the region bounded by red-dashed lines on the time course are where the ISC does not exceed that of randomized samples and is thus not significant. The ROI labels that have a star marked on top had significant co-activation with the motor-execution task (Supplementary Methods S2). \n  Fig.\u00a04     \n ISC (I  \u2014  S).  \n\nRegions with ISC Intact\u202f>\u202fScrambled labelled using SPM Anatomy Toolbox. Results are shown, as for  , using the most stringent threshold between the FDR correction at q\u202f<\u202f0.05 and the uncorrected at p\u202f<\u202f0.001: max (t \u202f=\u202f3.93, t \u202f=\u202f3.53) and k\u202f=\u202f20. The first column of the table also indicates whether a particular cluster survives family wise error correction at cluster level. \n\nFrom left to right: the cluster size in number of voxels and FWE; the number of voxels falling in a cyto-architectonic area; the percentage of the cluster that falls in the cyto-architectonic area; the activated hemisphere (L\u202f=\u202fleft; R\u202f=\u202fright); the name of the cyto-architectonic area when available or the anatomical description; the percentage of the area that is activated by the cluster; the t values of the peaks associated with the cluster followed by their MNI coordinates in mm; the number of the ROIs in   to which the cluster corresponds (the first cluster was split in 3 by increasing the threshold to t\u202f>\u202f4.1). \n  Table\u00a02   \n\nThis is likely to be due to the strong intrinsic connectivity between the dorsal premotor cortex and the ROIs of the red network at rest ( ), which contaminates the cross-correlation matrix if averaging across participants is not performed ( ). \n\n\n### fMRI general linear model analyses (GLM) \n  \nThe pre-processing pipeline for the GLM analyses began with temporal filtering as in the case of the ISC. Subsequently the four different sessions were slice time corrected and realigned. The T1 image was co-registered to the mean EPI, and segmented. The EPI images were then normalized using the forward deformation tensors derived from that segmentation, written at a 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2x2mm resolution, and then smoothed with an 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f8x8 mm (FWHM) Gaussian filter. \n\nIn the first level analysis of the GLM, the five blocks of the intact and five of the scrambled movies were modelled as two regressors-of-interest in each of the sessions. Movement parameters estimated during realignment were included as covariates of no interest in the analysis. The regression coefficients were then used in second-level analysis in SPM: a one sample   t  -test for I\u202f>\u202f0 (H0: I\u202f\u2264\u202f0) and S\u202f>\u202f0 (H0:S\u202f\u2264\u202f0) and a paired sample   t  -test comparing I and S (H0:I S) was performed at every voxel. Thresholding was performed as for the ISC results: first we imposed a p <0.001 k\u202f=\u202f20 threshold (t\u202f=\u202f3.52), which again ensured that most results survive a family-wise error correction for cluster size (see p-values in result tables). To interpret individual voxels, we also imposed a q\u202f<\u202f0.05 voxel-wise false discovery correction for multiple comparison. This lead to a more permissive t-values of 2.81 and 2.77 respectively for I\u202f>\u202f0 and S\u202f>\u202f0, and we thus maintained the p\u202f<\u202f0.001 threshold of t\u202f=\u202f3.52 in those cases, and t\u202f=\u202f3.87 for I vs. S, and we thus used this more stringent t-value as a threshold for that contrast. \n\n\n### EEG data acquisition \n  \nEEG data were acquired with the actiCHamp (Brain products Gmbh Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) amplifier system with active electrodes. We recorded from a 128-electrode active array embedded in an elastic cap (ActiCap International, Inc.) in accordance with the 10\u201320 International System. In addition to the scalp electrodes, an active electrode was placed on the forehead (AFz, 25\u202fmm above the nasion), and two electrodes on the left and right infraorbital rim to detect and clean eye movement artefacts. Impedance of all electrodes was kept below 5\u202fk\u03a9. The EEG signal was digitized at a sampling rate of 500\u202fHz (16 bit AD converter), and a hardware high-pass filter was applied at 0.15\u202fHz to remove slow drifts. \n\nTriggers were recorded at every camera change (corresponding to the transition between acts) during the movie. This was done by adding a white square on the last and first frames of each act on the side of the movie. An LED was then placed over the location of the square, and a wooden black masking frame ensured that the square was invisible to the participant. The output from the LED was then introduced as a digital channel input in the EEG recording system. \n\n\n### EEG data analysis \n  \nEEG data were analysed and pre-processed using in-house MATLAB ( ) routines and the FieldTrip analysis software in MATLAB ( ). Eye-movement and ECG artefacts were removed using the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) procedure; a spatio-temporal ICA provides several topographical plots of ICA components, which are then manually selected for ECG and eye-movement artefacts following the criteria recommended in the FieldTrip manual ( ). These components were removed and the remaining components back-projected to the original space to obtain the \u201ccleaned\u201d EEG signal. Across the runs, we rejected 5 components for 11 subjects, 6 components for 5 subjects, 7 components for 3 subjects, and 8 components for 3 subjects. \n\nSince, the task did not involve the generation of deliberate motor responses, we found almost no muscle artefacts in our data. Notch filters of 1\u202fHz centred on 50\u202fHz and its harmonics were used to remove the generic electrical cycle frequencies. \n\nThe Event-related potentials (ERPs) were calculated around each camera change marking the beginning of a new act. Each trial was defined over a window 500\u202fms before and 1000\u202fms after the camera change. We therefore had 1292 trials in total including both the scrambled and the intact movies. All trials were then averaged within condition. Because the movies are continuous, the 500\u202fms prior to a camera change is not a traditional baseline, but is the end of the previous act. Regarding the period after the camera change, 98% of the acts had durations longer than 650\u202fms. Accordingly, we focus our analyses on the first 650\u202fms of this epoch, which is largely unperturbed by camera changes of subsequent acts. \n\nTo determine the time points on every channel for which the ERPs from the two conditions differed significantly, we used a standard cluster-based max-sum permutation test following   as implemented in FieldTrip while addressing multiple comparison issues (750 time points x 128 channels). For every channel and time-point the experimental conditions were compared by means of a   t  -test (with n\u00a0=\u00a0number of participants). All samples (channel-time pair) whose t-values are below a t-threshold corresponding to the uncorrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 cluster-forming threshold are set to a value of zero. For all pairs exceeding this threshold, the value is first set to be the sum of its own t-value and those of the neighbouring channels, integrated over a time period extending from \u221225\u00a0ms to +25\u00a0ms. Then in a second step, the value is set to the maximum of the sum values across these same spatio-temporal neighbours. \n\nOnce the max-sum statistic is calculated, we need to determine its likelihood under the null hypothesis using a Monte Carlo method. Trials of the different experimental conditions (intact and scrambled) are conducted in a single set. As many trials from this combined data set as there were subjects in condition 1 are randomly drawn and placed into \u201cpseudo-subset 1\u201d. The remaining trials are placed in pseudo-subset 2. The test statistic (max-sum) is calculated for this random partition. The procedure for random partition and test statistics is repeated 5000 times and a histogram of the test statistic is constructed. We calculate the proportion of random partitions that result in a larger test statistic than the observed one. This proportion is the Monte Carlo significance probability, which is also our p-value. \n\nIf this p-value for a particular time-channel pair is smaller than 0.05 we conclude that the data in the two experimental conditions are significantly different at that channel and time. \n\nFor testing the significance of time-invariant parameters, the same cluster approach was used, except that the max-sum was sum applied only across neighbouring electrodes. \n\n\n### EEG source reconstruction \n  \nTo capture the distributed representation of the underlying neuronal activity that resulted in the sensor-level measurements of brain activity, we performed source reconstruction using the minimum-norm estimation (MNE) method ( ). MNE is an approach favoured for evoked responses and for tracking widespread activity over time. It involves solving a distributed inverse solution that discretizes the source space into locations in the brain volume using a number of current dipoles. It then estimates the amplitude of all modelled sources simultaneously to recover a source distribution whilst minimizing the overall source energy. \n\nAs part of the source reconstruction, we used an MNI template to create two geometric objects, viz., the volume conduction model and the source model. The volume conduction model determines the physics of the propagation of electrical activity through the head, which in turn depends on the conductivity of the various tissues between the source and the sensor. The source space, which will be populated with current dipoles, is the cortical sheet extracted from the anatomical image using a combination of FreeSurfer ( ) and MNE Suite ( ). The volume conduction and source models are then used to determine the lead fields (from source to sensor space) using OPENMEEG ( ). The FieldTrip EEG analysis package was used to wrap the above packages along with helper functions to construct the pipeline for source reconstruction. Noise-covariance is calculated using a time-locked analysis over the sensor space. The lead fields along with the noise-covariance was used to reconstruct the source-level activity at every time-step. \n\nThe ERPs of the two conditions (intact and scrambled) were contrasted to determine the time instances during which they differed significantly. Source reconstruction was performed at these time-points to reveal the source of the brain activity on the cortex. \n\n\n### EEG mu-suppression \n  \nTo assess whether mu suppression was stronger over central electrodes, we performed a time-frequency decomposition of the EEG data from C3, C4, and Cz around each camera change. This was done for the interval \u22120.45\u20130.85s relative to each camera change from frequencies ranging from 2\u202fHz to 40\u202fHz in steps of 2\u202fHz using FieldTrip's function FT_FREQANALYSIS, specifically calculating the time-frequency decomposition using the MTMCOLV method, which is a multi-taper time-frequency transformation based on multiplication in the frequency domain using discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (Slepian sequences) as tapers. The power at each moment and frequency was then averaged over all camera changes of the intact movies, and separately for all camera changes of the scrambled movies, to generate a single time-frequency decomposition pattern per participant and condition. Dividing the power of the intact by the scrambled decomposition yields a power ratio that should be below 1 if intact movies lead to more mu-suppression (hence less power) than scrambled movies. We then tested this ratio using a one-tailed   t  -test (df\u202f=\u202f22-1) separately for each time point and frequency. To correct for multiple comparisons, we used the fdr_bh routine in MATLAB, with q\u202f=\u202f0.05. To test for effects that do not vary over time, we also averaged the power over the time window, generating a single power-spectrum per participant and condition, and compared the I/S ratio against 1 (using a one-tailed   t  -test, df\u202f=\u202f22-1) for each frequency, using an FDR correction at q\u202f<\u202f0.05. \n\n\n### EEG coherence analyses \n  \nTo assess whether visual and parietal regions alter their connectivity in intact vs scrambled conditions, we calculated the coherence of the EEG signal between early visual cortices and the supramarginal parietal region, which the ISC analysis had revealed. We used FieldTrip to calculate the coherence between six ROIs. These ROIs are, 'V1V2V3_Left', 'V1V2V3_Right', 'V5_Left', 'V5_Right', 'LSupraMG' and 'RSupraMG'. To define the V1V2V3 ROIs, we extracted a binary image of these joined anatomical regions in MNI space using the anatomy toolbox. For V5 we used the same approach. For the supramarginal ROI (\u2018SupraMG\u2019), we used ROI 5 and 9 in  E. These volume masks were mapped to the source space (nodes in the tessellation of the brain). Time courses at these source locations were reconstructed using a beamformer following the LCMV method used in FieldTrip. Sources belonging to the same mask were then averaged to obtain a mean time course per ROI and participant in the source space. These time courses were then analysed to obtain coherence spectra between the signals of pairs of ROIs. Five 200\u00a0ms time-windows were analysed in the range from \u2212200 to +800\u00a0ms relative to the camera change, and coherence was calculated in 2\u00a0Hz steps from 2 to 60\u00a0Hz with a resolution of 2\u00a0Hz. Using the multi-taper FFT method implemented in FieldTrip, we obtained one spectrum per subject, per time-window, for every pair of the 3 ROIs in the left, and for every pair of the 3 ROIs in the right hemisphere. A   t  -test was then used to compare the coherence in the intact and the scrambled conditions across the 22 participants at each frequency and time window, An FDR correction was then used to correct for multiple comparisons across 5 time-windows and 30 frequencies at q\u202f<\u202f0.01. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Intact movies show higher ISC \n  \nThe ISC analyses revealed that both intact and scrambled movies (  rows one and two, respectively) induce widespread synchronization across viewers. As might be expected, in both cases the visual cortices show high ISC reflecting the stimulus-locked nature of their responses. We also see significant ISC in parietal and premotor regions. The third row depicts the contrast in neural responses to intact and scrambled (I\u2014S) stimuli. There were no significant voxels for which the scrambled movie shows a higher ISC than the intact movies. On the other hand, a number of areas show higher ISC for intact movies. This included large clusters in the parietal lobe that extended into the L/R postcentral gyrus (including BA2, BA1 and BA3a,b), L/R superior (area 5L and 7A in particular) and inferior parietal lobule (PF/PFt in particular and a left-lateralized cluster extending along the intraparietal sulcus and PGa) and SII/PV. Other clusters were found in the dorsal mid-insula, dorsal pre-central gyrus (including BA6), the middle frontal gyrus, temporal visual area TE, occipital visual areas (including V2/V3) and cerebellar vermis and lobules V ( ). All of these clusters are larger than expected by chance (i.e. cluster-wise p <0.05). \n\n\n### Overlap between ISC (I\u2014S), AOEN and the ToM network \n  \nTo investigate the degree to which I\u2014S overlaps with regions involved in the observation and execution of individual motor acts (the so called AOEN), we used a functional localizer scan with a separate group of participants (see Supplementary Methods S1). Briefly, it includes all voxels that are activated both (a) when participants viewed goal-directed acts more than meaningless hand movements and (b) when participants executed motor acts. \n\nThe overlapping regions include large parietal clusters in both hemispheres that include somatosensory areas (BA2 and BA1 and SII in particular), inferior parietal regions (PFt/PFop in particular) and the superior parietal lobe (more specifically areas 7A and 5L). Overlapping regions also included right ventral premotor cortices (BA44), a region in the left dorsal mid insula ( ;   bottom panel). We also calculated the percentage of overlap between AOEN and ISC (I\u2014S) to find that 19% of all AOEN voxels show more ISC during I than S, and 38% of the ISC (I\u2014S) contrast fell within the AOEN.   \n ISC (I  \u2014  S) & AOEN.   Overlap between ISC (I\u202f>\u202fS) and the AOEN localizer. The ISC (I\u2014S) contrast was inclusively masked in spm with the AOEN network described in the Supplementary Methods S1, and thresholded as in   and   with the max (t \u202f=\u202f3.93, t \u202f=\u202f3.53). Conventions as in  . \n  Table\u00a03   \n\nTo investigate the degree of overlap with the ToM network, we used the activation-likelihood estimate meta-analysis proposed by   that identified regions recruited by ToM based on non-story tasks. No ISC (I\u2014S) voxels were found to overlap with these ToM areas. \n\n\n### GLM reveals areas differentially more active during the scrambled movies \n  \nBecause ISC focuses on stimulus-  locked   activity, to identify regions with differential stimulus-  induced   activity (i.e., activity triggered by the stimuli but at different times in different participants), we analysed the data using an approach in which each movie was modelled as a block in a GLM (bGLM) to capture the overall average activity during the viewing of a movie. Results of the bGLM are shown in   (middle panel) for I\u202f>\u202f0, S\u202f>\u202f0 and I\u2014S. Note that for I\u2014S ( ), we have both positive t values (i.e. I\u202f>\u202fS) and negative t-values (i.e. S\u202f>\u202fI). Regions with higher average activity for I than for S (positive t-values in warm colours) included bilateral dorsal precentral clusters in BA6, a right parietal cluster encompassing BA2, BA7 and BA5L and a left parietal cluster including BA7 and 5L, which were larger than expected by chance (p <0.05). We then found a smaller cluster in the left hemisphere including BA2 and 5L that did not survive cluster extent thresholding. Of these voxels, 85% fell within the regions identified by the ISC(I\u2014S) results. Regions with higher activity for Scrambled movies (negative t-values, cold colours in   middle panel;  ) consisted of (a) large clusters that survive a cluster-size p <0.05 of at least 164 voxels in the visual cortex (V1, V3, V4, Fusiform Gyrus), (b) the temporo-parietal junction (including the superior/mid temporal gyrus PGa/PGp expanding into the most caudal parts of PF and IPS), and (c) smaller clusters that fail to survive the cluster-size FWE correction in the cuneus/precuneus, cerebellum, inferior and middle frontal gyrus (incl. BA45 and BA44).   \n BGLM.   Regions with bGLM Intact\u202f>\u202fScrambled, and Scrambled\u202f>\u202fIntact. Contrasts were thresholded with t\u202f=\u202f3.87 and t\u202f=\u202f3.53 respectively, corresponding to the max (t \u202f=\u202f3.87, t \u202f=\u202f3.53) and max (t \u202f=\u202f3.19, t \u202f=\u202f3.53). Conventions as in  . \n  Table\u00a04   \n\n\n### Overlap between bGLM, AOEN and ToM circuit \n  \nAs for the ISC, the bGLM contrast identifying preferential activation for intact sequences (I\u2014S) revealed no overlap with the ToM network but did overlap (as the ISC I\u2014S did) substantially (985 voxels) with the AOEN in dorsal premotor and parietal (BA7, BA2, BA5L and IPS) regions ( ,   bottom panel).   \n BGLM & AOEN  . Overlap between bGLM (I\u202f>\u202fS) and the AOEN localizer. The bGLM (I\u2014S) and bGLM (S\u2014I) contrasts were inclusively masked in spm with the AOEN network described in the Supplementary Methods S1, and thresholded with t\u202f>\u202f3.87 for I\u2014S (max (tFDR\u202f=\u202f3.87, tunc\u202f=\u202f3.53)) and t\u202f>\u202f3.53 for S\u2014I (max (t \u202f=\u202f3.87, t \u202f=\u202f3.53)). Conventions as in  . \n  Table\u00a05   \n\nRegions showing preferential activation for scrambled sequences (bGLM S\u2014I) overlapped in 225 voxels with the ToM network around the temporo-parietal junction (including mainly the region PGa and superior and middle temporal gyrus), and minimally (20 voxels not surviving FWE correction) with the AOEN localizer in visual brain regions (Fusiform Gyrus) ( ,  ,   bottom panel).   \n BGLM (S  \u2014  I) & ToM areas.   Overlap between bGLM (S\u202f>\u202fI) and the ToM regions. The bGLM (S\u2014I) contrasts was inclusively masked in spm with the ToM network described in Mar et\u00a0al. (2011), and thresholded with t\u202f>\u202f3.53, which corresponds to the max (t \u202f=\u202f3.19, t \u202f=\u202f3.53). Conventions as in  . \n  Table\u00a06   \n\n\n### Network interactions in ISC (I\u2014S) \n  \nTo further characterize the brain regions showing sequence-level information (  ISC (I\u2014S) and  a), we explored the correlation across their time courses after averaging the time courses across all participants to isolate stimulus-triggered activity. As the right parietal cluster spanned too many cytoarchitectonic regions at the FDR-corrected threshold of t\u202f=\u202f3.93 and at FWE cluster-size correction (see first cluster in  ), we increased the threshold for this cluster to t\u202f=\u202f4.1, which caused it to split into three more homogeneous regions. A k-means clustering then revealed that the 10 ROIs segregate into three main networks of activity (shown as red, green and blue in  b) based on their cross-correlation pattern. The \u201cred\u201d network includes bilateral supramarginal clusters (including BA2 and PF), right inferior frontal gyrus (BA45), right precentral gyrus (BA44) and left insula. The \u201cblue\u201d network comprises right visual cortices (including areas V1, V2 and V3) and left angular and dorsal premotor cortices. The \u201cgreen\u201d network includes clusters in the bilateral superior parietal lobule (including 7A and 5L). Correlation between the Eigen-time courses of these three networks ( c) was positive between the red and the green networks and negative between the other pairs. \n\nIn order to have a better understanding of the kind of information encoded in these networks ( d\u2013f), we plotted the Eigen time course of each of the networks for each movie averaged across all subjects. By averaging the activity across all participants, one expects a flat line if activity is not synchronized across participants. The activity should peak, i.e. be positive or negative, if the stimulus contains information that triggers activity in the same direction across participants.  g\u2013i shows a matrix for Intact (left) and Scrambled (right) stimuli. Each row of the matrix corresponds to the brain activity triggered by a specific movie averaged across all subjects. To enable a more compact representation, the time course of activity is shown in a colour code rather than an activation line, with time along the x-axis, and colour intensity signalling the magnitude of activation. Warm colours signify positive, and cold colours negative, activations. To identify the time points at which a movie activated a network beyond what is expected by chance, we randomly permuted the labels of all the intact and scrambled movies, and averaged the activation. This procedure was repeated a thousand times. If a movie systematically triggered brain activity, one would then expect the averaged activity before permutation to have a peak that is taller than that after randomization. We therefore blanked all the parts of the matrix in which values remained within two standard deviations of the distribution of permuted data. All the parts whose values exceeded these bounds are shown in warm or cold colours. \n\nFinally, to examine whether there are systematic trends across all movies, we performed a grand-average across movies, and show it below the matrices together with the bounds obtained from permuted grand-average values (dotted lines in the figure). The length of the movies had been rescaled to facilitate averaging across movies. This procedure was repeated for each of the three networks. In the case of the intact movies, finding moments of significant excursion within a movie is unsurprising, given that the regions of interest were so selected as to have strong ISC for the intact movies. That the excursions remain significant   after   averaging across movies, however, indicates that the networks become synchronized consistently at specific moments of the movies. Interesting differences were noted in the timing between the three networks. The blue network, with its visual brain regions, is the first to show activation, while the other two networks are suppressed. This situation then reverses, with the activity of the green, and finally the red network becoming positive later in the movies. When processing the scrambled movies instead none of the networks shows significant deflections, except for the red network that shows negative ISC in the first part of the movie. We did not correct for multiple comparisons across time for this analysis because the analysis aimed at accurate identification of the points at which networks are most synchronized rather than just establish that they synchronize, which would be circular given the way the ROIs were selected. \n\n\n### Comparison of ISC and bGLM results \n  \nWe employed ISC and bGLM as streams of analysis leading to the identification of stimulus-locked and stimulus-induced activity respectively. To better understand the relation between these methods, we also extracted the parameter estimates of the bGLM from regions showing increased ISC, and ISC values from regions showing altered bGLM ( , top row). In each case, we plotted the parameter estimates (beta values) for the ISC on the   x  -axis and the bGLM values on the   y  -axis. For each ROI, we then show the value for the intact movie as a circle, and for the scrambled movie as a cross. For ROIs selected on the basis of increases in ISC, there is no point in statistically comparing the ISC value for intact and scrambled movies, as this would be circular. However, we tested for significant changes in the bGLM. The middle row of   shows significant changes with a solid line and insignificant changes with a dashed line. This analysis makes it clear that parietal regions of the red network (ROI 4 and 10) displayed increase in average brain activity and higher ISC in the intact than in the scrambled movies. At the same time, regions in the prefrontal cortex and visual regions (ROI 1, 6 and 8) showed reduced average activity and increased ISC. The other ROIs did not change their average activity level at all, despite changes in ISC. For ROIs selected on the basis of changes in bGLM, we tested the significance of the change in ISC. We see that most bGLM ROIs that show higher activity in the Intact condition ( , middle column) also show higher ISC. In contrast, none of the bGLM ROIs showing more activity in the scrambled condition showed significant changes in the ISC ( , rightmost column). This suggests that activity triggered specifically by the intact movies, as identified using a GLM, was stimulus-locked, and consequently led to increased ISC. Activity triggered specifically by the scrambled movies was instead stimulus-induced rather than stimulus-locked. The bottom row of   depicts the regions of overlap between ISC (I\u2014S) and bGLM (I\u2014S), and between ISC (S\u2014I) and bGLM(S\u2014I). It also shows that increases in ISC(I\u2014S) can overlap with both bGLM increases (I\u2014S) and decreases (S\u2014I).   \n The ISC \u2013 bGLM relation.   The top row depicts the ROIs corresponding to (from left to right) ISC, bGLM (I\u2013S) and bGLM (S\u2013I). The middle row the parameter estimates (\u03b2 weights) from the ISC (x-axis) and bGLM (y-axis) as a function of the Intact/Scrambled state of the movie for the ROIs shown above. Significant differences between intact and scrambled in the dimension that was not used to define the ROI is shown by solid lines, non-significant differences, by dotted lines. The bottom row shows the overlap between ISC(I-S) with bGLM (I\u2013S) and ISC(I-S) with bGLM (S\u2013I). The numbers correspond to the ROI and the subscript I/G indicates membership to ISC/bGLM, so that 4 2  indicates an overlap between ROI 4 of the ISC and ROI 2 of the GLM. \n  Fig.\u00a05   \n\n\n### Intact movies lead to faster and smaller EEG responses compared to scrambled movies \n  \nDifferent models of the mirror neuron system inspire different predictions about responses to individual motor acts depending on whether they are embedded in intact or scrambled sequences ( ). To test these predictions, we complemented the fMRI analyses with an analysis of electrophysiological responses triggered by each individual motor act, by aligning the EEG responses to the camera changes. The EEG data have higher temporal resolution. They also overcome the limitation of fMRI, viz., that inhibition might lead to an increase in BOLD due to the metabolic cost of the inhibition ( ).   shows the ERP that has been averaged across five distinct sets of EEG channels progressing from posterior to anterior channels. We found that the ERP for intact movies started rising faster than for the scrambled movies, which was visible in the difference curves ( , insets) as an initial red phase. We found that the ERP for intact movies had lower amplitude than that for the scrambled movies later in the ERP, which is visible as a blue phase in the difference curve.   \n ERP for the intact (red) and scrambled (red) conditions.   The inset below each ERP shows the difference curve (red for positive I-S and blue for negative) between intact and scrambled acts. The ERPs shown are also averaged across all the channels within the black shaded region shown on the sketch shown above each ERP. The channel groups enclose (a) OI1h, Oz, OI2h, O1, POO1, POO2, O2; (b) PO3, PPO1h, POz, PPO2h, PO4, P3, P1, Pz, P2, FP1, CPP5h, CPP3h, CPP1h, CPP2h, CPP4h, CPP6h; (c) CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CCP5h, CCP3h, CCP1h, CCP2h, CCP4h, CCP6h, C3, C1, Cz, C2, C4, FCC5h, FCC3h, FCC1h, FCC2h, FCC4h, FCC6h; (d) FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FFC3h, FFC1h, FFC2h, FFC4h, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4; (e) AF3, AFF1h, AFF2h, AF4, AFP1, AFz, AFP2. \n  Fig.\u00a06   \n\nTo quantify these observations, we performed two analyses. First, using two simple models fitted separately to each participant's ERPs, we explored the presence of a shift in latency and a difference in response magnitude. In Model 1, in which Scrambled(t)\u00a0=\u00a0Intact (t-\u03bb), we optimized \u03bb so as to reduce the residual error over the period from 0 to 300\u00a0ms in order to focus on the rising of the ERP and quantify the shift in latency. In Model 2, where Intact(t)\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b1*Scrambled(t), we optimized \u03b1 so as to reduce residual errors for t from 0 to 650\u00a0ms in oder to take the entire response into account and quantify the relative response magnitude. We then compared the fitted parameters against the null hypotheses \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a00 and \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a01 across participants using a cluster-based statistic (cf. the Method Section).  a shows a significant shift in response latency over occipital and parietal electrodes, with the intact condition leading to earlier responses (left panel) and a significant scaling over occipital, parietal and (left) frontal electrodes with the scrambled condition leading to larger responses. Second, we explored for time bins of 50\u202fms, which electrodes show higher ERPs to intact than scrambled movies ( b) to confirm observations from the difference curves of  . Results confirmed that during the first 250\u202fms, parietal and occipital electrodes show stronger responses to the intact movies, in line with the earlier rise time. From 250 to 400\u202fms, no significant differences were observed. The pattern then reverses, with the scrambled condition triggering larger ERPs from 400 to 650\u202fms over parietal and occipital electrodes. To provide an approximate mapping of the likely cortical sources for these differences at the electrode level, we performed a source localization of the ERP difference per time bin ( b right columns). The similarity of this source distribution over time suggests that a similar network of brain regions, including bilateral parietal and right visual cortices, is responsible for the earlier rise-time and reduced amplitude in the intact compared to the scrambled condition. (Given the limitations of source localization, we do not provide a coordinate table for these localizations).   \n Differences in ERP across conditions.   (a)   Topography of the parameters lamda (left) and alpha (right). Electrodes where lamda differs significantly from zero (with ERPs from Intact movies rising faster than those from Scrambled movies) or alpha differs significantly from one (with ERPs from Scrambled movies having higher magnitude) based on a cluster statistic are shown as red crosses. (b) Assessment of ERP differences as a function of time.   On the left the topoplot illustrates the difference in ERP between the intact and scrambled ERPs as a function of the time bin indicated. On the right side, a minimum norm source reconstruction of the difference. Blue indicates locations with Scrambled\u202f>\u202fIntact; yellow those were Intact\u202f>\u202fScrambled. In all cases, sensors with significant differences between Scrambled and Intact (corrected for multiple comparison using a cluster statistic at p\u202f<\u202f0.05) are marked in red. \n  Fig.\u00a07   \n\n and   report that within the visual system, feed-forward information and feed-back information across cortical regions increase coherence in the gamma band and the alpha/beta band, respectively. Taking stock from this observation, we compared the coherence between visual and supra-marginal ROIs (  c.f.   Methods) across the intact and scrambled movies. If intact movies lead to more feedback predictions and less feedforward prediction errors, and the observations of Fries and van Kerkoerle et\u00a0al. hold outside of the visual system, we would expect relatively more coherence in the alpha/beta band for intact, and more in the gamma band for scrambled movies. However, our analysis did not revealed any significant difference in coherence between these ROIs (q\u202f>\u202f0.01). \n\n\n### Intact movies lead to more mu-suppression at central electrodes \n  \nOur fMRI results suggest more consistent recruitment of the AOEN during intact movie processing than during the processing of scrambled movies. EEG power in the   mu-  band at central electrodes C3, C4 and Cz is considered a proxy for AOEN recruitment ( ;  ). During action observation and action execution, the power in the lower (\u00b110\u202fHz) and upper (\u00b120\u202fHz)   mu  -band is reduced in comparison to control conditions ( ), and reduced   mu  -power on a trial-to- trial basis co-occurs with higher BOLD signal in the AOEN ( ). We therefore hypothesized that   mu-  power at C3, C4 and Cz should be lower (more suppressed) during intact than scrambled movies, i.e., the power ratio power /power  should fall below 1 in the   mu  -range (10\u201320\u202fHz).   shows results that confirm this prediction. We found the power-ratio to be below 1 in the 10\u201320\u202fHz range in all the three electrodes over a range of time points relative to the camera change (  middle rows). Averaging power over time revealed significantly more   mu  -suppression for intact movies than for scrambled movies (i.e. power-ratio <1, q <0.05) from 8 to 22\u202fHz for C3, 10\u201320\u202fHz for C4, and 12\u201328\u202fHz in Cz (  bottom row).   \n Higher mu-suppression for intact than scrambled movies.   Time frequency decompositions were performed for intact (top row) and scrambled (second row) movies relative to the camera-change (t\u202f=\u202f0) for the three central electrodes C3 (left), Cz (middle) and C4 (right column). A   t  -test comparing for each time point and frequency the power-ratio I/S against 1 revealed less power in the I than S condition (i.e. negative t-values) in the mu band (10\u201320\u202fHz) over multiple time-points (3rd row). Thresholding this comparison at p <0.05 (red) or q <0.05 (yellow) reveals significant differences in the expected direction (i.e. ratio<1) over many time-points (4th row). The bottom row represents the power ratio obtained after averaging power over the entire time-window separately for each frequency and condition and then calculating the ratio (mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fsem across the 22 participants). The ratio I/S was then compared against 1 using a one-tailed   t  -test corrected for multiple comparison using q  <0.05. Time epochs of I/S\u202f<\u202f1 are then shown in yellow (q\u202f<\u202f0.05). \n  Fig.\u00a08   \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this experiment we set out to explore where and how the brain encodes sequence-level information when motor acts occur in sequences. Participants passively viewed a sequence of motor acts either in their natural, i.e., intact order or in a scrambled order. We measured their BOLD response using fMRI and their electrophysiological responses using EEG. \n\n### Mapping sequence level information using fMRI \n  \nRegions that show higher ISC during the processing of intact movies comprised three functional networks. One of these networks (\u201cblue\u201d network in  d) became active early in watching the movies. This network consisted of the right visual cortices (including area V1, V2 and V3), and the left angular (PG) and dorsal premotor cortices often jointly associated with stimulus-driven spatial attention within the dorsal attention network ( ;  ). The other two networks viz., the \u201cred\u201d and the \u201cgreen\u201d ones, were negatively correlated over time with the first network and became activated later when actions in the movies became more predictable. The red network in  e was formed by bilateral parietal clusters including (a) the PF complex in the rostral inferior parietal lobe, (b) the primary somatosensory cortex including BA2,1,3a, and 3b, (c) the secondary somatosensory cortex including PV and SII, (d) the rostral intraparietal sulcus, (e) the left mid-dorsal insula, (f) right inferior (BA44), and (g) mid-frontal gyri. Much of this network became activated during execution of actions. This network demonstrates strong similarities with the AOEN (see below). \n\nThe green network consists of the superior parietal lobule bilaterally (including 7A/PC and 5L) and has often been associated with the integration of vision, somato-sensation, and action ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nWe noted in the introduction that there is a difference of opinion in the neuroscience community as to whether information beyond single motor acts should fall within the AOEN or in the ToM network. We therefore wanted to investigate whether the three networks identified by us overlap with the AOEN and/or with the ToM network. \n\n\n### Overlap between sequence-level information and the AOEN \n  \nWe found substantial overlap within the regions included in our AOEN localizer. Regions of significantly higher ISC during intact movies within the AOEN consisted of most of the red network, and, in particular the bilateral large parietal clusters including the PF complex, SI and SII, as well as smaller frontal clusters in the right ventral premotor cortex (BA44) and left mid-dorsal insula. AOEN overlapped also with the green network in the superior parietal areas BA5 and BA7. Given that the intact and scrambled movies contained identical segments showing individual motor acts, if the AOEN were only to represent individual motor acts in isolation, we would expect the ISC to be identical in the two conditions. That the ISC was higher for the intact movies shows that the brain activity in these regions is also sensitive to the transitions between actions, providing evidence that this network contains information at the sequence level beyond individual motor acts. The   mu  -band in central EEG electrodes (C3, C4 and Cz), a putative proxy for AOEN activity ( ;  ), was more suppressed during the intact than during the scrambled movies. This phenomenon is further evidence that there is greater recruitment of the AOEN in the intact case than in the case of scrambled movies. \n\nMany of the regions of the red network in our human participants that overlap with the AOEN have homologues in the monkey brain that have been shown to contain mirror neurons. These include the human homologues of the following regions: (a) monkey premotor region F5 ( ; C  ;  ;  ), (b) monkey PF ( ;  ) and (c) monkey SII and adjacent sectors of SI ( ). This observation agrees with the predictions made by Hebbian learning models of the mirror neuron system that suggest that this system should encode the transitions between actions ( ). It should be noted that any stimulus triggered brain activity must have two features for it to translate into an increase in ISC. It must occur at the   same location   across individuals after normalization and smoothing and it must take place at approximately   the same time   across participants (Supplementary Materials). The significant ISC increase we observe in the AOEN thus suggests that information about the transition between acts in the AOEN has these features \u2013 at least to some extent. This is in line with the reliable timing observed in single mirror-neuron activity when observing single motor acts ( ;  ) and the consistency in the neural location activated by the sight of motor acts across individuals ( ). \n\nThe sensitivity of AOEN regions to the sequence in which motor acts are observed supports the findings of a small number of studies that other situational information capable of predicting future acts can also modulate mirror neuron activity.   have shown that if a monkey repeatedly witnesses someone grasping an object to bring it to the mouth, the activity of grasping mirror neurons is different from that in a context in which the monkey repeatedly sees someone grasp an object to place it in a container.   have shown that when an occluding screen is placed in front of a graspable object, seeing a hand disappear behind this screen leads to a higher discharge in mirror neurons sensitive to the grasping action than seeing it disappear behind a screen that was placed in front of an empty platform. Finally,  showed that the ventral premotor node of the AOEN in humans responds differently to grasping a cup with a background of objects suggesting drinking vs. a background of objects suggesting washing the cup. Taken together, these findings suggest that the AOEN can take preceding acts, the objects in the scene and the current situation into account in generating its response to the sight of a particular motor act, thereby demonstrating its possession of information that goes beyond single motor acts. Further support for an association between the AOEN, the mirror neuron system and sequence-level information is obtained from the fact that most of the regions that carried sequence-level information in our analysis of action observation data were also activated when participants themselves manipulated objects (\u201c*\u201d in  ) - a defining feature of mirror brain regions. \n\nThe green network also overlapped with the AOEN. Areas BA5 and BA7 are not typically considered part of the mirror neuron system. These regions have functional properties similar to those of monkey region VIP ( ;  ;  ). VIP neurons in monkey brains respond to (a) the haptic experience of touching an object with a specific body part, (b) the sight of objects close to and approaching that body part, and (c) the sight of another person being touched at the equivalent body part. VIP neurons, thus, can be said to provide a somatosensory analogue to traditional mirror neurons ( ). Neurons in this region have often been conceptualized as visually anticipating upcoming interactions between the body and objects (e.g.  ). Their vicarious activation during observation of similar actions performed by others ( ) endows them with similar anticipatory functions during the observation of action. It is therefore perhaps not surprising, that the human homologues of VIP are sensitive to sequence information during action observation. \n\n\n### Contributions of the ToM network \n  \nWe did not observe any overlap between changes in ISC and the ToM network. However, a bGLM analysis that compared the average activity during the entire movie in the intact version to that in the scrambled version revealed that some voxels in the ToM network show higher average activation in the scrambled condition though this did not translate into higher ISC in this network in that condition. As mentioned earlier (cf. Introduction), ISC requires activity to be stimulus-locked, i.e., to overlap in time across participants, while a bGLM does not (See Supplementary Excel Table\u00a0for the difference between ISC and bGLM). This suggests that in contrast to the AOEN that becomes preferentially recruited in a stimulus-locked way when acts are embedded in natural sequences, the ToM network becomes preferentially recruited when motor acts deviate from natural sequences and then at times that vary across participants. The greater activity level noticed in this network in the scrambled actions case agrees well with the observation that ToM brain regions go online when witnessing implausible actions ( ). That it is less stimulus-locked suggests that it reflects processes that are less automatic and more reflective, in line with the fact that parietal region PG is part of the default mode network that is associated with intrinsic rather than stimulus-driven cognition ( ). That different networks are recruited depending on whether sequences of acts are in natural or disturbed sequences suggests that the question whether sequence-level information is represented in the AOEN or in the ToM system is perhaps ill posed. Rather, these two systems are called up by sequence-level information under different circumstances ( ). \n\n\n### Evidence for inhibition of predictable visual responses \n  \nThe second aim of this project was to compare and contrast the predictions of different families of action observation models ( ). Our EEG data support inhibitory feedback models by showing that the amplitude and the latency of the brain's response to individual motor acts are less for the intact than for the scrambled versions. Source localization helps highlight the role of the parietal and visual cortices in generating these changes in timing and amplitude. On the basis of theoretical considerations alone, we had expected the   changes in amplitude   to be clearest over the visual cortex, and   changes in latencies   over parietal and premotor cortices \u2013 a separation that was not as evident in the EEG data which displayed both of these changes over occipital and parietal electrodes. The network identified in the source localization remained constant across time. This might either reflect the technical limitations of EEG in separating the activity of individual nodes or suggest that, in the sustained regime of activity induced by sequences of acts, the execution-observation network may begin to behave as one unified system rather than as a series of individual nodes with distinct temporal properties \u2013 a fact that is perhaps not surprising in a network with reciprocally connected nodes. \n\nHowever, over the slower temporal scale of fMRI, the visual and parietal nodes of the AOEN had distinguishable time courses that caused them to fall within separable networks, with the parietal nodes peaking in activity later than the visual nodes. With regard to the distinction between inhibitory feedback and excitatory feedback between parietal and visual cortices, an anti-correlation is observed between these fMRI networks. This observation agrees with the inhibitory-feedback model according to which the neural representation of observed actions should shift from visual brain regions to parietal and premotor regions that generate increasingly constrained and more accurate predictions based on the somatosensory and motor connectivity pattern of the participant's own actions in the intact sequences ( ). The bGLM also shows that a number of brain regions associated with visual processing show reduced BOLD signals during the processing of the intact sequences \u2013 a finding that is compatible with the notion of visual cortices receiving inhibitory feed-back in the context of intact sequences. Other models would not predict such negative correlations. In the temporal domain, we find that responses in the intact sequences occurs about 50\u2013100\u202fms earlier than in the scrambled situation ( a). The order of magnitude of this temporal shift is roughly in line with what could be expected from the literature on perceptual momentum, according to which, when we see an intact sequence of motions, our brain anticipates upcoming events tens of milliseconds in advance of their occurrence irrespective of whether they are inanimate objects ( ) or human actions ( ). Anticipation of this order of magnitude can also be observed in TMS experiments that measure motor facilitation to the vision of still frames that precede an action by \u223c100\u202fms ( ), and is in line with what we had predicted in theoretical accounts based on Hebbian learning ( ). \n\nHowever, our data are limited in their ability to establish predictive coding within the AOEN. First, our measurements are unable to establish that the motor system is the cause for (i) the attenuation and acceleration of the responses in occipital electrodes in the EEG data for intact sequences or (ii) our ability to predict observed actions. Although it is compatible with such causal relationships, we need neuromodulation and/or lesion studies to establish such a causal connection. ( ;  ). Secondly, a predictive coding framework posits that signals across visual and parietal cortices should provide   specific   predictions and prediction-errors about what action will come next, and how the observed action differs from these expectations \u2013 a specificity our data do not claim to have achieved yet. Designs in which we present sequences of actions that employ different body-parts (e.g. filling a glass with our   hands  , and then drinking it by ingesting it through the mouth) in combination with pattern classification ( ;  ) may be able to achieve greater specificity of these signals. Besides, predictive coding enables specific predictions about the direction of information flow across conditions. As fMRI is not a reliable source of information about the direction of information flow ( ), we have not looked for such directionality in our fMRI data. The high temporal resolution of EEG would make it more suitable for such analyses. However, volume conduction in EEG contaminates signals across nearby sources, which is probably why our coherence analyses failed to provide significant differences in coherence between the conditions. Repeating similar experiments in patients with electro-corticographic (ECoG) electrodes could overcome this limitation. Finally, neither fMRI nor EEG data provide direct measures of neuronal activity. For fMRI, reduced BOLD activity in the intact case compared to the scrambled condition probably reflects reduced metabolic demands, but whether this is due to a reduction in spiking in neurons representing the expected action remains unclear due to the complicated relation between neural inhibition and metabolism (for a critical discussion see  ). EEG also does not measure the spiking of neurons, but the temporal summation of synchronized EPSP and IPSPs in pyramidal neurons ( ). The attenuation of the ERP in the intact sequence could thus reflect reduced firing in the pyramidal neurons providing the output of the visual cortex, as predicted by the inhibitory feed-back model, but could also represent a desynchronization of this activity without change in the number of spikes. Experiments in which the activity of well-characterized neurons in the primate visual cortex is measured as the subjects observe both intact and scrambled sequences could help disambiguate some of the results of our non-invasive measurements reported here. \n\nHow the AOEN learns to encode information about transitions between acts is an interesting question albeit one that we cannot answer at the present stage of our work. Let us imagine an agent performing a sequence of acts A, B, and C. We know that systematic delays would occur between motor commands and sensory reafferences. When premotor or parietal regions trigger a motor command, there is a \u223c100\u202fms gap before the body part executes the action ( ), and another \u223c100\u202fms elapses before sensory information (visual, acoustic and somatosensory) travels back through sensory cortices to high-level cortices ( ,  ;  ). Hence, in the parietal cortex, when motor commands for act B are triggered, sensory re-afferent information about act A would still be encoded in the synaptic input due to the \u223c200\u202fms sensory-motor delays. This way, Hebbian synaptic learning would reinforce synaptic connections between sensory information about act A and motor commands about act B ( ). Given the way somatosensory and motor cortices are functionally interconnected during action observation ( ), we could conceive of sensory-motor loops that would represent the sequence of A->B, then from B->C, etc., based on the statistics of our own past actions. Studies of synaptic plasticity in animal models could test this hypothesis, and studies that vary the statistics of a participant's past action-transition-probabilities could test whether past motor experiences are indeed a significant source of these predictive signals. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur data suggest that when acts are arranged in sequences, the additional information is represented in separable networks depending on whether the sequences adhere or do not adhere to the statistics of natural actions. When acts adhere to the natural statistics of our own actions, regions overlapping with the AOEN encode sequence-level information in a stimulus-locked fashion. An inhibitory feedback architecture, i.e., one in which the visual processing of acts is inhibited by expectations derived from previous actions is then most compatible with the pattern of responses we observed: (a) a reduction of visually evoked responses in EEG, (b) a reduction in average BOLD activity in the visual cortex for intact compared to scrambled sequences and (c) a negative correlation between BOLD activity in the visual region and that in the AOEN nodes. \n\nWhen the order of the acts violates the natural statistics, brain regions associated with ToM seem to encode sequence-level information in a spatially consistent but temporally more variable way. This is seen in an increase of average BOLD activity without changes in ISC in this network. These findings call for more in-depth studies using brain activity manipulation and investigating lesions that could throw fresh light on whether sequence processing requires the AOEN when sequences fit natural statistics and ToM regions when they violate such statistics. \n\n\n## Declarations of interest \n  \nNone. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: tbl1\n### Label: Table\u00a01\nUnnamed:

The first column of the table also indicates whether a particular cluster survives family wise error correction at cluster level.From left to right: the cluster size in number of voxels and FWE; the number of voxels falling in a cyto-architectonic area; the percentage of the cluster that falls in the cyto-architectonic area; the activated hemisphere (L\u202f=\u202fleft; R\u202f=\u202fright); the name of the cyto-architectonic area when available or the anatomical description; the percentage of the area that is activated by the cluster; the t values of the peaks associated with the cluster followed by their MNI coordinates in mm; the number of the ROIs in Fig.\u00a04 to which the cluster corresponds (the first cluster was split in 3 by increasing the threshold to t\u202f>\u202f4.1).\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: tbl3\n### Label: Table\u00a03\nCluster size\t# Voxels in cyto\t%Cluster\tHem\tCyto or anatomical description\t%Area\tPeak Information\tPeak Information\tPeak Information\tPeak Information\nCluster size\t# Voxels in cyto\t%Cluster\tHem\tCyto or anatomical description\t%Area\tT\tx\ty\tz\nISC(I\u202f>\u202fS), max (tFDR\u202f=\u202f3.93, tunc\u202f=\u202f3.53)\u202f=\u202f3.93\tISC(I\u202f>\u202fS), max (tFDR\u202f=\u202f3.93, tunc\u202f=\u202f3.53)\u202f=\u202f3.93\tISC(I\u202f>\u202fS), max (tFDR\u202f=\u202f3.93, tunc\u202f=\u202f3.53)\u202f=\u202f3.93\tISC(I\u202f>\u202fS), max (tFDR\u202f=\u202f3.93, tunc\u202f=\u202f3.53)\u202f=\u202f3.93\tISC(I\u202f>\u202fS), max (tFDR\u202f=\u202f3.93, tunc\u202f=\u202f3.53)\u202f=\u202f3.93\tISC(I\u202f>\u202fS), max (tFDR\u202f=\u202f3.93, tunc\u202f=\u202f3.53)\u202f=\u202f3.93\tISC(I\u202f>\u202fS), max (tFDR\u202f=\u202f3.93, tunc\u202f=\u202f3.53)\u202f=\u202f3.93\tISC(I\u202f>\u202fS), max (tFDR\u202f=\u202f3.93, tunc\u202f=\u202f3.53)\u202f=\u202f3.93\tISC(I\u202f>\u202fS), max (tFDR\u202f=\u202f3.93, tunc\u202f=\u202f3.53)\u202f=\u202f3.93\tISC(I\u202f>\u202fS), max (tFDR\u202f=\u202f3.93, tunc\u202f=\u202f3.53)\u202f=\u202f3.93\n1170\t391.4\t33.5\tR\tAreaPFt (IPL)\t93.8\t\t\t\t\npFWE<0.000\t246.8\t21.1\tR\tArea2\t38\t\t\t\t\n\t98.1\t8.4\tR\tAreaPFop (IPL)\t42.9\t\t\t\t\n\t77\t6.6\tR\tArea1\t11\t\t\t\t\n\t68.9\t5.9\tR\tArea7PC(SPL)\t15.2\t\t\t\t\n\t59.9\t5.1\tR\tAreaPF(IPL)\t8.9\t6.03\t56\t\u221234\t46\n\t\t\tR\tAreaPF(IPL)\t\t5.91\t60\t\u221232\t46\n\t47.9\t4.1\tR\tAreahIP2(IPS)\t22.7\t\t\t\t\n\t39\t3.3\tR\tArea3b\t6.2\t4.42\t58\t\u221212\t24\n\t32.4\t2.8\tR\tArea7A (SPL)\t4.2\t5.64\t28\t\u221260\t64\n\t\t\tR\tArea7A (SPL)\t\t5.41\t24\t\u221258\t66\n\t20\t1.7\tR\tArea5L (SPL)\t2.7\t5.19\t22\t\u221256\t68\n\t12.4\t1.1\tR\tAreahIP3(IPS)\t2.7\t\t\t\t\n\t4.3\t0.4\tR\tArea3a\t2.1\t\t\t\t\n\t4.1\t0.4\tR\tAreaPFm(IPL)\t0.6\t\t\t\t\n\t2.5\t0.2\tR\tAreaOP4 [PV]\t0.8\t\t\t\t\n721\t368\t51\tL\tAreaPFt (IPL)\t63.1\t\t\t\t\npFWE<0.000\t145\t20.1\tL\tAreaPFop (IPL)\t65.3\t6.23\t\u221264\t\u221220\t26\n\t39.1\t5.4\tL\tAreaPF(IPL)\t7.5\t7.36\t\u221264\t\u221234\t36\n\t31.6\t4.4\tL\tAreaOP1 [SII]\t8.5\t\t\t\t\n\t25.1\t3.5\tL\tArea3b\t4.5\t\t\t\t\n\t21\t2.9\tL\tAreaOP4 [PV]\t5.8\t\t\t\t\n\t17.5\t2.4\tL\tArea1\t3.1\t\t\t\t\n\t5\t0.7\tL\tArea2\t0.9\t\t\t\t\n\t1.9\t0.3\tL\tAreaPFcm(IPL)\t0.6\t\t\t\t\n179\t104.8\t58.5\tR\tArea44\t17.5\t\t\t\t\npFWE<0.000\t\t\tR\tPrecentralGyrus\t\t5.91\t62\t8\t26\n173\t\t\tL\tRolandicOperculum\t\t5.71\t\u221240\t0\t14\npFWE<0.000\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n99\t58.1\t58.7\tL\tArea7A (SPL)\t4.6\t5.29\t\u221222\t\u221258\t64\npFWE<0.000\t29.1\t29.4\tL\tArea5L (SPL)\t4.2\t\t\t\t\n\t11.1\t11.2\tL\tArea7PC(SPL)\t6.5\t\t\t\t\n### Caption\nISC (I\u2014S) & AOEN.

Given that dopamine dysfunction could affect functional brain network efficiency, the present study utilized resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and graph theoretical approach to investigate the topological efficiency changes of the CBG motor network in patients with PD during a relatively hypodopaminergic state (12 hours after a last dose of dopamimetic treatment). We found that PD compared with controls had remarkable decreased efficiency in the CBG motor network, with the most pronounced changes observed in rostral supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), caudal SMA (SMA-proper), primary motor cortex (M1), primary somatosensory cortex (S1), thalamus (THA), globus pallidus (GP), and putamen (PUT). Furthermore, reduced efficiency in pre-SMA, M1, THA and GP was significantly correlated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores in PD patients. Together, our results demonstrate that individuals with PD appear to be less effective at information transfer within the CBG motor pathway, which provides a novel perspective on neurobiological explanation for the motor symptoms in patients. These findings are in line with the pathophysiology of PD, suggesting that network efficiency metrics may be used to identify and track the pathology of PD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by a specific array of motor symptoms, including slowness of movement, rigidity, tremor at rest and postural instability  . The core pathophysiological mechanism is degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), which is thought to cause abnormal modulation of cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuits  . The CBG loops describe four parallel circuits classified as motor, oculomotor, limbic, and associative according to cortical territories to which they connect  ,  . Specially, the CBG motor pathway that focuses principally on the putamen (PUT) and its connections projects somatotopically from the primary motor cortex (M1), lateral premotor cortex (LPMC), supplementary motor area (SMA), and primary somatosensory cortex (S1, Brodmann areas 3, 1 and 2) to the PUT; then throughout the thalamus (THA) projects back to these cortical motor areas  . The dysfunction of the CBG motor circuit underlies the classical motor signs and symptoms of PD  . \n\nPrevious neuroimaging studies in PD have elucidated that the constituent regions within the CBG motor loop are typically hypoactivated (e.g. SMA and PUT) or hyperactivated (e.g. M1 and LPMC) during performance of motor tasks  ,  ,  ,  , as well as display local changes  ,  ,   and altered functional integrity  ,  ,  ,  ,   in resting brain function. There is also evidence that PD had anatomical connectivity deficits in the CBG motor pathway  . Those findings provide support for the notion that PD is primarily marked by CBG motor circuit dysfunction. Although functional and anatomical alterations in the CBG motor pathway observed in PD patients, the topological changes within the entire loop remain largely obscure. According to former research, the neurodegenerative processes for PD are not diffuse, random, or confluent, but instead target specific large-scale neural networks  ,  ,  . This indicates that taking a network perspective on PD could be fundamental for understanding the pathophysiology of this disease. Thus, studies of the CBG motor network topology are imperative for comprehending the pathophysiological models contributing to the motor symptoms of PD. \n\nRecent advances in graph theoretical approaches have allowed us to probe intrinsic functional network breakdown in PD group  ,  ,  . Using the graph theoretical measure of a node's degree, Wu and his colleagues   studied the interaction of motor network in PD patients, demonstrating disrupted functional connectivity patterns of the motor network in PD at resting state. The motor network, defined in their study, depends on a movement session, which is distinguished from the CBG motor circuit. Here the CBG motor pathway, as delineated in prior research, comprises (1) several cortical motor areas, including the M1, LPMC (dorsal and ventral LPMC), SMA (pre-SMA in the rostral portion and SMA-proper in the caudal portion), and S1, (2) the PUT, which is \u2018input\u2019 stage of the basal ganglia and receives projections from the cortical motor areas, (3) the globus pallidus (GP) that receives input from the PUT and sends projections to the THA, and (4) the THA, which receives projections from the internal segment of the GP and in turn projects back to the cortical motor areas  ,  ,  . The present study will confine regions of interest (ROIs) to this part. In addition to node's degree, network efficiency metrics also prove to be a useful means for identifying and tracking the pathophysiology of PD  ,  . By taking advantage of this index, investigators found that PD patients had remarkable decreased global and nodal efficiency compared to healthy age-matched controls. Despite these advances, it remains uncertain how topological efficiency changes in the CBG motor network in patients with PD. The above question that we raised rests on two facts. First, the pharmacological blockade of dopamine neurotransmission in healthy adults causes decreased global and nodal network efficiency  , implying that dopamine dysfunction affects brain network efficiency. Second, the CBG motor circuit, which focuses primarily on the PUT and its connections, is heavily depleted of dopamine in PD  ,  . Given the above, it is tempting to hypothesize that PD patients in a relatively dopamine-depleted state (\u201cdrug-off\u201d) would display efficiency alterations in the CBG motor network. \n\nTo address the above hypothesis, we combined resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) with graph theoretical approach to examine voxel-level efficiency on the CBG motor circuit which was constituted from pre-SMA, SMA-proper, dorsal LPMC, ventral LPMC, M1, S1, PUT, GP and THA  ,  ,  , in patients with PD. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nData was acquired at Southwest Hospital of the Third Military Medical University. Thirty-seven right-handed PD patients (17 males) were recruited for the study. The clinical diagnosis of PD was confirmed according to the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria   by an experienced neurologist. Exclusion criteria were moderate-severe head tremor, cognitive dysfunction (Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) was \u226528 in our sample), other neurological diseases (such as severe head trauma or stroke), and general exclusion criteria for MRI scanning (such as claustrophobia, pace-maker, and implanted metal parts). The experiments were carried out in the evening, at least 12 h after the last dose of dopaminergic medication. Each Patient's disease severity was assessed using the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stages and the motor examination of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III)  . The average disease stage using the H&Y score was 2.1\u00b10.7 (maximum stage is 5), and the average disease severity using the UPDRS-III was 19.17\u00b19.22 in this study. The median H&Y stage was 2, which refers to \u201cbilateral disease, without impairment of balance.\u201d Only mild to moderate stage patients were enrolled in the study to ensure compliance with the long scan time. Thirty-four age- and gender-matched healthy controls (22 males) were recruited from a volunteer database. All control subjects had a normal neurological status without history of neurological or psychiatric diseases. The MMSE was \u226528 in controls, and there was no difference between the patients and healthy subjects. The clinical data of PD patients are shown in  . \n   Demographic and clinical characteristics of the PD and HC groups.        \nAll participants gave written informed consent to the research protocol, which was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the Third Military Medical University (Chongqing, China). Ethics review criteria conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Image Acquisition \n  \nFunctional images were acquired on a 3.0 T Siemens Tim Trio whole-body MRI system (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). Subjects were instructed simply to rest with their eyes closed, not to think of anything in particular, and not to fall asleep. Imaging data were collected transversely by using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following settings: TR\u200a=\u200a2000 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a30 ms, flip angle\u200a=\u200a90\u00b0, FOV\u200a=\u200a192\u00d7192 mm , slices\u200a=\u200a36, in-plane matrix\u200a=\u200a64\u00d764, thickness\u200a=\u200a3 mm, no slice gap, voxel size\u200a=\u200a3.0\u00d73.0\u00d73.0 mm . For each subject, a total of 240 volumes were acquired, resulting in a total scan time of 480 s. Three-dimensional T1-weighted anatomical images were collected sagittally using the following volumetric 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence (TR\u200a=\u200a1900 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a2.52 ms, flip angle\u200a=\u200a9\u00b0, slice thickness\u200a=\u200a1 mm, slices, 176, FOV\u200a=\u200a256\u00d7256 mm , matrix size\u200a=\u200a256\u00d7256 and voxel size\u200a=\u200a1\u00d71\u00d71 mm ) on each subject. \n\n\n### Image preprocessing \n  \nImage preprocessing was carried out using statistical parametric mapping software (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuro-Science, London, UK). Briefly, the first 10 volumes were not analyzed allowing for magnetization stabilization. The remaining 230 consecutive images were corrected for the acquisition delay between slices and for the head movement. Subjects whose head motion parameters exceed more than 1.5 mm maximum translation displacement in x, y or z and 1.5  of angular motion were excluded from further analysis. In current study, no participants were excluded based on this criterion. After slice acquisition correction and head motion correction, the functional images were normalized to the standard SPM8 echo-planar imaging template, resampling to 3.0\u00d73.0\u00d73.0 mm . \n\nIn addition, the following steps were also performed to remove possible spurious variances from the data through linear regression: six parameters obtained by rigid body correction of head motion, averaged signals from CSF, averaged signals from white matter, and averaged signals from whole brain. To reduce the effect of low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise, linear detrending and temporal band-pass filtering (0.01\u20130.08 Hz) were then performed. \n\n\n### Voxel-wise efficiency map of the CBG motor network \n  \nTo obtain the voxel-wise efficiency map of the CBG motor network, we performed the following steps ( ). \n   Schematic illustration of analysis.  \nWe first constructed functional connectivity network (step A\u2013D) within the CBG motor network (A) at voxel-wise scale (B), and optimal sparsity threshold was estimated and applied (D). Once network was constructed, efficiency for each node was computed and efficiency map for each subject was generated (E). \n  \n1) CBG motor network reconstruction. The CBG motor circuit comprised the cortical areas pre-SMA, SMA-proper, dorsal LPMC, ventral LPMC (SMA and LPMC corresponds to Brodmann area 6), M1 (Brodmann area 4), S1 (Brodmann areas 1, 2, and 3), as well as subcortical structures PUT, GP and THA  ,  . We selected Brodmann areas 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, PUT, GP and THA as ROIs using the software WFU-pickAtlas (Wake Forest University)  ,  ,  . Each ROI was defined in the Talairach Daemon (TD) Brodmann area atlases  , and the CBG motor network was generated by combination of the respective template. Each voxel within the CBG motor circuit was then defined as network nodes (N\u200a=\u200a8246). The edges between each pair nodes were constructed by computing Pearson correlation coefficients between the preprocessed time series of every pair of voxels in the CBG motor circuit, individually for each subject. Then, multiple comparison correction was performed on all correlation links in each subject using Bonferroni correction, with p<0.05, resulting in a sparse correlation matrix for each subject. \n\n2) Network efficiency. As previous studies suggested that the brain networks of each subject normally differ in both the number and weighting of the edges, we applied a matching strategy to characterize the network efficiency  . Both the global and local network efficiencies have a propensity for being higher with greater numbers of edges in the graph  . Modifying the sparsity values (number of edges) of the adjacency matrix also altered the graph's structure. As a consequence it was suggested that the graphs to be compared must have (a) the same number of nodes and (b) the same number of edges  . The sparsity was defined as the ratio of the number of existing edges divided by the maximum possible number of edges in a network. Sparsity value of each subject's sparse correlation matrix was calculated (ranged from 0.0031 to 0.0493). The minimum sparsity value (sparsity\u200a=\u200a0.0031) was selected as the final sparsity threshold, which was used to generate thresholded functional connectivity network (FCN) for each subject. This sparsity threshold (0.0031) guaranteed that all thresholded FCNs have the same number of correlation links, and all those correlation links could survive Bonferroni correction. Finally, global and nodal efficiency was carried out on these thresholded FCNs using the brain connectivity toolbox (BCT,  ). As proposed by Bullmore et al.  , the global efficiency was calculated as:  , where N is the number of nodes, and   is defined as the path length between node   i   and node   j   with the shortest length. The nodal efficiency was computed as the inverse of the harmonic mean of the minimum path length ( ) between an index node,   i  , and all other nodes in the network:  . \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nBefore statistical analysis, all efficiency maps were spatially smoothed (FWHM\u200a=\u200a4 mm) in SPM8 to minimize the difference of functional anatomy of brain across subjects. \n\nTwo-tailed two-sample t-test with three covariates (age, gender and mean displacement) was implemented in SPM8 to map group efficiency difference (PD vs. healthy controls). The mean displacement was controlled, for the evidences indicated that head motion was a confounding factor on functional connectivity measures  . Statistical significance was based on false discovery rate (FDR) multiple comparison correction (p<0.05). \n\nSpearman correlation analysis of nodal efficiency at each altered brain region against the UPDRS motor score was performed in PD group. The statistical level with p<0.05 was considered as significant. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Voxel-wise efficiency map of the CBG motor network \n  \nCompared with healthy controls, PD exhibited significantly decreased (FDR correction, p<0.05) efficiency in the CBG motor network, especially the reduced nodal efficiency in the left SMA-proper, right pre-SMA, and bilateral M1, postcentral gyrus (S1), THA, PUT and GP ( , brain areas with blue color;  ) was observed. We did not found any brain areas showing significant increased efficiency in PD. \n   Brain regions with blue color indicated significant (FDR multiple comparison correction, p<0.05) decreases of efficiency map in PD relative to healthy control using two-tailed two sample t test with age, gender and frame-wise displacement as covariance.  \nThose regions were presented in axial view. HC, healthy control; PD, Parkinson's disease. \n     Brain regions showing marked difference of efficiency between PD and HC.        \n\n### Correlation between efficiency and UPDRS motor score \n  \nSpearman correlation analysis revealed that, in the patient group, the global efficiency was significantly negative correlated with UPDRS motor score (r\u200a=\u200a\u22120.4464, p\u200a=\u200a0.0056). Specially, the left M1, right pre-SMA, bilateral THA, and bilateral GP exhibiting significantly decreased efficiency showed negative correlation with UPDRS motor score ( ). \n   Association of UPDRS motor score with nodal efficiency value in brain areas obtained from comparison of efficiency map between the two groups.  \nUPDRS motor score was significantly correlated with efficiency value in the left M1, right pre-SMA, bilateral GP and THA (p<0.05). The r  donates the spearman correlation coefficient. M1, primary motor cortex; pre-SMA, pre-supplementary motor area; GP, globus pallidus; THA, thalamus. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study was designed to explore topological efficiency of the CBG motor network in PD patients during resting state. We found that PD had significantly decreased efficiency in the CBG motor pathway, with the most pronounced changes in right pre-SMA, left SMA-proper, and bilateral M1, S1, THA, GP and PUT. Additionally, correlation analysis revealed that reduced efficiency of brain areas with right pre-SMA, left M1, bilateral GP and THA showed negative relationship with UPDRS motor score. These findings suggest that PD patients are less effective at parallel information processing across the CBG motor pathway, which give further insight into understanding of the pathophysiology contributing to the motor symptoms in PD. \n\nBullmore and Achard found that dopamine blockade in healthy adults led to decreased global and nodal network efficiency  . Skidmore et al. reasoned therefore that individuals with PD characterized in part by decreased dopaminergic activity had reduced global and nodal efficiency  . To our knowledge, the CBG motor circuit is most severely depleted of dopamine in PD. A marked decline efficiency in the CBG motor network found here, thus, may be tied to the physiology of PD. A possible mechanism underlying this finding could attribute to the destruction of gain setting nuclei in the brain (ie, brainstem and hypothalamus) in PD patients  ,  . The gain setting nuclei use a large group neurochemicals including the dopamine to assist neural systems in flexibly initiating, maintaining, and altering function within the network  . These robust systems initially respond to the disease process by actively remodeling, with uninjured or less injured neurons altering output fields to maintain system function. However, with progressive disease (typically as >50\u201375% of dopaminergic neurons are lost), capacity of the gain setting nuclei to effectively remodel and compensate may be overwhelmed. It is possible therefore that decreased network efficiency in individuals with PD is related to the general underlying destruction of gain setting nuclei. However, further studies are needed to confirm these statements and uncover the mechanisms behind the association of reduced network efficiency and the dysfunction of gain setting nuclei. \n\nReduced efficiency in the cortical motor areas right pre-SMA, left SMA-proper and bilateral M1 is consistent with earlier findings reported by Skidmore and colleagues  . Resting state functional connectivity changes  ,  ,  ,   and task-related hypoactivation  ,  ,   of those regions have been found in patients with PD. Decreased efficiency in the pre-SMA and SMA-proper adds to a growing literature which suggests that dysfunction of the SMA due to the deficit of the nigrostriatal dopamine system may underlie akinesia in PD  . In addition, efficiency reduction in the M1 may provide further evidence for the notion that the hypoactivity in the M1 is in line with the classical models of the basal ganglia cortex loop  . \n\nDecreased efficiency in PD includes the postcentral gyrus (S1). The S1 plays a critical role of sensory feedback in motor planning and execution  . The microstructural degradation of the S1 detected in PD patients are associated with PD-related sensory response abnormalities  . Sensory deficits in PD are probably attributed to disease-related dopaminergic denervation which causes a loss of sensory response specificity, resulting in transmission of noisier and less differentiated information to cortical regions  . The current finding indicates that patients with PD are less effective at information transmission in S1 cortical area, which could prove the point mentioned above. \n\nThe THA that occupies a pivotal position in the CBG circuits  ,   displayed decreased efficiency in PD patients. There are two possible explanations for the THA dysfunction in PD. One holds that the dysfunction of the THA in PD as a consequence of SNc degeneration. However, it is also possible that the THA undergoes structural changes  ,  , displays functional abnormalities  ,  , and may be a site of direct disease pathology in PD  ,  ,  . The THA plays a central role in the pathological models of PD or just relays pathological signals from the dopamine-deprived striatum through to the motor cortices, which remain uncertain. Further study on understanding the thalamic changes in the CBG networks underlying movement and cognitive functions would seem paramount, in order to develop more relevant therapeutic options for patients with PD. \n\nThe GP was found to exhibit reduced efficiency in PD. GP is an indispensible part in the CBG motor loop, which receives input from the PUT and sends projections to the THA  . In animal models of PD, neuronal activity is increased in the internal segment of the GP, and lesions of the structure result in marked improvement in motor function  . Studies in patients with PD suggest that the GP provides an opportune target structure to investigate the mechanisms of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on parkinsonian limb bradykinesia and rigidity  ,  . The above indicates that dysfunction of the GP accounts for motor deficits of PD patients. Recent neuroimaging findings with PD provide further evidence for the aforementioned argument  ,  ,  . For instance, pallidal dopamine depletion correlated with parkinsonian tremor   and reduced activity in this region related to locomotor dysfunction  . Our result reaffirmed dysfunction of the GP involved in motor symptom in PD. \n\nPD patients also found to show declined efficiency in the PUT. It is generally believed that PD patients represent reduced dopamine uptake in the striatum and the most severely affected region is the PUT  . The PUT connected closely with the SMA and M1 is thought to be involved mainly in motor functions  . Abnormality of this region, thus, results in motor symptoms in PD. For example, akinetic-rigid PD patients show more severe dopaminergic neuron cell loss in the ventrolateral part of the SNc that projects to the dorsal PUT  . In addition, the dysfunction of the PUT correlates with clinical scores of akinesia in PD  . The current finding indicates less efficient information processing in the PUT, which could also be responsible for the akinesia in PD. \n\nMoreover, decreased efficiency in the right pre-SMA, left M1, bilateral GP, and THA was correlated negatively with UPDRS motor scores in patients. Given that dopamine depletion plays an important role in decreased network efficiency in patients with PD, we infer that, with progressive disease, a depletion of the neurotransmitter dopamine become severe and the information processing in these regions are less effective. This, in turn, may contribute to the motor impairments in PD. \n\nThe present study investigated the pattern of efficiency degradation in the CBG motor network, which demonstrates decreased topological efficiency of the CBG motor network in PD. We interpret these findings as acute dopamine depletion in our PD sample during a relatively dopamine-depleted state (ie, \u201cdrug-off\u201d). Nevertheless, more evidences are needed to confirm whether this change is owing to dopamine deficiency and administration of levodopa can relatively normalize the network efficiency. To further understanding the network efficiency alteration in PD, rs-fMRI study should conduct again during a dopamine-replete state (ie, \u201cdrug on\u201d). \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn summary, we aimed to investigate topological efficiency changes of the CBG motor circuit in patients with PD. This purpose relays on two facts. First, the dopamine dysfunction affects functional network efficiency. Second, the CBG pathway is severely depleted of dopamine in PD. To achieve the above issues, rs-fMRI and graph theoretical approach were applied to measure PD-related changes in topological efficiency of the CBG motor network. The results indicate that reduced efficiency in SMA, M1, THA, GP and PUT disturbs the balance of information transmission in the CBG motor loop, which could be linked with akinesia and rigidity in PD  . Our findings further suggest that network efficiency metrics provides useful means to study the pathophysiology of PD \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone-0108124-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tPD (n\u200a=\u200a37)\tHC (n\u200a=\u200a34)\tP value\nAge, year (mean\u00b1SD)\t58.68\u00b113.10\t55.59\u00b110.55\t0.28???\nGender, F/M\t20/17\t12/22\t0.18???\nHandedness\tR\tR\t\nDisease duration (years)\t3.87\u00b13.10\t\u2013\t\nH&Y (off mediation)\t2.1\u00b10.7\t\u2013\t\nUPDRS motor score(off medication)\t19.17\u00b19.22\t\u2013\t\n### Caption\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the PD and HC groups.\n### Footer\naThe p value was calculated using two-tail two-sample t test.bThe p value was calculated using chi-squared test.PD, Parkinson's disease; HC, healthy control; R, right.\n\n\n## ID: pone-0108124-t002\n### Label: Table 2\nBrain regions\tMNI Coordinates\tMNI Coordinates\tMNI Coordinates\tCluster size\tT value\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tx\ty\tz\tUnnamed: 4_level_1\tUnnamed: 5_level_1\nPD<HC\tPD<HC\tPD<HC\tPD<HC\tPD<HC\tPD<HC\nL PoCG\t\u221248\t\u22129\t27\t356\t\u22124.24???\nR PoCG\t51\t\u22129\t27\t186\t\u22124.35???\nL M1\t\u221254\t\u22123\t33\t391\t\u22124.11???\nR M1\t45\t\u221212\t39\t270\t\u22123.79???\nL SMA-proper\t\u22123\t\u221218\t54\t121\t\u22122.90???\nR pre-SMA\t6\t3\t57\t219\t\u22123.96???\nL PUT\t\u221221\t3\t6\t189\t\u22122.93???\nR PUT\t27\t3\t\u22126\t193\t\u22123.49???\nL THA\t\u221215\t\u22126\t6\t176\t\u22123.26???\nR THA\t6\t\u22129\t0\t141\t\u22123.45???\nL GP\t\u221212\t3\t3\t65\t\u22123.72???\nR GP\t24\t3\t\u22123\t56\t\u22123.31???\n### Caption\nBrain regions showing marked difference of efficiency between PD and HC.\n### Footer\n\u2020FDR multiple comparison correction (p<0.05, cluster size>50).PD, Parkinson's disease; HC, healthy control; L, left; R, right; PoCG, postcentral gyrus; M1, primary motor cortex; SMA-proper, supplementary motor area-proper; pre-SMA, pre-supplementary motor area; PUT, putamen; THA, thalamus; GP, globus pallidus.\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4184784, "text_md5": "92843ddff1caf46380b244cf262afcca", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 116], "journal": [117, 125], "publication_year": [127, 131], "title": [142, 263], "keywords": [277, 277], "abstract": [290, 1683], "body": [1692, 24861], "tables": [24874, 26409]}, "batch": 4, "pmid": 25279557, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0108124", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4184784", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4184784"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4184784\">4184784</a>", "list_title": "PMC4184784  Reduced Topological Efficiency in Cortical-Basal Ganglia Motor Network of Parkinson's Disease: A Resting State fMRI Study"}

In language, perceptual information can also be used to describe abstract semantic concepts like a \u201crising income\u201d (space) or a \u201csquare personality\u201d (shape). Despite being inherently concrete, co-speech gestures depicting space and shape can accompany concrete or abstract utterances. Here, we investigated the way that abstractness influences the neural processing of the perceptual categories of space and shape in gestures. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that the neural processing of perceptual categories is highly dependent on language context. In a two-factorial design, we investigated the neural basis for the processing of gestures containing shape (SH) and spatial information (SP) when accompanying concrete (c) or abstract (a) verbal utterances. During fMRI data acquisition participants were presented with short video clips of the four conditions (cSP, aSP, cSH, aSH) while performing an independent control task. Abstract (a) as opposed to concrete (c) utterances activated temporal lobes bilaterally and the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) for both shape-related (SH) and space-related (SP) utterances. An interaction of perceptual category and semantic abstractness in a more anterior part of the left IFG and inferior part of the posterior temporal lobe (pTL) indicates that abstractness strongly influenced the neural processing of space and shape information. Despite the concrete visual input of co-speech gestures in all conditions, space and shape information is processed differently depending on the semantic abstractness of its linguistic context. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIn face-to-face communication people often use gestures to complement the content of their verbal message. People produce different kinds of gestures (McNeill,  ), such as iconic gestures illustrating shape (e.g., \u201cThe ball is round\u201d) or deictic gestures referring to spatial information in our physical environment (e.g., \u201cThe cat is sitting on the roof\u201d; pointing gesture). Shape gestures resemble the information they convey, as when someone draws a circle in the air to indicate a round shape (\u201cThe table in the kitchen is round,\u201d circle gesture). Space and shape gestures typically refer to concrete entities in the world. However, they can also make abstract references depending on the nature of the verbal message (McNeill,  ; McNeill et al.,  , ). For instance, shape-related gestures can illustrate a deep connection between twins when the speaker touches the fingertips of both hands (\u201cThe twins had a spiritual bond between them\u201d). Similarly space-related gestures can refer to abstract relationships or locations such as lifting the hand when saying that the discussion occurred at a very \u201chigh level.\u201d \n\nIn direct face-to-face communication people use gestures (Ozyurek and Kelly,  ), regardless of whether the utterances are concrete or abstract. In line with theories suggesting gestures may represent the phylogenetic origin of human speech (Corballis,  ,  ,  ; Gentilucci and Corballis,  ; Gentilucci et al.,  ; Bernardis et al.,  ), gestures might represent the basis of spatial or action representations in human language [for example, see Tettamanti and Moro ( )]. Such spatial elements transferred into speech and gestures could be an expression of how our language is rooted in embodied experiences (Gibbs,  ; Lakoff,  ). Following this idea perceptual elements and the sensory-motor system might both contribute to the processing and comprehension of figurative abstract language (particularly in the context of metaphors such as \u201cgrasp an idea\u201d), as suggested by the embodiment theory (Gallese and Lakoff,  ; Arbib,  ; Fischer and Zwaan,  ; D'Ausilio et al.,  ; Pulverm\u00fcller and Fadiga,  ). Thus, the investigation of the neural substrates underlying the processing of perceptual categories such as shape or space in the context of concrete vs. abstract language semantics would give an answer to this hypothesis. \n\nRecent fMRI investigations have focused on the processing of speech and gesture for different gesture types beat gestures: (Hubbard et al.,  ); iconic gestures: (Willems et al.,  ,  ); and metaphoric gestures: (Kircher et al.,  ; Straube et al.,  ,  ). In general, left hemispheric posterior temporal (Holle et al.,  ,  ; Green et al.,  ) and inferior frontal brain regions (Willems et al.,  ; Kircher et al.,  ; Straube et al.,  ,  ) are commonly found for the semantic processing of speech and gesture. The left posterior temporal lobe (pTL) seems to be involved during the apprehension of co-verbal gestures, whereas the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) seems to be additionally recruited when processing gestures in an abstract sentence context (Kircher et al.,  ; Straube et al.,  ,  ) or when accompanying incongruent (\u201cThe fisherman has caught a huge fish,\u201d while the actor is angling his arms) concrete speech (Willems et al.,  ; Green et al.,  ; Willems et al.,  ). However, these studies do not examine the neural effects of processing of concrete or abstract utterances with different perceptual categories, such as gestures referring to shape (e.g., \u201cThe ball is round\u201d) or space (e.g., \u201cThe shed is next to the building\u201d). \n\nIn a previous study, we compared brain activation in response to object-related (non-social) and person-related (social) co-verbal gestures (Straube et al.,  ). Person-related as opposed to object-related gestures activated anterior brain regions including the medial and bilateral frontal cortex as well as the temporal lobes. These data indicate that dependent of speech and gesture content (person-related vs. object-related) different brain regions are activated during comprehension. However, in the aforementioned study the content of the verbal utterances was confounded by differences in the level of abstractness, since person-related gestures are not only social, but also more abstract symbolic than object-related gestures (e.g., \u201cThe actor did a good job in the play\u201d). Therefore, the specific influence of person-related and object-related content independent of abstractness was not disentangled. \n\nBeside this evidence for a posterior to anterior gradient of processing for concrete to abstract speech-gesture information, it is generally assumed that specific regions of the brain are specialized for the processing of specific kinds of contents (Patterson et al.,  ). Information about shapes of objects are processed in lateral occipital and inferior temporal brain areas (e.g., Kourtzi and Kanwisher,  ; Grill-Spector et al.,  ; Kourtzi and Kanwisher,  ; Kourtzi et al.,  ; Panis et al.,  ; Karnath et al.,  , whereas the parietal lobe is involved in processing of spatial information (Rizzolatti et al.,  ,  ; Koshino et al.,  ,  ; Rizzolatti and Matelli,  ; Chica et al.,  ; Gillebert et al.,  ). Although gestures can be distinguished by perceptual category [e.g., deictic gestures convey spatial information and iconic gestures predominantly convey shape information (McNeill,  )] there is insufficient knowledge about the neural processing of these different perceptual categories in the context of abstract and concrete sentence contexts. \n\nHere we investigate the way in which perceptual category and semantic abstractness of co-verbal gestures interact. Our experiment aims at the question whether different perceptual categories are processed in the same or in distinct brain regions, irrespective of their linguistic abstractness. To approach this research question, we applied a naturalistic approach comparing shape-related and space-related gestures in the context of concrete and abstract sentences. \n\nOn a cognitive level (concrete physical) gesture content has to be aligned with the content of speech, regardless of whether the message is concrete or abstract. We hypothesize that the effort to incorporate both abstract speech with concrete gestures will likely result in enhanced neural responses in the left inferior frontal cortex (Willems et al.,  ) and in bilateral temporal brain regions (Kircher et al.,  ) as compared to the concrete conditions, independent of perceptual category. With regard to shape-related and space-related gestural information we expected differential activation within the inferior temporal and parietal lobe, respectively. For the interaction of perceptual (space and shape) and semantic category (concreteness and abstractness) two alternative results were hypothesized: (1) If the same neural processes are engaged when processing shape and space information regardless of the abstractness of the message, we will find no significant activation in interaction analyses. In this case, conjunction analyses (e.g., aSP > aSH \u2229 cSP > cSH) will result in common activation patterns in the parietal cortex for space and inferior temporal cortex for shape. (2) If abstractness influences the processing of shape-related and space-related gesture information, interaction analyses will show differential activations between conditions. Here, we expected an interaction since language content may differentially influence the interpretation of perceptual categories and consequently the neural processing predominantly in the left IFG and pTL. Enhanced neural responses in classical \u201clanguage regions\u201d would strengthen the assumption that perceptual categories are differentially processed if embedded into an abstract vs. concrete language context. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSeventeen male right handed (Oldfield,  ) healthy volunteers, all native speakers of German (mean age = 23.8 \u00b1 2.7 years, range: 20\u201330 years, mean years of school education = 12.65 \u00b1 0.86, range: 10\u201313 years), without impairments of vision or hearing, participated in the study. None of the participants had any serious medical, neurological or psychiatric illness, past or present. All participants gave written informed consent and were paid 20 Euro for participation. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Because of technical problems one fMRI-data set was excluded from the analyses. \n\n\n### Stimulus construction \n  \nA set of 388 short video clips depicting an actor was initially created, consisting of 231 concrete and 157 abstract sentences, each accompanied by co-verbal gestures. \n\nIconic gestures refer to the concrete content of sentences, whereas metaphoric gestures illustrate abstract information in sentences. For example in the sentences \u201cTo get down to business\u201d (drop of the hand) or \u201cThe politician builds a bridge to the next topic\u201d (depicting an arch with the hand), abstract information is illustrated using metaphoric gestures. By contrast, the same gestures can be iconic (drop of the right hand or depicting an arch with the right hand) with the sentences \u201cThe man goes down the hill\u201d or \u201cThere is a bridge over the river\u201d when they illustrate concrete physical features of the world. Thus, concrete utterances are those containing referents that are perceptible to the senses (\u201cThe man ascends to the top of the mountain\u201d). Abstract sentences, on the other hand, contain referents that are not directly perceptible (\u201cThe man ascends to the top of the company\u201d), where the spatial or shape terms in the utterance are being used figuratively. For the distinction between concrete and abstract concepts see Holmes and Rundle ( ). \n\nHere we were interested in the neural processing of the following types of sentences accompanied by gestures: (1) utterances with concrete content and space-related perceptual information (cSP; \u201cdeictic gesture\u201d); (2) utterances with concrete content and shape-related perceptual information (cSH; \u201ciconic gesture\u201d); (3) utterances with an abstract content and space-related perceptual information (aSP; \u201cabstract deictic gestures\u201d); and (4) utterances with an abstract content and shape-related perceptual information (aSH; \u201cmetaphoric gestures\u201d). \n\nAll sentences accompanying gestures had a length of 5\u201310 words, with an average duration of 2.37 s (  SD   = 0.35) and a similar grammatical form (subject\u2014predicate\u2014object). The speech and gestures were performed by the same male actor in a natural, spontaneous way. This procedure was continuously supervised by two of the authors (Benjamin Straube, Tilo Kircher) and timed digitally. All video clips had the same length of 5 s with at least 0.5 s before and after the sentence onset and offset, respectively, where the actor did not speak or move. \n\n\n### Stimulus selection: rating / material selection/matching \n  \nFor stimulus validation, 17 raters not participating in the fMRI study evaluated each video on a scale ranging from 1 to 7 (1 = very low to 7 = very high) according to three content dimensions (space, shape and action information) and familiarity. Other general parameters like \u201cunderstandability\u201d and \u201cnaturalness\u201d were previously validated and controlled for (for detailed information see (Green et al.,  ; Kircher et al.,  ; Straube et al.,  , ). \n\nMaterial was selected to address our manipulations of interest (cf. above):\n   \ncSP =   C  oncrete content and   SP  ace-related information \n  \ncSH =   C  oncrete content and   SH  ape-related information \n  \naSP =   A  bstract content and   SP  ace-related information \n  \naSH =   A  bstract content and   SH  ape-related information \n  \n\nFor each condition 30 sentences were selected to differentiate both factors. Therefore, co-verbal gestures conveying space-related perceptual information (cSP, aSP) were selected to have similar spatial rating scores independent of the level of the abstractness of the utterance (c vs. a). Abstract co-verbal gestures (aSP, aSH) were selected to be similarly abstract independent of the perceptual category of information (space or shape; see Table  ). \n  \n Experimental manipulations  . \n  \n Rating results for the conditions cSP, cSH, aSP, and aSH for space-relatedness, abstractness and shape-relatedness  . \n  \nTo confirm that our stimuli met our design criteria, we calculated analyses of variances for the factors perceptual (space-, shape related) and semantic category (concrete, abstract) as represented in the 2 \u00d7 2 experimental design. \n\nAs intended we found for the rating of spatial information a significant main effect for perceptual category [SP > SH;   F   = 72.532,   p   < 0.001], but no significant effects for the main effect of semantic category [a vs. c;   F   = 0.149,   p   = 0.603] or the interaction of perceptual and semantic category [  F   = 3.250,   p   = 0.074]. \n\nFor the rating of shape information we obtained again a significant main effect for perceptual category [SH > SP;   F   = 98.466,   p   < 0.001], but no significant effects for the main effect of abstractness [a vs. c;   F   = 0.001,   p   = 0.988] or the interaction of perceptual category and abstractness [  F   = 2.053,   p   = 0.155]. \n\nFor the rating of abstractness we obtained a significant main effect for abstractness [a > c;   F   = 116.124,   p   < 0.001], but no significant effects for the main effect of perceptual category [SP vs. SH;   F   = 0.005,   p   = 0.942] or the interaction of perceptual category and abstractness [  F   = 2.975,   p   = 0.087]. For means and confidence intervals see Table  . Together, these analyses confirm that stimulus selection worked out and stimulus characteristics for each condition met our design criteria. \n\nFor the control variables familiarity, naturalness and action information we found no significant main effects or interactions (for all   p   > 0.10). However, we found significant effects for understandability [main effect perceptual category: SP > SH:   F   < 4.960,   p   = 0.028; interaction:   F   < 17.704,   p   < 0.001], speech duration [main effect abstractness: a > c:   F   = 9.024,   p   < 0.003] and gesture duration [main effect abstractness: c > a:   F   < 10.821,   p   < 0.001]. However, differences in understandability were small (<0.22 rating points) and most likely because of ceiling effects in the aSP (skewness = \u22121.68; kurtosis = 4.31) and cSH (skewness = \u22121.40; kurtosis =1.80) conditions. For means and confidence intervals of the control variables see Table  . \n  \n Control variables: understandability, familiarity and naturalness  . \n  \n Rating results for the conditions cSP, cSH, aSP, and aSH for the dimensions understandability, familiarity and naturalness  . \n  \nIn the event-related fMRI study design focusing on the co-occurrence of speech and gesture, differences in speech or gesture duration should not have a crucial impact on our results. However, we included differences in speech and gesture duration for each event as a covariate of no interest in our single-subject design matrix. \n\nApart from the aforementioned factors, further differences in movement characteristics were found between the conditions. For all four conditions predominantly right (cSP = 19; cSH = 13; aSP = 16; aSH = 11) or bimanual movements were performed (cSP = 11; cSH = 17; aSP = 14; aSH = 19). To ensure that none of the patterns of neural activation were produced by differences in hand movements (right hand vs. both hands) and speech length, a separate control analysis was run accounting for the aforementioned dimensions. A set of 11 exactly paired video clips for each condition was used for the additional analysis. \n\nTo account for differences in the size of movements between conditions, we coded each video clip with regard to the extent of the hand movement. We divided the video screen into small rectangles that corresponded to the gesture space described by McNeill ( ); McNeill ( ) and counted the number of rectangles in which gesture movements occurred see Straube et al. ( ). For each video the number of rectangles was also included as covariate of no interest in the single subject model. \n\n\n### Experimental design and procedure \n  \nDuring the fMRI scanning procedure, videos were presented via MR-compatible video goggles (VisuaStim , Resonance Technology, Inc.) and non-magnetic headphones (audio presenting systems for stereophonic stimuli: Commander; Resonance Technology, Inc.), which additionally dampened scanner noise. \n\nThirty items of each of the four conditions were presented in an event-related design, in a pseudo-randomized order and counterbalanced across subjects. Each video was followed by a baseline condition (gray background with a fixation cross) with a variable duration of 3750\u20136750 ms (average: 5000 ms) see Figure  . \n  \n Examples of the different speech and gesture video-clips  . The stimulus material consisted of video clips of an actor performing either space-related   (top)   or shape-related   (bottom)   gestures to corresponding sentences with an concrete   (left)   or abstract content   (right)  . One screen shot of an example video is shown for each condition (cSP, concrete space-related; cSH, concrete shape-related; aSP, abstract space-related; aSH, abstract shape-related). In order to exemplify the stimulus material German sentences are translated into English, and written in speech bubbles for illustration (unlike in the actual stimuli). \n  \nDuring scanning participants were instructed to watch the videos and to indicate via left hand key presses at the beginning of each video whether the spot displayed on the actor's sweater was light or dark colored. This task was chosen to focus participants' attention on the middle of the screen and enabled us to investigate implicit speech and gesture processing without possible instruction-related attention biases. Performance rates and reaction times were recorded. Prior to scanning, each participant received at least 10 practice trials outside the scanner, which were different from the stimuli used in the main experiment. During the preparation scans additional clips were presented to adjust the volume of the headphone. Each participant performed two runs with 60 video clips and a total duration of 10.5 min each. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nMRI was performed on a 3T Siemens scanner (Siemens MRT Trio series). Functional data were acquired with echo planar images in 38 transversal slices (repetition time [TR] = 2000 ms; echo time [TE] = 30 ms; flip angle = 90\u00b0; slice thickness = 3 mm; interslice gap = 0.30 mm; field of view [FoV] = 220 \u00d7 199 mm, voxel resolution = 3.44 \u00d7 3.44 mm, matrix dimensions 64 \u00d7 58 mm). Slices were positioned to achieve whole brain coverage. During each functional run 315 volumes were acquired. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nMR images were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM2;  ) implemented in MATLAB 6.5 (Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA). The first five volumes of every functional run were discarded from the analysis to minimize T1-saturation effects. To correct for different acquisition times, the signal measured in each slice was shifted relative to the acquisition time of the middle slice using a slice interpolation in time. All images of one session were realigned to the first image of a run to correct for head movement and normalized into standard stereotaxic anatomical MNI-space by using the transformation matrix calculated from the first EPI-scan of each subject and the EPI-template. Afterwards, the normalized data with a resliced voxel size of 3.5 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 3.5 mm were smoothed with a 6 mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel to accommodate intersubject variation in brain anatomy. Proportional scaling with high-pass filtering was used to eliminate confounding effects of differences in global activity within and between subjects. \n\nThe expected hemodynamic response at the defined \u201cpoints of integration\u201d for each event-type was modeled by two response functions, a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF; Friston et al.,  ) and its temporal derivative. The temporal derivative was included in the model to account for the residual variance resulting from small temporal differences in the onset of the hemodynamic response, which is not explained by the canonical HRF alone. The functions were convolved with the event sequence, with fixed event duration of 1 s, for the onsets corresponding to the integration points of gesture stroke and sentence keyword to create the stimulus conditions in a general linear model (Green et al.,  ; Kircher et al.,  ; Straube et al.,  ,  ). The fixed event duration of 1 s was chosen to get a broader range of data around the assumed time point of integration. This methodological approach was also applied successfully in previous studies of co-verbal gesture processing (Kircher et al.,  ; Straube et al.,  ,  ). \n\nA group analysis was performed by entering contrast images into a flexible factorial analysis as implemented in SPM5 in which subjects are treated as random variables. A Monte Carlo simulation of the brain volume of the current study was conducted to establish an appropriate voxel contiguity threshold (Slotnick et al.,  ). Assuming an individual voxel type I error of   p   < 0.005, a cluster extent of 8 contiguous re-sampled voxels was necessary to correct for multiple voxel comparisons at   p   < 0.05. Thus, voxels with a significance level of   p   < 0.005 uncorrected, belonging to clusters with at least eight voxels are reported (Straube et al.,  ). Activation peaks of some of the activation clusters also hold a family wise error (FWE) correction. Corresponding corrected   p  -values for each activation peak were included in the tables. The reported voxel coordinates of activation peaks are located in MNI space. Statistical analyses of data other than fMRI were performed using SPSS version 14.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Greenhouse\u2013Geisser correction was applied whenever necessary. \n\n\n### Contrasts of interest \n  \nTo test our hypothesis on the neural processing of different perceptual categories in concrete vs. abstract sentence contexts (cf. Introduction section), baseline contrasts (main effects of condition), conjunction analysis and interaction analysis were run. \n\nAt first, baseline contrasts were calculated in order to detect general activations with regard to the four main conditions (aSP, cSP, aSH, cSH) as compared to baseline (fixation cross). \n\nIn a next step, main effects (SH vs. SP and a vs. c) as well as the interaction were calculated (t-contrasts) to show brain regions involved in the processing of different factors (directed general effects). \n\nTo test the hypothesis that perceptual category is processed in the same neural structures regardless of the language context we performed conjunction analyses of difference contrasts (aSP > aSH \u2229 cSP > cSH and aSH > aSP \u2229 cSH > cSP). To test for general effects of abstractness independent of both space-related as well as shape-related contents the same approach was used (aSP > cSP \u2229 aSH > cSH and cSH > aSH \u2229 cSP > aSP). \n\nFinally, we performed two interaction analyses to test the hypothesis that abstractness significantly changes the processing of perceptual categories, space and shape: (1) = (aSP > cSP) > (aSH > cSH) masked for (aSP > cSP) and aSP; (2) = (aSH > cSH) > (aSP > cSP) masked for (aSH > cSH) and aSH. The masking procedure was applied to avoid the interpretation of deactivation in the concrete conditions and restrict the effects to increased activity for aSP vs. low-level baseline and its concrete derivative (cSP). Based on our hypothesis, this methodological approach enables us to find specific neural responses for semantic category (concrete/abstract) in space-related (1) and shape-related (2) perceptual contexts. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nThe average reaction time for the control task (\u201cindicate the color of the spot on the actor's sweater\u201d) did not differ with regard to color or gesture condition [color:   F   = 0.506,   P   = 0.488; condition:   F   = 0.604,   P   = 0.604; interaction:   F   = 1.256,   P   = 0.301; within-subjects two-factorial ANOVA; mean = 1.23 sec,   SD   = 0.94]. The participants showed an average accuracy rate of 99% which did not differ across conditions [  F   = 0.273,   P   = 0.841, within-subjects ANOVA]. Thus, the attention control task indicated that participants did pay attention to the video clips. \n\n\n### fMRI results \n  \n#### Baseline contrasts (aSP, cSP, aSH, cSH) \n  \nTo explore the general processing mechanisms for each condition and the high comparability between conditions baseline contrasts were calculated (Figure  , Table  ). We found comparable activation patterns as in previous studies on speech and gesture stimuli (Straube et al.,  ). \n  \n Activation pattern in contrast to baseline (whole-brain,   p   < 0.005, cluster extend threshold = 8 voxels; MC corrected   p   < 0.05)  . \n    \n Gesture conditions in contrast to low level baseline (fixation cross)  . \n  \n Significance level (t-value), size of the respective activation cluster (No. voxels; number of voxels > 8) at p < 0.005 MC corrected for multiple comparisons. Coordinates are listed in MNI space. BA is the Brodmann area nearest to the coordinate and should be considered approximate. (cSP, concrete spatial; cSH, concrete descriptive; AS, abstract spatial; aSH, abstract descriptive)  . \n  \n\n#### Main effects for perceptual category \n  \nTo identify the general effect of speech-gesture information, the main effect for the factors perception category [space-related (SP) vs. shape-related (SH)] were calculated. \n\nFor the effect of space-related vs. shape-related information (SP > SH) we found an extended network of activations including left middle [Brodmann Area (BA) 6] and superior frontal (BAs 6/8) as well as temporo-parietal (BAs 21/39/40) brain regions (Table  ). \n  \n Main effects for space-related and shape-related semantic contents  . \n  \n Significance level (  t  -value), size of the respective activation cluster (No. voxels; number of voxels > 8) at   p   < 0.005 MC corrected for multiple comparisons. Coordinates are listed in MNI space. BA is the Brodmann area nearest to the coordinate and should be considered approximate  . \n  \nThe processing of shape-related vs. space-related information (SH > SP) resulted in enhanced neural responses in bilateral occipital-parietal (BAs 18/37) and middle (BA 11) as well as inferior frontal (BA 45) gyri and left parietal (BA 40) brain region (Table  ). \n\n\n#### Main effects for abstractness \n  \nAbstract vs. concrete speech-gesture information (a > c) revealed a widespread pattern of activation. A large cluster of activation was found in the left IFG extending to the temporal lobe, including the temporal pole and the middle temporal gyrus. Activations were also found in the right superior temporal gyrus, in the left precuneus and right cuneus as well as in the left precentral and superior medial gyri (BAs 6/9). Enhanced neural responses were also found in the middle cingulate, the left superior frontal and superior medial cortex as well as in the left angular gyrus (BA 39/40) (see Table  , Figure  ). \n  \n Main effect for abstractness and concreteness  . \n    \n Significant brain activations for abstractness, concreteness as well as for shape-related co-verbal gesture processing (whole-brain,   p   < 0.005, cluster extend threshold = 8 voxels; MC corrected   p   < 0.05) (cSP, concrete spatial; cSH, concrete shape; AS, abstract spatial; aSH, abstract shape)  . \n  \nFor the reverse contrast (c > a) we found activations in the left and right parahippocampal and fusiform gyri (BA 36/37), in the left inferior frontal (BA 46) and in the temporo-occipital region (BA 37) as well as in the left superior occipital gyrus (BA 19) (see Table  ). Smaller clusters of activation were found in the right cerebellum, the middle frontal (BA 11) and in the precentral gyrus (BA 4). \n\n\n#### Interaction of perceptual categories and abstractness \n  \nFor the interaction of perceptual category and abstractness (aSP > cSP)>(aSH > cSH) we found superior medial frontal, left inferior frontal (BA45/44) and middle temporal and superior parietal brain regions (see Table  ). \n  \n Interaction of semantic categories and abstractness  . \n  \nFor the contrast in the opposite direction (aSH > cSH) > (aSP > cSP) we found a more distributed predominantly right hemispheric activation pattern including the occipital lobe, the middle frontal gyrus, the inferior parietal lobe, the precuneus, the IFG (BA44/45), the middle occipital gyrus and the bilateral fusiform gyri (see Table  ). \n\n\n#### Specific contrasts of interest \n  \n  Brain areas sensitive for shape-related and space-related perceptual contents independent of abstractness   . A conjunction analysis for shape-related form descriptive perceptual contents irrespective of the level of abstractness (aSH > aSP \u2229 cSH > cSP) revealed enhanced neural responses in the left middle occipital gyrus (BA 37; see supplementary material Table  ). \n\nNo region was found to be significantly activated for space vs. shape-related processing on concrete and abstract level (aSP > aSH \u2229 cSP > cSH) (see supplementary material Table  ). \n\n  Brain areas sensitive for abstractness independent of perceptual category (shape/space)   . Common activations for abstract as opposed to concrete co-verbal gestures, irrespective of descriptive or spatial information (aSH > cSH \u2229 aSP > cSP), resulted in a large cluster of activation encompassing the left temporal pole and the middle temporal gyrus. Another cluster of activation was found in the right superior temporal gyrus and in the left IFG, including the pars Orbitalis as well as the pars Triangularis (BA 44; see supplementary material Table  ). \n\nThe imaging results for concreteness independent of the shape-related or space-related perceptual content (cSH > aSH \u2229 cSP > aSP) revealed enhanced BOLD responses in the left parahippocampal gyrus (BA 35; see supplementary material Table  ). \n\n  Specific neural responses for abstractness in space-related (1) as well as in shape-related (2) content domains   . The specifically masked interaction analyses (see Contrast of Interest section) revealed distinct activation for abstractness on space-related information [(sSP > cSP) > (aSH > cSH) masked for (aSP > cSP) and aSP] within the left IFG (MNIxyz: \u221253, 28, 0;   t   = 4.77; 42 voxels) and the left pTL (MNIxyz: \u221260, \u221246, 4;   t   = 3.07; 10 voxels; see Figure  ). The other direction of contrasts did not reveal any significant results. \n  \n Interaction of space-related co-verbal information processing and abstractness (whole-brain,   p   < 0.005, cluster extend threshold = 8 voxels; MC corrected   p   < 0.05) (cSP, concrete spatial; cSH, concrete shape; AS, abstract spatial; aSH, abstract shape)  . \n  \nTaken together, significant main effects and interactions of brain activation with regard to the manipulated factors [type of communicated perceptual information (SP, SH) and abstractness (c, a)] revealed different patterns of activation. The specific contrasts indicated that subregions of the left IFG and the left pTL have common [conjunction analyses: IFG [MNIxyz: \u221239, 28, \u22124;   t   = 3.27; 11 voxels], pTL (MNIxyz: \u221253, \u221238, 0;   t   = 4.26; 196)] and distinct functions [interaction: IFG (MNIxyz: \u221253, 28, 0;   t   = 4.77; 42 voxels], pTL [MNIxyz: \u221260, \u221246, 4;   t   = 3.07; 10 voxels)] with regard to perceptual type and abstractness. \n\nThe same analysis, including only right-handed gesture stimuli of equal length (speech duration) revealed the same pattern of activation encompassing the left IFG as well as the left middle temporal gyrus, indicating that this effect is not based on irrelevant differences in stimulus material. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nSpace and shape are distinct perceptual categories. Words referring to space and shape also describe abstract concepts like \u201crising income\u201d (space) or a \u201csquare personality\u201d (shape). Gestures are an important part of human communication that underpin verbal utterances and can convey shape or space information even when accompanying abstract sentences. Recent studies have investigated the neural processing of speech and gesture (Willems and Hagoort,  ; Willems et al.,  ,  ; Dick et al.,  ,  ; Green et al.,  ; Hubbard et al.,  ; Kelly et al.,  ; Kircher et al.,  ; Skipper et al.,  ; Straube et al.,  ; Holle et al.,  ). Despite the fact that the investigation of perceptual categories used in speech and gesture could give important answers with regard to the effect of abstractness on particular neural networks relevant for the processing of such perceptual information, the related effect is not known. Thus, the purpose of the current fMRI study was to investigate the neural processing of shape-related vs. space-related co-speech gesture information when presented with abstract or concrete utterances aiming at the question whether similar or distinct neural networks are involved. \n\nIn line with previous findings (Straube et al.,  ) we found enhanced cortical activations for abstract (a) as opposed to concrete (c) utterances in the bilateral temporal lobes and in the left IFG for both, space as well as shape-related sentences (aSP > cSP and aSH > cSH). The interaction of perceptual category and abstractness in a more anterior part of the left IFG and inferior part of the pTL indicates that abstractness strongly influenced the neural processing of space and shape information. Only the effect of shape- vs. space-related information revealed activation in a single cluster of the left inferior occipital gyrus independent of abstractness (cSH > cSP \u2229 aSH c> aSP). By contrast, the interaction resulted in enhanced BOLD responses in a more anterior part of the left IFG and inferior part of the pTL. Thus, we demonstrate the interaction of perceptual category and abstractness on the neural processing of speech accompanied by gestures. These data suggest a functional division of the pTL and left IFG being sensitive to the processing of both the level of abstractness and the type of categorical information. These imaging results further offer neural support for the traditional categorization of co-verbal gestures with regard to their content and abstractness (McNeill,  ,  ). \n\nThe imaging results for the abstract co-verbal gesture condition revealed BOLD enhancements in the left inferior frontal and the bilateral temporal regions, respectively. This finding is consistent with previous evidence of involvement of the left IFG and bilateral temporal lobes in the integration of gestures with abstract sentences (Kircher et al.,  ; Straube et al.,  ,  ). With regard to the underlying neuro-cognitive processes, we assume that the concrete visual gesture information (e.g., illustrating an arch of a bridge) is being interpreted in context of the abstract sentence meaning (\u201cthe politician builds a bridge to the next topic\u201d). Thus, correspondence of gesture and sentence meaning must be identified and figurative components of speech and gesture must be translated from their literal/concrete meanings. To build this relation between speech and gesture information on the level of abstractness, additional online unification processes within the IFG seem to be relevant (Straube et al.,  ). Such processes might be similar to those responsible for making inferences (e.g., Bunge et al.,  , relational reasoning (e.g., Wendelken et al.,  ), the building of analogies (e.g., Luo et al.,  ; Bunge et al.,  ; Green et al.,  ; Watson and Chatterjee,  ), and unification (Hagoort et al.,  ; Straube et al.,  ). Those processes may also be involved in the comprehension of novel metaphoric or ambiguous communications and consistently activate the left IFG (Rapp et al.,  ,  ; Stringaris et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ; Cardillo et al.,  ). Consequently, enhanced neural responses in the fronto-temporal network may be evoked by the higher cognitive demand in an abstract metaphoric context which may have resulted in the recruitment of the left inferior frontal and middle temporal region (Kircher et al.,  ; Straube et al.,  ). \n\nConcrete speech accompanied by gestures revealed a pattern of enhanced BOLD responses in parahippocampal regions bilaterally as well as in the left superior occipital gyrus. Concrete co-verbal utterances such as, \u201cthe workman builds a bridge over the river,\u201d evokes a comparatively transparent connection/relation to a familiar everyday event. Accordingly, an experienced-based understanding of a scene may have resulted in the recruitment of the parahippocampal regions, whereas the direct imagery of concrete objects or actions may have resulted in enhanced neural responses in the left superior occipital region (Green et al.,  ) facilitating the understanding of the concrete co-verbal content. \n\nThe shape-related sentences accompanied by shape-related gestures revealed activations in the left middle occipital region. Similar to the activations found for the concrete condition (c > a), imagery of an experience-based perceptual representation resulted in the activations of the left occipital area. However, we did not observe common activation for the processing of spatial information in a concrete and abstract sentence context. Together these data do not support a universal neural processing of space and shape in a multimodal communication context. \n\nBy contrast, we found an interaction for perceptual category and abstractness, as spatial information on an abstract level (aSP) specifically (in contrast to all other conditions) activated a particular part of the left IFG and the left superior temporal region. This finding was robust and independent of both hand movement and speech duration. Thus, BOLD enhancements in these regions suggest that predominantly spatial information is processed differently in an abstract vs. concrete sentence context. Additional semantic information is retrieved from the left superior temporal region. The higher cognitive load together with the resulting enhanced effort with regard to information-specific abstract and spatial lexical retrieval may account for the recruitment of the fronto-temporal network. However, specific activation of the left IFG could also represent competition between meanings of spatial terms in the aSP condition, including at a minimum the concrete/literal and the abstract/metaphoric interpretations (Chatterjee,  ; Chen et al.,  ). \n\nFor the processing of shape-related information we found common activation within the inferior temporal gyrus and the occipital lobe for concrete and abstract utterances, suggesting a common perceptual representation activated during comprehension of shape information. This perceptual representation probably compensated for the need of additional resources of the IFG and pTL, which were activated for space-related information in an abstract sentence context. Thus, this finding suggests that a concrete representation of shape is also activated in an abstract sentence context. This might have further facilitated the processing of the abstract representation of shape. For the processing of space-related information we found no common activation for concrete and abstract utterances, indicating different neural processing mechanism for both types of communications. The transformation of space-related gesture information in an abstract sentence context probably required higher order semantic processing mechanisms (Straube et al.,  ) which probably inhibited the actual perceptual spatial representation of these gestures. \n\nA limitation of this study is that the specific effects of gesture as well as integration processes cannot be disentangled. Distinguishing between speech and gesture was not the purpose of the current study. The problem with regard to the interpretation of our results for the main effect of abstractness, irrespective of perceptual category, might be that the activation patterns found for abstract speech accompanied by gestures in the left IFG and bilateral temporal lobes is produced by differences in the abstractness between the sentences, as demonstrated by several studies about metaphoric speech processing (Rapp et al.,  ,  ; Eviatar and Just,  ; Mashal et al.,  ,  ; Nagels et al.,  ; Stringaris et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ). However, in a previous study we observed increased activation in the left IFG for metaphoric co-verbal gestures in contrast to control sentences with the identical abstract semantic content (Kircher et al.,  ). Furthermore, there is evidence that activation of the left IFG is specifically related to the processing of novel and therefore unconventional metaphoric sentences (Rapp et al.,  ,  ; Cardillo et al.,  ), in which abstract information must be interpreted online in terms of its non-literal meaning. However, the abstract sentences used in the current study were conventional and part of everyday communication, e.g., \u201cThe talk was on a high level.\u201d This is supported by our rating results, which revealed no differences between the conditions with regard to familiarity. Despite the fact, that we cannot exclude that differences between conditions might be explained by differences in difficulty due to our language manipulation (concrete vs. abstract), the lack of commonalities (e.g., Spa > SHa \u2229 SPc > SHc) cannot be explained by these potential differences. The robustness of the imaging results in the aforementioned regions is further supported by the separate control analyses encompassing a carefully matched subset of paired (hand movements and speech length) stimuli. \n\nA further limitation is that the distinction between space- and shape-related information in the current experiment is artificial and do not represent independent factors. Shape gestures include some spatial information. However, despite this intrinsic connection between space and shape, our data demonstrate that these perceptual categories can be distinguished by independent raters and produce distinct interacting activation patterns with regard to abstractness. Therefore, our data support the validity of this separation, which has been traditionally applied in terms of deictic or abstract deictic gestures (which refer to space) in contrast to iconic and metaphoric gestures (which rather refer to form or shape; e.g., McNeill,  ). \n\nWith this study we demonstrate the interaction of perceptual category and abstractness in the neural processing of speech-gesture utterances. Besides abstractness, the type of information was relevant to the neural processing of speech accompanied by gestures. This finding illustrates the relevance of the interaction between language and cognition, which characterizes the complexity of natural interpersonal communication. Future studies should therefore consider the importance of perceptual type and abstractness for the interpretation of their imaging results. Our data suggest a functional subdivision of the pTL and left IFG with regard to the processing of space and shape-related information in an abstract sentence context. Such differences support the theoretically based traditional categorization of co-verbal gestures with regard to information type and abstractness (McNeill,  ). Most likely the investigation of other types of co-verbal gestures will demonstrate further important differences in the processing of specific co-verbal gesture types, which will enlighten the fine-grained differences of processing mechanisms, which underlie the comprehension of multimodal natural communication. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the

It is estimated that up to 40%\u201050% of mTBI patients have cognitive impairment symptoms 3\u00a0months after injury, and 10%\u201025% still have symptoms after 1\u00a0year.  Nevertheless, most mTBI patients with cognitive impairment tend to be clinically neglected, given their negative conventional neuroimaging manifestations on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Therefore, patients with cognitive impairment may be underestimated, resulting in a substantial impact on their life and social interactions. Posttraumatic cognitive impairment might be associated with changes in brain function, which can be observed using resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs\u2010fMRI) that may reveal disorders of large neural networks involved in cognitive function and their relationship with cognitive impairment among mTBI populations.  However, heterogeneity in neuroimaging studies has led to diversity in the systematic understanding of the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and brain states in mTBI patients. \n\nPrevious studies have confirmed that changes in functional connectivity (FC) were associated with posttraumatic cognitive impairment in mTBI patients, ,   which mainly focused on the default mode network (DMN), ,   executive control network (ECN),  motor network,  and interhemispheric network connectivity,  suggesting that neuroimaging has potential significance for understanding the neuropathological mechanisms of cognitive impairment after mTBI. Nevertheless, other functional networks related to widespread neurocognitive impairments exist in patients with mTBI, such as the salience, visual, and attention networks, have been less explored. \n\nThere has been a growing consensus that posttraumatic cognitive abnormalities reflect atypical interactions between multiple systems in the brain rather than problems affecting isolated brain regions.  Using rs\u2010fMRI to study interactions between specific brain regions, FC studies have shown that mTBI was associated with abnormal connections in corticocortical networks that support social cognitive functions such as executive function, working memory, and visual attention.  Considering the topological properties of whole\u2010brain networks, graph theory studies have consistently reported changes in local and global information transmission efficiency in patients with mTBI.  In addition, Li et al  used Granger causality to analyze the topological properties of functional brain networks in mTBI patients based on source connectivity analysis of resting\u2010state magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity and identified that the brain regions in which the ingoing and outgoing connections were significantly different across the two groups in different frequency bands. Although these studies help to describe the disconnection model of mTBI, the inter\u2010network interactions in patients with mTBI have not been comprehensively assessed. \n\nTo date, only a few studies have explored inter\u2010network interactions in mTBI patients, reporting significantly increased connectivity between the CN and SMN  and decreased connectivity between the DMN and basal ganglia network in patients with mTBI.  While these studies have provided initial evidence regarding abnormalities in inter\u2010network interactions in mTBI, they focused on a limited number of a priori selected networks and did not analyze the interactions between each network. To define different remote interaction patterns, independent component analysis (ICA) has been widely used for identifying resting\u2010state networks (RSNs) in view of its ability to isolate various brain function networks. ,   Meanwhile, the function network connectivity (FNC) can be used to represent the temporal correlation between these RSNs. ,   Therefore, exploration of the RSNs and FNC may provide more information to advance the understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of cognitive impairment in mTBI. \n\nGiven the basis of prior work and theoretical considerations, we aimed to systematically explore the alterations in RSNs and the interactions between RSNs in acute mTBI. The temporal correlation of brain networks' activity was used to quantify their interactions and to estimate the extent to which group differences could predict the characteristics of posttraumatic cognitive impairment. We hypothesized that distinct FC patterns may exist in acute mTBI patients, and these group differences in RSNs and network interactions would be associated with cognitive impairment. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Subjects and clinical data \n  \nA total of 53 patients with mTBI (25 males and 28 females; age range: 20\u201058\u00a0years) were recruited from the emergency department of our hospital between January 2018 and May 2019. The inclusion criteria for patients with mTBI were as follows: (aa) age 20\u00a0years or older (right\u2010handed); (b) the presence of trauma to the head; (c) an initial Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 13\u201015 in the emergency department; (d) initial emergency room evaluation of mTBI (loss of consciousness <30\u00a0minutes, posttraumatic amnesia <24\u00a0hours, or recorded alteration in mental status [ie, dazed, confused, or disoriented]); and (e) CT scan as a part of their clinical evaluation. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) a history of a previous brain injury, neuropsychological or neurological disorder, psychoactive medication use, or concurrent substance abuse; (b) history of alcohol or drug abuse; (c) history of sedative use in hospitals or emergency rooms; and (d) MRI contraindications. Additionally, 43 healthy subjects (all right\u2010handed; 19 males and 24 females; age range: 20\u201059\u00a0years) matched for age, sex, and education level were recruited as the healthy control (HC) group. The HC group was subject to the same exclusion criteria as the patient group. All HCs underwent the same neuroimaging tests as mTBI patients. \n\n\n### Cognitive function assessment \n  \nThe Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was chosen to evaluate the neurocognitive state of all participants, which evaluated several aspects of cognitive function, including visuospatial/execution, naming, language, attention, abstraction, memory (short\u2010term immediate and deferred recall), and localization.  The assessment time was approximately 10\u00a0minutes, with a maximum score of 30. Those subjects with scores of 26 or more were considered cognitively normal, and lower scores indicated poorer cognitive abilities. \n\n\n### MRI acquisition \n  \nAll MRI data were acquired within 7\u00a0days postinjury on a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner (Ingenia, Philips Medical Systems) using an 8\u2010channel digital head coil receiver and parallel imaging technology. For this analysis, the functional images were acquired axially using a gradient echo\u2010planar imaging sequence. The scanning parameters were as follows: echo time (TE)\u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0ms; repetition time (TR)\u00a0=\u00a02000\u00a0ms; slices\u00a0=\u00a036; gap\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0mm; thickness\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0mm; field of view (FOV)\u00a0=\u00a0240\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240\u00a0mm; flip angle (FA)\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0; and acquisition matrix\u00a0=\u00a064\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064. The rs\u2010fMRI sequence scan took 8\u00a0minutes and 6\u00a0seconds. Structural images were acquired with a three\u2010dimensional turbo fast echo (3D\u2010TFE) T1WI sequence with high resolution, and the scanning parameters were as follows: TR/TE\u00a0=\u00a08.1/3.7\u00a0ms; slices\u00a0=\u00a0170; thickness\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mm; gap\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0mm; acquisition matrix\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256; FA\u00a0=\u00a08\u00b0; and FOV\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256\u00a0mm. The structural sequence took 5\u00a0minutes and 28\u00a0seconds to complete. During all resting\u2010state scans, scanner noise and head motion were reduced using earplugs and foam padding, and the participants were instructed to close their eyes and rest peacefully. In addition, 3D gradient echo susceptibility\u2010weighted imaging sequences (TR/TE\u00a0=\u00a022/34\u00a0ms; FA\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0; matrix\u00a0=\u00a0276\u00d7319; slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mm; and FOV\u00a0=\u00a0220\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0220\u00a0mm) were also implemented to help detect hemorrhagic or other lesions. \n\n\n### Data preprocessing \n  \nData Processing & Analysis for Resting\u2010State Brain Imaging (DPABI_V4.3_200301) with the following stages was applied for data analysis.  First, the first 10 volumes were removed from each time series to allow for participant adaptation to the scanning environment. The remaining images were then slice\u2010timing corrected and calibrated for head motion correction. Participant data demonstrating head movement >2.0\u00a0mm translation or >2.0\u00b0 rotation were excluded from the analysis. The rest of the dataset was spatially normalized to a template from the Montreal Neurological Institute (resampled voxel size\u00a0=\u00a03\u00d73\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm ), followed by a 6\u2010mm spatial sequence with a Gaussian smoothing kernel. Finally, several sources of spurious variances were removed by linear regression, which included six head motion parameters, and average signals from white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and whole brain. \n\n\n### Independent component analysis \n  \nThe group ICA software of fMRI toolbox software ( ) was used to select RSNs. The ICA analysis was carried out in three stages: (a) data reduction, (b) application of the ICA algorithm, and (c) back reconstruction for each individual subject. The number of independent components (ICs) was determined by using the minimum description length (MDL) criteria.  The data reduction was followed by a set of spatial ICA, which was executed on the aggregate data of the participants, resulting in an estimate of the ICs.  Then, the strength value of connectivity within each independent component was converted into a z\u2010score to reflect the degree of correlation between the time series of a given voxel and the average time series of its corresponding components. In addition, to verify the choice of separated ICs, we implemented the ICA (model sequence) with different independent component numbers and performed the following analysis (ie, within\u2010RSN analysis and FNC analysis) seven times. \n\n\n### Within\u2010RSN analysis \n  \nAmong the 34 components resulting from ICA, we selected 13 components (7 nonartifactual RSNs) as the focus of the subsequent analyses (Figure\u00a0 ) through visual inspection in accordance with previous rs\u2010fMRI studies. ,   For each RSN, the single\u2010sample   t   test was first used to obtain the z\u2010maps for each group, the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct, and the statistical figure was obtained at the threshold of   P  \u00a0<\u00a0.01. Then, the group comparison of the z\u2010maps of the RSNs was conducted using a two\u2010sample   t   test restricted to the voxels within a union mask and was determined by the   t   test results of two single samples. Between\u2010group effects were thresholded at   P  \u00a0<\u00a0.01, corrected by FDR correction. Regions with significant differences in the two\u2010sample t test were chosen from each RSN and used in the subsequent analysis. \n  \nFunctional relevant RSNs. The spatial maps of 13 independent components (ICs) were selected as the RSNs for further analysis. AN, attention network; CN, cerebellum network; DMN, default mode network; ECN, executive control network; SMN, sensorimotor network; SN, salience network; VN, visual network \n  \n\n### Static FNC analysis between RSNs \n  \nAfter the ICA, the individual\u2010level time courses of recognized RSNs were deduced by using the spatiotemporal double regression method. To study the relationship between time courses of different RSNs, the static FNC analysis was carried out. First, a time\u2010domain band\u2010pass filter (band\u2010pass 0.00\u20100.25\u00a0Hz) was used to reduce the influence of low\u2010frequency drift and high\u2010frequency physiological noise on the time process. The correlations between any two RSN time processes for each participant were then calculated. We calculated FNC using the Pearson correlation coefficient between each and every other summary time course, which resulted in an FNC matrix with the dimensions of 13 times 13 (RSNs) times 93 (participants). In the general linear model, FNC group difference estimation was performed for each pair of RSNs. The significance threshold was   P  \u00a0<\u00a0.01, corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR. Then, we focused on RSN pairs with significant differences between the adjusted FNC groups to study their relationship with cognitive performance. \n\n\n### Correlation analysis \n  \nThe correlations were calculated between FC in the RSNs/FNC and the cognitive function assessments in mTBI. For each RSN, the brain region with a significant difference in the two\u2010sample t test was selected as the region of interest (ROI) to extract the coordinates of the ROIs. The relevant calculation was then performed using the mean z\u2010scores within the ROI. In addition, the FNC coefficients that showed a highly significant difference between two groups were also used in the correlations with the MoCA scores. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristic were assessed between mTBI patients and HCs using an independent t test for continuous variables and a chi\u2010square test for proportions by the SPSS 19.0 software package (SPSS, Inc). Statistical significance was set as   P  \u00a0<\u00a0.05. Shapiro\u2010Wilk tests were used to evaluate data normality, and   P   values >.05 indicate a normal distribution of data. Then, we used Cohen's d to describe the effect size (ES) of each clinical variable. For RSN and FNC analysis, group comparisons between the mTBI and HC groups were performed using two\u2010sample t tests. The significance threshold was set at   P  \u00a0<\u00a0.01 using FDR corrections. Age, sex, and education level were used as covariates. In addition, Pearson's correlation coefficients between functional connection strength and cognitive scores were analyzed with a significance level of   P  \u00a0<\u00a0.05. SPM12 was used for voxel\u2010level statistical analysis of the RSNs, and MATLAB (MATLAB 2013a) was used for other statistical analyses, including FNC group comparisons and correlation analyses. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Participants and clinical data \n  \nAfter the fMRI data head motion check, three patients were excluded because of excessive head motion artifacts, so the final cohort in this study consisted of 50 mTBI patients and 43 HC subjects. MRI scans were obtained in the mTBI patients at an average of 3.12\u00a0days (range, 0\u20107\u00a0days) after head injury. Compared with the HCs, mTBI patients in the acute stage showed lower MoCA scores (  P  \u00a0=\u00a0.000), indicating more severe cognitive disability in the mTBI group. Among all subcategories of the MoCA test, only the visuospatial/executive (  P  \u00a0=\u00a0.004), language (  P  \u00a0=\u00a0.010), and attention (  P  \u00a0=\u00a0.005) subcategories were significantly lower in the mTBI group than those in the HC group. The scores for memory, abstraction, naming, and orientation did not differ between the mTBI and HC groups (  P  \u00a0>\u00a0.05). The demographic and neuropsychological data from this study are shown in Table\u00a0 . \n  \nDemographic characteristics and cognitive performance in patients with mTBI and healthy controls \n   Note    \n\n### ICA and component selection \n  \nIn this study, a total of 34 ICs were extracted by ICA, among which 13 components were selected as the RSNs for further analysis in accordance with previously published results (Figure\u00a0 ). Subsequently, seven networks with these components were labeled as follows: the salience network (SN) (IC10) showed spatial patterns mainly consisting of the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and anterior insular cortices, as well as part of the prefrontal areas. The executive control network (ECN) (IC2\u00a0+\u00a021) included the left lateral frontoparietal network (LFPN) and the right lateral frontoparietal network (RFPN). The LFPN was mainly focused at the left middle frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, superior parietal lobule, and angular gyrus; the RFPN mainly showed similar spatial patterns with the LFPN. The default mode network (DMN) (IC18\u00a0+\u00a019+25) typically included the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, inferior parietal, bilateral angular gyrus, and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) nodes. The attention network (AN) (IC12) mainly included the bilateral intraparietal sulcus, frontal eye field, and middle temporal lobe. The visual network (VN) (IC9\u00a0+\u00a015) included the primary visual cortex (the bilateral calcarine sulcus and medial extra\u2010striate regions [eg, the lingual gyrus and cuneus]) and extravisual (the occipital pole, the lateral occipital cortex, and the occipital part of the fusiform gyrus). The sensorimotor network (SMN) (IC3\u00a0+\u00a07) comprised SMN1 that included the supplementary motor area, the paracentral lobule, and the pre\u2010 and postcentral gyri; SMN2 was mainly focused at the bilateral primary somatosensory cortex, including precentral and postcentral gyri areas. The cerebellum network (CN) (IC4\u00a0+\u00a034) had spatial patterns that primarily encompassed the cerebellum anterior lobe, cerebellum posterior lobe, and declive. \n\n\n### Group FC differences within RSNs \n  \nSignificant differences between the mTBI and HC groups were found within five RSNs, including the SN, DMN, ECN, VN, and CN (Table\u00a0 , Figure\u00a0 ). Compared with the HC group, the mTBI group exhibited decreased FC within the SN (right insula [R_ insula]), ECN (left superior parietal lobe [L_SPL] and left superior frontal gyrus [L_SFG]), VN (right precuneus [R_precuneus]), and CN (right cerebellum anterior lobe [R_CAL]). Moreover, there was increased FC in the right middle frontal gyrus (R_MFG) in the DMN in the mTBI group compared with the HC group. Based on voxel\u2010wise analysis, the acute stage mTBI group compared with the HC group did not demonstrate altered resting\u2010state FC in the SMN and attention network. \n  \nBrain regions with significant differences connectivity within RSNs between acute mTBI patients and healthy controls \n      \nGroup FC differences within RSNs. Significant differences between the mTBI and HC groups were found within five RSNs. CAL, cerebellum anterior lobe; CN, cerebellum network; DMN, default mode network; ECN, executive control network; L, left; MFG, middle frontal gyrus; R, right; SFG, superior frontal gyrus; SN, salience network; SPL, superior parietal lobe; VN, visual network \n  \n\n### Group differences in static FNC \n  \nFor the FNC analysis, five connections were found to be significantly altered. Relative to the HC group, the mTBI group exhibited significantly decreased negative interactions in three RSN connections, including the SN\u2010CN connection, VN\u2010SMN connection, and ECN\u2010DMN connection. Moreover, compared with the HC group, the mTBI group showed increased FNC in the interaction between the VN cortices (IC15) and AN cortices (IC12), as well as the VN cortices (IC15) and DMN cortices (IC25). In addition, DMN (IC18)\u2010DMN (IC19), that is, FC within an RSN, was also found to be significantly decreased in the mTBI group compared with the HC group (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nGroup differences in static FNC. (A) FNC correlations matrix (averaged over subjects); (B) FNC correlations domain matrix (averaged over subjects); (C) significant effects of group between patients and controls; (D)five connections were found to be significantly altered (  P  \u00a0<\u00a0.05); and DMN\u2010ECN connection was found to be positively correlated with attention scores (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0.405,   P  \u00a0=\u00a0.003) (E) and language scores (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0.329,   P  \u00a0=\u00a0.019) (F) \n  \n\n\n## CORRELATION ANALYSIS \n  \nCorrelations were performed between the mean z\u2010scores of six ROIs in the five RSNs and cognitive assessment scores, and significant positive correlations were found between the right insula region within the SN and attention scores (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0.407,   P  \u00a0=\u00a0.003), as well as the right precuneus within VN and visuospatial/executive scores (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0.334,   P  \u00a0=\u00a0.017). In addition, a significant negative correlation was found between the right MFG within the DMN and language scores (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.399,   P  \u00a0=\u00a0.004) (Figure\u00a0 ). Moreover, after performing the correlations between the FNC coefficients (five connections) and the cognitive assessment scores in the mTBI group, only the DMN\u2010ECN connection was found to be positively correlated with attention scores (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0.405,   P  \u00a0=\u00a0.003) and language scores (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0.329,   P  \u00a0=\u00a0.019) (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nCorrelations between the mean z\u2010scores of six ROIs in the five RSNs and cognitive assessment scores in mTBI patients at the acute stage. (A) Significant positive correlations were found between the right insula region within the SN and attention scores (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0.407,   P  \u00a0=\u00a0.003); (B) significant positive correlations were found between the right precuneus within VN and visuospatial/executive scores (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0.334,   P  \u00a0=\u00a0.017); and (C) significant negative correlation was found between the right MFG within the DMN and language scores (  r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.399,   P  \u00a0=\u00a0.004) \n  \n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn this study, decreased FC was observed within several motor\u2010 and cognitive\u2010related networks in acute mTBI, that is, the SN, ECN, VN, and CN. It is worth pointing out that the change in the SN in acute mTBI was an important finding that had not been previously reported in acute mTBI. The SN is a large\u2010scale edge network that coactivates signals needed for behavioral changes.  As part of the SN, the insular cortex plays an important role in integrating external and internal processes, emotional processing, and controlling cognitive functions and behavior.  Our group recently demonstrated FC dysfunction in the insula of mTBI patients. ,   In addition, the frontoparietal lobe is an important network of spatial attention, and the ECN is considered to have a good correspondence with the cognitive language paradigm.  Consistent with this notion, mTBI patients showed decreased FC in the right insula within the SN as well as the left SPL and the left SFG within the ECN, suggesting that dysfunction within the SN and ECN might contribute to the cognitive impairments observed in acute mTBI patients. \n\nIn general, the VN is associated with the processing of visual information, and visual dysfunction in mTBI patients has been associated with high levels of processing deficits.  Moreover, the positive correlation between the VN and visuospatial/executive scores also suggested that decreased FC in the VN aggravated the cognitive dysfunction in acute mTBI. In addition, an understanding of the cerebellum's role in motor learning and cognitive processes has been emerging, and cerebellar damage might lead to postural and movement impairments.  Previous studies have demonstrated that mTBI patients in the acute stage had abnormal fractional anisotropy in specific regions of the cerebellum, and altered cerebellar fractional anisotropy was associated with cognitive impairment.  Within the CN, acute mTBI patients showed decreased connectivity in the right CAL in this study. This finding was not consistent with the study of Wang et al, suggesting that acute mTBI patients showed increased FC in the CN. \n\nA fMRI study demonstrated hyperconnectivity within DMN connectivity in mTBI patients,  which was mainly located in portions of the posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex, representing brain neuroplasticity operative in neural repair and recovery after injury. In line with these reports, we found that the left MFG appeared hyperconnected within the DMN in the mTBI patients in the acute stage, and this result could be interpreted as a compensatory reallocation or recruitment of cognitive resources. Meanwhile, our previous study used GCA to analyze the causal connections in the acute mTBI patients and demonstrated significantly increased connectivity from the left ACC to the left MFG.  For mTBI patients, Benier et al and Sharp et al hypothesized that such hyperconnectivity patterns in the DMN could be related to dysfunction in working memory and attention switching during cognitive demand. ,   MFG connectivity appeared to be associated with the degree of language deficit, a finding supported by the notion of increased use of MFG neural resources as a compensation for impaired neural cognitive function. \n\nThe SN has been described as a task\u2010positive network that activates corresponding areas during cognitive task performance, while the cerebellum is the center of motor planning and control. Previous study has found that changes in network interactions between the DMN and SN were associated with cognitive impairment after mTBI.  The reduced FC among the DMN, ECN, and SN suggested that there was an inefficient balance and regulation among these networks, which may imply that network inhibition or network imbalance is a possible mechanism for acute cognitive impairment in mTBI. In addition to FNC abnormalities, we also found a negative correlation between the DMN\u2010ECN connection and attention scores, as well as language scores, suggesting that the uncoupling between the DMN and ECN might relate to the disrupted cognitive self\u2010regulation in acute mTBI. \n\nMany parts of visual cortex are located in areas vulnerable to mTBI, and almost 70% of sensory processing in the brain is related to vision.  Visual perception dysfunction reflects impaired visual information processing ability, which occurs frequently in mTBI.  Since the frontoparietal network is pivotal in visual\u2010spatial attention and motor function, the disconnection of the VN\u2010SMN, VN\u2010AN, and VN\u2010DMN pathways might be one factor of visual perception impairments in acute mTBI patients. Therefore, we believe that the changes in the interactions between these important networks may provide further information on how patients can adjust the connectivity of the related networks during cognitive tests. \n\nOur study has several limitations. First, this is a preliminary cross\u2010sectional study of FC changes in acute mTBI with limited sample size so that it is difficult to directly infer the causal relationship between brain functional network and cognitive impairment in mTBI. More longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed. Second, our study was based on a limited network interaction model. There are other networks that have not been considered yet may play an equally important role in the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in acute mTBI, such as the auditory network (AuN) and the self\u2010referential network (SRN). Moreover, although we have excluded the mTBI patients and HCs who complain about visual impairment, the visual acuity/corrected visual acuity was not measured. The visual function between groups will be assessed in our future research. Finally, despite the advantages of using ICA to reveal unconstrained brain connections, ICA cannot reveal the directionality of the interactions between networks. Further studies are required to assess the direct impact and direction of each network in coupling with other networks in mTBI. \n\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrated widespread early changes in intra\u2010 and inter\u2010static FNC in the acute stage after mTBI. These network interactions can provide a powerful way of evaluating and predicting cognitive impairment after mTBI and contribute to our understanding of the neural mechanisms of cognitive impairment after mTBI. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors declare no conflict of interest. \n\n\n## ETHICAL APPROVAL \n  \nThe current study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nanjing Medical University.

In addition, holistic representation plays a key role in UT and consists of a multimodal, value-related cognitive process. While the neural correlates of UT have recently been investigated, the holistic representation hypothesis of UT has not been confirmed. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to further evaluate this hypothesis by utilizing two UT tasks (person and consumer-product evaluations) in conjunction with an improved functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experimental protocol. Participants evaluated four alternatives with 12 attributes each. In the UT condition, once the decision information had been presented, the participants completed a 1-back task for 120 s and evaluated each alternative, as well as an independent 1-back task in the absence of any decision information. We then performed regression analysis of the UT performance in both tasks. Our results revealed a positive correlation between performance in the UT task and the use of the anterior part of the precuneus/paracentral lobule in the person evaluation task and between performance and the posterior part of the precuneus, postcentral gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, and superior parietal lobule in the consumer-product evaluation task. The involvement of the precuneus area in both tasks was indicative of a multimodal, value-related process and is consistent with the features of holistic representation, supporting a central role for holistic representation in UT. Furthermore, the involvement of different precuneus subregions in the two UT tasks may reflect the task dependency of the key representation critical for advantageous UT. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nResearch has revealed that we have the ability to think unconsciously. Unconscious thought (UT) refers to cognitive or affective decision-related processes that occur beyond conscious awareness, i.e., while people are consciously occupied in performing some other task ( ;  ). Research has demonstrated that UT is effective in solving complex decision-making issues. Every day, we face instances that require complex decision-making \u2013 from buying expensive things (e.g., a car) to choosing a college to attend or deciding which company to join. Such decisions typically involve a considerable amount of complex information with various dimensions and pros and cons. Most individuals believe that conscious deliberation produces the best decisions in such complex decision-making scenarios. However, previous psychological studies have refuted this idea ( ). Conscious thought (CT) is of limited use because of its low capacity ( ) and overrates the importance of some collateral attributes ( ). \n\nThe advantages of UT over CT in complex decision-making have been recognized as evidence of the existence of UT, as demonstrated by several studies using similar paradigms ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Typically, participants in such studies are initially presented with information. For example, they are instructed to read information regarding four alternatives, such as cars or roommates. Following this, they are instructed to rate each alternative on the basis of several attributes (typically 12 attributes/alternatives). The participants decide on their evaluation immediately after reading the information, after a certain period of CT, or after a period of UT during distraction. In other studies, participants performed a distractor task, such as an   n  -back task ( ) or an anagram task ( ), to prevent CT. These studies showed that in complex and multifaceted decision-making scenarios, participants who are distracted show better decision-making performance compared with those who make an immediate decision (ID) and are allowed to consciously think regarding their choices. \n\nA holistic representation of decision information is a multimodal, value-related cognitive process that may be associated with larger UT effects. Research has demonstrated that a holistic, non-feature-based mental representation of each decision alternative in UT results in improved decision-making; i.e., holistic processing produces a large UT effect. For example,   reported that UT works better when participants holistically process decision information compared with when they process feature-based rating of alternatives. Presenting decision information in blocked choice per option leads to improved decision-making once the distraction period is over ( ), and it has a larger UT effect compared with random presentation of decision information, because it stimulates the integration of information into evaluatively coherent representations ( ). Holistic representation is considered an abstract or higher-order product of the integration of multiple pieces of concrete information ( ) and is therefore comparable with a multimodal representation generated by integrating multiple unimodal inputs in a hierarchically organized cognitive system ( ). Moreover, some researchers assume bottom-up and top-down processes of impression formation ( ). Individuating information is a bottom-up process, whereas depending on a previously activated schema or stereotype is a top-down process. UT follows a bottom-up process ( ). Multimodal mental imagery is majorly UT, and several experimental findings of multimodal mentality are bottom-up processes ( ). Holistic representation is considered relevant in either assessing importance ( ;  ) or weighing information ( ) to reach an objective summary judgment ( ), which clearly indicates that holistic representation is value-oriented. Therefore, the holistic representation of UT implies the integration of value information, which is a multimodal cognitive process. \n\n performed an experiment to elucidate the neural mechanism of UT and provided the first neuroimaging findings. The stimuli in the experiment were consumer products, including cars, massage chairs, and apartments, which were used as described by  . Each decision alternative included 12 attributes. Under UT conditions, participants engaged in a 2-back distractor task after being presented with the alternatives; the same 2-back task without alternative presentation (i.e., UT) served as the control condition. The findings revealed a greater involvement of both the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left middle occipital gyrus during UT. Moreover, the substantial neural activation in both these regions was associated with improved decision-making performance during UT. The authors implied that coordinated neural activation occurs in the DLPFC and left middle occipital gyrus, indicating an unconscious visual and semantic processing of decision information. \n\nHowever, these findings and their interpretations are inconsistent with the hypothesis that UT operates on holistic representation. Typically, DLPFC is considered to be involved in \u201cconscious\u201d executive functions ( ), and the occipital gyrus is considered to be involved in visual processing; both regions have rarely been implicated in multimodal, value-related processing. Research has indicated neural activation of multimodal cortices such as medial prefrontal cortices ( ) and the precuneus ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), relevant to holistic representation. For the value processing of UT, studies have reported neural activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, and posterior cingulate cortex ( ;  ). The ventromedial prefrontal cortex plays a role in subjective ( ) and emotional ( ) values, whereas the ventral striatum ( ;  ) and posterior cingulate cortex ( ) are involved in reward value. \n\n did not identify neural activation consistent with holistic representation; this may be attributed to their research design. First, they used three different consumer products. Holistic representation, which is involved in decision-making, may differ according to the function of each alternative that is evaluated. Areas of the brain within the multimodal association cortices that represent the decision-relevant, multimodal, value-related cognitive process may vary across cars, massage chairs, and apartments. Second, the UT effect depends on the method of decision alternative presentation. In the study by  , participants were serially shown the attributes for alternatives in random order. To gain neuroscientific evidence of the holistic representation of UT, the decision information should not be presented randomly. Third, the distraction task influences the results. The study used a 2-back task. However, several experiments have demonstrated that, compared with a more taxing distraction task, a relatively light distraction task leads to better UT results ( ). For these three reasons,   were unable to identify the neural correlates of holistic representation with sufficient sensitivity. \n\nTherefore, in the present study, we have focused upon these three potential issues and improved the experimental design them to identify the neural correlates of holistic representation in UT. First, to clarify the value-related cognitive process, we used a person evaluation task as a stimulus. One type of consumer product does not include numerous attributes related to its value; hence, we cannot obtain multiple stimuli. However, the value of a person has several attributes and can provide numerous stimuli. Previous psychological research has demonstrated the advantage of UT in person evaluation tasks ( ;  ;  ;  ). In our study, to compare the differences between tasks, we conducted a consumer-product evaluation task using the same three consumer products (cars, massage chairs, and apartments) as described in the study by  . In addition, to encourage holistic representation, we presented decision information in blocked choice per option. Finally, we used a 1-back task as a distractor task. In addition, because a recent study ( ) has shown that a significant UT effect was not obtained in the average of the subjects, we supposed that the UT effect likely has huge individual differences. Therefore, we conducted a simple condition difference analysis as well as a regression analysis correlated with UT performance. We aimed to assess whether the UT advantage is associated with activation in the multimodal, value-related representation in the brain, as expected from the holistic representation hypothesis. We anticipated increased neural activation in the cortical midline structure relevant to better UT performance, which is related to the multimodal, value-related cognitive process. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe enrolled 34 healthy right-handed students (19 males and 15 females; age range, 18\u201325 years) ( ) at Tohoku University (Japan) in the study. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, with no history of neurological or psychiatric illnesses. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Tohoku University School of Medicine, and each participant provided written informed consent before the study. Data on eight participants in the person evaluation task and four in the consumer-product evaluation task were excluded owing to large head movements (>4 mm) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nThe procedures followed conformed to those reported by  . Each decision alternative was represented by a pictogram of either a human figure or a consumer product, along with 12 attributes ( ). In the person evaluation task, the decision context was modified from a study by   where participants were asked to rate a new dormitory roommate. However, because it is not common for Japanese university students to choose roommates, for our study, instead of roommates, we used university club members. For the two tasks, participants were instructed to imagine recruiting a new university club member or buying a consumer product and were presented with decision information considering four attributes (one being the most attractive, one being the least attractive, and the remaining two being intermediately attractive). They were asked to form an impression about each one and rate them using an 8-point Likert scale ranging from very positive to very negative ( ). All attributes of the person evaluation task were finalized using preparatory experiments ( ), and those of the consumer-product evaluation task were the same as those used by  . In addition,   showed their participants 12 attributes serially. However, in the present study, we showed our participants 12 attributes at a time to enhance their holistic impression and UT effectiveness ( ;  ). We were interested in the difference between neural activity during the 1-back task under UT conditions and the independent 1-back task. CT and ID were included for the purpose of comparing task performances. \n  \nExperimental task.   (A)   Presentation phase: Alternatives E\u2013H were presented in a random order for 21 s each.   (B)   Evaluation phase: Participants rated each alternative within 9 s using an 8-point Likert scale.   (C)   Under UT conditions, participants engaged in a 1-back task for 120 s between the presentation and evaluation phases. Under ID conditions, the evaluation phase was immediately followed by the presentation phase. Under CT conditions, after presenting the alternatives, participants were given 120 s to think carefully. The independent 1-back task served as the control task for UT, and participants were instructed to engage in the task. UT, unconscious thought; CT, conscious thought; ID, immediate decision. \n  \n\n### Tasks \n  \nEach session included three thought conditions (UT, CT, and ID) and one independent 1-back task ( ). Under UT conditions, after the attributes were presented for 84 s in the presentation phase, participants were distracted with a 1-back task for 120 s. In this 1-back task, participants were serially shown single-digit numbers and instructed to press a button when the current and previous numbers were the same. Thereafter, in the evaluation phase, they were instructed to rate each alternative. Participants indicated their evaluation using an MRI-compatible keypad. Fingers from the left little finger to the right little finger were assigned ratings of 1\u20138, respectively (ranging from 1 for very negative to 8 for very positive;  ). In participants who were engaged in the 1-back task, we expected that UT would occur. Under ID conditions, after the alternatives were presented, participants were instructed to rate them immediately. Under CT conditions, after alternatives were presented, participants were instructed to rate them after carefully thinking for 120 s. Overall, three sessions were conducted for the person and consumer-product evaluation tasks. The task order (person or consumer-product evaluation), thought conditions, and the independent 1-back task were randomly assigned to each participant. \n\n\n### Behavioral Data Analysis \n  \nThe evaluation performance was calculated using the conventional approach ( ) \u2013 determining the difference in evaluation between the most and least desirable choices. A higher score indicated better decision performance under each thought condition. We conducted one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the decision performance under the three thought conditions. Statistical data analysis was conducted using SPSS Statistics version 22 for Windows (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States). A   p  -value of <0.05 indicated statistical significance. \n\n\n### fMRI Experimental Procedures \n  \nFirst, participants received instructions for the task and performed practice sessions with alternatives that were not used for the fMRI experiment. Thereafter, each participant lay comfortably on the bed of the MRI scanner with their head fixed with foam blocks. All images were rear-projected onto a semi-lucent screen that could be viewed by the participant via a mirror attached to the MRI head coil. The visual angle was set at <5\u00b0. Two MRI-compatible button response boxes with four buttons attached to a plastic board were placed on the participant\u2019s abdomen, and each of the eight fingers was properly placed on the corresponding button. Stimuli were presented using PsychoPy ver. V1.84.1  ( ). \n\n\n### fMRI Data Acquisition \n  \nAll fMRI data were obtained using a 3T Philips Achieva scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands) using an echo-planar sequence sensitive to the blood oxygenation level-dependent contrast. The parameters were as follows: 64 \u00d7 64 matrix; TR = 2500 ms; TE = 30 ms; flip angle = 85\u00b0; field of view = 192 mm; and 40 slices with 2.5-mm thickness and 0.5-mm gap. The following preprocessing procedures and statistical data analysis of fMRI data were conducted using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) software (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, United Kingdom) and MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, United States): adjustment of the acquisition timing across slices, correction for head motion, spatial normalization using the EPI Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template provided in SPM, and smoothing using a Gaussian kernel with a full-width at half-maximum of 8 mm. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Analysis \n  \nStatistical analyses were conducted using a conventional two-level approach for multiple-subject fMRI datasets. For each session, we separately constructed regressors for the UT phase, independent 1-back phase, CT phase, ID instance, presentation phase (encoding), and evaluation phase. The UT phase occurred between the presentation and evaluation phases, i.e., for 120 s, during which participants performed the 1-back task. The CT phase was also placed between the presentation and evaluation phases, i.e., for 120 s, during which participants evaluated each alternative. The ID instance occurred immediately after the evaluation phase. In addition, regardless of task conditions, we set the duration of the presentation and evaluation phases to 84 and 36 s, respectively. Moreover, we set the unmodeled fixation period as the implicit baseline. We constructed a general linear model for each participant to analyze hemodynamic responses captured by functional images. The general linear model was fitted to each participant\u2019s imaging data. We generated the predicted time course of the fMRI signal by the convolution of the hypothesized neural activity with the hemodynamic response function provided in SPM12. To decrease the effects of low-frequency noise, we applied high-pass filtering with a frequency cutoff at 480 s/cycle. In the first-level analysis, we made a UT > independent 1-back task contrast for all participants. \n\nIn this study, we performed four types of group-level random-effect analyses using a similar approach to that described by  . First, we evaluated UT activation instances that were consistent across participants using voxel-wise one-sample   t  -tests for the UT > independent 1-back task. If brain regions showing significant activation were detected, we verified whether the neural activity was correlated with performance in the UT task. Second, we conducted regression analysis of the UT > independent 1-back task using whole-brain voxel-wise analysis, which revealed the brain regions with correlations between performance in the UT task and brain activity for each subject. For individual difference analyses, we used performance in the UT task itself rather than UT-CT as an indicator of UT. In terms of performance, UT-CT includes not only individual differences in UT but also individual differences in CT. Furthermore, conjunction analysis was implemented to test the commonality of brain regions between tasks in the UT phase, ascertaining whether UT is domain-general or domain-specific. Third, we investigated whether the UT and CT processes are similar or different, following the method described by  . For comparison with the results of UT > independent 1-back, we performed CT > fixation in both person and consumer-product evaluation tasks. We performed a regression analysis for CT > fixation for comparison with the regression analysis for the UT > independent 1-back task. The former approach shows differences in neural activities due to thought condition, whereas the latter approach verifies differences in brain regions that correlate with performance in each thought condition. Fourth, we tested the neural reactivation hypothesis proposed by  . According to this hypothesis, neural regions that are active during the encoding period continue to process that information during subsequent distractor tasks. For reference, we performed the conjunction analysis of UT > independent 1-back task and encoding > fixation. This analysis is performed to identify brain regions that are commonly active in UT and encoding. The statistical threshold at each voxel was   p   < 0.005 (uncorrected), which was corrected to the family-wise error of   p   < 0.05 for multiple comparisons using the cluster size. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Results \n  \nThe decision performance under UT, CT, and ID conditions was 1.72 \u00b1 2.80, 1.52 \u00b1 2.59, and 1.84 \u00b1 2.60, respectively [mean \u00b1 standard deviation] in the person evaluation task and 1.87 \u00b1 2.62, 2.08 \u00b1 3.08, and 2.40 \u00b1 2.67 in the consumer-product evaluation task, respectively. One-way ANOVA results showed that the influences of the three thought conditions were not significant (  p   > 0.05) for either person or consumer-product evaluation tasks. \n\n\n### Imaging Results \n  \nTo identify common neural correlates of the UT process across subjects, we conducted voxel-wise one-sample   t  -tests for the UT > independent 1-back task, which were intended to be a replication of  . However, no unique areas were activated during the UT distraction period compared with the independent 1-back task in either the person or consumer-product evaluation tasks. Therefore, neural correlates of the UT process were not identified as a group difference. For behavioral data, if the UT effect was significant across subjects, the relationship with UT performance was inferred. \n\nThe subject average may not be statistically significant because of large individual differences in UT. Therefore, to directly identify the neural correlates of performance in the UT task, we conducted a voxel-wise regression analysis of the performance in the UT task and activation for the UT > independent 1-back task separately for the person and consumer-product evaluation tasks. Our results indicated a significant correlation among separate areas for each task ( ). In the person evaluation task, activation spanning the precuneus and paracentral lobule ( ) was observed, whereas, in the consumer-product evaluation task, the precuneus, postcentral gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, and superior parietal lobule ( ) were positively correlated with performance in the UT task. The observed brain activation patterns and related cognitive processes were considered to explain performance in the UT task. As expected, these regions consisted of cortical midline structures involved in a multimodal and value-related cognitive process. To identify a common cognitive process related to the performance of the two UT tasks, conjunction analysis of the person and consumer-product evaluation tasks under UT conditions performed. However, our results did not reveal a common activation pattern or process that could explain the performance in the two UT tasks. \n  \nSignificant neural activity in voxel-wise regression analysis for the UT > independent 1-back task. \n      \nNeural correlates of decision performance under UT conditions in   (A)   person and   (B)   consumer-product evaluation tasks. Brain regions showing task-specific activation were identified using multiple regression analysis. Regional neural activation was superimposed on a sagittal section of anatomical images obtained using SPM12.   (A)   Graph indicating the activation profile for the precuneus/paracentral lobule.   (B)   Graph indicating the activation profile for the precuneus. \n  \nFor CT > fixation, the voxel-wise one-sample   t  -test was applied to identify neural correlates of the CT process common across subjects. This analysis suggested a significant neural activation of distinct cortical areas for the person and consumer-product evaluation tasks. For the person evaluation task, the insula (  x   = \u221242,   y   = \u22124,   z   = 12, and   T   = 5.64;   p   < 0.001) and DLPFC (  x   = \u221258,   y   = 8,   z   = 24, and   T   = 5.21;   p   < 0.001) were identified. For the consumer-product evaluation task, the ventral occipital cortex (  x   = \u221218,   y   = \u221290,   z   = \u221216, and   T   = 5.71;   p   = 0.012), caudate (  x   = \u221212,   y   = 10,   z   = \u22122, and   T   = 5.07;   p   = 0.014), and inferior parietal lobule (  x   = \u221254,   y   = \u221220,   z   = 20, and   T   = 5.06;   p   = 0.002) were identified. In addition, we observed that different brain regions were active for the performance of the CT task. In other words, we confirmed the task dependency of CT in this experiment. However, regression analysis of performance in the CT task on the activation of CT > fixation did not reveal any significant activation for either of the tasks. In other words, an activation pattern that could explain performance in each UT task was not identified. \n\nFor the conjunction analysis of UT > independent 1-back task and encoding > fixation, which was performed to identify neural correlates of common processes in UT and encoding, no significant activation was observed for either of the tasks. Therefore, our results were not supportive of the neural reactivation hypothesis, which states that the activation of the same area occurs during the encoding and UT distraction period ( ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we explored the neural correlates of the holistic representation of UT using a single-domain alternative (i.e., person evaluation). We found activation that was correlated with performance in the UT task. Our results suggest that performance is correlated with specific activation during distraction\u2014when UT theoretically operates; this is consistent with the possibility that unique UT processes lead to improved performance. The advantage of UT in complex decision-making scenarios is due to its holistic representation, although previous neuroimaging findings have not supported this hypothesis. In the present study, in addition to the single-domain alternative, we presented information in blocked choice per option, and, to obtain a large UT effect, we used a 1-back task as a distractor task. The present study provided the first neuroimaging finding that demonstrates the validity of the cognitive hypothesis that the advantage of UT is its holistic representation. A correlation between neural activity during UT and decision performance was observed, with activity in the precuneus or its adjacent region, in both person and consumer-product evaluation tasks. Our results indicate that the decision performance of UT is explained by the neural activity of this brain region during UT. The cortical midline structure, including the precuneus, is active during multimodal, value-related cognitive processes, which is consistent with the features of holistic representation. \n\nSeveral studies have supported the role of the precuneus in holistic representation: the precuneus integrates multimodal information collected from various brain regions, thereby playing an important role in mental image processing ( ;  ;  ). These functional characteristics are consistent with the concept of multimodal processing of holistic representation. \n\nEvaluation-relevant holistic representation can vary between decision items. The present study identified no brain regions common to both tasks. Thus, the brain mechanism of UT could be domain-specific. The notion that the UT process is highly task-dependent is supported by a previous finding that the neural basis of creative cognition is highly task-dependent ( ). Moreover, this finding is consistent with the spatially dissociable value representations within the precuneus ( ;  ). In this study, strictly, decision performance under UT conditions was positively correlated with the activity in the anterior part of the precuneus/paracentral lobule in the person evaluation task and with that in the posterior part of the precuneus in the consumer-product evaluation task. In the person evaluation task, the positive correlation might holistically represent the social quality of the individual, who is relevant to the interpersonal relationship. Reportedly, the anterior part of the precuneus/paracentral lobule is involved in mentalization, such as emotions and feelings ( ;  ;  ). Mentalizing refers to inferring the mental state of others. An individual\u2019s mental state determines their actions, and it is important for us to be able to accurately understand the minds of others because several inferences are automatically made without any thought or deliberation ( ). In addition, the anterior part of the precuneus/paracentral lobule is activated when we consider our own preferences, not when thinking of others\u2019 preferences ( ). This brain region is related to affective aspects of social cognition, such as empathy ( ) and social exclusion ( ,  ). Therefore, in the present study, it was observed that the anterior part of the precuneus/paracentral lobule controlled holistic representation, unconsciously processing the degree of the participants\u2019 likes and dislikes in the social context of choosing university club members. Participants unconsciously made decisions with regard to the four alternatives presented in the person evaluation task. \n\nBy contrast, the neural activity of the posterior part of the precuneus correlating with decision performance in the consumer-product evaluation task might holistically represent the hedonic quality of consumer products, which is directly relevant to purchase decisions. The posterior part of the precuneus is related to reward processing ( ;  ;  ). Further, this brain region corresponds to tool use ( ;  ). Consumer products are worth their function, in addition to the reward of owning them. Therefore, neural activation may represent a reward for the purchase decision made in the form of the functional aspect of the consumer product bought. The UT phenomenon appears similar in different psychological studies, but investigating the brain mechanism proves that its quality depends on the task being performed. \n\nThe neural activity of brain regions outside the precuneus that are correlated with decision performance might be related to the organization of the information presented, creating a three-dimensional image and simulating their use in the consumer-product evaluation task. The postcentral gyrus, considered the primary somatosensory cortex ( ), plays an important role in the time and space integration of visual and tactile stimuli ( ). The neural activity observed in the postcentral gyrus might be related to the images of unconsciously using each consumer product. Therefore, the images might be integrated in the brain as if the consumer products imaged are indeed being used. Results regarding the neural activation of the middle occipital gyrus obtained in the present study coincide with the findings reported by  . The middle occipital gyrus plays an important role in the brain\u2019s visual processing. As   suggested, this brain region unconsciously maintains the visual representation of decision information. The superior parietal lobule is associated with visuospatial perception, including the representation and manipulation of objects ( ). It is possible that participants could imagine using the consumer products by building a stereoscopic image of each product from the stimuli presented. Interestingly, these three brain regions correspond to the complex involving mental rotation ( ). The brain regions verified in the present study appear to be consistent with this hypothesis. \n\nThe discrepancy between our results and those of   may provide important insights into current issues related to UT.   did not identify the activation of the cortical midline structure, whereas we did not replicate the activation of the DLPFC. There were two reasons for this: the difference in alternative presentation and the analysis method. In the present study, decision information was presented in blocked choice per option to encourage holistic representation. By contrast,   showed decision information serially in the presentation phase. When alternatives are serially presented, participants need to process each alternative; this requires a cognitive load of executive function. Information processing might have been related to the assumption of executive function, including working memory ( ). This can be interpreted as the cortical midline structure, rather than the DLPFC, being activated because the process of serially organizing each attribute is unnecessary; instead, holistic representation is required. The serial presentation of decision information and the distractor task (1-back vs. 2-back) load in the study by   were insufficient for holistic representation during UT. Activation of the DLPFC in the previous study might represent a load of working memory because of the serial presentation of decision information. In the present study, we conducted regression analysis for the UT > independent 1-back task using whole-brain voxel-wise analysis, whereas   conducted the UT > independent 1-back task using an across-subject design. Therefore, they probably overlooked neural activity correlated with decision performance. It was possible to examine the brain network directly related to the UT effect without omission of searches from the entire brain. Compared with the analytical approaches used by  , our approaches were advantageous in this regard. \n\n provided important insights into UT research; however, their cognitive hypothesis did not refer to conventional UT research.   hypothesized that neural reactivation, occurring in the extrastriate and prefrontal regions, explains the manner in which UT improves decision-making. We acknowledge that their cognitive hypothesis and neural evidence were independent of \u2013 or even potentially contradictory to \u2013 the theoretical framework of the accumulated psychological literature on the UT process. Their neural reactivation hypothesis, supported by neural evidence (i.e., activation of the visual and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices), appears rather to conform to the feature-based top-down characteristics assumed for the CT process ( ;  ) in the previous psychological literature on UT. By contrast, our results are consistent with the conventional framework of holistic representation in the psychological literature. \n\nThe present research provides evidence for a psychological UT mechanism. Distinguishing between common UT and advantageous UT processes might be more important. As shown by the several behavioral experiments as well as by our regression analysis, a large UT advantage is caused by blocked presentation and potentially involves holistic representation in multimodal, value-related networks. By contrast, in the UT task, a feature-based top-down process may be involved, particularly in the case of serial presentation, as shown by  . This finding may help in understanding the psychological UT mechanism. Regarding CT, the voxel-wise one-sample   t  -test for CT > fixation indicated significant neural activation in both person and consumer-product evaluation tasks, but the regression analysis for CT > fixation did not give a significant result. We considered the discussion of the former results irrelevant because we did not observe significant findings in UT > independent 1-back for comparison, and activation in CT > fixation itself reflected the various non-specific cognitive processes involved in both tasks. Although we were unable to discuss further regarding the CT mechanism in the present research, we were able to update the psychological mechanism of UT. \n\nIt may be important to note that we failed to replicate the average UT advantage across all participants. Research has demonstrated that there is room for reconsideration in UT behavior data. For example,   replicated the study by   under the same UT conditions as were used by   and noted that UT conditions did not improve decision performance compared with the other conditions. Therefore,   performed the same experiment using approximately 400 participants, which is approximately 10-fold more than other UT-related studies, and reported that UT conditions did not lead to the most desirable choice compared with the other conditions. However, importantly, considering that these studies did not report significantly lower performance under UT than that under CT conditions, it is highly likely that some UT process occurs to attain a similar level of decision performance as that observed under CT conditions. UT may exhibit substantial individual differences, like ID and CT, and brain measurement could be the main method for its measurement. In psychological research, the existence of UT is denied unless a significant difference is obtained. Furthermore, in this research field, it is debated whether the UT task indeed guarantees that the individual\u2019s thinking process is unconscious ( ;  ). However, on examining the relationship with brain activity, as shown in the present study, the correlation between the UT effect and the brain activity of the individual reveals the neural basis of UT as well as possibly proving that UT exists for some individuals. If the UT effect is merely a noise of the behavior parameter, no correlation with significant brain activity can be obtained. There are individual differences between ID and CT, and because these are rational\u2013experiential-thinking styles, we can measure them using the Rational\u2013Experiential Inventory developed by  . However, although it is difficult to measure UT using questionnaires, we can measure unconscious psychological processes using brain measurements. The fact that we identified individual differences in UT performance using brain measurements in the present study demonstrates that there is a brain index for the evaluation of individual differences in UT. \n\nUse of different types of decision items can help reveal the entire brain mechanism of UT in UT study. Decision-making research has advanced by the traditional two-level approaches of intuition and rationality ( ). Therefore, commonly, we only use either of the two thinking modes \u2013 ID and CT \u2013 for decision-making. Classically, only ID and CT were studied, and UT recently became a subject of research. The present study demonstrated the potential importance of the quality of UT. The neural activation of UT differs on the basis of task. The effect of UT is observed in other decision-making scenarios, such as lie detection ( ), responses to client requests ( ), moral situations ( ), and product satisfaction improvements ( ). Although these studies proved the effectiveness of UT, the brain mechanism in each could be different. In the future, UT can be studied in various research fields such as management or political science. It is anticipated that functional neuroimaging studies will reveal the mechanism of the unconscious decision-making process and will lead to fruitful progress in decision-making research. \n\nOne limitation of the present study was a methodological limitation common to other UT studies. In this study, the attributes of desirable university club members or consumer products were based on the element that would be desirable for most individuals. Therefore, the optimal choice was defined by the option having the highest number of positive qualities. However, this method is not reasonable. An option with numerous positive qualities is not always the best option for everybody. For example, even if a car scores well on several attributes, some individuals may not like it because it is a car with manual transmission ( ). To advance UT research in the future, changing this methodology might be necessary. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Tohoku University School of Medicine, and each participant provided written informed consent before the study. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nTK, RK, and MS designed the research.

What are the neural mechanisms that enable the perception of one's   entire   body as a unified entity? In one behavioral and one fMRI multivoxel pattern analysis experiment, we used a full-body illusion to investigate how congruent visuo-tactile signals from a single body part facilitate the emergence of the sense of ownership of the entire body. To elicit this illusion, participants viewed the body of a mannequin from the first-person perspective via head-mounted displays while synchronous touches were applied to the hand, abdomen, or leg of the bodies of the participant and the mannequin; asynchronous visuo-tactile stimuli served as controls. The psychometric data indicated that the participants perceived ownership of the entire artificial body regardless of the body segment that received the synchronous visuo-tactile stimuli. Based on multivoxel pattern analysis, we found that the neural responses in the left ventral premotor cortex displayed illusion-specific activity patterns that generalized across all tested pairs of body parts. Crucially, a tripartite generalization analysis revealed the   whole-body   specificity of these premotor activity patterns. Finally, we also identified multivoxel patterns in the premotor, intraparietal, and lateral occipital cortices and in the putamen that reflected multisensory responses specific to individual body parts. Based on these results, we propose that the dynamic formation of a whole-body percept may be mediated by neuronal populations in the ventral premotor cortex that contain visuo-tactile receptive fields encompassing multiple body segments. \n   Highlights  \n  \nWe examine the neural and perceptual correlates of whole-body ownership. \n  \nBehavioral findings describe the formation of a whole-body multisensory percept. \n  \nWe use multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data to explore the linked neural basis. \n  \nActivity patterns in the ventral premotor cortex reflect a whole-body percept. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFew things are as thoroughly engrained in our perceptual experience of the world as our own body, and the origins of the sense of bodily self have intrigued philosophers and scientists for centuries ( ). Recent advances have associated the integration of spatio-temporally interrelated visual, tactile, and proprioceptive signals in multisensory brain regions with the experience of a limb as a part of one's body ( ). However, these accounts of limb ownership cannot fully characterize the perception of one's   entire   body as a unified entity, i.e., a multisensory percept that extends beyond a fragmented set of individual anatomical segments ( ). Recently, cognitive neuroscientists have employed \u201cfull-body illusions\u201d to examine how a whole-body percept is formed ( ). Based on the characterization of the perceptual rules that govern the elicitation of these illusions and the identification of the corresponding illusion-specific brain responses, relevant insights can be gained regarding the processes that underlie whole-body perception under natural conditions ( ). \n\nIn the full-body illusion paradigm introduced by  , the delivery of synchronous touches to the body of a mannequin viewed from the first-person perspective and the corresponding location on the participant's unviewed body elicits a perception of ownership of the mannequin's body. A plethora of subsequent studies has suggested that this illusion can be explained within a multisensory theoretical framework in which the brain integrates spatio-temporally congruent signals in egocentric spatial reference frames ( ). Neuroimaging evidence suggests that the generalization of ownership may be mediated by neuronal populations in the ventral premotor cortex that contain large visuo-somatic receptive fields encompassing multiple body segments ( ). However, the previous behavioral ( ; see also  ) and neuroimaging ( ) studies that have addressed the key issue of the generalization of ownership from the stimulated body part to the entire body included only a single pair of body segments: the abdomen and the hand. However, the characterization of this generalization of ownership requires the systematic examination of an illusion across at least three anatomically distant body segments to enable inferences regarding the mechanisms that pertain to the whole body. \n\nHere, we adapted   full-body illusion paradigm and conducted one behavioral and one fMRI experiment to investigate the generalization of ownership across three separate body parts: the right hand, the abdomen, and the right leg. The psychometric data confirmed that the participants experienced ownership of all body parts, regardless of which parts received visuo-tactile stimulation. More importantly, the fMRI experiment revealed multivoxel patterns in the left ventral premotor cortex that reflect ownership across all combinations of body parts (hand to/from abdomen; hand to/from leg; and leg to/from abdomen). Crucially, tripartite generalization analysis identified illusion-specific patterns across all three stimulation sites. Taken together, these results suggest a potential cortical mechanism underlying the formation of a whole-body percept via the integration of multisensory signals across multiple body segments. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-two healthy participants (5 females, age range 19\u201341\u00a0years) were recruited for the behavioral experiment (Experiment 1). A different group of 16 healthy participants (5 females, age range 20\u201359\u00a0years) participated in the functional brain imaging experiment (Experiment 2). All participants were right-handed, exhibited normal or corrected-to-normal vision and reported no history of neurological or sensory disorders. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experimental sessions, and all participants received monetary compensation. The Regional Ethical Review Board of Stockholm approved this study. \n\n\n### Experiment 1: behavioral investigation of the generalization of the perception of body ownership \n  \n#### Experimental setup \n  \nWe adapted a previously validated experimental paradigm to elicit the perceptual illusion of owning an entire artificial body ( ). In this paradigm, the participant wore a pair of head-mounted displays (45 degree field-of-view in the horizontal plane) through which a stereoscopic image of the body of a mannequin was projected ( A). Both the participant and the mannequin were placed comfortably in a supine position, which was consistent with the posture of the participants during the fMRI experiment. Furthermore, the participant observed the body of the mannequin from the first-person perspective, thereby ensuring a match between the viewed and perceived positions of the artificial and veridical bodies, respectively. A trained experimenter applied touches to one of three different body parts (hand, abdomen, or leg;  A) on the bodies of both the participant and the mannequin. The visuo-tactile stimuli were delivered in a synchronous (full temporal overlap) or asynchronous (fully non-overlapping) manner for 2-minute intervals. The synchronous mode of visuo-tactile stimulation induces the illusion of ownership of the mannequin's body, whereas the asynchronous mode serves as a control for otherwise equivalent conditions ( ). The 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 factorial design (body part\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0visuo-tactile stimulation mode) resulted in 6 experimental conditions, the order of which was randomized across the participants. At the end of each 2-minute interval of visuo-tactile stimulation, the participants were presented with a questionnaire composed of 8 separate statements that were rated on a 7-point Likert scale, which ranged from \u2212\u00a03 (\u201c  I fully disagree with the statement  \u201d) to +\u00a03 (\u201c  I fully agree with the statement  \u201d). The complete list of questionnaire items is reported in  . The first two statements (S1 and S2) captured the illusory referral of somatic sensations to the virtual body for each of the three body parts investigated. Statements S3, S4, and S5 probed the perceptual generalization of the perception of body ownership from the stimulated body part to the whole body in a manner that was compatible with the emergence of a whole-body percept. Finally, statements S6, S7, and S8 served as controls for task compliance and suggestibility. To maintain the corresponding psychometric and neural assessments of the generalization of the feeling of ownership as independent from each other as possible, the behavioral and neuroimaging experiments were performed on two separate groups of na\u00efve participants. Although this approach did not enable a within-group examination of the relationship between the psychometric and neuroimaging data, it assured the full independence of the findings from the two experiments. \n\n\n#### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nThe questionnaire data were assessed for normality using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test in SPSS 20 (IBM Corporation, USA). For data that did not pass the test for normality, we used non-parametric statistics to evaluate the significance of the comparisons of interest. The individual ratings for statements S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5 (see   for details) did not pass the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test for normality and were analyzed using non-parametric tests (results reported in  C, D,  A, and B). Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests were used to compare the condition-specific ranks, and positive correlations were evaluated for significance using Kendall's tau bivariate correlation tests. All statistical tests comprised planned comparisons between the conditions of interest and the control conditions (  Synch   vs.   Asynch  ), and the planned correlation analyses were also formulated as a priori hypotheses. Based on our strong a priori predictions regarding the direction of the behavioral results ( ), we report one-tailed tests throughout the presentation of the results. The significance threshold was set to 5%. \n\n\n\n### Experiment 2: neural mechanisms of the generalization of the feeling of body ownership \n  \n#### Experimental setup \n  \nWe used a previously validated experimental setup to induce the perceptual illusion of owning an entire virtual body in the environment of an MRI scanner ( ). The participants laid comfortably in a supine position on the bed of the MRI scanner. Their head was propped up (~\u00a030\u00b0) using a custom-made wooden wedge and foam pads to allow the participants to look directly into a pair of MR-compatible head-mounted displays (Nordic Neuro Lab, Bergen, Norway; field of view 30\u00b0 horizontal\u00a0\u00d7\u00a023\u00b0 vertical; resolution 800\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0600), which was positioned in front of their eyes. The visual stimuli were presented to the participants via the head-mounted displays using a computer running Presentation software (version 13.1, NeuroBehavioral System, Pennsylvania, USA) and consisted of a series of pre-recorded videos that featured the experimental conditions of interest (details in the subsequent section). The visual stimuli were recorded using a red/blue stereoscopic camera (Novo Minoru, Salford, United Kingdom) and were presented to the participants as three-dimensional stimuli by superimposing red and blue filters in front of the left and right head-mounted displays, respectively. Tactile stimuli were manually applied by a trained experimenter who was positioned on the participant's right side at all times during the acquisition session. The experimenter was trained to minimize the range of motion associated with the delivery of the tactile stimuli, thereby avoiding potential motion-induced artifacts in the acquired images. The experimenter received auditory instructions related to the timing and location (hand, abdomen, or leg) of the tactile stimuli during each trial. Importantly, the auditory cues were designed to ensure that the experimenter was blinded to the sequence and type (synchronous vs. asynchronous) of each condition. The na\u00efve participants were instructed to passively observe the visual stimuli presented via the head-mounted displays and to not engage in any task. \n\n\n#### Experimental conditions and design \n  \nAnalogous to the behavioral experiment, the visuo-tactile stimuli were applied to three different body parts on both the 3D-video image of the body of the mannequin (in view) and the corresponding part of the participant's body (not in view). Under the experimental conditions of interest, the participants were presented with three-dimensional video recordings of the body of the mannequin viewed from the first-person perspective in a manner that ensured a match between the viewed and perceived postures of the virtual and veridical bodies, respectively ( A). The visuo-tactile stimuli were applied to the right hand, the right side of the abdomen, or the right upper leg for a period of 35\u00a0s ( B). Each trial contained 30 individual visuo-tactile stimuli, which consisted of brisk strokes delivered by the experimenter's right index finger and spanned a 5-cm trajectory on the corresponding body part. The visuo-tactile stimuli were delivered either completely synchronously (  Hand Synch  ,   Abdomen Synch  , and   Leg Synch  ) or asynchronously, in which a delay of approximately 1\u00a0s was introduced between the visual and tactile stimuli (  Hand Asynch  ,   Abdomen Asynch  , and   Leg Asynch  ). The synchronous mode of visuo-tactile stimulation induces the full-body ownership illusion, whereas the asynchronous mode serves as a control for the otherwise equivalent experimental conditions ( ). Furthermore, the participants were presented with trials in which the mannequin's virtual body was removed, with the exception of the right arm, which was presented in an implausible detached posture (  Detached Hand  ;  A). Identical periods of visuo-tactile stimulation were delivered to the detached virtual right arm in either a synchronous (  Detached Hand Synch  ) or asynchronous manner (  Detached Hand Asynch  ). A previous study revealed that this condition significantly reduces the perceptual illusion of owning the mannequin's body ( ). Importantly, the   Detached Hand   condition provides an experimental term of comparison to elucidate the multisensory integrative effects that are specific to the context of an entire body. Moreover, it enables rigorous control for potential differences in brain activity produced by the two modes of visuo-tactile stimulation (synchronous vs. asynchronous) that do not reflect the illusion-specific perceptual integration of the visual and tactile signals in the context of an entire body ( ). Thus, the experimental design consisted of eight different conditions presented in a random order. The trials were grouped in two blocks of eight during each acquisition session. A 3-second baseline interval that consisted of a black screen and no visuo-tactile stimuli was inserted between consecutive trials, whereas an identical 20-second baseline interval was inserted between the two blocks of trials during each session. Four sessions were acquired, which resulted in eight repetitions of each of the eight experimental conditions of interest. \n\n\n#### FMRI data acquisition \n  \nFMRI acquisition was performed using a Siemens TIM Trio 3\u00a0T scanner equipped with a 12-channel head coil. Gradient echo T2*-weighted EPIs with BOLD contrast were used as an index of brain activity ( ). The functional image volume was composed of 47 continuous near-axial slices of 3\u00a0mm thickness (with a 0.1\u00a0mm interslice gap), which ensured that the entire brain was within the FOV (58\u00a0\u00d7\u00a076 matrix; 3.0\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.0\u00a0mm in-plane resolution; TE\u00a0=\u00a040\u00a0ms; and flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0). One complete volume was collected every 3\u00a0s (TR\u00a0=\u00a03000\u00a0ms). The first three volumes of each session were discarded to account for non-steady state magnetization. To facilitate the anatomical localization of statistically significant activations, a high-resolution structural image was acquired for each participant at the end of the experiment (3D MPRAGE sequence: voxel size\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm; FOV\u00a0=\u00a0250\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0250\u00a0mm; 176 slices; TR\u00a0=\u00a01900\u00a0ms; TE\u00a0=\u00a02.27\u00a0ms; and flip angle\u00a0=\u00a09\u00b0). \n\n\n#### Data preprocessing \n  \nThe functional imaging data were processed using SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, London, UK) and Matlab scripts, which were adapted from the Princeton Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis Toolbox ( ). The functional volumes were realigned to the first volume of each series, corrected for slice-timing errors, and co-registered to the high-resolution structural image. The high-resolution structural image was segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid regions and normalized to the standard MNI space. Then, the identical transformation was applied to all functional images, which were re-sliced to a resolution of 2\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0mm and spatially smoothed using an 8\u00a0mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. The response of each voxel was normalized to the average time course within each scan. To enable the induction of the illusion of owning the virtual mannequin's body, the first 10\u00a0s of each trial were excluded from the multivoxel analyses. This procedure has been validated in a series of previously published behavioral and fMRI experiments ( ). Prior to the multivoxel analyses, single-trial estimates were calculated by averaging the BOLD response across the remaining 25\u00a0s of visuo-tactile stimulation in each trial for each condition separately. Given the long duration of each trial and the exclusion of the first 10\u00a0s from the multivoxel analyses, we did not explicitly model the hemodynamic response function in the single-trial estimation. \n\n\n#### Multivoxel pattern analyses \n  \nWe employed locally multivariate mapping ( ) to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the construction of a unified perceptual representation of one's own body from the representation of its individual parts. Individual functional volumes were randomly partitioned into approximately spherical search volumes displaying a radius of 3\u00a0voxels. In each search volume, multivoxel classification analysis was applied, yielding a decoding accuracy for the analysis of interest (see below for details). Then, each voxel was assigned the average decoding accuracy calculated across all search volumes, including the given voxel. Multivoxel classification was performed using a linear support vector machine (in the LIBSVM implementation using fixed regularization parameter C\u00a0=\u00a01;  ). \n\nFirst, we performed multivoxel pattern analysis to identify the voxels whose BOLD response patterns encoded the illusion-specific integration of visual and tactile signals   across   the different body parts that received multisensory stimulation (hand, abdomen, or leg). Thus, this analysis identified the voxels that generalized the illusory integrations of visuo-tactile signals across multiple body parts in a manner that was compatible with the construction of a multisensory percept of the whole owned body. This result would be expected from neuronal populations containing visuo-tactile receptive fields that encompass multiple body segments or the entire body. Linear classifiers were trained to decode the differences in the BOLD response patterns generated by the   Synch   and   Asynch   conditions for a given body part in each participant (  Hand Synch   vs.   Hand Asynch  ;   Abdomen Synch   vs.   Abdomen Asynch  ; and   Leg Synch   vs.   Leg Asynch  ). Then, the trained classifiers were tested on the untrained data from the remaining body parts. For example, a classifier trained to decode   Hand Synch   vs.   Hand Asynch   was evaluated with respect to the response patterns generated by   Abdomen Synch   vs.   Abdomen Asynch   and   Leg Synch   vs.   Leg Asynch   ( C). Then, we calculated the average decoding accuracy for a given pairwise classification (e.g., the average decoding accuracy of a classifier trained on   Hand   and tested on   Abdomen   and, inversely, a classifier trained on   Abdomen   and tested on   Hand  ). This procedure generated three average pairwise decoding maps (  Hand and Abdomen  ,   Hand and Leg  , and   Abdomen and Leg  ) for each participant. Then, the chance level (50%) was subtracted from each decoding map, followed by spatial smoothing using an 8\u00a0mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Next, the maps were evaluated via group random effect analysis using SPM8 to test for voxelwise statistical significance. The whole brain significance threshold was set to a p-value of 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons using the family-wise error rate (FWE). Given our strong a priori hypotheses, we performed small-volume corrections (at the same threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE) in a left ventral premotor region of interest derived from a previous study ( ). This approach ensured that none of the analyses performed were statistically circular. The same procedure was applied to all further analyses described in the following section. For descriptive purposes only, we report the peak decoding accuracies for the analyses of interest in  . The individual decoding accuracies were extracted from a 10-mm radius sphere centered on the group peaks reported in  , and the group averages and standard errors were calculated and are reported for the sake of completeness. \n\nSecond, we performed a multivoxel analysis that included the   Detached Hand   condition as a control analysis (as described above). The identical linear classifiers as those defined above, which were trained to detect the response patterns that were specific to the perceptual integration of the visual and tactile signals from a given body part (  Hand Synch   vs.   Hand Asynch  ;   Abdomen Synch   vs.   Abdomen Asynch  ; or   Leg Synch   vs.   Leg Asynch  ), were tested on the response patterns generated by   Detached Hand Synch   vs.   Detached Hand Asynch  . The inverse procedure was also performed. This analysis allowed us to test the hypothesis that the multivoxel patterns identified by the previous analysis preferentially reflected the perceptual integration of visuo-tactile information from a given body part in the whole-body context. Furthermore, this analysis enabled us to rule out non-specific differences in the response patterns between the   Synch   and   Asynch   conditions, which might otherwise contribute to the results of the primary multivoxel analyses. \n\nThird, we built upon the generalization analysis described above to further evaluate the hypothesis that the neuronal populations whose illusion-specific response patterns were generalized across the three body parts were associated with multisensory receptive fields that encompass all three body parts. In light of the previous set of analyses alone, it cannot be conclusively ruled out that the pairwise generalization findings obtained from the above analyses, namely,   Hand\u2013Abdomen  ,   Hand\u2013Leg  , and   Abdomen\u2013Leg  , might be ascribed to neuronal populations containing visuo-tactile receptive fields that incorporate only two of the three body parts investigated. To test for the existence of neuronal populations containing visuo-tactile receptive fields that are sufficiently large to encompass all three body parts, and are, therefore, compatible with the construction of a whole-body percept, we conducted a new set of multivoxel analyses. Specifically, linear classifiers were first trained to detect differences between the response patterns between the   Synch   and   Asynch   stimulation conditions across two of the three body parts (for example,   Hand Synch, Abdomen Synch   vs.   Hand Asynch, Abdomen Asynch  ). Then, the classifiers were tested on the untrained data from the remaining body part (for example,   Leg Synch   vs.   Leg Asynch  ). If the response patterns from which a classifier was trained arose from neuronal populations containing visuo-tactile receptive fields that extended to only two body parts (the hand and the abdomen in the example provided above), then no significant generalization to the third tested body part would be expected (the leg in the example provided above). Hence, significant results from this analysis would identify the neuronal populations containing multisensory receptive fields that are sufficiently large to encompass all three anatomically distant body parts. \n\nFourth, we performed an independent set of multivoxel analyses to identify the multisensory response patterns that are specific to only one of the body parts investigated. Unlike the analyses described above, this investigation was targeted at neuronal populations containing visuo-tactile receptive fields that are restricted to a specific body part and its surrounding area. This finding would be compatible with the well-known existence of neuronal populations that integrate congruent visual and tactile signals to generate body part-specific representations of different body segments ( ). We first trained and tested linear classifiers to decode the differences in the patterns of brain activity that corresponded to all pairwise comparisons between the three body parts under the   Synch   stimulation conditions (  Hand Synch   vs.   Abdomen Synch  ;   Hand Synch   vs.   Leg Synch  ; and   Abdomen Synch   vs.   Leg Synch  ;  A). A 10-fold cross-validation procedure was used to compute the decoding accuracies for each pairwise comparison. Next, we applied an equivalent classification analysis to the corresponding pairwise comparisons under the   Asynch   stimulation conditions (  Hand Asynch   vs.   Abdomen Asynch  ;   Hand Asynch   vs.   Leg Asynch  ; and   Abdomen Asynch   vs.   Leg Asynch  ). Then, we performed a second-level analysis by combining the data from the three pairwise comparisons into average decoding maps for the   Synch   and   Asynch   conditions and by subtracting the map for the   Asynch   condition from the map for the   Synch   condition. These second-level analyses were performed using SPM8 according to the procedure described above. Small volume corrections (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE) were performed around peaks based on an earlier study ( ). For descriptive purposes only, in  , we also report the significant pairwise peaks for the   Synch   decoding maps that were associated with the significant group decoding peaks from the average   Synch   minus   Asynch   analysis. These peaks were masked exclusively with the regions associated with the   Asynch   pairwise decoding maps, which were thresholded at p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, uncorrected for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results: the emergence of the whole-body multisensory percept \n  \nWe adopted a previously validated setup to induce the perceptual illusion of ownership of a mannequin's body viewed from the first-person perspective via a set of head-mounted displays ( ). In contrast to previous behavioral studies, we induced this illusion by applying synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation to one of three different body parts\u2014the right hand, abdomen, or leg\u2014and then systematically assessed the strength of the subjective feeling of ownership of each of the three body parts. We tested the hypothesis that the subjective feeling of ownership generalizes from the stimulated body part to the entire body. \n\nWe first analyzed the average subjective ratings for statements S1 and S2 ( ) to confirm the successful induction of the perceptual illusion of referring somatic sensations to an artificial body regardless of the body part that received the visuo-tactile stimulation (hand, abdomen, or leg). Because these statements referred to the perceptual integration of the visual and tactile stimuli, this analysis served as an initial assessment of the overall efficacy of the experimental manipulation employed to elicit this illusion, which was performed prior to the evaluation of the generalization of the feeling of ownership to the non-stimulated body parts (subsequent paragraph). We performed repeated measures analysis of variance on the factors   Statement Type   (  Illusion  , average of S1 and S2;   Control  , average of S6, S7, and S8) and   Stimulation Mode   (  Synch  ;   Asynch  ) after pooling the data for the three different body parts. We detected a significant interaction between these two factors (F(1,21)\u00a0=\u00a05.89; p\u00a0=\u00a00.024;  B). Furthermore, a post-hoc   t  -test revealed a significant difference in the average subjective ratings for the illusion statements (S1 and S2) between the   Synch   and   Asynch   conditions (t(21)\u00a0=\u00a03.15, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002;  B). Identical results were found for each of the three body parts when analyzed separately (Hand: Z\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.696, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003; Abdomen: Z\u00a0=\u00a01.876, p\u00a0=\u00a00.030; and Leg: Z\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.489, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006; all Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests;  C). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the average illusion scores between S1 and S2, which were computed as the difference between the ratings for the   Synch   and   Asynch   conditions between all pairs of stimulated body parts (all p\u00a0>\u00a00.3). Thus, these findings confirmed that the participants experienced a referral of somatic sensations to the artificial body regardless of the body segment that received the visuo-tactile stimulation. The subjective strength of this illusory perceptual experience did not differ based on the body part that received visuo-tactile stimulation. Finally, we detected positive linear correlations between the subjective ratings (average of S1 and S2;   Synch   minus   Asynch  ) associated with the visuo-tactile stimulation of one body part and the corresponding ratings associated with the visuo-tactile stimulation of the other two body parts (Hand and Abdomen, Kendall's tau\u00a0=\u00a00.634, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; Hand and Leg, tau\u00a0=\u00a00.253. p\u00a0=\u00a00.055; and Abdomen and Leg, tau\u00a0=\u00a00.495, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001;  D). \n\nSecond, we examined whether the perceptual integration of visuo-tactile signals from one body part would generate a subjective feeling of ownership over the artificial body that generalized to the entire body, i.e., including the body segments that were not stimulated. Thus, we analyzed the subjective ratings for statements S3, S4, and S5, which referred to the strength of the experienced feeling of ownership of the hand, abdomen, or leg, respectively ( ; see   for details), under the   Synch   and   Asynch   conditions. We first averaged the subjective ratings across the two body parts that did   not   receive the visuo-tactile stimulation under the condition of interest (for example, the strength of the feeling of ownership of the abdomen and the leg after stimulation of the hand). Then, we compared these scores between the   Synch   and   Asynch   conditions and detected a significant difference (t(21)\u00a0=\u00a04.822, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Significantly different ratings between the   Synch   and   Asynch   conditions, respectively, were detected for each body part, regardless of the body segment that received the visuo-tactile stimulation (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05;  A). Furthermore, we found that the illusion scores (  Synch   minus   Asynch  ) for a given body part did not differ between the conditions in which the given body part received visuo-tactile stimulation and the conditions in which it did not (Hand: p\u00a0>\u00a00.5, Abdomen: p\u00a0>\u00a00.2, and Leg: p\u00a0>\u00a00.1). Finally, we detected significant positive correlations between the strength of the feeling of ownership (  Synch   minus   Asynch  ) of the stimulated body part and the strength of the feeling of ownership of the two non-stimulated body parts for all possible body part pairs (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05;  B). Thus, the strength of the subjective feeling of ownership of the body part that received the visuo-tactile stimuli significantly predicted the magnitude of the generalization of ownership to the two remaining body parts that did   not   receive the visuo-tactile stimuli. In summary, the feeling of ownership systematically generalized from the stimulated body part to body segments that did not receive visuo-tactile stimulation in a manner that was compatible with the emergence of a feeling of ownership of the entire body. \n\n#### Multivoxel patterns in the ventral premotor cortex generalize across all pairs of body parts \n  \nWe performed an fMRI experiment that extended a previously validated experimental paradigm based on virtual reality tools to induce the feeling of ownership of an entire body viewed from the first-person perspective ( ;  A). We searched for patterns of neural activity in the ventral premotor cortex that reflected the integration of congruent visual and tactile signals from one's body that were invariant with respect to the stimulated anatomical location. These activity patterns would be suggestive of the neural mechanisms that result in the construction of a whole-body multisensory percept. Thus, we trained linear classifiers to detect illusion-specific BOLD response patterns that generalize across all three pairs of stimulated body segments ( C; see   for details). A second-level random effect analysis of the pairwise decoding maps revealed that voxels in a region of the left ventral premotor cortex exhibited illusion-specific activation patterns that were invariant with respect to the stimulated body part (Hand\u00a0\u21d4\u00a0Abdomen, t\u00a0=\u00a06.89, p \u00a0=\u00a00.002, peak MNI coordinates [X\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a064, Y\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a03, Z\u00a0=\u00a027]; Hand\u00a0\u21d4\u00a0Leg, t\u00a0=\u00a04.70, p \u00a0=\u00a00.047, peak [X\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a064, Y\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a09, Z\u00a0=\u00a035]; and Abdomen\u00a0\u21d4\u00a0Leg, t\u00a0=\u00a04.91, p \u00a0=\u00a00.036, peak [X\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a064, Y\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a03, Z\u00a0=\u00a027];  A;  ). When considering the entire brain as a search space, no other region yielded decoding accuracies at the group level across all three body parts that survived the correction for multiple comparisons. Thus, the patterns of neural activity in the ventral premotor cortex reflected the integration of visual and tactile signals that were associated with the feeling of ownership over the entire body, regardless of the body segment that received the multisensory stimulation. Importantly, none of these illusion-specific activity patterns extended to the   Detached Hand   condition (no significant decoding at p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons in all pairwise maps;  A and B). This finding demonstrates that the generalization detected in the primary analysis described above was restricted to the context of an entire body, which is consistent with the notion that the visual impression of an entire body is a necessary factor for the generation of a whole-body percept. Furthermore, the failure to detect a significant difference between the   Synch   and   Asynch   activation patterns under the   Detached Hand   condition rules out a non-specific effect of the synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation mode. In summary, we generated evidence supporting the notion that neuronal populations in the ventral premotor cortex contain visuo-tactile receptive fields that encompass multiple body segments, which potentially mediate the construction of a multisensory whole-body percept. \n\n\n#### Multivoxel patterns in the ventral premotor cortex reflect a tripartite generalization across all three body segments \n  \nNext, we extended the pairwise decoding results described above. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that the activity patterns in the ventral premotor cortex generalize across all three body parts in a tripartite manner. Evidence for multivoxel patterns would be consistent with our hypothesis regarding the engagement of neuronal populations containing visuo-tactile receptive fields that are sufficiently large to encompass all body segments investigated, as opposed to only two of the three body parts tested, which could be the case for separated pairwise analyses alone. Thus, we trained linear classifiers on the illusion-specific activity patterns from two body parts and tested them on the illusion-specific patterns from the remaining body part ( C). Importantly, this analysis revealed that the voxels in the left ventral premotor cortex described above were associated with significant decoding accuracies, which supports a genuine generalization across all 3 body parts (Hand, Abdomen\u00a0\u21d2\u00a0Leg, t\u00a0=\u00a08.54, p \u00a0<\u00a00.001, peak [X\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a060, Y\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a03, Z\u00a0=\u00a033]; Hand, Leg\u00a0\u21d2\u00a0Abdomen, t\u00a0=\u00a06.84, p \u00a0=\u00a00.002, peak [X\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a060, Y\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a05, Z\u00a0=\u00a023]; and Abdomen, Leg\u00a0\u21d2\u00a0Hand, t\u00a0=\u00a05.93, p \u00a0=\u00a00.006, peak [X\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a064, Y\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a09, Z\u00a0=\u00a035];  C;  ). Thus, we speculate that these activity patterns originate from neuronal populations containing visuo-tactile receptive fields that are sufficiently large to encompass all 3 body parts. \n\n\n#### Body part-specific convergence of congruent visual and tactile signals \n  \nWe investigated the existence of neuronal populations containing visuo-tactile receptive fields that are restricted to a single body segment. Thus, we performed a new set of multivoxel analyses to detect patterns of brain activity associated with the integration of congruent visual and tactile signals from a single body segment. We found that activity patterns in several key multisensory regions distinguished between the stimulated body parts significantly better under the   Synch   condition than under the   Asynch   condition ( ). These activity patterns were localized to cortical regions that lined the junction of the right intraparietal and postcentral sulci (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011 corrected), the left dorsal premotor cortex (p\u00a0=\u00a00.037 corrected), the left lateral occipital cortex (p\u00a0=\u00a00.024 corrected), and the left putamen (p\u00a0=\u00a00.041 corrected;  B;  ). This finding was confirmed when we further examined the decoding maps for each potential \u201cpairwise\u201d comparison of the investigated body parts in a purely descriptive manner ( C). At a lower threshold, we observed the same results in the left postcentral gyrus, the posterior medial parietal cortex, and the right cerebellar cortex (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected for multiple comparisons;  ). In summary, multivoxel patterns of neural activity in crucial multisensory nodes across cortical and subcortical areas displayed response properties that are compatible with the integration of congruent visual and tactile signals from a specific body part and its immediately surrounding space. Thus, these results suggest the existence of neuronal populations that construct disjointed multisensory representations of individual body parts. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe employed a full-body perceptual illusion in conjunction with multivoxel pattern analysis of neuroimaging data to characterize the processes that support the feeling of ownership of an entire body. There were two important findings of the present study. First, we provided psychometric evidence for the generalization of ownership from one of three anatomically distant body parts (hand, abdomen, or leg) to the entire body. Second, multivoxel pattern analysis revealed a potential neural substrate for this whole-body percept. Specifically, we characterized the activity patterns in the ventral premotor cortex that generalized across three anatomically distant body parts, specifically in the context of full-body ownership. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the perception of one's body as a unified entity\u2014a whole-body percept\u2014is supported by neuronal populations containing visuo-somatic receptive fields that encompass multiple body segments. \n\n### A potential neurophysiological mechanism that contributes to the emergence of the whole-body percept \n  \nWe identified BOLD activity patterns in the left ventral premotor cortex that were associated with the integration of multisensory signals from one's own body. These activity patterns generalized across three different body segments, depended on the temporal congruence of the visuo-tactile signals, and were specific to the context of the visual integrity of the body (i.e., the observation of a whole body as opposed to a single detached limb). In light of these findings, we propose that a region of the premotor cortex encodes the occurrence of a multisensory event on the body in a manner that is specific to one's own body but is invariant with respect to the anatomical location from which the sensory signals originate. This finding extends beyond the previous study by Petkova et al., in which the investigation was limited to the multivoxel patterns that generalized between the abdomen and the hand ( ). Here, we demonstrated that this pairwise generalization was present for all pairs of body parts investigated (abdomen from/to hand, hand from/to leg, and leg from/to abdomen). Furthermore, we also generated evidence for multivoxel patterns that reflect the tripartite generalization of these body parts. This finding suggests that the human premotor cortex processes information that corresponds to the perception of ownership of the entire body. \n\nWhat are the neurophysiological underpinnings of these BOLD activity patterns? Electrophysiological recordings in non-human primates have characterized premotor neurons containing multisensory receptive fields that are sufficiently large to encompass multiple body segments or the entire body surface ( ). In light of their receptive field properties, these neuronal populations are ideally suited to combine visuo-tactile-proprioceptive signals across multiple body segments, in contrast to multisensory neurons that contain receptive fields that are restricted to individual body parts ( ). The present results suggest the existence of neuronal populations in the human ventral premotor cortex that contain multisensory receptive fields that are reminiscent of those characterized in non-human primates. We speculate that these neuronal populations are pivotal to the construction of a whole-body percept via the integration of multisensory information across multiple body segments. The activation of neurons containing such receptive fields would enable the synthesis of congruent multisensory information from several body segments, thereby facilitating the formation of a coherent representation of the entire body. \n\nConsistent with previous results ( ), the present findings shed light on the role of the left ventral premotor cortex in the feeling of ownership of one's own body. When the results of the multivoxel pattern analyses of interest across the entire brain were examined, only a region of the left ventral premotor cortex reached statistical significance following correction for multiple comparisons. When the results from the key multivoxel pattern analyses across the entire brain were examined using a lower statistical threshold (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected for multiple comparisons for each analysis of interest), no other brain region, with the exception of the left ventral premotor cortex, exhibited consistent results across all multivoxel analyses ( ). The left-sided localization of these multivoxel patterns differed from the bilateral premotor activations that were described in previous univariate fMRI experiments, which investigated variants of the rubber hand illusion induced on the right hand ( ; but see, for example,   for contralateral activations only) and the full-body illusion induced by stimulating a single right-sided body part (see experiments 1 and 2 in  ). However, the apparent anatomical lateralization of the multivoxel patterns to the left premotor cortex in the present full-body illusion experiments must be interpreted with caution because of the experimental design. In particular, the visuo-tactile stimuli were delivered exclusively to right-sided body parts (right hand, right upper leg, and right side of the abdomen; i.e., contralateral to the anatomical location of the left ventral premotor region of interest). The methodological selection of right-sided-only stimulation sites could potentially account for the anatomical lateralization of the multivoxel patterns to the left ventral premotor cortex. Notably, before any conclusions can be drawn regarding a potentially genuine hemispheric lateralization, future experiments must compare multivoxel patterns between the left and right premotor cortices using a paradigm in which the full-body illusion is elicited by stimulating both left- and right-sided body parts. Finally, it is likely that the neural and perceptual integration of multisensory signals across both sides of the body would engage additional inter-hemispheric mechanisms ( ) than those observed when exclusively examining left- or right-sided body parts. Future studies should shed light on this issue by investigating the neural and perceptual mechanisms underlying the integration of multisensory signals across both sides of one's own body and the associated functional role of the bilateral ventral premotor cortices. \n\n\n### From body part-specific to whole-body multisensory representations \n  \nOur neuroimaging results indicate the co-existence of multisensory representations of restricted body segments alongside representations of substantially larger portions of the body (or the entire body). We suggest that this finding reflects the diversity of multisensory receptive fields, which range from body-part-specific, to specific to large segments of the body and the entire body. A recurring characteristic of the organization of sensory systems is the hierarchical arrangement of neuronal receptive fields, which range from small and simple to large and complex, that is typical of both the visual ( ) and somatosensory ( ) systems. An extensive collection of neurophysiological and neuroimaging research in monkeys and humans has characterized the convergence of multisensory signals in higher-order cortical and subcortical brain regions ( ). These regions are characterized by receptive fields that are typically larger and more complex than those in early sensory cortices ( ), facilitating the convergence of spatio-temporally aligned multisensory inputs ( ). \n\nIn human neuroimaging, most of the available evidence relates to the representation of individual body parts, such as the upper limb ( ) or the face ( ). The convergence of multisensory signals from these body parts has been associated with regions of the parietal and premotor cortices, as well as the putamen, which is consistent with the present findings of body part-specific activity patterns in these areas. Furthermore, a region of the lateral occipital cortex has been shown to contain a topographical representation of individual body segments that receives converging input regarding touch, vision, and proprioception ( ). Although the present study was not designed to obtain a multisensory topographical map of the different body segments ( ), our results support the convergence of spatio-temporally congruent visual and somatosensory signals onto disjointed multisensory representations of individual body parts. These representations are pivotal for manifold functions, such as the ability to interact with objects in the external environment ( ), defend the body from potential threats ( ), and mediate the self-attribution of individual body segments ( ). \n\nIn contrast to the representation of individual body parts, the evidence supporting multisensory representations of the entire body is scarce. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to provide evidence for the convergence of visuo-tactile signals across multiple body segments in the human association cortex. As indicated above, the interpretation of this finding with respect to the existence of neuronal populations containing multisensory receptive fields that encompass a large portion of the body is compatible with neurophysiological data ( ). Furthermore, the illusion-specificity of the premotor activity patterns that generalize across the three investigated anatomically distant body parts provides new evidence for the contribution of this region to the construction of a multisensory percept of one's entire body. Future studies should investigate the interaction between the unified representation of multiple body segments in the premotor cortex, the encoding of one's body orientation in the gravitational field, which is thought to involve the temporo-parietal junction ( ), and allocentric representations of bodily self-location, which speculatively involve the medial temporal and posterior parietal cortices (  Decoding illusory out-of-body experiences. Society for Neuroscience: conference abstract). Finally, we note that the co-existence of body part-specific and whole-body representations is relevant to behaviors that rely on the coordination of multiple body segments. The maintenance of updated representations of both individual body segments and large portions of the body likely facilitates the coordination of complex, goal-directed and defensive actions ( ). \n\n\n### Behavioral evidence for the emergence of the multisensory whole-body percept \n  \nImportantly, the results from the neuroimaging experiment are consistent with those obtained from the behavioral experiment. Because the behavioral and neuroimaging data were obtained from two separate experiments in two different groups of participants, we could not perform direct correlation analyses to investigate the potential systematic relationships between the information content in the multivoxel patterns and the subjective reports of the perception of full-body ownership. Nevertheless, both experiments contribute valuable novel results that are consistent with our a priori hypothesis. In particular, the subjective reports suggest that the feeling of ownership is not restricted to the body part that receives the multisensory stimuli, but rather is systematically generalized to encompass the entire body. In an extension of previous studies that interpreted physiological responses, such as threat-evoked skin conductance responses ( ) or temperature variations ( ), as indirect proxies of whole-body percepts, here, we provide direct psychometric evidence for the generalization of ownership across the entire body. In particular, we demonstrated that the subjectively rated ownership of the stimulated body part predicts the strength of ownership of the two   non  -stimulated body parts. Importantly, this result is difficult to explain solely in terms of inter-individual differences in the perceptual traits associated with the ability to integrate visual and tactile signals, which could lead to similarly vivid feelings of ownership for the different body parts that receive visuo-tactile stimuli. Consistent with the neuroimaging data described above, the present behavioral findings provide insights into the multisensory processes that underlie the perception of an entire body viewed from the first-person perspective as one's own ( ), and, broadly speaking, emphasize the importance of cross-modal cues for bodily self-consciousness ( ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nConverging psychometric and neuroimaging results suggests that the integration of multisensory information across multiple body segments contributes to the emergence of the perception of ownership of an entire artificial body. Furthermore, this percept corresponds to specific activity patterns in the ventral premotor cortex. These findings support the existence of specific cortical mechanisms underlying the emergence of a unified percept of one's own entire body. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: t0005\n### Label:

All subjects underwent resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). We constructed the sFC and dFC of the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using a sliding-window approach, and the correlations between the changed sFC or dFC and cognitive performance were analyzed. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWhole-brain sFC analysis showed that the lung cancer patients showed significant FC pattern changes in the bilateral DLPFC, mainly in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), bilateral middle frontal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobe and the right insula. Furthermore, after chemotherapy, the lung cancer patients showed significantly reduced dFC variability between the right DLPFC and right precuneus compared with HCs. In addition, the decreased dFC between the right DLPFC and left SFG in the lung cancer patients after chemotherapy in state 1 and between the right DLPFC and left insula in the lung cancer patients before chemotherapy in state 2 were negatively correlated with MoCA scores ((r = -0.520,   p  \u2009=\u20090.039; r = -0.548,   p  \u2009=\u20090.028, respectively). \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur results reveal that dynamic connectivity analysis is more effective and sensitive than methods that assume static brain states for linking brain FC patterns and chemotherapy. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAccompanying the increasing morbidity (ranking first among globally diagnosed cancers (Bray et al.  )) and overall survival rate of lung cancer, chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) in lung cancer has become a well-recognized side effect during and after adjuvant chemotherapy treatment (Janelsins et al.  ). Platinum-based chemotherapy was a broadly used global standard of care for advanced lung cancer(Ettinger et al.  ; Scagliotti et al.  ). Kaasa et al. ( ) indicated that non-small cell lung cancer patients exhibited cognitive deficits as soon as one month after adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Longitudinal neuropsychological assessment research studies (Janelsins et al.  ) suggest that up to 75% of cancer patients experience multiple-domain CRCI, particularly impairments in executive functions, attention, memory and processing speed, during treatment and up to 35% experience persistent CRCI for months or years following treatment completion (Grosshans et al.  ; Janelsins et al.  ; Li and Caeyenberghs  ; Mandelblatt et al.  ; Pergolizzi et al.  ). As a major component of advanced cognitive functions, executive functions are vital to human autonomy and are a major determinant of problem behaviors and disabilities (Royall et al.  ) that incorporate and command more basic cognitive processes (Baddeley  ; Funahashi and Andreau  ; Jodzio and Biechowska  ). Improving our understanding of the changes that occur in executive function-related neurological mechanisms in lung cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy might be conducive to adjusting treatment regimens appropriately and achieving better functional improvements. \n\nRemarkably, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has been proved as a powerful noninvasive method for examining the brain functional network. rs-fMRI evaluates the temporal correlation of intrinsic low-frequency fluctuations based on blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals between brain regions during rest(Rosazza and Minati  ). In practice, using this technique, functional connectivity studies have reported a number of resting-state networks (RSNs) that consist of anatomically separated, but functionally connected regions displaying a high level of correlated BOLD signal activity(van den Heuvel et al.  ; Van Dijk et al.  ), and the corroborated executive control network (ECN) mainly involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) (Bressler and Menon  ; Shirer et al.  ; Weiland et al.  ). Recently, a neuroimaging community report showing the altered FC of the ECN in cancer patients during and after chemotherapy has gained increasing attention. Piccirillo et al. (Piccirillo et al.  ) focused on the FC changes in the frontoparietal network and the cingulo-opercular executive control network in breast cancer patients using a case-control design. Their findings indicated that the standard therapeutic levels of chemotherapy in breast cancer resulted in disrupted FC in the brain networks supporting attention and executive control function. Furthermore, Shelli and colleagues (Kesler et al.  ) examined differences in prefrontal regions between breast cancer patients received chemotherapy or not and healthy controls. The findings demonstrated hypoactivation in the left medial dorsolateral prefrontal lobe and premotor cortex in breast cancer patients received chemotherapy compared with the healthy controls. \n\nNevertheless, the aforementioned studies on the FC patterns of the ECN in cancer patients after chemotherapy assumed that FC was stationary during the process of scanning, which is referred to as static FC (sFC). Studies have displayed that the resting brain is an extremely dynamic system and that the functional connectivity states of human brain vary over time (Allen et al.  ; Hutchison et al.  ). Thus, the sFC approach has distinct limitations in reflecting dynamic brain processes. Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis overcomes this static restriction and can reflect the time-varying patterns and temporal dynamic characteristics of FC (Hutchison et al.  ). Studies have shown that dFC analysis produces more sensitive results than sFC analysis for identifying group differences between healthy controls and patients with various neurological diseases (Chen et al.  ; Fu et al.  ; Yang et al.  ). Notably, a previous study (Kesler et al.  ) demonstrated that functional dynamics were distinctly lower in breast cancer patients than in control participants. \n\nPrevious studies on CRCI in lung cancer have mainly concentrated on brain structure changes and default mode network disruption (Bromis et al.  ; Simo et al.  ,  ,  ; Welzel et al.  ). Bromis et al. ( ) found significant FC disruptions within all the rest-state networks of lung cancer patients after chemotherapy compared with the healthy controls. Additionally, other results suggest that the reduced rest-state FC pattern within the default mode network (DMN) and the cognitive disorder were associated with cancer and chemotherapy in lung cancer patients (Simo et al.  ; Zhang et al.  ). Unfortunately, executive function disorders related to cancer and chemotherapy in the lung cancer patient population remain poorly understood, and further explorations are urgently necessary. \n\nThe present study aimed to investigate cancer- and chemotherapy-related intrinsic sFC and dFC differences within the ECN in rs-fMRI employing the seed-based approach in lung cancer survivors. The prefrontal cortex has been demonstrated to be an important structure for executive functions(Funahashi and Andreau  ). Moreover, the DLPFC, in the middle frontal gyrus, which is the core node of the ECN, is involved in functions including working memory, prospective memory and executive function (Mitchell et al.  ; Pochon et al.  ). Based on previous neuroimaging findings, we selected the bilateral DLPFC as the critical seed region and hypothesized that (1) sFC and dFC patterns in the DLPFC are significantly functionally disrupted in lung cancer patients after chemotherapy and (2) that altered sFC or dFC was associated with cognitive performance in lung cancer patients. As far as we know, this is the first longitudinal study to explore links between sFC and dFC changes in ECN patterns and chemotherapy in the lung cancer patient population. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe prospective study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Nanjing Medical University, and all subjects signed informed consent before their participation in the study protocol. \n\nThis was a longitudinal study of lung cancer patients scheduled to incorporate scans at baseline (t0) and three to six months (t1) after receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and to include age/sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Eighteen lung cancer patients from the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Nanjing First Hospital and 21 healthy controls (aged between 48 and 70 years, received at least 6 years of education) were enrolled through online advertisements and age, sex, and education level-matched between May 2018 and August 2019. All participants were right-handed. Among the patients treated with chemotherapy (platinum-based doublet with pemetrexed), 10 patients received cisplatin-based therapy, and 8 patients received carboplatin-based therapy for three to six months. No participants were excluded from the fMRI analysis because of excessive head motion during scanning. The exclusion criteria for all participants were: receipt prophylactic cranial irradiation; presence of a metastatic brain tumor; declared history of known stroke, craniocerebral trauma, epilepsy, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, other acute psychiatric or neurological illnesses; presence of a major medical illness (e.g., anemia, severe heart diseases, thyroid dysfunction or abnormality in liver or kidney function); and presence of severe vision or hearing loss. The neuropsychological status and general cognitive function of the participants were established using the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) (Galea and Woodward  ) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (Nasreddine et al.  ). \n\n\n### MRI acquisition \n  \nAll MRI data were acquired in 3.0 T MRI scanner (Ingenia, Philips Medical Systems, Netherlands) with an 8-channel receiver array head coil and parallel imaging was employed. Tight but comfortable foam padding was used to minimize head motion, and earplugs were used to alleviate scanner noise. Subjects were instructed to lie with their eyes closed and stay awake, to not thinking things in particular. For each participant, routine MRI sequences, including thick-slice T2- and T1-weighted imaging as well as T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, were performed to ensure that there were no visible brain lesions or brain metastases. \n\nThe resting state fMRI data were obtained with the gradient echo-planar imaging sequence as follows: repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20092000 ms; echo time (TE)\u2009=\u200930 ms; slices\u2009=\u200936; thickness\u2009=\u20094 mm; gap\u2009=\u20090 mm; field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009240 mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009240 mm; acquisition matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964; and flip angle (FA)\u2009=\u200990\u00b0. High-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted images (3D-T1WI) data were acquired with magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence as follows: TR\u2009=\u20098.1 ms; TE\u2009=\u20093.7 ms; slices\u2009=\u2009170; thickness\u2009=\u20091 mm; gap\u2009=\u20090 mm; FA\u2009=\u20098\u00b0; acquisition matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256; and FOV\u2009=\u2009256 mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 mm. The resting state fMRI sequence lasted 488 s, and the structural sequence lasted 329 s. \n\n\n### Data preprocessing \n  \nFunctional preprocessing was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8;  ) and the Graph Theoretical Network Analysis Toolbox for Imaging Connectomics (GRETNA) (Wang et al.  ) (2.0.0A  ). The processing pipeline included the following stages: (i) The first 10 volumes were discarded to calculate the time required for participants to adapt to the scanning environment. (ii) Slice timing corrected and realigned were performed for the remaining 220 images, and head motion\u2009>\u20092.0-mm in each direction or rotation angle\u2009>\u20092.0\u00b0 were removed from analysis. (iii) The remaining dataset was normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) EPI template (reslicing voxel size as 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093 mm ). (iv) Spatially smoothing with a Gaussian kernel [6 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM)]. (v) Detrending and filtering (0.01\u20130.08 Hz) were performed in turn. Subsequently, several nuisance signals including head motion, the global mean, and signals from white matter (WM) and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were regressed from the data. \n\n\n### Static FC analysis \n  \nThe seed regions in the bilateral DLPFC were extracted from the Brodmann template using WFU Pick Atlas software (Maldjian et al.  ). For sFC analysis, the mean time series of the signal in the bilateral DLPFC were obtained to serve as the seed time course, and the Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were finally calculated between the mean time series of each seed region and all brain voxel time series. Finally, a Fisher\u2019s z-transform was used to obtain variables approximating a normal distribution (Lowe et al.  ). \n\n\n### Dynamic FC analysis \n  \nDynamic FC analysis was performed using the Dynamic Brain Connectome (Dynamic BC) toolbox (Liao et al.  ) (V2.1  ). Temporal dynamic patterns were characterized by using a sliding-window approach, which was created by convolving a rectangle with a Gaussian kernel (\u03c3\u2009=\u20093TRs). Previous studies have revealed that a frequency interval of [0\u2009\u2212\u20091/w] Hz should be the target due to the low-pass filtering effect of the window and that the minimum window length should be above 1/f  (Leonardi and Van De Ville  ). Some researchers have applied a sliding-window length of as small as 10 s (Thompson et al.  ) and as long as 180 s (Gonzalez-Castillo et al.  ). Thus, the window size was chosen to be 20 TRs (40 s), and the window overlap was selected to be 95% (window-shifting step size of 1 TR), resulting in W\u2009=\u2009201 windows (Chen et al.  ). The temporal correlation coefficient between the time courses of each seed and that for the other brain voxels was calculated for each sliding window. For each subject, a range of sliding-window correlation maps was acquired. To characterize the time variability in FC, the standard deviation of each voxel across a number of windows was calculated and the Fisher Z-transformed used to acquire variables similar to a normal distribution (Liao et al.  ). \n\n\n### Clustering analysis \n  \nTo assess reoccurring dFC patterns, a k-means clustering algorithm was used to analyze dFC estimates of all subjects (combining the lung cancer and HC groups) (Allen et al.  ). We used the L1 distance function to assess the similarity between sliding window FCs, as L1 distance has been proved to be an effective measurement method for high-dimensional data (Aggarwal et al.  ; Allen et al.  ). We determined the number of clusters to be three using the elbow criterion of the cluster validity index, which is computed as the ratio between the within-cluster distance and between-cluster distance. The gained clustering centroids were then served as the departure points to cluster all dFC windows from all subjects. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nSPSS software (version 19.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analyses, and a corrected statistically significance level of p\u2009<\u20090.05 was obtained. Group comparisons of demographic information or clinical measures were performed using two-sample t-tests to compare continuous data between the lung cancer groups and HC group. \n\nA one-sample t-test was performed to analyze individual sFC maps in a voxel wise manner. The test was used to determine the sFC patterns in regions with significant connectivity to the specific seeds in each group. Two-sample t-tests were then performed to determine the sFC and dFC differences between HCs and lung cancer patients at t0 and t1, and paired t-tests were used to estimate the sFC and dFC differences between t0 and t1 in the lung cancer patients. Correction was implemented using false discovery rate (FDR) approach and significance threshold was set at p\u2009<\u20090.01. Age, sex and education were used as nuisance covariates to control for the effects of these factors on the results. \n\nIn order to study the temporal properties of dFC patterns, we calculated some dynamic indicators including the mean dwell time (MDT) and the number of transitions (NT). The average time (in windows) spent in a state before transitioning to another state was defined as the MDT. In addition, the NT stands for the number of transitions between states. Group differences tests in the MDT and NT between HCs and lung cancer patients at t0 and t1were checked using a two-sample t-test (P\u2009<\u20090.01, FDR correction). Between-group differences among the lung cancer patients at t0 and t1 were investigated using paired t-tests (P\u2009<\u20090.01, FDR correction). \n\nTo evaluate the correlational relationship of abnormal sFC or dFC and cognitive performance, Pearson correlation analyses were implemented by using SPSS19.0. P less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Partial correlations were calculated after correcting for age, sex and education. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and neuropsychological data \n  \nAll the detailed demographics and a summary of the histological diagnosis and tumor stage are included in Table  . There was no significant difference in age, sex, education level, or MMSE score between the lung cancer patients and the HCs (all p\u2009>\u20090.05). The lung cancer patient group at t1 had worse MoCA scores than the HC group and lung cancer patient group at t0 (p\u2009<\u20090.001).   \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of all subjects \n  \nData are expressed as Mean\u00b1SD, n (%) or median (range),  The P values are obtained by using two sample t-test;  The P values are obtained by using \u03c72 test.

Moreover, in state 2, compared with that in the HCs, the decreased dFC of the right DLPFC to the left insula in the lung cancer group at t0 was negatively associated with reduced MoCA scores (r=-0.548,   p  \u2009=\u20090.028) (Fig.  B). \n\n  \n A   Negative correlation between the decreased dFC between the right DLPFC and left SFG and MoCA scores in patients after chemotherapy compared with nonchemotherapy patients (r = -0.520, p\u2009=\u20090.039).

Indeed, research on rest-state sFC changes related to chemotherapy has witnessed exponential growth. In the current study, we found that the regions interacting with the bilateral DLPFC were mainly distributed in the PFC, partial parietal and temporal lobe. The DLPFC, which is the core node of the ECN, is involved in functions including working memory, prospective memory and executive function (Barbey et al.  ; Pochon et al.  ). The PFC and its cortical and subcortical connections play a central role in processing executive functions (Rusnakova et al.  ). In addition, the STG is considered to be a central brain region involved in processing executive functions together with frontal areas that form a cognitive network (Bockova et al.  ). Recent studies have demonstrated that the PFC and STG are impaired in lung cancer patients after chemotherapy (McDonald et al.  ; Simo et al.  ; Wang et al.  ). In breast cancer patients, reduced FC was chiefly seen between the right DLPFC and the right IFG, right MFG, and left STG compared with HCs (Wang et al. ). One month after standard chemotherapy, McDonald et al. (McDonald et al. ) reported that both patients receiving chemotherapy and those not requiring chemotherapy showed decreased activation of the IFG compared to HCs. Our findings are not only consistent with literature reports but are also unique. Our findings support the idea that the cancer disease process itself affects brain functioning (Menning et al.  ); in addition, by means of longitudinal comparison, we confirmed the exact effect of chemotherapy on sFC. \n\nFurthermore, the decreased sFC between the bilateral DLPFC and the left IPL was demonstrated in prechemotherapy lung cancer patients compared with HCs. Sanne et al. (Menning et al.  ) detected that parietal activation decreased in a breast cancer group that was not exposed to any systemic treatment compared to an HC group. Based on previous studies, we speculated that the parietal areas are more susceptible to factors related to stressful events, such as cancer diagnosis and surgery. In contrast, the lung cancer group showed significantly increased sFC between the left DLPFC and right insula after chemotherapy. The insula is believed to be involved in emotion and consciousness. A previous study (Feng et al.  ) reported that patients treated with chemotherapy showed persistent anxiety and depression symptoms over time and that psychological symptom score changes were significantly positively associated with FC changes between the left hippocampus and left insula. We hypothesized that the increased sFC between the left DLPFC and right insula may be a mechanism of self-regulating negative emotion in lung cancer patients. \n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated altered brain sFC patterns in the ECN induced by cancer and chemotherapy. Recent evidence has shown that exploiting the dynamic properties of FC instead of traditional sFC metrics can open up novel thinking for interpreting brain functioning on different timescales (Liegeois et al.  ). Shelli R. Kesler and his colleagues (Kesler et al.  ) demonstrated that functional dynamics were significantly lower in patients with breast cancer than in control participants. In this study, dFC provided additional information that was different from but complementary to the information for sFC. We found significantly decreased dFC variability between the bilateral DLPFC and right SPL and left SFG in lung cancer patients after chemotherapy and significantly reduced dFC between the bilateral DLPFC and left precuneus and ITG when comparing before and after chemotherapy. As mentioned above, the dFC variability changes after chemotherapy were consistent with the sFC changes. \n\nInterestingly, we found some significant brain FC patterns that were related to chemotherapy only when using dFC analysis, while sFC analysis did not reveal any significant correlations. For example, increased dFC variability between the bilateral DLPFC and left precuneus was observed before chemotherapy, and decreased dFC between the right DLPFC and left precuneus was found after chemotherapy. The precuneus, which is part of the posteromedial parietal lobe, is involved in attentive tracking, visuospatial imagination, and spatially guided behaviors (Cavanna and Trimble  ). Simo et al. ( ) revealed that lung cancer patients after chemotherapy showed decreased FC in the left cuneus and precuneus compared to HCs. Additionally, Wang et al. ( ) found increased sFC between the right DLPFC and the right precuneus after chemotherapy. We hypothesize that dFC analysis seems to capture more complex FC changes than sFC, which is also supported by the links that have been drawn between FC and the underlying brain structural connectivity. \n\nIn addition, after clustering analysis, we found that the dFC patterns were completely different under various connectivity states and increased dFC was even found in some states after chemotherapy. For example, in state 3, dFC was significantly increased between the left DLPFC and right MCG. However, we could not discover these FC pattern changes during sFC analysis. Fiorenzato et al. (Fiorenzato et al.  ) also revealed two entirely different connectivity states in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients. The cingulate cortex is usually perceived to be part of the limbic cortex, which lies immediately above the corpus callosum, and the MCG has been termed the cingulate motor area and can be activated by pain and errors made in many tasks (Kolling et al.  ; Rolls  ). Our results demonstrated that dFC analysis could capture new and latent changes in FC and that these changes were possibly derived from the dynamics of connectivity states. Even more importantly, these aforementioned findings provide evidence of increased MCG activity in lung cancer patients and allow us to speculate that this activity is a kind of compensatory mechanism in the brain activated when responding to cancer and chemotherapy. \n\nMoreover, significant between-group differences in the temporal properties of dFC states were recognized in several states. Our results showed that lung cancer patients after chemotherapy tended to have a shortened MDT in certain states and a reduced NT between states, which have not been mentioned in previous studies. However, Fiorenzato et al. (Fiorenzato et al.  ) found that an extended MDT in the segregated state and a reduced NT between states in Parkinson\u2019s disease. Moreover, as we all know that the lung cancer patients are generally treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, which is related to increased cell death and decreased cell division in the central nervous system (Dietrich et al.  ). Therefore, the destruction of neural structures in lung cancer patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy is likely a reason for the decreases in the MDT and NT. Thus, we may reasonably conjecture that the MDT and NT could be reference indexes to assess the effects of chemotherapy on human-brain FC pattern. Hence, more comprehensive forward-looking studies are desperately needed to explore whether the MDT and NT can be appropriate potential biomarkers of cognitive impairment in lung cancer patients. \n\nIn this study, the MoCA scores of lung cancer patients after chemotherapy were dramatically reduced. Concerning the correlations between the FC and MoCA scores, we found no significant correlations between MoCA scores and sFC, while negative correlations between MoCA scores and altered dFC were observed in some brain regions. Static measures of FC, which provide a measure of brain function averaged over several minutes, are oversimplified, and dynamic FC measures that capture temporal changes in brain function on the order of a few seconds have been proposed. Therefore, we judged that dFC could capture more information and was more sensitive for assessing brain function and cognitive defects in lung cancer patients after chemotherapy than sFC. \n\nThere were a few limitations in this study. First, the relatively small sample size might reduce the generalizability of our results to some extent. Second, although the present study employed a longitudinal experimental design, follow-up data were collected only for patients in the lung cancer group and not for healthy controls. Previous studies (Feng et al.  ; Pergolizzi et al.  ) have provided evidence that cancer patients after chemotherapy exhibit FC changes during short-term follow-up (3\u20136 months) and have no significant difference in healthy controls. Nevertheless, all enrolled subjects should be strictly followed in subsequent longitudinal studies. Finally, we selected the bilateral DLPFC as the seed regions to investigate the sFC and dFC patterns in the ECN after chemotherapy and explore the correlational relationships with MoCA scores. The MoCA is a brief cognitive screening tool that is not very sensitive to certain domains, such as executive functions and memory, which have been exposed to be damaged after chemotherapy in previous studies. Thus, a more sophisticated and niche-targeted cognitive evaluation should be performed in future studies. \n\nIn conclusion, this is the first study to explore the sFC and dFC variations within the ECN and the relationships between the aberrant FC and cognitive decline in lung cancer patients before and after chemotherapy. Despite the limitations of the present study, our results revealed that using a dynamic connectivity analysis was more effective and sensitive for linking brain FC patterns and chemotherapy than methods that assume static brain states. The most important implication from our study is to bring awareness to cancer clinicians so they can provide information on expected CRCI to cancer patients. Moreover, several treatments are underway to help combat the symptoms of chemobrain. We concluded that the temporal dynamics of FC could be a potential biomarker to detect cognitive alterations in lung cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and provide a solid evidence for multidisciplinary rehabilitation prevention and treatment of chemobrain. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tLung cancer (n\u2009=\u200918)\tLung cancer (n\u2009=\u200918).1\tHCs (n\u2009=\u200921)\tp value\nAge, year\t59.72\u2009\u00b1\u20099.04\t59.72\u2009\u00b1\u20099.04\t58.57\u2009\u00b1\u20099.61\t0.703a\nEducation, year\t10.59\u2009\u00b1\u20094.25\t10.59\u2009\u00b1\u20094.25\t10.71\u2009\u00b1\u20091.88\t0.904a\nGender, male/female\t13/5\t13/5\t13/8\t0.828b\nHistological diagnosis\tHistological diagnosis\tHistological diagnosis\tHistological diagnosis\tHistological diagnosis\nAdenocarcinoma\t9(50)\t9(50)\t\t\nSquamous cell carcinoma\t7 (39)\t7 (39)\t\t\nSCLC\t2 (11)\t2 (11)\t\t\nTumor stage\tTumor stage\tTumor stage\tTumor stage\tTumor stage\nLimited disease\t1 (5)\t1 (5)\t\t\nExtensive disease\t1 (5)\t1 (5)\t\t\nI\t3 (17)\t3 (17)\t\t\nII\t5(28)\t5(28)\t\t\nIII\t4 (22)\t4 (22)\t\t\nIV\t4 (22)\t4 (22)\t\t\n\tt0\tt1\t\t\nMMSE\t26.78\u2009\u00b1\u20091.17\t26.61\u2009\u00b1\u20091.19\t27.19\u2009\u00b1\u20091.03\t0.248a1;0.163a2;0.698a3\nMoCA\t22.22\u2009\u00b1\u20091.93\t22.06\u2009\u00b1\u20092.94\t25.76\u2009\u00b1\u20091.61\t0.000*a1; 0.000*a2;0.817a3\n### Caption\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of all subjects\n### Footer\nData are expressed as Mean\u00b1SD, n (%) or median (range), aThe P values are obtained by using two sample t-test; bThe P values are obtained by using \u03c72 test. *P<0.05 is considered significant. a1 The P value between lung cancer patients before chemotherapy and HCs;a2 The P value between lung cancer patients after chemotherapy and HCs;a3 The P value between lung cancer patients before and after chemotherapy.

However, because of the lack of objective cognitive tests, inconsistencies in research results, and improvement in patients' subjective experience, few clinicians are concerned with the persistent impairment of EF in euthymia. The study makes a further investigation for EF in remitted and partially remitted MDD patients   via   multiple EF tests and fMRI, so as to explore the executive function of patients in euthymia. \n\n Methods:   We recruited 19 MDD patients and 17 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls (HCs). All participants completed EF tests and fMRI scanning. Bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) regions were selected as the region of interests (ROIs) to conduct seed-based functional connectivity (FC). We conducted fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) analysis for all ROIs and whole brain. \n\n Results:   All MDD patients were in remission or partial remission, and they were comparable with HCs on all the EF tests. MDD group showed increased positive FC between left dlPFC and cerebellar Crus I, right dlPFC and supramarginal gyrus after 8-weeks treatment, even taking residual depressive symptoms into account. We did not find group difference of fALFF value. \n\n Conclusion:   MDD patients persisted with EF impairment despite the remission or partially remission of depressive symptoms. Clinicians should focus on residual cognitive symptoms, which may contribute to maximize the efficacy of routine therapy. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a major contributor of global burden of diseases ( ), in which cognition deficits is a core symptom ( ). Research has identified that patients with MDD have a broad range of cognition impairments, which still exists even after the remission of clinical symptoms ( ), particularly the impairment of executive function (EF) ( \u2013 ). EF is involved in the generation and maintenance of goal-directed behavior by planning, decision making, inhibition control, etc ( ). Varieties of cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving, depend heavily on different dimensions of EF ( ). Increasing evidences have indicated that impaired EF, particularly inhibition as the key component, is associated with a series of typical depressive characteristics: rumination ( ,  ), negative attentional bias ( ), emotion regulation dysfunction ( ), etc. Likewise, impaired EF is closely related to psychosocial dysfunction in multiple domains such as occupational function, which contribute to huge social cost ( ,  ). Furthermore, EF is an available predictor for treatment outcomes ( ). Therefore, it is necessary to focus on and treat impaired EF for MDD patients. However, published literature have not come to an agreement on whether or not current antidepressant could improve EF. \n\nSome behavior-level studies suggest that antidepressant could improve the impaired EF of MDD patients ( ,  ). On the contrary, recent meta-analysis indicated that EF impairment persisted despite a clinical remission ( ,  ). However, it is insufficient and difficult to illustrate the effect of antidepressant on EF only   via   behavior tests considered the fact that some fMRI studies recorded the abnormal neural activity in MDD patients in the case of their cognitive performance comparable to healthy controls ( ,  ). Researchers explain the phenomenon as neurocompensatory effects ( ,  ): behavioral performance of psychiatric patients could achieve the same level as healthy controls (HC) by increasing activity of neural underpinnings of cognition. But some researchers reported abnormal neural activity concurrent with behavioral impairment in patients with mental disorders ( ,  ), which suggests that the range of neurocompensatory processes is limited and it is also a representation of EF impairment. Therefore, it is necessary to address the neural activity associated with EF besides cognition tests when assessing the improvement of EF after treatment. However, the results of fMRI studies are inconsistent. Wagner et al. found that antidepressant normalized abnormal activation associated with EF ( ). Smith et al. showed that remitted MDD patients were comparable to healthy controls on EF tests and neural activity underlying EF ( ). Bartova et al. showed reduced deactivation of default mode network (DMN) during working memory tasks and increased connectivity between DMN and salience network (SN) in remitted MDD patients ( ). Importantly, however, the fMRI studies we demonstrated above measured EF through single task. EF is a complex construct which includes at least shifting, inhibition, working memory, updating, verbal fluency, and planning ( ). One-sided assessment influences the location and direction of activation difference, and limits our holistic understanding of the effect of antidepressant on EF. Furthermore, any of mental functions, especially those advanced mental functions like EF, is carried out by network consisting of multiple synergistic brain regions. Whereas, we know little about the functional connectivity (FC) within network underlying EF in remitted MDD patients. Thus, we aimed to make a further investigation to better characterize the nature of neural basis of EF in remitted MDD patients. \n\nDorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) plays an important role in EF. Previous studies have shown that functional impairment of dlPFC in MDD patients is closely related to cognitive dysfunction ( ). Synder reviewed that dlPFC is involved in each domain of EF ( ). Furthermore, dlPFC is also a key node of frontoparietal network (FPN) proposed by Dosenbach et al. ( ). According to Dosenbach, FPN occupies in top-down control and provides rapid control initiation and adjustment signals for other brain networks, in which dlPFC exerts adjust control through carrying error-related activity. The main purpose of present study is using fMRI, a powerful non-invasive neuroimaging technique to explore the FC within dlPFC-based EF network during resting state combined with multiple EF tests in remitted MDD patients. Previous fMRI studies have provided rich evidence that emotional, cognitive, and behavioral impairments in depression are associated with functional abnormalities in specific regions and connections ( ). Based on this, we evaluated the activity intensity of dlPFC as well. We hypothesized that MDD patients persist altered FC and/or activity in neural basis underlying EF despite the remission of depressive symptoms. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe recruited MDD patients from the out-patient and in-patient in the Department of Psychiatry, First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University. MDD diagnosis was determined by two practiced psychiatrists according to the diagnose criteria of MDD in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Further inclusive criteria for MDD patients: (1) total score on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) \u2265 17; (2) aged between 18 and 55 years. The exclusion criteria include: (1) left-handedness; (2) comorbidity with or a history of other DSM-IV Axis I disorders; (3) contraindication of MRI scanning; (4) history of neurological diseases, severe medical illness, etc. All participants take fluoxetine at a dose 20 mg\u221240 mg/d for 8 weeks. We assessed the clinical characteristics of patients again after treatment. Only those patients who completed all tests we need both at pretreatment (week 0) and posttreatment (week 8) were included. In addition, one participant was excluded due to excessive head motion (exceed 2.5 mm or 2.5\u00b0 in any direction or angular). Finally, 19 patients were included in our analysis. \n\nWe also enrolled 17 healthy controls (HCs) well-matched with MDD patients in age (18\u201355), gender and years of education. HC did not meet any criteria of Axis I disorders and personality disorders, and the score of HAMD-17 is <7. Additional exclusion criteria include: (1) left-handedness; (2) contraindication of MRI scanning; (3) history of neurological diseases, severe medical illness, etc. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University. All participants signed the informed consent. \n\n\n### Assessment \n  \n#### HAMD-17 \n  \nThe scale is a most commonly used tool to quantify the severity of depressive symptoms of patients in the last week. In the study, HAMD-17 was administered by consultant psychiatrists. \n\n\n#### Executive Functions \n  \nWe assessed EF by the following tests: Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT; for inhibition), Digital Span Tests (DST; for working memory), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST; for shifting), and Semantic Verbal Fluency Test (SVFT; for verbal fluency). SCWT consists of three 30-items subtests: word task (reading words of color), color task (naming color of color circles), and color-word task (identifying the color ink of printed color words). Relative reaction time (RRT; the difference reaction time between color-word condition and color-naming condition) and accuracy in color-word condition reflect the ability of inhibition. DST asks participants to repeat the numbers in the same (Forward DST) and reverse order (Backward DST) as presented. The sequence length will increase if participants give the correct order, or we'll present another sequence of numbers. The test will finish when participants failed twice. Total length of sequence given correct answer reflects the working memory span. WCST asks subjects to sort cards to specific dimension according to feedback. If correct matches achieve a fixed number, the classification rules will change. We evaluate shifting ability by response administered (RA), categories completed (CC), correct response (RC), errors response (RE), perseverative errors (PE), and non-perseverative errors (nPE). In SVFT, participants need to say as many as they can in 1 min from certain semantic categories (fruits and vegetables). Total number of fruits and vegetables they say within a given time represent the ability of verbal fluency. All of the tests were administered by senior psychologists. \n\n\n\n### Image Analysis \n  \n#### Acquisition \n  \nImage was performed by a Simens TrioTim 3.0T scanner with 12-channel birdcage head coil at the Shanxi Provincial People's Hospital. T1-weight anatomical images was used to acquire anatomical MRI data with following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2,300 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.95 ms, flip angle (FA): 90\u00b0, field of view (FoV): 225 \u00d7 240 mm, matrix = 240 \u00d7 256, 160 volumes. Rest state fMRI data was acquired with echo-planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence. Parameters are as follows: TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 30 ms, FA = 70\u00b0, FoV = 24 \u00d7 24 cm, matrix = 64 \u00d7 64, slice thickness = 3 mm, measurements = 212. \n\n\n#### Preprocessing \n  \nImage preprocessing was conducted by DPARSF V4.4, a data processing assistant for resting-state fMRI developed by Yan et al. ( ). Preprocessing steps are as follows: (1) removing first 10 time points; (2) slice timing; (3) realignment; (4) nuisance covariates regression (liner trend, Friston-24 head motion parameters, global signal, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid signal); (5) normalizing to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, resample to 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm  voxels; (6) smooth with 4-mm FWMH Gaussian kernel; (7) filter (0.01\u20130.1 Hz). We made global signal regression (GSR) for getting more reliable and accurate data. Several advantages of GSR have been reported including closer relationship to DTI-based anatomy, better delineation of subcortical nuclei, improved specificity of positive correlations, and removal of motion, cardiac and respiratory signals known to correlate with the global signal ( ). We calculated the mean framewise displacement (FD) to evaluate the head motion. The FD threshold is 2.5 mm and 2.5\u00b0. The head motion exceeded 2.5 mm or 2.5\u00b0 in any direction or angular would be excluded in our analysis (One participate is excluded in the fMRI analysis). The FD was calculated for all resting state volumes ( ). The mean FD is derived from Jenkinson's relative root mean square (RMS) algorithm ( ). We also used New Segment function in DPARSF to calculate gray matter volume, which was used as a covariate later. \n\n\n#### Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nAccording to the coordinate proposed by Dosenbach et al. ( ), region of interests (ROIs; bilateral dlPFC, separate) were generated as 6-mm radius spheres using the WFU_Pickatlas 3.0.5. Seed-based FC was used to calculate the FC between ROIs and whole brain. A Fisher's   Z   analysis was used to transform correlation coefficient values to z-score. \n\n\n#### fALFF Analysis \n  \nfALFF (fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations) is an effective index to reflect the intensity of spontaneous neural activity for resting state fMRI study ( ). We conducted fALFF analysis for all ROIs and further conducted an exploratory whole-brain analysis to explore brain activity associated with EF. \n\n\n\n### Statistics Analysis \n  \nDemographic and clinical data analysis were conducted by SPSS 18.0. Chi-square test was used for categorical variables and   T  -test was used for continuous variables. We did not conduct the correction for multiple comparisons across statistical tests on neuropsychological performance. We paid more attention on the posttreatment patients and HCs rather than these three groups. \n\nFor fMRI data, we make a contrast for FC and fALFF after treatment of patients with HC by DPABI. To avoid the effect of anatomical variation ( ,  ), we added gray matter volume as covariates. We also added potential confounded factors (HAMD score and head motion were added in the study) as covariates. Gaussian Random Field (GRF) Theory correction was used for multiple comparison correction with voxel   p   < 0.001. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and Clinical Characteristic \n  \nNo significant difference was found between patients who was included in analysis and those excluded from analysis in age, gender, years of education, age of first onset, symptom severity, SCWT, DST, WCST, and SVFT (all   p  s > 0.05). There was also no significant difference between MDD patients and HC in age, gender, and years of education. MDD patients scored lower than HC in SCWT and SVFT at baseline, but these differences disappeared at 8 weeks. Compared to baseline, MDD patients showed a significant reduction in HAMD-17 score and all patients were in remission or partial remission (particularly, 11 patients were in remission and 15 patients showed a reduction in HAMD more than 50%). But, MDD patients still had a higher HAMD-17 score compared to HC after treatment. Compared to baseline, MDD patients had a significant improvement in RC and RE of WCST, and showed a trend to improvement in SVFT, errors of SCWT, and CC in WCST (see  ). \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristic of MDD and HC. \n    \n\n### fMRI Data \n  \nCompared to HC, MDD patients showed increased positive FC between cerebellar Crus I and left dlPFC regions. MDD patients had significantly higher positive FC between right dlPFC and right supramarginal gyrus (SMG), angular gyrus (AG), inferior parietal lobule regions (IPL; see   and  ). We did not detect any group difference of fALFF. \n  \nRegions showing abnormal connectivity with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in MDD compared to HC. \n  \n GRF correction for multiple comparison correction with voxel p < 0.001  . \n\n L, Left; R, Right; dlPFC, Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; SMG, Supramarginal gyrus; AG, Angular gyrus; IPL, Inferior parietal lobule  . \n    \nIncreased functional connectivity with bilateral dlPFCin MDD patients compared to HC.

(B)   MDD patients showed increased FC between right dlPFC andone cluster including SMG, AG, and IPL. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nClinicians generally accept that MDD patients demonstrate dysfunctional cognition, especially dysfunctional EF in acute phase. However, few of clinicians realize persistent cognition impairment in euthymia ( ) because of inconsistent research results, improved subjective experience ( ,  ), and a lack of objective cognition tests that are appropriate and can be easily implemented for MDD patients ( ). Here, we made a further exploration of cognition performance in remitted and partially remitted MDD patients   via   multiple EF tests and fMRI, in order to reconcile inconsistencies of published literatures and developed the understanding of persistent EF in remitted MDD patients. In addition, our study reminds clinicians to focus on EF in remitted MDD patients. \n\nWe found an increased FC between the right dlPFC and right SMG. SMG together with AG forms temporoparietal junction (TPJ) ( ). Carter et al. indicated that TPJ is involved in language, memory, attention, and social processing, and the convergent processing in TPJ provide context for behavior ( ). Wu et al. suggested that TPJ plays a critical role in the integration of bottom-up and top-down attentional control ( ). SMG is close to IPL, which is another region involved in adjust control in FPN and functionally connected with dlPFC ( ). Therefore, the increased FC between dlPFC and SMG may suggest a neurocompensatory effect of EF network. \n\nWe also found that MDD patients showed an increased FC between the right cerebellar Crus I and left dlPFC than HC. Schmahmann reviewed that patients with cerebellum damage showed persistent EF impairment ( ). fMRI studies showed that posterior lobe of cerebellum, especially cerebellar Crus I, was activated during EF tasks ( ). At network level, cerebellum is functionally connected to task control network such as FPN and SN ( ). fMRI studies further revealed that cerebellum generates error codes and transmit error-related signals to dlPFC, which contributes to rapid, continuous adjustment and control ( ,  ). Previous studies reported abnormal function and structure of cerebellum in current MDD. For example, Depping et al. demonstrated bilaterally increased regional cerebellar blood flow ( ). Guo et al. found that MDD patients had altered fALFF and FC in cerebellar lobule VI and Crus I ( ). Arnone et al. reported gray matter reduction in the cerebellum in MDD patients ( ). All these results suggested that there may be an altered error processing in MDD. Disturbed error processing may persist with the remssion of major clinical symptoms. Depping et al. show increased volume of bilateral cerebellum in remitted MDD patients ( ). Sun et al. showed an increased regional homogeneity in individuals at risk of depression ( ). Consistent with these results, although we did not detect any group difference of fALFF, we found an increased FC between cerebellum and dlPFC in the present study, which may suggest an enhanced processing of bottom-up feedback in remitted or partially remitted MDD patients. In line with the notion, Bijsterbosch et al. indicated that enhanced FC on frontal cortex with cerebellum was associated with supraliminal error correction ( ). To our knowledge, other studies reported abnormal FC associated with cognition between cerebellum and other brain region such as temporal cortex ( ) and posterior cingulate cortex ( ), however, this is the first study that reported an enhanced feedback processing in remitted and partially remitted MDD patients. Therefore, more researches are needed to replicate the result. \n\nTaken together, although MDD patients showed improvement in SVFT, SCWT, WCST, and were comparable with HC on all EF tests after 8-weeks treatment, we still found an increased intrinsic connectivity within the EF network in remitted and partially remitted MDD patients. The result remained true in the case of taking residual depressive symptoms into account, which suggested that EF impairment might be a trait-like characteristic of MDD and fluoxetine only could improve impaired EF to some extent rather than resolve. More generally, conventional antidepressant like selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors may fail to resolve executive dysfunction of MDD patients. Persistent EF impairment have a negative influence on the social ability and functional recovery ( ). Therefore, adjunctive treatment targeting to EF may contribute to maximize the efficacy of routine therapy. Compared to placebo and duloxetine, Mahableshwarkar et al. found that vortioxetine had significant and direct improved effects on EF in MDD patients ( ). Similarly, Smith et al. found that vortioxetine increased efficiency of neural circuit supporting EF in remitted MDD patients whose EF performance in comparison with HC, which suggested that vortioxetine had direct and mood-independent effects on EF ( ). Since we found neurocompensatory effects, i.e., inefficient neural activity, vortioxetine may be an effective candidate drug for impaired EF of MDD. Erythropoietin is another alternative drug for improving EF. Miskowiak et al. indicated that erythropoietin significantly improved neural correlates of EF and the effect was dissociated from mood symptoms or red blood cells ( ). Besides drug therapy, cognitive remediation training and non-invasive neuromodulatory treatment such as transcranial magnetic/direct current stimulation may be a potential candidate therapy for impaired EF ( ,  ). Our study reminds clinicians that improvement in the clinical symptoms of MDD patients does not mean remitted EF. It may be necessary to focus on the EF of patients with who are in clinical remission and partial remission, and to adjust the existing treatment strategy to assist with physical therapy or psychotherapy to improve the executive function of patients. \n\nSeveral limitations of present study should be noted. Firstly, the 8-weeks treatment period is short. Some patients did not achieve full remission and the HAMD score of the MDD group is still higher than HC. We cannot rule out the potential confounding effects of residual symptoms though we add it as covariates. Secondly, the study is a pseudo-longitude study because we did not follow HC. Therefore, we cannot explain the practice and time effects. Thirdly, we used a small sample size because only these patients completed fMRI and all tests we needed at week 8, and we did not assess each aspect of EF yet in the study. Abnormal FC in EF network may due to other components of EF we did not access. Further studies using overall assessment of EF, large MDD sample with long-term treatment, ideally, full recover patients can be an important complement to our study. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nEF impairment is still observed in MDD patients despite the remission or partially remission of depressive symptoms. Clinicians should focus on the residual cognitive symptoms, which contribute to the increased therapeutic effect of antidepressants. Furthermore, enhanced intrinsic FC within EF network may be a potential neural target for intervention of EF. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Ethical Committee of the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University.

Hum Brain Mapp 35:61\u201374, 2014. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nThe comprehension of spoken utterances is a highly challenging task due to the transient nature of auditory speech stimuli and its vulnerability to ambiguity. The success of our sensory system to convey most stimuli with reasonable precision despite the regular disturbance of noise has been attributed to its constant anticipation of upcoming events [Bar,  ; Enns and Lleras,  ; Friston,  ]. That is, perception is not simply a passive reflection of sensory input but arises from an active integration of sensory data and prior expectations. According to the framework of predictive coding [Friston,  ; Rao and Ballard,  ], such expectations can resolve perceptual ambiguities because prior knowledge and context information incorporated in the predictions might help to decode noisy stimuli. Predictive coding is conceptually related to, e.g., semantic or contextual priming but refers to the use of any kind of prior information. In fact, priming may thus be regarded as a special instance of predictive coding in which a single piece of prior information (the prime) influences the processing of the subsequent stimulus. \n\nEvidence for predictive coding has been observed in visual processing [e.g., Hosoya et al.,  ; Sharma et al.,  ; Summerfield et al., 2006], in tactilo\u2010motor interactions [Blakemore et al.,  ], in motor preparation [Jakobs et al.,  ] and in audiovisual perception [Arnal et al.,  ; den Ouden et al.,  ,  ]. However, rather little is known about the role of predictive coding in auditory speech perception despite the fact that comparable expectation\u2010generating mechanisms involving interactions between bottom\u2010up and top\u2010down processing have often been deemed crucial for speech perception [e.g., Davis and Johnsrude,  ; Grossberg,  ]. Furthermore, auditory processing is thought to be hierarchically organized such that higher processing levels respond to increasingly more complex and abstract sound properties. In accordance with this hierarchical organization, research has identified at least three distinct levels of auditory processing in nonhuman primates. Specifically, with increasing complexity, sound information proceeds from the core region of the auditory cortex to the belt and the more lateral parabelt area [Kaas and Hackett,  ; Rauschecker et al.,  ]. Neuroimaging studies have found a comparable hierarchical processing pattern in humans in response to complex sounds [Hall et al.,  ] and to spoken language [Scott et al.,  ]. Whereas the core and belt areas of the auditory cortex in the superior temporal gyrus are responsive to the amplitude and frequency modulations of speech, left lateralized cortical regions including the posterior inferior parietal lobe, middle temporal gyrus, fusiform and parahippocampal gyrus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate gyrus seem to be involved in speech\u2010specific semantic processing [Binder et al.,  ]. \n\nPreviously, indications for effects of prior knowledge on speech perception have been demonstrated in studies showing that speech can be decoded even when extremely distorted [Remez et al.,  ; Saberi and Perrott,  ; Shannon et al.,  ] and that perception of degraded speech can improve through training [Davis et al.,  ; Giraud et al.,  ; Hannemann et al.,  ]. Moreover, comprehension of degraded speech stimuli after training was associated with increased blood\u2010oxygen\u2010level\u2010dependent (BOLD) activity in the right superior temporal sulcus and bilateral middle and inferior temporal gyri [Giraud et al.,  ] and with increased gamma band activity in left temporal regions [Hannemann et al.,  ] when compared to exposure to the degraded stimuli prior to the training. As noted above, however, experiments in the visual domain have demonstrated analogous perceptual and/or neural effects of prior information also without requiring a training phase. That is, degraded images could be recognized instantaneously once the original (nondegraded) image had been shown [e.g., Ludmer et al.,  ; Porter,  ]. However, the neural mechanisms of corresponding phenomena in the auditory domain (i.e., speech perception) are yet unknown. \n\nTo shed light on this question, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity during the perception of spectrally degraded sentences following exposure to an equally degraded or, which is the critical condition, following exposure to a nondegraded sentence. Importantly, the employed spectral degradation (see Methods for details) produced sentences that were incomprehensible when heard in isolation but which became comprehensible (i.e., their meaning could be extracted) when having been preceded by their original (nondegraded) version. In light of the predictive\u2010coding framework, the comprehension of degraded speech can be explained by the formation of a template based on the processing of the preceding nondegraded sentence. This template consists of predictive codes that, if matching with subsequent input, carry enough information for the successful decoding of degraded speech. Subsequently, we refer to this prediction\u2010based understanding of speech as \u201cmeaning extraction,\u201d although we do not claim that this process can be mechanistically equated with a direct decoding of the degraded sentence. Alternatively, understanding might stem from an indirect meaning reactivation that is triggered after the degraded sentence is \u201crecognized\u201d based on structural commonalities (e.g., prosody) with the template. Most probably, however, both processes\u2014direct meaning decoding based on lexical\u2010semantic predictions and meaning retrieval based on a structural match with previous language input\u2014run in parallel. In any case, the prediction\u2010dependent understanding of degraded language offers an excellent opportunity to investigate the neural mechanisms of integrating sensory data and prior knowledge in speech processing. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty\u2010nine healthy participants took part in this study (14 females, mean age = 34.5 years, SD = 12.2 years). All participants were right\u2010handed, native speakers of German, had no history of neurological or psychiatric diseases, and gave written informed consent prior to participation. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the RWTH Aachen University. \n\n\n### Paradigm and Stimuli \n  \nThe participants performed a delayed\u2010matching\u2010to\u2010sample task in which a target sentence had to be compared with a preceding reference sentence. The stimuli comprised 25 sentences, each in a nondegraded and a degraded version. All stimuli had been developed for a previous fMRI experiment and are described in detail in Meyer et al.  . In brief, the sentences were recordings of short declarative infinitival statements of similar length (mean duration = 3.8 s, SD = 0.3 s), spoken by the same female speaker. A transcription of these sentences can be found in the Supporting Information. Degraded versions of these sentences (see the Supporting Information for a sound example) were created by low\u2010pass filtering and an additional removal of aperiodic signals. This procedure included a reduction of spectral information to frequencies containing the   F   as well as the 2nd and 3rd harmonic (see Supporting Information Fig. S1 for spectrograms of a nondegraded sentence and its degraded version). Thus, the resulting degraded stimuli merely retained the prosodic parameters of the original version (i.e., intonation, duration, and suprasegmental acoustic modulations) but lack any segmental and lexical information. Unlike purely low\u2010pass filtered sentences, the degraded sentences employed in the present study sound like a humming voice heard from behind a door and are virtually impossible to understand without prior presentation of the nondegraded version as a reference [Meyer et al.,  ]. \n\nThe experiment consisted of five blocks, each containing two subblocks of 10 events. For each event, the stimuli were presented in pairs consisting of a reference sentence followed by a target sentence for comparison. While the target sentence always was a degraded sentence, the type of the preceding reference sentence alternated between sub\u2010blocks: it was degraded in the first sub\u2010block and nondegraded in the second sub\u2010block. The reason for keeping the order of sub\u2010blocks constant (rather than randomizing them) was twofold. First, we wanted to minimize task\u2010switching demands. Second, we wanted to ensure that the target sentences preceded by degraded reference sentences (structural match and mismatch conditions, cf., Table  ) were processed as spectrally degraded, incomprehensible sentences. Therefore, we decided to present them always in the first sub\u2010block before the template based on the intact sentence could be formed (i.e., before encountering the nondegraded version in the second sub\u2010block). Each sub\u2010block consisted of five matching and five nonmatching pairs presented in randomized order. Within each block, the pairs in either sub\u2010block were based on combinations of the same five sentences to ensure equivalent stimulus material and hence sensory input for both sub\u2010blocks. The order of sentence presentation within each sub\u2010block and the order of blocks were pseudo\u2010randomized across participants. In sum, the type of reference sentence (degraded vs. nondegraded) varied between sub\u2010blocks to minimize trial\u2010to\u2010trial task\u2010switching effects, while the type of reference\u2013target match (match vs. mismatch) varied between trials (i.e., within sub\u2010blocks) to allow for an event\u2010related analysis of hemodynamic activity (see below). The current experiment thus uses an event\u2010 (epoch\u2010) related design for modeling and analysis, which was embedded in an overarching block\u2010structure of event\u2010presentation to reduce confounding effects of task\u2010switching.\n \n  \nOverview of conditions \n  \nOur pairing scheme yielded four conditions (Table  ): (1) a structural match condition when two identical degraded sentences were presented; (2) a structural mismatch condition when two different degraded sentences were presented; (3) a propositional match condition when a nondegraded reference sentence was identical to the degraded target (i.e., the target sentence was the degraded version of the reference sentence); and (4) a propositional mismatch condition when a nondegraded reference was different from the degraded target (i.e., the target sentence was not the degraded version of the reference sentence). The first two conditions thus require sentence comparisons that are entirely based on \u201cstructural\u201d information such as prosody, suprasegmental acoustic modulations, intonation, pitch, etc. The latter two conditions in contrast enable comparisons that are additionally based on lexical\u2010semantic (\u201cpropositional\u201d) information provided by the nondegraded reference sentence. Importantly, the propositional match condition evoked an understanding of the degraded target (as established by pretesting). Therefore, this condition allowed for meaning extraction from the degraded (and normally unintelligible) target. \n\nEach of the 25 degraded sentences was presented exactly once as a target in every condition. Therefore, the stimulus material constituting the (crucial) second part of each event was identical across conditions. Thus, the only difference between conditions that could explain differential fMRI results was (1) whether only structural or also propositional information was provided by the reference sentence, and (2) whether this information matched the target sentence. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nAfter receiving task instructions, participants performed a practice run with sentence pairs different from those in the main experiment. The practice run was introduced to familiarize participants with the auditory stimuli and with the sequence of events. After entering the MR scanner, a sequence of test scans was run while examples of practice sentence stimuli were presented. This was done to allow an individual adjustment of the headphone volume for each participant and ensure that the sentence stimuli were well audible with the scanner noise in the background. Subsequently, the experiment started. Following the presentation of each sentence pair, a display was shown for 2 s asking participants to indicate by left or right button press whether or not the sentence pair contained two identical sentences. Participants were instructed to respond as fast as possible. Left/right response assignment was counterbalanced across participants such that half the participants responded with the left hand and the other half responded with the right hand to specify identical sentences. After a jittered intertrial interval of 4\u20139 s (uniformly distributed), the next sentence pair was presented. The sentences within each pair were separated by an interstimulus interval of 1 s. The sub\u2010blocks lasted about 3 min and were separated by a 20\u2010s resting period from each other. A warning tone in combination with a warning on the display was presented 1\u20133 s prior to the end of the resting period to prepare participants for the upcoming sub\u2010block. The total time spent in the scanner was \u223c35 min. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Acquisition and Preprocessing \n  \nImaging was performed on a Siemens Trio 3\u2010T whole\u2010body scanner (Erlangen, Germany) using gradient\u2010echo echo\u2010planar imaging (EPI). T2*\u2010weighted BOLD contrast volumes covering the whole brain were acquired (TR = 2.2 s, in\u2010plane resolution = 3.1 \u00d7 3.1 mm , 36 axial slices of 3.1 mm thickness, distance factor = 15%). To allow for magnetic\u2010field saturation, image acquisition was preceded by four dummy images which were discarded prior to data analysis. Images were analyzed using SPM5 ( ). The EPI images were corrected for head movement by affine registration using a two\u2010pass procedure. This included an initial realignment of all images to the first image and a subsequent realignment to the mean of the realigned images. After realignment, the mean EPI image of each participant was spatially normalized to the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) single\u2010subject template using the unified segmentation approach (Ashburner and Friston,  ). The resulting parameters that define the deformation field necessary to move the participant's data into the space of the MNI tissue probability maps were then combined with the deformation field transforming between the latter and the MNI single\u2010subject template. The ensuing deformation was subsequently applied to the individual EPI volumes that were thereby transformed into the MNI single\u2010subject space and resampled at 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm  voxel size. Finally, these normalized images were spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8\u2010mm full width at half\u2010maximum. \n\n\n### Data Analysis \n  \nBehavioral data were analyzed using SPSS 18.0.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Reaction time and accuracy were subjected to 2 \u00d7 2 repeated\u2010measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to test the effects of the factors Match (matching vs. nonmatching sentence pairs) and Type of Prior (propositional vs. structural). Furthermore, reaction time of match and nonmatch trials was separately calculated for correct and incorrect trials (i.e., hits, misses, correct rejections, false alarms) and tested for the effects of signal\u2010detection category and Type of Prior by a 4 \u00d7 2 ANOVA. Note that hits and misses were computed from correct and incorrect responses on match trials, respectively, and correct rejections and false alarms were computed from correct and incorrect responses on mismatch trials, respectively. Post\u2010hoc analyses were Bonferroni\u2010corrected for multiple comparisons. Finally, paired   t   tests were used to test for group\u2010level differences in sensitivity (  d  ') and decision criterion (  c  ) between the different types of prior. The   d  ' parameter was calculated based on the convention suggested for same\u2013different designs [Macmillan and Creelman,  ] using the formula\n with\n where \u03d5 is the standard normal cumulative density function,   H   is the hit rate (i.e., proportion of match responses when pairs actually were matches), and   F   is the false\u2010alarm rate (i.e., proportion of match responses when pairs actually were mismatches). The decision criterion   c   was calculated by the formula\n \n\nAdmittedly, typical same\u2013different experiments within the signal\u2010detection framework differ from the current experiment in terms of the number and complexity of stimuli. This analysis, however, was only performed to provide evidence for equivalent levels of difficulty across both types of prior. For this purpose, applying the same\u2013different convention should provide an acceptable approximation. \n\nImaging data were analyzed using the general linear model as implemented in SPM5. For each of the six events of interest (presentation of nondegraded or degraded reference sentences, presentation of target sentences from one of the four conditions: structural match, structural mismatch, propositional match, and propositional mismatch), the hemodynamic response was separately modeled by a boxcar reference vector (duration: 4 s) convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and its first\u2010order temporal derivative. The four target sentence regressors thus defined the four conditions which were identical with regard to sensory input but differed with regard to the type of input provided by the preceding reference sentence. Importantly, we limited our analysis to those target sentences that evoked correct match or mismatch responses (i.e., hits or correct rejections, respectively). Accordingly, a nuisance regressor for target sentences in trials with incorrect responses was included in the first\u2010level model. The reason for restricting the analysis to correct trials was to ensure that participants paid attention to the task at hand during all trials included. However, one disadvantage of this approach is the potential reduction of statistical power due to the exclusion of trials. Furthermore, this exclusion may perturb the a\u2010priori identical distribution of target stimuli across the four conditions because some of the excluded target sentences may still be present in one of the other conditions. We therefore computed a supplementary analysis based on all trials in which we reanalyzed the imaging data from all trials without the nuisance regressor. \n\nAdditional nuisance regressors were included for experimental events of no interest: left and right button presses and head movements as reflected by six motion parameters for translation and rotation. Finally, reaction time was included as parametric modulator for the structural match, structural mismatch, propositional match, and propositional mismatch regressors to assess intraindividual variation of brain activity related to performance level. Low\u2010frequency signal drifts were removed by employing a high\u2010pass filter with a cut\u2010off period of 128 s. After correction of the time series for dependent observations according to an autoregressive first\u2010order correlation structure, parameter estimates of the HRF regressors were calculated for each voxel using weighted least squares to provide maximum\u2010likelihood estimators based on the temporal autocorrelation of the data [Kiebel et al.,  ]. The individual first\u2010level contrasts (each condition relative to the implicit baseline) were then fed into a second\u2010level random\u2010effects ANOVA. \n\nIn this group analysis, mean parameter estimates over all participants were computed for all six regressors of interest (cf., above) as well as for the four parametric modulators (reflecting reaction times) and the two motor\u2010response nuisance regressors (left/right button press). Based on these estimates, separate t\u2010contrasts within the ANOVA were calculated for testing differential effects. Furthermore, differential effects were combined into conjunctions based on the minimum t\u2010statistic [Nichols et al.,  ]. Conjunction analysis was chosen because of its higher specificity and more conservative character as compared with a factorial analysis. In particular, by using a conjunction analysis, we constrained inference to those regions that were significantly present in all of the included conditions. All resulting activation maps were thresholded at   P   < 0.05 (family\u2010wise error (FWE)\u2010corrected for multiple comparisons at cluster level; cluster\u2010forming threshold at voxel level:   P   < 0.001) and anatomically localized using probabilistic maps of cytoarchitectonically defined areas [Amunts et al.,  ; Zilles and Amunts,  ] using version 1.6b of the SPM Anatomy toolbox [Eickhoff et al.,  ;  ]. \n\nTo identify regions implicated in the processing of all six sentence type events, the conjunction \u201cnondegraded reference sentence \u2229 degraded reference sentence \u2229 structural match \u2229 structural mismatch \u2229 propositional match \u2229 propositional mismatch\u201d was used. This analysis should thus reflect regions commonly activated by the sound stimuli or recruited by the general task demands (e.g., working memory, decision making). The contrast \u201cdegraded reference sentence > nondegraded reference sentence\u201d was employed to isolate regions that are more activated by the unintelligible sounds as compared to meaningful verbal information. The inverse contrast \u201cnondegraded reference sentence > degraded reference sentence\u201d was analyzed to discern regions more tuned to intelligible speech than to (unintelligible) dynamic intonation contour. The latter contrast should thus identify regions that are selectively involved in processing the lexical\u2010semantic aspects of speech. \n\nThree conjunctions were employed to unravel the effects of the propositional prior compared to a purely structural prior, i.e., the effects of a nondegraded reference sentence compared to a degraded reference sentence on the subsequent processing of the degraded target sentence. To ensure that all activations associated with the propositional prior effect were specific for intelligible speech, the contrast \u201cnondegraded reference sentence > degraded reference sentence\u201d was always included in these conjunctions. That is, we compared differential effects of the previously heard sentence on the processing of the identical (precisely the same target stimuli were presented in all four conditions) degraded sentences, but restricted this analysis to those regions that were actually involved in processing nondegraded (i.e., intelligible) speech, as opposed to degraded (i.e., normally unintelligible) speech. Hence, all these analyses should exclusively reveal effects within the brain network subserving lexical\u2010semantic speech processing. First, the conjunction \u201c[(propositional match + propositional mismatch) > (structural match + structural mismatch)] \u2229 (nondegraded reference sentence > degraded reference sentence)\u201d aimed at identifying the general effect of exposure to a propositional prior as compared to a structural prior. This conjunction thus should specifically reveal those effects on the processing of the degraded target sentence that stem from any lexical\u2010semantic influence provided by the reference sentence while controlling for (mis)matching of prosody (as this process should affect all target sentences alike, independently of whether the prior was propositional or structural). Second, the conjunction \u201c(propositional match > structural match) \u2229 (propositional match > structural mismatch) \u2229 (nondegraded reference sentence > degraded reference sentence)\u201d was used to reveal the effects of a propositional match on brain activity within the lexical\u2010semantic network (as defined by the last component of the conjunction). Finally, the conjunction \u201c(propositional mismatch > structural mismatch) \u2229 (propositional mismatch > structural match) \u2229 (nondegraded reference sentence > degraded reference sentence)\u201d was employed to reveal the effects of a propositional mismatch on brain activity within the lexical\u2010semantic network. Furthermore, we performed an additional analysis of these effects that was not restricted to those regions more responsive to intelligible compared to degraded speech. \n\nFurthermore, we directly tested for differences between propositional matches and mismatches via (i) the contrast \u201cpropositional match > propositional mismatch\u201d masked inclusively with the above analysis aiming at identifying effects of propositional matches [(propositional match > structural match) \u2229 (propositional match > structural mismatch) \u2229 (nondegraded reference sentence > degraded reference sentence)] and (ii) the contrast \u201cpropositional mismatch > propositional match\u201d masked again inclusively with the above mentioned propositional mismatch effect \u201c(propositional mismatch > structural mismatch) \u2229 (propositional mismatch > structural match) \u2229 (nondegraded reference sentence > degraded reference sentence).\u201d \n\nIn addition, we investigated the effect of matches versus mismatches across both types of priors by the conjunctions \u201c(propositional match > propositional mismatch) \u2229 (structural match > structural mismatch)\u201d and \u201c(propositional mismatch > propositional match) \u2229 (structural mismatch > structural match).\u201d \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Behavioral Results \n  \nOverall, the accuracy of identity judgments was comparable for targets following propositional and structural priors (83 and 79% correct responses, respectively). The 2 \u00d7 2 (Match: yes/no \u00d7 Type of Prior: propositional/structural) ANOVA of accuracy revealed a significant main effect of Match [  F  (1, 28) = 29.93,   P   < 0.001] and a significant Match \u00d7 Type of Prior interaction [  F  (1, 28) = 12.02,   P   < 0.002; Fig.  A]. Type of Prior had no significant main effect [  F  (1, 28) = 3.86,   p   > .05]. Thus, although accuracy was generally lower on nonmatch than match trials, this drop of accuracy was significantly stronger for targets following structural rather than propositional priors. An ANOVA of reaction time indicated a significant main effect of Match [  F  (1, 28) = 12.91,   P   = 0.001]. Responses were faster for matching than nonmatching pairs, independent of Type of Prior (propositional/structural). When splitting match and nonmatch trials into correct and incorrect trials (i.e., hits, misses, correct rejections, false alarms), a 4(Category) \u00d7 2(Type of Prior) ANOVA showed a main effect of Category [  F  (3,18 = 10.99,   P   < 0.001; Fig.  B], indicating that in particular incorrect decision trials (misses and false alarms) were associated with slower responses. Specifically, after Bonferroni correction, hits (i.e., correct match decisions) were significantly faster than misses (i.e., incorrect nonmatch decisions), and correct rejections (i.e., correct nonmatch decisions) were faster than false alarms (i.e., incorrect match decisions). Furthermore, hits were also faster than false alarms. These results suggest that the above\u2010reported main effect of Match on reaction time is mainly due to the fast responses on hit trials.\n \n  \nBehavioral data. Accuracy (  A  ) and reaction time (  B  ) of target sentences following structural (dark gray) and propositional (light gray) priors. Panel   C   depicts measures of discriminability (  d  \u2032) and bias (  c  ) as derived from same\u2010different signal\u2010detection analyses for the two types of prior. Positive   d  \u2032 values reflect discriminability above chance level. Negative c values indicate a bias toward \u201csame\u201d responses (i.e., a more lenient criterion), whereas positive c values signifies a bias toward \u201cdifferent\u201d responses. Error bars represent the standard error of the means. * = significant at   P   < 0.01. \n  \nSignal\u2010detection parameters for observer sensitivity (  d'  ) and decision criterion (  c  ) were calculated to investigate differences in discriminability and response tendency, respectively (Fig.  C). Paired   t   tests revealed no difference in   d'   between propositional and structural priors [  t  (1, 28) = 1.19,   P   = 0.243] but showed that   c   was significantly lower for structural than for propositional priors [  t  (1, 28) = 3.89,   P   < 0.001]. Thus, discrimination difficulty in trials with structural versus propositional priors was comparable, while responses following structural priors were relatively more biased toward \u201csame\u201d responses (i.e., match decisions) than responses following propositional priors. Finally, no sex differences were observed for any of the behavioral measures. \n\n\n### fMRI Results \n  \n#### General overview \n  \nActivations common to all six sentence types (nondegraded reference sentence \u2229 degraded reference sentence \u2229 structural match \u2229 structural mismatch \u2229 propositional match \u2229 propositional mismatch) were found bilaterally in temporal and frontal areas, in the supplementary motor area (SMA), premotor cortex, and cerebellum (Fig.  A). Next, the contrast between nondegraded and degraded reference sentences revealed significant clusters in the left IFG [area 44, 45; Amunts et al.,  ], bilateral MTG/STG [TE1.0, TE 1.1; Morosan et al.,  ], precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus [SUB; Amunts et al.,  ], amygdala [CM; Amunts et al.,  ], thalamus, as well as dorsomedial and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC; Fig.  B). The inverse contrast (Fig.  C) revealed higher activation in bilateral insula, middle frontal gyrus, and middle cingulate cortex, in right IFG (area 44), rolandic operculum [OP4; Eickhoff et al.,  ], and inferior parietal cortex, as well as left cerebellum, premotor cortex, and pre\u2010SMA.\n \n  \nOverview of the general fMRI findings. (  A  ) The conjunction (nondegraded reference sentence \u2229 degraded reference sentence \u2229 structural match \u2229 structural mismatch \u2229 propositional match \u2229 propositional mismatch) revealed bilateral activations reflecting auditory processing common to all six sentence type events. (  B  ) Regions representing the lexical\u2010semantic rather than the prosodic aspects of speech (nondegraded reference sentence > degraded reference sentence) and (  C  ) the inverse contrast (degraded reference sentence > nondegraded reference sentence). All images are thresholded at   P   < 0.05 (FWE\u2010corrected at cluster\u2010level; cluster forming threshold at voxel level:   P   < 0.001). \n  \nFurthermore, reaction times of the sentence comparisons were included as parametric modulators of the BOLD response to target sentence presentation in each of the four conditions. No significant correlations between reaction time and BOLD response were observed in the group analysis. \n\n\n#### Effect of propositional priors \n  \nTo identify the general effect of exposure to propositional priors on the processing of (degraded) targets, we employed the following conjunction: [(propositional match + propositional mismatch) > (structural match + structural mismatch)] \u2229 (nondegraded reference sentence > degraded reference sentence). Three left\u2010hemispheric clusters localized in the IFG (area 44/45), MTG and AG (PGa/PGp) resulted from this conjunction (Fig.  A and Table  ).\n \n  \nEffects of propositional prior were all left\u2010lateralized.   A  ) Regions within the lexical\u2010semantic network responding more to degraded targets that were preceded by propositional compared to structural priors \u201c[(propositional match + propositional mismatch) > (structural match + structural mismatch)] \u2229 (nondegraded reference sentence > degraded reference sentence).\u201d Dissociation of this network into   B  ) left MTG and AG for propositional matches [(propositional match > structural match) \u2229 (propositional match > structural mismatch) \u2229 (nondegraded reference sentence > degraded reference sentence)] and   C  ) Broca's area for propositional mismatches [(propositional mismatch > structural mismatch) \u2229 (propositional mismatch > structural match) \u2229 (nondegraded reference sentence > degraded reference sentence)]. All images are thresholded at   P   < 0.05 (FWE\u2010corrected at cluster\u2010level; cluster forming threshold at voxel level:   P   < 0.001). See also Supporting Information Figures S2 and S4. \n    \nOverview of activations \n    \nWhen focusing on activations related to propositional matches [(propositional match > structural match) \u2229 (propositional match > structural mismatch) \u2229 (nondegraded reference sentence > degraded reference sentence)], the resulting pattern no longer included Broca's region (area 44/45) but was confined to the left AG and left MTG (Fig  B and Table  ). Broca's region (area 44/45), however, was the only region associated with propositional mismatches [(propositional mismatch > structural match) \u2229 (propositional mismatch > structural mismatch) \u2229 (nondegraded reference sentence > degraded reference sentence)] (Fig.  C and Table  ). Direct comparison between propositional matches and mismatches revealed that Broca's region (area 44/45) was the only cluster showing significantly increased activation in response to propositional mismatches compared to propositional matches. No such specific association could be established for the MTG; however, the AG was more strongly activated in response to propositional matches compared to propositional mismatches. \n\nWe repeated this analysis without including the contrast \u201cnondegraded reference sentence > degraded reference sentence\u201d in the conjunctions. For the general effect of propositional prior and propositional match, we observed additional activations in some areas including the left inferior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (see Supporting Information Fig. S2 for details). \n\n\n#### Effects of reference\u2013target match versus mismatch \n  \nRegions responding more strongly to reference\u2013target matches than mismatches in general comprised the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) and the bilateral putamen. Conversely, reference\u2013target mismatches selectively activated the pre\u2010SMA bilaterally as well as the right insula and right IFG (see Supporting Information Fig. S3). \n\n\n#### Supplementary analysis \n  \nIn addition to the main analysis based only on correct trials, a supplementary analysis was performed involving all trials. The results (see Supporting Information Table SI for details) were largely comparable to those of the main analysis; however, some interesting differences emerged. When testing for the effect of a propositional (relative to a structural) prior on the processing of a (degraded) target sentence, we again found the left MTG and IFG, but instead of activation in the left AG, we now observed significant activity in the left thalamus. According to the thalamic connectivity atlas ( ), 65% of this thalamic activation was localized in a section having connections with the prefrontal cortex, and 29% of the cluster was localized in a section connecting to the temporal cortex. These thalamic areas are thought to include the mediodorsal nucleus and nuclei of the anterior complex [Behrens et al.,  ]. Analogous to the main analysis  ,   the comparison to targets with structural priors revealed that the left MTG and thalamus (60% of the cluster predominantly connecting to the prefrontal cortex, 36% predominantly connecting to the temporal cortex) were responsive to propositional matches, whereas Broca's region (area 44/45) was responsive to propositional mismatches (see Supporting Information Fig. S4). \n\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThis study investigated the behavioral and neural effects of propositional priors carrying lexical\u2010semantic information on the decoding of degraded speech. As noted above, such decoding should reflect an interaction of sensory input and prior information via lexical\u2010semantic predictions and meaning retrieval. We demonstrated that processing physically identical stimuli may result in distinct patterns of neural activation depending on the type of prior information available to the listener. In particular, prior propositional information provided by intelligible speech (compared to purely \u201cstructural\u201d information provided by degraded speech) resulted in stronger recruitment of a left\u2010lateralized network comprising the MTG, AG (PGa/PGp), and area 44/45 of Broca's region. Within this network a direct comparison between propositional matches and mismatches revealed a selective association of activity in Broca's region with propositional mismatches and a selective association of activity in the AG with propositional matches. A supplementary analysis based on all (instead of correct\u2010only) trials indicated an involvement of the left thalamus (rather than left AG) with propositional priors. \n\nImportantly, reaction time and observer sensitivity did not differ between trials with structural and propositional priors. Therefore, the fMRI results reported here are highly unlikely to be explained by different degrees of task difficulty. Furthermore, we would like to stress that the results are also very unlikely to arise primarily from the matching or recognition of prosody, as this process should be initiated by both types of prior information and is controlled for by the contrasts included in the conjunctions. Rather, the resulting activations most likely stem from the (attempted) lexical\u2010semantic processing of the degraded target sentence when prior propositional information was provided, as this was the only difference between the conditions. Furthermore, in trials with matching propositional priors, this lexical\u2010semantic processing should reflect the subjective impression of understanding the target sentence. In our view, this perceptual phenomenon did not lead to an observable behavioral benefit compared to structural matches, because the two sentences of propositional match trials were physically not entirely identical, in contrast to structural match trials. This physical difference between reference and target in propositional match trials will have made the matching process more challenging, thereby reducing or even outweighing the (presumably) facilitatory effect of understanding the target sentence. We would moreover suggest that the behavioral benefit observed for propositional mismatches (compared to structural mismatches) might be due to the absence of the \u201csudden understanding\u201d phenomenon normally associated with propositional matches: while targets in both propositional and structural mismatch conditions were physically different from the reference, the fact that the target could not be understood despite the nondegraded (propositional) prior should have provided a potent clue facilitating the (overall more difficult) mismatch decision under these circumstances, relative to trials with a nonmatching degraded (structural) prior. \n\nAccording to the dual\u2010stream model of language [Hickok and Poeppel,  ; Hickok et al.,  ] processing of speech sounds recruits temporal lobe structures in a hierarchical dorsal\u2010to\u2010ventral fashion. While the core and belt auditory areas on the planum temporale process simpler aspects of sounds, the more ventrally located superior temporal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus (STG/STS) are more sensitive to complex amplitude and frequency modulations present in speech sounds. Even further ventrally, the MTG and ITG are thought to be involved in the more abstract analysis of semantic and syntactic features of speech. In accordance with this model, the results of the conjunction across all reference and target sentences indicated the involvement of the STG in response to the complex sound properties present across all sentence types. In contrast, comparing nondegraded with degraded reference sentences yielded activity in the MTG but not in the STG. Of note, this contrast and the inverse contrast revealed an activity pattern very similar to that reported by Meyer et al.   for comparing nondegraded and degraded speech. Additionally, other areas including the left AG, left IFG, precuneus, and posterior cingulate that resulted from the comparison of nondegraded vs. degraded speech are associated with the lexical\u2010semantic analysis of meaningful speech [Binder et al.,  ; Price,  ]. \n\nFurthermore, the left MTG together with the left AG (or, when considering all trials in the supplementary analysis, the left MTG and the left thalamus) were activated when target sentences matched the propositional prior, i.e., when meaning could potentially be decoded from a degraded sentence. This finding indicated that speech processing in the MTG, in line with Binder and Price  , does not depend on the physical properties of speech sounds conveyed by bottom\u2010up signaling because it responded differentially to physically identical target sentences. Rather, the MTG was recruited when more abstract linguistic processing was enabled by a top\u2010down application of stored lexical\u2010semantic information stemming from the matching propositional prior. Indeed, the left MTG has been identified as a key region for semantic processing and meaning extraction [Binder et al.,  ; Price  ]. Activation of this area has been observed in various lexical\u2010semantic tasks ranging from comprehension of degraded sentences [e.g., Adank and Devlin,  ; Davis and Johnsrude,  ] to attempts to derive meaning from gestures supporting spoken speech [Dick et al.,  ; Hubbard et al.,  ]. In line with these findings, lesions of this region are associated with impairments in language comprehension [e.g., Dick et al.,  ; Dronkers et al.,  ]. \n\nIn addition to the left MTG, also the AG in the left temporo\u2010parietal junction has frequently been associated with semantic processing [Binder et al.,  ]. The AG, which corresponds to the cytoarchitectonic areas PGa and PGp [Caspers et al.,  ], is considered to be a heteromodal association area with access to higher\u2010order concepts and long\u2010term memory. The left AG has been suggested to provide top\u2010down \u201csemantic constraints\u201d in language processing [Price,  ] and may thus facilitate meaning extraction from ambiguous sentences [Obleser and Kotz,  ]. Interestingly, Seghier et al.   found that such a function is most likely attributable to the medial or ventral portion of the AG which corresponds well to the AG cluster observed in the current study. Thus, the selective AG activation on correct trials might be the origin of top\u2010down signals mediating predictions that facilitate decoding of the degraded sentences and enabling correct match/nonmatch decisions based on lexical\u2010semantic content. While both left MTG and AG showed stronger activation when lexical\u2010semantic expectations were present and fulfilled, their specific contribution to the processing of the speech signal is probably not equivalent. The MTG has been proposed to be involved in mapping sound (represented in the STS) to meaning [which is thought to be distributed throughout the cortex; Hickok and Poeppel,  ] and thereby enabling comprehension of speech signals. \n\nThe left AG, on the other hand, is thought to be a hierarchically higher node [Binder et al.,  ] which aids language processing by top\u2010down modulation [Price,  ; Seghier et al.,  ]. Potentially, this top\u2010down influence might have been more pronounced on trials with clearer evidence that consequently could be answered correctly. Alternatively however, top\u2010down modulation originating in the AG might also have rendered the evidence clearer and might have been a precondition for correct match/nonmatch decisions. \n\nWhile the pattern of activation in the AG indicated that activity in this region is mainly linked with correct trials, we observed significant thalamic activation only in the supplementary analysis. This suggests that both correctly and incorrectly answered trials contributed to the observed thalamic activation but that limiting the analysis to the correct trials might have provided insufficient statistical power to detect the thalamic activation. The effect of excluding \u223c20% of trials in the main analysis may have manifested itself particularly in a small structure such as the thalamus, especially in combination with the cluster threshold we used. Indeed, the thalamic activation was significant in the main analysis, too, when slightly lowering the cluster\u2010forming threshold. Nonetheless, we think that the thalamic activity is an interesting finding that deserves closer attention. Presumably, this activation could be due to top\u2010down modulation of sensory processing by signals from temporal or frontal areas. Indeed, cortico\u2010thalamic feedback is known to influence thalamic responses to auditory stimulation by amplifying those sensory features that optimally represent the signal predicted by cortical areas and inhibit all other response features [Alitto and Usrey,  ; Suga et al.,  ]. Furthermore, based on patient studies associating thalamic lesions with language deficits, Nadeau and Crosson   proposed that thalamic nuclei can selectively gate and integrate the flow of lexical information between frontal and temporo\u2010parietal cortices and regulate the access to lexical information when semantic input is provided. More recent support for a thalamic involvement in language processing beyond the relay of auditory information has been found in electrophysiological studies implicating cortico\u2010thalamic networks in processing the semantic and syntactic features of spoken sentences [David et al.,  ; Wahl et al.,  ], in fMRI studies reporting stronger thalamic responses to normal compared to (unintelligible) prosodic speech [Kotz et al.,  ] and demonstrating a thalamic contribution to resolving ambiguity of linguistic input [Ketteler et al.,  ]. \n\nIn contrast to the left MTG, AG and (when considering all trials) the thalamus, the left IFG was selectively activated in response to mismatches between the target sentence and prior propositional information, i.e., when attempts to decode the degraded sentence based on the propositional prior failed. The activation was localized in a portion of the IFG that has been cytoarchitectonically defined as area 44/45 [Broca's region; Amunts et al.,  ] and is known to play a role in speech perception, in particular when speech is syntactically complex [Friederici,  ; Friederici et al.,  ]. This region, however, is not restricted to language processing but appears to be generally involved in the sequencing of spatiotemporal structures of various modalities including language, music and action [Fadiga et al.,  ]. Importantly, left IFG activation has also been associated with detecting incompatibility in speech and other hierarchically organized sequences [Embick et al.,  ; Friederici et al.,  ; Myers et al.,  ] which might be interpreted as prediction errors signaling the need for reanalysis to prevent misinterpretation [Christensen and Wallentin,  ; Novick et al.,  ; Price,  ]. Furthermore, Giraud et al.   highlighted the role of Broca's region for search of meaningful content in auditory input. Accordingly, the involvement of Broca's region in the \u201cpropositional prior\u201d network might arise from the potential meaningful content provided by nondegraded reference sentences compared to degraded ones. In line with the above reasoning, mismatches between the target and the preceding nondegraded sentence might have evoked even stronger activation in Broca's region because the incoming signal was incompatible with the expected sequence of auditory events while the presence of meaningful content was hard to determine. Of interest, activation of Broca's region has also been linked with effects of complexity and task difficulty [Fadiga et al.,  ]. The behavioral data indicated that trials with propositional mismatches were more difficult to discriminate than trials with propositional matches. However, this held also true for structural mismatches. Furthermore, the contrast between all mismatch and match trials demonstrated that in particular the pre\u2010SMA (in addition to the right insula and right IFG) was associated with the overall effect of the higher task difficulty and response conflict associated with mismatches. Therefore, we would suggest that the selective activation of Broca's region in response to propositional mismatches reflects its specific involvement in challenging linguistic tasks, namely when the presence of meaning is hard to determine (search for meaning in noise) and an attempt is made to decode this potential meaning (reanalysis and possibly prevention of misinterpretation). \n\nHowever, it should also be noted that Broca's region is a multifunctional area [see Rogalsky and Hickok,  , for a recent review]. The present study cannot definitively determine the exact mechanism reflected by the activation of Broca's region, and alternative accounts such as the phonological working\u2010memory function of Broca's region cannot completely be ruled out. Nonetheless, if Broca's region merely reflected the storage and inner rehearsal of auditory speech stimuli, the comparison of trials with propositional versus structural priors should not evoke activity in this region because these working\u2010memory processes are also required for matching decisions purely based on the prosodic speech stimuli. Therefore, it seems more likely that the recruitment of Broca's region is due to the influence of lexical\u2010semantic content provided by (particularly nonmatching) propositional priors on the subsequent processing of the target sentences, as this is the only aspect that distinguishes these conditions. \n\nWhile Broca's region thus showed higher sensitivity for mismatches with propositional priors, the left MTG and AG (or, when considering all trials, the left MTG and the left thalamus) were implicated in lexical\u2010semantic processing and meaning extraction by means of using prior information. When an informative propositional template is available, originally incomprehensible speech stimuli can be subjected to a more profound analysis. That is, prior exposure to the intelligible original sentence results in a dramatic change in the appraisal of a hitherto meaningless speech\u2010like auditory stimulus that can suddenly be perceived as a salient and meaningful sentence. Such an expectancy\u2010guided reappraisal of formerly noisy and meaningless sensory stimuli corresponds well to the notion of predictive coding which proposes that the brain actively participates in the perceptual process by anticipating upcoming events [Friston,  ; Rao and Ballard,  ]. This inferential process may result in striking effects of prior information on perception, even if the perceived stimuli are physically identical [Hunter et al.,  ]. \n\nConceptually, accounts of predictive coding in perception [Friston,  ; Rao and Ballard,  ] assert that sensory predictions are generated at each level of the cortical hierarchy based on integration of prior knowledge with neural activity from lower levels. These predictions are thought to be fed back to lower levels where they are compared to the actual neural activity representing the sensory data. Differences between predicted and observed information are fed forward to the hierarchically higher node as the prediction error. This prediction error, in turn, is used to optimize subsequent predictions, as it indicates the fit of the current priors. Therefore, when a prediction fits well with the incoming sensory data, potential ambiguities among the stimuli can be resolved because the perceptual alternatives are weighted by the predicted template. With regard to the current study, propositional templates could only be successfully employed for decoding a degraded target sentence when (1) the reference sentence was a nondegraded sentence (propositional prior) and (2) the target sentence matched that reference sentence. Presumably, interactions within a left\u2010hemispheric network including the AG and the MTG are an important generator of these lexical\u2010semantic predictions. Possibly, these predictions were sent to lower levels of the auditory processing hierarchy and potentially modified the response profile in the left thalamus. Alternatively, it is also possible that top\u2010down feedback from the AG affected the processing in the MTG such that sound could be successfully mapped to meaning, resulting in the percept of an intelligible sentence. The importance of these regions is supported by previous studies reporting involvement of left temporal areas in successful decoding of originally unintelligibly degraded speech stimuli [Eulitz and Hannemann,  ; Giraud et al.,  ; Hannemann et al.,  ]. In contrast, unsuccessful decoding attempts of target sentences following a mismatching propositional prior were selectively associated with activation of Broca's region. This could indicate that Broca's region contributes to speech perception by searching for meaningful content and comparing expected auditory sequences with the actual input. Consequently, activation of Broca's region might represent the prediction error when prior knowledge cannot be used to decode meaningful speech due to mismatches between propositional priors and degraded targets. Alternatively, the comparison between the predicted and the actual signal might also happen elsewhere in the brain. In this case, involvement of Broca's region could reflect the updating of the expectations to be generated. Finally, a response to these mismatches might also signal the need for reanalysis of the auditory sequence to prevent misinterpretation. This signal might then lead to a reduced involvement of the left MTG and AG in processing propositional mismatches. Thus, top\u2010down influences of Broca's region on the MTG in particular but also on the AG might be relevant for the perceptual phenomenon of sudden understanding of a heavily degraded sentence and, at the same time, the lack of comprehension when prior knowledge cannot be applied to such degraded input. However, the exact mechanisms cannot be determined with the current analysis but would ultimately require dynamic causal modeling or related approaches. \n\nAlthough we interpret our results within the framework of predictive coding, we do not claim that this framework is the only one that can account for the findings. Alternatively, it might also be warranted to refer to priming mechanisms to explain the recognition of degraded sentences by an exposure effect of the original stimulus. However, predictive coding is the more generic framework, encompassing all kinds of contextual effects on perception, ranging from subliminal priming to instructed expectations. Accordingly, we prefer to interpret our findings in the context of this more general model of brain function, although the current experiment did not aim to test the predictive\u2010coding account itself. \n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nThe current study demonstrated that, in line with the notion of predictive coding, prior information has a decisive effect on speech perception. In particular, the processing of degraded sentences, which were incomprehensible when heard in isolation, was shown to be sensitive to the availability of memory templates (\u201cpriors\u201d) carrying propositional (i.e., lexical\u2010semantic) information. It may be assumed that this effect results from a combination of direct meaning decoding, based on lexical\u2010semantic predictions, and meaning retrieval, based on a structural match with previous speech input. Prior propositional information also influenced the neural response to degraded sentences and hence revealed the neural correlates of these processes. Specifically, successful meaning extraction from degraded sentences based on prior information was associated with increased activity in the left MTG and AG. These areas are known to play a role in high\u2010level lexical\u2010semantic processing that presumably modulates more basic speech processing at lower levels including the thalamus. In contrast, unsuccessful decoding due to a misleading propositional prior was selectively associated with stronger activation of Broca's region which may reflect the search for relevant acoustic cues in auditory sequences as well as processing prediction errors, thereby potentially preventing misinterpretation. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: hbm22151-tbl-0001\n### Label: Table 1\nReference\tTarget\tCondition\nStructural prior\tStructural prior\tStructural prior\nDegraded sentence A\tDegraded sentence A\tStructural match\nDegraded sentence A\tDegraded sentence B\tStructural mismatch\nPropositional prior\tPropositional prior\tPropositional prior\nNondegraded sentence A\tDegraded sentence A\tPropositional match\nNondegraded sentence A\tDegraded sentence B\tPropositional mismatch\n### Caption\nOverview of conditions\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: hbm22151-tbl-0002\n### Label: Table 2\nRegion\tCytoarchitectonic area (percent overlap)\tx\ty\tz\tZ\u2010score\tCluster size\nEffect of propositional prior\tEffect of propositional prior\tEffect of propositional prior\tEffect of propositional prior\tEffect of propositional prior\tEffect of propositional prior\tEffect of propositional prior\nL IFG\tArea 44???

Though the striatum and DA transmission are thought to be essential for timekeeping, potential working memory (WM) and executive problems could also disrupt timing. \n\n\n## Methodology/Findings \n  \nThe present study addressed these issues by testing controls and PD volunteers \u2018on\u2019 and \u2018off\u2019 DA therapy as they underwent fMRI while performing a time-perception task. To distinguish systems associated with abnormalities in temporal and non-temporal processes, we separated brain activity during encoding and decision-making phases of a trial. Whereas both phases involved timekeeping, the encoding and decision phases emphasized WM and executive processes, respectively. The methods enabled exploration of both the amplitude and temporal dynamics of neural activity. First, we found that time-perception deficits were associated with striatal, cortical, and cerebellar dysfunction. Unlike studies of timed movement, our results could not be attributed to traditional roles of the striatum and cerebellum in movement. Second, for the first time we identified temporal and non-temporal sources of impaired time perception. Striatal dysfunction was found during both phases consistent with its role in timekeeping. Activation was also abnormal in a WM network (middle-frontal and parietal cortex, lateral cerebellum) during encoding and a network that modulates executive and memory functions (parahippocampus, posterior cingulate) during decision making. Third, hypoactivation typified neuronal dysfunction in PD, but was sometimes characterized by abnormal temporal dynamics (e.g., lagged, prolonged) that were not due to longer response times. Finally, DA therapy did not alleviate timing deficits. \n\n\n## Conclusions/Significance \n  \nOur findings indicate that impaired timing in PD arises from nigrostriatal and mesocortical dysfunction in systems that mediate temporal and non-temporal control-processes. However, time perception impairments were not improved by DA treatment, likely due to inadequate restoration of neuronal activity and perhaps corticostriatal effective-connectivity. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTiming is a process that helps structure perception, cognition and movement. Prevailing models emphasize the role of the striatum and dopamine (DA) neurotransmission  ,   in regulating an internal clock that generates pulses and an accumulator that counts pulses, thereby representing perceived duration. The experience of time, however, can be dilated or compressed by working memory (WM), attention, and decisional processes  , which are cortically driven. Thus, timing emerges from interactions among multiple processes that are intertwined. When timing is disentangled from other processes, the striatum is closely linked to timing, whereas the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the middle-frontal and inferior parietal cortices are more associated with WM and executive processes, respectively  . \n\nThe basal ganglia's role in timing is particularly relevant to individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), who exhibit temporal processing deficits  \u2013 . Timing deficits may contribute to the breakdown in the spatiotemporal patterning of movements in PD, which benefit from external rhythmic sensory-cueing  . The neuronal sources of timing impairments in PD and their response to DA therapy are not well understood. Whether DA therapy improves timing deficits is controversial  \u2013 ,  \u2013 . To date, three fMRI and one PET study of timing have been conducted in PD  \u2013 . Only two of these studies examined the effect of DA treatment  ,  , and all studied timed movements, so that it was not possible to distinguish abnormal activation in systems classically associated with motor-control (i.e., basal ganglia, cerebellum) from activity related to temporal processing. \n\nThe present study addressed these issues by testing PD participants \u2018on\u2019 and \u2018off\u2019 their DA therapy as they underwent fMRI while performing a time-perception task. In this task, a standard interval (SI) and a comparison interval (CI) were successively encoded, followed by a decision about their relative duration. To identify neural systems related to different components of temporal processing, we separated brain activation associated with encoding the SI and holding it in WM from activation associated with encoding the CI and making a decision. We reasoned that the encoding phase would emphasize timekeeping, but also WM maintenance. Whereas the decision phase engages timekeeping as well, executive processes involved in updating WM and comparing information is also emphasized during this period  ,  ,  . We predicted that abnormal basal ganglia activation in PD would be seen during both phases if the striatum is critical for timekeeping. As SMA dysfunction is common in PD, we also expected abnormal activation during both phases if the SMA plays a key role in timekeeping  . Finally, we predicted abnormal middle-frontal cortex activation during the decision, but not the encoding phase if executive difficulties  ,   contribute to timing deficits in PD. To determine if the cognitive-control systems emphasized by the two phases respond differently to DA therapy  , we studied the effects of medication on brain activation and on striatal interactions with the cortex and cerebellum (i.e., effective connectivity). Though DA therapy was expected to improve striatal function, its effects on key cortical regions that support time perception (e.g., SMA, middle-frontal and inferior-parietal cortex) are unclear as this has not been previously studied. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants and Procedures \n  \nParticipants included 21 volunteers with idiopathic PD (14 males, 7 females) and 19 healthy adults (12 males, 7 females). Age and education were balanced between the groups ( ). Subjects were excluded if they had metal in their body, exhibited signs of dementia on a global dementia screening battery (Mini-Mental Status Exam score <25) and on neuropsychological tests of cognitive speed/flexibility, working memory span, and sustained attention (i.e., \u22651.5 standard deviations (SD) below the control group;  ), exhibited signs of depression (Geriatric Depression Score \u226510), or had a medical history of neurological diagnoses other than PD, severe psychiatric disorders (DSM-IV), diabetes, and alcohol or substance abuse. PD volunteers were excluded if they had axial tremors or dyskinesias that could cause head movement during scanning, or if they were taking cholinesterase inhibitors or neuroleptic medications. ANOVAs showed no group differences on neuropsychological tests of global dementia, cognitive speed/flexibility, verbal and spatial working memory, sustained attention and maximum tapping speed ( ). \n   Demographics, neuropsychological test performance  , and structural MRI volumes for the Control and Parkinson's groups.        \nBoard-certified neurologists with a specialty in motor disorders assessed all PD participants (D.D. Song and S. Lessig). PD participants exhibited at least two of the three cardinal features of the disorder (i.e., bradykinesia, resting tremor, motor rigidity), were levodopa responsive, and did not exhibit features of progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, multiple systems atrophy, or dementia. Eighteen PD participants were taking levodopa/carbidopa, and all were taking one or more DA agonists or releasers. The mean levodopa equivalence (LDE) was 748.3 (SD \u200a=\u200a 428)  . Symptoms on the motor examination section of the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) were worse off [Mean (SD) \u200a=\u200a 29.6 (10.4)] than on medication [Mean (SD) \u200a=\u200a 22.2 (8.0)] [F(1, 20)\u200a=\u200a20.9, p<.0001, \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a.51]. On the Hoehn and Yahr, 18 and 3 PD participants were stage 2 and 3, respectively, both off and on medication. \n\nPD participants completed two fMRI sessions that were conducted on separate days at the same time of day. For one fMRI session, PD volunteers took their normal daily medication dosage one hour before scanning (ON condition) so that they were studied in an optimally medicated state. In the other fMRI session, participants refrained from taking medication for at least 2 half-lives of the longest acting medication or a minimum of 16 to 24 hours before the scan (OFF condition) so that they were studied in a \u2018practical\u2019 off state. The control subjects performed the fMRI task once in the scanner and once in the laboratory; only behavioral data from the scanning session were analyzed. For both groups, the order of testing conditions was counterbalanced. The study was approved by the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Human Research Protections Program (HRPP). Study participants signed written informed-consent forms. \n\n\n### Functional MRI \n  \n#### fMRI task \n  \nIn the time perception task ( ), subjects attended to the duration of successively presented pairs of filled-auditory or visual stimuli, and then judged whether the second stimulus was shorter or longer than the first. Throughout the experiment, the subject maintained fixation on a white cross at the center of the display. One second before trial onset, a warning signal (i.e., flashing yellow cross and mixed 700-Hz tone) appeared for 500 ms followed by a 500 ms delay. Trial onset began with presentation of an auditory (1000 Hz pure tone) or visual (blue circle) SI that lasted 1200 or 1800 ms, and was respectively followed by a 6800 or 6200 ms delay. Then a CI of the same modality was presented, after which the subject indicated if it was shorter or longer than the SI by pressing a key with the right index or middle finger. For each SI, there were 3 shorter and 3 longer CIs that differed from the SI by successive increments of \u00b17%. Two SIs were used to help ensure that subjects encoded signal duration on each trial. The analyses collapsed across SI duration. The analyses also collapsed across signal modality, as there were no group differences in timing auditory and visual signals (see   section), consistent with other reports  . Accuracy and reaction time (RT; from offset of the CI to key press) were measured. We did not include a sensorimotor control task since processing in sensory areas was of interest to our study. \n   Time perception paradigm and task performance.  \nA) Trial events for the auditory and visual conditions of the time perception task. Trials were preceded by a 500 ms warning signal (i.e., flashing yellow fixation cross and a mixed 700 Hz auditory tone). At trial onset, an auditory or visual standard-interval (SI) (1200 or 1800 ms) was presented and followed by a delay (6800 or 6200 ms). At 8 s post-trial onset, a comparison interval (CI) of the same modality was presented. Image acquisition (TR \u200a=\u200a 2 s) was pegged to the onsets on the SI and CI. The first 12 s of a trial (i.e., equivalent to 6 TRs) constituted the   encoding phase  . The last 12 s of a trial constituted the   decision phase.   B  ) Mean (standard error bars) accuracy for the auditory (left) and visual (right) conditions in the control group and PD OFF and ON conditions. Accuracy data were converted to the mean percent longer, and averaged across the two SI conditions and their respective CIs. On the x axis, \u00b17, 14, and 21 designate CIs that were 7%, 14%, and 21% shorter (negative values) or longer (positive values) than the SI. \n  \nThere were 30 trials per SI condition (i.e., auditory 1200 ms, auditory 1800 ms, visual 1200 ms, and visual 1800 ms), with 5 trials per CI for a total of 120 trials. Trials were divided into 8 runs of 15 trials each. Within a run, SI conditions were randomly presented. Image acquisition was synchronized with the onset of the SI and the CI. Each trial included a minimum of 9 images (i.e., 18 s) to reduce the likelihood of nonlinear summing of overlapping hemodynamic responses. Additional one to five \u2018filler\u2019 2.0 s epochs (fixation cross) were randomly added to the end of each trail (i.e., 45 filler images per run). Jitter in the inter-trial interval allowed for the best sampling of the hemodynamic response and establishment of a baseline resting state in the model (i.e., fixation plus ambient scanner noise). A run began and ended with 5 additional filler images to respectively allow for T1 equilibration and the delayed hemodynamic response of the final trial. Each run consisted of 190 images acquired over 6 min and 20 s. \n\n\n#### Image acquisition \n  \nImaging was conducted at the UCSD Center for FMRI using a GE 3-T Excite MRI system equipped with an 8-channel head-coil. Whole-brain blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) weighted echo-planar images were acquired using a single-shot, blipped, gradient-echo echo-planar pulse sequence (TE\u200a=\u200a 30 ms, TR\u200a=\u200a 2.0 s, 90\u00b0 flip angle, FOV\u200a=\u200a24 cm, resolution \u200a=\u200a 64\u00d764). Thirty-seven contiguous, axial 4-mm slices (3.75\u00d73.75\u00d74-mm voxel size) provided whole-brain coverage. High-resolution T1-weighted anatomic images were collected for anatomic localization (3D spoiled gradient-recalled at steady-state, TE\u200a=\u200a3.0 ms, TR\u200a=\u200a7.8 ms, 12\u00b0 flip angle, number of excitations (NEX) \u200a=\u200a 1, 1-mm slice thickness, FOV\u200a=\u200a25 cm, resolution \u200a=\u200a 256\u00d7256). Foam padding was used to limit head motion. Auditory stimuli were delivered binaurally through a headphone that together with earplugs attenuated background scanner noise by about 40 db. Visual stimuli were viewed through a mirror mounted on the head-coil. \n\n\n#### Image analysis \n  \nFunctional images were generated using Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) software. Time series images were spatially registered in 3-dimensional space and corrected for time-slice acquisition differences. A deconvolution analysis (correcting for scanner drift) was used to generate impulse response functions (IRFs) of the fMRI signal on a voxelwise basis. Each IRF was estimated relative to the baseline state (i.e., filler images), without a priori assumptions about the shape, delay, or magnitude of the IRF. Six head-motion parameters were included as covariates of no interest. Estimates of percent signal change (PSC) for each image acquired 0 s to 24 s post-stimulus onset were then calculated by taking the beta coefficient and dividing it by the model intercept. The PSC maps were interpolated to volumes with 1-mm  voxels, co-registered, converted to Talairach coordinate-space, and blurred using a 4-mm Gaussian root mean square filter. \n\n\n#### Spatial extent analysis \n  \nThis analysis examined the within-group spatial extent of activation. For each group (control, PD ON, PD OFF), statistical parametric maps were generated to identify voxels that exhibited a significant change in activation (i.e., PSC estimates) during each phase of the trial.   shows that the first 12 s of a trial (i.e., 6 TRs) constituted the   encoding phase  , during which the subject encoded the SI and held it in memory; the last 12 s constituted the   decision phase  , wherein the subject encoded the CI and judged its duration relative to the SI. Repeated-measures ANOVAs for each group tested the effect of time (i.e., 6 TRs for each phase), separately for the encoding and decision phases of a trial. Voxelwise thresholds were derived from 3,000 Monte Carlo simulations (AFNI AlphaSim), which computed the voxel probability and minimum cluster-size threshold needed to obtain a .05 familywise alpha. Because spatial thresholds are biased against smaller activation clusters of a priori interest (i.e., basal ganglia and midbrain nuclei), statistical thresholds were derived separately for basal ganglia/midbrain and cortical volumes  . This was accomplished by creating a basal ganglia/midbrain mask (i.e., claustrum, putamen, globus pallidus (GP), caudate, substantia nigra (SN), red nucleus, and subthalamic nucleus) using the Talairach Daemon dataset; the mask was then expanded to include any voxels within a 2 mm radius. The cortical mask included all other regions of the brain including the cerebellum. Each mask was used in the Monte Carlo simulations to determine the appropriate combination of individual voxel-probability and minimum cluster-size threshold. For the basal ganglia/midbrain volume, a voxelwise threshold of p<.008 and a minimum cluster size of .225 ml yielded a .05 familywise alpha. For the cortical volume, a voxelwise threshold of p<.004 and a minimum cluster size of .338 ml yielded a .05 familywise alpha. \n\n\n#### Functional region of interest analysis \n  \nA functional region of interest (fROI) analysis was conducted to evaluate potential group differences. A fROI map was generated by conjoining activated regions identified in the above spatial extent analyses across the control group and the PD ON and OFF conditions. Thus, any voxel significantly activated in at least one of the groups or conditions contributed to the final fROI map. Two conjunctive maps were generated, one for the encoding and one for the decision phase. Masks from the Talairach Daemon dataset were then used to separate large clusters into functionally relevant regions, which were the basis for all subsequent analyses. \n\nRather than focusing exclusively on peak activation, we analyzed group differences in the temporal dynamics or evolution of brain activity, since this might better characterize neuronal functioning as it does in normal aging  . This approach also avoided problems with assuming equivalence among regions in the time delay of hemodynamic responses to an event  . We first compared fROI between the control group and the OFF condition to evaluate the effects of disease on activation. The 2 (group; G) X 6 (time; T, where T  \u200a=\u200a the first 6 TRs and T  \u200a=\u200a the last 6 TRs of a trial) mixed-model ANOVA tested for the main effect of group (G) and its interaction with time (G X T), separately for the encoding and the decision phases. Next, regions that showed significant group effects were compared between the OFF and ON conditions to evaluate medication effects. The 2 (medication condition; Med) X 6 (T) repeated-measures ANOVA tested the main effect of medication condition (Med) and its interaction with time (Med X T), separately for the encoding and decision phases. If medication had an effect, mixed-model ANOVAs compared the ON condition with the control group to determine if DA normalized activation. The significance threshold was set at p<.03 for the cortical volumes and at p<.05 for the basal ganglia/midbrain volumes as the latter involved far fewer comparisons. The Huynh-Feldt correction adjusted for heterogeneity of variance in multiple degrees-of-freedom tests. \n\n\n#### Effective connectivity analysis \n  \nIn addition to the univariate tests that assessed the effect of medication on activation of individual fROI, we also asked if DA therapy altered interactions of the striatum with the cortex and cerebellum. This was achieved by conducting voxel-based tests of psychophysiological interactions (PPI) separately for the encoding and decision phases  . Voxels in the bilateral caudate and putamen, which showed abnormal activation OFF medication, were the seed ROI and were selected for each subject using the conjunctive maps generated for the fROI analyses. The experimental variable was medication state (ON, OFF). Multiplication of the deconvolved time series for the seed areas with the experimental variable formed the interaction term (i.e., PPI regressor), which tested whether connectivity of the striatum with the whole brain was modulated by medication. A p<.005 voxelwise threshold and a .225 ml minimum cluster size was the criterion for significance. \n\n\n\n### Structural MRI Analysis \n  \nTo assess group differences in striatal, cerebral, and cerebellar volume, automated cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation of T1-weighted images was performed using FreeSurfer ( ), which is a vertex-based approach. Processing included removal of non-brain tissue using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure   and transformation to Talairach space. This was followed by segmentation of subcortical white- and deep gray-matter volumetric structures  , intensity normalization  , tessellation of the gray-white matter boundary, automated topology correction  ,  , and surface deformation following intensity gradients to optimally place the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to the other tissue class  . Transformation and segmentations were manually verified. This approach provides anatomically accurate renderings of regional volumes, without potential rater bias  . To account for differences in head size, volumes were divided by estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV).   shows that striatum and cerebral/cerebellar gray-matter volumes did not differ between groups (p values >.05). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### fMRI Task Performance \n  \nAccuracy was converted to the percent longer responses for each CI, per convention. CIs that were increments of \u00b17%, 14% or 21% shorter/longer than the SI were averaged across the SI conditions. A mixed-model ANOVA compared the control group with the OFF condition, testing the main effect of group, modality (audition, vision), CI, and the interactions. The group X CI interaction [F(3.6,137.6)\u200a=\u200a3.8, p<.005] was due to worse performance (i.e., flatter slope, lower accuracy) in the OFF condition than in the control group ( ). The modality X CI interaction [F(5,190)\u200a=\u200a2.3, p<.05] indicated that performance was worse for visual than auditory intervals in both groups. No other significant effects were found. The OFF and ON conditions were then compared. The repeated-measures ANOVA showed no effect of medication on performance, irrespective of modality. This was consistent with a mixed-model ANOVA comparing the control group with the ON condition, which showed a group X CI interaction [F(3.2,121)\u200a=\u200a3.4, p<.02]. No other group effects were found. As for RTs, group and medication effects were not significant (Mean (SE): Controls \u200a=\u200a 2316 ms (68); OFF \u200a=\u200a 2322 ms (65); ON \u200a=\u200a 2404 ms (74)). However, RTs were longer for visual (Mean (SE) \u200a=\u200a 2390 ms (54)) than auditory intervals (Mean (SE) \u200a=\u200a 2292 ms (54) in both groups [F1,38)\u200a=\u200a7.0, p<.01]. \n\n\n### fMRI Spatial Extent Analysis \n  \nDescriptive analyses of the spatial extent of activation indicated that total volume of activation was reduced in both phases by approximately 28% in the PD OFF group relative to the controls. Frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe volumes were reduced 15% to 20% in the OFF group, irrespective of phase. However,   shows that for both phases volume reductions of more than 25% were seen OFF medication in the bilateral preSMA/SMA/cingulate (33% for both phases), thalamus (36% to 39%), striatum (27% to 30%), midbrain nuclei (27% to 30%), parahippocampus (83% to 85%), occipital lobe (39% to 49%), and cerebellum (65% for both phases). Whereas medication appeared to increase activation extent,   shows that the spatial extent of activation typically remained lower relative to the control group (see   and   for activation volumes in the whole brain, and   and   for details about activation foci). \n   Spatial extent of activation in areas showing reduced volumes in the PD OFF condition.  \nActivation volumes for the left and right hemispheres combined are displayed for the encoding and decision phases in the C (red bars), PD OFF (black bars) and PD ON (grey bars) groups. Areas are displayed that showed reduced volumes of more than 25 percent in the PD OFF condition relative to the control (C) group. See   and   for activation volumes in the whole brain, and   and   for details about activation foci. \n  \n\n### Functional ROI Analysis \n  \nThe conjoined fMRI activation-masks in   show that similar regions of activation were found during both phases of the trial (see   for details about activation foci).   also shows that group differences were found in only a subset of these regions (i.e., yellow), and were partially related to the behavioral context. For example, the PD OFF group exhibited abnormal preSMA/SMA/cingulate, precentral, middle-frontal, parietal, insula, inferior-temporal, right-parahippocampus, and lateral-cerebellum activation during the encoding phase. In contrast, posterior-cingulate and left-parahippocampus activations were abnormal during the decision phase. Only the striatum and vermis exhibited abnormal activation during both phases. We now turn to the statistical analyses in support of these observations. \n   Functional ROI for the encoding (A) and decision phases (B).  \nFunctional ROIs were derived from conjoining activation maps in   and  , respectively. Yellow regions designate significant group (Control vs. PD OFF) differences in activation; red regions indicate no significant group differences. Brain activation is projected onto the lateral and medial surfaces of the left and right hemispheres (rows 1 and 2), the anterior and posterior surfaces of the cerebellum (row 3), and the left and right basal ganglia (row 4). See   for details about individual fROI. \n  \n#### Encoding phase: PD OFF versus control \n  \n lists regions wherein activation during interval encoding differed between the control and PD OFF groups, and   displays activation time-courses in representative regions for the first half of the hemodynamic response (i.e., encoding period). This figure shows that hemodynamic responses return to baseline in some fROI, but not in others because the trial extends beyond the encoding of the SI, including activity related to WM maintenance. In all regions, the temporal dynamics of activation differed between the groups (G X T). In the striatum, hemodynamic responses were attenuated and temporally lagged OFF medication relative to controls. Hemodynamic responses were also attenuated OFF medication and returned to baseline levels soon after peak activation in left preSMA/SMA/cingulate, left precentral gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyrus, left inferior-temporal cortex, and right insula; by comparison, activation in the control group was robust for longer periods. In contrast, right middle-frontal gyrus (MFG), left inferior-parietal cortex, and bilateral lateral cerebellar activity was attenuated OFF medication and prolonged relative to the control group. Moreover, no significant activation was seen OFF medication in the right parahippocampus and vermis. \n   Percent signal change in regions showing abnormal activation OFF medication during the encoding phase.  \nGraphs display representative regions showing different time courses of activation between the control (red lines) and PD OFF (black lines) groups (G X T). The effect of medication is also shown (PD ON; gray lines). The abscissa designates the time (sec) post-trial onset. The mean (standard error bars) percent signal change (PSC) is graphed for the first half of the hemodynamic response (i.e., encoding period). Bracketed numbers reference regions detailed in  . B \u200a=\u200a bilateral hemispheres; L \u200a=\u200a left hemisphere; R \u200a=\u200a right hemisphere; SMA \u200a=\u200a supplementary motor area. \n     Regions showing significant group and medication effects during the encoding phase.        \n\n#### Encoding phase: Medication \n  \n and   show that medication altered activation in the right parahippocampus, the right insula and the vermis (Med X T). In all three regions, comparisons between the ON and the control groups indicated that medication normalized activation. \n\n\n#### Decision phase: PD OFF versus control \n  \n and   show regions wherein the temporal dynamics of activation during decision making differed between the controls and the OFF condition (G X T). In bilateral putamen, peak activation was normal, but prolonged relative to controls. In bilateral caudate, peak activation was lagged, attenuated and prolonged relative to controls. No significant activation was seen in the posterior cingulate and the left parahippocampus, and there was only a trend (p<.05) for vermis activation; these results contrasted with significant activation in the control group in all three regions. No other group differences were found. \n   Percent signal change in regions showing abnormal activation OFF medication during the decision phase.  \nGraphs display regions showing different time courses of activation between the control (red lines) and PD OFF (black lines) groups (G X T) during the decision phase. The effect of medication is also shown (PD ON; gray lines). The abscissa designates the time (sec) post-trial onset. The mean (standard error bars) percent signal change (PSC) is graphed for the second half of the hemodynamic response (i.e., decision phase). Bracketed numbers reference regions detailed in  . B \u200a=\u200a bilateral hemispheres; L \u200a=\u200a left hemisphere; R \u200a=\u200a right hemisphere; GP \u200a=\u200a globus pallidus. \n     Regions showing significant group and medication effects during the decision phase.        \n\n#### Decision phase: Medication \n  \n and   show that medication altered activation time-courses only in the bilateral putamen and vermis. Medication significantly attenuated the prolonged time-courses of putamen activity, but did not normalize activation relative to the control group (G X T: p<.025). In contrast, medication enhanced and normalized vermis activity. \n\n\n\n### Effective Connectivity Analysis \n  \nEffective connectivity analyses showed that interactions of the striatum with the cortex were modulated by DA therapy, but only in the decision phase.   and   show that DA therapy significantly modulated interactions between the striatum and the cortex (i.e., SMA, precentral and postcentral gyrus, superior frontal gyrus (SFG), MFG, superior and inferior parietal cortex, precuneus, and insula), but not the cerebellum.   graphs representative PPI.

First, impaired time perception OFF medication was associated with abnormal activation in systems regularly associated with time perception in studies of healthy adults  ,  ,  \u2013  including the striatum, selected cortical sites (e.g., preSMA/SMA, cingulate gyrus, precentral and postcentral gyri, insula, middle-frontal and inferior-parietal cortex, parahippocampus) and the cerebellum (lobules, vermis). Unlike studies of timed movement, our results could not be attributed to classic motor-control functions of the basal ganglia or the cerebellum. Second, for the first time we were able to better distinguish temporal and non-temporal sources of cognitive dysfunction in time perception by separating activity during the encoding and decision phases. Our finding of striatal dysfunction in both phases was consistent with the role of DA neurotransmission in timekeeping operations. In addition, our results suggested that non-temporal operations emphasized by each phase were also disrupted in PD. Specifically, activation was abnormal in a classic WM network (middle frontal-inferior parietal, SMA, lateral cerebellum) during the encoding phase, whereas activation was absent in a network that mediates executive processes and memory (posterior-cingulate, parahippocampus) during the decision phase. Third, another novel finding was that neuronal dysfunction in PD was sometimes characterized by abnormal temporal dynamics. For example, hemodynamic responses of the striatum were typically attenuated, but also temporally lagged and sometimes prolonged; activity was also prolonged in a WM network (middle frontal-inferior parietal cortex, lateral cerebellar). These findings cannot be explained by longer RTs in PD, which did not differ from the control group. Fourth, DA therapy did not alleviate time perception deficits, despite its robust benefit on motor symptoms (UPDRS). Our fMRI results suggested that this was likely due to insufficient restoration of neuronal activation and perhaps corticostriatal effective-connectivity. We now discuss these findings more completely. \n\n### Striatal Dysfunction in PD \n  \nAs predicted, striatal activation OFF medication was abnormal during both phases of a trial, consistent with its role in timekeeping. During interval encoding, attenuated and temporally lagged striatal activity may suggest weakened and delayed processing of input from multiple corticostriatal loops. Theoretically, weakened and lagged striatal activation should disrupt integration of cortical input over time, a key function of the \u2018core timer.\u2019 Specifically, by the striatal beat frequency (SBF) model, sensory input is translated into cortical oscillatory patterns, which support the clock signal, and striatal medium-spiny neurons serve as a core timer by detecting and integrating oscillatory states over time  . Thus, impaired time perception in PD may be partially related to deficient striatal integration of cortical input. This may be due to diminished nigrostriatal phasic-DA, which it thought to signal the onset and offset of a to-be-timed event  . \n\nWe also found striatal dysfunction during the decision phase, wherein peak activation of the putamen/GP was normal in PD, yet sustained longer relative to the control group; caudate activity was also sustained, but temporally lagged and attenuated. Although both phases involve timekeeping, the duration of two intervals is compared only during the decision phase. Sustained striatal activity leads us to speculate that it reflects compensation for difficulties in additional processes including updating WM with the CI   and comparing it with the SI. These processes require fast, flexible striatal-reactions, which are our study shows are temporally lagged and sometimes prolonged in PD during decision making and may be a basis for cognitive inflexibility  . \n\n\n### Disease-Related Cortical and Cerebellar Activity \n  \nTime perception impairments OFF medication were also associated with abnormal cortical and cerebellar activity. A unique finding was that these abnormalities partially depended on the context, despite activation of similar regions in both phases (  and   for details about activation foci for each phase). During the encoding phase, hypoactivation was found in the cerebellum (lobules, vermis) and cortical areas of the motor (preSMA/SMA/cingulate, precentral/postcentral gyrus), executive (middle-frontal, inferior parietal), and limbic (parahippocampus, insula, inferior temporal) corticostriatal loops  . In the motor loop, preSMA/SMA dysfunction only during encoding was notable as it is at odds with a fundamental role for the SMA in timekeeping  . SMA dysfunction is common in PD and is traditionally attributed to difficulties with internally-generated behaviors. However, a more pivotal distinction may relate to its role in WM, specifically online storage of output from the motor pathway  ,  . By this proposal, SMA dysfunction in PD should be manifested particularly when maintenance is emphasized, as during the encoding phase wherein the SI is held in memory for over 6 s. \n\nMemory-related difficulties during interval encoding were also suggested by PD participants' prolonged activation in a classic WM-network (middle-frontal, precentral, inferior-parietal, lateral cerebellum)  . This may suggest \u2018compensatory processing\u2019 for diminished preSMA/SMA functioning, but perhaps also for hypoactivity of the insular cortex, which has efferent connections to WM networks and the striatum  . The insula integrates processing from disparate domains (e.g., interoception, emotion, WM) including time  ,  ,  ,  ,  . Recent models suggest that the insula is an attentional \u2018hub\u2019 that assists central executive networks in generating accurate responses to salient or task-relevant events  ,  . In our study, insula dysfunction may be manifested during interval encoding due to uncertainty about the to-be-attended modality at trial onset, which accentuates attentional demands. This prospect is compatible with normal insula activation during the decision phase, wherein top-down attention mechanisms might enhance insula activation since the CI modality is certain as it always matches the SI. Memory-related deficits OFF therapy were further evidenced in the encoding phase by the striking absence of activity in the right parahippocampus, damage to which disrupts time perception  . \n\nCortical dysfunction during the decision phase was unexpectedly confined to a medial \u2018default-mode network\u2019 (left parahippocampus, bilateral posterior cingulate)  . Activation was absent in this network OFF medication, in contrast to the control group. To our knowledge, parahippocampus dysfunction has not been reported in non-demented PD, whereas evidence for posterior-cingulate dysfunction remains debated  \u2013 . We speculate that abnormal functioning of this network emerged during decision making due to the emphasis on executive processes (e.g., comparison of the SI and CI) and/or retrieval, which are modulated by this system  . Together with the absence of activity in the right parahippocampus during the encoding phase, deficient functioning of this network may underlie distortions in memory for time in PD  , and may be an early marker of memory problems. \n\nIt was notable that vermis activity was greatly reduced OFF medication during both phases, as was lateral cerebellar activity during encoding. Our results contrast with cerebellar hyperactivity in PD during timed movements  \u2013 , which is attributed to compensation for striatal dysfunction. Although direct support for this proposal is lacking, hyperactivity of the cerebellum during timed movement, but not time perception may reflect an increased reliance on sensorimotor-coordination functions of the cerebellum, rather than purported timekeeping functions  . \n\n\n### Dopamine Modulation of Brain Activation and Corticostriatal Connectivity \n  \nOur results showed that DA therapy did not alleviate time perception deficits, consistent with some  , but not all studies  ,  ,  . At first glance our results seem to conflict with the effects of DA agonists and antagonists on timing in animals  . However, our fMRI findings suggest that time perception does not benefit from DA therapy when activity is not sufficiently reinstated in timekeeping and non-temporal control systems known to mediate time perception. Specifically, during the encoding phase, treatment did not alter activation in the striatum or a WM network (SMA, middle frontal-inferior parietal cortex, lateral cerebellum), nor did it affect interactions of the striatum with other brain areas (effective connectivity). Likewise, during the decision phase impoverished activity in the default mode network (posterior cingulate, left parahippocampus) was not improved by DA therapy, nor was activity in the caudate, which interacts with this network  . \n\nThere were some benefits of medication on brain activation, but they were circumscribed. During the encoding phase, treatment normalized attenuated limbic system (right insula and right parahippocampus) and vermis activity, possibly via the mesocortical-DA system. During the decision phase, DA therapy normalized vermis activity and improved, but did not restore the temporal dynamics of the putamen. Interestingly, DA therapy also mediated striatal interactions with the cortex, but not the cerebellum. Two patterns of effective connectivity were found, consistent with a recent study of motor timing in PD  . First, the striatum showed greater connectivity OFF than ON medication with the MFG, SMA, precentral/postcentral cortex, insula, and parietal cortex. Enhanced connectivity OFF therapy might appear counterintuitive since corticostriatal connectivity can be reduced OFF medication relative to controls  . However, animal models suggest that enhanced connectivity after DA depletion may reflect excessive synchronicity in corticostriatal circuits  , which disrupts rapid, flexible updating/integration by the striatum in contexts that call for cognitive flexibility  , such as the decision phase. Second, we also found that the putamen showed greater connectivity ON than OFF medication with the left SFG. Enhanced connectivity ON medication could reflect reduced inhibitory output from the striatum to an area that normally supports temporal decision-making  ,  . These speculations require further research as mechanisms of effective-connectivity in PD and their regulation by DA are not understood. Altogether, our finding of DA-mediated striatal activation and connectivity only during the decision phase is consistent with its effects on flexibility control-mechanisms, which are driven by the striatum and nigrostriatal DA  . Nevertheless, functioning is not restored in networks important for time perception. \n\n\n### Summary \n  \nThe present results illuminated the neurobehavioral mechanisms of time perception deficits in PD by distinguishing abnormal activity in the encoding and decision phases of a trial, which we hypothesized would both engage timekeeping, but accentuate demands on different non-temporal control processes. As predicted, neuronal dysfunction was found in a purported timekeeping center (striatum) in both phases. In addition, neuronal dysfunction in the encoding and decision phases was respectively manifested in WM/attentional (SMA, middle-frontal and inferior-parietal cortex, lateral cerebellum, insula, right parahippocampus) and executive processing/memory (left parahippocampus, bilateral posterior cingulate) centers. The temporal dynamics of activation in PD were also abnormal in the striatum and a frontoparietal-cerebellar network, which better characterized the basis for disturbances in timekeeping (temporally lagged and/or prolonged) and WM (prolonged). However, DA therapy did not alleviate time perception deficits in PD. Our fMRI results suggested that restoration of neuronal functioning was insufficient, possibly due to largely tonic effects of treatment, which fail to restore the balance of phasic and tonic DA in nigrostriatal and mesocortical pathways  . \n\n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone-0017461-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nVariables\tControl (n\u200a=\u200a19)\tControl (n\u200a=\u200a19)\tParkinson's (n\u200a=\u200a21)\tParkinson's (n\u200a=\u200a21)\tUnnamed: 5_level_0\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tM\tSD\tM\tSD\tP\nDemographics\t\t\t\t\t\nAge\t64.6\t8.5\t67.0\t9.4\t0.4\nEducation\t17.1\t2.7\t15.9\t2.8\t0.2\nMini-Mental State Exam???\t28.6\t1.1\t28.7\t1.6\t0.87\nCognitive Speed/Flexibility???\t\t\t\t\t\nTrails A\t48.4\t9.9\t46.1\t7.5\t0.33\nTrials B\t53.1\t10.8\t48.3\t7.5\t0.08\nWorking Memory Span???\t\t\t\t\t\nDigits Forward/Backward\t13.2\t2.4\t12.4\t3.5\t0.1\nSpatial Span Forward\t11.1\t3.3\t9.5\t2.4\t0.1\nSpatial Span Backward\t14.2\t2.3\t13.2\t2.5\t0.2\nSustained Attention???\t\t\t\t\t\nDigit Vigilance Test\t49.9\t9.7\t52.1\t11.8\t0.57\nMotor Speed???\t\t\t\t\t\nFinger Tapping (right hand)\t50.0\t8.4\t45.0\t10.2\t0.41\nStructural MRI volumes???\t\t\t\t\t\nBilateral putamen, GP\t0.9\t0.1\t0.9\t0.1\t0.9\nBilateral caudate\t0.5\t0.1\t0.5\t0.1\t0.1\nTotal Cortical Gray\t28.1\t1.4\t27.0\t2.6\t0.09\nTotal Cerebellar Gray\t6.2\t0.8\t6.3\t0.8\t0.78\n### Caption\nDemographics, neuropsychological test performance 1, and structural MRI volumes for the Control and Parkinson's groups.\n### Footer\n1Neuropsychological testing was conducted in PD participants when they were taking their medication.2The total score (maximum \u200a=\u200a 30) is reported for the Mini-Mental State Exam [57].3T-scores are reported for the Trail Making Test [58].4Scaled scores are reported for the Digit Span and Spatial Span tests [59].5T-scores are reported for the Digit Vigilance Test [60].6T-scores for the dominant right hand are reported for the Finger Tapping Test [58].7Volumes are expressed as the percentage of estimated total intracranial volume (volume/eTIV).\n\n\n## ID: pone-0017461-t002\n### Label: Table 2\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tUnnamed: 1_level_0\tUnnamed: 2_level_0\tUnnamed: 3_level_0\tUnnamed: 4_level_0\tUnnamed: 5_level_0\tControl vs PD OFF ???\tPD OFF vs PD ON ???\nRegion\tBA\tX\tY\tZ\tml\tGroup X Time\tMedication X Time\nFrontal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n???

In the current study we tested whether anxiety-associated expectancy of harm increases primary sensory cortex (S1) activity on non-reinforced (  i.e.  , no shock) CS+ trials. Twenty healthy volunteers completed a differential-tone trace conditioning task while undergoing fMRI, with shock delivered to the left hand. We found a positive correlation between trait anxiety and activity in right, but not left, S1 during CS+   versus   CS\u2212 conditions. Right S1 activity also correlated with individual differences in both primary auditory cortices (A1) and amygdala activity. Lastly, a seed-based functional connectivity analysis demonstrated that trial-wise S1 activity was positively correlated with regions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), suggesting that higher-order cognitive processes contribute to the anticipatory sensory reactivity. Our findings indicate that individual differences in trait anxiety relate to anticipatory reactivity for the US during associative learning. This anticipatory reactivity is also integrated along with emotion-related sensory signals into a brain network implicated in fear-conditioned responding. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nA core feature of anxiety involves disabling thoughts focused on the anticipation and expectations of harm or danger [ ]. Fear-related associative learning, or fear conditioning, is a widely used paradigm for studying anxiety-related processes. In differential fear conditioning, an otherwise benign stimulus, such as a tone (conditioned stimulus, CS+), is repeatedly paired with an aversive stimulus, such as a mild shock (unconditioned stimulus, US), while a second tone is never paired with shock (CS\u2212). In this manner, presentation of the CS+ produces a conditioned response (CR) similar to the unconditioned response (UR) produced naturally by the US (e.g., increased sweating elevates skin conductance response, or SCR). Both explicit participant reports of US expectancy and implicit differential electrodermal activity, including SCR, are robust indices of US anticipation for perceptible conditioned stimuli [ , , ]. Furthermore, individuals high in trait anxiety overestimate the likelihood that the CS+ will be paired with the US [ , ]. \n\nPrevious neuroimaging studies of fear conditioning, or associative learning more generally, have focused on the role of the amygdala in the formation of CS+/US associations [ , , ], or interactions between the amygdala and insula in threat anticipation [ ]. However, in addition to the amygdala, others have emphasized the importance of more complex, higher-order processing in accurate fear conditioning [ ]. Higher-order processes, like perception and executive attention, and related regions, such as early sensory cortices [ , , , ] and frontoparietal cortices [ , , ], are involved in more complex forms of fear conditioning, like the differential fear conditioning example provided above as compared to single-cue conditioning, in which there is no CS\u2212. In terms of the sensory cortices corresponding to the conditioned stimuli, greater activation for the CS+   versus   the CS\u2212 has been observed in the visual [ , ], the auditory [ , ] and the olfactory [ ] cortices in human neuroimaging studies. Moreover, the generalization of conditioned fear for visual conditioned stimuli appears to involve interactions between the amygdala and the extrastriate visual cortex [ , ]. The frontoparietal regions, in particular the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), also contribute to the acquisition and the formation of accurate representation of the learned association between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli [ , ]. For example, Carter   et al.   (2006) demonstrated that during both delay and trace conditioning, dlPFC activity reflects the degree of explicit contingency knowledge for the CS+ regardless of whether the trials were reinforced or non-reinforced [ ]. \n\nOne intriguing aspect of the contingency formation in fear conditioning is that it can involve the integration of information across multiple senses. Although often overlooked in the human neuroimaging literature, evidence from both non-human animal [ ] and human [ ] research has demonstrated that the sensory cortices corresponding to both the US (  i.e.  , primary somatosensory cortex, S1, in the case of shock-based conditioning) and the CS (  i.e.  , primary auditory cortex, A1, in the case of auditory tones) are active during the acquisition phase of fear conditioning. Most notably, using electroencephalography (EEG), Miltner   et al.   (1999) demonstrated that fear conditioning using visual conditioned stimuli and mild electrical shock to the finger produced significantly greater gamma band coherence between the visual and somatosensory cortex in the hemisphere contralateral to the hand being shocked [ ]. They confirmed their findings using both shock to the left hand and shock to the right hand in two independent samples of participants. Given the limitations of EEG, Miltner   et al.   were unable to also record activity from the amygdala. Using fMRI, at least two studies have similarly found that during conditioning there is greater activity in the primary sensory cortex associated with the US [ , ]. Importantly, these observations of US-related sensory activity are from trials in which no reinforcement is present to confound subsequent brain activity. Despite these earlier findings, little research to date has focused on the importance of US sensory cortex activity in fear conditioning on non-reinforced trials (  i.e.  , US-related brain activity). Furthermore, it is unknown how such a representation becomes integrated into a multisensory fear network. Given the expectancy biases observed in high anxious individuals, one possibility is that trait anxiety is positively related to individual differences in sensory cortex activity corresponding to the US. An additional possibility is that fear conditioning involves a process of multisensory integration in which the CS triggers mental representations of the US that engage sensory cortex because the sensation of the shock is recalled and also activates the amygdala due to the emotional significance of the associated US. Such integration, furthermore, should reflect individual differences and it may also rely on contributions from higher-order attention-related regions including dlPFC, as noted above [ ]. \n\nWhile the notion of multisensory integration tends to be implicit in associative learning paradigms, the role and importance of multisensory integration has not received much focus in the human neuroimaging literature [ ]. Moreover, a systematic review [ ] found that the studies that reported sensory cortex activity primarily focused on the sensory cortex activity corresponding to the CS, not the US. Fewer still consider correlations between the sensory cortices of the CS and US. \n\nThe purpose of the present study was to determine whether US-related brain activity in the sensory cortex during the anticipation of shock was associated with anxiety. Single subject shock anticipation was represented as the amount of right S1 activity during non-reinforced CS+ trials compared to CS\u2212 trials. We also confirmed implicit anticipation of the US independently with the SCR data. We combined a differential tone-based (CS) trace conditioning paradigm, in which mild shock was used as the US, with a region-of-interest (ROI) based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach. We first tested the prediction that individual differences in trait anxiety positively correlate with greater right, but not left, differential primary somatosensory cortex (S1) activity on non-reinforced (  i.e.  , no shock) CS+ compared to CS\u2212 trials. (We examined right S1 because shock was exclusively delivered to the left hand of participants.) Second, we tested the prediction that right S1 activity is integrated into a fear-related network involving the amygdala and the primary sensory cortex of the CS (  i.e.  , the primary auditory cortex, A1, given the use of tones as the CS). To do this, we examined whether individual differences in brain activity related to shock anticipation in right, but not left, S1 were correlated with activity in both A1 and the amygdala. Finally, we used a functional connectivity analysis to test the prediction that trial-by-trial activity in S1 would correlate with activity in attention-related regions, such as dlPFC, reflecting the role of attention in contingency awareness. To address these aims, the current study examined the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) response during a fear conditioning session. Basic whole-brain findings from an examination of the entire trial (tone plus trace interval) were previously reported as supplemental information for an independent study focusing on a second, post-conditioning phase of the study [ ]. \n\n\n## 2. Experimental Section \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nTwenty healthy participants (11 female) with mean age of 21.95 (range 18\u201335) participated in the study. All participants completed the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, [ ]) before the fMRI scan. The STAI is an established measure of individual differences in anxiety, which has also been widely used in the fMRI literature to measure the relationship between brain activity and individual differences in anxiety [ , , , ]. Participants\u2019 mean state anxiety (STAI-S) score was 29.50 (range 22\u201342, SD = 6.33), and their mean trait anxiety (STAI-T) score was 32.40 (range 21\u201350, SD = 7.00). Standard MRI inclusion criteria were applied for participant recruitment, such that they had to be safe for participation in the MRI environment. In addition, our   a priori   exclusion criteria included participants who self-reported having a clinically diagnosed mental illness or who reported being on, or having taken in the past, any pharmacological intervention for a mental illness. However, no participants fitting these criteria volunteered for participation in the study, nor were any participants excluded from the analysis   post hoc   due to issues of data quality, e.g., excessive motion artifacts. All participants gave informed consent in accordance with University of Southern California Institutional Review Board guidelines. \n\n\n### 2.2. Design and Procedure \n  \nStimuli and apparatus. Two tones (500 and 1500 Hz) were adopted as conditioned stimuli (CSs). The schedule of stimulus presentation and data collection were controlled by the PsychToolbox extensions [ , ] based on Matlab 2010b (MathWorks Corp., Natrick, MA, USA). The mild electric shock used as an unconditioned stimulus (US) was delivered to the third and fourth fingers of the left hand via a shock stimulator (E13\u2013E22; Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA, USA), which included a grounded RF filter. The intensity of \u201chighly unpleasant but not painful\u201d electric shock was determined individually (mean intensity = 2.30 mA, range 1.4\u20134.0 mA). Trials that included shocks were excluded in subsequent analyses. \n\nFear-conditioning task (see  ). The conditioning task consisted of one run in which either the low- or high-pitched tone was paired with electric shock. Which tone was paired with shock was counterbalanced across participants; eleven participants were conditioned with the high-pitched tone and 10 with the low-pitched tone as the CS+. Each trial in the conditioning session began with the onset of a fixation cross against a gray background. Participants were then presented with one of the CS tones for 0.7 s, followed by a 1.2 s inter-stimulus interval. After this interval, a shock was delivered for 0.5 s if the tone was assigned to the CS+ condition and followed by a fixation jittered to appear for 10, 11 or 12 s. On the CS\u2212 tone trials, there was no shock. To ensure some ambiguity between the CS\u2212US contingency ratio, participants were only required to perform a tone (CS) discrimination task. They were asked to indicate by button press with their index or middle finger of the right hand whether the tone was low or high pitched immediately after hearing the tone. In this manner, they were not explicitly engaged in trying to disambiguate the contingency ratio. Participants were, however, informed of which CS would be paired with shock prior to study commencement, consistent with a number of fear conditioning studies [ , ]. Fear contingent responding was assessed using skin conductance response (SCR). Although trace conditioning is a weaker form of associative learning, its use ensured that any activity in S1 would be due to the expectation and forecasting of threat, as even on reinforced trials (which were regressed out of the main analysis) shock did not temporally overlap with CS presentation. It also extends previous findings of multisensory integration during delay conditioning from the EEG literature [ ]. A total of 30 trials were presented in a random order: 10 CS+ with shock, 10 CS+ without shock and 10 CS\u2212 tones. Thus, CS+ tones were followed by a shock with a 50% partial reinforcement schedule. This approach was successful at eliciting a conditioned response on non-reinforced CS+ trials compared to CS\u2212 trials, as reported previously [ ]. The imaging session also involved a separate task following the conditioning phase, the details of this independent task were described previously by Lee   et al.   (2014) [ ]. \n  \nTrial structure for the fear conditioning task. A total of 30 trials were presented in a random order: 10 CS+ with shock, 10 CS+ without shock and 10 CS\u2212 tones. Thus, CS+ tones were followed by a shock with a 50% partial reinforcement schedule. \n  \n\n### 2.3. Physiological Recordings \n  \nAs described previously [ ], individual skin conductance responses (SCRs) were acquired to confirm the success of the emotional arousal manipulation with MRI-compatible electrodes placed on the index and middle finger of the left hand. All physiological data were recorded at 1 kHz sampling rates through the MP-150 system (BIOPAC System, Goleta, CA, USA), connected to a grounded RF filter, and MR-compatible leads and electrodes. The SCR data were detrended and smoothed with a median filter over 50 samples to filter out MRI-induced noise for offline analysis. SCR data epochs were extracted from a time window between 0 and 8 s after CS tone onset, and baseline-corrected between 0 and 1 s. The peak SCR amplitude from baseline was taken between 1\u20138 s on a trial-by-trial basis then averaged as a function of CS tone. Due to a technical failure, recording could not be completed for one participant. \n\n\n### 2.4. MRI Data Acquisition \n  \nAll MRI data were acquired on a Siemens 3T Magnetom Trio with a liquid crystal display projector (1024 \u00d7 768 pixels at 60 Hz) onto a rear project screen behind the head of participants and viewed using a mirror attached to a 32-channel matrix head coil at the University of Southern California Dana and David Dornsife Cognitive Neuroscience Imaging Center. High-resolution (T1-MPRAGE) structural images were acquired first (repetition time or TR = 1950 ms; echo time or TE = 2.26 ms; flip angle or FA = 7\u00b0; 1 mm isotropic voxel; 256 mm field of view). Next, functional images were acquired with gradient-echo echo-planar T2*-weighted imaging. Each functional volume consisted of 40 interleaved (no skip) 2.5 mm axial T2*-weighted slices (TR = 2000 ms; TE = 25 ms; FA = 90\u00b0; matrix size = 64 \u00d7 64; field of view = 192 mm). \n\n\n### 2.5. General fMRI Data Analysis \n  \n Preprocessing  : Standard preprocessing was conducted using FMRIBs Software Library (FSL); slice-time correction, motion correction with MCFLIRT, spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of full width at half maximum (FWHM) 6 mm, high-pass temporal filtering with a filter width of 100 s and skull stripping of structural images with FSL\u2019s rain Extraction Tool (BET), and registering each functional image to both the participant\u2019s high-resolution structural image and the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 2 mm brain. MELODIC ICA2 [ ] was applied to remove noise components. The first eight volumes were discarded to allow for signal equilibration. \n\nPrimary general linear model (GLM-1): As our main interests were how somatosensory processing during fear conditioning is modulated by trait anxiety during the perceptual processing and disambiguation of conditioned stimuli, and how such multisensory information is integrated, we estimated individuals\u2019 BOLD signal during the CS tone interval. In this way we produced two critical regressors. The first was for non-reinforced CS+ trials and the second was for CS\u2212 trials. To do so we used a gamma-variate function plus temporal derivative. Additionally, six motion parameters and shock-reinforced trials were modeled as covariates of no interest. Basic whole-brain findings from an examination of the entire trial (tone plus trace interval) were previously reported as supplemental information in Lee   et al.  \u2019s work [ ]. Although the main goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between individuals\u2019 anxiety level and the somatosensory processing, a whole-brain group-level random-effects analysis was also performed to identify general brain activation at a group level. Group level analysis was thresholded using cluster detection statistics, with a height threshold of   Z   > 2.3 cluster corrected to   p   < 0.05 (one-tailed) [ ].Whole-brain multiple comparisons correction was carried out using Gaussian Random Field Theory. \n\nSecondary general linear model (GLM-2): We ran a secondary GLM to confirm that mild shock per se to the left hand produced greater activity in right and not left somatosensory cortex. This involved modelling the shock epoch on reinforced CS+ (  i.e.  , shocked) trials (500 ms), using the- same temporal epoch for both non-reinforced CS+ and CS\u2212 trials. The results of GLM-2 were analyzed using the anatomical ROIs of right and left S1. \n\n\n### 2.6. General Region of Interest Analysis and Correlation \n  \nThe first goal of the current study was to assess the relationship between individual anxiety and responses in the right S1 (  i.e.  , region corresponding to shock delivery, see  A). Accordingly, percent signal change values were extracted individually using FSL Featquery within the right S1 region for each CS tone. As a control, the left S1 (  i.e.  , non-shock related region) was also investigated. These left and right S1 masks were obtained from a standard anatomical brain atlas provided by FSL (J\u00fclich histological atlas). Additionally, bilateral amygdala (see  B) and auditory regions (A1) were also investigated with bilateral anatomical masks obtained from the same database. Use of independent anatomical ROI masks allow for the unbiased calculation of effect size estimates by avoiding circularity [ , ]. Initial individual differences analyses between STAI-T, S1, A1, and amygdala activity were carried out using the robust correlation method [ ]. The robust method was used as it identifies bivariate outliers and removes them in the calculation of a 95% confidence interval (CI) [ ]. \n  \n(  A  ) The anatomical structural masks of S1 used in this study and scatter plots illustrating the correlation between individual trait anxiety level and evoked signal in the S1 ROI of the right and left hemispheres, respectively; (  B  ) the anatomical structural masks of amygdala (bilateral) and scatter plots illustrating the correlation between evoked signal in the amygdala and the S1 region. Gray-shaded area indicates 95% bootstrapped CIs. Red square data points indicate bivariate outliers that were identified by the robust method [ ]. \n  \n\n### 2.7. Mediation Analysis \n  \nA standard mediation analysis approach was adopted at the group level in order to delineate the relationship between our ROIs. This involved evaluating the following components using the mediation toolbox [ ]: (1) the total effect   c   (initial predictor variable \u2192 outcome, which can also be written in terms of the indirect effect   abs   + the direct effect   c\u2019  ); (2) the indirect path   a   (initial mediation analysis variable \u2192 mediator variable); (3) the indirect path   b   (mediator variable \u2192 outcome after controlling for the initial variable); (4) the direct effect   c\u2019   after controlling for the influence of the indirect path (initial predictor variable \u2192 outcome after controlling for the mediation effect); and (5) the mediation effect   abs  , which is the product of   ab  . \n\n\n### 2.8. Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nTo characterize dynamic interregional interactions between brain regions, a beta series correlation analysis [ , ] was applied. To do so, a new design matrix was created where unique trial-by-trial regressors were created for each of our conditions of interest (  i.e.  , CS+ no shock, and CS\u2212 trials). This resulted in 20 independent variables (  i.e.  , 10 CS+ tones and 10 CS\u2212 tones). The global mean signal level over all brain voxels was calculated for each time point and was included to reduce the confounding effects of the global signal change. Motion parameters and shock trials were also included in the design matrix as covariates of no interest. Finally, mean parameter estimates for each trial from the seed region (  i.e.  , S1) were extracted and used to compute correlations between the seed\u2019s signal and signal of all other voxels in the brain, thus generating condition-specific seed correlation maps. Correlation magnitudes were converted into   z   scores using the Fisher\u2019s   r  -to-  z   transformation. Condition-dependent changes in functional connectivity were assessed using random effects analyses, which were thresholded at the whole-brain level using clusters determined by   Z   > 2.3 and a cluster significance threshold of   p   = 0.05 (  corrected  ; one-tailed). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Physiological Index of Expectancy \n  \nThe success of the current fear conditioning study was confirmed by the fact that CS+ trials yielded greater SCRs than CS\u2212 trials (  t  (18) = 2.20,   p   < 0.05). This also indicates an expectation of threat. \n\n\n### 3.2. ROI Univariate Effects \n  \nGLM-1: First we examined whether there were univariate differences between the CS+ and CS\u2212 conditions in our ROIs, by comparing the parameter estimates for each condition. Whereas in the right S1 we observed marginally significant activity in the CS+ compared to the CS\u2212 (M (SEM) = 0.18(0.04), M (SEM) = 0.10(0.04),   p   = 0.055, two-tailed), in left S1 we observed significantly greater activity in the CS\u2212 compared to the CS+ condition (M (SEM) = 0.29(0.06), M (SEM) = 0.39(0.05),   p   < 0.05, two-tailed). In the bilateral A1 ROI we also observed significantly greater activity in the CS+   versus   CS\u2212 condition (M (SEM) = 0.36(0.04), M (SEM) = 0.24(0.05),   p   < 0.005, two-tailed). However, there was no significant difference between the CS+ and CS\u2212 conditions in the amygdala (  p   > 0.4). Although we observed only a marginally significant univariate effect between the CS+ and CS\u2212 in right S1, this analysis is orthogonal to the individual differences approach that is the focus of the current study. Indeed, a number of papers have found individual differences in brain activity despite an absence of univariate effects [ , , ]. \n\nGLM-2: The secondary GLM, which modeled the shock epoch of the trial, confirmed that mild shock to the left hand produced significantly greater activity in right S1 and not left S1. In right S1 there was significantly greater activity on reinforced (shocked) CS+ compared to non-reinforced CS+ trials (  t  (19) = 5.75,   p   < 0.001, two-tailed), and significantly greater activity on reinforced (shocked) CS+ compared to CS\u2212 (  t  (19) = 6.24,   p   < 0.001, two-tailed). Additionally, as expected given the lack of stimulation to the right hand, in left S1 there was no significant differences for reinforced CS+ compared to either non-reinforced CS+ trials (  t  (19) = 1.79,   p   = 0.09) and CS\u2212 trials (  t  (19) = \u22120.33,   p   = 0.74). \n\n\n### 3.3. Primary Somatosensory Cortex and Individual Differences Analyses \n  \nTo perform individual-difference (  i.e.  , correlation) analyses we subtracted the percentage signal change value for CS\u2212 from that of CS+ in all ROIs (  i.e.  , S1 for each hemisphere, bilateral A1 and bilateral amygdala), which provided an index of fear-induced reactivity for the CS+ relative to CS\u2212. As predicted, a significant positive correlation between right S1 and individual trait anxiety (STAI-T) was observed, robust Pearson   r   = 0.53,   p   < 0.05, 95% CI after bootstrapping: [0.17, 0.80], indicating that increased somatosensory activity in the region responsible for processing the shock sensations from the left hand was associated with increased anxiety ( A). Moreover, as predicted, somatosensory responses in left S1 (associated with the non-shocked right hand) did not show any relationships with STAI-T (robust Pearson   r   = 0.19,   p   > 0.05, CIs: [0.24, 0.60]  A). \n\nWe next tested the prediction that right, and not left, S1 activity would correlate with activity in both the amygdala and A1. As predicted, this analysis revealed that right S1 showed a significant positive relationship with amygdala activation, robust Pearson   r   = 0.67,   p   < 0.05, 95% CI after bootstrapping: [0.34, 0.89] ( B). Left S1 showed no significant correlation with the amygdala (robust Pearson   r   = 0.26,   p   > 0.05, CIs: [0.12, 0.57]  B). We also found that A1 showed a significant correlation with right S1 as predicted (robust Pearson   r   = 0.71,   p   < 0.05, 95% CI after bootstrapping: [0.31, 0.91]); however, A1 also correlated with left S1 (robust Pearson   r   = 0.64,   p   < 0.05, 95% CI after bootstrapping: [0.37, 0.85]), which might reflect the association between the tones and behavioral responding with the right hand. Additionally, there was a strong relationship between the amygdala and A1 regions (robust Pearson   r   = 0.63,   p   < 0.05, 95% CI after bootstrapping: [0.29, 0.84]). Lastly, although previous research using fear conditioning found that STAI-T positively correlates with fear-induced amygdala reactivity [ ], we found no such correlation (  r   = 0.0132,   p   > 0.05, CIs: [\u22120.51, 0.65]). \n\n\n### 3.4. Mediation Analysis \n  \nTo further investigate the correlation results showing that right S1 is significantly correlated with A1 and amygdala activity, we performed a mediation analysis. We set up the mediation analysis in a manner consistent with the apparent flow of information present in our experimental design. We tested the hypothesis that the effect of A1, which was the region corresponding to the initial sensory input (  i.e.  , the tones), on right S1 activity was mediated by amygdala reactivity. As shown in  , the path between A1 and amygdala (path   a  ;   a   = 0.67,   p   < 0.05) and the path between amygdala and right S1 (path   b  ;   b   = 0.35,   p   < 0.05) were statistically significant. Importantly, the mediation effect was also significant (  ab   = 0.24,   p   < 0.05) indicating that the amygdala mediated the observation of enhanced activity in right S1 during the CS+   versus   CS\u2212 condition. Additionally, even after controlling for the mediation effect, A1 had a significant influence on S1 activity. \n  \nMediation analysis at the group-level using the mean responses in each region per participant. For all variables (  i.e.  , regions) in the network, signal differences between CS+ and CS\u2212 were used as the dependent measure. Path analysis was used to test the hypothesis that the initial effect of primary auditory reactivity (A1) on the response in the primary sensory cortex (S1) was mediated by reactivity of the amygdala (AMYG). As predicted, we observed a significant mediation effect (  i.e.  ,   abs   = 0.24), and the coefficient of the   c\u2019   path (  i.e.  , the effect of A1 on S1 after controlling for the amygdala as a mediator) was diminished yet still significant. The latter suggests A1 activity had an influence of S1 activity even after controlling for the amygdala mediation. *   p   < 0.05; **   p   < 0.01. \n  \n\n### 3.5. Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nFinally, we sought to test the prediction that trial-by-trial activity in right S1 is functionally correlated with activity in regions implicated in higher-order cognitive processes. To do so, we performed a whole-brain connectivity analysis comparing the CS+ and CS\u2212 trials ( ; for full results see  ). This analysis revealed that right S1 (  i.e.  , seed region) had greater positive functional connectivity with prefrontal regions including the dlPFC (  i.e.  , middle frontal gyrus) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC;   i.e.  , paracingulate gyrus) during non-reinforced CS+ trials compared to CS\u2212 trials. Unexpectedly, we also observed that right S1 had negative functional connectivity with early visual sensory regions during non-reinforced CS+ trials compared to CS\u2212 trials, which is interesting given that the task did not involve a strong visual component. \n  \nSignificant whole-brain clusters showing connectivity with the right S1 seed region. The regions of local maxima peak is derived from sub-regions within the larger cluster based on the Harvard-Oxford atlas in FSL. \n      \nBrain regions showing both greater connectivity with S1 during CS+ than CS\u2212 (RED\u2013YELLOW) and less connectivity with S1 during CS+ than CS\u2212 (BLUE\u2013LIGHT BLUE). This reveals increased connectivity during CS+ trials between right S1 and bilateral dlPFC and dmPFC. It also reveals decreased connectivity during CS+ trials between right S1 and parts of lingual gyrus. \n  \n\n### 3.6. Whole-Brain Analysis \n  \nTo provide a broader context for our individual difference analyses we performed a whole-brain analysis of CS+   versus   CS\u2212 (see  ). As expected, this revealed greater activity for CS+ compared to CS\u2212 trials in the putative fear network, including insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus. It also revealed a similar pattern of activity in auditory cortices, and a larger cluster that included parts of the right motor and somatosensory cortices. \n  \nVoxelwise analysis for tone only model with peak MNI coordinates.

Discussion \n  \nThe purpose of the present study was to determine the significance of anticipatory activity in the primary sensory cortex corresponding to an unconditioned stimulus (  i.e.  , US-related brain activity). Specifically, we first sought to determine how such activation relates to individual differences in anxiety. Second, we aimed to determine the degree to which US-related brain activity participates in a process of multisensory integration involved in associative learning and fear conditioning. To address our aims we used a differential trace conditioning paradigm with partial reinforcement in which one auditory tone was paired with a mild shock to the left hand while a second tone was never paired with shock. Consistent with our first prediction we found that trait anxiety was positively correlated with individual differences in fear-induced right S1 activity (  i.e.  , CS+ > CS\u2212), and not left S1 activity, on non-reinforced trials, as only the left hand received the mild shock. Furthermore, consistent with our second prediction, greater right S1 activity on non-reinforced CS+   versus   CS\u2212 trials was positively correlated with regions of the fear network, particularly the amygdala and the primary auditory cortex. We followed up on this observation with a mediation analysis to elucidate how activity in right S1, A1 and the amygdala were related to each other in terms of a functional network. This revealed that activity in right S1 is positively related to A1 activity directly (  i.e.  ,   c\u2019   in   after controlling for mediation by the amygdala) and positively related to A1 activity indirectly as mediated by the amygdala (  i.e.  ,   abs   in  ). Lastly, we performed a seed-based functional connectivity analysis to examine the trial-by-trial neural correlates of right S1 activity. Consistent with our prediction that greater CS+ activity on non-reinforced trials, compared to CS\u2212 trials, in right S1 would correlate with activity in regions involved in higher-order cognitive processing, we observed greater functional connectivity between right S1 and dlPFC/dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). \n\n### 4.1. Interactions between Anxiety and Sensory Processing \n  \nAlong with early findings in the literature, our results suggest that trait anxiety is associated with greater predictive activity in the primary sensory cortex corresponding to the US. Previous observations in the human neuroimaging literature have found increased activity in US-related brain regions on non-reinforced trials [ ], particularly early on in associative learning [ ]. In the present study, greater anticipatory threat-related activity in right S1 on non-reinforced trials was positively correlated with individual differences in anxiety. The specificity of this observation was confirmed by the fact that in the left S1, which responds to the side of the body that was never shocked, there was no significant relationship between neural activity on non-reinforced CS+   versus   CS\u2212 conditions and trait anxiety. This finding is consistent with behavioral reports indicating that anxiety is positively related to the expectation of negative reinforcement [ , ]. In a recent example, Boddez   et al.   [ ] used a blocking paradigm to demonstrate that individuals high in trait anxiety had higher expectations of negative reinforcement during presentations of the blocked CS+. In another study, Robinson   et al.   [ ] demonstrated that anxiety induction enhanced the processing of threat-related information. These behavioral findings are also consistent with a recent fMRI observation that anxiety modulated the impact of aversive unconditioned stimuli on primary sensory cortex activity [ ], though this involved aversive trials per se rather than anticipatory threat trials. Nevertheless, these findings speak to the interaction between anxiety and sensory processing. An alternative interpretation is that rather than a prediction or conditioned expectancy, the S1 activity we observed is actually a prediction error. That is, S1 activity is being triggered by the absence of shock (the violation of an expectation) [ ]. Unfortunately, the current design does not allow us to disentangle these two possibilities, which future studies with a longer trace interval could [ ]. However, given the multisensory integration results discussed below, in which S1 activity is integrated into a fear conditioned neural network, we interpret our findings with reference to anticipatory, or expected, threat. If the observed S1 activity instead related to a positive appetitive prediction error (  i.e.  , no punishment when it was expected), we would anticipate no positive correlation between S1 and the fear conditioned network. \n\nOur findings also indicate that early sensory regions are not simply responding to physical stimulation. Instead, there appears to be a synergistic relationship between anxiety, and the sensory processing and anticipation of threat-related stimuli. In addition to the previously discussed findings regarding US-related brain activity, we also observed greater activity in the primary sensory cortex corresponding to the conditioned stimuli, A1, on CS+ compared to CS\u2212 trials. This observation is consistent with a number of fear conditioning studies using conditioned stimuli in the visual [ , ], the auditory [ , ], and the olfactory [ ] domains. \n\n\n### 4.2. Fear-Conditioning and the Importance of Multisensory Integration \n  \nIn addition to the relevance of anticipatory activity in the primary sensory cortex of the UC (  i.e.  , right S1), multisensory integration is one important facet of associative learning that has been often ignored in recent studies of fear conditioning in fMRI. The current study identified that individual differences in right S1 activity covary along with primary auditory cortices (A1) and the amygdala. The interaction of these three regions in an associative network was further confirmed using a mediation analysis demonstrating that the amygdala mediated a significant proportion of the relationship between A1 and right S1. \n\nAlong with previous findings, our study suggests that during the acquisition or formation of threat-related associations there is an important process of multisensory integration that varies as a function of individual differences. Although we are aware of no fMRI studies that have investigated a fear-related network in this manner, previous research involving human EEG supports our findings. Miltner   et al.   [ ] performed a delay conditioning task in which one of two colors was paired with a mild shock. Notably, they found significant gamma coherence (  i.e.  , functional connectivity) between regions of early visual cortex (  i.e.  , sensory cortex for the CSs) and the somatosensory regions corresponding to the hand that received the shock. Although Miltner   et al.   (1999) used delay conditioning with 100% reinforcement, the present study demonstrates a similar pattern of results using trace conditioning. Moreover, unlike the previous study, which used delay conditioning and analyzed reinforced trials, the current study relied on the analysis of non-reinforced trials due to the slow nature of the BOLD response. This had the added benefit of demonstrating that the processes of multisensory integration in the context of associative learning continues even during quiescent periods of the task. It is also noteworthy that studies carried out in animal models have made similar observations [ ]. Additionally, the individual differences we observed in the integration of sensory signals with the amygdala may be akin to activity observed in the fear network during instances of uncertain threat [ ], potentially representing the facilitation of contingency learning. \n\n\n### 4.3. Anxiety and Multisensory Integration \n  \nOur findings are also consistent with growing evidence demonstrating the importance of sensory cortices, and their connections with the amygdala, during the processing of threatening information in anxiety [ , , , ]. For example, Doehrman   et al.  , (2013) demonstrated that visual cortex activity in patients with social anxiety disorder is a biomarker for predicting cognitive behavioral treatment success. Specifically, those patients with greatest visual cortex activity in response to emotional   versus   neutral stimuli displayed greater symptom reductions following treatment [ ]. Similarly, in a large sample of anxious youth, Price   et al.   (2014) found impaired attentional disengagement from threat as indexed by greater activity in the fusiform gyrus of anxious compared to control participants [ ]. More recently, a diffusion tensor imaging study found that more robust structural connections between the amygdala and perceptual regions such as the inferior temporal cortex and medial aspect of the somatosensory cortex contribute to higher trait anxiety [ ]. Together, findings such as these are indicative of facilitated connections between sensory and affect-related brain areas in anxious individuals, which may serve to perpetuate threat-related attentional biases. Moreover, there is growing interest in the use of attentional retraining of anxious individuals to reverse their attentional biases towards threatening stimuli (e.g., Attention Bias Modification Treatment; ABMT) [ , ]. One possibility is that the success of such interventions relates to the strengthening of neural mechanisms involved in emotion regulation by attention control that are necessary for disrupting connections between sensory regions and the amygdala [ ]. \n\n\n### 4.4. The Role of Higher-Order Processes and Related Regions \n  \nOur findings indicate that higher-order processes are involved in anticipatory threat-related reactivity. On a trial-by-trial basis we observed greater functional connectivity between right S1 and bilateral dlPFC during presentation of the CS+   versus   the CS\u2212 tone. This observation is consistent with the involvement of higher-order cognitive factors, such as attention, and related brain regions in modulating the CS-US relationship (e.g., [ ]). Much research has detailed the contributions of attention and awareness to the strength of the contingency formation between the CS+ and the US. For example, while contingency awareness in delay conditioning, in which the CS and US temporally overlap, does not appear to be necessary for CR acquisition in all cases [ , , ], its presence is associated with heightened or more persistent conditioned responding [ , ]. In trace conditioning, where an interval typically lasting a few seconds is present in between the termination of the CS and the commencement of the US, attention and awareness appear necessary for accurate fear conditioning [ , , ]. Moreover, the dlPFC appears to be one region whose activity correlates with the CS-US contingency awareness of participants in both delay and trace conditioning [ ]. Such findings emphasize the importance of higher-order processes in associative learning, particularly as learning demands becomes more complex (  i.e.  , moving beyond single-cue conditioning). We speculate that in the context of the current study, dlPFC is involved in the generation of anticipatory activity via attention-related mechanisms in the neural regions that respond to the US (  i.e.  , the mild shock). Such mechanisms might also include more elaborative processes such as mental imagery related to the expectation of somatosensation or physical threat more generally (e.g., [ , ]). \n\nThe functional connectivity analysis also revealed greater connectivity between right S1 and right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. This may reflect the role of dmPFC in the generation of affective signals via connections with the amygdala [ , ] after the integration of predictive threat signals from sensory cortices. In addition, dmPFC is also associated with the predictive coding of aversive events [ ]. For example, Dunsmoor   et al.   [ ] found that dmPFC activity linearly increased along with the predictive strength of conditioned stimuli. Alternatively, aspects of the dmPFC are implicated in cognitive control processes such as conflict monitoring [ , , ], and the dmPFC appears to participate in such processes as part of a larger network responsible for cognitive control that also includes dlPFC (e.g., [ , , ]). Together with the observation of greater right S1 connectivity with bilateral dlPFC, the dmPFC involvement is most likely related to its role in facilitating the integration of affective signals from the amygdala and its participation in conflict monitoring in relation to predicting threat relevance. \n\n\n### 4.5. Limitations \n  \nThe current study did not explicitly ask participants the degree to which they anticipated the shock or their perception of the tone-shock contingency ratio. However, we did observe significantly greater SCR activity for the CS+   versus   the CS\u2212, which is consistent with previous research measuring anticipatory reactivity when using perceptible conditioned stimuli [ , , ]. Future research is needed to determine whether the patterns of neural activity observed in the present study would differ if participants were required to make explicit judgments of US expectancy. An additional limitation of the study is that there were twice as many CS+ trials (10 reinforced, 10 non-reinforced) as CS\u2212 trials. This was necessary to ensure that there were an equal number of trials included in the two conditions of interest (  i.e.  , the CS+ non-reinforced trials   versus   the CS\u2212 trials). Lastly, given the use of trace conditioning, it is possible that the current findings do not generalize to other forms of associative learning, like delay conditioning. However, as noted previously, previous research using EEG found a similar pattern of multisensory integration using delay conditioning [ ]. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nThe present study demonstrates that during threat-related associative learning, anticipatory US-related brain activity is modulated as a function of trait anxiety. Furthermore, individual differences in the anticipatory US-related sensory cortex response are influenced by a network of brain regions involved in the fear learning process, including the amygdala and the primary sensory regions corresponding to the conditioned stimuli. Finally, trial-by-trial activity in the US-related sensory cortex was modulated by parts of the prefrontal cortex involved in higher-order processes. Future work is needed to elucidate just how robust the influence of higher-order processes, such as attention or imagery, are on the early sensory cortices responsible for responding to aversive stimuli (e.g., [ , ]). It is also unclear how the observations made in the current study directly relate to patients suffering from anxiety-related disorders, such as phobias or post-traumatic stress disorder. Nevertheless, the present findings suggest that a focus on the interactions between anxious personality traits and the integration of multisensory information may further our understanding of how anxiety impacts information processing. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: brainsci-06-00002-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nCluster #\tCluster k\tRegion of Local Maxima\tZ\tp-Val\tH\tMNI\tMNI\tMNI\nCluster #\tCluster k\tRegion of Local Maxima\tZ\tp-Val\tH\tx\ty\tz\nCS+ > CS\u2212\tCS+ > CS\u2212\tCS+ > CS\u2212\tCS+ > CS\u2212\tCS+ > CS\u2212\tCS+ > CS\u2212\tCS+ > CS\u2212\tCS+ > CS\u2212\tCS+ > CS\u2212\n1\t1369\tSuperior/Middle Frontal Gyrus (dlPFC)\t3.41\t<0.001\tR\t34\t46\t28\n1\t1369\tParacingulate\t3.06\t<0.005\tR\t6\t52\t10\n1\t1369\tMiddle Frontal Gyrus\t3.02\t<0.005\tR\t38\t30\t42\n2\t577\tSuperior/Middle Frontal Gyrus (dlPFC)\t3.89\t<0.001\tL\t\u221224\t44\t36\nCS\u2212 > CS+\tCS\u2212 > CS+\tCS\u2212 > CS+\tCS\u2212 > CS+\tCS\u2212 > CS+\tCS\u2212 > CS+\tCS\u2212 > CS+\tCS\u2212 > CS+\tCS\u2212 > CS+\n1\t660\tOccipital pole\t3.80\t<0.001\tL\t\u22122\t\u221298\t10\n1\t660\tLingual gyrus\t3.18\t<0.001\tR\t10\t\u221276\t\u22126\n### Caption\nSignificant whole-brain clusters showing connectivity with the right S1 seed region.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the differences in brain structures and psychological characteristics between VA, VP, and NV offenders. Methods: Twenty male criminal subjects (7 VP; 6 VA; and 7 NV) offenders; and twenty age-matched male healthy non-criminals were enrolled in this study. All subjects received psychological assessments as well as magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to understand the differences among four groups with Bonferroni correction. The voxel-based morphometry and voxel-wise diffusion tensor imaging analyses were performed to compare the gray matter (GM) volume and white matter (WM) integrity between the groups. In significant regions, a Spearman correlation analysis was performed to understand the relationship between the brain changes and psychological scores. Results: The ANOVA analysis showed that AUDIT scores were significantly different among four groups, but no significant group difference was noted after Bonferroni correction. The imaging comparisons further demonstrated that the VP and NV offenders exhibited significant alterations of WM and GM tissues in the rectus and superior temporal gyrus, respectively. In addition, the VP offenders exhibited greater GM volumes than VA offenders in the right middle frontal gyrus, and NV offenders had greater GM volumes than VP offenders in the bilateral thalamus. Conclusion: We concluded that the VA, VP, and NV groups exhibited different degrees of alterations in GM and WM tissues in regions involved in emotion and cognition. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nViolent individuals have been demonstrated to exhibit abnormalities in brain structure and function [ , , , ]. There have been many studies that showed structural and functional abnormalities in the brains of antisocial individuals. Some hypotheses have proposed a link between antisocial behavior and deficits in certain brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, insula, amygdala, hippocampus, para-hippocampus, anterior cingulate gyrus, and posterior cingulate gyrus [ , , ]. Among these brain regions, the prefrontal cortex has been recognized as the most crucial brain structure that determines violent and antisocial behaviors in these aggressive individuals [ , ]. \n\nThe results of a previous meta-analysis showed significantly reduced prefrontal structure and function in antisocial individuals [ ]. These findings confirmed the replicability of prefrontal structural and functional impairments in antisocial populations and highlighted the involvement of the orbitofrontal, dorsolateral frontal, and anterior cingulate cortices in antisocial behaviors. Nevertheless, in the meta-analysis study, five studies were performed on antisocial subjects who had conducted nonviolent crimes, and seventeen were performed on antisocial subjects with comorbid psychiatric diagnoses [ ]. Therefore, it will be of value to investigate further regarding different violent behaviors and their association with brain abnormalities. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there has been only one previous brain imaging study that used positron emission tomography to investigate the brain differences between affective, impulsive, and planned violence [ ]. The results supported the hypothesis that emotional, unplanned impulsive murderers were less able to regulate and control aggressive impulses generated from subcortical structures due to deficient prefrontal regulation. However, it remains unclear whether the gray matter (GM) volume and white matter (WM) integrity are different among offenders committing crimes with impulsive/affective violence (VA), predatory violence (VP), and non-violent (NV) offenders. \n\nIn the present study, we hypothesized that VA and VP offenders may exhibit different brain structures in regions involved in emotion and cognition. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the differences of GM and WM tissues between VA, VP, NV, and healthy control (HC) groups using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and voxel-wise diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), respectively. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \nThis prospective study was approved by the local institutional review board of Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital (protocol number: VGHKS93-CT2-09). This study enrolled 20 right-handed male offenders who were further separated into 3 sub-groups by their records of court verdict: six offenders had committed affective violence (VA group), seven offenders had committed predatory violence (VP group), and seven had committed non-violent crime (NV group). The VA offenders were defined as the subjects who impulsively or affectively committed violent crime. The VP offenders were defined as the subjects who purposely planned to commit violent crime with detailed documentation in the court records. The NV offenders were defined as the subjects who committed non-violent crime based on the documents in court record. In addition, 20 age-matched right-handed male non-criminal healthy controls (HC group) were enrolled for comparisons. All subjects underwent psychological assessments as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain after providing their written informed consent. Individuals with metal implants, claustrophobia, neurological disorders, or any space-occupying lesion in the brain MRI were excluded from this study. \n\n### 2.1. Psychological Assessments \n  \nThree psychological questionnaires were arranged for each participating subject to complete. Alcohol consumption was evaluated using the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) which is a ten-item scale consisting of three dimensions: alcohol consumption, alcohol dependence, and alcohol-related problems. The highest score that can be obtained from AUDIT is 40 [ ] and scores above 8 indicate a high risk of alcohol use disorder. The questionnaire correlates highly with other alcohol screening tools and a high internal consistency (0.75 to 0.94) has been reported in various studies [ ]. Impulsiveness was assessed using self-report Dickman\u2019s impulsivity inventory (DII) [ ]. This instrument is a self-report questionnaire developed to measure two types of impulsivity, namely, functional and dysfunctional impulsivity. Dysfunctional impulsivity is the tendency to make quick decisions and act with less forethought when this tendency is non-optimal or a source of difficulty. Functional impulsivity is the tendency to make quick decisions and act with little forethought when it is optimal and beneficial. It consists of 23 items with a true/false answer and the Cronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.81 for dysfunctional impulsivity, and 0.78 for functional impulsivity. We used the dysfunctional impulsivity score in the final analysis. Hostility was measured using the Buss\u2013Durkee hostility inventory (BDHI), which was an instrument to measure the aggression potential of individuals [ ]. It is a 34-point Likert-type self-report inventory with each item scored between 1 and 5. The total aggression level is calculated with the total score and high scores indicate that the aggression tendency is high. We used the total aggression score in our final analysis. \n\n\n### 2.2. MRI Acquisition \n  \nMRI data were acquired from all participants on a 1.5T MR scanner (Signa HDx, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with an 8-channel phased-array head coil. Each subject was scanned in a supine position with head-first orientation. In this study, tri-planar scans were firstly performed for localization, then a calibration dataset was acquired for the reconstruction of parallel imaging. After conventional T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were acquired, whole-brain high-resolution T1-weighted imaging data (TR/TE/TI = 9.1/4.2/500 ms, flip angle = 20\u00b0, array coil spatial sensitivity encoding technique factor = 2, field-of-view = 250 \u00d7 188 mm, matrix size = 256 \u00d7 192, slice thickness = 1.2 mm, number of slice = 124, and number of excitation = 1), and DTI data (TR/TE = 10,000/77 ms, field-of-view = 280 \u00d7 280 mm, matrix size = 128 \u00d7 128, slice thickness = 4.4 mm, number of direction = 15, number of excitation = 3, acceleration factor = 2, scan time = 8 min) were acquired using 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo and spin-echo echo-planar diffusion-weighted pulse sequences, respectively. \n\n\n### 2.3. Image Processing \n  \nThe high-resolution T1-weighted imaging and DTI data were transferred to a standalone workstation for imaging statistics. In VBM analysis, T1-weighted images were analyzed using the CAT12 (Computational Analysis Tool version 12,  , accessed on 5 June 2022) toolbox. The preprocessing steps of the analysis were field bias modulation, tissue segmentation, diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra-based spatial normalization [ ], and spatial smoothing. In this study, default parameters and the East Asian brain template were used in the image preprocessing. Afterwards, the normalized and segmented GM images were statistically compared between the groups on a voxel-by-voxel basis. \n\nIn voxel-wise DTI analysis, the image data were firstly corrected for the motion and eddy-current distortion using rigid-body and affine registrations, respectively, run in FSL (FMRIB Software Library, Oxford, UK). Second, the brain parenchyma was extracted using a brain extraction tool based on b0 images. Third, DTI data were then analyzed to obtain fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (AD), radial (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD) using the DTIFIT (FSL, FMRIB, Oxford, UK) tool. FA is an indicator of tissue integrity. AD and RD are the diffusivity in directions parallel and perpendicular to the axons, respectively. MD is the averaged diffusivity of a tensor. Fourth, the FA maps were spatially normalized to a standard coordinate defined by an international consortium for brain mapping-FA template. The normalization was carried out using both linear affine and non-linear demon image registrations, and the corresponding AD, RD, and MD maps were spatially normalized. Finally, the voxel-wise analysis was carried out using the SPM12 toolbox (Statistical Parametric Mapping version 12,  , accessed on 5 June 2022). \n\n\n### 2.4. Statistical Analysis \n  \nFor psychological assessments, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine whether there was a significant difference between two groups. The differences were considered significant if corrected   p   < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction. For both VBM and DTI analyses, a voxel-wise two-sample   t  -test was performed to understand the difference of GM volumes and DTI indices between the groups with age as a covariate, and the differences were statistically significant if uncorrected   p   < 0.001 and cluster > 100 voxels. Moreover, in significant regions, a Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis was performed to understand the relationship between the structural changes and the scores in each group. The correlation was considered significant if   p   < 0.05. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \nOne-way ANOVA analysis revealed that, in psychological assessments, only the AUDIT scores were significantly different among the groups, but no significant AUDIT differences were noted between two groups after Bonferroni correction, as shown in  . Besides, the HC group had significantly higher education levels than other subgroups. \n\nIn VBM analysis, the results showed that the offenders (VA, VP, and NV) had significantly greater GM volumes than the HC group in the right superior temporal gyrus. The sub-group comparisons further revealed that only the NV group had significantly greater GM volumes than the HC group in the right superior temporal gyrus, but the VA and VP groups did not exhibit significant change in GM volume as compared to the HC group, as shown in  . In addition, the NV group had significantly greater GM volumes than the VP group in bilateral thalamus, whereas the VP group had significantly greater GM volumes than the VA group in the right middle frontal gyrus. However, no significant differences in GM volume were noted between VA and NV groups, as shown in  . The Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates of regions with significantly different GM volumes between VA, VP, NV, and HC groups are listed in  . No significant correlation was noted between GM volume and psychological scores in significant regions. \n\nIn DTI analysis, the results showed that the offenders (VA + NV + NV) had significantly increased AD, RD, and MD values than those of HC group. The sub-group comparisons further revealed that only the VP group exhibited significantly increased AD, RD, and MD values than the HC group in the right rectus gyrus, as shown in  . The MNI coordinates of regions with significantly different AD, RD, and MD values between VP and HC groups are listed in  . However, no significant correlation was noted between DTI indices and psychological scores in the significant region. \n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate changes in brain GM, WM, and psychological characteristics in affective, predatory, and non-violent offenders. Different from previous studies [ , , , , , ], the present study demonstrated that, although non-violent offenders had slightly higher AUDIT scores than other groups, the psychological characteristics (AUDIT, DII, and BDHI scores) were not significantly different between two sub-groups after Bonferroni correction. In brain structures, the non-violent offenders had significantly increased GM volumes in the right superior temporal gyrus, and the predatory offenders had significantly increased diffusivity in the right rectus gyrus as compared to healthy subjects. Moreover, the non-violent offenders exhibited greater GM volumes than the predatory offenders in the bilateral thalamus, and the predatory offenders had greater GM volumes than affective offenders in the right middle frontal gyrus. These findings highlighted the different involvement of cerebral GM and WM tissues between the three groups. \n\nIn the predatory offenders, the DTI results demonstrated that the predatory offenders had significantly higher AD, RD, and MD values than healthy subjects in the right rectus gyrus. The rectus gyrus was previously shown to be associated with depression [ ], aggression (irritability and hostility) [ ], and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders [ ]. It is known that the increased diffusivity may indicate that the extra-cellular space was increased likely due to partial axonal loss or vasogenic edema. Therefore, the predatory offenders may have altered right rectus gyrus function due to axonal degeneration, thus indicating possible impact on depression, aggression, attention, and hyperactivity behaviors. Further investigation will be needed to show the relationship between these behavioral characteristics and brain structural changes in violent subjects. In the non-violent offenders, although the VBM analysis demonstrated that all of the offenders (VA, VP, and NV) exhibited increased GM volume in the right superior temporal gyrus than healthy subjects, the sub-group comparison revealed that only non-violent offenders had significantly greater GM volumes than healthy subjects in the gyrus. The superior temporal gyrus was shown to be involved in the perception of emotions in facial stimuli, language, auditory processing, and social cognition processes [ , ]. Therefore, the finding of increased GM volume in the right superior temporal gyrus suggests that the non-violent offenders may exhibit altered functions involved in facial stimuli, language, auditory processing, and social cognition.  \n\nIn addition, the affective offenders exhibited a significantly smaller GM volume than the predatory offenders in the right middle frontal gyrus, suggesting that the affective offenders exhibited functions of emotion, attention, and memory different from those in the predatory offenders. The non-violent offenders had greater GM volumes than predatory offenders in the bilateral thalamus. It is known that the thalamus plays an important role in sensory, motor, attention, cognition, and memory functions. The findings may indicate that the predatory offenders exhibited more deteriorations in sensory, motor, cognition, and memory functions than those of the non-violent offenders.  \n\nMoreover, some previous studies demonstrated increased GM volumes in both cortical and subcortical regions [ , ], but others showed reduced GM volumes [ , , , , ]. One previous study further reported no significant changes in violent offenders as compared to healthy subjects [ ]. Differently, the present study demonstrated that the non-violent offenders exhibited increased GM volumes, and the affective and predatory offenders did not have significant alterations of GM volume as compared to healthy subjects. The inconsistent GM volume changes between the previous and present studies were likely attributable to the characteristics of enrolled violent subjects, as well as grouping strategy. Specifically, the smaller GM volume of the right middle frontal gyrus in the affective offenders than the predatory offenders further supports the hypothesis that emotional, unplanned impulsive murderers were less able to regulate and control aggressive impulses due to deficient prefrontal regulation, whereas predatory offenders have more prefrontal capacity to regulate and control these impulses [ , ]. Our preliminary findings may shed a light on the understanding of brain structural differences between the affective and predatory offenders.  \n\nThere are some limitations to the present study that warrant discussion. First, a small sample size may lead to a low statistical power. A study enrolling more violent subjects will be needed to provide more comprehensive results. Second, this study only enrolled male subjects. Therefore, these results do not reflect brain changes in female subjects. Third, the present study did not evaluate cognitive functions of the enrolled subjects, so the difference of cognitive functions between the violent subjects could not be confirmed. Fourth, the education levels of healthy subjects were higher than the offenders, so the results may have been affected by the education difference between the offenders and healthy subjects. Finally, in DTI analysis, the through-plane resolution (slice thickness) was relatively lower than the in-plane resolution; hence, the results of DTI analysis may be affected by the partial volume averaging in the through-plane direction. In addition, the DTI was acquired with echo-planar imaging pulse sequence, and likely suffered from susceptibility distortions. Thus, the results of the present study might be influenced by the susceptibility distortions. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nThis study performed both VBM and DTI analyses to understand the changes in GM volume and WM diffusion, and psychological characteristics in violent offenders. Our results demonstrated that the predatory and non-violent offenders exhibited significant changes in WM diffusion and GM volume in the rectus and superior temporal gyrus, respectively. Moreover, the predatory offenders had greater GM volumes than affective offenders in the right middle frontal gyrus, and that the non-violent offenders exhibited greater GM volumes than predatory offenders in the bilateral thalamus. Therefore, we concluded that the affective, predatory, and non-violent offenders exhibited different patterns of alterations in GM and WM tissues in regions involved in emotion and cognition. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: tomography-08-00121-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nGroup\tAge (Years)\tEducation (Years) *\tAUDIT *\tDII\tBDHI\nVA\t34.7 \u00b1 12.1\t9.4 \u00b1 1.1 #\t4.4 \u00b1 5.6\t9.4 \u00b1 3.8\t14.6 \u00b1 11.1\nVP\t36.4 \u00b1 8.9\t9.4 \u00b1 2.1 \u03b7\t3.3 \u00b1 1.7\t9.3 \u00b1 3.4\t16.4 \u00b1 8.3\nNV\t38.1 \u00b1 8.0\t9.4 \u00b1 2.5 \u03b8\t10.9 \u00b1 11.3\t10.1 \u00b1 4.3\t18.9 \u00b1 7.8\nHC\t34.8 \u00b1 9.6\t13.4 \u00b1 2.9 #,\u03b7,\u03b8\t2.4 \u00b1 2.2\t9.5 \u00b1 3.1\t19.3 \u00b1 8.7\n### Caption\nThe demographic characteristics of enrolled subjects.\n### Footer\nAUDIT: Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test.

Gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration levels in sensory areas have been shown to correlate with hemodynamic and oscillatory neuronal responses. How these measures relate to one another during working memory, a higher-order cognitive process, is still poorly understood. We address this gap by collecting magnetoencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and Flumazenil positron emission tomography data within the same subject cohort using an n-back working-memory paradigm. By probing the relationship between GABA  receptor distribution, neural oscillations, and Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) modulations, we found that GABA  receptor density in higher-order cortical areas predicted the reaction times on the working-memory task and correlated positively with the peak frequency of gamma power modulations and negatively with BOLD amplitude. These findings support and extend theories linking gamma oscillations and hemodynamic responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission and to the excitation-inhibition balance and cognitive performance in humans. Considering the small sample size of the study, future studies should test whether these findings also hold for other, larger cohorts as well as to examine in detail how the GABAergic system and neural fluctuations jointly support working-memory task performance. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nA finely orchestrated balance between excitation and inhibition is central to healthy brain function. Distinct brain imaging techniques provide complementary insights into brain function by tapping into distinct physiological signatures of brain activity at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Despite important advances, our grasp on the neural bases of cognition remains arguably fragmented because the relationship between the findings obtained across different imaging modalities is not fully elucidated. In particular, how synaptic neurotransmission relates to electrophysiological and to hemodynamic responses is still largely unsettled. A handful of studies have sought to overcome this limitation by combining insights from multiple modalities, including methods that probe hemodynamic and electrophysiological (e.g. oscillatory) brain responses as well as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration ( ). However, previous work that has jointly probed these measures has focused essentially on primary sensory or motor areas ( ;  ;  ) and it is unclear how these features relate to one another in the case of higher-order cognitive systems, such as working memory (WM). Harnessing such an understanding would be crucial to bridge findings and combine insights from various studies of the neural underpinnings of human cognition. The construction and neural underpinnings of WM have been studied extensively via, e.g. behavioral models ( ;  ), hemodynamic ( ) and electrophysiological neuroimaging ( ;  ;  ), stimulation based approaches ( ) as well as neurotransmitter investigations ( ;  ), also by combining two or more of these alternatives ( ;  ;  ). These studies have revealed distinct executive and storage components within WM as well as highlighted the role of a range of neural processes and cortical structures involved in efficient WM performance. However, because previous work on WM did not simultaneously examine hemodynamics, electrophysiology, and synaptic neurotransmission, the links between the insights afforded by these different signatures of WM have yet to be established. \n\nThe last 15\u00a0years have witnessed a rising interest in determining the links between GABAergic inhibition and both electrophysiological and hemodynamic signaling ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, only a few studies have sought to evaluate the relationship between GABAergic inhibition and other neural signals in higher order cortical regions ( ). Despite the consensus that such multimodal studies are necessary, they are complex, costly and can be methodologically challenging given the diversity of expertise required. Incidentally, the wealth of research conducted on WM would particularly benefit from such systems-level insights in order to bridge observations from different imaging modalities ( ). \n\nInvestigations applying electrophysiological approaches to WM have revealed that it builds on a wide range of oscillatory mechanisms ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) associated with different roles ranging from maintenance to inhibition and to the organization of items ( ), with the interactions between oscillations facilitating the functioning of the WM system as a whole ( ;  ). In particular, electrophysiological studies have shown that oscillatory activity and bursting in the gamma band play a vital role in WM ( ;  ) and that this activity is linked both to the subjects\u2019 memory capacity and to task accuracy ( ;  ). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, in turn, have revealed intricate patterns of brain areas in these regions supporting encoding, maintenance and retrieval of distinct features, object manipulation and inhibition of distracting stimuli ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Akin to electrophysiological investigations, fMRI-based studies have demonstrated that interactions between various neurocognitive components are central in WM performance, especially in demanding tasks ( ;  ). In recent years, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies have also shown that increased GABA levels and GABA-to-glutamate ratios are beneficial to WM capacity and accuracy ( ;  ;  ). These results along with evidence from receptor antagonist studies underline the importance of both glutamate and GABA in neuronal firing during WM tasks ( ;  ). Pharmacological manipulations have also been used to show that GABAergic interneurons play a key role in the generation of both alpha- and gamma-band oscillations which, in turn, link to WM performance ( ). Moreover, MRS-based studies have demonstrated that both the frequency and amplitude of neural oscillations correlate with GABA concentration as well as WM performance ( ). \n\nHowever, because previous studies on WM have not simultaneously probed electrophysiological, hemodynamic, GABAergic and behavioral measures, bridging findings from the different streams of research on WM has remained a challenge, limiting progress toward a holistic understanding of the neural basis of WM. It is possible that the relationships between GABAergic, electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals that have been observed in sensory and motor areas comprise a general principle that holds also in higher-order cortical networks. However, there has been no evidence to date to support this. \n\nHere, we address this gap by combining, for the first time, magnetoencephalography (MEG), fMRI, Flumazenil positron emission tomography (FMZ-PET) data and behavioral measures, recorded in the same subject cohort during a classical WM task. These rare, yet small-scale data with thirteen subjects, allow initial exploration of the joint role of the GABAergic system and neural and hemodynamic fluctuations in WM. More specifically, through this unique combination of modalities, and inspired by previous reports on the roles of gamma activity in both WM and neuronal inhibition, we probe the link between gamma oscillations, Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) and GABA  receptor distribution in WM networks and we examine how these features relate to behavior. We expect that the GABA  receptor density in higher order cortical regions involved in WM would show positive correlations with gamma-band oscillatory frequency and negative correlations with BOLD amplitude. Moreover, we expect that across the neural measures particularly the GABA  receptor density is linked with WM task performance. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Subjects and experimental design \n  \nThirteen healthy, native French-speaking subjects participated in the study. fMRI data were collected successfully from all 13 subjects. For one subject, the MEG recording failed due to technical reasons and one subject did not participate in the PET recording. Moreover, the MEG data of one subject had to be discarded due to excessive blinking. Data of sufficient quality were recorded with all three modalities (PET, MEG, fMRI) from 10 subjects (1 female, 9 males; age 19\u201329\u00a0years, mean 24\u00a0years). All research was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects, in agreement with the prior approval of the Institutional Review Board and by the National French Science Ethical Committee (CPPRB). All methods were conducted in accordance with the CPPRB guidelines. The fMRI and MEG experiments consisted of a classical WM task of visually presented letters, with 3\u00a0s intervals between consecutive letters. Each letter was shown for 300\u00a0ms. The paradigm comprised three different memory load conditions (1-back, 2-back, and 3-back tasks), and the subjects indicated with a button press, after each letter, whether the letter matched or did not match the appropriate preceding letter. In the fMRI experiment, we also collected resting-state data. \n\n\n### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nThe performance of the subjects in the WM tasks was estimated based on the MEG data that also contained the type (match/non-match) and timing of the subjects\u2019 responses. Here, we computed the number of correct and incorrect responses as well as separate reaction times for them within each individual and WM task. Trials for which the reaction times fell outside 2 standard deviations of the average within the task were excluded from the analyses. Based on the number of true/false positive/negative responses, we also derived the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity measures for each subject and task. The behavioral data collected during the MEG recordings were used as the fMRI data were collected immediately after the MEG recordings, leading to potential learning effects influencing the task performance during fMRI data collection. \n\n\n### MEG, fMRI, and PET data collection \n  \nAll data (MEG, PET, and MRI) were collected from the same participants at the CERMEP imaging center (Lyon, France). The MEG data were recorded in a magnetically shielded room using a 275-channel CTF whole-head system. The signals were band-pass filtered at 0.016\u2013150\u00a0Hz and sampled at 600\u00a0Hz. The anatomical and functional magnetic resonance images were collected with a 1.5 Tesla scanner (Siemens Sonata Maestro Class)   .    The T1-weighted anatomical MRIs were obtained with 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u00a0mm  resolution. The functional MRIs were acquired in three runs using a pulse sequence with repetition time/echo time (TR/TE) 2500/60\u00a0msec, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, field of view (FOV; in-plane)\u2009=\u2009220\u00a0mm, in-plane resolution 3.4\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4 and slice thickness 4\u00a0mm, spacing between slices 4.4\u00a0mm. The PET data were recorded with a Siemens HR+ camera, and [11C]flumazenil (FMZ), an agent that binds to benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor, was used. FMZ (RO15-1788) was labeled with 11C, using the methylation process ( ). A dynamic 3D acquisition was applied providing 12 consecutive frames of 63 contiguous 2.42\u00a0mm thick slices, with an isotropic spatial resolution near 5\u00a0mm3 FWHM (full width at half-maximum). A 68Ge transmission scan was used to measure the attenuation correction. A partial saturation protocol consisting of a single intravenous injection of a mixture of 5\u00a0mCi of [11C]FMZ and 0.01\u00a0mg/kg of unlabeled FMZ was used, followed by acquisition of the emission data for 55\u00a0min. This single injection allowed the calculation of B\u2019max parametric images, i.e. estimates of receptor density, without arterial blood sampling ( ). \n\n\n### MEG data analysis \n  \nNeural activity estimates were obtained from the MEG signals with event-related Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources (erDICS), a beamforming technique in the time-frequency domain ( ;  ). In erDICS, the cortical-level beamforming estimates are based on the sensor-level time-dependent cross-spectral density matrix (CSD), computed using Morlet wavelets. Here, wavelets with the width 7\u00a0cycles for every frequency were used to calculate the CSDs between 36 and 104 at 2\u00a0Hz resolution in the range from 500\u00a0ms before stimulus onset to 1500\u00a0ms post stimulus at 17\u00a0ms intervals. The width parameter defines both the spectral bandwidth and duration of the wavelets, with lower frequencies analyzed with longer wavelets that lead to lower temporal resolution, but higher frequency resolution compared with higher frequencies when a constant number of cycles is used across all frequencies ( ). Trials in which the amplitude of either the vertical or the horizontal electro-oculogram exceeded 150\u00a0\u03bcV were rejected. In addition, the MEG data were examined visually and data segments that contained artifacts were excluded from the analysis. The beamforming estimates of cortical oscillatory power levels at different frequencies were computed, using a spherical head model, in a spatially equivalent grid across subjects. The grid, consisting of 3922 points, was constructed by creating a regular grid at 6-mm intervals in an atlas brain and by transforming this grid to the individual brains using Fieldtrip and SPM8 ( ). For the visualization of the data, the volumetric beamforming maps were project to the surface of the brain with Freesurfer ( ). \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nThe fMRIs data analysis was conducted with SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, United Kingdom). The first four volumes were discarded to allow for magnetic saturation effect. The functional images were slice-time corrected, realigned to the first image of the first run and then co-registered with the anatomical MRI. The realigned and co-registered images were then normalized to the standard SPM8 echo-planar image template and smoothed with an 8-mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel. The data were high-pass filtered with a cut-off frequency of 1/510\u00a0Hz and serial correlations were compensated for by using a first order autoregressive model. The preprocessed data were included in a general linear model (GLM) that included the three WM condition (1-, 2-, and 3-back) and rest as well as movement parameters as nuisance regressors. The individual-level fMRI data were spatially normalized to the MNI template in SPM8 for group-level estimation of the WM-load dependent modulations. \n\n\n### PET data analysis \n  \nStatic PET images were obtained by summing frames 8\u201312 from the dynamic imaging (corresponding to the acquisition period from 20 to 55\u00a0min post-injection). These static images of the PET volumes were realigned to the anatomical MRIs. Ten-millimeter circular ROIs were placed over the midportion of the pons, a suitable reference region for the calculation of the nonspecific FMZ binding60; the reference encompassed 7\u20139 consecutive MRI slices displaying that structure. These ROIs were then transferred onto the corresponding FMZ-PET slices. An additional circular ROI with 15\u00a0mm diameter was placed over the occipital cortex which commonly displays a high concentration of BZD receptors ( ). A partial-saturation model, based on a Scatchard plot, was then used to obtain the B\u2019max parametric images ( ). In this model, the free ligand concentration is estimated in the pons, whereas the range of the bound ligand concentration is evaluated in the occipital cortex. Using this approach we obtained, for each subject, a set of 63 contiguous 2.42\u00a0mm thick parametric images of BZD receptor B\u2019max. Each individual\u2019s PET data were smoothed using a 15\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009\u00d7\u200921\u00a0mm FWHM Gaussian kernel; the level of smoothing was chosen to achieve similar resolution to the MEG estimates of neural activity ( ). The PET-data were co-registered with each individual\u2019s anatomical MRI in SPM8. \n\n\n### ROI identification \n  \nROIs were identified separately based on the MEG and fMRI data. For MEG, estimates of oscillatory power were computed in three distinct time windows (0\u2013500, 500\u20131000, and 1000\u20131500\u00a0ms post stimulus) in each of the three WM tasks. These individual-level power maps were normalized by dividing them by the standard deviation of mean baseline activity (\u2212500 to 0\u00a0ms) across the three WM tasks across all grid points. The ROIs within each time window were obtained by contrasting the average oscillatory activity of the 3- and 2-back tasks with the activity of the 1-back task and by identifying clusters that showed significant activity at the group level (Wilcoxon signed rank test,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, cluster-size >\u200950,   n  \u2009=\u200910). Here, it would have also been possible to use ROIs known to be involved in WM or to use repeated measures tests to evaluate systematic magnitudes/rankings across the three WM-conditions. However, as we wanted to identify regions showing WM-related modulations specifically for the present cohort as well as to utilize the same data for the ROI identification and correlations analyses (see section \u201cCorrelation analyses in the ROIs\u201d below), the present bi-variate approach was used. The fMRI ROIs were identified in a similar manner. First the beta-parameters for all WM tasks in each individual were normalized by dividing them with the standard deviation of the beta-parameters during rest in the whole brain. The average of the beta-parameters of 3- and 2-back tasks were then contrasted to the beta-values during the 1-back task and clusters that showed significant activity at the group level were identified (Wilcoxon signed rank test,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, cluster-size >\u2009300,   n  \u2009=\u200910). \n\n\n### Correlation analyses in the ROIs \n  \nWithin the identified ROIs, we estimated correlations between both the neural (MEG, fMRI, PET) and behavioral measures. For the MEG data, we determined in each ROI the individual-level peak amplitude and frequency within the range between 40 and 100\u00a0Hz. Here, the data were averaged across all grid points within the ROI. In this analysis, we averaged the data across an 8\u00a0Hz window at each bin to reduce the effects of noise (e.g. estimate of activity of 40\u00a0Hz was calculated based on the average CSD at the interval of 36\u201344\u00a0Hz). The peak frequencies were computed by identifying the frequency for which the ratio of activity between the average of 3- and 2-back tasks and the 1-back task was maximal. The amplitude modulation for each subject was obtained by subtracting the activity during the 1-back task from the average activity during the 3- and 2-back tasks at this frequency. In this analysis, each subject\u2019s data were normalized by the standard deviation in all grid points across all frequency bins in the baseline time-window (\u2212500\u20130\u00a0ms with respect to stimulus presentation across the three n-back tasks). The standard deviation-based normalization was chosen as in n-back tasks the baseline time-window comprises also WM-specific neural activity and by subtracting this activity from the post-stimulus data does not necessarily lead to the accurate quantification of amplitude modulations. The chosen approach, computed across all source locations and frequencies only some of which represent tasks-relevant signals should, in turn, yields a good estimate of random fluctuations within the data whose magnitude depends on the subject-specific overall strength of the MEG recordings. Accordingly, the approach yields normalized estimates that allow comparing the values across subjects ( ). Parametric modeling of the spectra within individual conditions with FOOOF ( ) did not systematically detect gamma-band oscillatory peaks in all subjects in every identified cluster. In the fMRI data, we first averaged the beta-values across the voxels within the ROI. These beta-parameters were normalized by dividing them with the standard deviation of the beta-parameters during rest in the whole brain. The individual-level modulation of BOLD activity within each ROI was then determined by subtracting the activity during the 1-back task from the average activity during the 3- and 2-back tasks. For the PET data, we determined for each MR-voxel within the MEG and fMRI ROIs the closest corresponding PET voxel and defined the unique set of these PET voxels for each ROI. As the measure of GABA  receptor density in each ROI, we used the average of GABA  receptor density in these PET voxels. The correlations between the different neural measures and between neural and behavioral measures were computed using Spearman\u2019s rho (  n  \u2009=\u200910). As with low number of subjects the correlation estimates may be influenced by outliers in the data, we computed the 95% confidence limits for the correlation estimates using bootstrapping for both the correlations across the neural data as well as between neural and MEG-based behavioral data (  n  \u2009=\u200910 in all bootstrapping analyses). In the approach we left out data pairs for 2 random subjects 200 times and computed the correlation values for the re-sampled data. From the obtained distribution of 200 correlation values, we calculated the 95% upper and lower confidence limits. This procedure was applied to all correlation analyses showing significant findings with the full sample of subjects. To evaluate the predictive value of the observed correlation patterns, we also used a leave-two-out-based classification analysis to test whether the linear relationship between data types (e.g. GABA  receptor density and gamma peak frequency) observed within a sub-sample of eight subjects would correctly predict the relationship for the left-out subjects. Here, a polynomial of degree one was used as the linear model. The eight subjects for the training data were randomly drawn 500 times and for each round we labeled for the predicted data type (e.g. predicted gamma frequency based on the subject\u2019s GABA  receptor density) the subject whose true value was closer to the predicted one. This procedure yielded 1000 incorrect/correct classifications, allowing to determine the overall classification accuracy. The 99% confidence limit for the classification was obtained by randomly conducting the same procedure 200 times with random pairings of the two data types for the eight subjects whose data were used in the training. We also examined using multiple linear stepwise backward regression in SPSS 28.0 (IBM) the possible joint effect of the imaging measures on the behavioral data. The analyses were conducted separately for MEG- and fMRI-specific ROIs, i.e. MEG-measures were examined jointly with GABA  receptor density only in the ROIs identified based on MEG modulations. In the analysis, we applied the default parameters (e.g.   P  \u2009\u2265\u20090.1 removal criterion) within the stepwise backward regression. Unless mentioned otherwise, for all correlations and regression analyses reported here we used uncorrected   P  -values. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nTo investigate the interplay between high-frequency neural oscillations, hemodynamics and GABAergic inhibition, we measured gamma-band oscillations with MEG, BOLD activity with fMRI, and GABA  receptor density using FMZ-PET all in the same population of healthy individuals. The characteristics of oscillatory neuromagnetic signals and BOLD dynamics in each individual were assessed during the performance of a standard n-back visual WM task. The FMZ-PET data used to determine the GABA  receptor density were collected while the subjects were resting in the scanner. Individual subject WM performance was probed using multiple behavioral metrics (reaction times, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) based on the subjects\u2019 responses during the MEG experiment. We leveraged this combination of data to probe the relations between behavior and the different neural measures specifically in brain regions showing load-dependent modulation of activity during WM (see  ). \n  \nThe study consisted of the collection of multimodal neuroimaging data during an n-back task and the determination of the relationship between the neuroimaging signals and their link to WM task performance. (A) MEG and fMRI data were collected during the experimental task which consisted of 1-, 2-, and 3-back tasks of visually presented letters, while FMZ-PET data were collected during rest. (B) From the experimental data, we determined (C) the WM task performance measures (reaction times, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) as well as measures of oscillatory (peak frequency and amplitude) and hemodynamic (BOLD signal amplitude) activity, whereas the FMZ-PET data collected during rest were used to determine GABA -receptor densities across the brain. \n  \n### ROI identification based on the modulation of gamma-band and BOLD activity \n  \nFor both the MEG and fMRI data, the average activity during the high memory-load conditions (3- and 2-back) was contrasted to the activity during the 1-back task (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05, see  ), where the MEG investigation was done in three distinct time windows following each stimulus (0\u2013500, 500\u20131000, and 1000\u20131500\u00a0ms). ROIs (2 in MEG, 5 in fMRI; see  ,   and  ) were identified from these voxel-level maps by determining contiguous clusters per modality and time window. The ROI labels in   do not represent any specific parcellation schemes but, instead, give approximate information on the main cortical regions the observed effects extend to. Note also that the extents of the ROIs do not necessarily accurately represent the true extents of the relevant modulations as the observed effects depend on the selected source-modeling approach and the chosen statistical threshold. \n  \nBrain areas showing significant modulation of activity as a function of memory load for MEG and fMRI (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05). Areas showing more neural/hemodynamic activity during conditions with a higher memory load are shown in red/yellow and areas showing less activity in blue. For visualization purposes, the volumetric data are projected to the surface of the brain. \n    \nROIs identified based on MEG and fMRI data (MEG1: 500\u20131000\u00a0ms; MEG2: 1000\u20131500\u00a0ms). \n  \n\n### The relationship between GABA  receptor density, gamma-band power, and BOLD activity \n  \nIn the clusters identified based on gamma-band power modulations, peak modulation frequency was identified by comparing the average activity between the 3- and 2-back conditions to the 1-back condition (see   and  ). This approach to identifying peak gamma frequency (and gamma amplitude at this frequency) was used to examine the relationship between individual gamma-band profiles and GABAergic inhibition across participants. This approach is fine-tuned to detecting peaks in gamma oscillations that are specific to WM as they are derived from identifying load-related increases in broad-band high-frequency activity ( ). \n  \nGroup- (first three panels) and individual-level (last two panels) gamma-band spectra in the two MEG clusters of interest for the different WM comparisons. In the group-level spectra, confidence intervals represent the grand average\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM values. The vertical dashed line in the individual-level spectra represents the identified peak modulation frequencies, shown next to the peaks. GABA -receptor densities in the graphs represent the average values within the MEG clusters for each of the example subjects. \n  \nIn both MEG ROIs (Cuneus and Medial/Middle Frontal Gyrus), we found a significant positive correlation (Spearman\u2019s rho,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05) between the GABA  receptor density and the peak frequency of the gamma-band activity. The 95% confidence intervals of the rho values were between 0.43 and 0.88 for the two ROIs (Cuneus, CI , 0.46\u20130.88; Medial/Middle Frontal Gyrus, CI , 0.43\u20130.83). In both, ROIs, the classification analysis suggested that the relationship determined based on a sub-sample of the subjects was predictive of the relationship in the other subjects (Cuneus: accuracy\u2009=\u200966.4%, CL \u2009=\u200956.95%; Medial/Middle Frontal Gyrus: accuracy\u2009=\u200958%, CL \u2009=\u200949.95%). In contrast, the correlation between receptor density and gamma amplitude did not reach significance ( ). As far as the fMRI ROIs are concerned, we found a significant negative correlation between BOLD amplitude and GABA  receptor density in the Precuneus (CI , \u22120.38 to 0.95). The classification analysis showed a significant predictive value for this relationship (accuracy\u2009=\u200963.5%, CL \u2009=\u200955.6%). The correlations in the other four ROIs were not significant ( ). No significant correlations were detected between BOLD amplitude and gamma peak-frequency or amplitude (see  ). \n  \nCorrelation (Spearman\u2019s rho) between GABA -receptor density and gamma-band peak amplitude and frequency in brain areas showing significant modulation of activity as a function of memory load.

See   for the sizes, Brodmann areas, and Talairach coordinates of the ROIs. \n    \nCorrelation (Spearman\u2019s rho) between GABA -receptor density and BOLD amplitude in brain areas showing significant modulation of activity as a function of memory load. The   x  -axis portrays the mean receptor density (A.U.). The correlations were examined in five ROIs (fMRI1: precentral/middle frontal gyrus; fMRI2: precuneus; fMRI3: inferior parieral lobule; fMRI4: superior frontal gyrus; fMRI5: temporo-parietal junction). See   for the sizes, Brodmann areas, and Talairach coordinates of the ROIs. \n  \n\n### Behavioral performance during the WM task \n  \nThe performance of the subjects during the WM task was determined by quantifying the reaction times for each of the tasks (1-, 2-, and 3-back) and the number of incorrect and correct responses, and by deriving the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity scores based on the number of responses. These measures (see  ) show the expected decrease in performance as a function of memory load and a marked increase in reaction times in the 2- and 3-back conditions compared with the 1-back task (reaction times for correct responses in 3- and 2-back vs. 1-back condition, Wilcoxon signed rank test,   P  \u2009<\u20090.01). The other behavioral measures showed similar effects, with significant differences between 3- and 1-back conditions for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (  P  \u2009<\u20090.01) and between 2- and 1-back conditions for sensitivity and accuracy (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05; specificity,   P  \u2009=\u20090.31). \n  \nBehavioral performance in the WM tasks. \n  \n\n### The relationship between GABA  receptor density and WM reaction times \n  \nWhen we computed correlations between the neural measures (gamma-band and BOLD activity, GABA  receptor density) and the different behavioral measures (reaction times, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity), we found significant correlations (Spearman\u2019s rho) only between the GABA  receptor density and reaction times measures (see  ). In the 2 MEG and 5 fMRI ROIs, the GABA  receptor density showed significant negative correlation with reaction times in the 3-back task in the Inferior Parietal Lobule (CI , \u22120.60 to \u22120.88) and Temporo-Parietal Junction (CI , \u22120.62 to \u22120.93; see  ). In both regions, the classification analysis suggested that the relationship determined in a set of subjects would correctly predict the relationship between GABA  receptor density and reaction times in other subjects (Inferior Parietal Lobule: accuracy\u2009=\u200965.7%, CL \u2009=\u200950.45%; Temporo-Parietal Junction: accuracy\u2009=\u200965.5%, CL \u2009=\u200951.7%). Across the ROIs, the GABA  receptor density showed significant negative correlation with the reaction times difference between the 3- and 1-back tasks in the Medial/Middle Frontal Gyrus (CI , \u22120.50 to \u22120.79), Inferior Parietal Lobule (CI , \u22120.60 to \u22120.79) and Temporo-Parietal Junction (CI , \u22120.50 to \u22120.81). In all these regions, the classification analysis yielded significant results in predicting the reaction times difference from the GABA  receptor density (Medial/Middle Frontal Gyrus: accuracy\u2009=\u200967.6%, CL \u2009=\u200953.8%; Inferior Parietal Lobule: accuracy\u2009=\u200969.8%, CL \u2009=\u200954.55%; Temporo-Parietal Junction\u2009=\u200968.3%, CL \u2009=\u200954.05%). We also tested whether the reaction times were associated with the GABA  receptor density in cortical motor regions. The correlation between the reaction times measures and GABA  receptor density in the anatomically defined Precentral Gyrus ( ) were not significant neither in the left (GABA  vs. reaction times in the 3-back task: rho\u2009=\u2009\u22120.41,   P  \u2009=\u20090.25; GABA  vs. reaction times difference between the 3- and 1-back tasks: rho\u2009=\u2009\u22120.44,   P  \u2009=\u20090.20) nor the right hemisphere (GABA  vs. reaction times in the 3-back task: rho\u2009=\u2009\u22120.58,   P  \u2009=\u20090.088; GABA  vs. reaction times difference between the 3- and 1-back tasks: rho\u2009=\u2009\u22120.55,   P  \u2009=\u20090.10). The whole brain analysis of the relationship between reaction times and GABA -receptor density did reveal smaller significant clusters within the precentral gyrus, but these did not survive correction for multiple comparisons (see  ). \n  \nCorrelation (Spearman\u2019s rho) between GABA -receptor density and reaction times during the WM tasks in the ROIs identified based modulation of activity as a function of memory load. The tested reaction-time measures represent the correct responses in the 3-back task (RT) and the difference between the correct responses in 3- and 1-back tasks (RT difference). See   for the anatomical descriptions, sizes, Brodmann areas, and Talairach coordinates of the ROIs. For visualization purposes, the volumetric data are projected to the surface of the brain. \n  \n\n\n## Results in other frequency bands \n  \nWe also tested whether the amplitude or frequency properties of oscillations in other bands (theta, alpha, beta) would show any correlations with the receptor density in regions that exhibit memory load-dependent activity within these frequency bands (see   and  ). Across the ROIs identified in the theta, alpha, and beta bands, no significant correlations were detected between neural activity and GABA  receptor density (see  ). \n\n### Extension to more general task-based modulations (WM TASK vs. REST) \n  \nThe primary focus in this study has been on brain regions that exhibit memory load-dependent brain activity modulations, i.e. areas identified by comparing the activity between the 3- and 2-back conditions to the 1-back condition. However, for completeness, we also contrasted the WM task condition to resting data in order to identify regions more generally involved in the WM task (see   and  ). These TASK vs. REST analyses revealed that in the Middle Occipital Gyrus, GABA -receptor density correlated positively with the gamma-band peak frequency and negatively with the BOLD amplitude (see  ), which is in line with and confirms observations reported in previous studies ( ;  ). This analysis also revealed a positive correlation between the BOLD amplitude and GABA -receptor density in the left Inferior Parietal Lobule. In several of the ROIs identified based on the modulation of gamma-band or BOLD activity (Postcentral Gyrus, Inferior Parietal Lobule, Middle Occipital Gyrus), significant correlations (see   and  ) were detected between the GABA -receptor density and reaction times as well as between the BOLD amplitude and reaction times in one ROI (Middle Occipital Gyrus). \n\n\n### Joint influence of imaging measures on behavior \n  \nWe also examined using multiple linear stepwise backward regression whether the different imaging measures would jointly explain the variability in the behavioral measures across the ROIs identified based on the WM-load dependent as well as TASK vs. REST modulations. The analysis revealed that for isolated ROI and behavioral measure combinations the behavioral variability could be better explained by two vs. one imaging measure (see   for full list of significant/marginally significant findings). Such findings were made for the combination of GABA  receptor density estimates with both MEG and fMRI amplitude, and for several behavioral measures (reaction times difference, accuracy, sensitivity). This was particularly the case for cluster in the Postcentral gyrus (identified in MEG TASK vs. REST contrast), in which the best linear model for explaining both accuracy and sensitivity consisted of the GABA  receptor density and MEG amplitude modulation. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe combined fMRI, MEG, and FMZ-PET-based estimates of GABA  receptor density within the same subject cohort to probe the relationships between GABAergic inhibition, hemodynamic modulations and oscillatory activity, in an attempt to achieve a more holistic view of the neural mechanisms underlying WM. Our primary goal was to elucidate the relationship between the neural activity, hemodynamics and neurotransmitter measures in higher-order regions, a question that has previously been addressed in humans primarily only in sensory and motor regions. In contrast to previous work, we focused specifically on regions showing modulation of activity as a function of WM load and found that GABA -receptor density correlated positively with the peak frequency of gamma-band power modulations and negatively with BOLD amplitude in such areas. Interestingly, when we compared the different neural measures to behavioral parameters, we found significant correlations exclusively between the GABA  receptor density and WM reaction times in the Inferior Parietal Lobule, Temporo-Parietal Junction and Medial/Middle Frontal Gyrus. These observations align well with our hypotheses building on previous studies examining the relationship between gamma-band activity and GABA in primary sensory cortices ( ;  ), GABA and BOLD dynamics ( ), and the importance of the GABAergic system of explaining the individual task-performance ( ). Our findings demonstrate that GABAergic inhibition is central in shaping gamma oscillations and hemodynamic activity in higher-order regions and in explaining the between-subject performance variability on the WM task. \n\nContrasting high vs. low memory load conditions revealed modulation of gamma-band activity in the bilateral Cuneus and Medial/Middle Frontal Gyrus. In both regions, the gamma peak modulation frequency (but not amplitude) correlated with the GABA  receptor density measured in the same areas at rest. Significant correlation between the GABA  receptor density and gamma peak frequency was detected also in the Poscentral Gyrus, which showed modulation of activity in TASK vs. REST. These findings extend previous neuroimaging results in the primary visual cortex ( ;  ) as well as from animal and modeling studies supporting the role GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the generation and shaping of gamma-band oscillations ( ;  ;  ). Importantly, our findings indicate that the mechanisms of gamma-band oscillations follow the same principles in higher-order human cortical regions as seen in the primary sensory regions as well in animal models. Notably, for the present data, the gamma-band peak frequency was best identified via the ratio of neural activity between high and low WM load conditions (see   and  ). These spectra revealed also potentially interesting differences across subjects, with single and multiple peaks within the gamma bands as well as differences in the presence of sustained high-frequency (>100\u00a0Hz) activity. Accordingly, the gamma-band modulation spectra show effects other than the main peak frequency whose relationship with the GABAergic system was not explored within the present study. Interestingly, the original findings demonstrating link between the GABAergic system and gamma oscillations in humans using MRS-based estimates of GABA concentration ( ) were not replicated when the same phenomena were studied in a larger cohort ( ). Here, as in our previous study ( ), we used PET-FMZ based estimates of GABA  receptor density and detected correlations between the gamma-band peak modulation frequency and receptor density in both higher- and lower-order brain regions. This suggests that the PET-FMZ based estimation of GABAergic system may provide a better proxy than the MRS based estimates which do not dissociate the contributions of the neurotransmitter metabolic pool from the synaptic pool ( ). This notion aligns with the high test\u2013retest reliability of PET-FMZ based measurements ( ). The present finding should, however, be replicated in a larger cohort to corroborate the value of PET-FMZ based quantification of the GABAergic system for evaluating the generation of gamma-band oscillations. It should also be noted that the synaptic specificity of FMZ is limited as it binds also to extrasynaptic subunits of GABA-BZD receptors. Specific synaptic properties could potentially be better captured by using the inverse agonist GABA-BZD receptor PET tracer [11C]Ro15-4513 ( ). Here, we interpreted according to the common view that the PET-based estimates that depend on the binding of FMZ to the \u03b1-subtype of GABA  receptors to represent GABA  receptor density. While these estimates can be influenced by, e.g. extrasynaptic binding, animal studies suggest that the FMZ-based estimates measure accurately the occupancy of the \u03b1-subtype of GABA  receptors ( ). Moreover, within the present cohort of healthy subjects there should not be subject-specific losses of pyramidal neurons that may also underlie differences in GABA  receptor density estimates across subject populations ( ). Thus, while the receptor density estimates could be improved by using, e.g. [11C]Ro15-4513, the PET-FMZ based measure used in the present study should represent specifically GABA  receptor density as opposed to other neuronal properties. However, the present data do not allow us to identify possible reasons for the observed variability in the receptor density across subjects. It should also be noted that in the present study the focus was on examining the relationships between different neural measures in ROIs that average the GABA  receptor density estimates across extended sets of voxels. Accordingly, the analyses are insensitive to local variations in different neural properties such as synaptic and extrasynaptic binding. For spatially more detailed examinations the specificity of the PET binding agent might play a larger role. Moreover, in such investigations, it could be beneficial to maximize the resolutions of the MEG and fMRI estimates by, e.g. using realistic conductor models in MEG and higher field strengths in fMRI. \n\nPrevious studies have shown that BOLD amplitude correlates negatively with GABA concentration in several cortical regions ( ;  ;  ). Here, we detected the same phenomenon in the higher-order regions showing modulation of BOLD activity as a function of memory load (left Parietal Cortex and bilateral Precuneus) as well in the Middle Occipital Gyrus that showed modulation of activity in TASK vs. REST. This demonstrates that the PET-FMZ-based measure of GABA  receptor density facilitates the study of the relationship between the GABAergic system and hemodynamics, allowing such investigations to be conducted with improved spatial resolution compared with MRS-based studies. However, the observed relationship between BOLD and GABA  receptor density was not as robust as for the MEG ROIs, as significant correlations were detected in three of the four MEG ROIs but only in three of the eleven fMRI ROIs. This suggests either that PET-FMZ-based estimates do not sufficiently capture the GABAergic underpinnings of BOLD dynamics, or that due to the specific properties and complexity of the BOLD response ( ;  ), the relationship between GABA  receptor density and BOLD response is not as straightforward as between gamma-band oscillations and receptor density. Furthermore, it is possible that the use of 1.5\u00a0T scanner compared with scanners with higher field strengths may have reduced the sensitivity of the fMRI analyses, leading to underrepresentation of the link between BOLD dynamics and the GABAergic system in the present study. \n\nIn neuroimaging studies, the GABAergic system has been linked previously to various behavioral measures such as orientation discrimination, perceptual acuity and dynamics, time perception and subconscious motor processing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Notably, it has been shown that in visual competition, the concentration of GABA in the frontal eye field correlated negatively with the subject\u2019s motor decision speed ( ). This observation aligns with our findings that GABA  receptor density in several higher-order regions (Inferior Parietal Lobule, Temporo-Parietal Junction and Medial/Middle Frontal Gyrus) correlated negatively with reaction times in the WM task. However, in contrast to the study by Sumner et\u00a0al. ( ), the speed of WM task performance in our study correlated with properties of the GABAergic system in higher-order regions that do not directly control muscle movements. This finding suggests that GABAergic properties of regions responsible for the storage and manipulation of items in WM also affects the speed of processing in n-back tasks, likely via facilitation of the related decision making. This notion is further supported by our observation of a negative correlation between GABA  receptor density and reaction times in regions showing modulation of activity for TASK vs. REST. Here, significant correlations were detected in the Postcentral Gyrus, Middle Occipital Gyrus and Inferior Parietal Lobule\u2014regions that do not directly control the motor output either. In our study, we did not observe significant correlation between GABA  receptor density in the precentral gyrus and reaction-time measures, indicating that performance in the WM task (as measured by the reaction times) is more driven by properties of higher-order brain areas supporting WM than by regions directly controlling the motor output. Nor did we detect any significant correlations between GABA  receptor density and other behavioral measures (accuracy, specificity, sensitivity). One possible explanation for this is that the other behavioral scores show markedly less variability across subjects than reaction time measures, and that to capture these effects, a larger cohort of subjects would have been required. Along the same lines, no significant correlations were detected between the other behavioral measures and modulations of gamma-band and BOLD activity in higher-order cortical regions. However, while we did not detect significant correlations between MEG and behavioral measures, in two of the four MEG ROIs (Cuneus, Postcentral Gyrus), the correlations between gamma-band amplitude and accuracy, sensitivity and specificity scores were predominantly negative, aligning with previous findings ( ). We also applied multiple stepwise backward linear regression to test whether the imaging measures would jointly explain the behavioral variability in task performance. Such effects were detected particularly for the MEG ROIs identified via the TASK vs. REST contrast, for which the reaction times difference was best explained by the joint information in gamma-amplitude and GABA  receptor density in both the Middle Occipital Gyrus and right Parietal lobule and where the task accuracy was best explained by the joint information in gamma-amplitude and GABA  receptor density in the right Parietal Lobule. These finding pose the interesting notion that the static properties of the GABAergic system (here GABA  receptor density) and task-specific neural modulations would jointly predict how well an individual performs in WM tasks. However, considering the small number of these findings across the conducted tests, their moderate statistical significance and the small sample size of the study, this interpretation should be taken with caution. \n\nThe different neural signaling measures (oscillations, hemodynamics, GABA) we examined have all been studied extensively within the field of WM and memory function. For these measures, we detected significant correlations with behavior almost exclusively for GABA  receptor density, demonstrating the importance of the GABAergic system in WM and memory function. Work on freely moving and behaving mice and rats has demonstrated that cholecystokinin-expressing GABAergic neurons and GABA  signaling in astrocytes influence memory behaviors including WM ( ;  ). In human studies, GABA concentration in the occipital cortex, perigenual anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been shown to correlate with changes in WM task accuracy between low and high memory load conditions ( ;  ). In the present study, we found that GABA  receptor density correlated both with reactions times in the highest load condition as well as with reaction-time differences between high and low load conditions (3- vs. 1-back). These effects were detected in the parietal and prefrontal cortices as well as in the temporo-parietal junction, highlighting that the effect of the GABAergic system on WM performance spans wide cortical networks. Moreover, they demonstrate that properties of the GABAergic system influence multiple aspects of WM task performance. Notably, previous studies have shown that in addition to GABA signaling, the amplitude of oscillatory activity\u2014especially in the beta- and gamma-band\u2014correlates with WM task accuracy ( ;  ). While we did not replicate these findings, we saw tendencies of this phenomenon in the gamma band for the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity measures. This suggests the possibility that high-frequency oscillations critically support WM task performance beyond direct inhibitory mechanisms but that the detection of these effects requires a larger cohort of subjects than for the link between WM performance and PET-FMZ-based estimates of GABA  receptor density. It should also be noted that studies in schizophrenia patients have shown that WM can be influenced in more elaborate manners than just via GABA concentration ( ) and that the neuronal architecture of GABAergic inhibitory regulation can vary across cortical regions ( ). Thus, to capture the intricacies of the role of GABAergic signaling in WM, GABA  receptor density measurements should be complemented by other measures that highlight more specific aspects of the GABAergic system. \n\nAlthough the sample size in this study is an obvious limitation, the data provide a very rare opportunity to examine within the same individuals, data collected using MEG, fMRI, and Flu-PET. Because these unique data sets were collected from healthy controls as part of a restricted clinical study on schizophrenia, we were not able to get data from more individuals. We acknowledge that our observations will benefit from replication in the future. Nevertheless, we believe that the statistically significant results reported here provide novel findings that can be useful for current discussions within the cognitive and systems neuroscience communities. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWe simultaneously explored GABA  receptor distributions, electrophysiological and hemodynamic modulations, and task performance in order to advance our understanding of the links between GABAergic inhibition, hemodynamics and oscillatory modulations in higher-order cortical regions, in an attempt to achieve a more holistic view of the neural basis of WM. Our results show that GABA  receptor density correlated both with high-frequency neural oscillations as well as with modulation of hemodynamic activity in several higher-order regions\u2014demonstrating that the generation and shaping of gamma-band oscillations in higher-order brain regions supporting WM follow inhibitory interneuron-dependent principles similar to those that have been observed in primary sensory regions. We also observed that among the different neural signals, estimates of GABAergic neurotransmission\u2014as proxied by GABA  receptor density\u2014were the most predictive measure of behavioral variability in WM across subjects. Taken together, our findings provide key systems neuroscience insights into the role of GABAergic inhibition in shaping neural dynamics in higher-order cortical regions and WM performance. This work paves the way for future studies with larger cohorts that could further delineate on a larger scale the links between synaptic neurotransmission, neuronal oscillations, and hemodynamic brain activity in healthy cognition as well as in neurological and psychiatric conditions. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: TB1\n### Label: Table 1\nROI\tROI size\tBrain region\tBrodmann\tL/R\tx\ty\tz\nMEG1\t248.0\tCuneus\t18\tL/R\t\u22121\t\u221270\t21\nMEG2\t737.0\tMedial Frontal Gyrus\t6\tL/R\t\u22121\t15\t44\n\t\tMiddle Frontal Gyrus\t9\tR\t40\t27\t30\nfMRI1\t1567.0\tPrecentral Gyrus\t6\tL\t\u221250\t\u22123\t46\n\t\tMiddle Frontal Gyrus\t46\tL\t\u221241\t18\t22\nfMRI2\t1157.0\tPrecuneus\t7\tL/R\t\u221210\t\u221265\t46\nfMRI3\t407.0\tInferior Parietal Lobule\t40\tR\t43\t\u221238\t41\nfMRI4\t998.0\tSuperior Frontal Gyrus\t6\tR\t21\t12\t59\nfMRI5\t404.0\tTemporo-Parietal Junction\t13\tR\t40\t\u221225\t11\n### Caption\nROIs identified based on MEG and fMRI data (MEG1: 500\u20131000\u00a0ms; MEG2: 1000\u20131500\u00a0ms).\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: TB2\n### Label: Table 2\nBehavioral measure\t1-back\t2-back\t3-back\nCorrect responses\t113.8\t114.5\t92.3\nIncorrect responses\t1.6\t3.6\t16.5\nAccuracy\t0.986\t0.969\t0.847\nSensitivity\t0.964\t0.926\t0.717\nSpecificity\t0.998\t0.99\t0.899\nReaction times (ms) (correct responses)\t356.4\t445.6\t486.7\nReaction times (ms) (incorrect responses)\t388.7\t527.5\t599.2\n### Caption\nBehavioral performance in the WM tasks.\n### Footer\nNone\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10839845, "text_md5": "43bfc6339ee56ae6391be6d4794eec37", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 171], "journal": [172, 184], "publication_year": [186, 190], "title": [201, 288], "keywords": [302, 417], "abstract": [430, 1909], "body": [1918, 52853], "tables": [52866, 53857]}, "batch": 4, "pmid": 38186005, "doi": "10.1093/cercor/bhad522", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10839845", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10839845"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10839845\">10839845</a>", "list_title": "PMC10839845  GABAergic inhibition shapes behavior and neural dynamics in human visual working memory"}

However, the majority of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in childhood maltreatment have examined emotion processing, while very few studies have tested the neurofunctional substrates of cognitive functions and none of attention. This study investigated the association between severe childhood abuse and fMRI brain activation during a parametric sustained attention task with a progressively increasing load of sustained attention in 21 medication-na\u00efve, drug-free young people with a history of childhood abuse controlling for psychiatric comorbidities by including 19 psychiatric controls matched for psychiatric diagnoses, and 27 healthy controls. Behaviorally, the participants exposed to childhood abuse showed increased omission errors in the task which correlated positively trend-wise with the duration of their abuse. Neurofunctionally, the participants with a history of childhood abuse, but not the psychiatric controls, displayed significantly reduced activation relative to the healthy controls during the most challenging attention condition only in typical attention regions including left inferior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insula and temporal areas. We therefore show for the first time that severe childhood abuse is associated with neurofunctional abnormalities in key ventral frontal-temporal sustained attention regions. The findings represent a first step towards the delineation of abuse-related neurofunctional abnormalities in sustained attention, which may help in the development of effective treatments for victims of childhood abuse. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThere is increasing interest in understanding the effects of childhood adversities on the developing brain, given evidence that early environmental factors can have a substantial influence on the emerging brain architecture and long-term health of the person [ ]. Childhood maltreatment, including physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect is common in the United Kingdom with pediatric prevalence rates of 7\u201310% [ ]. Furthermore, childhood adversities are significantly associated with first onsets of various psychiatric disorders including mood, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) [ ]. \n\nThe psychopathological outcomes associated with childhood maltreatment may be mediated by the disruption of cognitive processes and their associated neural underpinnings [ ]. Childhood maltreatment has been associated with adverse cognitive consequences such as low IQ and poor academic performance alongside impaired functions of motor and interference inhibition, sustained and selective attention, emotion and reward processing [ , ]. In particular, several neuropsychological studies have reported auditory [ , ] and visual [ \u2013 ] attention deficits in childhood maltreatment. Sustained attention, the ability to keep one\u2019s mind continuously focused on a particular task, is a key dimension of attention control [ ]. It is important for mature adult goal-directed behavior, thought to underpin \u201chigher-level\u201d attention processes such as selective and divided attention as well as general cognitive ability [ ]. Children with maltreatment-related PTSD [ ] and institutionalized children made more omission errors compared to healthy controls during sustained attention tasks, which was furthermore related to longer institutional care [ , ]. In adults, childhood physical abuse and neglect have also been associated with sustained attention deficits [ ]. Additionally, population-based studies report significant associations between childhood maltreatment and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) like inattentive symptoms [ , ]. \n\nDespite the consistent neuropsychological findings of attention deficits in individuals with a history of childhood maltreatment, no fMRI study, to date, has examined sustained attention in this population The majority of fMRI studies in childhood maltreatment have examined brain function during emotion processing, given neuropsychological evidence of an attention bias and an increased sensitivity to angry and fearful expressions in maltreated children [ \u2013 ] and adults [ ]. These studies found abnormally enhanced activation of fronto-limbic regions in response to negative emotions, in particular to angry and fearful facial expressions, in maltreated children/adolescents [ \u2013 ] and adults [ \u2013 ] relative to healthy controls, suggesting behavioral and neurofunctional hypersensitivity to fear and anger. \n\nHowever, very few fMRI studies have tested cognitive processes known as \u201cexecutive functions\u201d which are particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of stress [ ]. Executive functions include facets of high-order cognitions such as inhibition, working memory and sustained attention [ ]. Using motor inhibition tasks, young people with a history of childhood maltreatment showed increased activation in inferior frontal cortex (IFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during successful inhibition [ , ] and in typical dorsomedial prefrontal/ACC error-processing regions during failed inhibition [ ]. In adults, a history of childhood maltreatment was associated with decreased functional connectivity of IFC and dorsal ACC during successful inhibition, which was furthermore related to impulsiveness and inattentive symptoms [ ]. Using visual/verbal working memory tasks, childhood physical abuse was associated with reduced left cortical functioning in the frontal and temporal lobes in adults who were severely abused during childhood [ ]. Also, higher levels of early childhood stress were associated with poorer spatial working memory in adolescents, and this relationship was mediated by smaller grey matter volume in the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) near the ACC and frontal poles [ ]. \n\nFurthermore, a recent meta-analysis of structural MRI studies and reviews of both structural and functional MRI studies in childhood maltreatment show that individuals exposed to childhood maltreatment have deficits predominantly in two neuronal systems; one consisting of orbitofrontal-limbic circuits of top-down affect control, and another in the ventral attention system, in particular the ventral PFC, which is crucial for top-down cognitive control and sustained attention [ , \u2013 ]. Hence, the findings suggest that the frontal-limbic regions are compromised both at the structural level and functional level during emotional processing in childhood maltreatment. On a similar vein, the findings that the (ventral) PFC is compromised anatomically [ , ] and functionally during executive functions in childhood abuse [ \u2013 , ] and that structural deficits in the PFC mediated the relationship between childhood stress and poorer working memory [ ] seem to suggest that that the ventral PFC may also be functionally impaired during sustained attention. \n\nThe aim of this study was therefore to test the hypothesis that medication-na\u00efve, drug-free young people with a documented history of childhood physical abuse would exhibit activation deficits during sustained attention. Given that the fronto-parieto-temporal regions that mediate sustained attention develop relatively late in childhood and have been shown to be progressively more activated with increasing age between childhood and adulthood in fMRI studies [ , ], it is conceivable that childhood maltreatment interferes with the normal functional development of the ventral attention network. For this purpose, we used a parametrically modulated vigilance task requiring target detection with a progressively increasing load of sustained attention. Sexual abuse was excluded as it has been associated with different brain structure [ ], behavioral and psychiatric consequences [ \u2013 ]. In particular, both childhood physical abuse and neglect, but not sexual abuse, were associated with alterations in regional corpus callosum size [ ] and with grey matter reduction in a distributed corticostriatal-limbic system [ ]. In terms of psychiatric and behavioral effects, childhood sexual but not physical abuse was associated with suicidal behaviour [ ], self-injury [ ], adulthood sexual dysfunction [ ], and having at least two symptoms of schizophrenia [ ]. Youth with childhood sexual abuse also reported more externalizing and internalizing problems over time than maltreated but non-sexually abused youth [ ], and victims of childhood sexual abuse reported more severe mental pain compared with physical abuse victims [ ]. Scholars have also argued that childhood sexual abuse is associated with experiences or feelings unique to sexual victimization relative to other abuse and neglect experiences; for example, traumatic sexualization, betrayal, stigmatization, attributions of responsibility as well as feelings of guilt and shame collectively may impact victims of childhood sexual abuse more profoundly and/or differently than victims of other abuse experiences [ , ]. For these reasons, and in order to obtain a more homogenous group, we only included children with physical abuse. \n\nHowever, although the current study initially aimed to examine the neural correlates of sustained attention in young people exposed to physical abuse in childhood, it is unrealistic to separate physical abuse from typically co-occurring emotional abuse and neglect [ , ]. Claussen et al even noted that psychological maltreatment would be present in   almost all   cases of physical maltreatment. Hence, it is unlikely for the abused victim to experience   severe   physical abuse without experiencing at least moderate levels of emotional abuse and neglect concurrently; on the other hand, physical abuse does not always co-occur with sexual abuse. \n\nPrevious imaging studies in childhood maltreatment have several limitations such as not formally assessing and controlling for the presence of any co-occurring psychiatric conditions and/or substance abuse as well as the use of region of interest (ROI) analyses [ ] which limits the search to a-priori hypothesized regions and provides a biased and inappropriately constrained characterization of anatomy or function [ ]. In particular, given that large-scale epidemiological and longitudinal studies have consistently found that childhood maltreatment is linked developmentally to psychiatric disorders [ , , ] and a meta-analysis study reported a causal relationship between non-sexual childhood maltreatment and a range of mental disorders [ ], it is crucial to control for these in order to disentangle the effects of maltreatment from those associated with psychopathology [ , \u2013 ]. Additionally, although some studies examined the neural correlates of childhood maltreatment in \u201chealthy\u201d participants [ \u2013 , ], they relied solely on parental and/or participant\u2019s self-ratings on clinical measures; hence, in the absence of a formal psychiatric assessment by a child psychiatrist, it remains unclear if these participants were without any psychiatric disorders at the point of testing. To assess the specificity of the association with childhood abuse, we therefore included a third group of psychiatric controls that was matched with the group with a history of childhood abuse on psychiatric comorbidities. Furthermore, to control for medication use or drug abuse, we included only participants who were drug-abuse free and medication-na\u00efve. In addition, we conducted whole-brain analyses so that areas outside hypothesized regions would not be overlooked. \n\nTherefore, we hypothesized that participants with a documented history of childhood physical abuse would show activation deficits in typical fronto-parieto-temporal sustained attention regions [ ], in particular during the highest load of attention. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSeventy (23 young people with a history of childhood abuse, 20 psychiatric controls, and 27 healthy controls) right-handed, medication-na\u00efve, drug-free and age-matched young people came to the laboratory for two sessions, and those below the age of 18 were accompanied by their guardians on both visits. In the first visit, demographic, clinical and abuse measures and IQ data were collected and the participants were acclimated to the scanner environment with an MRI replica. The fMRI sustained attention task was administered in the MRI scanner on the second visit. All participants were assessed by a child psychiatrist (KM) using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) [ ] designed to generate ICD-10 and DSM-IV psychiatric diagnoses. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ) [ ] and Beck\u2019s Depression Inventory (BDI) [ ] were used to provide psychopathology symptom scores. IQ was assessed using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) [ ]. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) [ ] was used to measure the severity of childhood physical, emotional and sexual abuse as well as emotional and physical neglect. Socioeconomic status (SES) was measured by two non-sensitive items from the Family Affluence Scale (FAS) [ ] on housing tenure and room occupancy. \n\nExclusion criteria for all participants were childhood sexual abuse, drug abuse, learning disability, neurological abnormalities, epilepsy, IQ < 70 and MRI contraindications. Urine screening for recent drug use was conducted with 10-panel urine drug test integrated cups (T-Cup;  ). All participants or their guardians if the participant was under the age of 18, provided written informed consent to participate in the study. Young people below the age of 18 were accompanied by their guardians during each visit and their guardians received the reimbursement for participating in the study on their behalf. The study was approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee London-Fulham. \n\nThe 23 young people who experienced childhood physical abuse before the age of 12 were recruited through social services and psychiatric clinics. These young people, or their guardians if they were below the age of 18, were first asked to provide signed permission to contact their respective social services for written confirmation that there were official records of physical abuse. Next, the young people went on to complete the clinical interviews, abuse measures and IQ test and finally followed by the brain scan. The Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse (CECA) interview [ ] was used to corroborate the CTQ and provide additional information on the abuse experience such as the age or onset and duration of abuse. All the participants with a history of childhood abuse scored \u2265 13 (i.e. the cut-off for severe/extreme physical abuse) [ ] on the CTQ physical abuse subscale, and information from the CECA interview [ ] and the CTQ were consistent with the official records. Psychiatric comorbidities included PTSD, depression, anxiety, conduct disorder and phobia. Two participants were excluded due to MRI motion artefacts, leaving a final sample of 21 participants (mean age 17.5, 15 male). \n\nTwenty psychiatric controls were recruited through social services and psychiatric clinics. They had experienced no maltreatment (CTQ subscale scores of \u2264 7 for physical abuse, \u2264 8 for emotional abuse, \u2264 6 for sexual abuse, \u2264 9 for emotional neglect and \u2264 7 for physical neglect). The purpose of the inclusion of the psychiatric control group was to disentangle the effects due to maltreatment from those due to the psychiatric conditions that are typically associated with maltreatment. Therefore, diagnoses for both psychiatric controls and maltreated participants were made by the same experienced child psychiatrist (KM) using the same instrument, the DAWBA, and diagnoses were matched as closely as possible one-to-one with participants from the group with a history of childhood abuse. If there was any uncertainty regarding DAWBA diagnoses, Professor Robert Goodman, the psychiatrist responsible for the development of the DAWBA, checked and confirmed the diagnosis. The group with a history of childhood abuse and the psychiatric control group were well matched on psychiatric conditions ( ). Where psychiatric controls had PTSD, the causal trauma(s) were unrelated to childhood maltreatment and included bullying by peers, living in Afghanistan during the war, witnessing murder, experiencing a car accident and death of a loved one. One participant was excluded due to motion artefacts, leaving a final sample of 19 patients (mean age 16.9, 9 male). \n   Demographic Characteristic of 21 Young People Exposed to Childhood Abuse, 19 Psychiatric Controls and 27 Healthy Controls.        \nThe 27 healthy controls (mean age 17.5, 21 male) with no history of psychiatric illness and childhood maltreatment (scoring below the same cut-offs as above) were recruited through advertisements in the same geographic areas of South London to ensure similar socioeconomic background ( ). \n\nThe methodology is similar to that reported in an earlier study [ ] as the participants completed two additional fMRI tasks (stop and emotion processing), reported elsewhere [ ]. \n\n\n### fMRI Paradigm: Sustained Attention Task (SAT) \n  \nParticipants practiced the task once prior to scanning. The 12-min SAT is a variant of psychomotor vigilance and delay tasks [ , ]. Participants need to respond as quickly as possible to the appearance of a visual timer counting up in milliseconds via a right hand button response within 1s. The visual stimuli appear either after short, predictable consecutive delays of 0.5s, in series of 3\u20135 stimuli (260 in total), or after unpredictable time delays of 2s, 5s or 8s (20 each), pseudo-randomly interspersed into the blocks of 3\u20135 0.5s delays. The long, infrequent, unpredictable delays place a higher load on sustained attention/vigilance while the short, predictable 0.5s delays are typically anticipated [ ] placing a higher demand on sensorimotor synchronization [ , , ] ( ). \n   Schematic Representation of the Sustained Attention Task.  \nSubjects are required to press a right-hand button as soon as they see a timer appear on the screen counting seconds. The counter appears after either predictable short delays of 0.5s in blocks of 3\u20135 stimuli, or after unpredictable long delays of 2s, 5s or 8s, pseudorandomly interspersed into the blocks of 0.5s delays. The long second delays have a progressively higher load on sustained attention than the short 0.5s delays that are typically anticipated and have a higher load on sensorimotor synchronization. \n  \n\n### Performance Data Analysis \n  \nMultiple repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVAs) with group as independent and delay as repeated measures were conducted to test for group (3 levels: Childhood abuse, Psychiatric controls, Healthy controls), delay (3 levels: 2s, 5s, 8s) and group by delay interaction effects using SPSS 18 on the following measures: mean reaction time (MRT), intra-subject variability of reaction time (SDintrasubject), omission and premature errors. A separate ANOVA for group differences for the short delays (0.5s) was also conducted on the same measures. Bonferroni adjustment was used for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n### fMRI Image Acquisition \n  \nGradient echo echo-planar MR imaging (EPI) data were acquired on a 3T GE Signa HDx system at the Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London. Stimulus images were projected on a screen, clearly visible through prism placed in front of participants\u2019 eyes. The body coil was used for RF transmission and an 8-channel head coil for RF reception. During the 12-minute run of the task, in each of 28 non-contiguous planes parallel to the anterior-posterior commissural, 480 T *-weighted MR images depicting Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast covering the whole brain were acquired with: echo time (TE) = 30ms, repetition time (TR) = 1.5s, 23 slices, flip angle = 70\u00b0, in-plane resolution = 3.75mm , field of view (FOV) = 240mm, slice thickness/gap = 5/0.5mm, matrix = 64 x 64. A high-resolution gradient EPI was also acquired for accurate spatial normalization (TE = 30ms, TR = 3s, 43 slices, flip angle = 90\u00b0, in-plane resolution = 1.875mm , FOV = 240mm, slice thickness/gap = 3/0.3mm, matrix = 128 x 128). \n\n\n### fMRI Image Analysis \n  \nImage preprocessing and whole-brain analyses were carried out using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8,  ). Data were realigned to correct for subject movement and co-registered to the high-resolution gradient EPI, which was then used to estimate the parameters for spatially normalizing the data into a standard anatomical space (Montreal Neurological Institute). The resulting normalized volume time series was spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 8-mm full width at half maximum. \n\nData were analyzed within the framework of the General Linear Model. A single-subject (1  level) model was created for each participant, including regressors encoding each experimental condition (long delays of 2s, 5s and 8s). The 0.5s short delay condition, which was not modelled and was used as an implicit baseline, was identical to the experimental conditions except for the delay period and hence controlled for visual stimulation and sensorimotor activation [ , ]. Each of these long delay conditions was contrasted with the 0.5s short delay condition that formed the implicit baseline. The model only examined correct trials; incorrect trials were omitted from the imaging analysis and included as covariates in the 1  level model so that the variance due to errors can be accounted for and group differences in neural activity during the correct trials do not reflect any group differences in task performance. The movement parameters from the realignment procedure were also included as covariates in the 1  level model. At the group-level, a whole-brain analysis was conducted using the SPM flexible factorial design model to examine the group by delay interaction effect, in which group was a between-subject factor (3 levels: Childhood abuse, Psychiatric controls, Healthy controls) and delay was a within-subject factor (3 levels: 2s, 5s, 8s). BOLD responses are reported using a family-wise error rate (FWE)-corrected cluster threshold of   p   < 0.05 and voxel threshold of   p   < 0.001. Next, mean BOLD contrast values for all voxels of significant clusters from the SPM flexible factorial analysis were extracted using MarsBaR ( ) and a 3 (group) x 3 (delay) repeated-measures ANOVA followed by post-hoc   t  -tests (correcting for multiple comparisons) at each delay were conducted using SPSS 18 to determine between-group differences at each delay. \n\nFinally, the significant clusters were also used to conduct exploratory correlation analyses with potential confounding variables such as IQ and age within each group, and with clinical and abuse measures (severity, age at onset and duration of abuse) within the group with a history of childhood abuse only. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Subject Characteristics \n  \nThe groups did not differ significantly in age, gender, ethnicity and SES but differed significantly in IQ, as expected ( ). Large-scale epidemiological studies have consistently reported an association between childhood maltreatment and lower IQ and cognitive abilities [ \u2013 ]. Therefore, since lower IQ is associated with childhood maltreatment, covarying for IQ when groups are not randomly selected and the covariate is a pre-existing group difference that did not occur by chance violates ANCOVA assumptions [ , ]. The primary data analyses are thus presented without covarying for IQ. However, to rule out any potential influence of IQ, a correlation analysis of IQ with brain activation in significant clusters and an additional confirmatory analysis on a subsample of IQ-matched participants were also conducted (see additional confirmatory analyses). \n\nAlthough the study initially recruited participants with a history of childhood physical abuse, they also experienced marked/severe childhood emotional abuse and neglect ( ), which typically co-occur with physical abuse, and hence are a representative group of the childhood abuse population [ ]. \n\nHealthy controls scored significantly lower on BDI (  p   < 0.01) and all SDQ difficulties subscales (  p   < 0.001) than the group with a history of childhood abuse, as well as on BDI (  p   < 0.001), SDQ emotional problems (  p   < 0.001) and hyperactivity (  p   < 0.05) subscales than psychiatric controls. The group with a history of childhood abuse scored significantly higher than psychiatric controls on SDQ conduct (  p   < 0.01) and peer problems (  p   < 0.05) but lower on prosocial (  p   < 0.01) subscales ( ). \n\n\n### Task Performance \n  \nParalleling the fMRI analyses where the 0.5s delay condition was included as an implicit baseline, and given that the long delay conditions (2s, 5s and 8s) were the targets of interest tapping into vigilance, we analyzed the long delay separately from the short delay conditions to assess effects of group, delay and group by delay interaction. There was no significant group effect on MRT (F (2, 64) = 1.99,   p   = 0.15) and SDintrasubject (F (2, 64) = 1.40,   p   = 0.26). There was a significant group effect on omission (F (2, 64) = 3.16,   p   < 0.05) and premature errors (F (2, 64) = 3.51,   p   < 0.05), due to the group with a history of childhood abuse and psychiatric control group making more omission errors than healthy controls and the group with a history of childhood abuse making more premature errors than healthy controls ( ). There were no significant effects of delay or of group by delay interaction (see Table in   for 0.5s delay results). \n   Performance Measures for the Sustained Attention Task during 2s, 5s and 8s Delays for 21 Young People Exposed to Childhood Abuse, 19 Psychiatric Controls and 27 Healthy Controls.        \n\n### Brain Activation \n  \n#### Motion \n  \nMultivariate ANOVAs showed no significant group differences in maximum translation (Wilks\u2019 Lambda F (6,124) = 1.67,   p   > 0.05) or maximum rotation (Wilks\u2019 Lambda F (6,124) = 1.09,   p   > 0.05) parameters. \n\n\n#### Within Group Activations \n  \nWithin-group activations for each of the 3 delays are shown in   for each of the 3 groups. Briefly, healthy controls across the different delays had activation in a bilateral network comprising the SMA, paracentral lobule, middle and superior frontal gyri, superior temporal gyrus, insula, cingulate, post and precentral gyri, precuneus, cuneus, lingual, middle occipital gyrus, fusiform and cerebellum as well as in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and striatum ( ). The group with a history of childhood abuse had activation in a bilateral network comprising the SMA, paracentral lobule, middle and superior frontal gyri, superior temporal gyrus, insula, cingulate, post and precentral gyri, precuneus, cuneus, lingual, middle occipital gyrus, fusiform and cerebellum ( ). The psychiatric controls had activation in bilateral SMA, paracentral lobule, post and precentral gyri, precuneus, cingulate, insula and superior temporal gyrus ( ). \n   Group by Delay Interaction Effect on Brain Activation in Healthy Controls, Young People Exposed to Childhood Abuse and Psychiatric Controls.  \n A)   Axial sections showing group by delay interaction effect on brain activation during sustained attention in 27 healthy controls, 21 young people exposed to childhood abuse and 19 psychiatric controls as revealed by F test,   p   < 0.05 FWE-corrected at the cluster-level. Axial slices are marked with the z coordinate as distance in millimetres from the anterior\u2013posterior commissure. The right side of the image corresponds to the right side of the brain.   B)   fMRI BOLD contrast values in Cluster 1 left IFC/DLPFC and Cluster 2 left temporal/fusiform gyrus for the healthy control group (green), childhood abuse group (blue) and psychiatric control group (red) during the 8s delay condition. The group with a history of childhood abuse had significantly lower activation in the left IFC/DLPFC cluster (p<0.05) and at a trend-level in the left temporal/fusiform cluster (p = 0.09) compared to heathy controls. There were no significant differences between the psychiatric and healthy controls. \n  \n\n#### Group Effect \n  \nWhen all 3 delays were considered together, there were no significant group differences across all delays (see   for brain activations within each group and   for the main effect of delay). \n\n\n#### Group by Delay Interaction Effect \n  \nAs hypothesized, there was, however, a significant group by delay interaction effect in two clusters: The first cluster comprised left IFC, anterior insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (  p   < 0.001). The second cluster comprised left inferior and middle temporal and fusiform areas (  p   < 0.001). Post-hoc analyses at each delay showed that the group with a history of childhood abuse had significantly reduced activation relative to healthy controls during the longest (8s) delay in the IFC cluster (  p   < 0.05) and at a trend-level in the temporal cluster (  p   = 0.09); however, they did not differ from psychiatric controls who did not differ from healthy controls ( ,  ). \n   Group by Delay Interaction Effect on Brain Activation between 21 Young People Exposed to Childhood Abuse, 19 Psychiatric Controls and 27 Healthy Controls.        \n\n#### Correlation Analyses \n  \nTo investigate whether the significant clusters of activation differences were associated with the main attention performance measure of omission errors and with clinical and abuse measures, BOLD values of each cluster for the 8s delay\u2014with the greatest group differences\u2014were extracted for each participant and correlated with omission errors at 8s within each group and with clinical and abuse measures (severity, age at onset and duration of abuse) within the group with a history of childhood abuse only. \n\nFor healthy controls, omission errors correlated negatively with activation in the IFC cluster (r = -0.69,   p   < 0.001) and temporal cluster (r = -0.55,   p   < 0.01). No significant correlations between omission errors and activation were observed in the group with a history of childhood abuse and the psychiatric control group. For the group with a history of childhood abuse, omission errors correlated at a trend-level positively with the duration of abuse (r = 0.4,   p   = 0.06). There were no significant associations between brain activation and age of onset/duration of abuse or SDQ symptoms scores in the group with a history of childhood abuse. \n\n\n#### Additional (Confirmatory) Analyses \n  \nGiven that the group with a history of childhood abuse had significantly lower IQ than healthy controls, IQ was correlated with brain activation in the significant clusters and with the main performance measure of omission errors within each group. There were no significant correlations between IQ and brain activation or between IQ and omission errors ( ). Hence, higher brain activation or lesser omission error is not related to higher IQ and vice versa. Moreover, in order to further rule out the confounding effect of IQ on the findings, the analysis was repeated within a subgroup of IQ-matched sample (19 young people exposed to childhood abuse, 19 psychiatric controls and 18 healthy controls). All main findings remained significant in the IQ-matched subsample ( ). Hence, IQ differences were unlikely to explain the findings. \n   Correlations between Brain Activation, Task Performance, IQ and Age for 21 Young People Exposed to Childhood Abuse, 19 Psychiatric Controls and 27 Healthy Control .           Group by Delay Interaction Effect on Brain Activation during Sustained Attention in an IQ-matched subsample of Healthy Controls, Young People Exposed to Childhood abuse and Psychiatric Controls.  \nAxial sections showing group by delay interaction effect on brain activation during sustained attention in a subsample of 18 healthy controls, 19 young people exposed to childhood abuse and 19 psychiatric controls matched on IQ, as revealed by F test,   p   < 0.05 FWE-corrected at the cluster-level. Axial slices are marked with the z coordinate as distance in millimetres from the anterior\u2013posterior commissure. The right side of the image corresponds to the right side of the brain. \n  \nFurthermore, given that many individuals in the group with a history of childhood abuse suffered from PTSD, which was matched in the psychiatric control group, we wanted to explore whether PTSD alone was associated with potential brain activation abnormalities. For this purpose, we compared the 25 PTSD patients with the 27 healthy controls and with the 42 participants without PTSD. There were no significant group differences suggesting that the functional abnormalities are related to the abuse experience rather than PTSD. \n\nFinally, we also controlled for variables such as gender, ethnicity and SES. The main findings remained significant when the extracted BOLD values of significant clusters were analyzed using repeated-measures ANCOVA in SPSS 18 covarying for these measures of gender, ethnicity and SES. Also, age did not correlate significantly with activation in the significant clusters or with omission errors within each group ( ). Thus, subtle and non-significant variations in these demographic factors were unlikely to have confounded the findings. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first fMRI study that examined the neurofunctional correlates of sustained attention in severe physical childhood abuse. We found that in a parametrically designed sustained attention task, medication-na\u00efve and drug-free young people with a history of childhood physical abuse and concomitant neglect and emotion abuse relative to healthy controls exhibited increased omission errors, the main attention measure of the task, which furthermore was associated with a longer duration of abuse at a trend-level. At the neurofunctional level, only the group with a history of childhood abuse but not the psychiatric control group had reduced activation relative to healthy controls during the most challenging attention condition, the longest delay, in the ventral and dorsal frontal attention regions of left IFC, anterior insula and DLPFC as well as at a trend-level in middle and inferior temporal and fusiform areas. \n\nYoung people with a history of childhood physical abuse most of who also had neglect and emotional abuse showed reduced activation relative to healthy controls during the most challenging attention condition in left hemispheric ventral and dorsolateral prefrontal regions that are known to be important for sustained attention such as IFC/anterior insula and DLPFC [ , , \u2013 ]. The anterior insula is implicated in high-level cognitive control and attention processes [ ] and together with IFC forms part of the ventral attention and salience network that facilitates the detection of important environmental stimuli, in this case the target stimuli [ , ]. The anterior insular/IFC network is thought to be involved in signaling the need for attentional effort to facilitate target detection, particularly under the more challenging condition of longer delays to prevent attentional drifts away from the task at hand [ , ]. The DLPFC plays a crucial role in top-down attention and is activated during visuospatial information processing and orienting of attention [ , ], including in this particular task version [ , , ]. Finally, the temporal and inferior occipito-temporal regions are known to be involved in bottom-up visuospatial attention processes [ , ]. The implication of these fronto-temporal regions in sustained attention is furthermore reinforced in this study as they were negatively correlated with omission errors in healthy controls, suggesting that the higher the activation the better the task performance. Our findings therefore suggest that young people with a history of childhood abuse have a deficit in top-down IFC/DLPFC attention control and at a trend-level in bottom-up visuospatial attention processing. \n\nThe neurofunctional deficits during the longest delay may be abuse-related as they were not observed in the psychiatric control group, who did not differ from either the healthy control group or the group with a history of childhood abuse. This suggests that neurofunctional deficits in attention functions may be associated with abuse but also transfer to psychiatric complications. The findings of impairment in the most difficult condition only furthermore suggest that neurofunctional abnormalities during sustained attention in young people exposed to childhood abuse are intact in easier task conditions and manifest only during the most challenging condition. This is interesting in view of neurofunctional deficits in the same region of left DLPFC in this task in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and ADHD [ , ] during all delay conditions. It suggests less pervasive neurofunctional attention deficits in childhood abuse relative to other childhood disorders of attention, as they only manifested during the most challenging attention condition and were not observed throughout all task conditions. \n\nThe human brain is plastic and is continually modified by experience across development. Given that the IFC, DLPFC and temporal lobes are among the latest brain regions to develop structurally [ ] and functionally [ ], developing well into mid-adulthood, they may well be more susceptible to impairment following childhood adversity. In fact, our review [ ] and a recent meta-analysis of structural MRI studies [ ] in childhood abuse found grey matter abnormalities in the IFC, superior frontal and temporal regions. Furthermore, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies in childhood maltreatment also reported abnormalities in left hemispheric fronto-temporal white matter tracts, including the uncinate fasciculus [ ], arcuate fasciculus [ ] as well as the inferior [ ] and superior longitudinal fasciculus [ ]. Hence, functional abnormalities in these late-developing IFC/DLPFC and temporal regions during sustained attention may suggest an environmentally triggered disturbance in the normal development of these attention networks as a consequence of childhood abuse. \n\nAt the performance level, the group with a history of childhood abuse made more omission errors than healthy controls, which was furthermore correlated with a longer duration of abuse. This is consistent with previous neuropsychological findings of more omission errors during sustained attention tasks in children with maltreatment-related PTSD [ ] and in children with longer institutional care [ ]. Furthermore, the frontal-temporal attention regions that were reduced in activation in the group with a history of childhood abuse during the longest delay condition were associated with less omission errors in healthy controls, suggesting that normally these regions are recruited for better performance while poor performance in the group with a history of childhood abuse may be due to poor recruitment of these regions. \n\nThe strength of this study is that all participants were medication-na\u00efve, drug-free and that the physical abuse experience was carefully assessed and corroborated by social service records. Also, we included a psychiatric control group to determine the specificity of abuse. The inclusion of a \u201cpure\u201d group with a history of childhood physical abuse without any psychiatric disorders would have been a stronger control group to determine abuse-specific deficits; however, they would not be representative of the general childhood abuse populations as severe abuse is typically associated with psychiatric comorbidities [ , \u2013 ]. Another limitation is that although the initial focus of the study was on childhood physical abuse, and sexual abuse was excluded as it has been shown to differ in many aspects [ ], including distinctive effects on the somatosensory cortex [ ], we cannot categorically state that the observed effects are a result of physical abuse exclusively as many participants also experienced neglect and emotional abuse. However, it is unrealistic to separate physical abuse from emotional abuse and neglect as the vast majority of maltreated children are subjected to more than one kind of abuse, with less than 5% of maltreatment occurring in isolation [ , ]. Moreover, using child protective services case records abstraction (physical, sexual, emotional abuse and neglect), latent class analysis revealed four distinctive profiles of childhood maltreatment experiences in which physical abuse was clustered with 1) neglect, 2) emotional abuse, 3) both neglect and emotional abuse and 4) neglect, emotional abuse and sexual abuse [ ]. Thus, there is a high degree of overlap among childhood physical abuse, emotional abuse and neglect but the abused victim may not necessary had experienced sexual abuse. Nonetheless, it is worth noting the limitation in generalizing the current findings to individuals with a history of childhood sexual abuse. \n\nThe fact that IQ was not matched between the groups could be considered a limitation. However, since there was no significant correlation between IQ and brain activation in the two significant clusters and the findings remained in an additional confirmatory analysis on a subsample of IQ-matched participants, this suggests that IQ is unlikely to have confounded the findings. The lack of pubertal information is also a limitation given the significant development that occurs over this age range, particularly in the domain of executive functions. Also, it is unclear to what extent malnutrition, prenatal drug exposure and the presence of current life stressors may have influenced the findings. Finally, it is worth noting that comprehensive SES information has not been retrieved from parent/carer or social service report. \n\n### Conclusions \n  \nIn summary, we found that medication-na\u00efve, drug-free young people with a history of childhood abuse, but not psychiatric controls, had functional activation deficits in typical sustained attention regions of IFC, DLPFC, insula and temporal areas compared to healthy controls during the longest and most challenging delay condition only. The findings represent a first step towards the delineation of abuse-related neurofunctional abnormalities in sustained attention, which may help in the development of effective treatments that target these regions. \n\n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone.0165547.t001\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tChildhood Abuse(N = 21)\tChildhood Abuse(N = 21)\tPsychiatric Controls(N = 19)\tPsychiatric Controls(N = 19)\tHealthy Controls(N = 27)\tHealthy Controls(N = 27)\tAnalysis\tAnalysis\tAnalysis\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tMean\tSD\tMean\tSD\tMean\tSD\tF(2, 64)\tp (corr.)\tGroup Comparisons\nAge (years) [age range:13\u201320]\t17.5\t2.32\t16.9\t2.48\t17.5\t1.63\t0.58\t0.56\t-\nSocioeconomic status\t2.77\t0.69\t2.94\t0.66\t3.22\t0.75\t2.43\t0.10\t-\nIQ\t90.0\t12.6\t93.6\t13.0\t105.4\t10.1\t11.3\t0.001\tCA, PC < HC\nStrengths and Difficulties Questionnaire:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEmotional problems\t4.62\t2.77\t4.95\t2.95\t1.92\t1.61\t10.5\t<0.001\tCA, PC > HC\nConduct problems\t4.43\t2.01\t2.37\t2.36\t1.68\t1.60\t11.5\t<0.001\tCA > PC, HC\nHyperactivity\t5.38\t2.40\t4.68\t2.65\t2.84\t2.14\t7.08\t0.002\tCA, PC > HC\nPeer problems\t3.81\t1.54\t2.37\t2.03\t1.16\t1.72\t12.9\t<0.001\tCA > PC, HC\nProsocial\t7.24\t1.70\t8.63\t1.64\t8.08\t1.41\t3.99\t0.02\tCA< PC\nTotal difficulties score\t18.2\t6.20\t14.4\t6.34\t7.60\t5.73\t18.2\t<0.001\tCA, PC > HC\nBeck\u2019s Depression Inventory\t16.0\t10.6\t21.1\t12.1\t5.92\t6.09\t8.32\t< 0.001\tCA, PC > HC\nChildhood Trauma Questionnaire:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPhysical abuse\t20.8\t5.04\t6.21\t1.58\t5.52\t0.94\t117.4\t<0.001\tCA > PC, HC\nEmotional abuse\t18.0\t4.40\t7.11\t1.79\t6.04\t1.13\t94.4\t<0.001\tCA > PC, HC\nSexual abuse\t5.14\t0.65\t5.39\t0.78\t5.11\t0.42\t1.18\t0.31\t-\nPhysical neglect\t14.0\t5.02\t6.74\t2.26\t5.59\t1.22\t36.9\t<0.001\tCA > PC, HC\nEmotional neglect\t18.3\t3.93\t8.79\t3.69\t7.93\t3.35\t50.7\t<0.001\tCA > PC, HC\nAge at onset of (physical)abuse (years)\t4.24\t2.55\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDuration of (physical) abuse(years)\t8.29\t3.20\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tN\t%\tN\t%\tN\t%\t\u03c72\tp\tGroup Comparisons\nGender (Males)\t15\t71\t9\t47\t21\t77\t4.93\t0.09\t-\nEthnicity:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8.15\t0.10\t-\nCaucasian\t10\t48\t3\t16\t13\t48\t\t\t\nAfro-Caribbean\t8\t38\t10\t52\t12\t44\t\t\t\nOthers (Asian/mixed)\t3\t14\t6\t31\t2\t8\t\t\t\nPsychiatric diagnosis:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPTSD\t12\t57\t13\t68\t-\t\t\t\t\nDepression\t6\t29\t6\t31\t-\t\t\t\t\nAnxiety disorders\t4\t19\t5\t26\t-\t\t\t\t\nSocial phobia\t1\t5\t1\t5\t-\t\t\t\t\nADHD\t1\t5\t1\t5\t\t\t\t\t\nODD/CD/Other disruptive behaviors\t4\t19\t3\t16\t\t\t\t\t\n### Caption\nDemographic Characteristic of 21 Young People Exposed to Childhood Abuse, 19 Psychiatric Controls and 27 Healthy Controls.\n### Footer\nCA = childhood abuse;

Here we have examined the correlation of intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity with two critical reading-related skills\u2014phonological awareness (PA) and rapid automatized naming (RAN)\u2014with fMRI technology. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that the cerebellum may contribute to reading either by phonological skills or by automatizing skills. We chose the left and right cerebellum VI as ROIs, and we calculated the intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity during a resting state. We further explored whether and how cerebro-cerebellar resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) is associated with individuals\u2019 reading-related skills including PA and RAN. The results showed that the functional connectivity between the left supramarginal gyrus and bilateral cerebellum VI was related to RAN, and the connectivity between the left insula and right cerebellum VI was related to PA. However, the effect of PA did not survive after the RAN was regressed out. Control analyses further confirmed that it was the intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity rather than the local cerebellar functionality that associated with phonological awareness ability and rapid automatized naming ability. For the first time, the relationship between cerebro-cerebellar resting state functional connectivity and specific reading-related skills has been explored, and this has deepened our understanding of the way the cerebellum VI is involved in reading. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIncreasing evidence has shown that the cerebellum is engaged in high-level cognitive processing, particularly, in reading ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ). For example, numerous studies have reported that the cerebellum was involved in a variety of reading tasks, including phonological processing, visual letter recognition, as well as semantic processing ( ;  ;  ;  ). Particularly, the bilateral cerebellum VI, a middle part of the cerebellum, plays a more essential role than other parts in reading. A voxel-based morphometry study found a significant negative correlation between the gray matter volume of the left cerebellum VI (lobule VI/Crus I) and reading accuracy in normal readers ( ). A meta-analysis also found that the right cerebellum VI was consistently activated during reading-related tasks ( ). Although these findings suggest a relationship between the bilateral cerebellum VI and reading, it remains unclear how the cerebellum VI contributes to reading. \n\nThe involvement of the cerebellum in high-level cognitive processing could be attributed to the structural and functional cerebro-cerebellar connection ( ). As a support,   observed that the cerebellum VI functionally connected with cerebral regions during reading, including the left fusiform gyrus, the left inferior frontal gyrus, and the left lateral temporal cortex.   further found that abnormality of cerebro-cerebellar connections was associated with reading impairment, suggesting that variation of cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity is associated with differences in reading ability. \n\nA previous study indicated that an intrinsic network organization underlying cognitive processes can be reflected by resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) ( ). For example, RSFC is associated with individual differences in several cognitive domains, including executive control, episodic memory, and learning ( ;  ;  ). Compared to functional connectivity during certain cognitive task, RSFC indicates intrinsic, task-independent features of brain function ( ;  ). Importantly, task-induced BOLD activity could be predicted by RSFC ( ;  ), and the reading network can also be investigated during the resting state ( ).   found that reading competence positively related to RSFC between the left precentral gyrus and other motor regions as well as between the pars opercularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus and the posterior part of the left superior temporal gyrus, suggesting that reading can be facilitated by stronger connectivity among motor regions and between language regions. Besides, it was proposed that RSFC was associated with Chinese reading abilities ( ;  ;  ). A recent study further observed that the strength of RSFC between the left thalamus and the right cerebellum, which are thought to be associated with attention, is positively correlated with phonological fluency ( ). However, up until now, no study has directly explored whether RSFC between the cerebellum and cerebrum is associated with reading. \n\nAs to the mechanism of how the cerebellum is engaged in reading, the cerebellar deficit hypothesis proposed that articulatory processing and automatizing processing were two key components that the cerebellum possibly contributes toward, the deficit of which can lead to subsequent problems when learning how to read ( ). Moreover, lack of articulatory fluency will finally lead to difficulties in phonological awareness ( ). Evidence to support this hypothesis comes from two aspects. Firstly, cerebellum was indeed engaged in phonological ( ;  ) and automatizing processing ( ;  ). Secondly, phonological skill and automatizing skill are closely related to reading. For example, phonological awareness (PA) and rapid automatized naming (RAN, a way to estimate automatizing skill) have been confirmed as significant predictors of reading performance across languages ( ;  ;  ). A meta-analysis further revealed that PA and RAN were correlated to reading accuracy and reading fluency, respectively ( ). These two skills have frequently been used to evaluate reading abilities ( ,  ) and distinguish between dyslexic and normal readers ( ). \n\nThe cerebellar deficit hypothesis also indicated that reading impairment can be caused by cerebellar deficits showing up before reading acquisition, and the cerebellum plays a vital role in the initial stage of reading ( ). A meta-analysis has reported both common and divergent reading-related activation in children and adults ( ), and a previous study also proposed that reading competence was related to different RSFC patterns in children and adults ( ).   demonstrated that better reading performance was associated with stronger functional coupling between the fusiform gyrus and phonology-related regions/default mode network in adults but not in children. The research to date has tended to focus on RSFC-reading relationships in adults ( ;  ;  ). However, far too little attention has been paid to the relationship between RSFC and reading in children ( ). Given reading skills are not yet fully matured during childhood, studies based on children can investigate the way the cerebellum affects reading in the developmental stages. \n\nThe current study has aimed to examine whether and how the intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity (RSFC) associates with the two important reading-related skills\u2014phonological and automatizing skills\u2014in children. For this purpose, we have analyzed the correlation between intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity with PA and RAN, both of which are important predictors of reading performance. Given the convergent evidence, which showed that the cerebellum VI was consistently involved in reading, we chose bilateral cerebellum VI as regions of interest (ROIs). We hypothesized that reading-related cognitive processes were supported by the cooperation of the cerebellum and cerebrum. Specifically, both PA and RAN scores were associated with the intrinsic functional connectivity between the cerebellum VI and cerebral areas. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nFifty-seven typically developing children without reading disorders [31 males and 26 females, mean age = 10.19 years, standard deviation (SD) = 0.96] took part in the experiment. All participants were native speakers of Mandarin and were recruited and screened from several primary schools in Beijing from grades three to six. They were all right-handed and had normal IQs (Raven Percentiles \u226550, Raven\u2019s Standard Progressive Matrices:  ) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. In addition, children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD,  ), neurological disease, or psychiatric disorders were excluded. All the 57 participants meet the criteria of head motion not exceeding 3 mm or 3\u00b0. This study was approved by the Institutional Reviews Board of the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning at Beijing Normal University, and written consent was obtained from the children and their parents. \n\n\n### Behavior Measures \n  \nRaven\u2019s Standard Progressive Matrices was applied to test the children\u2019s IQ. A Chinese phonological awareness test ( ,  ) and a rapid automatized naming test ( ) were then used to evaluate the children\u2019s phonological and automatizing skills. Details of the two tests are described below. \n\n#### Chinese Phonological Awareness (PA) Test \n  \nThe Chinese phonological awareness test consists of four subtests: phoneme deletion, tone detection, onset detection, and rime detection. In the phoneme deletion test, the participants were asked to pronounce a given word after deleting a phoneme, for example, \u201cshua3\u201d after removing \u201ca\u201d should be pronounced as \u201cshu3.\u201d In the tone/onset/rime deletion test, the participants were asked to find the one word, out of four words, that differed (by the tone, onset, or rime level). For example, when it comes to the tone level, such as [ba4, san4, bei4, bo1], the different one is bo1; for the onset detection, [ba3, san1, bei4, bo1], the correct answer is san1; and for the rime detection, [ban3, san1, ban4, bo1], bo1 was the different one. The number of correct answers was recorded as a raw score. Raw scores were firstly converted into   Z   scores in each grade and then into standard scores with a mean of 100 and SD of 15. Averaged   Z   scores of the four tests indicated the phonological processing ability. The higher the score, the better the phonological awareness. \n\n\n#### The Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) Test \n  \nThe rapid automatized naming test was used to measure automatization ability ( ). When performing this task, participants were required to read out visually-presented Arabic numbers as quickly and accurately as possible. The participants did the test twice, and the total time to read all digits was recorded each time. The average time was calculated and translated into   Z   scores in each grade. The   Z   scores were then multiplied by \u22121, and they were then converted into standard scores with a mean of 100 and SD of 15; higher scores represented better performances. \n\n\n\n### Imaging Procedure and Acquisition \n  \nResting-state images were acquired with a 3T Siemens scanner at Beijing Normal University. Before the formal experiment, the participants participated in 20 min of training in a mock scanner in order to familiarize themselves with the environment and the requirements. The resting-state MRI scanning session lasted for 8 min. The participants were informed to close their eyes, keep their head and body still, and to think of nothing to avoid inner language disturbances. A T2-weighted gradient-echo EPI sequence was used to acquire functional images, and the acquisition parameters were TR = 2400 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 81\u00b0, FOV = 192 \u00d7 192 mm, slice number = 40 slices, slice thickness = 3 mm, and voxel size = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm. We used Sequential scanning. For better image registration, we also collected T1-weighted images, TR = 2300 ms, TE = 4.18 ms, flip angle = 9\u00b0, FOV = 256 \u00d7 256 mm, slice number = 176 slices, slice thickness = 1 mm, and voxel size = 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm. \n\n\n### Data Analysis \n  \n#### Preprocessing \n  \nFunctional MRI scans were preprocessed with DPABI software  ( ). The resting state functional image preprocessing included several steps: (1) the first 10 time points were deleted; (2) the slice-timing was corrected with the middle slice as the reference slice and realignment; (3) all functional images were co-registered to the corresponding anatomical image; (4) functional images were normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space; (5) the spatial was smoothed with 4 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel; (6) linear trends were removed, and band-pass temporal filtering (0.01\u20130.08 Hz) was applied. In addition, we regressed out six motion parameters, the white matter signal, and the cerebrospinal fluid signal to reduce motion and physiological signal interference. \n\n\n#### Cerebellum ROI \n  \nCoordinates of the bilateral cerebellum VI were chosen based on a previous meta-analysis ( ). The sphere of the left cerebellum VI was centered at MNI coordinate (\u221222, \u221268, \u221220) and the right cerebellum VI was centered at MNI coordinate (24, \u221266, \u221224,  ). For each ROI, a sphere was created with a radius of 6 mm. \n  \nThe location of ROIs.   (A)   The coordinate of the left cerebellum VI is [\u201322, \u201368, \u201320] and the right cerebellum VI is [24, \u201366, \u201324].   (B)   The location of control ROI. The right cerebellum V [6, \u201364, \u201310], a motion-related region, is used for a control analysis. \n  \nIn addition, we chose the cerebellum V (MNI coordinate [6, \u221264, \u221210],  ;  ), related to motor function, as another ROI to use to perform a control analysis (for detailed information, see section \u201cControl analyses\u201d). For the display, the cerebellum ROIs were overlaid onto the suit template  with the software MRIcron . \n\n\n#### Correlation of Cerebro-Cerebellar RSFC and Reading-Related Skills \n  \nWe firstly extracted and averaged the BOLD signal of all voxels within each ROI (i.e., left or right cerebellum VI) used as the seed region for functional connectivity analysis. The time-series correlation of average BOLD signal between each seed region and each voxel in the bilateral cerebrum was calculated with SPM12 . The correlation coefficients were transformed into Fisher\u2019s   Z   scores as an index for cerebro-cerebellar RSFC. Finally, we calculated the correlation between   Z   scores and the phonological or rapid naming test performances in each seed region. \n\nAll the correlation maps were corrected for multiple comparisons by Gaussian random field (GRF) correction (voxel-level   p   < 0.001 and cluster-level   p   < 0.05, two-tailed) with DPABI software (see text Footnote 1;  ). GRF corrections were widely used to control the family-wise error rate (FWER) of testing multiple hypothesis in neuroimaging.   confirmed that the FWER can reach the nominal 5% level if the threshold was set voxel-wise   p   < 0.0005 and cluster-wise   p   < 0.025 to perform two one-tailed tests, which is equivalent to the threshold in our study (voxel-level   p   < 0.001 and cluster-level   p   < 0.05, two-tailed). This multiple comparison correction method was recommended when considering the FWER ( ). In addition, the peak voxel in each cluster was reported based on the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) template ( ). All threshold brain images were overlaid onto the Brainmesh_ICBM152_smoothed.nv surf template with the software BrainNet Viewer ( )  for display. \n\nIn our study, we were primarily concerned with how the cerebro-cerebellar RSFC associates with phonological skills and automatizing skills, as indicated by the measures of PA and RAN. We then first calculated the correlation between the cerebro-cerebellar RSFC with each skill separately. Given that there is potential correlation between Raven\u2019s IQ, PA, and RAN, we additionally performed a partial correlation analysis. For details, when we calculated the correlation between cerebro-cerebellar RSFC and RAN, either the Raven\u2019s IQ, the scores of PA, or both were used as the covariate(s). When we calculated the correlation between cerebro-cerebellar RSFC and PA, the Raven\u2019s IQ, the scores of RAN, or both were used as the covariate(s). \n\n\n#### Control Analyses \n  \nWe further performed two control analyses to exclude potential confounds or other possibilities. Firstly, given the RSFC might be confounded by the local functionalities of the cerebellum, we calculated the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF), a representative index of local brain functionalities in the resting state fMRI ( ), and explored whether the ALFF of bilateral cerebellum VI correlated to the two reading-related skills. The amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) measures the spontaneous activity of the specific brain area in order to reflect the local functionality property. We followed the calculation procedure used in previous studies ( ). Fast Fourier transform (FFT) was used to transform the time series to frequency domain. After calculating the power spectrum, it was square rooted, and the square root across 0.01\u20130.08 Hz was then averaged at each voxel, and this was taken as the ALFF. The ALFF of each voxel was divided by the mean ALFF value for standardization. At last, the averaged ALFF of each ROI was extracted for further correlation analysis. The significance of correlation was estimated by Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. \n\nSecondly, we tested whether the cerebellum V, a region related to motor function, also showed correlation between intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar RSFC and PA/RAN. During this analysis, we extracted the averaged BOLD signal of cerebral regions whose RSFC with the bilateral cerebellum VI correlated with PA or RAN. Then we calculated the RSFC between the cerebellum V and these cerebral regions to explore whether this intrinsic RSFC was associated with the two reading-related skills. This analysis aimed to answer whether the association between intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar RSFC and reading-related skills is just a feature of the cerebellum VI or could be generalized to other cerebellum regions, such as the cerebellum V. In this analysis, we replaced the cerebellum VI with cerebellum V. The significance of correlation was also estimated by Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavior Results \n  \n shows the demographic information and the results of reading-related tests. The scores of both the phonological awareness test and the rapid automatized naming test followed the normal distribution. The correlation between the scores of PA and RAN was significant (  r   = 0.41,   p   = 0.002) with the Bonferroni correction. The correlation was marginally significant between Raven\u2019s IQ and PA (  r   = 0.232,   p   = 0.082) and not significant between Raven\u2019s IQ and RAN (  r   = 0.220,   p   = 0.101). \n  \nCharacteristics of participants. \n    \n\n### Correlation of Cerebro-Cerebellar RSFC and Reading-Related Skills \n  \nWhen the left cerebellum VI was used as a seed region, the RSFC of this ROI and the left supramarginal gyrus (extended to the postcentral gyrus) was significantly correlated with RAN scores (cluster-level GRF corrected   p   < 0.05, voxel-level   p   < 0.001; cluster size = 91,   and  ), which revealed that better RAN performance related to stronger functional connectivity. No significant correlation was observed between the PA scores and the RSFC (cluster-level GRF corrected   p   < 0.05, voxel-level   p   < 0.001). \n  \nThe correlation between the cerebro-cerebellar resting-state functional connectivity and PA/RAN. \n      \nSignificant correlation between cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity and PA/RAN.   (A)   Functional connectivity between left cerebellum VI and left SMG was positively correlated with RAN.   (B)   Functional connectivity between right cerebellum VI and left INS was positively correlated with PA.   (C)   Functional connectivity between right cerebellum VI and left SMG was positively correlated with RAN under a loose threshold. L.SMG, the left supramarginal gyrus; L.INS, the left insula; RAN, rapid automatized naming; PA, phonological awareness. \n  \nWhen the right cerebellum VI was used as a seed, the RSFC between the ROI and the left insula (extended to the superior temporal gyrus) was found to be correlated with PA (cluster-level GRF corrected   p   < 0.05, voxel-level   p   < 0.001, cluster size = 80,   and  ), suggesting that better PA performance also related to stronger functional connectivity. No significant correlation between RAN scores and RSFC was observed at this stringent threshold. However, we did observe a tendency for the RSFC between the ROI and the left supramarginal gyrus (extended to the postcentral gyrus) to correlate with RAN, which could survive with a loose threshold (voxel-level   p   < 0.001, uncorrected, cluster size = 62,   and  ). \n\nIn order to exclude the potential effect of IQ on the results, we re-did the above brain and behavior correlation analyses with Raven\u2019s IQ as the covariate. When Raven\u2019s IQ was regressed out, the performance on RAN still correlated with the RSFC between the left cerebellum VI and left postcentral gyrus (extended to the supramarginal gyrus) and between the right cerebellum VI and left supramarginal gyrus (extended to the postcentral gyrus), using the corrected threshold as in the above analysis. But we can only observe the correlation of PA and RSFC between the right cerebellum VI and the left insular at a looser threshold (voxel-level   p   < 0.001, uncorrected,   and  ). \n\nFurthermore, when PA was regressed out, the performance on RAN was correlated with the RSFC between the left cerebellum VI and left supramarginal gyrus (extended to the postcentral gyrus) and between the right cerebellum VI and left supramarginal gyrus (extended to the postcentral gyrus) at the threshold of voxel-level   p   < 0.001, uncorrected. When RAN was used as a covariate, the correlation between PA and RSFC of the right cerebellum VI with the left insula did not survive, even with an uncorrected threshold (voxel-level threshold   p   < 0.001, uncorrected,   and  ). \n\nFinally, when PA and Raven\u2019s IQ were regressed out, the correlation of RAN and the RSFC between the left cerebellum VI and left supramarginal gyrus (extended to the postcentral gyrus) and between the right cerebellum VI and left supramarginal gyrus (extended to the postcentral gyrus) could be observed with an uncorrected threshold (voxel-level   p   < 0.001, uncorrected). When RAN and Raven\u2019s IQ were regressed out, the correlation between PA and RSFC did not survive even with an uncorrected threshold (voxel-level threshold   p   < 0.001, uncorrected;   and  ). \n\nBased on the above results, it is likely that the RSFC of the cerebellum VI does not directly contribute to PA. Instead, RSFC might be affected by PA via RAN. We then further conducted a mediation analysis to test this possibility. However, we did not observe a significant mediation effect of RAN for the cerebellum VI functional connectivity. Detailed information is displayed in the  . \n\n\n### Control Analyses \n  \nFor ALFF, no significant correlation was found between either the left or right cerebellum VI and reading-related skills in our study (  p  s > 0.2). Detailed correlation coefficients (  r  ) and   p   values are presented in  . \n  \n (A)   The correlations between ALFF intensity in the cerebellum and reading-related skills.   (B)   The correlations between cerebellum V\u2013cerebrum RSFC and the reading-related skills. L.SMG, the left supramarginal gyrus; L.INS, the left insula; RAN, rapid automatized naming; PA, phonological awareness; RSFC, resting state functional connectivity. The   p   value in the picture is the uncorrected   p   value. \n  \nAdditionally, the RSFCs of cerebellum V (MNI coordinate [6, \u221264, \u221210]) and cerebral regions, including the supramarginal gyrus (MNI coordinate [\u221263, \u221221, 27] and [\u221257, \u221218, 24]) and the left insular (MNI coordinate [\u221257, \u22123, 3]), were not significantly correlated with either reading-related skills (  p  s > 0.1,  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the current study, we have aimed to investigate the way in which the cerebellum VI contributes to reading. More specifically, we tested whether the cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity during a resting state (RSFC) was associated with two essential reading-related skills: phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming. To this end, we chose the left and right cerebellum VI as ROIs based on a meta-analysis, and we calculated the correlation of cerebro-cerebellar RSFC and phonological awareness or rapid automatized naming. Our study showed that the connectivity between the left supramarginal gyrus and bilateral cerebellum VI was related to rapid automatized naming, and the connectivity between the left insula and right cerebellum VI was related to phonological awareness. But the latter effect did not survive after the rapid automatized naming was regressed out. The control analyses further showed there is no significant correlation between the local functionality of the cerebellum VI (indicated with ALFF) and both reading-related skills, confirming the association between the intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity and reading-related skills cannot be interpreted by the local functionality of the cerebellum VI. The control analyses also showed that reading-related skills were not correlated with the RSFC between the cerebellum V and cerebral regions, illustrating how the observed intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar RSFC and reading-related skills were just features of the cerebellum VI. For the first time, we tested the hypothesis that the cerebellum contributes to reading, either by phonological skills or by automatizing skills through RSFC, which provided new findings as to how the cerebellum VI contributes to reading. \n\nIt is worth noting that reading is a complex process, including not only the more basic levels of linguistic functions (phonological processing and lexical access) involved in reading but also the levels of conceptualization and situation model building ( ). Our study only focused on the former level. Previous studies frequently found the cerebellum VI is involved in reading ( ;  ;  ;  ). More specifically, the association between the cerebellum and rapid automatized naming has been reported in previous studies ( ), and the abnormity in the cerebellar-frontal circuit was found to be related to rapid automatized naming ( ). Rapid automatized naming was also associated with Chinese reading accuracy and fluency ( ,  ). Moreover,   has shown that RAN and reading rely on similar brain regions. Here we have illustrated that the cerebellum VI is involvd in reading through cerebro-cerebellar connections. Specifically, we found a positive relationship between cerebro-cerebellar RSFC and individuals\u2019 performance in RAN. Our findings have provided the first evidence that the intrinsic connectivity during a resting state could be a predictive index for rapid automatized naming skills. \n\nThe results of a partial correlation analysis were similar to that of the main analysis when Raven\u2019s IQ was used as a covariate, suggesting such correlations were not affected by Raven\u2019s IQ. We found that the correlation between the left cerebellum VI-left supramarginal gyrus RSFC and PA can survive when PA was regressed out at the threshold voxel-level (  p   < 0.001 uncorrected). Importantly, when PA was regressed out, we also found RAN correlated with RSFC between the right cerebellum VI and left supramarginal gyrus (voxel-level   p   < 0.001, uncorrected), although such an effect was unable to survive after a GRF multiple comparison correction in the main analysis. These findings suggest that there is a relationship between the bilateral cerebellum VI and the RAN. Importantly, when both the RAN and Raven\u2019s IQ were regressed out, we did not observe PA correlated with RSFC between the right cerebellum VI and left insula, even at an uncorrected threshold (voxel-level   p   < 0.001). As proposed by the double-deficit hypothesis, PA and RAN would play a relatively independent role in reading ( ). Our findings did not support that the cerebellum VI was equally associated with PA and RAN. After all, the correlation between RSFC of the cerebellum and PA would not survive if RAN was used as a covariate, and we also did not observe if the RSFC of the cerebellum VI can be affected by PA via RAN. However, the possibility cannot be excluded that there might be some common components between these two abilities, which are associated with both articulation and automatization. \n\nThe examination of RAN and PA provide insights into the understanding of the cerebellar deficit hypothesis of dyslexia, which has proposed that cerebellar deficit could cause both phonological and automatization deficits at the cognitive level ( ). Functional imaging studies have investigated the double-deficit hypothesis of developmental dyslexia by using the phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming ( ), which found that children with only phonological awareness deficits showed less activation in the left inferior frontal and inferior parietal regions compared to typically developing readers, and children with only a rapid naming deficit showed less activation in the cerebellum compared to typically developing readers. The current study further showed that the RAN\u2013reading relationship may manifest through the RSFC between the cerebellum and cerebral regions, which is consistent with the established role of the speedy processing of the cerebellum. Actually, it has been frequently proposed that the relationship between RAN and reading should be observed ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nNotably, although PA and RAN are predictors of reading abilities, they are also associated with other cognitive functions, such as attention, working memory, and mathematics ( ;  ;  ;  ).   observed the predictive relation between PA and executive attention in Chinese-English bilingual children, thus suggesting the relationship between PA and executive function. Moreover, RAN was considered to mediate the relationship between attention and reading fluency ( ), suggesting that the attention ability may be associated with RAN. Other researchers have also proposed that the relationship between RAN and reading is due to executive functions, such as working memory and inhibition ( ). Accordingly, it is unclear whether our correlated functional connectivity via PA/RAN could be specifically dedicated to reading alone. \n\nIn addition, we obtained the findings by studying Chinese children learning to read Mandarin. An interesting issue is whether the correlation between the cerebro-cerebellar RSFC and RAN could be generalized to alphabetic language. We have speculated that the answer is yes. RSFC exhibited significant positive correlations with reading abilities for Chinese children ( ;  ;  ). As for alphabetic language,   also observed that reading competence in children correlated positively with RSFC between the left precentral gyrus and other motor regions as well as between Broca\u2019s and Wernicke\u2019s areas. Even though these studies did not directly examine the relationship between the RSFC of the cerebellum and reading competence, it has been reported that the cerebellum also played an essential role in phonological processing for alphabetic language ( ;  ). \n\nFinally, our findings have provided new evidence for the functional segregation of the cerebellum. Recent studies have shown that the anterior part of the cerebellum is responsible for movement and other low-level processing, while the posterior part of the cerebellum is mainly responsible for high-level cognitive functions, including language, memory, emotion, and so on ( ), which suggests that there is a functional segregation of cerebellum. Here we found that the cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity of the cerebellum VI but not cerebellum V correlated with certain reading-related skill(s), thus confirming the functional differentiation between the cerebellum VI and V. Future studies may be required to comprehensively examine how cerebellum is functionally segregated, and how the different subregions cooperate with cerebrum in reading or other high-level cognitive processing through cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity. \n\nThere are some limitations in our study. Firstly, we performed resting-state functional connectivity rather than task-based, which may not be able to reliably generalize the findings based on RSFC to encompass task-related neural activity; we should be cautious when assessing the relationship between RSFC and reading-related skills ( ). Future studies are required to examine the association between task-related cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity and these reading-related skills. Secondly, a recent meta-analysis has shown that the reliability of RSFC is rather mediocre ( ), and our results need to be further validated by carrying out more research in the future. In addition, we only looked at RAN and PA without other reading-relevant cognitive factors, and these two tests were associated with other cognitive functions besides reading. The association of the connectivity between brain regions and the cognitive task has to be interpreted cautiously, as other factors may influence this association. Finally, our study is cross-sectional with a specific population of Chinese children learning to read Mandarin, a language substantially different form the western languages; whether the results can be generalized to encompass an alphabetic language requires further investigation. \n\nIn conclusion, we found that the intrinsic functional connectivity between bilateral cerebellum VI and the left supramarginal gyrus was associated with RAN, and this correlation was not affected by the phonological awareness ability. These findings suggested that the relationship between the cerebellum and reading may have been related to the automatizing skill. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Institutional Reviews Board of the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning at Beijing Normal University.

We divided 65 Parkinson's disease patients into anxiety (PD-A;   n  =18) and non-anxiety (PD-NA;   n  =45) groups based on a Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale cutoff score of 12. The PD-A patients exhibited altered putamen FC with cortical and subcortical regions. The PD-A patients showed enhanced putamen FC with the caudatum, which correlated with increased emotional processing during anxiety. Decreased putamen FC with the orbitofrontal gyrus and cerebellum also correlated with increased anxiety in Parkinson's disease. Our findings demonstrate that anxiety disorder in Parkinson's disease is associated with abnormal putamen FC networks, especially with caudatum, orbitofrontal gyrus and cerebellum. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nAnxiety syndrome is more prevalent in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients (6%-55%) [ ] than in the general population and non-PD patients [ ,  ]. Furthermore, anxiety in PD is associated with increased motor symptoms and negatively impacts quality of life [ ]. Anxiety is clinically under-diagnosed in PD patients and is neglected while researching PD pathology. \n\nIn recent years, neuroimaging technology has been widely used to investigate functional and structural alterations of motor and non-motor symptoms in PD brains [ ,  ]. Positron emission computed tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and T1 structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used to image individual brain regions while investigating anxiety disorders in PD [ ]. Most PET/SPECT reports show correlation between putamen and severity of anxiety [ \u2013 ]. However, the association between anxiety in PD and alterations in putamen FCfunctional connectivity (FC) with other brain regions is unknown. \n\nResting state-functional MRI (rs-fMRI) measures the resting blood oxygen level-dependent signal to determine spontaneous brain activity between functionally linked brain regions at the level of neural networks. FC indicates inter-regional temporal patterns of the blood oxygen level-dependent signal [ ]. Recently, rs-fMRI has been extensively used to explore neurological and psychiatric diseases [ ,  ], including various motor [ ]and non-motor symptoms [ \u2013 ] in PD. \n\nThe aim of this study was to use rs-fMRI to analyze differences in the putamen FC patterns among 3 study subject groups:, namely, PD patients with anxiety (PD-A), PD patients without anxiety (PD-NA) and healthy controls. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Study subjects \n  \nSixty-five right-handed PD patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic of our hospital and diagnosed with idiopathic PD according to the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria [ ]. The following patients were excluded from the study: (1) patients with corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, vascular parkinsonism, and other forms of parkinsonism; (2) patients with contraindications to MRI such as claustrophobia, metallic implants or devices in the body; (3) patients with severe cognitive decline indicated by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score < 24; (4) patients with clinically prominent depressive symptoms (17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, HAMD score > 14) for controlling possible hybrid factors. None of the patients took anti-psychotic drugs. MRI scans and clinical examinations were performed at least 12 h after withdrawal from medications to mitigate the pharmacological effects on neural activity. Meanwhile, 24 healthy controls without psychological and neurological disturbances or neuroimaging abnormalities were recruited for this study. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by the ethics committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. \n\n\n### Clinical assessment of study subjects \n  \nPD patients were classified into PD-A (  n   = 18) and PD-NA (  n   = 45) groups based on the cut off score of 12 on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) score [ \u2013 ]. The HAMA scale is a fourteen-item scale (total scores ranging 0-56) that measures both psychic and somatic anxiety symptoms [ ], which is useful in evaluating anxiety severity in clinical practice and research [ ]. Anxiety disorders of PD patients were assessed by a trained movement disorder specialist (Kezhong Zhang), sensitized to psychiatric disorders in PD. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) and Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) staging scales were used to assess PD motor severity and disease stage, respectively. Total levodopa-equivalent daily dose (LEDD), LEDD of levodopa preparations and LEDD of dopamine receptor agonists of each PD patient were calculated as previously described [ ]. Disease duration of PD patients and education levels of all subjects were recorded. Cognitive function, executive function and symptoms of depression were also quantified separately by MMSE, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and HAMD. \n\n\n### Rs-fMRI methodology \n  \nMRI scanning were performed with a 3.0 T Siemens MAGNETOM Verio whole-body MRI system (Siemens Medical Solutions, Germany) equipped with eight-channel, phase-array head coils. Tight foam padding was used to minimize head movement and ear-plugs were used to reduce noise. Subjects were instructed to remain motionless, close their eyes, remain awake, and not to think about anything in particular. T1-weighted 3D high resolution anatomical images were acquired using the following volumetric 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence: repetition time (TR) = 1900 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.95 ms, flip angle (FA) = 9\u00b0, slice thickness = 1 mm, slices = 160, field of view (FOV) = 230 \u00d7 230 mm , matrix size = 256 \u00d7 256 and voxel size = 1 \u00d7 1\u00d7 1 mm . Resting-state functional images were collected using the following echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 21 ms, FA = 90\u00b0, FOV = 256 \u00d7 256 mm , in-plane matrix = 64 \u00d7 64, slices = 35, slice thickness = 3 mm, no slice gap, voxel size = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm , total 4 volumes = 240. \n\n\n### Rs-fMRI data analysis \n  \nThe rs-fMRI data was analyzed by the data processing assistant for resting-state fMRI (DPARSF,  ) [ ] with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8,  ). The analysis included 1) removal of the first 10 time points; 2) slice timing correction; 3) head motion correction   via   six-parameter rigid body spatial transformation during data acquisition; 4) nonlinear registration of the high-resolution T1 structural images to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template and segmenting them into white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid using the DARTEL (diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra) algorithm [ ] followed by further structural analyses of the resulting segments; 5) nuisance signal removal (white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, global signal, 6-head motion parameters as covariates)   via   multiple regression; 6) spatial normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute template; 7) resampling images into a spatial resolution of 3\u00d73\u00d73 mm ; 8) spatial smoothening with a Gaussian kernel (full width at half-maximum = 4\u00d74\u00d74 mm ); 9) temporal bandpass filtering (0.01 < f < 0.08 Hz) and linear detrended removal. We excluded subjects from further analysis if the translation or rotation of head movement was > 2 mm or 2\u00b0 in any direction. Additionally, the mean head translation, mean head rotation, and frame-wise displacement were calculated [ ]. There were no differences in head motion parameters among the three groups (  p   > 0.05). \n\n\n### Functional connectivity analysis \n  \nThe left and right putamen were defined as two regions of interest (ROI) based on the Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) template by selecting specific areas to study anxiety-dependent resting-state functional networks in PD patients. A voxel-wise FC analysis was performed by computing the temporal correlation between the mean time series of each ROI and the time series of each voxel within the brain. Pearson's correlation coefficient maps were created for each individual subject and were converted to a z-value using Fisher's z transformation. \n\nAnalysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to identify brain areas with differences between the three study subject groups with age, gender, education, HAMD scores and gray matter volume as covariates (voxel-level   p   < 0.05; cluster size > 113 voxels; corrected   p   < 0.01 as determined by AlphaSim correction). These areas were then extracted as a mask. Then, two-sample post hoc t tests were performed within this mask, with age, gender, education, HAMD scores and gray matter volume as covariates, to detect differences between study subject groups (voxel-level   p   < 0.05; cluster size of the left putamen > 13 voxels; cluster size of the right putamen > 16 voxels; corrected   p   < 0.01 as determined by AlphaSim correction). Additionally, for each ROI, the clusters that showed differences in FC between PD-A and PD-NA groups were extracted separately. Then the average FC value of each cluster was calculated to estimate the correlation of anxiety severity. The Pearson correlation between mean FC values and HAMA scores was calculated by IBM SPSS statistics v20.0.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and the significance was set at   p   < 0.01 (two-tailed;  ). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe clinical data was analyzed with the IBM SPSS statistics v20.0.0 software and expressed as mean \u00b1 s.d. The continuous and categorical variables were analyzed by either one-way analysis of variance test, chi-square test, independent-sample   t  -test or nonparametric tests.   p   < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Demographic and clinical characteristics \n  \nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of PD-A, PD-NA and healthy control subjects are summarized in Table  . The three subject groups showed differences in age, gender, HAMD scores, but education levels were similar. The PD-A and PD-NA subjects had similar disease duration, H&Y staging, total LEDD, LEDD of levodopa preparations and LEDD of dopamine receptor agonists and UPDRSIII scores (  p   > 0.01). The MMSE and FAB scores for PD-A and PD-NA subjects was also similar. As expected, the HAMA scores were different between the three groups (  p   < 0.01). \n   Demographic and clinical characteristics of all subjects    \nData are presented as mean \u00b1 s.d.. \n\nAbbreviations: PD-A, Parkinson's disease with anxiety; PD-NA, Parkinson's disease without anxiety; HC, Healthy controls; NA, Not applicable; M, Male; F, Female; y, year; H&Y, Hoehn and Yahr; LEDD, Levodopa equivalent daily dose; DA, Dopamine receptor agonists; LP, Levodopa preparations; UPDRS, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale; MMSE, Mini Mental State Examination; FAB, Frontal Assessment Battery; HAMD, 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; HAMA, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. \n\n P   < 0.05 was considered significant.  chi-square test;  one-way analysis of variance test (ANOVA);  two-sample t-test. \n  \n\n### Functional connectivity data \n  \nThere were differences in the left putamen FC with right orbitofrontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, right postcentral cortex and left anterior cingulate among all three study groups, namely, PD-A, PD-NA and healthy controls. Similarly, all three study groups showed differences in right putamen FC with the left orbitofrontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, bilateral paracentral lobule, right precuneus, left temporal pole, left middle occipital gyrus, right cerebellum, right insula, bilateral middle cingulate gyrus and left caudatum. \n\nNext, two-sample post hoc   t  -tests were performed to detect pair-wise differences in FC of the putamen regions among the PD-A, PD-NA and healthy control groups. The PD-A group showed following differences with PD-NA group: (1) reduced left putamen FC with right orbitofrontal gyrus; (2) reduced right putamen FC with left orbitofrontal gyrus, right cerebellum and right precuneus; (3) increased right putamen FC with right insula, left temporal pole, left middle occipital gyrus, left caudatum and right middle cingulate gyrus (Table   and Figure  ). \n   Pair-wise differences in the putamen FC    \nPost hoc two sample t-tests with age, gender, education, HAMD scores and grey matter volume as covariates were performed to test differences between groups on the putamen FC.

Rs-fMRI analysis revealed significant alterations in FC in the PD-A patients compared to the PD-NA and HC groups. The PD-A patients showed decreased left putamen FC with right orbitofrontal gyrus and right putamen FC with left orbitofrontal gyrus, right cerebellum and right precuneus. On the other hand, there was increased right putamen FC with right insula, left temporal pole, left middle occipital gyrus, left caudatum and right middle cingulate gyrus compared to PD patients without anxiety. This suggested abnormal putamen FC in the cortical and subcortical regions in PD-A patients. \n\nThe HAMA scores showed positive correlation between right putamen FC and left caudatum, but negative correlation for left putamen FC with right orbitofrontal gyrus and right putamen FC with left orbitofrontal gyrus and right cerebellum. These results demonstrate that anxiety in PD patients correlates with the aberrant putamen FC in them, especially with the caudatum, orbitofrontal gyrus and cerebellum. \n\nNeuroimaging studies with  I-FP-CIT SPECT, SPECT with TRODAT-1 or PET have explored anxiety severity in PD patients by assessing dopamine transporter (DAT) availability or density [ \u2013 ,  ,  ]. Most studies observed an inverse correlation between DAT availability in the putamen with the severity of anxiety in PD [ ,  ,  ]. However, Ceravolo   et al  . showed that increased striatal DAT density was associated with mild anxiety symptoms in PD patients [ ]. The PD rat model depleted of striatal dopamine showed increased anxiety [ ,  ], which improved upon L-DOPA treatment [ ,  ]. Furthermore, social anxiety disorder, which is common in PD patients was associated with dopaminergic-mediated striatal circuits [ ] and sustained suppression of DA receptor activity [ ]. These findings suggest a relationship between anxiety and dopaminergic dysfunction in PD patients. Therefore, we focused on interactions of the bilateral putamen with other brain areas in the present study. \n\nOur results show increased putamen FC with caudate in PD-A relative to PD-NA patients. Although striatal dysfunction is typically related to motor impairment in PD [ ], it is implicated in emotional processing [ ], thereby suggesting a common pathophysiological mechanism. Neuroimaging by [ F] fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) showed that anxiety symptoms in PD were inversely associated with DAT availability in the caudatum or decreased caudate metabolism [ ]. Therefore, enhanced putamen FC and caudatum suggested emotional processing during anxiety in PD patients. \n\nWe also observed reduced bilateral putamen FC with orbitofrontal gyrus in PD-A compared to PD-NA patients. Previous studies in non-PD patients demonstrated that orbitofrontal gyrus as the site for emotion processing. Milad   et al.   showed the role of medial orbitofrontal gyrus in conditioned fear response based on various animal studies and human neuroimaging analysis [ ]. Patients with agoraphobia, which is a panic disorder showed decreased gray matter volume in their left medial orbitofrontal gyrus compared to healthy controls [ ]. Moreover, patients with impaired orbitofrontal gyrus showed mental disturbances such as impulsive, socially inappropriate behavior and emotional changes compared to control subjects [ ]. This suggested the role of impaired orbitofrontal gyrus in anxiety disorders. Additionally, a T1-weighted MRI study in patients with early PD showed that focal orbitofrontal gyrus atrophy led to anxiety disorder [ ]. Topographically, orbitofrontal gyrus projects into regions of the striatum [ ] and the frontostriatal pathway has been implicated in anxiety [ ]. Based on these considerations, attenuated connections between orbitofrontal gyrus and putamen suggest abnormal frontostriatal pathway, which contributes to anxiety disorder in PD. \n\nThere was also reduced FC between cerebellum and putamen in PD-A relative to PD-NA subjects, thereby negatively correlating with anxiety severity. Clinical, experimental and neuroimaging studies indicate that the cerebellum is involved in neural processes beyond the motor domain [ ,  ]. For example, electrical stimulation of the human cerebellum produces anxiety and fear [ ]. The synaptic connections between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells of cerebellum are involved in the learned fear and their long-term potentiation contributes to fear memory [ ]. In functional brain imaging studies with PET, increased blood flow was observed in the left cerebellar hemisphere during fear conditioning [ ]. Therefore, both human and animal studies have shown that cerebellum contributes to fear-associated learning. Recently, a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies on functional topography in the human cerebellum showed involvement of the cerebellar posterior lobe in cognitive/emotional function [ ]. This is in agreement with our findings of decreased cerebellum FC, especially in the posterior lobe. Consequently, decreased communication between cerebellum and putamen plays a role in anxiety disorders observed in PD patients. \n\nThis study has several limitations. Firstly, our sample size was relatively small and therefore may not have detected exact neural substrates of PD-related anxiety disorder. Secondly, anxiety and depression overlap in PD patients with similar symptoms and pathophysiology [ ,  ]. Hence, patients with clinically distinct depressive symptoms were excluded from our study. However, HAMD scores still showed significant differences between study subject groups and therefore, FC was analyzed. Besides, age and gender were significantly different among groups. Many studies have shown correlation between PD-related anxiety disorder with age and gender [ ,  ]. Therefore, these were analyzed as covariates. Finally, although the present study defined important regions of interest that are responsible for anxiety in PD, it did not represent complete FC analysis. Therefore, further comprehensive studies are needed to identify other anxiety related networks that were not analyzed by our study. \n\nIn conclusion, our study showed that anxiety in PD was associated with altered FC network between putamen and other regions of the brain, especially caudatum, orbitofrontal gyrus and cerebellum. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nGroups\tPD-A(n=18)\tPD-NA(n=45)\tHC(n=24)\tP value\nGender (M/F)\t12, 6\t34, 11\t10,14\t0.02a\nAge (y)\t71.74\u00b15.16\t66.17\u00b18.11\t65.33\u00b14.65\t0.01b\nEducation (y)\t12.84\u00b12.95\t11.52\u00b13.56\t10.79\u00b12.92\t0.13b\nDisease duration (y)\t3.76\u00b13.23\t3.94\u00b12.87\t\t0.83c\nH&Y staging\t2.45\u00b10.60\t2.11\u00b10.71\t\t0.14c\nUPDRS-III\t24.05\u00b18.92\t21.52\u00b110.59\t\t0.36c\nTotal LEDD (mg/d)\t450.17\u00b1252.08\t373.95\u00b1306.93\t\t0.34c\nLEDD of DA (mg/d)\t33.55\u00b143.91\t40.90\u00b140.95\t\t0.52c\nLEDD of LP (mg/d)\t346.05\u00b1156.85\t257.32\u00b1223.62\t\t0.13c\nMMSE\t27.79\u00b11.87\t28.24\u00b11.57\t\t0.32c\nFAB\t27.79\u00b11.87\t28.24\u00b11.57\t\t0.32c\nHAMD\t9.26\u00b12.64\t3.83\u00b13.19\t1.54\u00b12.06\t<0.001b\nHAMA\t15.47\u00b13.01\t5.93\u00b13.42\t2.33\u00b12.04\t<0.001b\n### Caption\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of all subjects\n### Footer\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 s.d..Abbreviations: PD-A, Parkinson's disease with anxiety; PD-NA, Parkinson's disease without anxiety; HC, Healthy controls; NA, Not applicable; M, Male; F, Female; y, year; H&Y, Hoehn and Yahr; LEDD, Levodopa equivalent daily dose; DA, Dopamine receptor agonists; LP, Levodopa preparations; UPDRS, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale; MMSE, Mini Mental State Examination; FAB, Frontal Assessment Battery; HAMD, 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; HAMA, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale.P < 0.05 was considered significant. achi-square test; bone-way analysis of variance test (ANOVA); ctwo-sample t-test.\n\n\n## ID: T2\n### Label: Table 2\nBrain regions\tSide\tCluster size (mm3)\tCoordinates MINI\tCoordinates MINI\tCoordinates MINI\tZ value\nBrain regions\tUnnamed: 1_level_1\tUnnamed: 2_level_1\tX\tY\tZ\tUnnamed: 6_level_1\nPD-A > PD-NA\t\t\t\t\t\t\nRight putamen FC\t\t\t\t\t\t\nInsula\tR\t254.0\t39.0\t-9.0\t-6.0\t4.713\nTemporal pole\tL\t167.0\t-39.0\t-3.0\t-15.0\t4.343\nMiddle occipital gyrus\tL\t25.0\t-42.0\t-87.0\t-3.0\t3.162\nCaudate\tL\t33.0\t-15.0\t15.0\t18.0\t3.976\nMiddle cingulate gyrus\tR\t36.0\t12.0\t-6.0\t33.0\t3.208\nPD-A < PD-NA\t\t\t\t\t\t\nLeft putamen FC\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOrbitofrontal gyrus\tR\t13.0\t18.0\t60.0\t3.0\t-3.13\nRight putamen FC\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCerebellum\tR\t744.0\t51.0\t-63.0\t-48.0\t-5.199\nOrbitofrontal gyrus\tL\t143.0\t-6.0\t63.0\t-3.0\t-3.744\nPrecuneus\tR\t26.0\t0.0\t-45.0\t72.0\t-3.981\nPD-A > HC\t\t\t\t\t\t\nRight putamen FC\t\t\t\t\t\t\nParacentral lobule\tL\t20.0\t0.0\t-30.0\t63.0\t3.755\nParacentral lobule\tR\t21.0\t6.0\t-24.0\t75.0\t3.59\nPD-A < HC\t\t\t\t\t\t\nLeft putamen FC\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAnterior cingulate gyrus\tL\t35.0\t-12.0\t36.0\t3.0\t-4.136\nRight putamen FC\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOrbitofrontal gyrus\tL\t24.0\t-6.0\t39.0\t-9.0\t-3.49\nPD-NA > HC\t\t\t\t\t\t\nLeft putamen FC\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOrbitofrontal gyrus\tR\t107.0\t6.0\t63.0\t-21.0\t4.773\nRight putamen FC\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOrbitofrontal gyrus\tL\t16.0\t-18.0\t60.0\t-18.0\t3.954\nMiddle occipital gyrus\tL\t139.0\t-27.0\t-102.0\t-9.0\t4.113\nParacentral lobule\tR\t94.0\t6.0\t-27.0\t75.0\t3.922\nPD-NA < HC\t\t\t\t\t\t\nLeft putamen FC\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAnterior cingulate gyrus\tL\t185.0\t-9.0\t36.0\t3.0\t-3.962\nMiddle frontal gyrus\tL\t136.0\t-33.0\t42.0\t15.0\t-3.903\nPostcentral gyrus\tR\t117.0\t27.0\t-39.0\t48.0\t-4.222\nRight putamen FC\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCerebellum\tR\t23.0\t12.0\t-69.0\t-36.0\t-3.271\nMiddle frontal gyrus\tL\t18.0\t-15.0\t54.0\t3.0\t-3.012\nMiddle cingulate gyrus\tL\t18.0\t-3.0\t0.0\t33.0\t-3.501\n### Caption\nPair-wise differences in the putamen FC\n### Footer\nPost hoc two sample t-tests with age, gender, education, HAMD scores and grey matter volume as covariates were performed to test differences between groups on the putamen FC.

{"text": "Haller, Sven and Montandon, Marie-Louise and Rodriguez, Cristelle and Giannakopoulos, Panteleimon\nEur Radiol Exp, 2022\n\n# Title\n\nWearing a KN95/FFP2 facemask induces subtle yet significant brain functional connectivity modifications restricted to the salience network\n\n# Keywords\n\nCOVID-19\nDefault mode network\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nN95 respirators\nMasks\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nThe use of facemasks is one of the consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to search for subtle changes in brain functional connectivity, expected notably related to the high-level salience network (SN) and default mode network (DMN). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nProspective crossover design resting 3-T fMRI study with/without wearing a tight FFP2/KN95 facemask, including 23 community-dwelling male healthy controls aged 29.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.9\u00a0years (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation). Physiological parameters, respiration frequency, and heart rate were monitored. The data analysis was performed using the CONN toolbox. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWearing an FFP2/KN95 facemask did not impact respiration or heart rate but resulted in a significant reduction in functional connectivity between the SN as the seed region and the left middle frontal and precentral gyrus. No difference was found when the DMN, sensorimotor, visual, dorsal attention, or language networks were used as seed regions. In the absence of significant changes of physiological parameter respiration and heart rate, and in the absence of changes in lower-level functional networks, we assume that those subtle modifications are cognitive consequence of wearing facemasks. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe effect of wearing a tight FFP2/KN95 facemask in men is limited to high-level functional networks. Using the SN as seed network, we observed subtle yet significant decreases between the SN and the left middle frontal and precentral gyrus. Our observations suggest that wearing a facemask may change the patterns of functional connectivity with the SN known to be involved in communication, social behavior, and self-awareness. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Key points \n  \n  \nFacemasks have no significant effect on low-level cognitive networks. \n  \nFacemasks have subtle yet significant effect on high-level salience network interaction. \n  \nFacemask-related fMRI changes are not the consequence of respiration/heart rate modifications. \n  \n\n\n## Background \n  \nWearing a facemask in professional settings was usually restricted to medical personnel, and surgical facemasks were typically used. The COVID-19 pandemic changed this reality, including the wearing of facemasks in daily life interactions and in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning facilities. This practice is widely accepted and well tolerated, thought to be effective for infection prevention [ ]. \n\nIn principle, wearing a facemask should not limit sensorial processing or high-level abilities such as thinking, reading, and writing. However, by impacting social interaction, facemasks modify the neural responses to recognition of facial cues but also pivotal human abilities serving our daily behavior such as emotion recognition, perceived closeness, trust attribution, and even re-identification of unmasked faces [ \u2013 ]. Unlike behavioral paradigms, little is known about the effect of wearing a facemask on brain activation. The two available studies indicated that this practice has a subtle but still significant effect on cerebral blood flow and oxygen saturation but also blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) baseline signals [ ,  ]. In a series of 13 young individuals wearing a FFP2 facemask, Fischer et al. [ ] reported a 6.5% increase of cerebral blood flow and a 0.9% increase of oxygen saturation measured by transcranial hybrid near-infrared spectroscopy. In eight middle-aged subjects with a classical surgical facemask, Law et al. [ ] indicated an altered BOLD baseline signals with a minimal impact on task-related activation. \n\nTo our knowledge, no previous study explored the effect of wearing facemask in at rest functional connectivity. We opted for focusing on two main networks involved in complex prosocial behaviors, the salience network (SN) and default mode network (DMN) [ ]. Early studies showed that the patterns of functional connectivity of these networks are critically involved in various psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and dementias [ \u2013 ]. More recently, the interplay between these networks has been involved in the successful performance of social-cognitive tasks toward a close other [ ] as well as mentalizing performances [ ]. \n\nIn this study, we tested the hypothesis that wearing a facemask could induce changes in the at rest functional connectivity of these networks that may ultimately impact on our social interaction abilities. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis prospective study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University. \n\nHospitals and University of Geneva, Switzerland. The study was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants gave written informed consent. We included 24 community-dwelling cases recruited via advertisements in local media. One case was excluded from further analysis due to the incidental finding of an enlarged ventricular system. The final sample included 23 community-dwelling young men aged 29.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.9\u00a0years (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation) recruited via advertisements in local newspapers and social media. The following exclusion criteria were applied: (i) presence or history of a chronic psychiatric disorder (psychosis, bipolar disorder); (ii) history of loss of consciousness lasting longer than 30\u00a0min; (iii) history of head injury or post-concussion symptoms; (iv) history of auditory or visual deficits, seizure, and neurological disorders; and (v) regular use of psychotropic medications or alcohol. The exclusion of acute psychiatric disorders was confirmed by the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview [ ]. \n\n\n### fMRI acquisition protocol \n  \nThe study was performed during the COVID-19 pandemic (from 2021/01 to 2021/05). All participants wear facemasks before coming to the MRI facility. For the fMRI experiment, all participants had the same KN95/FFP2 (KN95, China GB2626-2006; FFP2, Europe EN 149\u20132001) facemask (a commercial model without metal to be safe in the 3-T MRI environment). We used a crossover design: half of the participants had first the mask (MASK) and then no mask (NOMASK), the other half had the inverse order. The entire MRI scanning lasted approximatively 1\u00a0h. We made sure that participants had the facemask on for 10\u00a0min before the start of MASK, and no facemask for 10\u00a0min before NOMASK. To avoid potential bias of the resting fMRI results due to basic physiologic parameters, we monitored breathing and heart rate during the fMRI runs. \n\nImages were acquired using a 3-T MRI scanner (Magnetom Prisma, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) at Campus Biotech Geneva ( ). An echo-planar resting-state fMRI echo-planar sequence and a three-dimensional T1-weighted sequence were acquired, the latter used for spatial normalization and registration. Technical parameters of both sequences are listed in Table  . Each participant performed two runs in a crossover design, once with and once without a KN95/FFP2 facemask. Heart rate and respiration data were collected continuously and simultaneously for resting-state functional imaging using   BIOPAC systems (   ).    \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence parameters \n  \n\n\n### Image analysis \n  \nImage analysis was performed using the CONN toolbox version 20b ( , RRID:SCR_009550). \n\n#### fMRI data preprocessing \n  \nfMRI data analysis was performed using the standard processing steps in the CONN toolbox as described in detail previously [ ]. Briefly, the data processing included motion correction, spatial filtering, denoising, and transformation into NMI standard space using the individual 3DT1 brain sequence for anatomic spatial registration. The fMRI data were then parcellated using the functional atlas included in the CONN toolbox. The functional regions of interest (ROIs) considered here included default mode network (DMN), sensorimotor network, visual network, SN, dorsal attention, frontoparietal, and language networks as well as cerebellum (control area). Each ROI was divided into subregions of interest. As an example, the relevant subregions for the SN were Salience ACC (anterior cingulate gyrus), Salience Alnsulal (left anterior insula), Salience Alnsular (right anterior insula), Salience RPFCl (left rostral prefrontal cortex), Salience RPFCr (right rostral prefrontal cortex, Salience SMGI (left supramarginal gyrus), and Salience SMGr (right supramarginal gyrus). Then, the functional time series were analyzed using the following two steps. \n\n\n#### ROI-to-ROI analysis \n  \nThe ROI-to-ROI connectivity metrics characterize the connectivity between all pairs of ROIs among a predefined set of regions. This atlas notably includes predefined set of regions for all of the networks considered. This ROI-to-ROI analysis examines the functional connectivity between each pair of ROIs, for example, that between DMN and SN. This pairwise ROI-to-ROI connectivity analysis was compared between MASK   versus   NOMASK conditions. \n\n\n#### Seed-to-voxel analysis \n  \nThe seed-based connectivity analysis aims to investigate functional properties from preselected seed regions. As seed regions, the same functional atlas-based regions were used as described above focusing on SN, DMN, visual, dorsal attention, frontoparietal, and language networks. Similar to the ROI-to-ROI analysis described above, a pairwise comparison between MASK   versus   NOMASK conditions was performed. \n\nBoth analyses used the same predefined atlas regions as ROI/Seed. The ROI-to-ROI only investigates functional connectivity between predefined ROIs but cannot detect functional connectivity changes in other (not predefined) regions. In contrast, seed-to-voxel analysis is able to detect functional connectivity changes of the preselected seed ROI to any unselected voxel of the brain without reference to predefined functional anatomic regions. \n\n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nData are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. Multiple-comparison correction was applied using the false discovery rate (FDR) [ ]  .   Concerning the seed-to-voxel analyses, parametric statistics (Gaussian Random Field theory) cluster threshold:   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 cluster-size p-FDR [ ] corrected; voxel threshold:   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 p-uncorrected. \n\n\n### Declarations \n  \nA first preprint non-peer-reviewed version of this paper has been published in ResearchSquare  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThere were no differences in heart rate or respiration rate between MASK and NOMASK conditions. The values provided by the MRI system   BIOPAC   are unitless values (for respiration frequency and pulse rate) and were for respiration 4.54\u2009\u00b1\u20091.55 (MASK)   versus   4.88\u2009\u00b1\u20091.54 (NOMASK),   p  \u2009=\u20090.460, and for pulse 0.12\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 (MASK)   versus   0.12\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 (NOMASK),   p  \u2009=\u20090.225. \n\nWe found no significant direct effect of wearing a facemask within the established resting state networks, including the SN, DMN, sensorimotor, visual, dorsal attention, or language networks. The resting fMRI seed-to-voxel analysis using the SN as the seed region revealed a significant reduction in a cluster in the left middle frontal and precentral gyrus for MASK   versus   NOMASK conditions (Fig.\u00a0 , Table  ).   \nThe functional connectivity seed-to-voxel (region of interest) analysis using the salience network as seed region resulted in one significant cluster in left middle frontal and precentral gyrus (threshold:   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 cluster-size;   p  -false discovery rate corrected). See Table  \n    \nSeed-to-voxel functional connectivity for the salience network (SN) as seed region \n  \nThe functional connectivity SEED-to-VOXEL (region of interest) analysis using the SN (salience network) as seed region resulted in one significant cluster of 151 voxels, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 .

The functional connectivity between the SN as seed region and this cluster was significantly (  p  -FDR\u2009<\u20090.001) lower for MASK   versus   NOMASK conditions. This effect was present for all seven subregions of the SN.   \nDetailed analysis of the significant cluster identified of the seed-to-voxel analysis using the salience network (SN) as seed region (see Fig.\u00a0 ). The functional connectivity between the SN and this cluster was significantly lower (  F  ([7 16]) 8.60;   p  -false discovery rate\u2009<\u20090.001) for MASK   versus   NOMASK conditions. Of note, this effect was present for all seven subregions of the SN \n  \n\nThere were no significant group differences using the DMN or sensorimotor, visual, dorsal attention, or language networks as seed regions. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present findings indicate that the effect of wearing a tight FFP2/KN95 facemask on brain functional connectivity was significant using the SN but not the DMN, sensorimotor, visual, dorsal attention, or language networks as seed regions. Basic physiological effect of altered breathing cannot be at the origin of the observed differences. This assumption is supported by two observations. First, we did not observe significant differences in the measured heart rate and respiration rate. Second, if the effect was a basic effect due to respiration, this effect should be present in all networks, including basic-level and high-level networks, but we observed a change in fMRI connectivity only in high-level SN. \n\nThe only previous study available in this field [ ] assessed the effect of wearing a facemask on functional MRI but with different approach and objectives. This study assessed task-related fMRI during a basic sensory-motor task designed to activate visual, auditory, and sensorimotor cortices in eight middle-aged participants. The authors reported an altered BOLD baseline signals with no impact on task-related activation of sensorimotor areas. In our study, resting-state fMRI analysis in 23 cases focused on functional connectivity of higher-level resting networks. We also report no significant effect of wearing facemask on the functional connectivity of lower-level sensorimotor or visual networks. In agreement with our a priori hypothesis, the effect of this practice was confined to an interaction between the SN as the seed region and the left middle frontal and precentral gyrus. Although subtle, this effect concerned all of the SN subregions and was statistically significant. \n\nThe clinical significance of this finding remains unclear. Altered functional connectivity of the SN with frontal and precentral areas was reported as part of a more global cortical disconnection in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including psychosis, poststroke depression, and attention deficit syndrome [ \u2013 ]. In young controls, the connectivity between the SN and left frontal as well as precentral areas is thought to be crucial not only for episodic memory skills [ ] but also for working memory activation [ ]. Our observations should be interpreted in conjunction with the recent report by Fischer et al. [ ] who reported a subtle but still significant increase of cerebral blood flow and oxygen saturation when using the same type of facemask. Taken together, these observations suggest that wearing a FFP2/KN95 facemask may lead to compensatory increase of brain metabolism and deficits of functional connectivity in the SN. This latter is involved in the detection of environmental stimuli and mediates the transition from the DMN to the central executive network [ ,  ]. Whether these changes are clinically silent or may predispose individuals to fail in highly demanding situations merits further consideration. Our observations should be viewed as a first step towards a more detailed analysis of facemask wearing repercussions in complex environments. In particular, the study of facemask wearing effect on brain activation in social interaction and mentalization paradigms, two main functions subserved by the SN, is a critical issue to address in order to get insight into the clinical significance of our work. \n\nSome limitations should be considered when interpreting the present findings. To avoid the well-documented gender-related differences in functional connectivity [ ], we included only male participants in this study. Although this procedure makes sense given the small series of cases that accepted this constraining experimental design, it naturally limits the generalizability of the present findings. Moreover, we deliberately used a tight FFP2/KN95 facemask, which many people prefer in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and are requested by most airline companies. We would expect smaller effects on brain functional connectivity when using less tight surgical facemasks, which was the standard facemask in the field of medicine before the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, the presence of physiological noise could impact the quality of fMRI data. Last but not least, the changes in functional connectivity reported may vary as a function of the length of the period that subjects wear the masks. Since no changes in physiological parameters related to wearing a facemask were observed in this series, it is highly likely that the reported result is probably stable over time.

However, few human studies have examined its mechanism of action. Therefore, the networks that mediate the therapeutic effects of thalamic DBS remain poorly understood. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nFive participants diagnosed with severe medically refractory TS underwent bilateral thalamic DBS stereotactic surgery. Intraoperative fMRI characterized the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response evoked by thalamic DBS and determined whether the therapeutic effectiveness of thalamic DBS, as assessed using the Modified Rush Video Rating Scale test, would correlate with evoked BOLD responses in motor and limbic cortical and subcortical regions. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nOur results reveal that thalamic stimulation in TS participants has wide-ranging effects that impact the frontostriatal, limbic, and motor networks. Thalamic stimulation induced suppression of motor and insula networks correlated with motor tic reduction, while suppression of frontal and parietal networks correlated with vocal tic reduction. These regions mapped closely to major regions of interest (ROI) identified in a nonhuman primate model of TS. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOverall, these findings suggest that a critical factor in TS treatment should involve modulation of both frontostriatal and motor networks, rather than be treated as a focal disorder of the brain. Using the novel combination of DBS-evoked tic reduction and fMRI in human subjects, we provide new insights into the basal ganglia-cerebellar-thalamo-cortical network-level mechanisms that influence the effects of thalamic DBS. Future translational research should identify whether these network changes are cause or effect of TS symptoms. \n\n   Highlights  \n  \nTranslational approach applied to Tourettes patients by utilizing combined DBS fMRI. \n  \nThalamic electrical stimulation evokes motor and limbic BOLD activation. \n  \nMotor and limbic BOLD activation differentially related to motor and vocal tics. \n  \nTic reduction negatively correlates with insula cortex, especially with motor tics. \n  \nSuppression of frontal and parietal networks correlate with vocal tic reduction. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOften presenting a constellation of unusual repetitive movement and vocalization behaviors, Tourette syndrome (TS) is a complex, developmental neuropsychiatric disorder. In many cases, it generally resolves with maturation, however, severe cases can persist into adulthood and can have a serious impact on patient quality of life and medical resources ( ). Clinically, TS is defined by persistent stereotypic motor and vocal tics, and by pre-tic premonitory urges or compulsions ( ;  ;  ). The combination of motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms ( ), suggests that the pathophysiology of TS is mediated by dysregulation of the basal ganglia-cerebellar-thalamo-cortical (BGCTC) networks, involving frontal, limbic and motor areas of the basal ganglia (BG) ( ;  ;  ). In support of both motor and limbic BG circuitry involvement in tic generation, utilizing in vivo electrophysiology and imaging, McCairn et al. found that in nonhuman primates (NHP), focal disinhibition of putamen (PT) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) can induce myoclonic (motor) and vocal (limbic) tics, respectively ( ). This led to the suggestion that, despite BG-located focal abnormalities, TS-like states should be considered as functionally specific, global network dysrhythmias ( ,  ,  ). \n\nFor participants with severe, medically refractory TS, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is increasingly considered a viable option ( ;  ;  ;  ). DBS is thought to relieve symptoms of conditions by applying relatively small amplitude electrical stimulation to dysfunctional brain networks and modulating pathological brain activity at the stimulation target site with up and downstream network effects playing a prominent role ( ;  ;  ). DBS of the thalamus has been reported to alleviate both motor and vocal tics in TS ( ), but its therapeutic and network mechanisms remain unknown. \n\nLocated in the posterior intralaminar thalamus, the centromedian and parafascicularis complex (CMPf) is uniquely situated to modulate both motor and limbic networks ( ;  ;  ) and has thus been considered a viable DBS target for TS ( ). As part of the diffuse thalamocortical projection system, the CMPf sends direct neuronal projections to limbic areas, including amygdala (AM) ( ), hippocampus (HP) ( ), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and insula ( ;  ). The CMPf also has extensive projections throughout the striatum (caudate/PT), NAc, and globus pallidus ( ;  ;  ;  ). The CMPf complex of thalamus provides unique access to both motor and limbic networks that has been shown to be related to complex tic behaviors in NHP-TS models ( ). \n\nHere, we address the proposed global network dysrhythmia hypothesis as inferred from NHP-TS studies by determining correlates of brain wide activity induced by DBS using high frequency stimulation (HFS) of the thalamus (CMPf) with reductions in TS symptoms (motor and vocal tics). DBS surgery was performed on participants with severe medically-refractive TS who exhibited complex motor and vocal tics. Thereafter, BGCTC network properties were assessed using intraoperative (intra-OR) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during thalamic HFS. This method has been previously used for thalamic HFS in essential tremor subjects ( ). Intra-OR fMRI results were correlated with post-operative behavioral scores to measure tic frequency, severity, and impairment levels in which participants and judges were blinded to stimulation parameters ( ;  ). To further separate the possible inter-correlation effects between vocal and motor tic reduction, standard and partial correlation methods were used to separate out the unique portions of variation in each behavioral measure that were associated with fMRI blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study included five participants (2 females, 3 males; mean age of 27\u202fyears) conducting a total of 25 fMRI scans with 12 tic behavioral score tests. The participants diagnosed with TS underwent bilateral CMPf DBS stereotactic surgery. The diagnosis of TS was based on the DSM-5307.22 diagnostic criteria for chronic motor and vocal (phonic) tic disorder ( ). All participants were approved for surgery by the Mayo Clinic DBS Committee, which is composed of neurologists, neurosurgeons, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, speech pathologists, and a biomedical ethicist. In all participants, TS symptoms predominantly affected the bilateral upper extremities with both simple and complex motor and vocal (phonic) tic, and in some participant's tremor also affected the head, jaw, and/or voice (Table S1). This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided written informed consent. Clinical trial name and number: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging During Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) to Treat Parkinson's Disease - NCT01809613; URL:  \n\n\n### Surgical approach \n  \nEach participant was secured within the Leksell\u2122 stereotactic head frame (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) and a 1.5\u202fT structural MRI (General Electric Signa HDx and 16\u00d7 software) scan was performed prior to implantation using magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence ( ). The MRI data were merged with a stereotaxy human brain atlas ( ), and stereotactic coordinates were identified for the CMPf thalamic complex (9.5\u201311.0\u202fmm posterior, 5.0\u20137.0\u202fmm lateral, 1.5\u20133.0\u202fmm inferior to the mid AC-PC line). Quadripolar 3387\u202fdB leads (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) were implanted bilaterally and lead placement was confirmed by computed tomography (Sensation 64, Siemens): image resolution: 0.59\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.59\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.00\u202fmm . With reference to a functional probabilistic human brain atlas ( ), post-hoc analysis of CT-MR fusion data of the region of thalamus occupied by the DBS lead electrode contacts implanted confirmed that they were centered on prefrontal and premotor thalamus (Supplementary Fig. S2). \n\n\n### Intraoperative functional MRI \n  \nThe intra-OR fMRI experiment was performed during pulse generator implantation surgery, 1\u202fweek after the DBS lead implantation surgery (for detailed methods, see ( )). After general anesthesia induction, a unilateral (right side) DBS lead was externalized under sterile conditions and attached to a custom wire connected to an external pulse generator (DualScreen 3628, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) outside the sterile field. To minimize the effects of susceptibility artifacts produced by subgaleal connectors, the laterality (right in five participants) of the connected lead was selected such that it was contralateral to the implantable pulse generator ( ). Participants were then moved into the magnet bore and all scans were conducted with participants under general anesthesia ( ). Average head specific absorption rate (SAR) values of <0.1\u202fW/kg were recorded during the fMRI study in all the participants, and a board-certified MRI physicist was present during all the sessions ( ). An anesthesia team was also present during all sessions and vital signs were continuously monitored. For all sequences, a manufacturer's standard transmit/receive RF head coil was used (1.5-T quadrature head coil, model 46-28211862; GE Healthcare, Maple Grove, MN). The fMRI was acquired using 2-dimensional gradient echo-echo planar imaging (GE-EPI): repetition time/echo time, 3000/50; flip angle, 90\u00b0; field of view, 22\u202f\u00d7\u202f22\u202fcm; matrix, 64\u202f\u00d7\u202f64; slice thickness, 3.5\u202fmm with a 0-mm gap thickness. For each acquisition, 135 volumes (the first five volumes were discarded for scanner equilibration) were acquired using a block paradigm, with five 6\u202fs stimulation periods (two volumes) alternated with six 60\u202fs rest periods (20 volumes), for a total time of 6\u202fmin 45\u202fs per run. A total of 25 fMRI runs were collected, with each participant undergoing 4\u20136 runs of fMRI in a single session with 2\u202fmin of rest between each run. Four runs were consistent across all five participants. Bipolar thalamic HFS (90\u202f\u03bcs width, 130\u202fHz, +3\u202fV) was applied to the right DBS lead with the following contact configurations: 0\u20131+, 2\u20133+ with minimum of two repetitions for the same contact configuration. By convention, contact \u20180\u2019 refers to the most ventrally-located contact on the quadripolar DBS lead, contact \u20183\u2019 is the most dorsally-located. The cathode or current source is denoted by \u2018\u2212\u2019, and \u2018+\u2019 refers to the passive/return contact. Following fMRI, participants were returned to the operating room for pulse generator implantation. \n\n\n### Tic score evaluation \n  \nAfter three months of active bilateral DBS of the CMPf, four out of five participants (one declined to participate) underwent the Modified Rush Video Rating Scale (mRVRS) test that allows double-blinded objective tic assessments ( ;  ). Each participant was blinded as to the stimulation settings, and underwent programming to three settings in succession, in a randomized order (n\u202f=\u202f12): sham DBS (off), dorsal contact DBS (bilateral; 2\u20133+; +3\u202fV; 130\u202fHz; 90\u202f\u03bcs), and ventral contact DBS (bilateral; 0\u20131+; +3\u202fV; 130\u202fHz; 90\u202f\u03bcs). During application of each stimulation setting, participants underwent 10\u202fmin of videotaping according to the mRVRS protocol. In brief, participants were placed in front of a video camera in a quiet room, and full frontal body (5\u202fmin) as well as close-up head and shoulder views (5\u202fmin) were recorded. Five domains were evaluated by a neurologist blinded to the conditions with subspecialty training in movement disorders: number of body areas involved with tics, motor tic intensity, vocal tic intensity, frequency of motor tics, and frequency of vocal tics. Reductions in mRVRS scores relative to sham stimulation (\u22bfmRVRS; positive values representing reductions in score) were evaluated by Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. \n\n\n### Functional MRI processing \n  \nFMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using AFNI (Analysis of Functional NeuroImages;  ) software packages ( ). The T1 anatomical image was aligned to the fifth volume of the EPI time series by affine registration using a local Pearson correlation cost function ( ). The first four volumes of the time series were removed to ensure that all remaining volumes in the time-series were at magnetization steady state. Despiking and rigid body registration were used to estimate subject movement during EPI scans and to correct for slice acquisition timing ( ). In all participants, estimated displacement due to head motion was <0.5\u202fmm in any given axis between successive time series volumes. The time series were then spatially transformed to the Talairach N27 brain template ( ) via affine transformation matrices estimated by registering T1-images to the N27 template. The spatially normalized EPI data were intensity scaled, and smoothed by a typical Gaussian blur of 4\u202fmm full-width at half-maximum. At the individual session level, the general linear model estimated the shape of the hemodynamic response with respect to the timing of stimulation. To account for baseline drift and residual motion artifact, regressors included six motion parameters estimated during co-registration and a third-order baseline drift function. A regressor was created for the above-mentioned blocked stimulation paradigm, and convolved with a gamma-variate hemodynamic response function. Following the general linear model process, 25 beta-coefficient maps were obtained for the entire subject group. To obtain the stimulation-evoked activation map, a group-level linear mixed-effects model was conducted to adjust for within-subject activation baselines, age, DBS contact, and voltage effects ( ;  ;  ). To confirm cortical ROIs, brain surface maps were created by performing cortical parcellation ( ). \n\n\n### Correlation between stimulation-evoked BOLD signal and tic reduction \n  \nFor correlation analysis, regions of interest (ROIs) were defined from the group activation map threshold at a significance level of family-wise error (FWE)-corrected p\u202f<\u202f0.05 (two-tailed; |t|\u202f>\u202f2.15; cluster size\u202f>\u202f840\u202fcm ). Beta coefficients were extracted from individual activation maps, averaged within each ROI to determine Pearson correlations between ROI-averaged beta values and the \u22bfmRVRS scores. In addition, individual voxels were identified that exhibited correlations between beta coefficient values and \u22bfmRVRS scores. For this analysis, a Monte Carlo simulation indicated that an initial, voxel-wise threshold of FWE-corrected p\u202f<\u202f0.05 was applied. As a final analysis, vocal and motor tic reduction scores were separated in the mRVRS score, and standard and partial correlation methods were applied to separate out the unique portions of variation in each measure that were associated with the BOLD signal changes. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Thalamic HFS modulated brain areas that are relevant to tic generation \n  \nIntra-OR fMRI during thalamic HFS showed both increased and decreased BOLD activation in BG-thalamic and cortical motor and limbic network areas. These regions mapped closely to major region of interest (ROI) identified in the NHP-TS model related to tic generation ( ; supplementary Fig. S1). Thalamic HFS resulted in significant (FWE-corrected p\u202f<\u202f0.05) BOLD signal changes across a wide range of brain networks: 1) frontal, including prefrontal cortex (PFC) and medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the ACC, 2) motor, including sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum; 3) BG and thalamic regions; 4) limbic, including AM, NAc, insula, and temporal lobe, including the parahippocampal gyrus in the medial temporal lobe; and 5) parietal and occipital lobes ( A and  ).   \nIntraoperative fMRI during thalamic HFS. (A) Thalamic HFS showing both significant (FWE-correct p\u202f<\u202f0.05) increases and decreases in BOLD activation in a number of network areas: 1) frontal: PFC, ACC, and OFC; 2) motor: sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum; 3) BG and thalamic regions; 4) limbic: AM, NAc, insula, and temporal lobe, including the parahippocampal gyrus in the medial temporal lobe; and 5) parietal and occipital lobes. (B) Brain cortical surface maps confirm increases in BOLD activity in the M1 that includes the entire motor strip (IL/RH), both increases and decreases in BOLD in the PFC (IL/RH), and decreases in BOLD in the ACC and OFC in both hemispheres. Decreases in BOLD were also found in the medial frontal cortex, including Brodmann's area 8 (IL/RH), increases in BOLD in the inferior parietal cortex (CL/LH), which includes Wernicke's area, and a wide range of increased BOLD activation in the parietal and occipital lobes in both hemispheres. See Fig. S3 and S4 for gray matter and white matter surface maps for anatomical confirmation.

Changes in BOLD, both increases and decreases, were observed in the PFC ipsilateral to the stimulation site in the right hemisphere (IL/RH), and decreases in BOLD in the ACC and OFC in both hemispheres. This included decreases in BOLD in the medial frontal cortex, as well as Brodmann's area 8 (IL/RH) that involves complex movement planning. In addition, increases in BOLD were also found in the inferior parietal cortex in the contralateral, left hemisphere (CL/LH), which included Wernicke's area. The surface map also confirmed a wide range of increases in BOLD activation in the parietal and occipital lobes in both hemispheres ( B). \n\n\n### Neural correlates of tic reduction by thalamic HFS \n  \nParticipants receiving thalamic HFS during clinical evaluation exhibited a significant reduction in tics (mean mRVRS score of 5.38 SEM\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.14) compared to participants receiving sham stimulation (mean mRVRS score of 7.25 SEM\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.98) (Wilcoxon signed rank test p\u202f<\u202f0.05) ( A).   \nNeural correlates of tic reduction by thalamic HFS. (A) Thalamic HFS resulted in lowering the mean mRVRS score (5.38 SEM\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.14) compared to no (sham) stimulation (mean mRVRS score of 7.25 SEM\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.98; p\u202f<\u202f0.05). (B) In subcortical structures, thalamic HFS resulted in reductions in tics correlating with decreases in BOLD (negative correlations) in the PT and NAc (IL/RH), and (C) reductions in tics correlating with increases in BOLD (positive correlation) in the cerebellum spanning deep cerebellar nuclei and lobules IV and V (CL/LH). (D) In cortical structures, tic reduction positively correlated with BOLD signals in the frontal cortex, including PFC, ACC, OFC, sensorimotor cortex corresponding to the hand, arm, and shoulder areas (IL/RH), and a wide range of parietal and occipital lobe regions (IL/RH and CL/LH). In contrast, tic reduction negatively correlated with BOLD signals in the medial frontal cortex (Brodmann's area 8), and insula (IL/RH), and Wernicke's area (CL/LH). Abbreviations: ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; BA 8, Brodmann's area 8; NAc, nucleus accumbens; PT, putamen; OFC, orbitofrontal cortex; PFC, prefrontal cortex; BOLD, blood\u2011oxygen-level dependent; HFS, high frequency stimulation; mRVRS, modified Rush Video Rating Scale, CL/LH, contralateral to the stimulation site in the left hemisphere; IL/RH, ipsilateral to the stimulation site in the right hemisphere; LH, left hemisphere; RH, right hemisphere. \n  Fig. 2   \n\nReductions in mRVRS score during thalamic HFS relative to sham stimulation (\u22bfmRVRS; positive values representing reductions in score) were used to correlate with the change in fMRI BOLD signal during thalamic HFS (\u22bfBOLD). The voxel-level correlation map was overlaid onto the fMRI activation surface map ( BCD). Tic reduction correlated with a complex pattern of both increases and decreases in BOLD signals. Positive correlations represent reductions in tics correlating with increases in BOLD and negative correlations represent reductions in tics correlating with decreases in BOLD. In subcortical regions, negative correlations were found in the PT and NAc (IL/RH) ( B). Positive correlations were observed in the cerebellum spanning deep cerebellar nuclei and lobules IV and V (CL/LH) ( C). For cortical regions ( D), positive correlations were observed in the frontal cortex that include PFC, ACC, and OFC (IL/RH). The sensorimotor cortex corresponding to the hand, arm, and shoulder areas also showed a positive correlation (IL/RH). In addition, a wide range of parietal and occipital lobe regions showed positive correlations (IL/RH and CL/LH). In contrast, a negative correlation was seen in the medial frontal cortex containing Brodmann's area 8 and insula (IL/RH). Wernicke's area in the inferior parietal cortex also exhibited a negative correlation (CL/LH). Areas in the temporal lobe showed mixed effects of both positive and negative correlations (IL/RH). The gray matter and white matter voxel-level correlation surface maps and fMRI activation surface maps are shown for anatomical confirmation in supplementary Figs. S3 and S4. \n\nROI-level correlation analysis was performed, as it would be less sensitive in spatial specificity compared to voxel-level analysis, but would have more representative values within the ROI ( , regions showing significant correlations in bold font). Consistent with voxel-level results, ACC, OFC, and occipital lobe showed positive correlations. ROI-level results revealed both positive and negative correlations in multiple temporal lobe regions (IL/RH and CL/LH), and positive correlations in the thalamus (IL/RH and CL/LH) and AM/NAc area (CL/LH). In contrast, ROI-level insula (IL/RH) showed a positive correlation inconsistent with voxel-level results (negative correlation). \n\n\n### Differential motor and limbic circuitry involvement in motor versus vocal tic production \n  \nWe have previously shown in the TS-NHP model that disinhibition of neural activity in the sensorimotor striatum (PT), via microinfusion of the GABA  antagonist bicuculline, induced motor tics in the orofacial region and/or the arm region, absence of vocal tics. In contrast, pharmacological disinhibition of the NAc (limbic) induced vocal tics that primarily expressed as repetitive grunts ( ). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) PET imaging revealed that activation in M1 and the cerebellum showed significantly greater activation during motor tic production than during vocal tic production (t\u202f>\u202f5.47, corrected p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S1A). In contrast, the ACC, AM, and HP was significantly greater during vocal tic production than during motor tic production (t\u202f>\u202f5.47, corrected p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S1B). Similarly, regional BOLD changes induced by thalamic HFS in the TS participants closely overlapped with the bicuculline-induced motor and vocal tic changes in regional rCBF in the NHP brain, where the brain areas of motor and vocal tic activity were affected by thalamic HFS (Fig. S1C). \n\n\n### Motor and vocal tic reduction by different circuit effects \n  \nDifferences in motor versus vocal tic reduction, as represented in the correlation map, were further investigated and found that there were distinct differences in the activation patterns. There was a negative correlation between motor tic reduction and BOLD signal in the sensorimotor cortex, insula, and BD 8 (IL/RH) ( A). In contrast, there was a negative correlation between vocal tic reduction and BOLD signal in the ACC in both hemispheres, and in the ipsilateral, right hemisphere's NAc and temporal lobe (IL/RH) ( B). Of note, these differential motor and vocal tic network effects are consistent with the NHP-TS results (Fig. S1ab). In the present study, both motor and vocal tic reductions had negative correlations with activation specific to the superior region of Wernicke's area in the inferior parietal cortex (CL/LH) ( AB). In addition, in the sensorimotor strip, vocal tic reduction correlated positively with BOLD generally covering the whole strip specifically including the face area, while motor tic reduction correlated negatively with BOLD only in the hand, arm, and shoulder areas. There were also a wide range of both positive and negative correlations among motor and vocal tic reduction and parietal and occipital lobe BOLD signal.   \nMotor and vocal tic reduction by different circuit effects. (A) Negative correlations between motor tic reduction and BOLD signals in the sensorimotor cortex, insula, and Brodmann's area 8 (IL/RH) and superior region of Wernicke's area (CL/LH). (B) Negative correlations between vocal tic reduction and BOLD signals in the ACC of both hemispheres, NAc and temporal lobe (IL/RH), and inferior region of Wernicke's area (CL/LH). In addition, in the sensorimotor strip, vocal tic reduction correlated positively with BOLD generally covering the whole strip specifically including the face area, while motor tic reduction correlated negatively with BOLD only in the hand, arm, and shoulder areas.

In addition, these same networks, both motor and limbic, are shown to be modulated by thalamic HFS in a symptom/network specific manner, and that these modulations strongly correlate with symptom improvement. \n\nThe application of brain imaging techniques and surgical interventions in individuals with TS and basic investigations in animal models have provided data into understanding the pathophysiology of TS (for review see ( ;  ;  ). Some important insights have come from NHP studies which have demonstrated that TS-like behavioral symptoms are associated with discrete neural networks ( ;  ) and these behaviors are underlined by specific, abnormal firing patterns within the BGCTC. Metabolic and electrophysiological studies have identified dysrhythmia in the BGCTC network during evoked motor tics with notable local field potential spikes and temporal coding of single-unit activity in the BG, cerebellum, and M1 ( ,  ). Vocal tics evoked by bicuculline-induced disinhibition of the NAc correlated with wide brain increases in measured blood flow on rCBF PET imaging in the limbic network that involved the ACC, AM, and HP ( ), with similar activity being reported for limbic pallidal disinhibition in anesthetized NHPs ( ). Similar electrophysiological abnormalities have been shown in the local field potential recordings in cortical BG recipient regions of the NAc. Enhanced coupling between subcortical and cortical regions were also associated with phase-phase coupling, especially in alpha brain wave activity (7\u201312\u202fHz) ( ). \n\nThe results from the present study add to a growing body of evidence that TS should be considered a disorder of large scale cortical and subcortical global networks ( ;  ). Traditionally TS was conceived as a focal disorder, relating to abnormal dopamine levels in the striatum, and subsequent dysregulation of action selection via indirect and direct pathways of the BG ( ). Notable recent studies have revealed distinct cortical motor network pathology, for example, thinning of sensorimotor cortex in children with TS relative to controls ( ), abnormally enhanced structural connectivity between sensorimotor cortex, thalamus, and striatum ( ), observations of reduced intracortical inhibition within the motor cortex ( ) and altered task-specific sensorimotor cortex activation ( ), which lends credence to the global network dysrhythmia hypothesis. \n\nWhile recent studies in rodents has demonstrated that interactions between the PT and motor cortex determine where (PT) and when (motor cortex) tics will occur ( ;  ), our results also support an extended network model and replicate previous findings showing significant activation/abnormality of the cerebellum during the production of tics ( ;  ;  ), and that the cerebellum is an integral part of the tic generating network. The cerebellum is known to have direct and indirect connections with the BG via intralaminar thalamic nuclei ( ). Therefore, it is possible that thalamic stimulation may directly activate the cerebellum or activate it indirectly through BG output and/or activation of cortico-cerebellar projections. \n\nTic reduction correlated with reduced activation in the striatum ipsilateral to stimulation. This result, perhaps not surprising, given the pervasive striatal projections originating in thalamic CMPf, supports the premise that CMPf stimulation can modulate ongoing striatal activity ( ). Individuals with TS display reduced striatal interneuron density ( ;  ), and selective inhibition of striatal interneuron activity has been shown to lead to TS-like behavior in NHP ( ). Previous studies have shown that stimulation of the CMPf can induce excitatory, as well as inhibitory, responses in the striatum ( ). In addition, electrical activation of the CMPf has been shown to induce GABAergic inhibition of striatal acetylcholine release ( ). \n\nSince projections from the CMPf are topographically organized and span motor, limbic, and associative portions of the striatum, one might predict that stimulation would induce downstream effects on cortical areas in each of these categories. Previous neuroimaging studies have shown hyperactive metabolism in a range of motor, associative, and limbic regions in TS ( ;  ;  ). The present study suggests that many of these regions, which include premotor and sensorimotor cortex, insula, temporal lobe, cingulate, and somatosensory association areas, are modulated by thalamic stimulation ( ). In addition, there are hypotheses linking the insula, ACC, and PFC to TS mechanisms mediating premonitory urge ( ;  ). Indeed, insula, ACC, and PFC activation have been shown to be correlated to premonitory urges as assessed in subjects undergoing a blink suppression test ( ;  ;  ). While resting state fMRI studies on TS show increased connectivity in the insula and the sensorimotor cortex ( ), the present results also show that tic reduction highly correlates with the BOLD signal changes in those areas, especially with motor tics. Therefore, thalamic stimulation might act through the insula and sensorimotor cortices to affect the premonitory urge-related motor tic response. \n\nSome technical limitations must be considered for the results of this study. First, anesthesia may influence the DBS-evoked BOLD signal because patients received both inhaled halogenated ether anesthetic and intravenous fentanyl during fMRI acquisition. Second, the DBS electrode created a susceptibility artifact that reduced the strength of the BOLD signal along the electrode trajectory ( ). The artifact could lead to an underestimation of DBS-evoked BOLD in the immediate vicinity of the electrodes, which may have affected the results of our correlation analyses within that region. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOverall, the present study shows that thalamic HFS in TS participants has wide-ranging effects that impact the frontostriatal, limbic, and motor networks. These findings suggest that thalamic HFS may suppress striatal output and reduce tic production via downstream effects in both the frontal and motor cortices. Furthermore, the present results suggest that the suppression of the motor and insula networks correlate with motor tic reduction, whereas suppression of frontal and parietal networks correlate with vocal tic reduction, implying it would be a critical factor to modulate both frontostriatal and motor networks for treatment of TS. Our study also provides unique translational information supporting the NHP-TS model. Future studies in clinical and preclinical research will be necessary to identify whether these network changes are cause or effect of TS symptoms. \n\n\n## Declarations of interest \n  \nAll authors report no biomedical financial interests or potential conflicts of interest. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: t0005\n### Label: Table 1\nRegions\tVolumemm3\tCoordinates(x, y, z)\tMaxt-Score\tCorrelation coefficient\nCerebellar\tCerebellar\tCerebellar\tCerebellar\tCerebellar\nIL cerebellum\t1104\t\u221215, +61, \u221216\t+4.91\t+0.42\nCL cerebellum\t6072\t+9, +57, \u221222\t+6.25\t+0.63*\n\t\t\t\t\nCortices and gyri\tCortices and gyri\tCortices and gyri\tCortices and gyri\tCortices and gyri\nIL/CL cuneus/precuneus/isthmus cingulate cortices\t4584\t+1, +71, +20\t+7.19\t\u22120.48\nIL/CL caudal/rostral anterior cingulate cortices\t2920\t\u22129, \u221231, +6\t\u22124.44\t+0.08\nIL/CL anterior cingulate/medial orbitofrontal cortices\t1048\t\u221211, \u221251, +4\t\u22122.64\t+0.66*\nIL lateral orbitofrontal cortex\t744\t\u221241, \u221217, \u221212\t\u22124.04\t+0.86*\nCL lateral orbitofrontal cortex\t1696\t\u221243, \u221237, \u22126\t\u22122.32\t+0.18\nIL medial frontal gyrus\t1208\t\u22127, \u221225, +44\t\u22123.13\t\u22120.32\nIL insula\t824\t\u221241, \u221215, \u22124\t\u22124.32\t+0.65*\nIL lateral occipital/lingual/pericalcarine gyri\t2640\t\u22129, +69, +8\t+4.94\t+0.43\nCL lateral occipital/lingual/pericalcarine gyri\t2448\t+17, +65, \u221212\t+6.29\t+0.58*\nIL inferior parietal cortex\t312\t\u221245, +55, +18\t+2.85\t+0.22\nCL inferior parietal cortex\t2160\t+39, +53, +26\t+2.62\t\u22120.26\nCL superior parietal cortex\t304\t+11, +67, +50\t+4.85\t+0.30\nIL sensorimotor cortex\t9696\t\u221249, +11, +28\t+4.26\t+0.29\nIL superior/medial/inferior temporal cortices\t1496\t\u221239, \u22125, \u221214\t\u22124.70\t+0.79*\nCL superior temporal/pars orbitalis cortices\t1208\t+39, \u221221, \u221212\t\u22122.94\t+0.74*\nIL inferior temporal gyrus\t1488\t\u221241, +7, \u221222\t+3.36\t\u22120.86*\n\t\t\t\t\nSubcortical structures\tSubcortical structures\tSubcortical structures\tSubcortical structures\tSubcortical structures\nIL caudate/pallidum/putamen\t3384\t\u221215, +1, +22\t\u22125.53\t\u22120.23\nCL caudate/pallidum/putamen\t1992\t+19, +7, +16\t\u22124.77\t\u22120.11\nIL/CL thalamus\t3480\t\u221213, +23, +8\t+9.94\t+0.63*\nIL amygdala/accumbens area\t392\t\u221229, +9, \u221210\t\u22126.34\t\u22120.18\nCL amygdala/accumbens area\t1272\t+5, \u22125, \u221214\t\u22123.74\t+0.80*\nBrain stem\t2088\t\u22121, +21, \u221218\t+6.97\t\u22120.18\n### Caption\nThalamic HFS-Evoked BOLD Signals and Tic Reduction Correlation (ROI-level).\n### Footer\nRegions showing significant correlations in bold (* FWE-corrected p\u202f<\u202f0.05).

As part of the longitudinal National Consortium on Adolescent Neurodevelopment and Alcohol study, participants (N = 113, baseline age: 12\u201321) completed a rewarded antisaccade task during fMRI, with up to three time points. We examined whether substance use risk factors, including psychopathology (externalizing, internalizing) and family history of substance use disorder, were associated with developmental differences in inhibitory control performance and BOLD activation. Among the examined substance use risk factors, only externalizing psychopathology exhibited developmental differences in inhibitory control performance, where higher scores were associated with lower correct response rates (p = .013) and shorter latencies (p < .001) in early adolescence that normalized by late adolescence. Neuroimaging results revealed higher externalizing scores were associated with developmentally-stable hypo-activation in the left middle frontal gyrus (p < .05 corrected), but divergent developmental patterns of posterior parietal cortex activation (p < .05 corrected). These findings suggest that early adolescence may be a unique period of substance use vulnerability via cognitive and phenotypic disinhibition. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAcross the lifespan, problematic substance use has been linked to impairments in inhibitory control: the ability to regulate prepotent behaviors to facilitate goal-directed behaviors ( ). However, substance use initiation and escalation typically begin during adolescence ( ), when inhibitory control is still developing and ongoing brain maturation and specialization support the transition to adulthood ( ;  ). To this end, it has been suggested that diverging developmental trajectories of inhibitory control and other higher-order cognitive functions may increase vulnerability to problematic substance use ( ,  ), by way of early substance use experimentation ( ) and individual differences in psychiatric symptoms ( ) that frequently co-occur with problematic substance use ( ;  ). Supporting this perspective, recent work from our group has demonstrated that substance use risk factors, specifically externalizing psychopathology and impulsivity, are associated with poor inhibitory control and cortical activation differences among adolescents during an antisaccade task( ). However, it remains unclear whether certain periods of development are more sensitive to inhibitory control limitations associated with substance use vulnerability and if youth at risk for substance use follow different trajectories of neurocognitive development. \n\nNeuroimaging studies suggest that the protracted development of inhibitory control during adolescence relies on functional changes in brain regions supporting cognitive control across the lifespan, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex ( ;  ). Supporting a potential role of these regions in vulnerability to problematic substance use, poor response inhibition and reduced activation within the prefrontal cortex during inhibitory control tasks have been shown to predict problematic substance use in adolescence ( ;  ). Similarly, prior work demonstrates that, relative to healthy controls, adolescents with a family history of substance use disorders, who have an increased risk for problematic substance use ( ), exhibit divergent age-related activation differences within brain regions supporting inhibitory control, including the middle cingulate and frontal gyrus ( ). However, the field has yet to evaluate such relationships within the context of broader substance use risk factors, including dimensional measures of psychopathology. This prevents a comprehensive understanding of the developmental etiology of problematic substance use. Furthermore, given that earlier substance use initiation is associated with increased risk for substance use dependence, previous work suggests that early adolescence may represent a sensitive period for substance abuse ( ). Thus, characterizing the extent to which certain substance use risk factors might be associated with developmental differences in inhibitory control during distinct periods of adolescence is critical for developmentally-informed prevention and intervention ( ). \n\nLeveraging a large longitudinal sample that performed an antisaccade inhibitory control task during fMRI acquisition as part of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) study, the current project characterized developmental differences in inhibitory control associated with substance use risk factors, including externalizing and internalizing psychopathology and family history of substance use disorder. Based on previous work implicating poor response inhibition in externalizing psychopathology, a latent construct characterized by behavioral undercontrol and impulsivity ( ), and prior work examining non-developmental main effects of externalizing psychopathology and impulsivity within a subset of the current sample ( ), we predicted that externalizing psychopathology would be associated with poor inhibitory control and reduced activation in regions supporting cognitive control, including the prefrontal cortex. Critically however, and novel to the current project, we further hypothesized that at-risk youth would follow developmental trajectories of inhibitory control that diverged from normative patterns, as would be predicted by current theories suggesting that neurodevelopmental limitations in cognitive control may underlie adolescent substance use vulnerability ( ). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were part of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Site of the NCANDA study. See   for complete study protocol. Briefly, an accelerated longitudinal design was used to study adolescent brain development starting at various baseline ages (12\u201321 years of age) with longitudinal follow ups. At the time of manuscript preparation, data collection included up to three time points (i.e., baseline and two annual follow-ups). In the interest of studying substance use risk and eventual initiation and escalation, initial enrollment for the NCANDA study targeted youth at risk for substance use based on measures of psychopathology and family history of substance use disorders (see   2.2  ) but with limited substance use. The study aimed to achieve a sample that consisted of approximately 50 % of participants at risk for substance use. Exclusion criteria included contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; e.g., non-removable metal implements), medical history that would compromise MRI (e.g., traumatic brain injury), and a current or persistent major psychiatric disorder that would interfere with testing (e.g., psychosis). The study protocol was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. Informed consent and assent were obtained from adults and minors, respectively. Participants were compensated for their participation. \n\nAfter excluding testing sessions (subject at visit) based on study-specific criteria (see   2.4   for behavioral exclusion criteria), the final sample for the current project included 113 participants (baseline age ranged from 12.27 to 21.96, M = 17.11, SD = 2.66). For the behavioral analysis, a total of 220 sessions were included. Among the sample, 41.6 % (n = 47) of subjects had data which met study-specific inclusion criteria for baseline and follow-up and 26.5 % (n = 30) had data which met study-specific criteria at all three time points. The final neuroimaging sample included 104 participants and a total of 183 sessions, with 45.6 % (n = 47) of the sample having data at both baseline and follow-up and 15.4 % (n = 16) of the sample having data across all three visits (see   2.6.2   for neuroimaging exclusion criteria). See   for sample age distribution and   for sample characteristics.   \nAge distribution of sample. Primary behavioral sample included 113 participants and a total of 220 sessions. Top: Longitudinal structure of the project, where horizontal lines connect subjects\u2019 visits (filled circles). Bottom: Density plot of subject age across all visits. \n  Fig. 1     \nSample characteristics. \n  Table 1     \n\n\n### Measures \n  \n#### Substance use \n  \nThe primary focus of the current study was to characterize developmental trajectories of substance use risk factors. Thus, problematic substance use examined as a covariate in all analyses in order to account for inhbitory control differences that may be related to problematic substance use ( ). This variable was defined at baseline using an established scoring protocol from the Customary Drinking and Drug Use Record (CDDR;  ), where substance use was coded categorically and indicated whether participants exceeded age-specific National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines for risky drinking (Exceeds Threshold Drinking; ETD; n = 29). This variable was selected for primary analysis to match our work with this sample using baseline and one-year follow-up data ( ). Furthermore, problematic substance use beyond this baseline characterization was uncommon in the final behavioral sample (weekly binge drinking: n = 17, weekly marijuana use n = 14; see Supplementary Methods for details), reflecting the isolation of substance use risk and relatively minimal levels of problematic substance use at this stage of the Pittsburgh NCANDA sample. \n\n\n#### Substance use risk factors \n  \nConstructs indexing substance use risk in the current project, externalizing and internalizing psychopathology and family history of substance use disorder, were defined with regard to the original design of NCANDA (see  ). Externalizing (EXT) and internalizing (INT) psychopathology were assessed using the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessments (ASEBA;  ). Participants younger than 18 completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR), while participants older than 18 completed the Adult-Self-Report after the age of 18 (ASR). Critically however, these scales are designed to measure the same latent externalizing and internalizing structures, but with developmentally-appropriate questions. Age and gender adjusted t-scores were used as continuous measures for both EXT and INT. The ASEBA measures were collected at each visit. Family history of substance use disorder was assessed using the Family History Assessment Module ( ) and was defined at baseline as having at least one biological parent or grandparent with substance use disorder symptoms (FH;   n   = 22). See   for correlations amongst substance use risk factors and other study variables.   \nCorrelations amongst risk and sociodemographic factors of interest. \n  Table 2     \n\n\n#### Generalized cognitive ability and sociodemographic factors \n  \nA composite measure of cognitive function, generalized cognitive ability accuracy (GA), was assessed with the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery ( ) and \u201cpaper and pencil\u201d neuropsychological tests ( ). GA was used as a covariate (see   2.5   for covariate procedures) in analyses of inhibitory control performance and brain activation in order to provide broader context of any developmental patterns of substance use risk factors associated with antisaccade performance. This covariate is critical within the context of previous work characterizing antisaccade performance and inhibition as a domain-general cognitive function ( ). Specifically, since the GA measure evaluates several cognitive domains, this score allowed us to examine whether the developmental associations of substance use risk factors with antisaccade performance were specific to inhibitory control, while accounting for general differences in cognition. Similarly, gender and Socioeconomic Status (SES;  ), which was measured as a composite of parental education and income, were also examined as covariates to provide broader sociodemographic context of substance use vulnerability (cf.,  ). GA and SES information were defined from baseline visit data. Sessions missing GA (n = 2) and SES (n = 14) data were excluded from analyses examining these variables. \n\n\n\n### Rewarded antisaccade task \n  \nParticipants completed a rewarded antisaccade task during fMRI acquisition initially described by Geier et al. (2010;  ) and reported in prior work from our group on an earlier portion of this sample ( ). Briefly, each trial consisted of cue, preparation, and response epochs lasting 1.5 s each. During the cue epoch, participants viewed a white fixation cross surrounded by a ring of green \u201c$\u201d symbols, indicating that a trial would be rewarded if a correct antisaccade was performed, or a ring of blue \u201c#\u201d, indicating a neutral trial in which no money was at stake. The preparation epoch was indicated by a red fixation cross and prompted participants to prepare for the response epoch, during which participants were to make a saccade in the mirror location of a yellow dot that appeared in unpredictable locations along the horizontal meridian at 1 of 6 eccentricities (\u00b13, 6, and 9 degrees visual angle, relative to fixation). In addition to these \u201cfull trials\u201d, additional partial trials, which consisted of either solely the cue epoch or the cue and preparation epochs but not the response epoch, were presented in order to aid in the estimation of hemodynamic responses evoked during each epoch ( ; see   2.6.4  ). Participants completed four neuroimaging runs, each consisting of 28 full trials (14 neutral, 14 reward) and 12 partial trials (3 of each partial trial by reward type). Prior to starting the task, participants were told that they could earn up to $25.00 but were not informed of the exact amount of monetary rewards for each correct trial. This was done to prevent participants from tallying their earnings, potentially engaging non antisaccade-specific brain systems (e.g., working memory).   \nRewarded antisaccade task ( ). \n  Fig. 2   \n\n\n### Eye movement measurement and scoring \n  \nAntisaccade task stimuli were presented using E-Prime on a flat screen positioned behind the MRI scanner, which was visible to the participant through a mirror mounted on the MRI head coil. Eye movements were tracked using a long-range optics eye-tracking system (Applied Science Laboratories, Bedford, MA) that recorded eye positions through corneal reflections. At the beginning of each experimental session, a 9-point calibration was conducted to ensure accurate characterization of saccades for each participant. \n\nAntisaccade scoring followed the same procedure as prior work from our group ( ;  ). A correct antisaccade was defined by an eye movement with a velocity of at least 30 degrees/s and 2.5 \u00b0 visual angle from central fixation to the mirror location of the peripheral target ( ). Antisaccade errors were defined as those with an initial saccade toward the target that extended at least 2.5\u00b0 visual angle (i.e. prosaccade). An error corrected trial was specified by an initial saccade toward the target and extended at least 2.5\u00b0 visual angle from central fixation followed by a correct antisaccade to the mirror location. In the current project, both antisaccade errors and error-corrected antisaccades were considered errors in both behavioral and neuroimaging analyses. Trials in which the participant failed to make any saccade or had poor eye tracking were considered dropped trials and were excluded from all analyses. Testing sessions (subject at visit) were excluded from both behavioral and neuroimaging analyses if the proportion of dropped trials exceeded 30 % and/or if 50 % of total trials were dropped or missing due to incomplete acquisition. The overall proportion of dropped trials was low across visits (10.6 % at baseline, 11.3 % at the second visit, and 10.9 % at the third visit) and was not associated with substance use risk factors (Supplementary Table 1). \n\n\n### Antisaccade behavioral performance \n  \nBehavioral analyses were performed in R 3.1.2 ( ). Generalized mixed-effects regression models with a logit link function (lme4 package in R,  ) were used to predict antisaccade correct response rate across trial-wise data. This logit link function was appropriate considering the binomial structure of the trial-level data (correct vs. incorrect). Critically, the use of generalized mixed effect models with trial-wise data reduces ceiling effects in mean accuracy distributions ( ). Random intercepts were estimated for each subject. Reward conditions (reward, neutral), age, visit, ETD, and substance use risk factors (EXT, INT, FH) were entered as fixed effects in a series of models (see below). Antisaccade latencies were modeled similarly but using linear mixed effects models and only included correct trials. Significance values were obtained through the Car package in R ( ). Potential leverage points were examined on session-mean performance metrics using cook\u2019s distance with a threshold of 1. Only one session (subject at visit) exceeded this threshold and the pattern of significant results was unchanged when excluding this session. Consequently, this session was retained in the final analyses. \n\nDue to correlations among risk factors, a series of models were employed. First, to examine main effects, the association between antisaccade performance and each risk factor was first modelled separately. Next, given the interest in studying developmental trajectories of inhibitory control amongst substance use risk factors, each risk factors\u2019 interaction with age was examined. Subsequently, in order to address the specificity of results, all other risk factors were included as covariates. Lastly, to account for sociodemographic effects and general cognitive differences, GA and SES were included as covariates in both main effect and interaction models. Unless otherwise noted, inferences are drawn only on those risk factors that remain significant across all models. \n\n\n### fMRI \n  \n#### Acquisition \n  \nNeuroimaging data were collected at the Magnetic Resonance Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh on a 3.0-T Siemens Magnetom TIM Trio. A magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) pulse sequence with 160 slices (1.2 \u00d7 0.938 \u00d7 0.938) was used to create structural images for functional registration and conversion into a standardized template. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) data were acquired using an axially acquired echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (field of view = 200 mm, 64 \u00d7 64 matrix, 3.125 \u00d7 3.125 \u00d7 3.200 mm anisotropic voxels, 29 slices, TR = 1.5 s, TE =28 ms, flip angle = 73\u00b0). \n\n\n#### Preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing of fMRI data followed the same procedures as other recent task-based fMRI from our group ( ;  ;  ). This included the removal of motion and noise artifacts (Analysis of Functional Neuroimages, AFNI; 3dDespike;  ), non-linear registration of functional data to a standardized structural brain (3 mm, MNI-152 template; 2009c), slice timing and motion correction (mcflirt;  ). Data was then smoothed with FWHM of 5 mm (SUSAN;  ) and a 0.00625 Hz high-pass filter was applied. Finally, data was scaled by 10,000 of the global median. Sessions were excluded if session-wise mean Euclidean norm head motion exceeded 0.9 mm (n = 5), there was poor EPI coverage across runs upon visual inspection (n = 3), or due to technical error (n = 8). \n\n\n#### Trial-level fMRI analysis \n  \nConsistent with prior work using a subset of this sample ( ), we estimated BOLD responses at both the trial and epoch level. To estimate average trial-level BOLD responses, a general linear model estimating BOLD activation was generated using AFNI\u2019s 3dDeconvolve tool. Trial types (reward, neutral) were modelled separately with a 4,500 ms boxcar convolved with a gamma function (AFNI's block 4). Individual regressors for correct, error-corrected, and dropped trials were modeled for each trial condition. We note that incorrect non error-corrected:   see 2.4  ) antisaccades were rare in the sample overall (less than 1 % of total trials) and did not occur in all subjects (69/104). Therefore, in order to ensure consistency of modeling across all subjects, these trials were modeled with the dropped trials. Partial trials were modelled similarly but with a 1,500 ms boxcar for cue partial trials and 3000 ms boxcar for cue and preparatory partial trials. Six rigid-body head motion parameters, their first order derivatives, as well as run-wise 0 through 3  order polynomials were included as nuisance regressors. TRs were censored if Euclidean norm head motion exceeded 0.9 mm. \n\n\n#### Epoch-level fMRI analysis \n  \nPrevious research has shown that BOLD activation varies amongst the epochs of this rewarded antisaccade task as participants assess reward contingencies, prepare a response, and execute an antisaccade response ( ). Therefore, we also estimated the BOLD response within individual epochs in a second model. Each epoch (cue, preparation, and response) was modeled as a separate regressor with a boxcar (1.5 s duration, scaled to an amplitude of 1; AFNI\u2019s block 4) and convolved with a gamma function. Correct, error-corrected, and dropped/incorrect trials were modeled separately for each trial condition (Reward, Neutral) and each epoch. Partial trials were included as examples of each epoch to aid in the estimation of epoch-specific BOLD response ( ). Nuisance regressors and motion censoring methods followed the same procedure as the trial-level deconvolution. \n\n\n#### Voxelwise Analysis \n  \nWe examined main effects of substance use risk factors and their interactions with age in whole-brain voxelwise analyses predicting BOLD activity during correct antisaccade trials (AFNI\u2019s 3dlme;  ). All fMRI analyses covaried for session-wise mean Euclidean norm head motion, visit number, and trial type (reward, neutral). Each model was tested on both trial-level and individual epoch-level BOLD parameter estimates. Voxelwise testing was limited to voxels with at least a 50 % probability of being gray matter in the MNI-152 template and full EPI coverage across the sample. Multiple comparison correction was conducted using a combination of cluster size and voxel significance. Parameters for thresholding were determined using AFNI\u2019s updated 3dClustSim program (acf option), which determines cluster size threshold through Monte Carlo simulations based on averaged spatial autocorrelation parameters. Autocorrelation parameters were estimated from residuals of the subject-level deconvolution models with AFNI\u2019s updated 3dfwhmx tool (acf option). This analysis specified that at least 20 contiguous voxels (faces-touching, AFNI\u2019s NN1) initially thresholded at p = .005 were necessary to achieve cluster-level corrected alphas of less than 0.05 for both trial-level and epoch-level analyses. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Antisaccade behavioral performance \n  \n#### Reward and age effects \n  \nThe average antisaccade correct response rate (accuracy) was 78.85 % (SD = 15.69 %) and the average latency was 438.53 ms (SD =57.5 ms). Both accuracy (z = 4.98,   X   = 24.78, p < 0.001) and latency (t =-3.66,   X   = 13.36, p < 0.001) robustly improved with age (higher accuracies and shorter latencies with increasing age). Consistent with prior work using this task (Geier et al., 2010) and analyses within a subset of this sample ( ), rewarded trials were associated with greater correct response rates (z = 9.23,   X   = 85.01, p < 0.001) and shorter latencies (t =-7.60,   X   = 57.37, p < 0.001). Given that our prior work with a subset of this sample ( ) and the current project revealed non-significant interactions between reward conditions and substance use risk factors (Supplementary Table 2), additional higher-order interactions with trial type (reward, neutral), age, and risk-factors, were not explored. However, trial type was treated as a covariate in all behavioral and neuroimaging analyses. \n\n\n#### Main effects of substance use risk factors \n  \n Accuracy.   When considering main effects across the sample, both EXT (  z   = -2.05,   X   = 4.21,   p   = 0.04) and INT (  z   =-3.24,   X   =10.51,   p   = 0.001) had negative relationships with AS correct accuracy, suggesting that higher levels of these risk factors are associated with poorer antisaccade performance. Only INT (  z   =-2.16,   X   = 4.68,   p   = 0.02) continued to negatively be associated with AS accuracy when all risk factors were considered in a joint model. Both EXT (  z   = -2.15,   X   = 6.31,   p   = 0.01) and INT (  z   = -3.58,   X   = 12.82,   p   < 0.001) continued to be negatively associated with AS accuracy when covarying for GA and SES. FH and ETD did not predict AS accuracy ( ).   \nMain effects and age interactions predicting antisaccade performance. \n  Table 3     \n\n Latency of correct trials.   Greater INT scores (  t   =-3.01,   X   = 9.04,   p   = 0.003) were associated with shorter latencies. This relationship remained significant when considering all other risk factors (  t   = -2.22,   X   = 4.95,   p   = 0.006). Further, INT (  t   = -3.62,   X   = 13.14,   p <   0.001) continued to be negatively associated with latency when controlling for GA and SES. EXT, FH, and ETD were not associated with main effects of latency ( ). As in the accuracy analyses, no other risk factors had significant interactions with age associated with latency. \n\n\n#### Risk factor interactions with age \n  \n Accuracy  . EXT significantly moderated age-related improvements in AS accuracy (  z   = 2.48,   X   = 6.15,   p   = 0.013,  a). The Johnson-Neyman technique, which specifies intervals of significance within continuous by continuous interaction terms ( ), indicated that greater EXT scores were associated with poorer AS accuracy in early adolescence until normalizing to the rest of the sample at approximately 17 years old ( a). The interaction between EXT and age remained significant when accounting for INT, FH and ETD (  z   = 2.64,   X   = 6.99,   p   = 0.008), as well as when covarying for GA and SES (  t   = 2.00,   X   = 3.99,   p   = 0.046). No other risk factors had significant interactions with age.   \n*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. Individual differences in externalizing psychopathology (EXT) moderate age-related improvements in antisaccade accuracy (Panel A, left) and latency (Panel B, left). For Johnson-Neyman plots (generated from interactions R package;  ), darker blue colors reflect significant effects of EXT (p < 0.05) predicting antisaccade performance during the indicated age ranges (Panel A Panel B right). Shaded regions represent 95 % confidence intervals. \n  Fig. 3   \n\n Latency of correct trials  . EXT also moderated age-related change in latency, where greater EXT scores were associated with reduced latency in early adolescence (  t   = 3.63,   X   = 13.18,   p   < 0.001;  b). This relationship persisted when covarying for all other risk factors (  t   = 3.96,   X   = 15.69,   p   < 0.001) and when accounting for GA and SES (  t   = 2.84,   X   = 8.06,   p   = 0.004). As in the accuracy analysis, no other risk factors had significant interactions with age. \n\n Speed-Accuracy Relationships in Externalizing Psychopathology.   Given the evidence for high externalizing participants to have lower accuracy and shorter latencies in correct responses during early adolescence, we performed a secondary analysis to examine potential speed-accuracy trade-offs as a function of externalizing psychopathology and age. This analysis revealed a significant three-way interaction between latency, age, and EXT when predicting correct response rate (  z   = 3.04,   X   = 9.27,   p   = 0.002) such that there was a significant relationship between externalizing psychopathology, latency and accuracy only in early adolescence. Specifically, in early adolescence, externalizing scores were associated with decreased antisaccade accuracy and these accuracy differences were largest for longer latencies. Thus, these results were not consistent with a typical speed-accuracy trade-off, where a lower correct response rate is driven by shorter latencies. See Supplementary Fig. 1 for visualization of accuracy and latency as a function of age and externalizing. \n\n\n#### Sociodemographic relationships \n  \nFemales had significantly shorter latencies (  t   = 3.82,   X   = 14.55,   p   < 0.001). Greater GA scores were associated with improved accuracy (  z   = 2.94,   X   = 8.64,   p   = 0.003). Further, GA (  z   = -3.08,   X   = 9.40,   p   = 0.002; Supplementary Fig. 2a.) and SES (  z   = -2.66,   X   = 7.09,   p   = 0.008; Supplementary Fig. 2b.) interacted with age to predict antisaccade accuracy, with patterns that mirrored the interaction between EXT and age. \n\n\n\n### Functional neuroimaging \n  \n#### Head motion \n  \nAs has been well-described in previous developmental research, head motion was greater at younger ages (  t   =-2.74,   X   = 7.55,   p   < 0.001). No risk factors were associated with head motion or interacted with age to predict head motion. However, as described in the methods section, TRs during which Euclidean norm head motion distances exceeded 0.9 mm were excluded and all fMRI analyses covaried for average session-wise Euclidean norm head motion. \n\n\n#### Main effects of substance use risk factors \n  \nIn the interest of studying developmentally-relevant brain-behavior relationships, only significant main effects and risk factor by age interactions from the behavioral analyses were followed-up in neuroimaging analyses. At the trial-level, greater EXT scores predicted decreased activation in the left middle frontal gyrus ( ; Supplementary Table 3). Average activation within this cluster had a positive relationship with antisaccade accuracy (proportion of correct trials;   t   = 2.50,   X   = 6.23,   p   = 0.01), suggesting hypo-activation in this region was task-relevant to performance. EXT was also a negative predictor of BOLD activation in the right superior temporal gyrus (Supplementary Table 3). Among individual epochs, EXT was positively associated with BOLD activity within the thalamus during the preparatory epoch and had negative relationships with BOLD activation across frontoparietal regions during the response epoch (Supplementary Table 3).   \nGreater externalizing scores are associated with decreased trail-wise BOLD activation in the left middle frontal gyrus (left). This association did not significantly interact with age (right). Shaded regions represent 95 % confidence intervals. Voxelwise threshold p < .005, number of contiguous voxels > 20, p < 0.05 corrected. \n  Fig. 4   \n\nSpecifically among trial-level data, greater INT scores were associated with decreased activity in frontoparietal regions (inferior parietal lobule, precuneus, middle frontal gyrus; Supplementary Table 3) and greater GA scores predicted increased activity in the left precuneus (Supplementary Table 3). \n\n\n#### Risk factor and sociodemographic interactions with age \n  \nAt the trial-level, there was a significant GA and age interaction in the right middle frontal gyrus ( ; Supplementary Fig. 3) such that greater GA scores predicted decreased activity in this region with increasing age. Average activation within this cluster was a positive predictor of antisaccade accuracy (  t   = 2.25,   X   = 5.04,   p   = 0.025). Further, SES interacted with age to predict BOLD activity in the inferior parietal lobule such that greater SES was associated with decreased activity in this region with increasing age ( ; Supplementary Fig. 3).   \nAge interactions of substance use risk and sociodemographic factors in BOLD activation. \n  Table 4     \n\nAt the epoch-level, EXT moderated age-related BOLD activity within the left posterior parietal cortex ( ;  ) in the cue epoch. Mean activation within this cluster did not predict antisaccade accuracy (proportion of correct trials;   t   = 0.46,   X   =0.21,   p   = 0.65) or latency (  t   = 1.24,   X   =15.40,   p   = 0.21). Mirroring similarities with EXT in behavioral data, GA and SES also interacted with age to predict BOLD activation within individual epochs. Specifically, greater GA scores were associated with decreased activation with increasing age in bilateral precuneus in the preparatory epoch but were associated with increased activation with increasing age in the left precuneus and right insula during the response epoch ( ; Supplementary Fig. 4). Greater SES scores were associated with increased activity in the left angular gyrus with increasing age during the cue epoch but decreased activity with increasing age in the left inferior parietal lobule during the preparatory epoch ( ; Supplementary Figs. 5).   \nExternalizing psychopathology (EXT) by age interaction in the left posterior parietal cortex during the cue epoch. Voxelwise threshold p < .005, number of contiguous voxels > 20, p < 0.05 corrected (left). For Johnson-Neyman plot of interaction, darker blue colors reflect significant main effects of EXT (p < 0.05) predicting BOLD signal during the indicated age ranges (right). Shaded regions represent 95 % confidence intervals. \n  Fig. 5   \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between age-related trajectories of inhibitory control and substance use risk factors. Our findings indicate that higher levels of externalizing psychopathology are associated with lower accuracy and shorter latencies in early adolescence that normalized at later ages. Neuroimaging results revealed that externalizing psychopathology was associated with both hypo-activation in the middle frontal gyrus at all ages and age-related increases in posterior parietal cortex activation during early adolescence. \n\n### Substance use risk factors and developmental improvements in inhibitory control \n  \nWe found that greater externalizing scores were associated with lower correct response rates in the antisaccade task. This result is consistent with our previous findings within a subset of the current sample ( ), and supports theories relating disinhibitory phenotypes of substance use risk with poor response inhibition ( ;  ). We further sought to investigate how the relationship between inhibitory control limitations and substance use risk changes developmentally. Consistent with previous work, antisaccade accuracy and latency improved throughout adolescent development ( ). However, our findings indicate divergent developmental trajectories of inhibitory control with respect to the degree of substance use risk factors. Specifically, we show that greater levels of externalizing psychopathology were associated with poorer antisaccade accuracy and shorter latencies in early adolescence. However, secondary analyses revealed a nuanced relationship between latency and accuracy in high externalizing youth during early adolescence, where the largest differences in correct response rate where observed at longer latencies. Thus, these findings do not support a speed accuracy trade-off model of impulsivity in which high impulsivity is associated with rapid and error-prone responses in cognitive tasks ( ). Rather, they may be consistent with differences in an overall response strategy that differentially emphasizes speed or accuracy, depending on task demands. Our results further suggest such response differences are most evident in early adolescence, followed by a pattern of equifinality. However, despite poor response inhibition in early adolescence, high externalizing scores were associated with accelerated age-related improvements in accuracy to establish normative performance levels by late adolescence. Similarly, shorter latencies in early adolescence normalized by late adolescence. These developmental differences may reflect shifts in strategies to optimize performance throughout development and compensate for inhibitory control limitations in early adolescence, as high externalizing youth gain more top-down control of behavior. To this end, additional work may more directly test developmental changes in speed-accuracy trade-offs and decision-making strategies in more explicit computational frameworks (e.g., drift diffusion modeling) in externalizing youth. \n\nAlthough previous work implicates cognitive control deficits in youth with a family history of substance use disorder ( ), this risk factor was not associated with differences in antisaccade performance in the current study. However, our analyses with this risk factor had limited statistical power due to few family history positive subjects within the sample. In contrast, and relatively unexpectedly, internalizing psychopathology was associated with low correct response rate and shorter latencies across development. More clarity on family history and internalizing psychopathology within inhibitory control paradigms will require future work examining broad multidimensional high-risk profiles (see   4.3  ). Nevertheless, externalizing psychopathology was the only substance use risk factor that moderated age-related change in antisaccade performance, providing some support that externalizing psychopathology may be uniquely associated with developmental differences in inhibitory control. To this end, the externalizing by age interaction remained significant when covarying other risk factors, as well as generalized cognitive ability and socioeconomic status. Taken together, these results highlight early adolescence as a potential period of increased substance use vulnerability by way of developmental differences in response inhibition and disinhibitory phenotypes. \n\n\n### Substance use risk factors and brain systems supporting inhibitory control \n  \nConverging with previous research examining prospective prediction of substance use initiation and high-risk profiles, internalizing and externalizing substance use risk factors in the current project were associated with decreased BOLD activation across frontoparietal regions during response inhibition ( ;  ). Further, supporting previous work implicating poor top-down control in externalizing psychopathology ( ), greater levels of externalizing psychopathology were associated with decreased trial-level activation in the left middle frontal gyrus. Given that this finding occurs at the trial-level and activation in this region predicted antisaccade accuracy, poor inhibitory control performance associated with high externalizing may be marked by limitations in broad inhibitory control processes mediated by the middle frontal gyrus. Further, this relationship may represent a general trait-level feature of externalizing psychopathology as it was stable across development. This relationship may also index a trait-level feature of general psychopathology as internalizing psychopathology was also associated with developmentally-stable decreased activation in frontoparietal regions. In contrast to common developmentally-stable effects, externalizing psychopathology was uniquely associated with developmental differences in posterior parietal cortex activity during the cue epoch of the antisaccade task, where high externalizing scores were associated with increasing activation with age in this region. The developmental association of posterior parietal cortex activation with externalizing psychopathology as a substance use risk factor is consistent with previous research showing that posterior parietal cortex activation differences are associated with adolescent substance use ( ) and substance use vulnerability ( ) and age of substance use initiation ( ) during working memory tasks. Although the sign of activation may differ based on task demands, activation differences in the posterior parietal cortex may represent a common developmental neural correlate underlying substance use risk across cognitive tasks. Supporting this, the posterior parietal cortex is implicated in attentional control, a function supporting both working memory and inhibitory control ( ;  ). In addition, previous research has found that trait impulsivity is positively correlated with vulnerability to distraction by reward cues ( ). Therefore, since parietal cortex activation differences related to externalizing psychopathology occurred during the incentive cue epoch, this finding may reflect developmental differences associated with orienting attention to reward contingency cues. \n\nPrevious work characterizing normative functional development of the parietal cortex indicates this region does not exhibit age-related changes during the antisaccade task ( ) but its function decreases with age to support working memory development ( ). Diverging from these patterns, greater levels of externalizing psychopathology were associated with increasing engagement of the posterior parietal cortex across development, which was not observed for low levels of externalizing psychopathology and in more normative subjects (cf.,  ). Given that differences in antisaccade performance associated with externalizing psychopathology are most evident in early adolescence and normalize with age, age-related increases in posterior parietal cortex activation may reflect a compensatory mechanism that serves to optimize performance across development. However, in the absence of a significant association between activity in this region and antisaccade behavioral performance, the functional contribution of parietal cortex activity to developmental differences in inhibitory control performance associated with externalizing psychopathology remains unclear. Future work may employ tasks targeting multiple cognitive functions (e.g., inhibition, attentional control:  ; working memory:  ) to examine general and specific activation patterns in the posterior parietal cortex that may underlie the developmental differences of cognitive control in risk for substance use. \n\n\n### Common and specific neurocognitive profiles of substance use risk factors \n  \nIn addition to characterizing development trajectories associated with substance use risk factors, we investigated developmental differences in broader sociodemographic factors, including generalized cognitive ability accuracy and socioeconomic status. Mirroring developmental differences associated with externalizing psychopathology, lower levels of generalized cognitive ability and socioeconomic status were associated with decreased antisaccade correct response rates in early adolescence that normalized in late adolescence and early adulthood. These results indicate a potential common developmental pattern of equifinality across sociodemographic and psychopathology risk factors. Taken together with previous work characterizing the interrelationships amongst socioeconomic status, executive functioning, and psychopathology ( ;  ), these results support theories suggesting substance use risk may best be represented using dimensional constructs encompassing multiple facets of risk factors (e.g., neurobehavioral disinhibition;  ). However, our results also suggest that each risk factor may be associated with independent developmental processes underlying inhibitory control maturation. Supporting this, differences in age-related improvements in antisaccade   latency   was specific to externalizing psychopathology. Further, generalized cognitive ability, socioeconomic status, and externalizing psychopathology were associated with developmental differences in non-overlapping brain regions. Specifically, greater levels of generalized cognitive ability and socioeconomic status were associated with BOLD activity that decreased with age in the middle frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobules, respectively. Thus, our data indicate potential compensatory mechanisms may be differentially relevant to each risk factor. Future research may further evaluate individual differences in neurocognitive mechanisms underlying developmental patterns of equifinality in inhibitory control common across substance use risk and sociodemographic factors. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe present study is characterized by a number of strengths, including a relatively large longitudinal neuroimaging sample and use of continuous measures of substance use risk factors. This approach allowed us to identify the relative magnitude of substance use risk factors and distinct age ranges in which differences in inhibitory control were most evident. Such a characterization of individual differences in inhibitory control across development and among multiple risk factors highlights the importance of studying dimensional constructs of psychopathology (Research Domain Criteria;  ). However, in the current sample, a relatively small proportion of the sample exceeded the described threshold of alcohol use at baseline and few participants initiated problematic substance use at follow-up visits. This limited our ability to examine how problematic substance use initiation and escalation may perturb normative development of inhibitory control. Similarly, relatively few participants met criteria for a family history of substance use disorder. Therefore, our study was less powered compared to previous studies that have characterized developmental differences in youth with a family history of substance use disorder ( ). With respect to previous work highlighting cognitive control deficits in youth with a family history of substance use disorder ( ) and substance use initiation in adolescence ( ), future research leveraging large-scale initiatives such as the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and broader datasets within the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) will be critical in characterizing developmental differences associated with family history of substance use disorder and subsequent substance use escalation. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur findings indicate that substance use risk factors are associated with developmental differences in inhibitory control. Specifically, externalizing psychopathology was associated with decreased correct response rates and shorter latencies in early adolescence that appear to resolve into adulthood, perhaps through compensatory mechanisms acquired during adolescence. Neuroimaging data reveal high externalizing psychopathology was associated with developmentally-stable hypo-activation in prefrontal cortex and divergent development of posterior parietal cortex activation. Taken together, our data suggest that early adolescence may be a critical developmental period for prevention and intervention strategies addressing cognitive and phenotypic disinhibition. Nevertheless, further research examining multidimensional risk profiles in larger longitudinal datasets is needed to understand neurocognitive developmental mechanisms of problematic substance use onset and resilience across adolescence. Such a detailed understanding of neurodevelopmental factors of substance use vulnerability can clarify outcomes of adolescents with high-risk profiles and the etiology of early and escalating problematic substance use. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis work was supported by the  : U0AA1021690; U01AA021681. \n\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest \n  \nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: tbl0005\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tUnnamed: 1\tBaseline\tSecond Visit\tThird Visit\nN\tN\t94\t79\t47\nFemale (%)\tFemale (%)\t59.57\t53.16\t44.68\nAgea\tAgea\t17.11 (2.66)\t18.46 (2.48)\t19.09 (2.51)\nGeneralized Cognitive Ability (z-score)a, b\tGeneralized Cognitive Ability (z-score)a, b\t\u22120.01 (0.85)\t0.03 (0.87)\t0.25 (0.76)\nSocioeconomic Statusa\tSocioeconomic Statusa\t89.63 (14.11)\t88.41 (15.32)\t91.36 (13.68)\nRace (%)\tCaucasian\t82.98\t82.28\t91.49\nRace (%)\tNon-Caucasian\t17.02\t17.71\t8.51\nSubstance use\tExceeds Threshold Drinkingb (n)\t24\t20\t8\nRisk Factors\tExternalizing T-scorea, c\t42.91 (8.14)\t43.97 (8.71)\t41.49 (8.81)\nRisk Factors\tInternalizing T-scorea, c\t45.02 (9.41)\t45.25 (9.55)\t41.57 (10.36)\nRisk Factors\tFamily history of substance use disorderb (n)\t16\t18\t9\n### Caption\nSample characteristics.\n### Footer\nNote.aMean (standard deviation). bDefined at baseline. cGender and age adjusted.\n\n\n## ID: tbl0010\n### Label: Table 2\nUnnamed: 0\tEXT\tINT\tFH\tETD\tAge\tSES\tGA\tGender\nEXT\t\u2014\tPearson\tPolyserial\tPolyserial\tPearson\tPearson\tPearson\tPolyserial\nINT\t0.517***\t\u2014\tPolyserial\tPolyserial\tPearson\tPearson\tPearson\tPolyserial\nFH\t0.184\t0.134\t\u2014\tPolychoric\tPolyserial\tPolyserial\tPolyserial\tPolychoric\nETD\t0.298**\t0.012\t0.181\t\u2014\tPolyserial\tPolyserial\tPolyserial\tPolyserial\nAge\t0.098\t0.066\t\u22120.005\t0.520***\t\u2014\tPearson\tPearson\tPolyserial\nSES\t\u22120.178*\t\u22120.118\t\u22120.142\t0.067\t0.080\t\u2014\tPearson\tPolyserial\nGA\t0.065\t\u22120.027\t0.078\t0.192\t0.427***\t0.408***\t\u2014\tPolyserial\nGender\t0.007\t\u22120.029\t\u22120.338*\t0.021\t0.129\t\u22120.035\t\u22120.044\t\u2014\n### Caption\nCorrelations amongst risk and sociodemographic factors of interest.\n### Footer\nNote. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.

The underlying neural mechanism of T2DM-induced cognitive impairment (T2DM-CI) remains unclear. This study proposes to identify a small number of dysfunctional brain connections as imaging biomarkers, distinguishing between T2DM-CI, T2DM with normal cognition (T2DM-NC), and healthy controls (HC). We have recruited 22 T2DM-CI patients, 31 T2DM-NC patients, and 39 HCs. The structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and resting state fMRI images are acquired, and neuropsychological tests are carried out. Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) is analyzed to identify impaired brain regions implicated with T2DM and T2DM-CI. The functional network is built and all connections connected to impaired brain regions are selected. Subsequently, L -norm regularized sparse canonical correlation analysis and sparse logistic regression are used to identify discriminative connections and Support Vector Machine is trained to realize three two-category classifications. It is found that single-digit dysfunctional connections predict T2DM and T2DM-CI. For T2DM-CI versus HC, T2DM-NC versus HC, and T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC, the number of connections is 6, 7, and 5 and the area under curve (AUC) can reach 0.912, 0.901, and 0.861, respectively. The dysfunctional connection is mainly related to Default Model Network (DMN) and long-distance links. The strength of identified connections is significantly different among groups and correlated with cognitive assessment score (  p   < 0.05). Via ALFF analysis and further feature selection algorithms, a small number of dysfunctional brain connections can be identified to predict T2DM and T2DM-CI. These connections might be the imaging biomarkers of T2DM-CI and targets of intervention. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDiabetes mellitus is a common metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia ( ). Currently, there are an estimated 463 million adults with diabetes worldwide, of which Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for more than 90% ( ). The chronic hyperglycemia of T2DM patients may cause systemic damage to nerves, eyes, kidneys, and blood vessels, which may bring many complications, such as cognitive impairment (CI), microvascular complications ( ),and olfactory dysfunction ( ). \n\nT2DM-induced cognitive impairment (T2DM-CI), also known as diabetic encephalopathy, mainly manifests through learning, judgment, and memory deficits, a decline in executive function, and decreased information processing speed ( ;  ;  ). Many longitudinal studies have found that T2DM is an independent risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) ( ) and vascular dementia (VD) ( ), and some patients may even deteriorate to severe dementia ( ). However, due to the diversity of clinical manifestations of T2DM-CI and its relatively slow onset, there is no gold standard for diagnosis, which is likely to cause misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis and delay the treatment of patients ( ). \n\nResting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and the subsequent computational analysis have presented the potential of precisely characterizing and inferring neurological diseases, including T2DM-CI ( ;  ). Measures of brain regions and connections are two main aspects of the computational analysis. Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) can reflect the intensity of spontaneous neural activity of each voxel from an energy perspective, thereby reflecting the regularity and physiological state of neuron autonomous activity in different brain regions ( ). It has been demonstrated that T2DM shows the decreased ALFF in frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and posterior cerebellar lobe ( ;  ). ALFF disturbances in the occipital lobe may play an important role in T2DM-related cognitive dysfunction ( ). Most previous studies have only compared T2DM patients with healthy controls (HC), however, T2DM-CI is not well-studied. \n\nThrough various brain atlases [e.g., the recently established human Brainnetome Atlas of 246 brain subregions ( )], a whole brain functional network can be constructed from rs-fMRI data to study the brain connections. This method can fully utilize the rich information from the viewpoint of connectomics, find potential neuroimaging biomarkers, and help people understand the neural mechanism of neurological and psychiatric disorders ( ;  ;  ;  ). Previous studies have shown that T2DM is of aberrant brain functional connectivity ( ;  ). \n\nThrough machine learning, the integrated models of characteristics across multiple brain connections and regions can be constructed to predict clinical statuses and outcomes ( ;  ;  ). Remarkable progress has been made for autism, schizophrenia, depression, and AD ( ;  ;  ;  ). Specifically,   selected 23 connections to identify 38 T2DM-CI from 84 T2DM patients and the resulted area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) reached 0.9737. \n\nBetter predictive biomarkers of T2DM-CI rest on the effective identification of the discriminative features (or connections). Meanwhile, the number of identified connections must be small to avoid the over-fitting problem in which the fitting errors are artificially smaller than inherent data variance ( ;  ). The resulted model with over-fitting inevitably presents catastrophic generalizability for external data. According to a rule of thumb, 10 samples (patients) are usually required for each feature (or connection) in a binary classifier ( ). \n\nTherefore, we propose one effective method of identifying a small number of dysfunctional brain connections and use them as imaging biomarkers to distinguish among T2DM-CI, T2DM with normal cognition (T2DM-NC), and healthy controls (HC). There are three contributary aspects. First, one ALFF-based way is proposed to identify dysfunctional connections through the impaired Brainnetome regions, integrating the information of both brain regions and connections. Second, 6, 7, and 5 dysfunctional connections have been identified as biomarkers distinguishing between T2DM-CI and HC, T2DM-NC and HC, and T2DM-CI and T2DM-NC. The strength of identified connections are significantly different among groups and correlated with cognitive assessment score (  p   < 0.05). Third, the constructed three models can predict T2DM and T2DM-CI with the AUC higher than 0.90. These identified dysfunctional brain connections might direct the underlying neural mechanism of T2DM-CI and the potential targets of intervention of T2DM care. The ALLF-based method can be expanded to study other neurological disorders. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA total of 53 T2DM patients who met the diagnostic criteria were recruited from Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University from January 2015 to January 2017. Inclusion criteria for T2DM patients were that they must: (1) meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes, (2) be 45 to 75 years old, (3) have a history of diagnosis of 5 to 10 years, and (4) be right-handed. Meanwhile 39 healthy people who were examined at Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University at the same time were recruited as the HC group. The sex, age, and education level of the HC group were matched with T2DM patients. Exclusion criteria for all participants were: (1) patients with vision, hearing, language communication, or physical activity difficulties; (2) patients with psychiatric disorders or head trauma; (3) alcoholics, smoking addicts, or drug abusers; (4) MRI contraindications; and (5) patients with brain injury, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, and other brain diseases, and patients with brain white matter demyelination (Age-Related White Matter Changes (ARWMC) score >1). The detailed demographic information of the enrolled subjects is shown in  . This study was approved by the ethics committee of Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University and was in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. All the subjects were informed about the examination, expressed their knowledge of the study, and signed their informed consent. \n  \nDemographic, clinical, and neuropsychological information of the participants. \n    \nWe used neuropsychological tests, including the Chinese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) ( ), clock drawing test (CDT) ( ), auditory verbal learning test (AVLT) ( ), digit span test (DST) ( ), trail making test (TMT) ( ), and verbal fluency test (VFT) ( ), to determine the cognitive status of T2DM patients. The same trained physicians judged whether T2DM patients have cognitive impairment and divided them into T2DM-CI (MoCA score < 26,   n   = 22) and T2DM-NC (MoCA score \u2265 26,   n   = 31). The details are given in  . \n\n\n### Rs-fMRI Data Acquisition \n  \nMRI scanning was performed using one Magnetom 3.0 Tesla scanner (Siemens, Germany) with a 12-channel head phased array surface coil. The gradient field is 45 mT/m, and the gradient switching rate is 200 mT/ms. The subject\u2019s head was fixed with a sponge pad before scanning and was informed to keep their head still during the scan. Structural images were acquired using the standard 3D magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence: repetition time (TR) = 2530 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.22 ms, slice thickness = 1.0 mm, flip angle (FA) = 7\u00b0, field of view (FOV) = 224 \u00d7 224 mm, matrix = 224 \u00d7 224, layers = 192. Rs-fMRI images were collected by the echo planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, slice thickness = 3.5 mm, FA = 90\u00b0, FOV = 224 \u00d7 224 mm, matrix = 64 \u00d7 64, layers = 31. 240 time phases were collected and 240 images were obtained. The MRI images will be available upon reasonable request after approval by the Ethic Committee of Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University. \n\n\n### Overview of the Study Procedure \n  \nAs shown in  , there are seven steps in our study. (1) Image processing is performed according to the standard procedures. (2) ALFF analysis is done to identify the impaired regions for three two-group comparisons. (3) Functional brain network is constructed for each participant. (4) Impaired Brainnetome regions are identified. (5) Dysfunctional connections connected with the impaired Brainnetome are selected. (6) Discriminative connections are identified by L -norm regularized sparse canonical correlation analysis (L -SCCA) and sparse logistic regression (SLR). (7) Classifiers are trained, and their performance is evaluated. \n  \nOverview of study procedure.   (A)   Main steps in this study [It is noted that steps from (2) to (7) are carried out many times since they are included in a procedure of leaving-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) to avoid the leakage of category information];   (B)   Image preprocessing;   (C)   Construction of functional brain network;   (D)   Identification of impaired Brainnetome subregions by ALFF analysis;   (E)   Identification of discriminative connections by L1-SCCA and spare logistic regression (SLR). \n  \nIt is noted that, to avoid category information leakage, steps from (2) to (7) in   are carried out in a procedure of leaving-one-out cross validation (LOOCV). It means that steps from (2) to (7) have be conducted for n1, n2, and n3 times for T2DM-CI versus HC, T2DM-NC versus HC, and T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC, where n1, n2, and n3 are the number of participants in three classifications after step (1) of imaging preprocessing. \n\n\n### Image Preprocessing \n  \nIn this study, resting state fMRI data are preprocessed using Data Processing and Analysis for Brain Imaging (DPABI) toolkit  in MATLAB 2018b software. As shown in  , at first, the initial 10 time points of fMRI data are removed to exclude the influence of the instability of equipment initialization and subjects\u2019 adaptation to the environment. Second, slice-timing correction and realignment for head motion correction are carried out. Three participants with head motion exceeding 2.0 mm maximum translation or 2\u00b0 rotation are excluded. Third, detrending and nuisance covariates regression, including Friston 24-parameter model, and mean time series of global, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid signals as regressors, are conducted to remove the influence of physiological factors. Fourth, spatial normalization is carried out, and the brain structure of each subject is normalized to the standard template by the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) tool ( ). Finally, images are smoothed by Gaussian of full-width at half-maximum 4 mm. Because ALFF analysis is then needed, we have skipped filtering during the preprocessing. It is noted that 89 subjects (19 T2DM-CI, 31 T2DM-NC, and 39 HC) took part in the following study since three subjects were removed during image preprocessing. \n\n\n### ALFF Calculation and Statistical Analysis \n  \nWe used the modules in the DPABI toolkit to calculate ALFF. First, time series of each voxel are transformed into frequency domain by Fourier transform and then the power spectrum is obtained. Subsequently, the square root of each frequency power spectrum is calculated according to the frequency band (usually 0.01\u20130.08 Hz), and the mean value is ALFF. Finally, the ALFF values are standardized to reduce the errors caused by individual differences. The standardized ALFF value is the ALFF value of each voxel divided by the whole brain ALFF mean value. \n\nWe have performed statistical analysis on the standardized ALFF values of T2DM-CI, T2DM-NC, and HC. The ALFF values among the three groups are compared by one-way ANOVA test and the statistical map with significant difference is used to create a mask. Then two-sample   t  -tests are performed as   post hoc   tests to identify regions with significant differences in the mask above. The significance level of two-sample   t  -tests are set at   p   < 0.05 with 1000 permutations corrected with the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) correction. It is found that permutations corrected with the TFCE correction can best balance the family-wise error (FWE) rate and test-retest reliability ( ). \n\nTo avoid the category information leakage, ANOVA test and two-sample   t  -test are carried out after leaving one out, not for all subjects. Specifically, in each fold of the leave-one-out procedure, we have conducted the above ANOVA test and two-sample   t  -test on all subjects except the one who is taken out, then we get the regions with significantly different ALFF of this fold. They are named the impaired regions. In summary, this step of ALFF calculation and statistical analysis has been conducted 58 times for T2DM-CI versus HC, 70 times for T2DM-NC versus HC, and 50 times for T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC. \n\n\n### Construction of Functional Brain Networks \n  \nThe network consists of many nodes and edges between those nodes. In the functional brain network, nodes represent brain regions and edges represent the degree of statistical dependence of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) imaging between different brain regions. As shown in  , the present study has used the Human Brainnetome Atlas ( ), which parcellates the whole human brain into 246 subregions, and each subregion represents a node in the brain network. With the progress of MRI scanning, changes in activity of different brain regions can be reflected as time courses. For each subject, we obtain the average time courses of the 246 brain subregions and then we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the average time courses of any two subregions as a functional connectivity indicator between them, which can be used as the edge of the brain network. After that, we can get one 246 \u00d7 246 adjacency matrix of each subject, which is called the weighted functional connectivity matrix. \n\n\n### Identification of Impaired Brainnetome Subregions \n  \nAfter using two-sample   t  -test of ALFF to determine voxels with significant differences between two groups, we excluded clusters with less than 20 voxels. Spatially matching the impaired regions identified by ALFF analysis with Brainnetome Atlas can determine the volume of the impaired region in each Brainnetome subregions. We sort the Brainnetome subregions by volume of impaired region from large to small. Finally, two lists of subregions with increased and decreased ALFF are obtained for each two-group comparison. \n\nPrevious studies have reported that, compared with HCs, T2DM patients have decreased ALFF values in brain regions which are related to cognitive impairment. There are 15 Brainnetome subregions with decreased ALFF for both T2DM-CI versus HC and T2DM-NC versus HC, which are named as the impaired Brainnetome subregions. For T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC, there are only 10 subregions with decreased ALFF. In order to get the same number of subregions for the three groups, we have added five subregions with increased ALFF. \n\n\n### Identification of Connections With High Discriminative Power \n  \nIn constructed adjacency matrix, all functional connections connected to the 15 impaired Brainnetome subregions are considered to be potentially discriminative. \n\nThe number of features is still too large for classification. We utilize a combination of L -SCCA and SLR to further perform dimension reduction ( ). At first, we have two data matrices: the first data matrix of   and the second matrix of   . X  lists the attributes all subjects with a dimension of   N   \u00d7   p   (  N   is the number of subjects,   p   is 3 here). The first column of X  is the \u201cDiagnosis\u201d label (either 0 or 1), while the second and third columns are the age and gender (1 for male, 0 for female). X  lists the connections connected with 15 impaired Brainnetome subregions with a dimension of   N   \u00d7   p   (  p   is 3570 here). L -SCCA is applied to get the sparse projection matrices V  and V  from X  and X . As the equation given in references ( ;  ), for a canonical variable, L -SCCA is formulated as, \n\nwhere v  and v  are the projection vectors and \u03bb  and \u03bb  are their sparseness, respectively. Subsequently, the canonical variable only associated with the \u201cDiagnosis\u201d label is determined, the connections corresponding to the diagnostic canonical variable is chosen, and the effect of nuisance variables of age and gender is reduced. \n\nSparse logistic regression is further used to reduce the dimension of features and identify the connections with high discriminative power. Given   N   feature-label data samples {(  x  ,  y  ),\u2026,(  x  ,  y  )}, LR aims to find the parameter vector \u03b8 such that the likelihood function   l  (\u03b8) is maximized. \n\nwhere, \n\nhere  ,   D   is the dimension of features and \u03b8  is the bias. \n\nSparse logistic regression combines the automatic relevance determination (ARD) with LR ( ). Imposing the constraint on the weight parameter, ARD assumes that each parameter \u03b8  has a Gaussian prior with mean 0. \n\nhere \u03b1  is the inverse variance of the normal distribution and it is treated as a hyper-parameter, named \u201cthe relevance parameter.\u201d \u03b1  regulates the range of \u03b8 . It is known that most \u03b1  diverges to infinity and the corresponding \u03b8  is pruned. Finally, the connections related to the label are automatically selected by SLR. \n\nAfter this reduction, an average of 15.47 connections remain. However, these surviving connections are still too many for the sample in this study and result in over-fitting. Therefore, we instigate the influence of surviving connections on the classification performance and determine the final discriminative connections when the highest performance reaches this point. \n\n\n### Classification and Performance Evaluation \n  \nSupport vector machine (SVM) is used to build prediction models. This study has used the library for support vector machines (LIBSVM) toolkit , which integrates functions such as SVM kernel selection, parameter adjustment, and prediction. We chose the radial basis function (RBF) as the kernel function of the SVM, and the values of the optimal penalty coefficient   C   and the kernel function parameter   Gamma   are determined by the grid search method through 5-fold cross validation. \n\nDue to the limited number of samples in this study, we have used LOOCV to estimate the generalization of the classifier. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under ROC curve (AUC), and the confusion matrix are used to quantify the performance of the classifier. Moreover, using the fixed discriminative connections identified in this study as the features, three SVM models are trained and evaluated by LOOCV. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Impaired Brainnetome Subregions Determined by ALFF \n  \nThrough ALFF analysis and subsequent matching, 15 impaired subregions have been identified for T2DM-CI versus HC, T2DM-NC versus HC, and T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC (  and  ). In  , the abbreviation of brain subregion is used, and one can refer to the original paper for the full names ( ). \n  \nImpaired brain subregions identified through ALFF analysis in T2DM-CI versus HC, T2DM-NC versus HC, and T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC. \n      \nImpaired Brainnetome subregions determined by ALFF.   (A)   T2DM-CI versus HC;   (B)   T2DM-NC versus HC;   (C)   T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC. \n  \nUsing T2DM-CI versus HC as an example, we have conducted the group comparison (or ALFF analysis) 58 times in LOOCV loop. During these 58 comparisons, only one sample (or patient) is different between any two comparisons. Some clusters of voxels with significantly different ALFF will be obtained and there is only a slight difference (a several of voxels) between the \u201cimpaired regions\u201d of any two comparisons. However, this slight difference has been eliminated in the impaired Brainnetome subregions. It is because these Brainnetome subregions are selected if they overlap with the \u201cimpaired regions\u201d and the overlap status does not change with the slight variation of \u201cimpaired regions.\u201d We have compared the identified subregions in 58 experiments of LOOCV loop for T2DM-CI versus HC and found they are completely the same. It is also true for the other two comparisons. \n\nFor T2DM-CI versus HC, two impaired subregions are in the frontal lobe, four in the inferior parietal lobule, three in the precuneus, four in the cingulate gyrus, and two in the occipital lobe. For T2DM-NC versus HC, there is the same spatial distribution as for T2DM-CI versus HC. \n\nTwo subregions in the middle frontal gyrus belong to the executive control network (ECN), four in the inferior parietal, four in the cingulate gyrus, and three in the precuneus are in the default model network (DMN). Two in the occipital lobe belong to the visual network (VN). Among 15 subregions, 13 are overlapped between T2DM-CI versus HC and T2DM-NC versus HC, indicating that T2DM-CI and T2DM-NC have a common neuropathological basis. \n\nFor T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC, three subregions are in the frontal lobe, one in the superior parietal lobule, four in the inferior parietal lobule, one in the postcentral gyrus, four in the precuneus, one in the cingulate gyrus, and one in the occipital lobe. Among 15 subregions, seven have appeared in the above two comparisons and they belong to DMN and ECN. One subregion in the superior parietal lobule and one in the postcentral gyrus are the new ones which do not appear in the other comparisons. From the viewpoint of intrinsic brain network, three subregions (ID: 16, 17, 18) are in ECN, nine in DMN (ID: 136, 138, 142, 144, 151, 152, 153, 154, 183), one in FPN (ID: 132), 1 in DAN (ID: 161), and one in VN (ID: 210). \n\n\n### Dysfunctional Connections With High Discriminative Power \n  \nThe effect of the number of discriminative connections on prediction accuracy is given in  . It is shown that the SVM model has the highest accuracy of 93.1%, while six discriminative connections remain for T2DM-CI versus HC. For T2DM-NC versus HC and T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC, the optimal number of discriminative connections is seven and five. The feature selection method of L1-SCCA and SLR is much better than the dimension reduction of principal component analysis (PCA). \n  \nThe effect of the number of discriminative connections on prediction accuracy and comparison of our method with feature reduction of principle component analysis (PCA).   (A)   T2DM-CI versus HC;   (B)   T2DM-NC versus HC;   (C)   T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC. \n  \nBecause LOOCV is used to divide the dataset, the surviving connections for each fold are slightly different. Sorting the connections by repeat times, the top six, top seven, and top five connections are listed in  \u2013  for T2DM-CI versus HC, T2DM-NC versus HC, and T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC, respectively. The spatial locations of the identified connections are given in  . The straight-line distance between two endpoints of each connection is also calculated according to the MNI coordinates of the subregions and presented in  \u2013 . \n  \nSix discriminative functional connections for T2DM-CI versus HC. \n      \nSeven discriminative functional connections for T2DM-NC versus HC. \n      \nFive discriminative functional connections for T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC. \n      \nDysfunctional connections with high discriminative power.   (A)   Six connections for T2DM-CI versus HC;   (B)   Seven connections for T2DM-NC versus HC;   (C)   Five connections for T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC. The blue lines represent connections used for classification. Dots represent brain subregion nodes connected to these connections. Different colored dots represent subregions from different resting state network. The green dots indicate subregions of DMN, the red dots indicate subregions of FPN, yellow dots indicate subregions of ECN, purple dots indicate subregions of SAN and black dots indicate subregions of DAN. \n  \nIt is found that for T2DM-CI versus HC, among the six selected connections ( ,  ), two are between regions within DMN (left and right subregions in cingulate gyrus; two subregions in cingulate gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus), two between DMN and frontoparietal network (FPN), one between DMN and ECN, and one between DMN and salience network (SAN). DMN appears in all six connections. All six connections are long-distance links across different lobes; three of the six are inter-hemispheric, and the other three are right intra-hemispheric. Though the straight-line distance between subregions of 181 and 182 is only 19.29 mm, it has been treated as a \u201clong-distance\u201d link as it is inter-hemispheric. No left intra-hemispheric connection is observed. For the three inter-hemispheric connections, one subregion in the precuneus (ID: 154, Pcun_R_4_4) appears twice. \n\nFor T2DM-NC versus HC, among the seven selected connections (  and  ), there were two between regions of DMN, two between DMN and ECN, one between ECN and dorsal attention network (DAN), one between DMN and FPN, and one between DMN and SAN. Among the seven connections, two are left intra-hemispheric, two are inter-hemispheric, and three are right intra-hemispheric. All seven connections are long-distance links. The connection between subregions of 175 and 176 is inter-hemispheric, though the straight-line distance is only 8.31 mm. \n\nWhen comparing T2DM-CI versus HC and T2DM-NC versus HC, it is surprising to find that no overlap exists between the six and seven connections although DMN, FPN, ECN, and SAN are involved in both cases. It indicates that the neuropathological substrate for T2DM-CI and T2DM-NC might be different from the viewpoint of functional connections, though they have almost the same impaired subregions ( ). This finding may emphasize that the information of brain regions and connections are intrinsically different and complementary. \n\nFor T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC, among the five selected connections ( ,  ), there are three between DMN and ECN, one between subregions within the DMN, and one between DMN and FPN. Three connections are with the subregion of IPL_R_6_5 in the inferior parietals lobule. Three are inter-hemispheric connections. All five connections are long-distance links across different lobes, suggesting that the global integration of information, not the local communication, might be abnormal in T2DM-induced cognitive impairment. The hippocampus and thalamus are new regions which do not appear in T2DM-CI versus HC and T2DM-NC versus HC. \n\n\n### Altered Strength of Discriminative Connections \n  \nThe strength of discriminative connections is compared between different groups ( ). All discriminative connections have significantly different strengths (  p   < 0.05). Here we define that the smaller connectivity indicates a more negative strength of connection and the greater connectivity indicates a more positive. As shown in  , T2DM-CI shows the smaller connectivity in one connection (181-182) but the greater connectivity in five connections than HC. Most discriminative connections are \u201cweak.\u201d Specifically, only one connection has a strength higher than 0.6 and the other five have strength less than 0.4. \n  \nStrength comparison of dysfunctional discriminative connections.   (A)   Six connections for T2DM-CI versus HC;   (B)   Seven connections for T2DM-NC versus HC;   (C)   Five connections for T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC. * indicates a difference of   p   < 0.05, which is statistically significant. \n  \nFor T2DM-NC versus HC, one connection has strength higher than 0.8 and the other six have strength less than 0.3. Three connections have greater connectivity in T2DM-NC than HC (26-110; 71-181; 15-160) and the other four show the opposite results. \n\nFor T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC, all five discriminative connections are \u201cweak\u201d and with an absolute strength less than 0.3. Three connections in T2DM-CI show smaller connectivity than T2DM-NC (18-237; 37-151; 144-217), but two show the greater connectivity. \n\n\n### Strength of Discriminative Connections and MoCA Score \n  \nThe correlations between the real value of five discriminative connections and MoCA score are analyzed and the correlation coefficients (  r  ) and   p  -values are listed in  \u2013  for three comparisons. For T2DM-CI versus HC, the strength of all six connections is significantly correlated with MoCA score. The first connection (181-182) has positive   r   of 0.3247, corresponding to the one with the smaller connectivity in T2DM-CI, and the others have negative   r  . As expected, there are no significant correlations between the strength of discriminative connections and MoCA score for T2DM-NC versus HC because they have a similar MoCA score >26. \n\nFor T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC, the correlations between the real value of five discriminative connections and MoCA score are given in  . It is found that they are significantly correlated (  p   < 0.05) and the correlation coefficient (  r  ) is \u22120.4273, 0.3831, 0.3862, 0.3555, and \u22120.3527. For the connection between the inferior frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule, the value is positive in T2DM-CI but negative in T2DM-NC (ID: 32 and 144). The same trend occurs for the connection between the superior temporal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule (ID: 133 and 144). The opposite trend appears for the other three connections: middle frontal gyrus and Thalamus (ID: 18 and 237); inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus (ID: 37 and 151); and inferior parietal lobule and hippocampus (ID: 144 and 217). \n  \nCorrelations between the dysfunctional discriminative connections and MoCA scores for T2DM-CI and T2DM-NC groups.   (A)   Connection 32-144;   (B)   Connection 18-237;   (C)   Connection 37-151;   (D)   Connection 144-217;   (E)   Connection 133-144. \n  \nWe have analyzed the correlations between the strength of five discriminative connections in T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC and CDT, AVLT, DST, TMT, VFT, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient (  r  ) and the   p  -values are calculated. Only three cases are significant (  p   < 0.05): Connection 32-144 and CDT (  r   = \u22120.3137); Connection 18-237 and DST (  r   = 0.3191); and Connection 144-217 and CDT (  r   = 0.2894). Since the five discriminative connections are determined according to the classification label given by the MoCA threshold, their strength is significantly correlated with MoCA ( ). However, only three of 25 cases are significant for the five neuropsychological test scales of CDT, AVLT, DST, TMT, and VFT. A possible reason might be that these scales measure different aspects of the neuropsychology or cognition of T2DM patients. \n\n\n### Performance of Predictive Models \n  \nAs shown in  , for T2DM-CI versus HC, the optimal SVM models achieve an average accuracy of 93.1% and an AUC of 0.912 in the LOOCV loop. The precision, F1-score, recall, and specificity are 94.1, 88.9, 84.2, and 97.4%, respectively ( . \n  \nThe ROC curve and confusion matrix obtained by LOOCV procedure.

The precision, F1-score, recall, and specificity are 84.8, 87.5, 90.3, and 87.2%, respectively. The performance is slightly lower than the models for T2DM-CI versus HC. \n\nFor T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC ( ), the optimal SVM models achieve an average accuracy of 76.0% and an AUC of 0.861. However, the recall and F1-score are lower and only reach 62.5 and 52.6%, respectively. Of the nineteen patients with T2DM-CI, nine are wrongly predicted as T2DM-NC. \n\nWhen using the fixed discriminative connection as input features, the performance of SVM models can be improved. As shown in  , the AUC can be increased to 0.977, 0.929, and 0.927 for T2DM-CI versus HC, T2DM-NC versus HC, and T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC, respectively. Especially for T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC, the recall and F1-score can reach 78.9 and 83.3%, respectively, although four patients with T2DM-CI are still predicted wrongly. \n  \nThe ROC curve and confusion matrix obtained by fixed discriminative connections.

As small as six, seven, and five identified connections can lead to reliable SVM classifiers and the prediction accuracy can reach 96.6, 90.0, and 88.0% for T2DM-CI (  n   = 19) versus HC (  n   = 39), T2DM-NC (  n   = 31) versus HC (  n   = 39), and T2DM-CI (  n   = 19) versus T2DM-NC (  n   = 31), respectively. The small number of connections alleviates the over-fitting problem. The proposed new way of identifying connections starts from ALFF analysis to find impaired Brainnetome subregions, further selects discriminative connections from ones linked with impaired subregions by L1-SCCA and SLR, and determines the final connections through investigating the effect of the number of connections on prediction accuracy. \n\n### Impaired Brainnetome Subregions for ALFF \n  \nCompared with the HC group, the 15 impaired Brainnetome subregions with decreased ALFF in the two T2DM groups (T2DM-CI and T2DM-NC) are mostly the same, located in the frontal lobe, inferior parietal lobule, precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and occipital lobe. This finding is in line with previous studies. The frontal lobe is involved in cognitive functions such as execution function, attention, memory, and language ( ); the precuneus is related to many high-level cognitive functions, such as episodic memory, self-related information processing, and self-awareness ( ). The decreased activity in the occipital lobe is significantly correlated with visual memory decline, information processing speed loss, and attention loss. In addition, a relevant study has reported that the hypometabolism and neural degeneration in the posterior cingulate cortex are related to cognitive decline in AD, schizophrenia, and other brain diseases ( ). Zhou et al. concluded that the inferior parietal lobule, including the angular gyrus and the supramarginal gyrus, is involved in higher cognitive function activities, especially executive control functions ( ). The decreased ALFF reflects the inhibition of neurons in related brain regions and the decrease of activity ( ). \n\nFor T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC, 12 subregions belong to DMN and ECN and the other three belong to FPN, DAN, and VN. These regions appear in AD, mild cognitive impairment, and schizophrenia, and are thought be implicated with cognition ( ;  ). In summary, the identified Brainnetome subregions are impaired from the viewpoint of ALFF (i.e., the intensity of spontaneous neural activity) and might help understand the neuropathological basis of T2DM and T2DM-CI. \n\n\n### Discriminative Connections Are DMN-Related and Long-Distance \n  \nFor three classifications, the identified brain connections with high discriminative power are mainly between subregions within DMN and between DMN and other resting state networks including ECN, FPN, and SAN. It is no wonder that DMN are implicated with T2DM and T2DM-CI ( ;  ). DMN is related to continuous thinking, imagination, and internal mental activities such as memory, theory of mind, and self-thinking ( ). In addition, DMN is considered to be related to human cognitive function ( ), and some studies have also found that abnormal activity in the DMN is closely related to some psychiatric disorders, such as MCI ( ), AD ( ) and schizophrenia ( ). \n\nIn T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC, it is found that most of the discriminative connections are between DMN and other resting state networks. ECN is involved in goal-oriented advanced cognitive tasks and plays an important role in adaptive cognitive control ( ). FPN is related to interoceptive awareness, working memory, and emotional regulation ( ), and studies have found that the destruction of FPN and DMN is the basis of metacognitive deficits ( ). Combining the functions of these networks, previous research, and the findings found in this study, we speculated that the cognitive impairment caused by T2DM may be mainly related to the abnormal connectivity patterns between DMN and ECN, FPN, or other resting state networks. \n\nAnother finding is that all discriminative connections for three classifications are long-distance. It is in agreement with the report of T2DM-CI ( ). One possible reason is that the impaired subregions are hub nodes in the brain network and they mediate the long-distance connections between brain modules ( ). The hubs are generally implicated in different brain disorders. These long-distance connections are functionally valuable for information integration and are closely related with cognition ( ;  ). \n\n\n### The Methodology From Brain Regions to Connections \n  \nHere we have proposed one way of identifying discriminative connection for the diagnosis prediction of T2DM and T2DM-CI. It belongs to the category of \u201cFrom brain regions to connections\u201d and the measure of brain regions is ALFF. Our previous study used prior knowledge to localize the etiological origin of depression (lateral habenula, LHb), selected discriminate connections linked with LHb, and realized an accurate prediction of subclinical depression ( ). This method is also in the category of \u201cFrom brain regions to connections.\u201d Moreover, the measure of brain regions can be certainly expanded to other fMRI measures, including regional homogeneity (ReHo) and Voxel-mirrored Homotopic Connectivity (VMHC). \n\nThe identified Brainnetome subregions help narrow the search range of discriminative connections. More importantly, the impaired Brainnetome subregions will leave \u201cALFF memory\u201d to the discriminative connections so that the final classification has used valuable information of both brain region and connections. We observed that among 15 impaired subregions, 13 are overlapped between T2DM-CI versus HC and T2DM-NC versus HC. However, no overlap exists between the six and seven discriminative connections. This observation suggests that the information of brain regions and connections are intrinsically different and complementary. \n\nAnother category of identifying discriminative connections is \u201cSelect connections from network directly.\u201d The selection method can be L1-SCCA, SLR, elastic net, and so on ( ;  ). These methods emphasize the role of connections and believe the hypothesis of \u201cthe node is determined by its connections.\u201d The third category is \u201cSelect brain regions and connections simultaneously.\u201d The measures of brain regions and connections are treated equally, and the selection or reduction of measures rely on powerful machine leaning algorithms or multiple variable analysis ( ). \n\n\n### Less Is Better for Reliable Biomarkers \n  \nOver-fitting is one of the main issues for neuroimaging-based classifiers of neurological disorders. We have 30135 connection candidates (246 245/2 = 30135), and more if necessary. However, the sample size is only 92 in this study due to the difficulty of recruiting patients. An effective way of identifying discriminative features (or connections) is the key to generating better predictive biomarkers. \n\nLess is better for the reliable biomarkers. In this study, single-digit brain functional connections have been identified and enable prediction of T2DM and T2DM-IC. Specifically, six, seven, and five dysfunctional connections can distinguish between T2DM-CI and HC, T2DM-NC and HC, and T2DM-CI and T2DM-NC, respectively. Each feature (or connection) corresponds to 10 samples (patients) in a binary classifier ( ). Fewer connections can alleviate the problem of over-fitting and increase the generalizability of prediction models. Fewer connections means that the etiological origin of T2DM and T2DM-CI is more specific and potential intervention will be targeted and precise. \n\nIt should be noted that our study aims to identify a small number of dysfunctional brain connections as imaging biomarkers distinguishing between T2DM-CI, T2DM-NC, and HC. These identified dysfunctional brain connections may help to understand the underlying neural mechanism of T2DM-CI and even find targets of intervention. However, for real clinical diagnosis and intervention, more studies are required. For clinical diagnosis of T2DM-CI, a reasonable way might be to conduct the cognitive assessment from the clinic at first to find the high-risk group and then to do an fMRI scan. \n\n\n### Limitations and Future Directions \n  \nThere are many limitations in the current study. The sample size is still small, although the total number has reached 92. Moreover, the generalizability of the classifier is not tested on an independent validation cohort since all participants are recruited from one single center. However, the results of this study have confirmed the potential of functional connectivity patterns based on ALFF results to predict cognitive impairment in T2DM patients. In the future, more effective prediction models may be obtained through larger sample data combined with data from different sources. \n\nIn terms of the construction of the prediction model, for the time being, only the combination of L -SCCA and sparse logistic regression are used to reduce the dimension of selected features. In the future, we can use elastic net model, minimum-redundancy maximum relevancy, recursive feature elimination, and other feature selection and dimension reduction methods to obtain a better classification model ( ). \n\nIn this study, T2DM patients have been divided into T2DM-CI and T2DM-NC according to neuropsychological tests. However, because T2DM patients may suffer from diabetic microangiopathy, diabetic retinopathy, and other complications, these diseases may also affect ALFF and functional connectivity. In future research, it may be necessary to consider the impact of other T2DM complications and analyze the potential impact of factors such as the course of T2DM patients and the degree of cognitive impairment ( ). \n\nFinally, this study mainly analyzed from the perspective of brain functional connection network through fMRI data. In the future research, we can combine more neuroimaging data to find abnormalities caused by T2DM-induced cognitive impairment from structural abnormalities as a comprehensive biomarker, so as to make a more reliable analysis and diagnosis of the disease ( ;  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn this study, via ALFF analysis and effective algorithms of feature selection, single-digit dysfunctional brain connections have been identified to predict T2DM and T2DM-induced CI. Only using six, seven, and five discriminative connections, the trained SVM models can realize the classification between T2DM-CI and HC, T2DM-NC and HC, and T2DM-CI and T2DM-NC, with an AUC of 0.912, 0.901, and 0.861, respectively. The strength of identified connections were significantly different among groups and correlated with cognitive assessment (MoCA) score. The impaired Connectome subregions and dysfunctional connections might serve as the imaging biomarkers of T2DM-CI and as potential targets of intervention of T2DM care. The developed method leaves \u201cALFF memory\u201d to the discriminative connections so that the final classification has used valuable information from both brain regions and connections, which can be expanded to studies of other neurological disorders. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe MRI images will be available upon reasonable request after approval by the Ethic Committee of Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University.

Furthermore, it is uncertain whether the amygdala responds in a modality-general fashion or whether modality-specific idiosyncrasies exist. Therefore, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study systematically investigated amygdalar responding to stimulus valence and arousal of emotional expressions across visual and auditory modalities. During scanning, participants performed a gender judgment task while prosodic and facial emotional expressions were presented. The stimuli varied in stimulus valence and arousal by including neutral, happy and angry expressions of high and low emotional intensity. Results demonstrate amygdalar activation as a function of stimulus arousal and accordingly associated emotional intensity regardless of stimulus valence. Furthermore, arousal-driven amygdalar responding did not depend on the visual and auditory modalities of emotional expressions. Thus, the current results are consistent with the notion that the amygdala codes general stimulus relevance across visual and auditory modalities irrespective of valence. In addition, whole brain analyses revealed that effects in visual and auditory areas were driven mainly by high intense emotional facial and vocal stimuli, respectively, suggesting modality-specific representations of emotional expressions in auditory and visual cortices. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIt has been suggested that the amygdala classifies sensory input according to its emotional and motivational relevance  and modulates ongoing sensory processing leading to enhanced representations of emotionally relevant stimuli . Social signals, such as emotional vocal and facial expressions, typically represent environmental aspects of high social and personal relevance (e.g., indicating other persons\u2019 intentions or pointing towards relevant environmental changes) and high intense expressions are associated with higher arousal ratings as compared to low intense expressions . It has been shown that the amygdala responds to both emotional vocal  and facial expressions . However, despite a large body of imaging studies on this issue, previous research does not provide an unequivocal answer regarding the factors that drive amygdalar responses to emotionally expressive voices and faces. Particularly, the specificity of amygdalar responding, that is, the proneness to respond to negative, threat-related emotional information has been a matter of debate . Furthermore, it is uncertain whether emotional signals from different sensory domains are processed in an analogous fashion or whether modality-specific idiosyncrasies exist . \n\nRegarding the mentioned specificity of amygdalar activation to negative as compared to positive stimuli, findings have been mixed. Several studies employing emotional facial expressions suggest a heightened sensitivity for negative stimuli, threat-related stimuli in particular . Unfortunately, most of these studies do not clarify, whether this \u2018threat-sensitivity\u2019 reflects effects of stimulus valence and/or stimulus arousal . Several studies indicate that the amygdala is sensitive to positive and negative stimuli  and might code general effects of motivational relevance and, therefore general arousal, irrespective of valence . With regard to facial expressions, enhanced amygdalar activation has been observed for various types of facial expressions, including happy and surprised faces . Previous research from our own lab provides evidence for amygdalar modulation as a function of stimulus arousal irrespective of stimulus valence by using positive and negative expressions of varying emotional intensity . Here, intensity refers to the entirety of aspects, constitutive for the emotional experience as a whole  and is highly correlated with emotional arousal . Interestingly, some other studies also report modulation by expression intensity (and corresponding stimulus arousal), but report inverse intensity effects (that is, enhanced amygdalar activation to low intense/low arousing expressions  (see discussion below). \n\nWith regard to affective voice processing, findings are also mixed. Using verbal and non-verbal vocalizations some studies show valence specific (e.g., responding to anger, fear, disgust but not happy vocalizations) amygdalar responses , while others indicate valence-independent enhancements reflecting stimulus arousal  or combined effects of stimulus valence and stimulus arousal . In general, many studies only provide a dichotomous experimental manipulation (e.g., neutral versus negative expressions) and do therefore not provide information regarding separate contributions of stimulus valence and stimulus arousal . \n\nWith respect to potential parallels between the processing of emotional vocalizations and facial expressions, it remains uncertain, whether the amygdala responds in a domain-general way across visual and auditory modalities. Recent reviews suggest that the amygdala is more important in affective face processing, as compared to the processing of emotional vocalizations . On the other hand, a large number of imaging studies demonstrate enhanced amygdalar activation to emotional signals from the auditory compared to the visual domain . In a similar vein, lesion studies also report impaired processing of emotional prosody in amygdala-lesioned patients . Finally, there are some bimodal studies, which suggest analogous response patterns irrespective of the visual and auditory domains . Aub\u00e9 and colleagues (2015) , for instance, demonstrate enhanced amygdalar activation in response to fear-related facial expressions, vocalizations and music plays, thus indicating parallels in the processing of emotional signals from different modalities . Taken together, previous studies indicate that the amygdala responds to emotional signals from visual and auditory channels, although it is uncertain whether asymmetries in affective voice and face processing exist. \n\nSeveral aspects might be relevant with regard to the heterogeneous findings of previous research. In particular, many of the above-mentioned studies neither assessed stimulus valence/arousal, nor controlled for comparable arousal levels across valence categories . Positively-valenced facial expressions and voices may tend to be perceived as less arousing since they are frequently encountered in everyday life . Importantly, several of the above-mentioned studies might have failed to create highly arousing positive signals \u2013 especially those which did not manipulate the intensity of emotional expressions . These issues might reduce the arousal effect of positive expression on amygdalar responding, resulting in observing a valence-related effect or a combined effect of stimulus valence and arousal. In addition, only few studies used bimodal experimental designs including emotional signals from visual and auditory domains , allowing for testing whether modality has an effect. Therefore, it remains uncertain, whether observed discrepancies reflect fundamental asymmetries in affective voice and face processing or methodological differences. \n\nThe present study aimed at systematically investigating the role of stimulus valence and stimulus arousal in the processing of emotional expressions from visual and auditory modalities. More precisely, we were interested in clarifying, whether amygdalar responding to affective voices and faces is driven by stimulus valence, stimulus arousal, or the interaction of both factors. In addition, we aimed to answer the question whether effects depend on the visual and auditory modalities of emotional expressions. In order to circumvent the abovementioned limitations of previous research, we employed stimuli, which provided different levels of emotional intensities for positive and negative expressions and therefore comprised varying levels of stimulus arousal and valence. Stimulus arousal was comparable between negative and positive expressions. In addition, rating data reflecting stimulus valence/arousal were used as parametric predictors, modeling brain activation based on stimulus specific mean arousal or valence ratings, in order to identify brain activation varying on these dimensions. Finally, we used a bimodal design in order to directly test potential domain-specific response patterns within the same experimental framework. Overall, we hypothesized that (1.) amygdalar responses reflect modulation of neuronal activation as a function of stimulus arousal with stronger activation for high arousing/high intense expressions, (2.) potential effects of stimulus arousal and expression intensity do not depend on stimulus valence and (3.) amygdalar responding as a function of stimulus arousal and stimulus intensity is analogous across visual and auditory modalities with no modality-specific idiosyncrasies. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty healthy undergraduate and postgraduate students (19\u201328 years,   M  \u2009=\u200922.30,   SD  \u2009=\u20092.54; 10 females) were recruited from the University of Jena, Germany. Participants were right-handed as determined by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory . All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no participants had a history of neurological or psychiatric disease. The study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of ethical standards in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Jena. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to participation. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nFacial and vocal expressions were selected from our newly developed stimulus sets, the Jena 3D Face Database (J3DFD) and the Person Perception Research Unit \u2013 EmoVoice (PPRU \u2013 EmoVoice), respectively. The J3DFD contains 32 Caucasian individuals showing angry, fearful, sad, disgusted, happy, and surprised expressions at three intensity levels plus neutral expressions . The PPRU \u2013 EmoVoice database consists of twenty-four neutral bisyllabic nouns spoken in angry, fearful, sad, disgusted, happy, and surprised prosody at three intensity levels and a neutral prosody by five females and five males. Stimuli were recorded and digitized through an audio interface with a 44100\u2009Hz sampling rate and 16\u2009bit resolution and utterances were normalized in amplitude. These facial and vocal stimuli had been rated by independent samples of 44 and 50 participants, respectively, with respect to physiological arousal (ranging from 1\u2009=\u2009very low to 9\u2009=\u2009very high) and valence (ranging from 1\u2009=\u2009very unpleasant to 9\u2009=\u2009very pleasant). Emotional expressions were additionally rated with respect to the emotional expression intensity (ranging from 1\u2009=\u2009very low to 7\u2009=\u2009very high). \n\nFor the present study, we selected 50 facial and 50 vocal stimuli. Facial stimuli portrayed ten identities (5 females, 5 males) showing angry and happy expressions at high and low intensity levels plus neutral expressions. Vocal stimuli contained ten nouns spoken by 5 females and 5 males in angry, happy, and neutral prosodies, matched of stimulus duration per emotional category (mean: 658\u2009ms, range: 415\u2009ms \u2212 917\u2009ms,   F   (4, 45)\u2009=\u20090.84,   p  \u2009=\u20090.509, partial   \u03b7\u00b2  \u2009=\u20090.07). Mean ratings of emotional valence, arousal and intensity for facial and vocal stimuli are shown in Table\u00a0 . For arousal ratings, ANOVA analysis revealed no significant main effect of expression (  F   (4, 90)\u2009=\u20095.90,   p  \u2009=\u20090.057, partial   \u03b7\u00b2  \u2009=\u20090.86) or modality (  F   (1, 90)\u2009=\u20092.72,   p  \u2009=\u20090.175, partial   \u03b7\u00b2  \u2009=\u20090.41) but an interaction effect between expression and modality (  F   (4, 90)\u2009=\u200910.91,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, partial   \u03b7\u00b2  \u2009=\u20090.34). Regarding valence ratings there was a significant main effect of expression (  F   (4, 90)\u2009=\u20098.83,   p  \u2009<\u20090.029, partial   \u03b7\u00b2  \u2009=\u20090.90) but not modality (  F   (1, 90)\u2009=\u20090.68,   p  \u2009=\u20090.457, partial   \u03b7\u00b2  \u2009=\u20090.15). Moreover, the interaction between expression and modality reached significance (  F   (4, 90)\u2009=\u200912.11,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, partial   \u03b7\u00b2  \u2009=\u20090.35).   \nMean rating data on intensity (1 to 7), arousal (1 to 9) and valence (1 to 9) with respect to facial and vocal stimuli employed in the present study. \n  \n Note  : Values in parentheses represent standard deviations (  SD  ). \n  \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nAuditory stimuli were presented binaurally via headphones that were specifically adapted for the use in the fMRI environment (commander XG MRI audio system, Resonance Technology, Northridge, USA). When presenting auditory stimuli, a blank screen was presented simultaneously. Visual stimuli were shown via a back-projection screen onto an overhead mirror. Scanning was conducted in two runs (run duration 12\u2009min). Overall, we had 10 conditions (2 modalities [faces vs. voices]\u2009\u00d7\u20095 expressions [angry high, angry low, neutral, happy low, happy high]). Each condition was presented in one block (see Fig.\u00a0  for a schematic presentation of the procedure), consisting of ten trials (i.e., each facial/vocal identity [5 females, 5 males, see also the   Stimuli   section] was presented once in a block). The presentation sequence of each identity was randomized across blocks and participants. Each block was presented twice resulting in 20 blocks per run and overall, in 400 trials (5 expressions\u2009\u00d7\u20092 modalities\u2009\u00d7\u200910 identities\u2009\u00d7\u20092 repetitions\u2009\u00d7\u20092 runs). Between each block, there was an 18\u2009second pause. Visual stimuli were presented for 658\u2009ms, while acoustic stimuli were in average presented for 658\u2009ms (see stimulus description) with a stimulus onset asynchrony of 2000 ms. Sequence of blocks were counterbalanced between runs and across participants. Participants were instructed to perform a gender judgment task in order to ensure that participants paid attention to the presented voices and faces. The instructions emphasized both speed and accuracy. Responses were given via button press of the index and the middle finger of the right hand, using a fiber optic response box (LUMItouch; Photon Control). Response assignments to index and middle finger were counterbalanced across participants. Only key pressing during stimulus presentation were considered as valid response. Stimulus presentation and recordings were accomplished by Presentation Software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Albany, California).   \nEach condition was presented in one block, consisting of ten trials. Visual stimuli were presented for 658\u2009ms, while acoustic stimuli were in average presented for 658\u2009ms with a stimulus onset asynchrony of 2000 ms. When presenting auditory stimuli, a blank screen was presented simultaneously. Each block was presented twice resulting in 20 blocks per run. Sequence of blocks were counterbalanced between runs and across participants. Participants were instructed to perform a gender judgment task in order to ensure that participants paid attention to the presented voices and faces. \n  \n\n\n### Behavioral data recording and analysis \n  \nAccuracy and reaction times were analyzed with within-subject repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) with the factors Modality (face and voice) and Expression (angry high, angry low, neutral, happy low, and happy high) using IBM SPSS 22 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Greenhouse-Geisser and Bonferroni corrections were used, if appropriate. Results were regarded as statistically significant for   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. \n\n\n### FMRI data acquisition and analysis \n  \nScanning was performed in a 1.5-Tesla magnetic resonance scanner (Magnetom Vision Plus; Siemens Medical Systems). Following the acquisition of a T1-weighted anatomical scan, two runs of 245 volumes were obtained for each participant using T2*-weighted echo-planar images (TE\u2009=\u200950\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, matrix\u2009=\u2009512\u2009\u00d7\u2009512, field of view\u2009=\u2009200\u2009mm, TR\u2009=\u20092973\u2009ms). Each volume comprised 30 axial slices (thickness\u2009=\u20093\u2009mm, gap\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm, in-plane resolution\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm). The slices were acquired parallel to the line between anterior and posterior commissure with a tilted orientation to reduce susceptibility artifacts in inferior parts of the anterior brain . Before imaging, a shimming procedure was performed to improve field homogeneity. The first four volumes of each run were discarded from analysis to ensure steady-state tissue magnetization. \n\nPreprocessing and analyses were performed using Brain Voyager QX (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, the Netherlands). The volumes were realigned to the first volume to minimize effects of head movements. Further preprocessing comprised spatial (8\u2009mm full-width half-maximum isotropic Gaussian) and temporal (high-pass filter: three cycles per run, linear trend removal) filtering. The anatomical and functional images were co-registered and normalized to the Talairach space. The expected BOLD signal change for each predictor was modelled with a canonical double \u03b3 haemodynamic response function. The GLM was calculated with predictors of interest being the factors Modality (face and voice) and Expression (angry high, angry low, neutral, happy low, and happy high). \n\nValence and arousal effects were investigated using a parametric approach involving balanced contrast weights, which were derived from normative valence and arousal ratings reported in Table\u00a0 . Analysis was conducted for two main contrasts (valence and arousal) and their interaction with modality. For the first main contrast \u2018arousal\u2019, the arousal rating data for faces and voices were used as contrast weights, displaying a u-shaped function with higher values for high intense compared to low intense expression and neutral expressions being at the lowest point of the u-shape. Contrast weights were zero-centered. The second main contrast modeled valence effects by using normative valence ratings for faces and voices (see Table\u00a0 ). This contrast modeled a linear function across expression predictors with positive values for positive valence. The two interaction contrasts of visual and auditory modalities with stimulus arousal or valence respectively were modeled using inverted contrast weights for voices. Interactions of arousal and valence were investigated with the mean-centered product of the mean-centered valance and arousal ratings. This parametric approach was chosen, since rating data reflecting stimulus valence/arousal were regarded as most accurate predictors for expected effects on amygdalar responses. Since contrast weights modelled brain activation separately for both modalities, we also controlled for potential differences across modality conditions. \n\nSince the present study focuses on amygdalar response properties, data analysis was conducted as a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis for the amygdala. Additionally, to make the study more comprehensive, a whole-brain analysis was performed without a priori defined ROIs. The amygdala ROI was defined according to probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps  and contained the superficial group, the basolateral group, and the centromedial group as subregions . Anatomical maps were created using the Anatomy Toolbox in Matlab (MATLAB 2014, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, USA) and transformed into Talairarch space using CBM2TAL . Significant clusters were obtained through cluster-based permutation (CBP) with 1000 permutations. The non-parametric CBP framework was chosen, in order to gain precise false discovery rates with no need of assumptions regarding test-statistic distributions . Voxel-level threshold was set to   p  \u2009<\u20090.005. For each permutation, individual beta maps representing activation patterns in a single experimental condition were randomly assigned without replacement to one of the tested experimental conditions. For example, to test the parametric arousal effect, the five beta maps corresponding to the five expressions were randomly assigned to these five conditions, separately for each subject. This approach is based on the assumption formulated by the null-hypothesis stating that the activation is equal across the five expression within a given subject. Cluster mass was assessed by summing all   t  -values in neighboring significant voxels, where voxels are defined as neighbors if they share a face (i.e. each voxel has six neighbors). Cluster masses larger than the 95% of the permutation distribution were considered as statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \n#### Accuracy \n  \nResults revealed a significant main effect of Expression (  F   (4, 72)\u2009=\u20093.84,   p  \u2009=\u20090.007, partial   \u03b7\u00b2  \u2009=\u20090.18), which was further qualified by a significant two-way interaction between Modality and Expression (  F   (4, 72)\u2009=\u20095.37,   p  \u2009=\u20090.001, partial   \u03b7\u00b2  \u2009=\u20090.23). The main effect expression was significant for both voices (  F  (4, 76)\u2009=\u20095.45,   p  \u2009=\u20090.001, partial   \u03b7\u00b2  \u2009=\u20090.22) and faces (  F  (4, 76)\u2009=\u20093.35,   p  \u2009=\u20090.014, partial   \u03b7\u00b2  \u2009=\u20090.15). Bonferroni corrected post hoc   t  -tests revealed higher accuracy rates for angry high as compared to happy low expressions (  p  \u2009\u2264\u20090.001) for the visual domain and higher accuracy rates for happy low as compared to angry low and neutral expressions (  p\u2019s  \u2009\u2264\u20090.004) for the auditory domain (see Table\u00a0 ). No further contrast reached the Bonferroni corrected level of significance (all   p\u2019  s\u2009>\u20090.05). There was no significant effect of modality (  p  \u2009=\u20090.299).   \nMean accuracy in percent and response times (RTs) in milliseconds for each experimental condition. \n  \n Note  : Values in parentheses represent standard errors (  SE)  . \n  \n\n\n#### Response times \n  \nResults revealed main effects of Modality (  F   (1, 18)\u2009=\u2009114.91,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, partial   \u03b7\u00b2  \u2009=\u20090.87) and Expression (  F   (4, 72)\u2009=\u200910.80,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, partial   \u03b7\u00b2  \u2009=\u20090.38, corrected). These main effects were further analyzed by a significant interaction between those two factors (  F   (4, 72)\u2009=\u20098.48,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, partial   \u03b7\u00b2  \u2009=\u20090.32). The main effect expression was significant for voices (  F  (4, 76)\u2009=\u200912.92,   p  \u2009=\u20090.001, partial   \u03b7\u00b2  \u2009=\u20090.41), but not faces (  F  (4, 76)\u2009=\u20091.91,   p  \u2009=\u20090.118, partial   \u03b7\u00b2  \u2009=\u20090.09). Within the auditory domain, Bonferroni corrected post-hoc t-tests revealed shorter response times for happy low as compared to angry low, angry high, and neutral expressions, and for happy high as compared to angry high expressions (all   p\u2019  s\u2009<\u20090.05). \n\n\n\n### FMRI results \n  \n#### ROI analysis \n  \nFor the arousal contrast vector a significant activation cluster within the right amygdala was revealed, showing responses as a function of stimulus arousal (peak voxel coordinates: x\u2009=\u200925, y\u2009=\u2009\u22124, z\u2009=\u2009\u221210;   t  \u2009=\u20093.39, cluster mass\u2009=\u200918.68,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, CBP corrected, cluster size\u2009=\u20096 voxels or 162\u2009mm , see Fig.\u00a0 ). Importantly, there was no significant interaction between stimulus arousal and modality (  p  \u2009>\u20090.05). Furthermore, there were no significant clusters for the main contrast of valence as well as its interaction with stimulus modality (all   ps  \u2009>\u20090.05).   \nEnhanced activation in the right amygdala (x\u2009=\u200925, y\u2009=\u2009\u22124, z\u2009=\u2009\u221210) as a function of stimulus arousal for visual and auditory stimuli (CBP-corrected statistical map, initial voxel-level threshold   p  \u2009=\u20090.005). Bar plots show parameter estimates for visual (left side), and auditory (right side) stimuli. Parameter estimates refer to the mean cluster value, error bars indicate standard errors. \n  \n\nIn order to additionally analyze whether or not there was an overall interaction between stimulus valence and stimulus arousal independent of modality, we used the mean-centered product of the mean-centered valence and arousal ratings as a contrast vector. There was no single voxel reaching the initial set voxel-level threshold. Finally, we also investigated potentially bimodal responses to valence  by comparing all negative with all other stimuli und all positive with all other stimuli. There were no voxels that survived the voxel threshold. \n\n\n#### Whole brain analysis \n  \nThere were several brain regions, which responded as a function of stimulus arousal, most importantly, mid superior temporal sulcus (STS, including the transversal gyrus), postcentral gyrus, posterior occipital cortex, insula, cingulate gyrus, and parts of the lateral frontal cortex (see Table\u00a0  for a complete listing and Fig.\u00a0  for main clusters).   \nSignificant activations modelled by the parametric arousal effect irrespective of visual and auditory modalities. \n  \n Note  .

Bar plots represent parameter estimates for arousal-driven effects in SMG, mSTS, and FG. Parameter estimates refer to peak voxels, error bars indicate standard errors. \n  \n\nClusters in the mid STS (x\u2009=\u200954, y\u2009=\u2009\u221216, z\u2009=\u20096) reflected modulation by vocal expression, while effects in fusiform gyrus (x\u2009=\u2009\u221239, y\u2009=\u2009\u221240, z\u2009=\u2009\u22128) reflected modulation by facial expression (see Fig.\u00a0 ). Congruently, significant arousal\u2009\u00d7\u2009modality interactions were observed for these and several other brain regions, including supramarginal gyrus and anterior cingulate, indicating either preferred responses to voices or to faces (see Table\u00a0  for a complete listing).   \nSignificant activations modelled by the parametric interaction of arousal and modality. \n  \n Note  .

Furthermore, it was of interest whether or not potential modulation of the amygdala by valence and/or arousal would rely on analogous mechanisms for vocal and facial stimuli. We used voices and faces of varying emotional intensity across stimulus valence categories to examine this question. BOLD responses were modeled based on normative rating data on stimulus valence and arousal. Our results revealed amygdalar responses as a function of stimulus arousal and emotional intensity, crucially, irrespective of stimulus valence. In addition, arousal-driven effects for the amygdala were independent of the visual and auditory modalities of incoming emotional information, but reflected common response patterns across visual and auditory domains. \n\nThe proneness of the amygdala to respond to negative, threatening stimuli has been controversially debated . Although enhanced amygdalar activation to negative, threat-related stimuli has been frequently observed , there are few studies which provide convincing evidence in favor of valence-driven amygdalar responding (but see e.g., Kim   et al  . ). On the other hand, there is strong empirical support for the notion, that positive, negative, and ambiguous stimuli can elicit amygdalar responding, indicating that the amygdala shows general responsiveness to any salient emotional information  and stimuli related to personal goals . The present study adds to this observation indicating that amygdalar responses might code general stimulus relevance irrespective of stimulus valence and threat-relation. \n\nThere is also accumulating evidence that emotional intensity impacts amygdalar responding for several categories of emotional stimuli (e.g., scenes  and odors ). In line with these studies, we find a significant positive relationship between amygdalar activation and stimulus arousal, and thus also a positive relationship between amygdalar activation and emotional intensity of facial expressions. Regarding facial expressions, several other studies found effects of emotional intensity on amygdalar responding , which however varied. Interestingly, Gerber and colleagues  observed inverse intensity effects, that is, enhanced amygdalar responding for weak, possibly ambiguous expressions. It is possible that the amygdala is sensitive to both stimulus intensity (signaling a need for prioritized processing) and stimulus ambiguity (signaling a need for gathering more sensory information), resulting in combined intensity and ambiguity effects . \n\nEven though there are many studies investigating whether amygdalar responses to vocal and facial expressions reflect modulation by stimulus valence or stimulus arousal, findings have been inconsistent so far . Unfortunately, the majority of affective face and voice processing studies neither provide orthogonal manipulations of the two factors, nor include rating data on stimulus valence and arousal (but see e.g., Kim   et al  . ; Lin   et al  . , for exceptions). In contrast to previous research, the present study provided highly arousing negative and positive expressions and systematically varied stimulus arousal and emotional intensity across emotional valence categories. Furthermore, statistical models were directly inferred from rating data on stimulus valence and arousal. Thus, our findings provide strong evidence that amygdalar responses to vocal and facial expressions reflect effects of emotional intensity and associated stimulus arousal and do not depend solely on stimulus valence. \n\nImportantly, the present study also investigated whether amygdalar responses to stimulus arousal and expression intensity depend on the visual and auditory modalities of incoming information. The results of the present study provide evidence that the amygdala responds in an analogous fashion to social signals from visual and auditory modalities. These results are in line with earlier findings by Aub\u00e9 and colleagues , which suggest that the amygdala processes emotional information from different modalities in an analogous fashion. Our findings are also partly in line with the findings of Phillips and colleagues , who found analogous amygdalar responses to fearful voices and faces (with respect to disgusted expressions, however, amygdalar enhancements were only observed for facial expressions). Interestingly, recent reviews proposed asymmetries in affective voice and face processing . It is still uncertain, however, whether these asymmetries reflect minor relevance of subcortical structures in affective voice processing (as suggested by the authors) or methodological differences between the two research fields (e.g., less arousing vocal stimuli, smaller sample sizes, less sensitive statistical approaches in auditory studies). The present study experimentally manipulated stimulus modality as a within-subject factor and provided stimuli of comparable emotional properties across modalities. Controlling for methodological differences, we found parallel amygdalar response patterns for emotionally salient voices and faces. Thus, our results indicate that the amygdala responds in a domain-general fashion to emotional signals across visual and auditory domains with no modality-specific idiosyncrasies. \n\nBesides the amygdala, our results provide evidence for domain-general, arousal-driven effects in several multimodal brain regions including the posterior STS, possibly indicating that these regions play an important role in the processing of stimulus arousal across visual and auditory modalities. A recent study by Lin and colleagues (2016)  showed that stimulus arousal strongly impacts activation of the posterior STS in response to facial expressions. Several researchers proposed that the posterior STS is involved in the representation of facial information, particularly the representation of emotional expressions , and demonstrated coupling with other face processing areas such as the fusiform gyrus . Moreover, parts of the STS have been suggested to be the vocal analogue of the fusiform face processing area , representing vocal features of varying complexity dependent on their emotional significance . In addition, the posterior STS and supramarginal gyrus have been reported to be involved in the integration of audio-visual information and to respond to multiple types of social signals . The results of the present study extend the findings of Lin and colleagues  and indicate arousal-driven modulation of the posterior STS by facial and vocal expressions. \n\nIn addition, modality-specific arousal effects were observed in unimodal primary and secondary cortices, such as the lateral occipital cortex and the medial STS (mSTS), which showed enhanced activation in response to highly arousing faces and voices, respectively. In addition, modality-specific valence effects were also observed in some regions (see Table\u00a0 ), which were primarily driven by visual stimulation, and reflected stronger activation to angry as compared to happy expressions. It is possible that advantages for the visual domain reflect a higher degree of specialization for representations of visual stimuli, in line with the dominance of visual representations in human perception. Mostly, modulation by stimulus valence did not reflect valence effects in isolation, but reflected mixed effects of stimulus valence and stimulus arousal, indicating limited empirical support for the valence model (see also Lindquist   et al  .  for a recent meta-analysis on the plausibility of valence-driven brain responses). \n\nThere are several limitations of the present study. Since fMRI results were based on a 1.5 Tesla scanner, future work should investigate these issues with 3 or even 7 Tesla scanners and potential increased sensitivity for more nuanced effects . We would like to mention that we do not suggest that the amygdala might not also code valence. However, the resolution of most fMRI studies makes it difficult to investigate this question in sufficient detail. Single unit studies provide also evidence for highly overlapping units with valence and arousal responses . Future high resolution studies are needed to investigate the issue of potentially spatially distinct responses in small voxels due to valence, arousal, but also modality and other factors in more detail. Furthermore, the fact that the utilized auditory stimuli have no emotional meaning beyond prosody might be regarded as detrimental for the comparative validity of employed stimuli. Importantly, there are several studies demonstrating that it is rather prosody than meaning that causes an emotional reaction . In addition, it should be noted that both stimulus categories provide affective and \u2013 to a large extend \u2013 non-affective information such as basic visual/auditory features related to gender, age, and identity. Considering these aspects, we regard the parallelism between the employed voices and faces as relatively far-reaching . The present study used one specific negative emotion (i.e. anger) and a specific class of socially relevant stimuli. Thus, in order to ensure the generalizability of our findings to other types of negative expressions and emotional stimuli, the inclusion of a broader range of expressions  and further emotional stimuli (e.g., biological emotional stimuli ) would be highly desirable. Finally, the present study found a valence-independent and modality-independent effect of arousal on amygdalar responding by using an implicit emotion task (e.g., a gender task). However, an explicit emotion task (e.g., an emotion discrimination task) is often used in studies on emotion processing. Furthermore, several studies have manipulated both explicit and implicit tasks to investigate the effect of task on the processing of emotional facial and vocal expressions . Future studies might use both explicit and implicit tasks to investigate whether these tasks will show differential effects on arousal and valence dependent amygdala activations. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nBased on normative rating data on stimulus valence and arousal, the present fMRI study suggest enhanced amygdalar activation as a function of stimulus arousal, which does not depend on stimulus valence. Furthermore, present findings support the hypothesis of the amygdala as common neural substrate in affective voice and face processing, which evaluates emotional relevance irrespective of visual and auditory modalities. Finally, whole brain data provided evidence for modality-specific representations of emotional expressions in auditory and visual cortices, which again, mainly reflected the impact of emotional intensity and associated stimulus arousal. Future high resolution studies, however, should further investigate potential overlapping and distinct activations in the amygdala depending on arousal, valence, stimulus modality and specific task contexts. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tFaces\tFaces\tFaces\tFaces\tFaces\tVoices\tVoices\tVoices\tVoices\tVoices\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tAngry high\tAngry low\tNeutral\tHappy low\tHappy high\tAngry high\tAngry low\tNeutral\tHappy low\tHappy high\nIntensity\t5.60 (0.60)\t3.88 (0.76)\t\t3.83 (0.60)\t6.00 (0.43)\t5.28 (0.66)\t4.97 (0.75)\t\t4.37 (0.74)\t5.19 (0.52)\nArousal\t5.93 (0.50)\t4.48 (0.63)\t2.24 (0.23)\t4.11 (0.57)\t5.85 (0.69)\t4.39 (0.77)\t4.22 (0.57)\t2.64 (0.49)\t3.86 (0.72)\t4.19 (0.73)\nValence\t2.29 (0.40)\t3.21 (0.50)\t5.30 (0.34)\t6.76 (0.55)\t6.58 (0.75)\t3.22 (0.95)\t3.41 (0.52)\t4.96 (0.72)\t5.04 (0.93)\t5.61 (0.63)\n### Caption\nMean rating data on intensity (1 to 7), arousal (1 to 9) and valence (1 to 9) with respect to facial and vocal stimuli employed in the present study.\n### Footer\nNote: Values in parentheses represent standard deviations (SD).\n\n\n## ID: Tab2\n### Label: Table 2\nUnnamed: 0\tUnnamed: 1\tAngry high\tAngry low\tNeutral\tHappy low\tHappy high\nAccuracy\tfaces\t76.38 (2.57)\t73.13 (2.84)\t74.38 (3.40)\t69.00 (2.12)\t74.75 (3.03)\nAccuracy\tvoices\t71.10 (3.52)\t63.70 (3.38)\t63.75 (4.00)\t73.60 (2.77)\t70.75 (3.17)\nRTs\tfaces\t542.90 (7.25)\t548.53 (10.95)\t533.97 (9.36)\t540.48 (8.55)\t533.19 (8.53)\nRTs\tvoices\t642.95 (6.30)\t628.81 (7.55)\t613.34 (8.25)\t571.55 (10.61)\t614.78 (6.21)\n### Caption\nMean accuracy in percent and response times (RTs) in milliseconds for each experimental condition.\n### Footer\nNote: Values in parentheses represent standard errors (SE).\n\n\n## ID: Tab3\n### Label: Table 3\nRegion of activation\tHemisphere\tx\ty\tz\tCluster mass\tCluster size (n voxels)\tt(max)\nSuperior Temporal Gyrus\tR\t58\t\u221250\t18\t1066.93\t301\t5.26\nSuperior Temporal Gyrus\tR\t48\t\u221218\t6\t247.7\t66\t5.85\nMiddle Temporal Gyrus\tR\t53\t\u221266\t7\t35.87\t11\t3.63\nInferior Frontal Gyrus\tR\t43\t15\t21\t47.03\t15\t3.59\nInferior Temporal Gyrus\tR\t37\t\u221260\t\u22123\t21.32\t7\t3.27\nMiddle Occipital Gyrus\tR\t24\t\u221286\t15\t220.16\t6\t3.73\nSuperior Frontal Gyrus\tR\t22\t27\t44\t24.63\t69\t3.31\nMedial Frontal Gyrus\tR\t11\t34\t37\t15.43\t9\t3.27\nCuneus\tL\t\u22121\t\u221278\t18\t20.86\t8\t3.08\nCingulate Gyrus\tL\t\u22123\t\u22129\t38\t31.61\t5\t3.65\nPosterior Cingulate Gyrus\tL\t\u22126\t\u221254\t23\t102.48\t7\t3.81\nCuneus\tL\t\u22124\t\u221298\t10\t15.84\t10\t3.43\nMiddle Frontal Gyrus\tL\t\u221225\t22\t36\t118.73\t32\t4.58\nInsula\tL\t\u221231\t\u221229\t22\t81.24\t11\t3.9\nMiddle Occipital Gyrus\tL\t\u221229\t\u221276\t10\t21.93\t5\t3.56\nInferior Frontal Gyrus\tL\t\u221233\t9\t28\t90.87\t36\t4.0\nMiddle Temporal Gyrus\tL\t\u221234\t\u221265\t19\t15.25\t5\t3.13\nInferior Frontal Gyrus\tL\t\u221255\t39\t7\t27.83\t7\t3.54\nPostcentral Gyrus\tL\t\u221250\t\u221225\t22\t19.13\t25\t3.38\nTransverse Temporal Gyrus\tL\t\u221256\t\u221222\t10\t31.62\t7\t3.43\n### Caption\nSignificant activations modelled by the parametric arousal effect irrespective of visual and auditory modalities.\n### Footer\nNote.

Speech processing also implicitly requires the analysis of the human voice, which conveys both linguistic and extra-linguistic information. However, due to technical and practical challenges when neuroimaging young children, evidence of neural correlates of speech and/or voice processing in toddlers and young children remains scarce. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 20 typically developing preschool children (average age \u200a=\u200a5.8 y; range 5.2\u20136.8 y) to investigate brain activation during judgments about vocal identity versus the initial speech sound of spoken object words. FMRI results reveal common brain regions responsible for voice-specific and speech-sound specific processing of spoken object words including bilateral primary and secondary language areas of the brain. Contrasting voice-specific with speech-sound specific processing predominantly activates the anterior part of the right-hemispheric superior temporal sulcus. Furthermore, the right STS is functionally correlated with left-hemispheric temporal and right-hemispheric prefrontal regions. This finding underlines the importance of the right superior temporal sulcus as a temporal voice area and indicates that this brain region is specialized, and functions similarly to adults by the age of five. We thus extend previous knowledge of voice-specific regions and their functional connections to the young brain which may further our understanding of the neuronal mechanism of speech-specific processing in children with developmental disorders, such as autism or specific language impairments. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe human voice is omnipresent in our lives, conveying both linguistic and extra-linguistic information and playing an integral role in our daily interactions. In addition to delivering language content, the human voice conveys rich acoustic information crucial for speaker identification, such as the fundamental frequency of the speaker's voice and the spectral formants produced through modification of the vocal tract that characterize individual vowels and consonants  \u2013 . The latter carries the prosodic features of communication   as well as emotional tone  , and additionally provides cues to determine age   and gender  \u2013 . Behavioral research has, for example, shown that infants as young as eight months old are able to recognize male and female voices  . Voice perception carries many different socially relevant features, demanding complex processes from our brain. It has been proposed that the cerebral processing of vocal information (e.g., speaker identity or affect) may be organized in interacting, but functionally dissociable pathways  \u2013 . Neuropsychological evidence  \u2013  suggests that voice and speech-sound directed information may be processed differently. \n\nAdults show a preference for general speech processing in bilateral temporal brain regions, particularly in superior temporal gyrus (STG) and superior temporal sulcus (STS;  ). Using neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG) or positron emission tomography (PET), a human-specific voice-processing region has been suggested in the upper bank of the right STS  ,  \u2013 . It is of note that some studies have identified voice processing areas in bilateral STS  ,  \u2013 . However, the vast majority of publications report right-hemispheric neuronal activation within the anterior part of the right STS, specifically when processing human vocal sounds  ,  ,  . The idea of voice-specific sound processing in humans is supported by studies comparing the neuronal correlates of vocal sounds to activation patterns evoked by frequency modulated tones   or by comparing human vocal sounds to those produced by animals  \u2013 . Although parts of the STS are activated in response to both vocal and non-vocal sounds (e.g., environmental or artificial sounds), vocal sounds produce greater neural responses than non-vocal sounds in most voice selective regions of the brain  ,  ,  ,  . Furthermore, fMRI evidence shows that activity in the right STS is greater when subjects perform a voice identity task (hearing several speakers say the same word) as opposed to speech-sound specific tasks  ,  ,  ,  , providing evidence for the involvement of the anterior portion of the right STS in processing voice identity. \n\nThe majority of research on the neural mechanisms of speech and voice processing has been conducted in adult participants; however, infant studies implementing passive listening experiments in the first years of life have been reported. Behavioral research using the head-turn procedure in newborns could, for example, show that newborns prefer human to non-human sounds, as well as prosodic to non-prosodic speech  . Neuroimaging methods, such as near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) or fMRI, have shed light on hemispheric specialization for speech, but provided mixed results. While some studies report increased activation during human speech processing within right temporoparietal brain regions (e.g.,  ; NIRS during human speech compared to flattened speech sounds in three month olds), others have suggested a left-hemispheric lateralization of human speech in newborns (e.g.,  ; optical topography during speech processing in newborns). Left-hemispheric lateralization of speech processing is further supported by fMRI evidence in three month old infants  \u2013 . \n\nSimilar to adult studies, the anterior STS in infants was observed to be critically involved during passive listening to human speech (e.g., comparing non-speech human emotional sounds versus familiar non-voice background noises;  ). However, unlike in adults, infants did not show different activation patterns when processing forward, as opposed to backward, speech, leading the authors to conclude that the precursors to adult-like cortical language processing were observable, but most likely not yet specialized  ,  . In line with this finding, Grossmann and colleagues   reported that four month-old infants did not display increased activation within bilateral superior temporal cortices when contrasting human speech with non-vocal sounds. However, at seven months, distinctive activation patterns can be observed during human voice and artificial sounds processing in left and right superior temporal cortex, comparable to results seen in adults  . To summarize, research so far has provided mixed results regarding the activation pattern representing speech processing in infancy (e.g.,  ,  ). However, the neuronal basis for speech is somehow similar to that of adults, increasingly so with age. Improved specialization, as observed by distinct neuronal activation to human speech sounds compared to a control condition (backward speech in  ; environmental sounds in  ), takes place between four and seven months- notably at a time when speech content is still fairly irrelevant  . \n\nThough there is evidence for the neuronal basis of passive speech and vocal information processing in infants, as well as plentiful studies in adults, a gap in neuroimaging studies exists with toddler and preschool-aged participants. However, technical improvements and increasingly more elaborate child-friendly neuroimaging protocols allow for the extension of studies into younger age ranges  \u2013 . This is of utmost importance since previous developmental neuroimaging work has demonstrated that there are significant differences between children and adults in regard to brain structure and function (e.g.,  \u2013 ); thus assumptions of a static model of the human brain are outdated  . Moreover, even though studies in infancy are able to inform about crucial aspects of brain organization and development closely after birth, a response-related cognitive functional neuroimaging task including behavioral feedback is not yet possible, and thus assumptions based on findings from research in sleeping infants may not easily be applied to waking children. Finally, evidence that the neuronal circuits for specific aspects of speech processing (e.g., phoneme discrimination) undergo changes in the first year of life to attune to native language sounds underscores the need for evaluation of the young brain before and after the onset of speech production  . To our knowledge, only one exemplary study has examined electrophysiological correlates of voice processing in a study of four and five year-olds. Comparing voices to environmental sounds resulted in an early measurable deflection (within 60 ms of onset) at right fronto-temporal sites, evidence for a right-lateralized response to voices in children  . The authors have suggested that this response may reflect activation of temporal voice areas in children. \n\nTo summarize, there is a general consensus regarding the neural location and functional correlates of voice processing in adults  \u2013 ,  ,  \u2013  and there is evidence for an early manifestation of this skill  . However, the precise anatomical localization, neuronal correlates and functional connectivity of voice processing in pre-school or school-aged children remains less well-understood. While infant research has explored activation in response to \u2018normal\u2019 forward speech compared to speech presented backwards, as well as between vocal and non-vocal sounds, few studies with pre-school aged children have investigated activation evoked specifically by varying aspects of native speech (for example, vocal pitch as compared to speech-sound specific content). Therefore, the current study employed whole brain fMRI in 20 typically developing pre-school children. The objective of the present work was to investigate cortical response to two auditory tasks in five year-old participants. The experimental task employed was voice directed (voice matching (VM): \u2018Is it the same person/voice talking or a different person?\u2019), while the second task was a speech-sound directed, phonological processing task (first sound matching (FSM): \u2018Do both words begin with the same first sound?\u2019). The same two voices, one male and one female, were maintained throughout both tasks. In a comparable study in adults, Von Kriegstein and colleagues   demonstrated that the right anterior STS is activated during tasks requiring voice processing but not when content directed processing was targeted. A follow-up fMRI study in adults   was furthermore able to identify distinct but interacting areas along the right STS responding to acoustic information stimuli, task demand and speaker-familiarity independently. Furthermore, previous evidence from fMRI studies suggests the bilateral STS to be crucial for processing human voices compared to non-speech sounds  . However, it has been suggested that the right STS alone is significantly more activated for processing nonverbal components of human speech (e.g., voice identity unrelated to verbal content;  \u2013 ). Therefore, we hypothesize that the right STS will be recruited during the voice but not speech-sound directed task in pre-schoolers, similar to the neuronal pattern observed in adult participants. To test this hypothesis, we explicitly investigate patterns of neural activation as well as functional connectivity during a voice identification task in right and left-hemispheric STS regions. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Ethics Statement \n  \nThis study and its consent procedures were approved by the Boston Children's Hospital Committee of Clinical Investigation (CCI). Written informed consent on behalf of the child participants was obtained from guardians (first degree relatives). Furthermore, research team members obtained verbal assent from child participants. Verbal assent, and not written consent, was obtained from child participants due to their young age (average age 5.8 y; children were non-readers and could not write yet). \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nTwenty healthy, native English speaking children (average age at the time of imaging: 5.8 years, age range 5.2 to 6.8 years) were included in the present analysis. Nineteen children were right handed, whereas for one child handedness could not be indicated yet (labeled as ambidextrous). All children were physically healthy with no history of any neurological or psychological disorders, head injuries, poor vision or poor hearing. All children scored within the normal or above-average range on verbal and non-verbal IQ (Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, 2  edition  ;  ). All children in the current study are part of the Boston Longitudinal Study of Dyslexia (BOLD) at the Boston Children's Hospital, a study that aims to investigate neural and behavioral characteristics of typical developing children compared to those with a familial risk for developmental dyslexia. Participants are invited for one behavioral and one neuroimaging session, including three functional experiments and structural image acquisition. The results presented here are from a subgroup of typically developing children at the first time point of neuroimaging (all children that had useful data obtained during the voice- and speech-sound-directed task were included). \n   Behavioral Group Characteristics.        \n\n### Behavioral Group Characteristics \n  \nParticipants were characterized with a test battery of standardized assessments examining language and pre-reading skills, such as expressive and receptive vocabulary (Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF Preschool 2nd edition;  ), phonological processing (Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP);   and Verb Agreement and Tense Test (VATT;  ) and rapid automatized naming (Rapid Automatized Naming Test;  ). Additionally, all participating families were given a socioeconomic background questionnaire (questions adapted from the MacArthur Research Network:  ; for a complete overview of SES questions see  ) and were asked questions regarding language development (see  ). All children were assessed for verbal and non-verbal IQ (KBIT average verbal IQ \u200a=\u200a110.1\u00b18.3; average non-verbal IQ\u200a=\u200a101.9\u00b111.8) and socioeconomic status (SES). Behavioral testing and imaging were performed on different days, however, there were no more than \u00b142 days between the two sessions on average (less than 1.5 months). \n\n\n### fMRI - Task Procedure \n  \nEach child performed two consecutive fMRI runs with identical designs, including timing and duration. One run consisted of a voice directed task (voice matching (VM): \u2018Is it the same person/voice talking or a different person?\u2019), while the other run consisted of a speech-sound directed, phonological processing task (first sound matching (FSM): \u2018Do both words begin with the same first sound?\u2019). The same two voices, one male and one female, were maintained throughout the tasks. The female voice had an average fundamental frequency of 218 Hz and was significantly higher in the test items [  t  (54)\u200a=\u200a15, p<.001] than the male voice (average fundamental frequency of 131 Hz.) The order of the two runs was pseudo-randomized (participants used a dice to determine the order).The FSM and VM tasks were presented in two separate runs in order to reduce task demands (e.g., task switching) for the young participants, based on previous experience carrying out neuroimaging studies in young populations (see also  \u2013 ,  ). During the    VM task    all children listened to two subsequently presented common object words spoken in a female or male voice via MR-compatible noise-reducing headphones (two seconds per word). During both runs, corresponding pictures were presented on the screen simultaneously in order to engage the children and to reduce working memory demands. The object words were followed by the presentation of a question mark, also displayed for two seconds. Using two child-friendly buttons placed on either side of the participant, children were asked to indicate via button-press whether the voice matched for the two words presented. This task was contrasted with a rest condition, during which the children were required to look at a fixation cross for the duration of the block. During    the FSM task   , participants were again asked to listen to two common object words, spoken in a female or male voice. Participants indicated via button press whether the two words presented started with the same first sound (e.g.,   bed   and   belt  ; \u201cyes\u201d, or not (e.g.,   bird   and   ant  ; \u201cno\u201d, for details see also  ). This task was again contrasted with a rest condition. Reaction time was measured from the start of the second word on and the response window lasted until the start of the consecutive trial for both tasks. \n\nTo avoid repetition effects (e.g.,  ), different word lists were created for the VM and FSM tasks. However, all words between the two runs were kept as comparable as possible by matching the two word lists for age of acquisition (e.g., when an average child recognizes a certain word; all words used here are recognized before 4 years of age by typically developing children), Brown verbal frequency, concreteness, imagery, numbers of letters, numbers of phonemes and numbers of syllables (MRWC Psycholinguistic and the IPNP Database;   and  ). All pictures were adapted from the standardized Snodgrass Picture System  . The same number of trials for VM and FSM matches were included in each run (for further task descriptions see  ). A sparse temporal sampling design allowed for the presentation of the auditory stimuli without scanner background noise interference  \u2013 . A total of seven blocks of VM/FSM and seven blocks of rest condition with an overall duration of 336 s seconds for each run were employed. Each block lasted 24 seconds and each block contained four trials. During the experimental and control tasks, 50% of the words were spoken in a male/female voice and 50% of all items matched regarding their first sound. The order of trials within a block was randomized, but kept constant across participants. \n\nEach child underwent extensive preparation and training in the mock MR scanner area before the actual neuroimaging session. Participants were familiarized with the voice and speech-sound directed task prior to the neuroimaging session using unique practice items. Instructions for each task were presented in separate short videos, which were shown in the MR scanner area and repeated prior to actual scanning. To reduce movement during the scanning procedure, cushions were used to stabilize the head and response buttons were placed at arm's length on each side of the child. A member of the research team observed the child during in-scanner performance and provided a tactile reminder to stay still during the session if needed (for a detailed description of the training protocol see  \u2013 ). \n\n\n### fMRI - Acquisition and Analysis \n  \nFor each run (experimental and control task), 56 functional whole-brain images were acquired with a 32 slice EPI interleaved acquisition on a SIEMENS 3T Trio MR scanner including the following specifications: TR 6000 ms; TA 1995 ms; TE 30 ms; flip angle 90\u00b0; field of view 256 mm; voxel size 3\u00d73\u00d74 mm, slice thickness 4 mm. Prior to the start of the first block, additional functional images were obtained and later discarded to allow for T1 equilibration effects. Stimuli were presented using Presentation software (Version 0.70,  ). The complete imaging session included 2 additional functional imaging tasks; actual scan time per task was 12 minutes each. \n\nImage processing and analyses were carried out using SPM5 ( ) executed in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Prior to statistical analysis, we first adjusted for movement artifacts within the acquired fMRI time series by realigning all images using a least squares approach to the first image (after discarding the first images to allow for T1 equilibration effects). In a second step, all images were spatially normalized into standard space, as defined by the ICBM, NIH-20 project  . It is to note that no customized child template was used and that consequent reports of coordinates and activation pattern are interpreted with caution due to the brain size differences of adults and children. Finally, all images were smoothed with an 8 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) isotropic kernel to remove noise and effects due to residual differences in functional and structural anatomy during inter-subject averaging (SPM5). Due to the age of participants, a rigorous procedure for artifact detection was implemented. We used the art-imaging toolbox ( ) to visualize motion, plot potential movement artifacts and review analysis masks for each subject. Upon visual inspection of all raw images, preprocessed images were used to create an explicit mask excluding potential artifactual brain volumes from the explicit mask through the art-imaging toolbox for each child. The art-imaging toolbox was then used to plot differences in motion between consecutive images and to review artifactual time-points: First, we identified all images that exceeded a movement threshold of 2 mm and a rotation threshold of 0.05 mm and checked that the analysis mask without said images contained all voxels (this step is necessary to ensure that there are no remaining outliers in the images within the defined threshold). Every image exceeding this threshold was then visually inspected, and movement and outlier regressors were added to the general linear model. Furthermore, volumes containing visible artifacts were regressed out and not modeled in further analyses. Prior to first level analysis, we ensured that the explicit mask was complete (inclusion of all brain voxels). The general linear approach implemented in SPM5 was used to analyze the data in a block design for each subject. Movement regressors were modeled as cofounds within the general linear model and explicit masking was performed during each subject's first level analysis to ensure inclusion of each voxel of the analysis mask. Contrast images (One sample t-tests) for \u2018VM>Rest\u2019, \u2018FSM>Rest\u2019, \u2018FSM>VM\u2019 (contend directed contrast) and \u2018VM>FSM\u2019 (voice directed contrast) were obtained for the whole group of children. Because of the lower signal-to-noise ratio in pediatric compared to adult samples and the relatively high inter-individual variance in pediatric datasets (e.g.  ), results are reported at a threshold of p<0.005 with a cluster extent threshold of k\u200a=\u200a10, as similarly employed by other pediatric studies (e.g.  ,  ). \n\n\n### Region of Interest (ROI) Analysis \n  \nPrevious research has shown involvement of the right anterior STS during voice processing, particularly during the analysis of extra-linguistic features of speech  . To investigate the role of the right anterior STS further, we defined an ROI for the anterior part of the right STS based on evidence in adults   (4 mm-sphere at Talairach coordinates of peak: 58,2,-8) using the MarsBaR toolbox  . Using the MarsBaR transformation function, we flipped this right hemispheric ROI to create a left-hemispheric analogue (left STS ROI). Mean parameter estimates were extracted for the two resulting regions of interest for the conditions \u2018VM>Rest\u2019, \u2018FSM>Rest\u2019 and \u2018VM<FSM\u2019 and \u2018VM>FSM\u2019 to further characterize the involvement of these regions during voice or speech-sound directed processing. A paired two-samples T-Test was employed to test for lateralization effects during \u2018VM>FSM\u2019. \n\n\n### Functional Connectivity MRI (fcMRI) Analysis \n  \nA post-hoc seed-to-voxel bivariate correlation analysis was performed using the MATLAB-based custom software package CONN  . Additional fcMRI analysis-specific preprocessing steps included temporal band-pass filtering and regression of nuisance variables including signal from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. Source seeds, defined as the right and left-hemispheric STS (as extracted for the ROI analysis) were specified as multiple seeds. Seed-based correlation maps were created by extracting the residual BOLD time series from the seed regions, which were followed by Pearson's correlation coefficients between the average time series of each seed and the time series of all other voxels. Seed-to-voxel correlation maps for the right and left STS for each subject and the condition \u2018VM>FSM\u2019 were created. For the second-level seed-based fcMRI analysis, results are reported at a significance level of p<0.005, uncorrected, and an ET of 50 voxels. \n\n\n### In-Scanner Performance \n  \nButton presses were recorded during voice and speech-sound directed speech processing tasks. Participants' in-scanner performance was closely monitored to ensure participation (for details see  \u2013 ). Children were instructed to indicate their answer as soon as they saw a question mark appear on the screen (after the presentation of the second word; for task design and figure see also  ), and responses were collected until the first word of the second trial was presented. Due to the nature of the task, however, children were able to form their judgment soon after the start of the presentation of the second word. Children were allowed to correct their response until the first word of a consecutive trial was presented. Task accuracy was calculated. The current study employs a block design; therefore trials with in-scanner performance errors were included in the analysis. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographics and Behavioral Group Characteristics \n  \nDemographics and behavioral group characteristics are listed in  . All children scored average or above average on standardized tests of pre-reading and language skills, including expressive and receptive language skills, phonological processing, rapid automatized naming, and verbal and non-verbal IQ. \n\n\n### In-Scanner Performance \n  \nDue to a technical problem, the behavioral response for one child is missing. Since the child's performance during training indicated that the child understood the tasks, we decided to include the participant in consequent analyses. Behavioral responses given by button presses during in-scanner performance indicate a recognition rate for the speaker identification task (VM) of 79.8% (average raw score of 22.3\u00b14.6 out of N\u200a=\u200a28), 13.7% incorrect (average raw score of 3.8\u00b14.2) and 6.6% misses (average raw score of 1.8\u00b11.7), and a recognition rate of 73.1% (average raw score of 20.5\u00b15.1), 18.6% incorrect (average raw score of 5.2\u00b14.1) and 8.3% misses (average raw score of 2.3\u00b12.5) during the speech-sound directed task (FSM). Paired two sample   t  -tests showed that there was no difference in the amount of correct responses between voice versus speech-sound directed tasks (p>0.05). Furthermore, no difference in reaction times were observed between the two tasks (p>0.05; VM RT\u200a=\u200a2338.1 ms/FSM RT\u200a=\u200a2305.4 ms). \n\n\n### fMRI results \n  \nWhole-brain analysis revealed increased activation for both voice directed (voice matching (VM)) and speech-sound directed processing (first sound matching (FSM)) in brain regions including bilateral middle occipital/fusiform gyrus, middle/inferior frontal gyrus, superior/middle temporal gyrus and inferior/superior parietal lobe when contrasted against rest ( ;  ). Focusing more on the initial speech sounds than speaker's voice (VM<FSM) activated a predominantly left-hemispheric language network including fusiform gyrus, inferior occipital/lingual and middle occipital gyrus (  ;   ; for an in depth discussion regarding the greater activation during the FSM task when compared to the VM task, see also  ). However, when focusing more on speaker identification compared to initial speech sounds (VM>FSM), brain activation occurred within the right anterior middle/superior temporal gyrus (  ;   ). \n   Neuronal activation patterns during voice or speech-sound directed information processing.  \nCerebral regions activated when attending to (  A  ) speakers voice (\u2018VM> Rest\u2019) or (  B  ) speech sounds (\u2018FSM> Rest\u2019).

In a first step, we defined an independent right-hemispheric functional ROI (a region of interest was derived based on the right anterior STS in adults  ) as well as a flipped left-hemispheric analogous ROI. In a second step, mean parameter estimates were extracted for these bilateral STS ROIs for the conditions \u2018VM>Rest\u2019, \u2018FSM>Rest\u2019, \u2018FSM>VM\u2019 and \u2018VM>FSM\u2019. There was significantly more activation during the speaker identification or voice matching task (\u2018VM>FSM\u2019: mean parameter estimates \u200a=\u200a0.2) compared to the speech-sound specific, or first sound matching task (\u2018FSM>VM\u2019: mean parameter estimates \u200a=\u200a\u22120.2; p>0.01) within right STS. Finally, we employed a paired two-samples T-test to assess lateralization effects for voice identification (VM>FSM) in anterior STS regions   and observed a significance of p\u200a=\u200a0.036, with the right anterior STS more strongly activated during voice identification compared to the left (see   for a complete overview; Notably, mean parameter estimates for higher decimals reported are close to, but not exactly opposite, most likely because of subtle masking differences between the two contrasts). Since we here investigate a very young pediatric population, but have based our ROI analysis on adult coordinates (  due to a lack of studies in younger children), we further replicated our ROI findings using a right anterior STS region of interest based on activation from our second level contrast during voice matching (\u2018VM>FSM\u2019) and achieved similar significant findings. We also performed a correlational analysis between behavioral measures and activity within our regions of interest to investigate the relationship between neuronal activation during voice matching and behavioral performance, however, we did not find any significant results. \n   Weighted mean parameter estimates in right and left STS during voice or speech-sound directed information processing.  \nWeighted mean parameter estimates extracted from regions of interest (  in blue  : right and   in orange  : left anterior STS) when focusing on speaker voice (\u2018VM>Rest\u2019), speech sounds (\u2018FSM>Rest\u2019), when focusing more on initial speech sounds of spoken object words than speaker voice (\u2018FSM>VM\u2019) and when focusing more on speaker voice than the initial speech sounds of spoken object words (\u2018VM>FSM\u2019; significant activation difference in right compared to left anterior STS with p\u200a=\u200a0.036). Weighted mean parameter estimates as extracted from right (rSTS) and left anterior STS (lSTS) regions of interest are summarized below the bar graphic. \n  \n\n### fcMRI Results \n  \nWe applied a post-hoc seed-to-voxel bivariate correlation analysis to explore networks of functionally connected regions with the seeds in the right and left STS as extracted for the ROI analysis. The seed-based analysis was performed for the contrast \u2018VM>FSM\u2019. Findings revealed positive correlations between right STS and left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and right-hemispheric supramarginal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), putamen, middle occipital gyrus (MOG), cingulate gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). For the left STS, we observed positive correlation with right-hemispheric superior frontal gyrus (SFG), postcentral gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) ( ).   shows the correlation maps for the left (  A  ) and right (  B  ) STS seeds (\u2018VM>FSM\u2019). \n   Functional connectivity maps during voice or speech-sound directed information processing.  \nStatistical functional connectivity maps when attending to speakers voice (\u2018VM> FSM\u2019) for (  A  ) the left STS and (  B  ) the right STS (p<0.005; k\u200a=\u200a50). \n     Main cortical regions that show connectivity with the two seed regions right STS (above) and left STS (below) in our connectivity analysis (\u2018VM>FSM\u2019).        \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current paper investigates voice-specific compared to speech-sound specific processing in preschool-aged children. When compared to rest, both voice and speech-sound directed tasks activate bilateral primary and secondary auditory language areas (e.g., bilateral superior and middle temporal gyri), but also components of the language network (e.g., inferior frontal, temporoparietal and occipitotemporal brain regions). Focusing on the speaker's voice compared to speech-sound directed processing led to an increase in activation in the right middle/superior temporal gyri. Since there were no significant differences in in-scanner performance between voice matching and the first sound matching task, we conclude that the results cannot be accounted for by increased difficulty or varying attentional demands in either condition. Our findings therefore indicate that the human-specific voice region is already specialized by the age of five and is similar to that seen in typical adults (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nOur results are in line with studies showing that the right STS is crucial for the extraction of the acoustic features related to voice recognition, similar to other speaker identification tasks  ,  \u2013 . Neuroimaging research has repeatedly implicated brain regions along the STS during voice and speech processing incorporating linguistic and extra-linguistic information, such as speaker identity, in the human  ,   and non-human brain  . It has been suggested that understanding speech content involves a hierarchy of processes. For example, sound-based representations of speech particularly rely on bilateral posterior-superior temporal lobes, whereas meaning-based representations are more strongly represented within the left temporal-parietal-occipital junction  . Furthermore, voice recognition differs from the analysis of speech-sound specific content in that it requires a fine-tuned analysis of the vocal structure of speech  . Similar to the model of face perception, it has been proposed that the neuronal voice perception system may represent an \u2018auditory face\u2019 model  . Our findings are in favor of such a fine-grained auditory analysis of the human voice. However, it is important to note that the task used in the current study required participants to match voices based on speaker gender, a task that requires processing of the acoustic properties inherent to the voice of the speaker. These cues include the fundamental frequency of the speaker (pitch) as well as the vocal quality (i.e. timbre, or spectral formants), which often provide context cues as to whether the speaker is male or female. Similarly, basic pitch processing has been implicated in the right auditory cortex in the STS/STG and planum temporale  \u2013 . Thus, since the present task does not require voice recognition per se, the activation of voice-specific brain regions may imply that the right anterior STS, along with right STS regions such as the planum temporale, processes acoustic voice identification features in general (such as pitch, vocal quality, and gender) in our age group. \n\nSeed-based fcMRI findings suggest that the right and left STS are correlated with distinct functional networks during voice processing in pre-school children. While the right STS correlates positively with left-hemispheric STG and right-hemispheric temporal, occipital and frontal regions, the left STS correlates with different right-hemispheric frontal and temporal regions. Three previous studies investigating voice identity in adults have reported positive correlations between contralateral STS and STG  ,  \u2013 . The observed positive correlations between the right STS and the right IFG and MFG in pre-school children are in line with findings reported in adults  \u2013 , which may suggest a higher cognitive involvement in voice identity matching based on individual vocal and glottal parameters. Thus, we suggest that functional correlations between the right STS and temporal/frontal regions during voice processing in pre-school children may be comparable to functional networks previously observed in adults. Finally, in line with our findings, both research groups reported positive correlations between the right STS and ipsilateral frontal regions such as the IFG   and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  . \n\nNotably, we employed a behavioral interleaved gradient design due to the nature of our auditory discrimination task. Others have previously demonstrated that functional networks can be observed by correlating sparse-sampled time-series data  \u2013 ,  \u2013 . Though not optimal for fcMRI analysis, this design is crucial for auditory experiments (e.g., in order to present auditory stimuli without interference from scanner background noises  \u2013 ), especially in the context of auditory selective attention. Scanner background noise (SBN) can increase BOLD signal in auditory and language regions resembling a task-induced hemodynamic response in a highly variable manner across subjects, and SBN during rest conditions can further mask or alter the BOLD signal in a non-linear fashion  . Since fcMRI is inherently more sensitive to non-neuronal sources of noise than traditional fMRI analysis, sparse temporal sampling may be warranted to avoid spurious correlations due to scanner background noise. Although we collected relatively fewer time-points with lower temporal resolution than typical of continuous scanning designs, Van Dijk and colleagues have shown that fcMRI is robust to long TRs  . Furthermore, the low-frequency fluctuations of interest in fcMRI (typically <0.1 Hz) should be captured within our 6 second TR, and we sampled a consistent number of time points across all conditions. \n\nBilateral superior temporal sulci have shown to be recruited for a wide range of pragmatic communicative tasks. Neuroimaging studies have implicated this brain region during tasks targeting theory of mind and mentalization  \u2013 , motion perception  \u2013 , person impressions  , gestures  , face   and speech perception   as well as social attention  . Because of the diversity of roles of the bilateral STS in social neuroimaging tasks, it has been argued that this region may be responsible for interpreting social communicative significance in general  . It has been hypothesized that the right STS may not be a voice-specific area in the human brain per se, but rather represents an area that is responsible for processing vocal sounds that are communicative in nature. For example, Shultz and colleagues   employed an fMRI task to demonstrate that neuronal activation within the right STS increases when presented with communicative vocal sounds (e.g., speech and laughter, see  ) in comparison with non-communicative vocal sounds (e.g., coughing and sneezing)  . These findings are in line with our results (where first-sound matching represents a non-communicative and voice-matching a communicative task). Understanding the role of the STS in differentiating between communicative and non-communicative sounds may be critical regarding implications for disorders of social communication, such as ASD; disorders in which the region within the right STS has been found to be hypoactivated (e.g.,  ). In addition, individuals with social communication disorders show structural alterations in brain regions which again include bilateral brain areas of the STS (e.g.,  \u2013 ). \n\nAlthough we observed significant differences when comparing the processing of voice- specific and speech-sound directed speech stimuli within the right anterior STS, we acknowledge certain limitations. It is noteworthy that only one female and one male voice were used in this study. For example, it has been shown that female voices may produce stronger neuronal responses than male voices, despite a right hemispheric dominance in the STG for both male and female voices  . However, the use of male and female voices has been counterbalanced across our experimental conditions. Future studies should include a wide range of different speakers, particularly varying in gender, fundamental frequency, or age. Furthermore, the current study employed a voice matching task, which does not necessarily demand recognition of speaker voice. Thus, these findings reflect the neural mechanisms involved in processing communicative vocal sounds, but need to be interpreted carefully in relation to general processes required for voice recognition. An additional potential limitation of the current study is the absence of an adult participant control group. However, there is a robust body of existing research demonstrating which regions are recruited in adults when completing similar tasks   and activation peaks from these studies have been adapted and further studied here. Still, we cannot rule out that there are not differences in brain activation and functional connectivity between children and adults without an adult control group. Finally, due to the aforementioned temporal restrictions of our study design and the BOLD signal itself, our fcMRI results are not directly comparable to connectivity work employing other neuroimaging modalities such as EEG or MEG, and therefore should be interpreted with caution. \n\nImpairments in speech perception or any of its related relevant features have been reported in various disorders of social communications or perception, including autism-spectrum disorder  , , schizophrenia  , Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease  \u2013 , as well as in patients with acquired brain injuries, such as phonagnosia  \u2013 , ventral frontal lobe damage   and right hemispheric dysfunctions  . Understanding the behavioral and neural basis of these disorders first requires greater knowledge about speech processing in typically developing populations. Due to technical and practical challenges, few neuroimaging research studies include younger children and many conclusions about infants and children with developmental disorders are based on the assumption of a static adult brain  . However, modern neuroimaging tools, such as EEG, MRI and NIRS, offer the means for research targeting abnormal brain growth, development and function in pediatric populations (e.g  \u2013 ). We suggest that the current findings in typically developing children may be utilized to broaden understanding of neurophysiological findings in atypically developing children, particularly within disorders of social communication. \n\nIn conclusion, the present study demonstrates neuronal differences between the processing of voice versus speech-specific information in preschool-aged children within right anterior STS. Our findings indicate that the human-specific voice region within the right anterior STS is already specialized by the age of five and is similar to that seen in typical adults. Additionally, positive functional correlations between the right STS with left-hemispheric STG and right-hemispheric temporal, occipital and prefrontal regions were observed. Our findings may have implications within the fields of typical and atypical language and social development. In particular, this work may guide future studies investigating young children with speech impairments and disorders of social communication. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n##

Several lines of evidence support the idea that ADHD is, in its core, a disorder of dysfunctional brain connectivity within and between several neurofunctional networks. The primary aim of this study was to investigate associations between the functional connectivity within resting state brain networks and the individual severity of core ADHD symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nResting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data of 38 methylphenidate-na\u00efve adults with childhood-onset ADHD (20 women, mean age 40.5\u2009years) were analyzed using independent component analysis (FSL\u2019s MELODIC) and FSL\u2019s dual regression technique. For motion correction, standard volume-realignment followed by independent component analysis-based automatic removal of motion artifacts (FSL\u2019s ICA-AROMA) were employed. To identify well-established brain networks, the independent components found in the ADHD group were correlated with brain networks previously found in healthy participants (Smith et al. PNAS 2009;106:13040\u20135). To investigate associations between functional connectivity and individual symptom severity, sex, and age, linear regressions were performed. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nDecomposition of resting state brain activity of adults with ADHD resulted in similar resting state networks as previously described for healthy adults. No significant differences in functional connectivity were seen between women and men. Advanced age was associated with decreased functional connectivity in parts of the bilateral cingulate and paracingulate cortex within the executive control network. More severe hyperactivity was associated with increased functional connectivity in the left putamen, right caudate nucleus, right central operculum and a portion of the right postcentral gyrus within the auditory/sensorimotor network. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe present study supports and extends our knowledge on the involvement of the striatum in the pathophysiology of ADHD, in particular, in the pathogenesis of hyperactivity. Our results emphasize the usefulness of dimensional analyses in the study of ADHD, a highly heterogeneous disorder. \n\n\n## Trial registration \n  \nISRCTN12722296 (10.1186/ISRCTN12722296). \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12888-019-2031-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and impairing psychiatric disorder characterized by varying degrees of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. ADHD is not limited to children and adolescents. In 40\u201360% of children with ADHD, the disorder persists into adulthood [ ]. In adults with ADHD, inattention may present as a lack of concentration, forgetting appointments, and a failure to plan and organize tasks, while hyperactivity may be experienced as restlessness and difficulty in relaxing [ ,  ]. ADHD symptoms frequently lead to problems at school and at the workplace as well as to difficulties with social interaction and relationships [ ]. \n\nThe pathogenesis of ADHD is incompletely understood. Clinical, genetic and experimental evidence suggests that ADHD is a multifactorial disorder, associated with neurochemical [ ], anatomical [ \u2013 ] and functional [ ,  ] changes of neuronal networks. The notion that ADHD is, in its core, a disorder of dysfunctional brain connectivity within and between several neurofunctional networks has gained wide acceptance [ ,  ]. \n\nOne way to investigate the circuitry of the brain is to perform resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). In contrast to task-based fMRI, rs-fMRI measurements record the spontaneous fluctuations of brain activity during wakeful rest, i.e. in the absence of an experimental task or stimulation. Using rs-fMRI, several distinct resting state networks (RSNs) have been identified in health and disease [ ]. \n\nBoth in children and adults with ADHD, a dysfunction of the default mode network (DMN) has been postulated. The DMN is a set of brain regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and medial prefrontal cortex, which are active during rest and become deactivated with the initiation of a task [ ,  ]. A pioneering rs-fMRI study on 20 ADHD adults (mean age: 34.9\u2009years; 16 men) and 20 healthy participants (mean age: 31.2\u2009years; 14 men) found decreased functional connectivity within the DMN and between posterior regions of the DMN (i.e., the precuneus and posterior cingulate) and the dorsal anterior cingulate [ ]. \n\nSince then, a large number of studies on rs-fMRI in individuals with ADHD have been published [ ]. Most of these studies have investigated children and adolescents and performed categorical analyses, comparing functional connectivity between individuals with ADHD and healthy controls. Several research groups have used the freely available ADHD-200 sample, consisting of rs-fMRI data of 285 children and adolescents with ADHD and 491 healthy age-matched controls [ ]  to address differences in functional connectivity in categorical and dimensional analyses [ \u2013 ]. \n\nOur primary interest lies in adults with ADHD [ ,  ]. For this population, only a relatively small number of studies on resting state functional connectivity is available. These studies confirmed and extended our pathophysiological knowledge of adult ADHD. However, most studies investigated adults who have received methylphenidate (for notable exceptions, see [ ]). In addition, most studies on adult ADHD performed categorical comparisons between individuals with ADHD and controls. As ADHD is a disorder of remarkable clinical heterogeneity, we decided to investigate functional connectivity within resting state networks in relation to ADHD symptom severity in a group of methylphenidate-na\u00efve adults with childhood-onset ADHD following a dimensional approach to investigate psychiatric disorders [ ]. \n\nTo study functional connectivity within neural networks, we performed a group independent component analysis (ICA) with dual regression. The group ICA identifies a set of independent component maps that are common to our entire sample. Dual regression is a mathematical approach that uses these independent component maps as network templates to identify the corresponding functional connectivity maps, indicating the strength of functional connectivity in each subject (for a detailed explanation, see [ ]). \n\n\n## Aim and hypotheses \n  \nThe aims of the present study are twofold. First, we will characterize well-established resting state networks, previously described in healthy individuals, in our sample of adults with ADHD. Second, we will investigate potential associations between the functional connectivity in these networks and the individual severity of core ADHD symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity). We hypothesized that functional connectivity within the default mode network will be smaller in individuals with ADHD with increased symptom severity. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study is part of a larger project on structural and functional changes of the brain in adults with ADHD. Structural MRIs from this project were analyzed using surface-based morphometry [ ]. Results of task-related fMRI measurements were reported by Bachmann et al. [ ]. \n\nResting state fMRI data sets from 59 adults with ADHD were analyzed for this study. Data sets were taken from a randomized controlled trial that compared the efficacy of a mindfulness training program (mindfulness awareness practice) to an active control condition (structured psychoeducation) in adult ADHD [ ]. A control group of healthy individuals was therefore not studied. All datasets analyzed here were recorded at baseline, i.e. before the mindfulness training program or psychoeducation started. \n\nAfter head motion correction using FSL\u2019s MCFLIRT [ ], 21 individuals were excluded because the maximum absolute displacement was >\u20091.5\u2009mm (half of the isotropic voxel size). The absolute displacement, as determined by MCFLIRT, summarizes translation and rotation across all three axes for every volume relative to the middle volume of the rs-fMRI data set [ ]. This criterion was chosen according to the rs-fMRI study by Mostert et al., investigating adults with ADHD using FSL\u2019s dual regression approach [ ]. Thus, the data sets of 38 individuals with ADHD (20 women) were included in the final analysis. Demographics and clinical characteristics of this sample are summarized in Table\u00a0 . The distribution of participants\u2019 age is illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 .   \nDemographics and clinical characteristics of all adults with ADHD included in the final data analysis \n  \nGerman:   Hauptschulabschluss  ,   Realschulabschluss  ,   Abitur  \n    \n1  a  .

All participants provided written informed consent. \n\nRecruitment of participants has been described previously [ ,  ]. In brief, participants were recruited at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany and through ADHD support groups. Inclusion and exclusion criteria have also been described previously [ ,  ]. In brief, we included individuals between 18 and 65\u2009years with childhood-onset ADHD, who never used methylphenidate. \n\n\n### Diagnosis and clinical data \n  \nThe diagnosis of ADHD was performed by experienced psychiatrists following DSM-IV criteria as described previously [ \u2013 ]. ADHD symptom severity was measured with the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales [ ] in the German long version with 66 items [ ]. We present the blind observer-rated CAARS scores (CAARS-O:L) on the inattention/memory problems, hyperactivity/restlessness, and impulsivity/emotional lability subscales. The distribution of the individual scores on the 3 subscales is illustrated in Fig.  . Psychiatric comorbidities were assessed using the German version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SKID) [ ]. \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nStructural and functional images of the brain were acquired on a 3 Tesla Siemens Magnetom Trio with a 12-channel head coil at the Freiburg Brain Imaging Center as described earlier [ ,  ]. In brief, a T1-weighted image was acquired using a three-dimensional MP-RAGE sequence with a voxel size of 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm . For the resting state measurement, T2*-weighted BOLD images were obtained with a voxel size of 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm  and 36 axial slices with a slice thickness of 3\u2009mm (TR\u2009=\u20092250\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms, no in-plane acceleration, 230 brain volumes, time of acquisition: 8:42\u2009min). The field of view covered the entire cerebrum, but only the most rostral parts of the cerebellum in most participants. All participants were instructed to lie quietly and keep the eyes closed without falling asleep. The resting state measurement was preceded by the T1-weighted image and 2 runs of a 1-back working memory task (time of acquisition: 6:16\u2009min each) and 2 runs of a stop signal task (time of acquisition: 6:09\u2009min each). These task-based fMRI measurements were not included in the present study. The results of the 1-back working memory task have been reported by Bachmann et al. [ ]. \n\n\n### Preprocessing of fMRI data \n  \nPreprocessing of resting state FMRI data was carried out using FMRIB\u2019s Software Library (FSL, version 5.09)  [ \u2013 ]. Preprocessing included removal of the first 5 volumes to allow for signal equilibration (225 volumes were retained) and head motion correction by volume-realignment to the middle volume using MCFLIRT [ ]. Brain extraction was performed using BET [ ]. Spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of 6\u2009mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) and grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire dataset by a single multiplicative factor were also done. \n\nAfter performing standard data preprocessing, without temporal filtering, independent component analysis-based automatic removal of motion artifacts (FSL\u2019s ICA-AROMA version 0.3 beta)  was used to identify and remove motion-related ICA components from fMRI data. Here, the \u201anon-aggressive\u2018 option was used, performing a partial component regression. ICA-AROMA carries out probabilistic ICA of individual subjects\u2019 rs-fMRI data using multivariate exploratory linear decomposition into independent components (FSL\u2019s MELODIC, version 3.14) [ ], employs four theoretically motivated temporal and spatial features to select motion-related components from MELODIC\u2019s output and finally removes these components from the initial data set through an ordinary least squares regression using FSL\u2019s   fsl_regfilt   command [ ]. ICA-AROMA is an effective strategy for removing motion-related artifacts from rs-fMRI data, preserving signal of interest and increasing the reproducibility of resting state networks [ ,  ]. ICA-AROMA does not require study-specific training (i.e. manual classification of artifact- and non-artifact-related independent components) and is thus a robust and generalizable approach. \n\nThe de-noised data sets were then high-pass filtered with a cutoff of 150\u2009s (0.007\u2009Hz). Registration of functional to high resolution structural images was carried out using boundary-based registration [ ] in FLIRT [ ]. Registration from high resolution structural to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI152) standard space was further refined using 12-parameter affine transformation and non-linear registration with a warp resolution of 10\u2009mm in FNIRT. \n\n\n### Identification of resting state networks \n  \nTo identify RSNs common to adults with ADHD, all data sets (  n  \u2009=\u200938, preprocessed and de-noised with ICA-AROMA as described above) were concatenated in temporal order to create a single data set. This concatenated data set was then decomposed into 20 spatially independent components using group ICA with MELODIC. A low-dimensional decomposition was chosen to facilitate the comparison of RSNs in adult ADHD with those identified in healthy adults [ ,  ,  ]. These 20 components will be used as template maps for dual regression (see next section). \n\nTo investigate the occurrence of previously described RSNs in adult ADHD, a spatial cross-correlation between these 20 independent components in our sample and the 20 independent components identified previously [ ] was calculated using FSL\u2019s   fslcc   command. MR image files of Smith et al.\u2019s template networks [ ] are available for download.  For further analysis and visualization (Fig.\u00a0 ), 10 canonical RSNs in our data were chosen that showed a high spatial correspondence (>\u20090.4) with the well-established RSNs published by Smith et al. [ ]. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis of resting state networks \n  \nTo investigate the associations between RSNs and clinical data (sex, age, and ADHD symptom severity), FSL\u2019s   dual_regression   script (version 0.5) was used [ ,  ]. In the first stage of dual regression, the full set of 20 template maps (the 20 independent components identified by group ICA) was regressed against each participant\u2019s 4-dimensional rs-fMRI data set, resulting in 20 time series per participant, one for each template map. In the second stage of dual regression, the component-specific time series were variance-normalized and regressed against each participant\u2019s rs-fMRI data set to identify participant-specific spatial maps corresponding to the 20 template maps. \n\nTo identify differences between women and men within the 10 canonical networks, a voxel-wise two-sample unpaired t-test with age as regressor of no interest was performed on the participant-specific spatial maps for each network using a general linear model. To identify associations between age and functional connectivity within the 10 canonical networks, age was used as regressor of interest with sex as regressor of no interest in the general linear model. To identify associations between ADHD symptom severity and functional connectivity within the 10 canonical networks, the individual scores on the inattention/memory problems, hyperactivity/restlessness, and impulsivity/emotional lability CAARS subscales were used as separate regressors of interest with sex and age as regressors of no interest. For non-parametric permutation testing, FSL\u2019s   randomise   (version 2.9) was used with 5000 permutations [ ,  ]. Statistical thresholding was performed with FSL\u2019s threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) [ ] and a family-wise error rate (FWE) of p smaller than 0.05. As the existing literature does not support specific hypotheses regarding the association between whole-brain networks and symptom severity in adult ADHD, this study needs to be exploratory. We decided not to perform correction for multiple comparisons (e.g. Bonferroni correction). To reduce the risk of false positive activation, we only accepted clusters larger than 100 voxels. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Head motion \n  \nFigure\u00a0  shows maximum head motion for every participant, expressed as absolute displacement (relative to the middle volume of the data set) and estimated by FSL\u2019s MCFLIRT. Across all participants, mean maximum head motion was 0.71\u2009mm (SD: 0.32\u2009mm). In the majority of participants, maximum head motion was smaller than 1\u2009mm.   \nMaximum head motion (absolute displacement) for all 38 adults with ADHD. The figure shows the maximum value of absolute displacement (mm), which summarizes translation and rotation across all three axes for every volume relative to the middle volume of the rs-fMRI data set \n  \n\n\n### Resting state networks in adult ADHD \n  \nAfter low-dimensional decomposition with MELODIC, the following RSNs, described by Smith et al. [ ], were also found in our sample: the visual, default mode, sensorimotor, auditory, executive control, and bilateral fronto-parietal networks. The DMN, one RSN in the study by Smith et al. [ ], is decomposed into two networks in our analysis, a ventral and a dorsal DMN. The cerebellar RSN, found by Smith et al., did not appear in our study because of the incomplete coverage of the cerebellum during rs-fMRI scanning. Figure\u00a0  illustrates the 10 RSNs identified in our sample of adults with ADHD (components 1\u20138, 10, 13 of the original 20-component group ICA).   \nTen resting state networks (RSNs) identified in a sample of 38 adults with ADHD, corresponding to the 10 RSNs found by Smith et al. [ ]. Brain images are displayed in radiological convention (the right hemisphere appears on the left side of the image) \n  \n\nAdditional file   Appendix 1 summarizes the 10 components that were excluded from further analyses (components 9, 11, 12, 14\u201320 of the original 20-component group ICA). Of those, component 9 is truncated because of incomplete coverage of the cerebellum. Component 11 shows strong activation of the anterior cingulate, similar to the executive control network included in further analysis (component 6 in Fig.\u00a0 ). Component 12 shows strong activation in the bilateral inferior frontal and temporal lobes, similar to the auditory and fronto-parietal networks included in further analysis (components 4, 9 and 10 in Fig.  ). The remaining components display primarily artifactual signal changes (i.e., non-neuronal noise). \n\n\n### Differences in functional connectivity between women and men with ADHD \n  \nAn independent t-test with age as covariate of no interest did not reveal significant differences in functional connectivity between women and men in our sample. \n\n\n### Associations between functional connectivity and age \n  \nIn ADHD participants with advanced age, a significant decrease of functional connectivity was found in the executive control network (IC 6), covering parts of the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and the bilateral paracingulate cortex (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nRegions of decreased functional connectivity in older individuals with ADHD within the executive control network (IC 6 in Fig.  ). The significant cluster covers parts of the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and the bilateral paracingulate cortex (cluster size: 493 voxels). The coordinates of the voxel with highest significance are: x\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20092\u2009mm, y\u2009=\u200942\u2009mm, z\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20092\u2009mm (  p  \u2009=\u20090.004). Brain images are displayed in radiological convention (the right hemisphere appears on the left side of the image). \n  \n\n\n### Associations between functional connectivity and ADHD symptom severity \n  \nIn ADHD participants with higher scores on the CAARS hyperactivity/restlessness subscale, increased functional connectivity was found within the auditory/sensorimotor RSN (IC 5). These areas cover parts of the left putamen, right caudate nucleus, right central operculum and a portion of the right postcentral gyrus (Fig.\u00a0 , Table  ). Scores on the inattention/memory problems and impulsivity/emotional lability subscales were not associated with changes in functional connectivity.   \nRegions of increased functional connectivity in adults with ADHD with higher scores on the CAARS hyperactivity/restlessness subscale within the auditory / sensorimotor resting state network.

First, on the group level, decomposition of resting state brain activity of adults with ADHD resulted in similar RSNs as previously described for healthy adults [ ]. Second, advanced age was associated with decreased functional connectivity in parts of the bilateral cingulate and paracingulate cortex within the executive control network. Third, higher scores on the CAARS hyperactivity/restlessness subscale were associated with increased functional connectivity in cortical and subcortical areas within the auditory/sensorimotor network. \n\n### Resting state networks in adult ADHD \n  \nThe RSNs found in our ADHD sample demonstrated a close correspondence to previously published RSNs in healthy adults [ ]. The RSNs by Smith et al. [ ] were derived from a group of 36 healthy individuals (15 women), similar in size to our sample. Moreover, rs-fMRI measurements by Smith et al. [ ] and for our study were performed with identical scanner hardware (a 3\u2009T Siemens Magnetom Trio with a 12-channel head coil). \n\n\n### Decreased functional connectivity with advanced age in adult ADHD \n  \nTo the best of our knowledge, the association between functional connectivity and age has not been investigated in adults with ADHD before. Here, we found a decrease of functional connectivity in the bilateral cingulate and paracingulate cortices within the executive control network in older ADHD participants (Fig.  ). In a previous study, we analyzed the structural MRIs acquired for this trial (  n  \u2009=\u200964) to determine cortical thickness and subcortical gray matter volumes using surface-based morphometry and subcortical segmentation as implemented in FreeSurfer [ ]. Interestingly, we found wide-spread cortical thinning and subcortical volume reduction associated with aging in adults with ADHD, but no significant decrease of cortical thickness in the bilateral cingulate and paracingulate cortices. These structural findings suggest that the age-related decrease in functional connectivity is a genuine phenomenon of brain function and not an epiphenomenon of gray matter loss. \n\nChanges in functional connectivity as a function of age have been described previously in healthy aging [ ,  ]. Thus, the observed decrease of functional connectivity in the bilateral cingulate and paracingulate cortex may be specific to ADHD or may be caused by unspecific aging processes. Of note, we did not find a decrease of functional connectivity in the default mode network in older individuals with ADHD. In healthy aging, a decrease of default mode connectivity is a widely replicated finding [ ,  ]. \n\n\n### Increased functional connectivity with higher scores on the hyperactivity/restlessness subscale in adult ADHD \n  \nWe also found increased functional connectivity in parts of the bilateral striatum (in particular, left putamen and right caudate nucleus), right central operculum and right postcentral gyrus in participants with higher scores on the CAARS hyperactivity/restlessness subscale (Fig.  ). The basal ganglia are a set of subcortical nuclei that subserve motor control, various cognitive functions and emotional processing, with the striatum being the primary input nucleus [ ]. More recently, evidence has accumulated that the basal ganglia are also involved in behavioral and neural inhibition in motor and non-motor functions [ ]. \n\nDysfunction of the basal ganglia and fronto-striatal circuits has long been suggested to be one of the core pathomechanisms of ADHD. This notion has been supported by the dopaminergic effects of methylphenidate, the major pharmacological treatment for ADHD. The reduction of subcortical gray matter in children with ADHD [ \u2013 ] appears to normalize in adults [ ] and is probably not involved in basal ganglia dysfunction in adults with ADHD. In a recent analysis of the structural MRIs of more than 500 adults with ADHD (>\u200921\u2009years) and more than 400 healthy controls, no significant difference in volume was found for any of the subcortical nuclei under investigation, including the caudate nucleus, putamen and pallidum [ ]. \n\nFunctional MRI of inhibitory control in adult ADHD led to inconsistent results [ ]. Sebastian et al. [ ] performed fMRI in stimulant-na\u00efve adults with ADHD during three different experimental tasks probing interference inhibition, action withholding and action cancelation. This study disclosed hypoactivation of the basal ganglia during action withholding and action cancelation [ ]. By contrast, a quantitative meta-analysis of fMRI studies on inhibitory control in 100 adults with ADHD in total (including individuals receiving long-term stimulant medication) concluded that adults with ADHD have hypoactivation of the right inferior frontal cortex and right thalamus relative to controls, but no hypoactivation of the basal ganglia [ ]. \n\nA recent study by Mostert et al. [ ] compared rs-fMRI in 99 adults with ADHD with 113 healthy individuals and found stronger functional connectivity in the anterior cingulate gyrus of the executive control RSN, but no differences in connectivity in the basal ganglia or the default mode network. \n\nThe aforementioned studies performed categorical comparisons between individuals with ADHD and healthy controls. ADHD, however, is characterized by a remarkable phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity [ ,  ] and comparisons on the group level may fail to uncover neural dysfunction in heterogeneous ADHD samples. For this reason, we performed dimensional analyses with the individual levels of symptom severity as continuous regressors [ ] which enabled us to detect associations between a clinical parameter (hyperactivity/restlessness) and resting state brain activity. \n\nIn a large sample of adolescents with ADHD, Oldehinkel et al. [ ] performed both categorical and dimensional analyses of functional connectivity in striatal networks. Comparing 169 adolescents with ADHD and 122 healthy individuals did not reveal functional differences in striatal networks. A dimensional analysis, by contrast, demonstrated an association between increased hyperactivity/impulsivity scores and increased inattention scores with increased functional connectivity in the networks of posterior putamen and ventral caudate [ ]. Similarly, in children with the hyperactive-impulsive subtype of ADHD, increased connectivity in the cortico-striatal network was found, whereas children with the inattentive subtype showed increased connectivity in the ventral attention network [ ]. The results of the present study corroborate the findings of Oldehinkel et al. [ ] and Sanefuji et al. [ ]. In summary, a dimensional approach may be better suited to identify changes in basal ganglia connectivity [ ,  ] than a categorical approach [ ]. \n\nContrary to our initial hypothesis, no significant associations between functional connectivity within the ventral and dorsal DMNs and the symptom severity scores were identified in the present study. This result is also in contrast to previous studies in childhood, adolescent and adult ADHD, describing weaker connectivity within the DMN in individuals with ADHD vs. controls [ ]. In adult ADHD, decreased functional connectivity was found between the anterior cingulate and the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex regions in a seed-based analysis [ ] and between the precuneus and other areas of the DMN using a network homogeneity analysis [ ]. By contrast, the large study on resting state functional connectivity by Mostert et al. consisting of 99 adults with ADHD, using group ICA and dual regression very similar to the present study, did not find differences in DMN connectivity between adults with ADHD and controls. Taken together, the involvement of the DMN in adult ADHD is not well established. Future studies are needed with larger sample sizes, comparing and integrating the results of different analysis strategies. \n\n\n### Strengths and limitations \n  \nOur study comprises a clinically-well characterized sample of 38 methylphenidate-na\u00efve adults with ADHD. Many studies in the field include participants with long-term stimulant medication as well (and discontinue medication ~\u200924\u201348\u2009h before fMRI, e.g. [ ,  ]. Investigating a stimulant-na\u00efve sample is beneficial because of potential effects of long-term stimulant medication on brain structure and function [ ,  ]. Another strength of our study is a stringent two-step head motion correction with a standard motion correction with volume-realignment and an additional ICA-based de-noising of the preprocessed data sets. \n\nLimitations of our study are the absence of a healthy control group, which prevented us from performing categorical comparisons between adults with ADHD and healthy individuals. Moreover, the fMRI scans used for this study did not cover the entire cerebellum, a structure, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ADHD [ ]. \n\nFuture studies of resting state brain activity in ADHD should make use of advanced imaging techniques that allow a considerable reduction of the TR (simultaneous multislice imaging) [ ]. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis study corroborates and extends our knowledge on the involvement of the striatum in the pathophysiology of ADHD, in particular, in the pathogenesis of hyperactivity. Moreover, we found, for the first time, a decrease of functional connectivity in the bilateral cingulate and paracingulate cortices within the executive control network in older individuals with ADHD. Significant associations between functional connectivity in the default mode network and symptom severity, sex or age were not found. Our results emphasize the usefulness of dimensional analyses with individual symptom severity and age as regressors in the study of ADHD, a highly heterogeneous disorder. \n\n\n## Additional file \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nAge\tAge.1\nMean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (range)\t40.5\u2009\u00b1\u200910.4\u2009years (21\u201361\u2009years)\nGender\tGender\nWomen\t20 (52.6%)\nMen\t18 (47.4%)\nEducation\tEducation\nSecondary school (until grade 9)1\t6 (15.8%)\nSecondary school (until grade 10)2\t11 (28.9%)\nHigh school diploma (until grade 12 or 13)3\t15 (39.5%)\nUniversity degree\t6 (15.8%)\nCAARS (observer-rated)\tCAARS (observer-rated)\nMean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (range)\t\nInattention/memory problems\t19.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9 (2\u201331)\nHyperactivity/restlessness\t16.4\u2009\u00b1\u20097.5 (2\u201327)\nImpulsivity/emotional lability\t15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9 (2\u201332)\nADHD subtype\tADHD subtype\nCombined\t31 (81.6%)\nInattentive\t7 (18.4%)\nCo-morbidities: current axis I disorders\tCo-morbidities: current axis I disorders\nMinor depressive disorder\t20 (52.6%)\nAnxiety disorder\t7 (18.4%)\nObsessive-compulsive disorder\t2 (5.3%)\nCo-morbidities: lifetime axis I disorders\tCo-morbidities: lifetime axis I disorders\nSubstance dependence\t7 (18.4%)\nEating disorder\t4 (10.5%)\nCo-morbidities: lifetime axis II disorders\tCo-morbidities: lifetime axis II disorders\nAvoidant personality disorder\t5 (13.2%)\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder\t2 (5.3%)\nDependent personality disorder\t1 (2.6%)\n### Caption\nDemographics and clinical characteristics of all adults with ADHD included in the final data analysis\n### Footer\nGerman: 1Hauptschulabschluss, 2Realschulabschluss, 3Abitur\n\n\n## ID: Tab2\n### Label: Table 2\nRegion\tNo. of voxels\tx (mm)\ty (mm)\tz (mm)\tp-value\nL putamen\t461\t\u221219.3\t6.4\t\u22124.3\t0.009\nR caudate\t372\t17.2\t13.6\t8.4\t0.011\nL postcentral gyrus\t235\t67.4\t\u22124.3\t31.2\t0.019\nR central operculum\t224\t61.7\t\u22123.8\t6.3\t0.014\n### Caption\nRegions of increased functional connectivity in adults with ADHD with higher scores on the hyperactivity/restlessness subscale\n### Footer\nThe x, y, and z coordinates represent the center of gravity of the entire cluster\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6347794, "text_md5": "595bff96b9821f538f57ba4808aa060d", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 204], "journal": [205, 219], "publication_year": [221, 225], "title": [236, 381], "keywords": [395, 491], "abstract": [504, 3087], "body": [3096, 32437], "tables": [32450, 34284]}, "batch": 4, "pmid": 30683074, "doi": "10.1186/s12888-019-2031-9", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347794", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6347794"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347794\">6347794</a>", "list_title": "PMC6347794  Hyperactivity/restlessness is associated with increased functional connectivity in adults with ADHD: a dimensional analysis of resting state fMRI"}

To identify whether regional homogeneity (ReHo) changes are also different between EOD and LOD by using same cut-off age, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect the abnormal ReHo between patients with EOD and LOD in the present study. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nResting-state fMRI scans of 58 patients with EOD, 62 patients with LOD, 60 young healthy controls (HC), and 52 old HC were obtained. The ReHo approach was used to analyze the images. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe ANOVA analysis revealed that the ReHo values in the frontoparietal, occipital, and cerebellar regions were significantly different among the four groups. Relative to patients with LOD, patients with EOD displayed significantly increased ReHo in the left precuneus, and decreased ReHo in the right fusiform. The ReHo values in the left precuneus and the right fusiform had no significant correlation with the score of the depression rating scale or illness duration in both patient subgroups. Compared to young HC, patients with EOD showed significantly increased ReHo in the right frontoparietal regions and the right calcarine. Furthermore, the increased ReHo in the right frontoparietal regions, right insula and left hippocampus, and decreased ReHo in the left inferior occipital gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus, left calcarine, and left supplementary motor area were observed in patients with LOD when compared to old HC. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe ReHo of brain areas that were related to mood regulation was changed in the first-episode, drug-naive adult patients with MDD. Adult patients with EOD and LOD exhibited different ReHo abnormalities relative to each age-matched comparison group, suggesting that depressed adult patients with different age-onset might have different pathological mechanism. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is an affective disorder with clinically heterogeneous features. Previous study found depressed patients with different age of onset have different clinical features[ \u2013 ]. For examples, relative to later onset (LO) depression, patients with early onset (EO) depression are usually with higher positive family history[ ], higher suicidal thought[ ]or suicide attempts[ ], and commonly comorbid with personality disorder[ ]. Some other previous studies also found the EO depression was associated with more anxiety than LO depression[ ,  ]. A meta-review also indicated that the different age-onset depression might be different subtypes of depression[ ]. In addition, the heritability of LO depression (>30 years) is lower than that in EO depression (<30 years) (10% vs 47% respectively)[ ]. In summary, these clinical findings together with the diverse heritability implicated that depression with different age of onset might have different pathological mechanism. \n\nHowever, the clinical features mentioned above between EO and LO depression were depended on variety cut-off age, there is inconsistency with the cut-off age for early- and later-onset depression. A previous study considered the EO depression as the first episode occurring before age 18 years[ ], whereas, another study also considered the EO depression as the first episode occurring before age 30 years[ ,  ]. On the other hand, the LO depression was defined as the first episode occurring after age 40[ ] or 50[ ] or 60[ ] years. The biological evidence for the cut-off age in these studies remains unclear. Thus far, there is no consensus upon the age of onset in defining EO vs. LO MDD. \n\nFor decades, the neuroimaging has been widely used to explore the pathomechanism of MDD. The regional homogeneity (ReHo) was used to detect a given voxel that is temporally similar to its neighbors within a single region[ ]. The abnormal ReHo reflects the changes of temporal aspects of neural activity in the regional areas. Additionally, the ReHo method has been used to investigate the neural activity change in depression[ \u2013 ] and a ReHo study provided some evidence to distinguish EO and LO MDD[ ]. To our knowledge, there was only one study used ReHo to analyze the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to distinguish patients with EO MDD from those with LO MDD[ ]. The study revealed that patients with EO MDD and those with LO MDD have abnormal neural activities in different brain regions. However, there was a large age gap between EO MDD and LO MDD in their study. The age of patients with EO MDD were under 35 years while the age of patients with LO MDD were over 60 years in their study[ ]. Thus, the actual abnormal neural activities between EO MDD and LO MDD remains unclear. On the other hand, the onset age after 45 years was associated with increased familial risk of vascular disease in MDD[ ], suggesting the pathological mechanism of MDD that occurs after age 45 years might be different from MDD occurs before the age of 45 years. What is more, one recent study from ENIGMA found the smaller hippocampus volume in MDD might moderated by age of onset[ ], suggested the age of onset is a great important factors in analyzing anatomical change in MDD patients and highlighting the age of onset should be considered carefully in detecting pathomechanism of MDD. More recently, one of our studies found that early adult onset depression (EOD) and later adult onset depression (LOD) exhibited different whole brain grey matter volume (GMV) by using 30-year-old as the cut-off age[ ]. Moreover, our another study also found specific abnormalities in the brain circuitry between EOD and LOD by using the same cut-off age[ ]. So it seems 30 years might be an appropriate cut-off age for distinguishing EOD and LOD. However, previous studies found there was a dissociation pattern of brain anatomical deficits and functional change[ ,  ], especially with regard to GMV and ReHo[ ], which suggested brain functional and anatomical change might contributed independently to pathomechanism of MDD. \n\nTherefore, based on our previous work and avoiding the vascular disease in older patients (>45 years old), we sought to examine whether the MDD patients with the onset age between 18\u201344 years old (the age was 18\u201345 years) could also be distinguished by abnormal ReHo in the present study. We hypothesized that the EOD (age 18\u201329) and LOD (age 30\u201344) patients would have different regional neural activities. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### 1.1 Ethics statement \n  \nAll participants and guardians gave written informed consent. This study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan Province, P. R. China. \n\n\n### 1.2 Participants \n  \nAll patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic or inpatient wards of the Psychiatry Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University. Right-handed, 147 MDD patients (50 males and 97 females) met the criteria were recruited in the depression group. The inclusion criteria were as follows: \u2460 The diagnosis of MDD was independently made by two experienced psychiatrists in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV, American Psychiatry Association, 1994), \u2461 first episode without a history of antidepressants treatment, \u2462 be aged between 18\u201345 years, \u2463 the total score of 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was not less than 17, \u2464 right handedness, \u2465 the patients or their legal guardian signed the informed consent form. The exclusion criteria included the following items: \u2460 having a history of Axis I psychiatric disorders. \u2461 having a history of neurological illnesses or other severe diseases, \u2462 having a history of brain injury or obvious psychiatric symptoms, \u2463 with substance abuse, \u2464 having received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation(TMS) or systematical psychotherapy, \u2465 pregnant or nursing women and \u2466 having physical limitations prohibiting them undergoing MRI scans. \n\n130 sex-, and age-, matched healthy controls (49 males and 81 females) were also recruited in the healthy control group and excluded: \u2460 with a family history of psychiatry, \u2461 with a psychiatry disorder, \u2462 with a severe physical disease and/or neurological disease, \u2463 with substance abuse, \u2464 with a history of brain injury, \u2465 pregnant or nursing women, or \u2466 inability to undergo a MRI scan. \n\nAll participants underwent the MRI scans. All of the participants were recruited from February 2012 to July 2015. Each MDD patient and HC was assigned a number at the time of recruitment. Their data including demographic information, clinical and imaging data can be indentified through the number but not their name. The checklist is available as supporting information (see  ) \n\n\n### 1.3 Methods \n  \n#### 1.3.1 Clinical materials and subgroups \n  \nData were collected from all participants including age, sex, education level and the duration of depression. The depressive symptoms were assessed by an experienced psychiatrist using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS, Hamilton 1960). Based on previous research[ ,  ], all patients were divided into two subgroups: the EOD group (18\u201329 years) and the LOD group (30\u201344 years). The HC were correspondingly divided into two subgroups: the young HC and the old HC. \n\n\n#### 1.3.2 Image acquisition \n  \nMRI scanning was performed by a skilled radiological technician on a Philips Achieva 3.0-T MRI scanner. Restraining foam pads were used to minimize head motion. Participants were also informed to keep eyes closed and without thinking during scanning. Normal T1 and T2-weighted MRI scans were first performed to exclude obvious structural abnormalities. The parameters were as follows: time of repetition (TR)/time of echoing (TE) = 2500/80ms, slice thickness = 6 mm, field of vision (FOV) = AP(250mm)\u00d7RL(193mm)\u00d7FH(142mm), matrix size = 128\u00d7128, flip angle = 90\u00b0, slices = 16, gap = 2mm, scan duration time = 45sec. \n\nThe resting-state functional images were acquired by using an echo-planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: TR/TE = 2200/35ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, FOV = 230\u00d7230mm, matrix = 128\u00d7128, slice thickness = 3.0mm without interlayer spacing, slices = 50, scan duration time = 17min40sec. All of the sections were acquired parallel to the anterior-posterior commissure line. \n\n\n\n### 1.4 fMRI imaging preprocessing \n  \nAll primary DICOM images were converted into NIfTI format using the MRIConvert software ( ). Then, fMRI image preprocessing was performed in the statistic parametric mapping software package (SPM8, ) running in the Matlab 2012a (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and in the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF,  ) [ ]. The steps of preprocessing were as follows: First, the first 10 volumes were discarded and the slice timing and head motion were corrected. Second, the spatial normalization was performed by using the standard EPI template in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space in SPM8 and then normalized images were resampled to 3\u00d73\u00d73 mm . Finally, the resulting data were filtered at 0.01\u20130.08Hz frequency range to reduce low-frequency drift and high-frequency physiological respiratory and cardiac noise. \n\n\n### 1.5 ReHo calculation \n  \nThe ReHo calculations were also performed automatically by using the DPARSF software. Briefly, Individual ReHo mappings were generated by calculating the Kendall's coefficient concordance (KCC) of the time series of a given voxel with those of its nearest neighbors[ ]. The number of neighboring voxels was set as 26. The consistency and similarity for each individual were assessed by calculating the KCC of the time series of one given voxel with those of its adjacent voxels in a voxel-wise analysis assuming that a voxel was temporally similar to those of its neighbors[ ]. To reduce the influence of individual variations, the normalization of ReHo mapping was carried out by dividing the KCC among each voxel by the average KCC of the whole brain for each subject[ ,  ]. Finally, the resulting mapping was spatially smoothed by convolution with a 4-mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. \n\n\n### 1.6 Statistical analysis \n  \nStatistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 17.0 for Windows). The distributions of age and years of education of the four groups were compared by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the chi-square test was used to compare the sex distribution. Two sample   t  -tests were used to compare the illness duration and HDRS score between the two patient subgroups. The significance threshold was set at p<0.05. \n\nA voxel-based ANOVA comparison of the whole brain ReHo maps among the four groups was performed in REST software ( ). The statistical threshold was set at p<0.05 after false discovery rate (FDR) correction with an extent cluster of 100 contiguous voxels or greater, by using age, sex, grey matter volume and education level as covariates. Then post hoc t-tests were conducted to identify voxel-wise difference on the ReHo maps between each pair of groups by using the same covariates mentioned above (p<0.05, corrected for FDR with an extent of more than 100 contiguous voxels). In addition, both EOD and LOD patients were drug-naive and in their first episode, with a short illness duration. In order to detect subtle abnormal regional neural activities between the two subgroups, a more lenient statistical threshold (p<0.05 uncorrected and an extent threshold of more than 100 voxels) was applied when no significant result was found at p<0.05 FDR corrected. \n\nTo investigate the relationship between abnormal regional neural activities and clinical features, brain regions with abnormal ReHo were identified as regions of interest. Mean values of ReHo were extracted using the REX toolbox ( ). Pearson partial correlations were conducted between these abnormal values of ReHo and HDRS score or illness duration in each patient's subgroup in SPSS, controlling for age, sex, and education level in SPSS. The threshold of p<0.05 was considered to be significant for these analyses. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### 2.1 Demographic data \n  \nIn order to detect actual differences among different subgroup, 45 subjects (14 EOD, 13 LOD, 12 Yong HC, and 6 Old HC) were excluded due to excessive head movement (>1.5\u00b0and > 1.5 mm). Finally, 58 patients with EOD, 62 patients with LOD, 60 young HC, and 52 old HC were included in this study. The demographic information and clinical features were presented in  . There was no significant difference in age or sex between MDD and HC, as well as between EOD and LOD relative to each age-matched comparison group. However, since the control subjects had a higher educational level than depressed patients, years of education was used as a covariate in the analysis. There was no significant difference in terms of illness duration, HDRS score between the two patient groups. \n   The demographics and clinical characteristics of the sample.        \n\n### 2.2 Abnormal ReHo among groups \n  \n showed the one-way ANOVA analysis of the ReHo value among the four groups with age, sex, grey matter volume, and education level as covariates.

We used the REX toolbox to extract the mean values of ReHo in the right fusiform and the left precuneus in both patient groups respectively. There was no significant correlation between the ReHo value of the right fusiform and left precuneus and the symptom severity (HDRS) in neither the EOD group (r = -0.080 p = 0.562; r = 0.074 p = 0.590) nor the LOD group (r = 0.151 p = 0.254; r = -0.048 p = 0.719). Similarly, no significant correlation was observed between the ReHo value of the two brain regions and illness duration in neither the EOD group (r = 0.095 p = 0.488; r = 0.005 p = 0.970) nor the LOD group (r = -0.023 p = 0.865; r = 0.094 p = 0.478) after controlling for sex, age and education level. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn our previous study, we found specific regional GMV differences between patients with EOD and LOD. For further clarifying the core neuropathology of MDD, we used the approach of regional homogeneity to explore the regional neural activities in the same large sample in the present study. Firstly, widespread abnormalities of ReHo throughout frontoparietal, limbic regions, occipital cortex, and cerebellum were observed in patients with MDD. The findings are partly consistent with previous ReHo studies[ ,  ]. These brain regions are important components of the limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic (LCSPT) circuit[ ], which suggests that the pathogenesis of MDD is related to the abnormal function of the LCSPT circuit. Secondly, the most important finding was that patients with EOD or LOD exhibited different ReHo abnormalities when compared to each matched HC subgroup. A different form of ReHo abnormalities was also observed when compared the EOD subgroup to the LOD subgroup. \n\nIn the present study, relative to LOD, patients with EOD exhibited ReHo increased in the left precuneus and decreased ReHo in right fusiform. The ReHo increased in precuneus between EOD and LOD was in line with the finding of a previous study which revealed the EO MDD group had significantly increased ReHo in precuneus compared to LO MDD group[ ]. They speculated the ReHo value increased in precuneus might be a diagnostic marker to distinguish EO MDD from LO MDD. Moreover, the bilateral precuneus (PCu)/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is the core region of the default mode network (DMN) at resting-state[ ,  ]. Previous neuroimaging studies have exhibited that the MDD patients displayed altered activity patterns in the DMN [ ,  ]. Abnormal functional of DMN might be characteristic of first-episode, drug-naive patients with MDD was supported by a Meta review[ ]. On the other side, the genetic factors that influence DMN connectivity, the heritability for DMN was 0.424\u00b10.17[ ]. Further, the evidence of functional connectivity of DMN was different between the adolescents who were at high familial risk for developing clinical depression and those who were at low familial risk for depression was also found in previous study[ ], supporting the DMN connectivity may also be influenced by genetic factors in patients with MDD. Considered the heritability[ ] and family history[ ] of EOD is higher than that in LOD, it is speculated the ReHo value deficit in precuneus within DMN between EOD and LOD patients might be caused by genetic factors. In addition, the DMN has been showed to be involved in self-referential activities[ ] and related to negative rumination in depression[ ]. The precuneus also related to consciousness, such as self-reflection, self-awareness and episodic memory[ ]. On the other side, relative to healthy control, decreased regional homogeneity in the right precuneus in late life depression was also reported in previous study[ ], suggesting the important role of PCu in the pathophysiology of the late stage of depression. Thus, the decreased ReHo in the precuneus of patients with LOD might implicate that the consciousness deficit associated with self-reflection, self-awareness and episodic memory is more severe in patients with LOD than those with EOD. Moreover, the GMV decrease in the right PCC/ PCu was observed in patients with EOD compared to those with LOD in our previous study[ ], which further suggested PCC/ PCu is a potential region of distinguishing EOD from LOD. In addition, no significant correlation between HDRS score or illness duration and the left precuneus ReHo may imply that ReHo increased in the left precuneus was independent of depressive symptom severity or illness duration. Therefore, these findings suggested that the left precuneus may be an appropriate brain region for differentiating patients with EOD and LOD at the neural activity level. \n\nThe fusiform gyrus, another finding between patients with EOD and patients with LOD, is a part of visual cortex. The visual cortex was reported to have abnormal neural activities in patients with MDD[ ]. The amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) decreased in the right fusiform gyrus has been observed in first episode, treatment-naive patients with MDD[ ]. A previous study suggested the fusiform together with temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, right angular gyrus and right parahippocampus gyrus may be related to cognitive processing[ ]. Another study suggested the fusiform, inferior occipital gyrus and superior temporal gyrus composed the key regions of processing emotional facial expressions[ ]. In addition, biases in interpretation of emotional facial information and in processing affective stimuli may be one of underlying mechanisms in the development of MDD in young people[ \u2013 ], and has been proved related to dysfunction of fusiform gyrus[ ]. Furthermore, Our previous work found that relative to young healthy controls, patients with EOD showed GMV reduction in the right fusiform [ ], indicating patients with EOD might have deficits in processing emotional facial stimuli. The ReHo value decrease in the fusiform was observed in patients with EOD compared to those with LOD in the present study, which implicated that the deficit in emotional facial stimuli which reflected the cognitive processing might be more severe in patients with EOD than patients with LOD. What is more, an MRI twin study revealed that the GMV reduction in fusiform gyrus were related to a genetic risk for depression[ ], which highlighted the fusiform gyrus would be an important brain region related to genetic factors in depression. Additionally, the heritability of early onset depression is higher than that in late onset depression[ ]. Thus, it is speculated that the ReHo value alteration in fusiform gyrus might be caused by genetic factors which reflected the heritability is different between patients with EOD and LOD. Nevertheless, the ReHo value of right fusiform was not correlated with HDRS score or illness duration, which also indicated the right fusiform might be another potential region for distinguishing EOD and LOD at the neural activity level. \n\nLOD Patients showed an increased ReHo value in the hippocampus and insular. A wealth of studies on patients with MDD revealed that the hippocampus plays a crucial role in the pathologic mechanism of MDD[ ]. Evidence from the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics Through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA) study[ ] and our previous study[ ] revealed that the hippocampus volume in MDD might be moderated by age of onset. Our previous study also suggested that the pathological mechanism of LOD might be related to a smaller hippocampus volume. However, previous studies suggested the brain anatomical and functional abnormalities might independently contribute to the pathomechanism of MDD[ ,  ]. Thus, the abnormal ReHo value in the left hippocampus might also be related to the pathogenesis of LOD MDD. The increased ReHo value in the left hippocampus in the present study may be a functional compensation for the morphological changes of the right hippocampus in LOD patients. The insular cortex connects with fronto-limbic regions[ ]. Previous studies found that the metabolism in insular cortex would enhance when recalling sad events in healthy subjects[ ]. The degree of metabolism enhancement in insular was associated with irritability[ ] and sleep disorders [ ] in MDD patients. Since different age-onset patients have different symptomatology[ ], the increased ReHo value of the right insular might be one of the underlying neural patterns for the clinical symptoms of LOD. \n\nWe also observed an abnormal ReHo value in the left supplementary motor area (SMA), left inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) and right middle occipital gyrus (MOG) in LOD patients. The decreased ReHo value of the SMA in LOD is consistent with a previous study[ ] that reported an increased ReHo value of the bilateral SMA in first-episode treatment-naive patients with late life depression (LLD). The occipital gyrus are components of the visual areas. Previous meta-analysis reported that the first-episode, drug-naive major depressive disorder patients showed decreased brain activity in numerous brain regions including the visual areas within the occipital lobe[ ]. In addition, previous study also revealed that the ReHo value alterations in occipital cortex in remitted geriatric depression[ ]. Taken together, these findings suggest that the abnormal spontaneous neural activity in the SMA, IOG and MOG might be associated with the pathophysiology mechanism of LOD. \n\nInterestingly, we observed increased ReHo value in the right frontoparietal regions (extend from the middle frontal gyrus to postcentral gyrus) in both patient groups compared to each control group. Previous studies exhibited the ReHo value increased in depression patients when compared with HC[ ,  ]. Liang et al. found the ReHo value of unipolar depression patients were increased in lots of brain regions when compare to HC, especially in the right inferior parietal lobule and the right precuneus[ ]. A previous study exhibited the blood flow of the back side of the bilateral parietal would increased according with the information complexity but the bilateral parietal blood flow would decline when the subjects were adopting the information[ ]. Thus, they speculated the ReHo value increased in parietal region of depression patients might lead to the ability of receiving new information and learning is decreased. Further, the frontoparietal region composes the frontoparietal network (FPN) that is involved in cognitive control of attention and emotion regulation. The FPN has been found to be impaired in major depression[ ]. A meta-analysis revealed that MDD was characterized by hypoconnectivity within the FPN, and associated with hyperconnectivity between frontoparietal control systems and regions of the DMN[ ]. Moreover, a significantly decreased connectivity in the bilateral frontoparietal regions in MDD compared to HC was also found in a previous study[ ], suggesting frontoparietal region might be a key region related to pathomechanism of depression. Meanwhile, the ReHo value was calculated depended on the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Vasic N et al. found that the rCBF increased in the frontoparietal and striatal regions in MDD patients, and the rCBF of the right middle frontal cortex was positively correlated with depressive symptoms[ ]. This finding strongly supported our observation of ReHo abnormalities in the right frontoparietal regions. Taken together, these data suggested that (1) MDD might characterized by dysfunction in frontoparietal network; (2) ReHo abnormalities in frontoparietal regions might be the appropriate brain regions to distinguish MDD from HC independent of onset age; (3) patients with MDD might have cognitive control problem or learning deficits associated with the frontoparietal regions independent of age of onset. \n\nIn brief, we used the ReHo method to analyze the regional neural activities in a group of first episode and drug-naive patients with MDD. We found different regional neural activity abnormalities between patients with EOD and patients with LOD, suggesting patients with different age-onset might have different pathomechanism. Furthermore, the regional ReHo abnormalities in the right frontoparietal regions might be the appropriate brain regions to distinguish MDD from HC independent of onset age. \n\nThere are several limitations of the present study. First, the psychological assessments were not conducted in the present study, therefore, we were unable to examine the relationship between the abnormal ReHo value and psychological assessments. Second, all patients were drug-naive, in their first-episode, and with short disease duration. A longitudinal study is needed to clarify whether the abnormal ReHo is stable after treatment. Third, some statistical maps that did not meet the combined threshold of p<0.05 (False Discovery Rate corrected) with cluster size >100 voxels but met a relaxed threshold of p<0.05 (uncorrected) with cluster size >100 voxels. Though these results may be a little exploratory, but these results would still be valuable to lighten the pathological mechanism between EOD and LOD. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone.0184712.t001\n### Label: Table 1\nVariables(mean\u00b1SD)\tHC\tUnnamed: 2\tMDD\tUnnamed: 4\tt(F)/\u03c72\tp-value\nSex(male/female)\t41/71\t\t42/78\t\t0.065\t0.891 ???\nAge (years)\t30.29\u00b16.99\t\t30.58\u00b17.41\t\t0.296\t0.768 ???\nYears of education\t15.42\u00b13.82\t\t12.18\u00b14.20\t\t-6.139\t0.000 ???\nHDRS score\t0.47\u00b10.69\t\t23.47\u00b14.54\t\t53.064\t0.000 ???\nGMV(mm3)\t619.11\u00b160.64\t\t608.68\u00b155.99\t\t-1.363\t0.580\n\tYoung HC\tOld HC\tEOD\tLOD\t\t\nSex(male/female)\t25/35\t16/36\t27/31\t15/47\t8.025\t0.046 ???\nAge (years)\t24.63\u00b12.37\t36.83\u00b14.33\t23.98\u00b12.89\t36.74\u00b14.38\t\\\t0.000 ???\nAge onset (years)\t\\\t\\\t23.23\u00b12.97\t36.06\u00b14.53\t\\\t0.000 ???\nIllness duration(months)\t\\\t\\\t8.98\u00b17.06\t8.24\u00b17.89\t0.539\t0.591 ???\nYears of education\t16.57\u00b12.34\t14.09\u00b14.71\t14.00\u00b13.41\t10.47\u00b14.17\t27.586\t0.000 ???\nHDRS score\t0.42\u00b10.65\t0.54\u00b10.75\t22.91\u00b14.19\t23.98\u00b14.82\t-1.295\t0.198 ???\nGMV(mm3)\t637.27\u00b160.14\t598.16\u00b154.64\t629.71\u00b151.61\t589.01\u00b153.05\t10.870\t0.000 ???\n### Caption\nThe demographics and clinical characteristics of the sample.\n### Footer\nMDD = major depressive disorder; EOD = early adult onset depression; LOD = later adult onset depression; HC = healthy control; HDRS = Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.a The p-value for sex distribution in the two groups was obtained by chi-square test.b The p-values were obtained by two sample t-test.c The p-values for sex distribution among the four groups was obtained by chi-square test p = 0.711(Young HC vs EOD), p = 0.432(Old HC vs LOD).d The p-values were obtained by one-way analysis of variance tests.

Other forms of love such as romantic or maternal attachment have previously been studied from a neuroimaging point of view. Here we aimed to investigate the neural basis of this tribal form of love, which implies both the feeling of belongingness and rivalry against opposing teams. A pool of 56 participants was submitted to an fMRI experimental design involving the presentation of winning and losing football moments of their loved, rival or neutral teams. We found recruitment of amygdala and reward regions, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN), as well as other limbic regions involved in emotional cognition, for \u2018positive   vs   neutral\u2019 and \u2018positive   vs   negative\u2019 conditions. The latter contrast was correlated with neuropsychological scores of fanaticism in the amygdala and regions within the reward system, as the VTA and SN. The observation of increased response patterns in critical components of the reward system, in particular for positive content related to the loved team, suggests that this kind of non-romantic love reflects a specific arousal and motivational state, which is biased for emotional learning of positive outcomes. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nRomantic and maternal love represent well-studied forms of passionate experience, with recognized biological and evolutionary relevance. Both imply a dual relationship in the formation of a bound between individuals ( ;  ;  ). Several studies established a coupling between both types of attachment processes and the neural systems underlying the experience of reward. The neural network mediating responses to gratifying stimuli, related to the goals that individuals seek, such as pleasure and motivation, is defined as the reward system. Motivational arousal is largely dependent on dopaminergic modulation ( ;  ). The mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine systems represent important pathways underlying processing of reward value and motivational function. These pathways stem from dopaminergic cells within the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The mesolimbic dopamine system comprises projections to the nucleus accumbens, but also to the amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex and septum. In the mesocortical dopamine system, medial VTA projects to the medial prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus and perirhinal cortex ( ). The nigrostriatal pathway provides modulatory influences from substantia nigra (SN) to caudate nucleus and putamen. Both romantic and maternal love have been shown to recruit these core systems underlying reward processing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nBonding and identification at the larger scale of a group level is very important in a broader social context. Feelings associated with group belongingness represent a sort of non-romantic love. Such feelings of belongingness can indeed be considered to form the core of a basic human need like food, water and shelter and are also deeply rooted in a human evolutionary context ( ). Several studies have demonstrated that loving attachment for in-group members, reflecting the sense of belongingness, is a general phenomenon. It biases empathy, altruistic and helping attitudes among diverse social groups, including race ( ;  ;  ), ethnicity ( ), political affiliation ( ) and even sports team allegiance ( ;  ). For reviews on the neuroscience of in-group biases, please see ( ) and ( ). \n\nA strong example of group identification, feeling of belongingness and loyalty is the passion for a football team, which may therefore be viewed as sort of tribal love. Desmond Morris described in an impactful book this tribal character of the link between, not only football players, coaches and directors, but between the fans and the teams. Football was described as a tribal phenomenon and the author framed in an evolutionary view how the attachment for a preferred football team and nation has achieved such significance for very large audiences ( ). The cognitive neuroscience of fan binding to a team is poorly studied from the neuroimaging point of view. Nevertheless, its social importance is irrefutable and the phenomenon of team love is worth deeper scientific investigation. \n\nThis issue is indeed relevant in the context of social neuroscience, given that sports have overwhelming socioeconomic impact in large communities worldwide. Concerning football, FIFA\u2019s 2014 financial report summarizes revenues of over 2 billion US dollars in that year ( ). In 2015, the amount spent in transfers of football players in the English premier league, reached 870 million pounds ( ). This reflects the enormous amount of time, energy and money that fans spend in their commitment to their beloved teams. This form of passionate behaviour is defined as a strong type of non-romantic love binding the fans to their team and they, as consumers, support the football teams and the leagues, leading to large-scale business models. \n\nDespite the neuroscientific and social relevance of this phenomenon, few studies address its neural underpinnings. The purpose of this work is to study this form of \u2018passionate love\u2019. \u2018Fanaticism\u2019 is not labelled as a negative term in this context. We rather assess it formally as the intensity of being a fan (as defined by a rating scale), leaving out any negative connotation or any relation to hooliganism or other dysfunctional behaviours. \n\nFootball can nurture a range of emotional feelings and behavioural patterns, which are, consciously or unconsciously, perceived by the supporters as needs. We hypothesize that these needs strongly modulate processing in the brain reward system as a function of the coding of the reward value of this particular social context. Reward processing has been studied using fMRI and PET in the study of hedonic responses to stimuli such as food ( ), drugs ( ) or love ( ;  ;  ). A critical question is whether the passion for a football team engages similar networks as the love for a person. \n\nTo answer this question we implemented a neuroimaging paradigm where participants, with formally defined levels of neuropsychological fanaticism scores, viewed memorable winning and losing football moments where their beloved team competed with rival/neutral teams. We hypothesized that these emotional experiences involve at least part of the same limbic regions that are recruited in other forms of love, and in particular the human reward system. A relevant question was which brain regions are recruited as a function of fanaticism. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nA pool of 61 football enthusiasts was recruited from the fan support organization of two Portuguese teams:   Futebol Clube do Porto   (henceforward labelled as Porto) and   Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra   (labelled as Acad\u00e9mica) as well as citizens that defined themselves as football fans (Porto or Acad\u00e9mica supporters), who were evaluated in terms of fanaticism scores. The two teams played in the Portuguese First League at the time of the study, Porto was one of the top ranked teams in the league and Acad\u00e9mica ranked at the bottom. \n\nSixty one subjects were recruited, of which 58 completed the scanning session. In total 2 out of 58 were excluded from this part of the study, given that debriefing revealed that they focused only on the technical aspects of the videos (one was a football player and the other person was a coach). In the functional imaging analysis 56 subjects were included (54 males and 2 females, aged from 21 to 60 years, mean age 34.4 \u00b1 10.7 years). Fifty-five out of 56 used the joystick in the right hand given their handedness. All the subjects had normal or corrected to normal vision. All subjects signed the informed consent of this study, which was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Coimbra, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Acquisition parameters \n  \nStructural and functional MRI scans were acquired in a 3T Magnetom Trio Tim MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), using a 12-channel head coil. A T1-weighted MPRAGE anatomical volume was measured with repetition time (TR) of 2530\u2009ms, echo time (TE) of 3.42\u2009ms, resolution 1\u2009mm , flip angle of 7\u00b0, matrix size 256 \u00d7 256, field of view of 256 \u00d7 256 and a slice thickness of 1\u2009mm. \n\nConsidering the regions of interest (ROIs) that were relevant for the present study, we were aware of the susceptibility artefact. To correct for this source of noise, we acquired gradient-echo field maps before each Echo Planar Imaging (EPI)-blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) sequence to map the distortions. Phase and magnitude field maps were acquired with the same orientation and the same field of view, TR of 3000\u2009ms, TE of 30\u2009ms, echo spacing 0.5\u2009ms, phase resolution 100%, phase encoding direction from anterior to posterior, TE difference of 2.46\u2009ms and bandwidth in the phase direction of 31.25\u2009Hz. \n\nFunctional data were acquired using EPI sequences, using slice thickness of 3\u2009mm and voxel size 4\u2009mm , 36 slices acquired parallel to the AC\u2013PC line, TR 3000\u2009ms, TE 30\u2009ms, flip angle of 90\u00b0, matrix size 256 \u00d7 256 and FOV of 256 \u00d7 256. In the whole session, two out of four runs were acquired for the study we present here. Both runs had 190 volumes. \n\nThe videos were rendered through a 698.40 \u00d7 392.85\u2009mm LCD monitor (NordicNeuroLab, Bergen, Norway) with a frequency rate of 60\u2009Hz, placed \u223c156\u2009cm away from the participants\u2019 head. Audio was provided through MR-compatible headphones. The subject could actively select the response using an MR-compatible joystick (Hybridmojo, San Mateo CA, USA). The participant used this device to move the cursor in the screen and pressed the button on its top to select his/her answer. \n\n\n### Task \n  \nParticipants underwent fMRI scans while they were watching short video streams of representative negative or positive goal situations in relation to the loved team or a rival team, or neutral (videos of Italian B-series teams, with high probability of being unknown). \n\nTo guarantee the consistency of visual content, all videos are exclusively rendered within the same framework of goal situations in football, with explicit exclusion of any images of actors such as fans or coaches and their reactions. All the videos presented a very similar scene content (a football field, movement of football players, which were the only actors, scored goals). All videos were resized to the 1280 \u00d7 720 aspect ratio. Despite all efforts made to keep the consistency of the visual content, the nature of the visual stimuli precluded an absolute matching in what refers to e.g. brightness or movement content. \n\nThe video collection was tailored to Porto fans and to Acad\u00e9mica fans and both included five videos of the favourite team\u2019s winning moments (labelled as +LovedTeam), five videos of winning moments of their favourite team against strong rival teams (\u2009++LovedTeam), five videos of the favourite team\u2019s losing moments (\u2212LovedTeam), five videos of losing moments of their favourite team against strong rival teams (--LovedTeam), five videos of rival team\u2019s winning moments (+RivalTeam), five videos of rival team\u2019s losing moments (\u2212RivalTeam) and five videos of Italian B-series teams (0Neutral: no fan related or antagonistic content). Henceforward, we will use the abbreviations as used in   to describe the conditions when specifying the contrasts. The blocks of videos were initiated by TR triggers and could last between 6 and 12\u2009s. The average duration of loved team\u2019s positive videos was 8.8\u2009s, while for negative videos was 9.0\u2009s. For the +RivalTeam, \u2212RivalTeam and 0Neutral, the average duration was respectively 9.2, 8.8 and 7.2\u2009seconds. The duration of each video was considered in the creation of the predictor\u2019s model as detailed further in this section.\n   \nAbbreviations and description of videos in each condition and theirs contents \n  \n\nThe participants were asked to classify each video in a - 3 to 3 Likert-like rating scale, right after the video presentation ( ). The participant underwent 2 EPIBOLD runs of 9.5 min each, of 17 and 18 videos, respectively. They contained at least two and up to three trials of each condition per run (overall five trials per condition). In total, 35 videos were presented in a randomized order. \n\n\n### Behavioural data \n  \nBefore the MRI session, the participants answered a questionnaire and completed the Football Supporter Fanaticism Scale (FSFS) ( ) (in Portuguese,   Escala de Fanatismo em Torcedores de   Futebol). This is a self-report scale assessing the level of fanaticism for football. This Likert scale was translated from Brazilian Portuguese to Portugal Portuguese by two experienced psychologists and verified by a third element, and used in a one to five ordinal range. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nGeometrical distortions were calculated based on the pixelshift algorithm and using Gradient field maps as input in the AnatAbacus v1.1 plugin ( ) for BrainVoyager QX to undistort the EPI-BOLD images. \n\nFunctional data were then pre-processed and analysed using BrainVoyager QX 2.8.2 (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands). Data were corrected for: (i) slice scanning time differences using cubic spline interpolation; (ii) for motion, combining trilinear and sinc function based methods for interpolation in the three axes (the second run was corrected in relation to the first volume of the first run); and (iii) filtered in the time domain using a General Linear Model (GLM) approach with Fourier basis set with two cycles per time course. The anatomical and functional data were co-registered (and manually verified) and then normalized according to the Talairach atlas. After the spatial normalization, spatial smoothing was performed using a Gaussian kernel of 8\u2009mm FWHW. A random effects (RFX) analysis was done at the group level using a GLM approach. The predictor\u2019s model was obtained by convolution of the boxcar time course (considering each video duration individually) with a two-gamma haemodynamic response function. A mask was obtained by averaging all functional files, automatically excluding bone and scalp. Eyes and cerebellum were manually extracted from the mask, using the information from the anatomical files. The RFX-GLM statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) ( ) with a fixed   P  -value lower than 0.01. \n\nCorrelation analysis was performed using the same software tool. Beta values, resulting from the RFX-GLM analysis, were correlated with an external covariate (FSFS individual scores). The resulting whole-brain maps containing   r  -values were corrected for multiple comparisons using cluster threshold levels with a p value of 0.006 and voxel extent, which estimation was based on Monte Carlo simulations (1000 iterations). Significant clusters include at least 78 contiguous voxels. \n\nVolumetric segmentation was performed with FreeSurfer 5.3 software which procedure is documented online ( ). The ROIs segmentation was based on an atlas of probabilistic information computed from a manually labelled dataset ( ;  ) based on the Duvernoy atlas ( ). The obtained ROIs of right and left amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, globus pallidus, putamen and thalamus of 10 subjects in native space were then transformed into Talairach space using the transform files created before in BrainVoyager QX 2.8. The resultant files were combined to extract peak voxels from the RFX statistical maps when contiguous clusters overlapped different anatomical regions. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioural results \n  \nConsidering the subjects that completed the functional study, 2 out of 56 had missing answers in the FSFS scale. Considering the 54 participants with complete assessments, the mean score was 3.19 \u00b1 0.95 (mean \u00b1 s.d.,   n   = 54). For this scale, we saw no differences [  t  -test,   t  (52) \u2264 2.01,   P   < 0.14, non-significant] between the sample of Porto fans (FSFS, mean score 3.38 \u00b1 1.07,   n   = 28) and the sample of Acad\u00e9mica fans (FSFS, mean score 2.99 \u00b1 0.67,   n   = 26). \n\nConsidering the pool of 56 subjects, video classification (in the Likert \u22123 to 3 scale) yielded the following results (condition mean \u00b1 s.d.): +LovedTeam 2.61 \u00b1 0.53; \u2009++LovedTeam 2.62 \u00b1 0.61; \u2212LovedTeam \u22121.81 \u00b1 1.14; --LovedTeam \u22122.27 \u00b1 1.14;\u2009+RivalTeam \u22121.01 \u00b1 1.27; -RivalTeam 0.87 \u00b1 1.27; 0Neutral \u22120.04 \u00b1 0.94. The negative videos (\u2212LovedTeam and --LovedTeam) resulted in different response levels, as revealed by a paired   t  -test   t  (55) = 5.1,   P   < 0.00001. However, the responses in the scale revealed that +LovedTeam and \u2009++LovedTeam conditions were quite similar, as revealed by a paired   t  -test   t  (55) = \u22120.17,   P   = 0.859, ns. \n\n\n### General random effects analysis \n  \nWe performed whole-brain group level RFX-GLM analysis [  t  (55) = 3.59,   P   < 0.01, FDR corrected] related to the visualization of positive and negative videos. The overall contrast of \u2018positive   vs   negative\u2019 moments (\u2009++LovedTeam and +LovedTeam   vs  . --LovedTeam and \u2212LovedTeam) revealed increased activity bilaterally in the inferior temporal lobe, amygdala, hippocampus, insula, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, VTA, SN and right caudate. This contrast also showed more activation in the left lingual gyrus and right inferior parietal lobule. The reverse contrast did not show areas of significant activity. See   and   for a complete overview of these results. \n  \nExperimental design. The paradigm had a box-car design. In the first block, the participants were watching video streams between 6 and 12\u2009s of goal situations. Then they were asked to rate the video \u22123 to 3 scale Likert-like rating scale. Each pair of video/response was followed by a baseline period which duration was jittered in time (randomly between 9 and 15\u2009s). The video presentation order was randomized. \n  \n  \nRegions significantly activated by the predictor contrast \u2018positive   vs   negative\u2019 \n    \n\nThe contrast of \u2018positive   vs   neutral\u2019 moments (\u2009++LovedTeam and +LovedTeam   vs   0Neutral, balanced as [1 1 \u22122]) showed the involvement of the inferior temporal lobe, right parahippocampus, right hippocampus, amygdala bilaterally, VTA and posterior cingulate. The reverse contrast showed increased activity in the auditory cortex, visual cortex and lingual gyrus [RFX,   t  (55) = 3.73,   P   < 0.01, FDR corrected]. Peak voxels are described in   (  provided as  ).\n   \nRegions significantly activated by the predictor contrast \u2018positive   vs   neutral\u2019 \n      \nRegions significantly activated by the predictor contrast \u2018negative   vs   neutral\u2019 \n     The contrast of \u2018negative vs neutral\u2019 moments [--LovedTeam and -LovedTeam   vs   0Neutral, balanced as (1 1 -2)] evidenced increased activity in middle temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal gyrus. The inverse contrast showed increased activity in the midcingulate, lingual gyrus and auditory cortex [RFX, t(55) =3.57, P < 0.01, FDR corrected]. See details in Table 4 ( ). The contrast of \u2018loved team's positive vs rival's negative moments\u2019 (+LovedTeam vs - RivalTeam, considered as directly positive and indirectly positive) showed more activation in the right inferior parietal lobule and right inferior frontal gyrus (See Figure 3 and Table 5). The reverse contrast evidenced increased activity in the left superior frontal gyrus [RFX, t(55)=4.28, P <0.01, FDR corrected]. \n\n\n### Correlation analysis of brain activity patterns and neuropsychological scores \n  \nWe performed a whole brain correlation analysis between beta values across regions and the FSFS individual scores. The correlation between the contrast of \u2018positive   vs   negative\u2019 moments (\u2009++LovedTeam and\u2009+LovedTeam   vs   --LovedTeam and \u2212LovedTeam) and the FSFS individual scores showed positive correlations in the inferior temporal lobe, amygdala, right insula, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, VTA and SN (  r   > 0.37 with   P   < 0.006, corrected). A negative correlation was found in the angular gyrus (BA 39). See   and   for a complete overview of these results. \n  \nSignificant BOLD activations for the \u2018positive   vs   negative\u2019 contrast. Sagittal and transversal slices show the regions activated in the whole-brain RFX-GLM analysis [  t  (55) = 3.59,   P   < 0.01, FDR corrected], overall contrasting\u2009++LovedTeam and +LovedTeam   vs   \u2013LovedTeam and --LovedTeam conditions. The group results are projected in a single subject\u2019s brain just for visualization purposes. The reverse contrast did not show areas of significant activity. Left = right. Green lines are only present to facilitate localization. \n    \nSignificant BOLD activations for the contrast of \u2018loved team\u2019s positive videos   vs   rival team\u2019s negative videos\u2019 (directly positive to the self because of positive affect   vs   indirectly positive to the self because of negative affect of rival fans). Sagittal views to show the regions activated in the whole-brain RFX-GLM analysis [  t  (55) = 4.28,   P   < 0.01, FDR corrected]. \n    \nCorrelation maps which were calculated by contrasting \u2018positive   vs   negative\u2019 moments and the fanaticism score. The contrast\u2009++LovedTeam and +LovedTeam   vs   \u2013LovedTeam and --LovedTeam was correlated with the FSFS individual scores in a whole-brain analysis (  r   > 0.37 with   P   < 0.006, corrected). Left = right. Green lines are only present to facilitate localization. \n  \n  \nRegions retrieved from the r-map \n    \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe aim of this work was to address the neural correlates of passionate attachment to a loved team, a sort of modern tribal love that is dissociable from romantic and maternal love. We found strong recruitment of reward regions including the brain stem, VTA and SN, as well as limbic regions involved in emotional cognition. Using neuropsychological team attachment scales we further found a significant correlation between regions that responded to positive states of team love with individual scores of fanaticism. \n\n### Reward value and love for the preferred competing team \n  \n  Reward system   . We expected that the positive content in the selected stimuli would activate motivational and reward related circuitry, reflecting the value attributed to the team affective attachment. Reward and motivational arousal are dopamine-dependent ( ;  ) which is well in line with the regions identified in our study. The dopamine-reward system, mediates the link between pleasure and motivation, in other words, the affective goals that individuals seek ( ) during emotionally loaded social contexts. \n\nA core network involving the VTA, SN, striatum (caudate, putamen and globus pallidus), insula, hippocampus and amygdala were shown to be activated by the contrast of \u2018positive   vs   negative\u2019 valence conditions. These are critical areas of the reward and affective processing systems mediating the perception of reward as well as for learning and processing of social reinforcement. \n\nTwo of the four major dopamine pathways in the brain, the the mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways, are particularly involved in motivational processing and receive strong influence from the dopaminergic VTA ( ). \n\nThe VTA, amygdala and hippocampus were all activated with both the contrasts of \u2018positive   vs   negative\u2019 and \u2018positive   vs   neutral\u2019 videos. These results suggest the engagement of the mesolimbic pathway during the visualization of positive situations involving the loved team. \n\nInterestingly, the cingulate gyrus and perirhinal cortex (included in the temporal clusters) were activated by both contrasts \u2018positive   vs   neutral\u2019 and \u2018negative   vs   neutral\u2019. This finding may be linked with the postulated suggestion that the mesocortical pathway is involved in reward processing both for conditions entailing positive reward and punishment. Moreover, the medial prefrontal cortex, which has a role in emotion regulation and it is also part of the mesocortical pathway, was activated by the contrast of \u2018negative   vs   neutral\u2019 conditions. This finding corroborates the notion that this region is important for cognitive control and appraisal of negative emotions ( ). Overall, these results support the notion that regions within the reward system are strongly involved in the processing of positive and negative valence stimuli in the context of non-romantic \u2018tribal\u2019 love for a football team. \n\nDespite the widespread interest in the study of the reward system in the context of social neuroscience, rare neuroimaging studies address the neurobehavioural correlates of sports fanaticism.  ) studied anticipatory pleasure (conditions: goals; missed chances; open play) in nine football supporters. The authors suggested that the anterior cingulate cortex is involved in cognitive aspects of pleasure processing, while the putamen was implicated in the anticipation of pleasure. Moreover, Cikara   et al   .   found that the anterior cingulate (and also insula) related to the processing of negative stimuli related to the participants\u2019 favourite team. They studied the neural effects of social group identity in sport (baseball fans) and they found the ventral striatum was strongly modulated by the processing of positive stimuli. Interestingly, this effect was found to be correlated with self-reported desire to aggress against outgroup members.   assessed 23 basketball fans in a study of emotional memory. Before the fMRI session, the fans watched a game with the rival team. Then, while they were scanned, they reviewed short videos which ended in the moment that the ball was released towards the basket. The participants had to recall whether or not the ball went into the basket, as well as the confidence on that answer and the emotional valence of that clip. Results showed that such memory retrieval activated dorsal frontoparietal regions. Memories retrieved with high confidence additionally recruited insula and the medial temporal lobe ( ). These studies did not emphasize the affective and social neuroscientific aspects of team love. \n\n  Tribal (in-group)   vs   individual maternal/partner love bonds.    Neuroimaging studies directly addressing in-group (tribal)   vs   out-group behaviour are also sparse in the literature. Moreover, to our knowledge, there is no previous work studying the neural correlates of in-group non-romantic love in relation to the concept of a strong affective link supporting the tendency to favour the in-group (tribal)   vs   out-group members ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The present results are therefore worth discussing within the context of other forms of inter-individual bonding such as maternal and romantic love. \n\nOur results show striking similarities with the neural underpinnings of maternal love and romantic love as described by  ,  ). Activation of the insula, striatum (putamen, caudate and globus pallidus), thalamus, SN/VTA were also found in our study.  ) studied long-term romantic love and also identified a similar core network (SN/VTA, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, insula, hippocampus and amygdala). The results suggest that the passionate behaviour experienced by football fans involves a similar core of key neural structures underlying reward and affective processing. The reward value taken from the vivid football moments can act as the motivational \u2018glue\u2019 that keeps the in-group cohesion suggested by other studies. \n\nHowever, we did not find the pattern of deactivation that was identified in studies of romantic and maternal love, namely in the amygdaloid cortex, posterior cingulate, middle temporal cortex and lateral prefrontal ( ,  ). Importantly, in the present study, the amygdala showed increased activity in the contrasts \u2018positive   vs   negative\u2019 and \u2018positive   vs   neutral\u2019, and the posterior cingulate showed increased activity in both \u2018positive   vs   neutral\u2019 and \u2018negative   vs   neutral\u2019 contrasts. The positive involvement of posterior cingulate was expected due to the memory content and limbic processing likely triggered by positive and negative content. The fact that amygdala activation was biased for positive valence stimuli is further discussed in \u2018Activation in the reward system is modulated by the level of fanaticism\u2019 section. \n\nLangeslag and colleagues used an oddball task with pictures of the participants\u2019 loved partners and friends (serving as target and distractor stimuli alternately) to examine how attention modulates the response in regions consistently found in studies concerning romantic love. The results suggested that the dorsal striatum is not activated by romantic information per se, but only when such information is attended to ( ). A study of the neural correlates of hate showed that both the insula and putamen are also activated in addition to romantic love studies ( ). The present paradigm supports the notion of a common architecture of processing of love related information but also important distinctions underlying passionate attachment to a team. \n\n  In-group love   vs   out-group hate.    The contrast of \u2018loved team\u2019s positive   v   s   rival\u2019s negative\u2019 moments (direct self-oriented positive affect   vs   indirect positive affect possibly triggered by negative rival outcomes) showed larger activation in the right inferior parietal lobule and right inferior frontal gyrus, which belong to the mirror neuron system. Decreased activity was found in the left superior frontal gyrus. Decreases in the superior frontal gyrus were found to be associated to favourite brand content in a decision task ( ). Mirror neuron system networks located in the inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) and the inferior frontal gyrus (BA44) are thought to support self-relevant perception-action loops ( ;  ). An fMRI study has accordingly shown that group membership can modulate the neural activity in the inferior parietal lobule ( ).  ) suggested that this result is possibly due to the fact that the human brain simulates the actions of in-group members more easily than the out-group members\u2019 actions. Our results of the contrast of \u2018loved team\u2019s positive   v   s   rival\u2019s negative\u2019 moments corroborate this view ( ). \n   \nRegions revealed by the contrast of \u2018loved team\u2019s positive   vs   rival\u2019s negative\u2019 moments \n    \n\nOutgroup hate is a commonly perceived counterpart of in-group love, and such types of negative feelings are very common in football fans (e.g. Manchester United   vs   Manchester City). A neurobehavioural response can therefore be triggered, as suggested by our data, by the negative videos for the rival team, which could possibly generate \u2018unfair\u2019 positive feelings in football fans. \n\n\n### The role of the amygdala \n  \n  Amygdala activation for positive videos.    The amygdala has been consistently reported to be engaged in situations of negative emotions, fear and aggression. Concerning the studies of love, Bartels and colleague found that the amygdaloid region (left in the whole group and bilateral in the female group) showed evidence for deactivation when contrasting conditions when participants viewed loved partner\u2019s photos   vs   friends\u2019 photos ( ). A similar bilateral deactivating pattern in amygdala was found by others ( ;  ), while Acevedo and colleagues suggested that the right amygdala deactivates in early-stage love, while the left amygdala activates in long-term love ( ). A study on maternal love showed a similar bilateral pattern of deactivation when viewing pictures of one\u2019s own child as compared with pictures of a child acquaintance ( ). Intriguingly,  ) suggested that poorer quality of the maternal experience is related to decreases in the amygdala response, as tested by using a similar paradigm of viewing own and unfamiliar child\u2019s pictures. A racial in-group   vs   out-group study found differential responses in the amygdala, which showed decreased activity for viewing in-group members\u2019 faces when compared with viewing out-group faces ( ). Importantly, this difference in amygdala activity was shown to be correlated with implicit measures of racial bias ( ). \n\nA meta-analysis about reward processing in obesity and substance addiction provided clear evidence that the affected participants showed amygdala hyperactivity when processing rewarding stimuli, either general or related with the problematic condition ( ). Another review confirmed the view that the amygdala is involved in the processing of both appetitive and aversive stimuli ( ). \n\nIt is also known that amygdala plays a role in the recognition of faces in general ( ). The role of the amygdala in affective social cognition and love, either romantic, maternal and in-group love seems therefore to be distinct, raising questions about differential nature of content-related processing biases. \n\n  Amygdala, the reward system and emotional memory.    The reward system is considered an ancient structure from an evolutionary perspective, due to its fundamental role on the regulation of behaviours that are associated with its value. This implies that the structures that are part of this system engage in a type of processing that, although not purely mnemonic in nature, is crucial for emotional memory, as affective arousal enhances memory consolidation. Interestingly, the contrast results of \u2018positive   vs   negative\u2019 valent conditions showed a pattern of changes largely overlapping the neural network of the human reward system. This result reinforces the notion that the positive videos of football are perceived as positive input stimuli, generating emotional arousal, and are then interpreted as a \u2018to repeat\u2019 (reinforced) pattern while it is memorized, engaging the reward system with differential weights concerning positive   vs   negative stimuli. The amygdala can have a facilitator role in emotional mnemonic processes in the assessment of positive rewarding stimuli, by reinforcing behaviours of positive payoff rather than negative ones. We suggest that, in this study, as it receives input from the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, the amygdala plays a role in emotional arousal and learning by processing motivationally relevant information, preferentially in positive valence conditions. The finding of a correlation between the contrast of \u2018positive   v   s   negative\u2019 with the fan assessment score (FSFS) in the amygdala, as well as in structures of the reward system, supports this conceptual framework. \n\n\n### Activation in the reward system is modulated by the level of fanaticism \n  \nRFX analysis showed that viewing images of intense moments of participants\u2019 loved team engages classical dopaminergic reward regions. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between the contrast of \u2018positive   vs   negative\u2019 with the fanaticism score (FSFS) in the amygdala, inferior temporal lobe, parahippocampus, right insula, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, VTA and SN. Hence, the individual FSFS score partially explains the variance of BOLD differences between positive and negative conditions in these regions. So higher the fanaticism score, higher the modulation of the BOLD signal as a function of positive content. \n\nThe most fanatic participants, besides reporting their football experiences differently, do actually experience football moments differently as evidenced by this type of analysis. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe investigated the neural basis of the love for a football team as a type of tribal attachment. We found the involvement of the amygdala and reward system regions such as VTA and SN in the processing of this type of affect. The observation of an increased response bias in these areas preferentially to positive stimuli of the loved team suggests that this kind of non-romantic love represents a strong motivational state, with a bias for processing positive content. The amygdala is proposed to have a facilitator role in emotional mnemonic processes in the assessment of positive rewarding stimuli, reinforcing behaviours of positive outcome rather than negative ones. Furthermore, fanaticism scores were strongly associated with individual response differences elicited by positive   vs   negative affective in-group experiences, thus implicating a weighting bias concerning neural responses for reward   vs   punishment. \n\n\n## Supplementary data \n  \n are available at   SCAN   online. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: nsx003-T1\n### Label: Table 1.\nAbbreviation\tVideo\tValence on fan\u2019s perspective\tLoved team present?\tStrong Rival team present?\n+LovedTeam\tPositive for loved team\tpositive\tyes\tno\n++LovedTeam\tPositive for loved team against the rival\tpositive\tyes\tyes\n\u2212LovedTeam\tNegative for loved team\tnegative\tyes\tno\n\u2212\u2212Loved Team\tNegative for loved team against the rival\tnegative\tyes\tyes\n+RivalTeam\tPositive for rival team\tnegative or neutral\tNo\tyes\n\u2212RivalTeam\tNegative for rival team\tpositive or neutral\tNo\tyes\n0Neutral\tNeutral\tneutral\tno\tno\n### Caption\nAbbreviations and description of videos in each condition and theirs contents\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: nsx003-T2\n### Label: Table 2.\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tUnnamed: 1_level_0\tpeak\tpeak\tpeak\tUnnamed: 5_level_0\tUnnamed: 6_level_0\tUnnamed: 7_level_0\nregion\tH\tx\ty\tz\tt\tp\tn\namygdala\tL\t\u221227\t\u22124\t\u221210\t5.4\t0.000002\t22\namygdala\tR\t24\t\u22127\t\u22128\t5.2\t0.000003\t9\nhippocampus\tL\t\u221218\t\u221213\t\u221210\t4.8\t0.000013\t11\nhippocampus\tR\t21\t\u221213\t\u22129\t4.7\t0.000016\t17\ncaudate\tR\t8\t\u22121\t10\t4.3\t0.000065\t4\nglobus pallidus\tL\t\u221224\t\u22127\t\u22124\t4.7\t0.000016\t11\nglobus pallidus\tR\t25\t\u221212\t\u22123\t4.7\t0.000020\t8\nputamen\tL\t\u221229\t\u22127\t\u22125\t4.9\t0.000009\t82\nputamen\tR\t30\t\u221217\t\u22122\t5.1\t0.000004\t48\nstriatum\tR,L\t0\t\u22124\t10\t5.3\t0.000002\t7\nthalamus\tL\t\u22126\t\u221225\t7\t4.9\t0.000010\t28\nthalamus\tR\t3\t\u22126\t10\t4.8\t0.000012\t41\nVTA and SN\tR,L\t20\t\u221213\t\u22126\t5.0\t0.000006\t13\ninferior parietal lobule (BA 40)\tR\t60\t\u221237\t19\t5.8\t<0.000001\t93\ninsula\tR\t42\t5\t4\t5.3\t0.000002\t89\ninsula\tL\t\u221233\t2\t16\t5.0\t0.000007\t69\ninferior frontal gyrus (BA 44)\tR\t61\t5\t10\t5.2\t0.000003\t27\nlingual\tL\t\u22129\t\u221258\t\u22128\t4.8\t0.000011\t192\ninferior temporal lobe\tR\t36\t\u221219\t\u22125\t5.2\t0.000003\t220\ninferior temporal lobe\tL\t\u221233\t\u22121\t\u221211\t5.2\t0.000003\t50\n### Caption\nRegions significantly activated by the predictor contrast \u2018positive vs negative\u2019\n### Footer\nRegions were identified from a whole-brain RFX-GLM analysis [t(55) = 3.59, P < 0.01, FDR corrected).

Previous research has identified brain regions supporting person evaluations, but are evaluations based on perceptual cues versus person-knowledge processed differently? Moreover, are neural responses consistent when person-knowledge is available but unnecessary for the evaluation? This fMRI study examined how the use and availability of person-knowledge shapes the neural underpinnings of social evaluations. Participants evaluated well-known actors based on attractiveness or body of work (i.e., person-knowledge) and unknown models based on attractiveness only. Analyses focused on the VMPFC, following research implicating this region in positive evaluations based on person-knowledge. The VMPFC was sensitive to the (1) availability of person-knowledge, showing greater responses as ratings became more positive for actors (but not models) regardless of rating dimension and (2) use of available person-knowledge, showing greater activity as ratings for likability based on body of work became more positive for actors versus models rated on attractiveness. These findings indicate that although brain regions supporting person evaluation are sensitive to the availability to person-knowledge, they are even more responsive when judgments require the use of available person-knowledge. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nWe can efficiently form impressions of others based on a multitude of perceptual characteristics. For example, our evaluations can be based on perceptual cues conveying social traits  or group membership . Although evaluations based on perceptual cues are efficient  and ubiquitous , the availability of person-knowledge (i.e., target-specific biographical information) allows more individualized evaluations . Conceptually, these two sources of knowledge are thought to be processed simultaneously and interactively . \n\nAlthough the majority of social neuroscience research focuses on how perceptual cues alone affect evaluations , a few studies have compared social judgments based on the simultaneous presentation or use of both perceptual cues and person-knowledge . These studies have primarily examined perceived consistency of appearance-behavior pairings  or the impact of perceptual and knowledge-based familiarity on face perception . One transcranial magnetic stimulation study reported a causal role for the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) in processing new information about faces previously paired with positive and negative person-knowledge . In that study, participants formed impressions of congruent face-behavior pairs (e.g., a trustworthy face paired with sentences conveying positive behaviors) and then indicated whether their impressions were consistent with subsequently presented trait words. Researchers found that the DMPFC played a causal role in updating impressions based on new person-knowledge . Other research suggests that such sensitivity to valenced person-knowledge in the DMPFC is relatively spontaneous . \n\nImportantly, theoretical and empirical work suggests that more ventral aspects of the medial prefrontal cortex (e.g., VMPFC) may more directly index increasingly positive explicit evaluations of others  compared to the DMPFC. In the present study, we therefore examined activity in the VMPFC and other exploratory regions (e.g., DMPFC) as participants explicitly evaluated people based on (1) perceptual cues or person-knowledge when such knowledge was available (e.g., for known actors) or (2) perceptual cues only when person-knowledge was unavailable (e.g., for unknown models). A direct examination of percept- and knowledge-based forms of explicit evaluations, both independent of one another and in combination, is necessary to the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the neural processes supporting person evaluations. Although both kinds of evaluations may indeed recruit a similar set of brain regions, novel insights into person evaluation can be gained by identifying (1) the relative impact of percept- versus knowledge-based information on regions supporting explicit person evaluations, (2) the convergences and divergences in regions across this network (e.g., VMPFC vs. DMPFC), and (3) the combined impact when both percept- and knowledge-based information are present. \n\n\n## Perceptual Cues \n  \nPerceptual cues provide valuable information that can be gleaned just from looking at another person. For example, we can often gather information about someone\u2019s socioeconomic status via clothing, dominance via physical size, or trustworthiness via facial expression . Many neuroimaging studies on person evaluation have focused on novel faces lacking prior knowledge associations . Irrespective of accuracy, perceptual cues frequently guide evaluations as they are often the only or most salient source of social information . \n\nPast research has implicated different neural regions in various percept-based evaluations. For example, the amygdala is frequently implicated in studies involving race , valence of emotional expressions , or trustworthiness based on facial cues . Some regions have been shown to respond to variations in attractiveness. For example, the ventral striatum has been shown to be involved in reward processing and positive attractiveness ratings . To a lesser extent than the amygdala and ventral striatum, the VMPFC has also been shown to be sensitive to positive evaluations of others (e.g., positive ratings of facial attractiveness) . \n\n\n## Person-knowledge \n  \nAlthough evaluations based solely on perceptual cues (e.g., attractiveness) are efficient, we also evaluate others based on person-knowledge , often leading to more complex individuated impressions . In the present study, we examined brain regions associated with the availability and use of person-knowledge during explicit evaluations. Specifically, we were interested in whether these processes are supported more by the DMPFC or VMPFC. The DMPFC has been implicated in various aspects of thinking about people including the retrieval of person-knowledge , the formation and updating of impressions , and mentalizing . The VMPFC is also believed to support relatively explicit social evaluations based on person-knowledge, with typically greater activity for positively evaluated people . Consistent with its sensitivity to both social and evaluative information , meta-analyses and reviews of the literature purport that the VMPFC more broadly supports the flexible generation of affective meaning by integrating evaluation-relevant information from multiple dimensions and time points . In other words, the VMPFC is suggested to support the process of combining current environmental cues and past knowledge, possibly to predict future outcomes. In the context of person evaluation, the VMPFC is sensitive to explicit positive evaluations based on previous knowledge . For example, greater VMPFC activity is observed when person-knowledge about someone\u2019s high compared to low moral status is available . Moreover, the VMPFC is sensitive to personally relevant and well-liked individuals about whom perceivers have extensive knowledge . Based on previous research implicating the VMPFC in explicit evaluations solely from perceptual cues  or solely from person-knowledge , we focused on this region as our primary region of interest (ROI). We anticipated that the VMPFC may be particularly involved in person evaluations based on the simultaneous presentation of both types of information. \n\n\n## Study overview \n  \nIn the current event-related fMRI investigation, we examined how the availability and use of person-knowledge shapes neural responses during percept- and knowledge-based evaluations. Specifically, participants evaluated: (1) unknown models on attractiveness (i.e., absence of person-knowledge), (2) well-known actors on attractiveness (i.e., availability of person-knowledge that is irrelevant to evaluations), and (3) well-known actors on likability based on body of work (i.e., availability of person-knowledge is required for evaluations). We focus on attractiveness and body of work because these two dimensions best allow us to differentiate the influence of perceptual cues and person-knowledge. Attractiveness judgments can be made based solely on perceptual cues and in the absence of person-knowledge (e.g., unfamiliar models). However, even if person-knowledge is available, one can presumably assess attractiveness based on perceptual cues without being influenced by person-knowledge (e.g., familiar actors). On the other hand, body-of-work judgments rely on person-knowledge and should not depend on attractiveness. We first examined the relative impact of the absence, mere availability, and use of person-knowledge during deliberative evaluations by identifying potential increases in VMPFC activity in response to increasingly positive physical-based evaluations of models (i.e., attractiveness), increasingly positive physical-based evaluations of actors (i.e., attractiveness), and increasingly positive knowledge-based evaluations of actors (i.e., likability based on body of work), respectively. We additionally compared each of the three conditions to each other to determine whether the relationship between positive ratings and VMPFC activity was especially pronounced for a given form of person evaluation. \n\n### Predictions \n  \nBased on previous research , we anticipated that the VMPFC would generally respond to targets associated with relatively positive (vs. negative) evaluations regardless of rating dimension (i.e., body of work vs. attractiveness). Additionally, the VMPFC may be sensitive to positive evaluations when person-knowledge is available (vs. not available). Specifically, we predicted preferential activity following positive evaluations when person-knowledge is either available (viz., evaluating the physical attractiveness or body of work for well-known actors) or required during person evaluation (viz., evaluating actor likeability vis-a-vis their body of work). In other words, we expected the VMPFC to be more involved when evaluating actors more positively regardless of rating dimension compared to when evaluating models more positively based on attractiveness. Lastly, the VMPFC may be particularly sensitive to positive evaluations when person-knowledge is required. Specifically, we predicted preferential recruitment of the VMPFC when evaluating actors based on person-knowledge (i.e., likeability vis-\u00e0-vis their body of work) versus perceptual cues (i.e., attractiveness). \n\nBecause it has also been implicated in the relatively more spontaneous retrieval of person-knowledge , we also explored neural responses to the availability and use of person-knowledge in the DMPFC. We anticipated that this region may be particularly sensitive to the availability of person-knowledge when it is not explicitly required for evaluations. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### ROI analyses \n  \nOur primary analyses focused on the VMPFC as our a priori ROI. We conducted exploratory analyses for other regions relevant to person evaluation, including the DMPFC. Because all effects in the DMPFC were non-significant, we report only results from the VMPFC here. (See Supplementary Material\u00a0  for full results from all exploratory ROIs.) \n\n#### Do evaluations based on person-knowledge or attractiveness modulate VMPFC activity? \n  \nWe first examined whether increased positive evaluations led to greater VMPFC activity when those evaluations were based on (1) perceptual cues without person-knowledge (i.e., models rated on attractiveness), (2) perceptual cues with available person-knowledge (i.e., actors rated on attractiveness), and (3) person-knowledge (i.e., actors rated on body of work). Ratings provided in the scanner were included as parametric predictors separately for each of the three conditions in our design (see Materials and Methods). We then conducted separate one-sample t-tests on parameter estimates for each of the three parametric predictors (i.e., models rated on attractiveness, actors rated on attractiveness, and actors rated on likability based on body of work) compared to zero. This analysis was conducted to examine the potential involvement of the VMPFC in supporting positive ratings within each condition separately. \n\nWe observed a significant VMPFC involvement for evaluations based on perceptual cues with available person-knowledge (i.e., actors rated on attractiveness),   t  (54)\u2009=\u20092.672,   p  \u2009=\u20090.010, such that VMPFC activity increased as ratings of attractiveness for actors became more positive. We also observed significant VMPFC involvement for evaluations based on person-knowledge (i.e., actors rated on likability based on body of work),   t  (54)\u2009=\u20093.660,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, such that VMPFC activity increased as ratings of likability based on body of work became more positive. However, we did not observe a significant VMPFC involvement for percept-based evaluations made in the absence of person-knowledge (viz., models rated on attractiveness),   t  (54)\u2009=\u20090.678,   p  \u2009=\u20090.501. Taken together, these results indicate that the VMPFC is sensitive to positive evaluations when person-knowledge is available, irrespective of whether that person-knowledge is directly relevant to evaluations. \n\n\n#### Do person evaluations modulate VMPFC activity more when person-knowledge is used or when it\u2019s simply available? \n  \nTo examine whether sensitivity to positive ratings was especially pronounced for a particular condition (e.g., use of person-knowledge: actors\u2019 body of work) relative to other conditions (e.g., mere presence of person-knowledge: actors\u2019 attractiveness), we next conducted a one-way ANOVA on parameter estimates to detect the presence of any differences amongst the parametric predictors. \n\nThe results indicated that the parametric predictors differed in magnitude: significant effect of parametric predictor on VMPFC activity,   F  (2,162)\u2009=\u20093.479,   p  \u2009=\u20090.033. We followed up on this finding by conducting linear regressions to test all possible pair-wise contrasts between the parametric predictors. We found evidence of a significant linear relationship between positive ratings and the combined availability/use of person-knowledge (contrast codes: parametric predictor for actors\u2019 body of work\u2009=\u20090.5, parametric predictor for actors\u2019 attractiveness\u2009=\u20090, and parametric predictor for models\u2019 attractiveness\u2009=\u2009\u22120.5),   b  \u2009=\u20090.753,   SE  \u2009=\u20090.288,   CI  \u2009=\u2009[0.188, 1.317],   F  (1,163)\u2009=\u20096.833,   p  \u2009=\u20090.010. Specifically, VMPFC activity increased more as ratings of likability based on body of work for actors became more positive compared to when ratings of attractiveness for models became more positive. No other significant differences emerged: (1) ratings of likability based on body of work for actors compared to ratings of attractiveness for actors,   b  \u2009=\u20090.276,   SE  \u2009=\u20090.293,   CI  \u2009=\u2009[\u22120.298, 0.851],   F  (1,163)\u2009=\u20090.889,   p  \u2009=\u20090.347; and (2) ratings of attractiveness for actors compared to ratings of attractiveness for models,   b  \u2009=\u20090.477,   SE  \u2009=\u20090.292,   CI  \u2009=\u2009[\u22120.095, 1.048],   F  (1,163)\u2009=\u20092.670,   p  \u2009=\u20090.104. Taken together, these results indicate that the VMPFC is particularly sensitive to the use of available person-knowledge relative to the absence of person-knowledge (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nMagnitude of parametric modulation of VMPFC activity by positive ratings, plotted by condition. We conducted pair-wise contrasts of VMPFC parameter estimates for the parametric predictors when participants were rating actors on likability based on body of work (i.e., person-knowledge available and necessary), actors on attractiveness (i.e., person-knowledge available and unnecessary), and models on attractiveness (i.e., person-knowledge unavailable and unnecessary). Results indicate that VMPFC activity is particularly sensitive to the use of available person-knowledge relative to the absence of person-knowledge. The significant simple effect (*) is indicated,   p  \u2009=\u20090.010. All other pair-wise contrasts were non-significant,   p  \u2009>\u20090.104. \n  \n\n\n\n### Exploratory whole-brain analyses \n  \nComplementing our a priori focus on the VMPFC, we conducted exploratory whole-brain analyses to determine whether (1) any other regions (e.g., DMPFC) would show a similar pattern of activity to that observed in the VMPFC ROI and (2) the activity observed in our a priori ROI analysis would be robust to multiple comparison correction at the whole-brain level. \n\n#### Analysis parameters \n  \nSeparate whole-brain analyses at the second level were performed to examine increases and decreases in neural activity as a function of in-scanner ratings provided during each of the three conditions: (1) actors rated on body of work, (2) actors rated on attractiveness, and (3) models rated on attractiveness. Using the Monte Carlo simulations included in AlphaSim, the minimum cluster size required for a whole-brain correction at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 with an uncorrected threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 was estimated to be 51 contiguous voxels. We summarize results from each of the whole-brain analyses below. The results for all analyses are reported in Table\u00a0 .   \nIdentification of BOLD signal as a function of Rating Dimension and Person-Knowledge. \n  \n Note  . Exploratory whole-brain analysis of 55 participants (threshold\u2009=\u2009  p  \u2009<\u20090.001, uncorrected; clusters \u226551 voxels determined by AlphaSim; actual values are reported in the table). \n  \n\n\n#### Impact of person-knowledge use (actors rated on body of work only) \n  \nWe observed greater activity in the calcarine sulcus, VMPFC, and superior occipital cortex as body-of-work ratings increased for the actors, but no reliable changes as body-of-work ratings decreased (Fig.\u00a0 ). These findings converge with the ROI findings reported above showing that VMPFC activity was sensitive to increasing positivity in body-of-work ratings for well-known actors.   \nBrain regions associated with increases in body-of-work likability ratings for actors. The results of this exploratory whole-brain analysis are displayed on a sagittal section, x\u2009=\u20096 mm. Increased body-of-work ratings for the actors were associated with increasing activity in the VMPFC (peak MNI \u2009=\u2009[6, 63, 0]). \n  \n\n\n#### Impact of person-knowledge availability (actors rated on attractiveness only) \n  \nWe observed greater activity in the lingual gyrus as attractiveness ratings increased for the actors, but no reliable changes as attractiveness ratings decreased. Although the VMPFC was reliably modulated by increasingly positive ratings of actor attractiveness in our reported ROI analyses, this region did not survive thresholds for multiple comparison in this corresponding whole-brain analysis. \n\n\n#### Impact of percept-based evaluations without person-knowledge (models rated on attractiveness only) \n  \nWe observed greater activity in the superior parietal gyrus as attractiveness ratings decreased for the actors, but no reliable changes as attractiveness ratings increased. \n\n\n\n### Supplementary Analyses Controlling for Post-scan Stimulus Familiarity \n  \nIn order to see if differences in perceptual familiarity (and not differences in person-knowledge, as hypothesized) could account for differences arising between comparisons of actors and models rated on attractiveness, we conducted analyses while controlling for post-scan familiarity ratings in Supplementary Material\u00a0 . Specifically, we re-analyzed the ROI data while accounting for post-scan familiarity ratings as a parametric modulator in the level-1 GLM. Results from these analyses were consistent with the corresponding original ROI analyses reported in the main text and Supplementary Material\u00a0 , suggesting that perceptual familiarity is unlikely to account for these differences. \n\nFinally, in order to account for post-scan ratings of familiarity in the whole-brain exploratory analyses reported in the preceding section, we also re-analyzed these data while accounting for post-scan familiarity ratings as an additional parametric modulator in the level-1 GLM for each of the three whole-brain parametric analyses (see Supplementary Material\u00a0 ). With the exception of clusters in the parietal cortex (see Supplementary Material\u00a0 ), results from the whole brain analyses were consistent with the whole-brain findings reported in the preceding section (cf. Table\u00a0  and Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### General Discussion \n  \nThe goal of the current study was to examine how VMPFC activity is impacted by the availability and use of person-knowledge. Our findings indicate that the VMPFC is especially sensitive to the use of available person-knowledge but also to a lesser extent to the availability of person-knowledge. Moreover, person-knowledge may be spontaneously used in evaluations of others even when such knowledge is not necessary for the task at hand, such as when judging familiar people based on their attractiveness. Although existing research has implicated the VMPFC in explicitly assessed positive evaluations based on person-knowledge and, to a lesser extent, based on perceptual cues, these two forms of explicit evaluation have not been directly compared in a single brain imaging study. \n\nImportantly, our predictions for the involvement of the VMPFC in positive explicit evaluations when person-knowledge was available were confirmed. VMPFC was more involved in increasingly positive evaluations when person-knowledge was required compared to when person-knowledge was unavailable. Although VMPFC activity also tracked with increasingly positive evaluations when person-knowledge was available but not necessary for evaluation, the magnitude of this relationship did not differ relative to the non-significant relationship between VMPFC activity and positive evaluations in the absence of person-knowledge. In contrast, our prediction that the VMPFC would be involved in positively evaluating others regardless of person-knowledge availability was not supported. It appears that the VMPFC may be less involved in evaluations of others based solely on perceptual cues in the absence of person-knowledge. \n\nThere are several key take-aways from these findings. First, results suggest that when person-knowledge is available it influences how we evaluate others, even when the knowledge in question is not necessary for the judgment at hand. Second, VMPFC may be particularly involved in the implementation of person evaluations requiring the use of person-knowledge. Third, the current findings suggest that contributions from the VMPFC to explicit evaluations critically depend on the presence of person-knowledge. In other words, this region does not appear to support positive evaluations based on a perceptual attribute in the absence of person-knowledge. Finally, these effects were observed in the VMPFC, but not the DMPFC (see Supplementary Material\u00a0 ), illustrating an important divergence in the medial prefrontal cortex during explicit social evaluations, at least when person-knowledge is available. \n\nConsistent with previous research, the VMPFC is not always sensitive to attractiveness in the absence of person-knowledge . Indeed, with respect to attractiveness ratings, the VMPFC only showed enhanced sensitivity to ratings of attractiveness when person-knowledge about the targets was available (i.e., actors). These results provide further evidence of an extended neural system supporting the various aspects of person perception . In particular, the VMPFC may be spontaneously sensitive to the availability of person-knowledge, even when that person-knowledge is not needed (e.g., when evaluating the attractiveness of familiar actors). \n\nThe VMPFC\u2019s spontaneous sensitivity to person-knowledge during social evaluations is noteworthy given evidence that the DMPFC may also be involved in the spontaneous use of person-knowledge. However, one key difference is that the present study involved explicit evaluations. With few exceptions , studies finding sensitivity in the DMPFC to valenced person-knowledge have tended to rely on indirect comparisons. At least during the critical contrasts reported in these studies, person-knowledge was not used for direct and explicit evaluations (e.g., impression consistency judgments , n-back task ). Even when critical analyses involve explicit evaluations, the DMPFC is not directly sensitive to increasingly positive evaluations of others. Instead, the DMPFC appears to be sensitive to evaluative inconsistency  or impression updating based on evaluatively inconsistent information . For studies reporting DMPFC sensitivity to impression updating as a function of the valence of new information, the DMPFC is either not sensitive to valence  or shows increased activity to increasingly   negative   impression updating . This contrasts with the present finding that activity in the VMPFC (but not the DMPFC) tracks increasingly   positive   evaluations based on person-knowledge. Rather than directly indexing the valence of explicit evaluations based on person-knowledge as in the VMPFC, we speculate that the DMPFC is sensitive to potentially diagnostic person-knowledge that conflicts with an existing impression. Because participants in this study were not systematically presented with evaluatively inconsistent information (e.g., unattractive actors whose body of work is nonetheless impressive), it is perhaps to be expected that we did not observe activity in the DMPFC as a function of explicit evaluations or otherwise. \n\nThe present study also raises the question of whether the VMPFC is involved in the integration of the evaluative impact of perceptual and knowledge-based cues on social evaluations even when one or more of these cues are irrelevant to the explicit evaluation at hand. To better understand whether perceptual and knowledge-based information are integrated (vs. processed in parallel) in the VMPFC, future work will need to examine these processes in a more orthogonal fashion. For example, evaluating actors\u2019 likability based on their body of work in the absence of perceptual cues (e.g., using names rather than faces) would provide a useful contrast with the same rating in the presence of both facial cues and person-knowledge. Greater VMPFC activity when rating actors\u2019 body of work after seeing their faces compared with their names would provide clearer support that the VMPFC is involved in the integration of the evaluative impact from perceptual cues and person-knowledge. \n\nComplementing our ROI approach, the whole-brain analyses provided convergent information about the role played by the VMPFC in person evaluation. Consistent with our ROI analyses of the VMPFC, we observed greater activity as body-of-work ratings increased for the actors. As mentioned previously, this pattern did not manifest in the DMPFC. However, we did observe effects in bilateral amygdala that were similar to those observed in the VMPFC ROI (see Supplementary Material\u00a0 ). \n\nContrasting with the observed effects of person-knowledge in this study, we observed few effects of increasingly positive evaluations in percept-based evaluations (i.e., attractiveness judgments) in the whole-brain (see Results) or exploratory ROI analyses (see Supplementary Material\u00a0 ). Regions emerging in analyses of attractiveness ratings (actors or models) did not coincide with areas previously implicated in reward or attractiveness (e.g., ventral striatum) . It is possible that variability in another trait that is frequently conveyed through both perceptual and knowledge-based antecedents (e.g., competence ) may better delineate networks implicated in evaluations based on perceptual (vs. knowledge-based) cues. \n\nIn the current study, we used actors with whom participants were already familiar and therefore were not able to experimentally control for exact amount of information known about the actors. Nonetheless, we did attempt to control for effects of familiarity in our models in a set of supplemental analyses (see Supplementary Material\u00a0 ). Results from these supplementary analyses were consistent with those reported in the main text, suggesting that perceptual familiarity is unlikely to account for observed differences, particularly those arising in the contrast of actors versus models for attractiveness ratings. Future research should explore how the amount and kind of knowledge impacts neural networks involved in person evaluation. Furthermore, it is worth nothing that there may not have been as much variability in the negativity of the targets utilized in the current study (in either attractiveness or body-of-work judgments; see Supplementary Material\u00a0 ). As such, it would be useful in future research to provide participants with varying amounts of person-knowledge about novel individuals that equally varies in positivity and negativity. This would allow for a more systematic examination of the relative impact of valence and amount of knowledge on networks supporting person evaluation. Additionally, as our sample only included male participants, the current findings may not generalize to female participants because evaluations of attractiveness may be sensitive to perceiver gender . However, it remains unclear how perceiver gender might affect evaluations based on person-knowledge. \n\nIn conclusion, our findings indicate that activity in the VMPFC is sensitive to positive evaluations when person-knowledge is available, irrespective of whether that knowledge is relevant to one\u2019s evaluation. Previous research has found that key components of the extended brain networks supporting person perception are especially sensitive to faces associated with person-knowledge . It will be critical for future research to examine the role of the VMPFC within this broader neural network, and particularly the degree to which this region may support the dynamic integration of perceptual and knowledge-based information during person evaluation and impression formation . \n\n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSixty-one self-identified White male participants were recruited from the Chicago area via leaflets, online postings, and advertisements on public transportation for monetary compensation ($60\u2013105). See Supplementary Material\u00a0  for screening procedures. Six participants who completed the study were excluded due to an incomplete post-scan familiarity questionnaire (  n  \u2009=\u20091), in-scanner ratings not being recorded (  n  \u2009=\u20091), excessive movement in the scanner (  n  \u2009=\u20091), and familiarity with the model stimuli and/or lack of familiarity with actor stimuli (  n  \u2009=\u20093; see Procedures and Supplementary Material\u00a0 ). The remaining 55 participants were 18\u201335 years old (  M  \u2009=\u200924.255 years,   SD  \u2009=\u20094.608 years) and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Although this final sample size was approximately twice the size of an average fMRI study, it nonetheless falls short of recommended sample sizes for whole-brain across-participant analyses that adequately account for multiple comparisons  (  n  \u2009>\u200980). Following the recommendation of Vul and Pashler , we therefore focus our analyses on an a priori ROI. Previous analyses indicate that sample sizes needed for adequate power can be reduced by three to four times by adopting an ROI-based approach . Participants provided informed consent in accordance with the experimental protocol approved by the University of Chicago Institutional Review Board and in accordance with the guidelines set by the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Actor-Model task \n  \n#### Stimuli and stimulus equating \n  \nAfter piloting (see Supplementary Material\u00a0 ), we curated a sample of 90 faces for the fMRI task: 30 actors and 15 models of each gender. These stimuli were equated by independent samples of online raters (see Supplementary Material\u00a0 ). For each rating dimension, we ran a 2 (Person-knowledge: well-known actors, unknown models)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (Gender: male, female) repeated-measures ANOVA. The final stimuli were of average attractiveness and young to middle-aged. Males were significantly more dominant than females, but dominance did not vary by occupation. Actors were significantly more familiar and likeable than models, but neither rating varied by gender. Body-of-work ratings indicated that the work of both genders was similarly rated as average. Because the stimuli necessitated the use of photos of actors and models from unstandardized online sources, it was difficult to obtain and equate only photographs of neutral faces. Therefore, only stimuli with a happy or neutral expression were selected. However, facial expression did not statistically differ from an expected distribution of 2/3 neutral and 1/3 happy faces in each occupation-by-gender condition. \n\n\n#### fMRI task design \n  \nThe actor-model task consisted of an event-related design with two counterbalanced functional runs. The equated selection of 60 actors and 30 models was divided into two sets of 30 unique actors and two sets of 15 unique models, respectively. Each participant rated each of the 60 actors once on a single dimension (attractiveness or body of work) and each of the 30 models once on attractiveness. \n\nIn addition to counterbalancing the assignment of face set to runs (run 1 vs. run 2), the assignment of individual faces to evaluative rating conditions (attractiveness vs. body of work), and the assignment of response keys (ascending vs. descending), we also counterbalanced the order in which participants completed the three conditions within each run. The block orders of the two runs were completely orthogonal (i.e., no blocks were presented in the same location of the block sequence across runs). Accounting for the above factors, each participant completed one of 48 versions of the experiment. (See Supplementary Material\u00a0  more details.) \n\nBefore each block, participants saw a brief cue consisting of the rating dimension and target occupation (e.g., \u201cHow attractive are these actors?\u201d). All trials were presented on a black background and consisted of a face presented for 1500\u2009ms followed by a 500-ms white fixation. Next, a green fixation appeared prompting participants to provide their rating (i.e., attractiveness or likability based on body of work: see Fig.\u00a0 ). Responses were given on a counterbalanced four-point scale. After 1000\u2009ms, the green fixation was replaced by a final 1000-ms white fixation. Altogether, each trial lasted 4000\u2009ms, and participants had a window from 1500\u20133500\u2009ms post-stimulus onset to both form their evaluation and respond using the button box. Post-trial jittering was pseudorandomly interleaved, using 0-, 2000-, 4000-, or 6000-ms fixations (Fig.\u00a0 ). Stimulus presentation and data collection were in E-Prime 2.0 Professional ( ).   \nTrial sequence for the actor\u2013model fMRI task. Over the course of the experiment (i.e., two fMRI runs), participants evaluated 30 unique actors on attractiveness, 30 unique actors on body of work, and all 30 models on attractiveness. The silhouette presented here represents a picture of either an actor or model stimulus. Each run was split into three counterbalanced blocks, each of which began with a prompt indicating the evaluative dimension and the target type (e.g., \u201cHow attractive are these actors?\u201d). \n  \n\n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nIn the context of a larger study, participants completed online demographic and unrelated individual differences questionnaires at home (see Supplementary Material\u00a0 ). (For all experiments, we have reported all measures, conditions, data exclusions, and sample size determinations either in the main text or supplementary material.) Then participants received a list of the actors with links to their online profiles along with instructions to study the actors. Prior to coming into the lab for scanning, participants had to get 100% correct on an online quiz in which they had to identify one of two movies or write in a different movie casting that actor. This was done to ensure the participants were familiar with the actors\u2019 body of work. \n\nUpon arriving for their scanning session, participants gave informed consent and received task instructions. Outside of the scanner, participants then completed a practice block consisting of a shortened version of the main experiment (one run consisting of one 10-trial block for each of the three conditions) conducted on a computer with actors and models that would not appear in the actual study. Participants were then trained on an impression-formation task unrelated to the current investigation  (see Supplementary Material\u00a0  for full procedures). \n\nParticipants then completed the actor-model task in the scanner. After this, participants completed two runs of the unrelated impression-formation task. Finally, resting-state and anatomical scans were acquired if time allowed. Post-scan, participants completed questionnaires unrelated to the present investigation (see Supplementary Material\u00a0 ). In order to verify that our participants were indeed familiar with the actors and unfamiliar with the models (who were selected to be unfamiliar based on ratings from an independent sample), participants indicated their familiarity with all actors and models viewed in the scanner on a 9-point scale from 1 \u201cExtremely Unfamiliar\u201d to 9 \u201cExtremely Familiar\u201d. For analyses that parallel those in the results section but while accounting for these familiarity ratings, see Supplementary Material\u00a0 . \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Trial- and participant-level exclusions \n  \nFor each participant with complete fMRI and behavioral data sets (  n  \u2009=\u200958), we excluded from analyses: (1) all trials in which the participant did not provide an in-scanner rating, (2) all actors that the participant rated as somewhat to very unfamiliar (i.e., 1\u20135 on the post-scan familiarity ratings), and (3) all models that the participant rated as appearing somewhat to very familiar (i.e., 4\u20139 on the post-scan familiarity ratings) (see Supplementary Material\u00a0  for exclusions). Only 58 out of 104,400 trials were eliminated due to missing in-scanner ratings. After all trial-level exclusions, three participants were ultimately eliminated for having fewer than six trials per rating dimension (i.e., actors rated on attractiveness, models rated on attractiveness, and actors rated on body of work). The remaining 55 participants\u2019 data were analyzed. The means and standard deviations of the three in-scanner rating conditions were as follows: actors rated on attractiveness,   M  \u2009=\u20092.907,   SD  \u2009=\u20090.414; models rated on attractiveness,   M  \u2009=\u20092.762,   SD  \u2009=\u20090.339; and actors rated on body of work,   M  \u2009=\u20093.142,   SD  \u2009=\u20090.318. These mean ratings were all significantly different from each other (see Supplementary Material\u00a0  for full statistics). Within participants, we generally observed similar variability (i.e., participant-specific standard deviations in trial-level responses) for each of the three conditions,   F  (2,159)\u2009=\u20090.376,   p  \u2009=\u20090.687: actors rated on attractiveness,   M  \u2009=\u20090.825; models rated on attractiveness,   M  \u2009=\u20090.837; and actors rated on body of work,   M  \u2009=\u20090.856. \n\n\n#### fMRI data acquisition and analysis \n  \nAnatomical and functional whole-brain imaging were performed using a Philips Achieva 3.0-T scanner and 32-channel head coil at the University of Chicago MRI Research Center. Functional images in the form of 30 oblique slices were collected using Z-shim acquisition in 2 runs of 163 TRs each, using pulse sequence parameters (TR/TE\u2009=\u20092000/25\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200977\u00b0, interleaved slices with 4.0-mm thickness, 0.5-mm gap, FOV\u2009=\u2009192\u2009\u00d7\u2009134\u2009\u00d7\u2009192\u2009mm, approximately 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964-mm matrix). The order of slice acquisition varied across participants, depending on the location of the four z-shim slices . High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired in the sagittal plane using a 3D Turbo Field Echo (TFE/MP-RAGE) anatomical scan (TR\u2009=\u20098.0\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009228\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009181\u2009mm, 1.0-mm slice thickness, no gap, 240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240-mm matrix). Then thin-slice resting-state scans were collected (TR\u2009=\u20092000 ms, TE\u2009=\u200929.5\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009138\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009mm, slice thickness\u2009=\u20092.6\u2009mm with a 1.4-mm gap, an in-plane resolution of 3.75 mm , and a flip angle of 77\u00b0). \n\n  GLM   . Functional MRI data were analyzed using general linear models (GLM) in SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). Analyses were facilitated by a custom suite of scripts for fMRI analysis ( ). Data were preprocessed to remove sources of noise and artifacts. Images were realigned within and across runs to correct for head movement. Functional data were transformed into a standard anatomical space (3-mm isotropic voxels) based on the ICBM 152 brain template (Montreal Neurological Institute). Normalized data were then spatially smoothed using an 8-mm Gaussian kernel to increase signal-to-noise ratio and to reduce the impact of anatomical variability that was not corrected by stereotaxic normalization. \n\nFor each participant, a GLM was constructed to examine condition-specific brain activity as a function of the participant\u2019s in-scanner ratings (either attractiveness or likability of body of work). In-scanner ratings were coded such that larger numbers represented more positive evaluations. We used these ratings to model three regressors, each representing a linear change in neural responses within a given rating condition as condition-specific ratings increased. These regressors were incorporated as parametric predictors in each participant\u2019s level-1 GLM. Our reported analyses focused on these three parametric predictors of interest: (1) actors evaluated on body of work (i.e., familiar others rated on person-knowledge), (2) actors evaluated on attractiveness (i.e., familiar others rated on perceptual cues), and (3) models evaluated on attractiveness (i.e., unfamiliar others rated on perceptual cues). In sum, one single GLM incorporating three regressors for each of the three conditions (i.e., non-parametric parameters), three regressors for the condition-specific parametric parameters, and additional regressors for covariates of non-interest (a session mean, a linear trend to account for low-frequency drift, and six movement parameters derived from realignment corrections) were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function and used to compute parameter estimates (  \u03b2  ) for each condition at each voxel. Resulting estimates for each participant were used in ROI analyses and exploratory whole-brain parametric analyses. \n\n\n#### VMPFC ROI \n  \nROI analyses were conducted to identify the hypothesized impact of person-knowledge and perceptual cues on evaluations. Analyses focused on an 8-mm VMPFC spherical ROI that was centered on the MNI coordinates from a previous research examining various forms of person-knowledge (e.g., financial and moral status , socio-economic status , and moral appraisals ) during social evaluations (0, 52, \u22126). For each participant, mean GLM parameter estimates for the VMPFC ROI were extracted for each of the three parametric predictors of interest. ROI analyses were conducted offline in R using the stats package . We first conducted one-sample t-tests to compare each parametric predictor to zero to explore whether VMPFC activity changed as a function of ratings (i.e., increased as evaluations became more positive) for each of the three conditions. Using the R function lm, a second analysis focused on the relative impact of each parametric predictor on VMPFC activity. Following up on a significant one-way ANOVA, we tested all possible pair-wise contrasts between parametric predictors by conducting three separate linear regressions each using a unique set of contrast codes: (1) parametric predictor for actors\u2019 body of work\u2009=\u20090.5, parametric predictor for actors\u2019 attractiveness\u2009=\u20090, and parametric predictor for models\u2019 attractiveness\u2009=\u2009\u22120.5; (2) parametric predictor for actors\u2019 body of work\u2009=\u20090, parametric predictor for actors\u2019 attractiveness\u2009=\u20090.5, and parametric predictor for models\u2019 attractiveness\u2009=\u2009\u22120.5; and (3) parametric predictor for actors\u2019 body of work\u2009=\u20090.5, parametric predictor for actors\u2019 attractiveness\u2009=\u2009\u22120.5, and parametric predictor for models\u2019 attractiveness\u2009=\u20090). \n\n\n\n### Exploratory and supplementary analyses \n  \nIn addition to our main focus on the VMPFC, we conducted exploratory analyses on other regions of interest previously suggested to be involved in person evaluation and social cognition: DMPFC, bilateral nucleus accumbens, bilateral superior temporal sulcus, bilateral temporo-parietal junction, precuneus, and bilateral amygdala (see Supplementary Material\u00a0 ). \n\nAdditionally, we conducted exploratory whole-brain analyses (see Results) to identify additional brain regions potentially sensitive to modulation by in-scanner ratings in each of the three conditions: (1) person-knowledge use (i.e., actors rated on body of work only), (2) person-knowledge availability (i.e., actors rated on attractiveness only), and (3) percept-based evaluations without person-knowledge (i.e., models rated on attractiveness only). \n\nFinally, we also conducted supplementary ROI and whole-brain analyses controlling for post-scan ratings of stimulus familiarity in order to control for any remaining effects of familiarity (see Supplementary Material\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nBrain Region\tk\tt\tp\tMNI Coordinates\tMNI Coordinates\tMNI

The present study investigated the neural basis of automatic ER supported by \u2018implementation intentions\u2019. 40 healthy participants underwent fMRI while viewing emotion-eliciting images and used either a previously-taught effortful ER strategy, in the form of a goal intention (e.g., try to take a detached perspective), or a more automatic ER strategy, in the form of an implementation intention (e.g., \u201cIf I see something disgusting, then I will think these are just pixels on the screen!\u201d), to regulate their emotional response. Whereas goal intention ER strategies were associated with activation of brain areas previously reported to be involved in effortful ER (including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), ER strategies based on an implementation intention strategy were associated with activation of right inferior frontal gyrus and ventro-parietal cortex, which may reflect the attentional control processes automatically captured by the cue for action contained within the implementation intention. Goal intentions were also associated with less effective modulation of left amygdala, supporting the increased efficacy of ER under implementation intention instructions, which showed coupling of orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala. The findings support previous behavioural studies in suggesting that forming an implementation intention enables people to enact goal-directed responses with less effort and more efficiency. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEmotion regulation (ER) refers to the processes involved in the initiation, maintenance, and modification of the occurrence, intensity, and duration of feeling states [ \u2013 ]. ER is, for example, the process by which people overcome feelings of disgust in order to change a baby\u2019s nappy, or overcome sadness to successfully deliver a eulogy. Regulating emotions in this deliberative, effortful manner can be effective in modulating emotional responses, but the effect of regulation on emotional outcomes is relatively modest [ ] and may be associated with cognitive costs [ \u2013 ] and physiological resource depletion [ ]. Thus, merely deciding to regulate emotions (i.e., forming a \u2018goal intention\u2019) is not necessarily sufficient to ensure effective and sustainable regulation [ ]. \n\nOne way to increase the likelihood that ER goals influence emotional outcomes is to form an implementation intention [ \u2013 ]. An implementation intention is an \u2018if-then\u2019 plan that links a specified cue (e.g., \u201cIf I see blood\u2026\u201d) with a   specific   goal-directed response (e.g., \u201c\u2026then I will look at the situation as if I was a doctor!\u201d). Forming an implementation intention is effective because if-then plans (i) increase the accessibility of the cue specified in the if-part of the plan [ \u2013 ] and (ii) forge a strong link between the mental representation of the specified opportunity and the intended response [ \u2013 ]. Consequently, there is evidence that merely encountering the cue triggers the intended response in an immediate and efficient manner [ \u2013 ] without the need for conscious deliberation   in situ  . In short, an implementation intention recruits automatic processes in the service of a controlled strategy\u2014a process known as 'strategic automaticity\u2019 [ ]. \n\nSchweiger Gallo and colleagues [ ] (Study 1), showed that ER instructions in the form of an implementation intention (e.g., \u201cIf I see blood, then I will remain calm and relaxed!\u201d) were more effective at modulating emotional outcomes than were ER instructions framed as a goal intention (\u201ce.g., \u201cI will not get disgusted!\u201d). An EEG study [ ] (Study 3) showed that the implementation intention influenced emotional responses early in the perceptual process (~100ms), which is consistent with the idea that implementation intentions reflect a relatively automatic process drawing on associations between a specified cue (e.g., \u201cIf I see blood\u2026\u201d) and a specific goal-directed response. There have now been approximately 30 studies investigating the effects of forming implementation intentions on emotional outcomes. A recent meta-analysis [ ] indicated that forming implementation intentions is effective at modifying emotional outcomes, with a large effect relative to no-regulation instructions (  d   = 0.91) and a medium-sized effect relative to goal intention instructions (  d   = 0.53). \n\nDespite evidence of the impact of forming implementation intentions on emotional outcomes, no studies to date have used fMRI to investigate the neural underpinnings of ER by implementation intentions. Understanding the neural basis of ER by implementation intentions is important both to understand the similarities and differences between ER by implementation intentions versus goal intentions, and to clarify whether if-then plans engender strategic automatization of ER. Previous research has reported that effortful ER strategies are associated with activation in prefrontal and temporal areas related to cognitive control including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), pre-supplementary motor area (pSMA), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and lateral temporal cortex [ \u2013 ]. Such effortful strategies decrease activity in subcortical limbic areas such as the amygdala (for meta-analyses, see [ \u2013 ]). Based on evidence that implementation intentions endow ER with features of automaticity (i.e., immediacy, efficiency, and redundancy of conscious intent; see [ ] for a review), and theoretical proposals that automatic regulation of emotion might be supported by medial frontal areas such as orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) [ \u2013 ], ER by implementation intentions should show a different pattern of prefrontal recruitment. In particular, increased modulation of the amygdala and limbic system by ventromedial prefrontal cortex regions (such as the medial orbitofrontal cortex [mOFC]) should be observed. \n\nThe mOFC is well-suited to playing a role in automatic emotion regulation via implementation intentions, being a heteromodal association area that unites information from the sensory modalities, interoceptive information from the body, and representations of prior experiences [ ] [ ]. It is involved in associative processes such as classical conditioning and reversal learning [ ], and processing contextually-relevant information [ ]. The mOFC is also part of the brain\u2019s \u201cassociation system\u201d [ \u2013 ] that is thought to use representations of prior experiences to make meaning of current sensations from the body and world [ ] [ ]. As such, it may contribute to the automatic regulation of emotion by helping a person to interpret visual sensations (an image) in light of learned associations (e.g., when I see the picture on screen, I will not react!), thereby reducing the intensity of emotional responding. \n\nIn the only previous study investigating the neural basis of implementation intentions using fMRI (but not involving emotion regulation), Gilbert and colleagues [ ] compared prospective memory instructions that cued the intended response (e.g., \u201cIF the same letter is on both sides, THEN I will press the middle button!\u201d) with self-initiated instructions (goal intentions) that did not link the cue with a particular response (e.g., \u201cIF the same letter is on both sides, THEN I can score 5 points!\u201d). Although both sets of instructions were expressed in a contingent \u2018if-then\u2019 structure, Gilbert and colleagues proposed that only the cued instructions forged a direct link between the specified cue and the intended response in the manner associated with implementation intentions. As hypothesised by Gilbert and colleagues, performance on the prospective memory task was better under cued than under self-initiated instructions. Furthermore, performance under cued instructions was associated with increased activation within areas of the rostral prefrontal cortex including mPFC (BA10). Performance under self-initiated instructions, by comparison, was associated with greater activation of lateral BA10. Given that previous studies have associated medial BA 10 with environmentally-driven behaviour, and lateral BA 10 with tasks requiring attention to be diverted toward self-generated information [ \u2013 ] Gilbert and colleagues\u2019 findings support the differing demands of cued performance versus self-initiated performance. Moreover, they suggest that the neural basis of ER under implementation intention versus goal intention may be distinct from one another. \n\n### The Present Research \n  \nWe used fMRI to investigate the neural basis of ER under implementation intentions versus goal intention instructions. Participants regulated their emotional responses to a series of disgust- or sadness-eliciting images. Prior to the fMRI scan, one-half of the participants were given a goal intention strategy to use, while the other half were given an ER strategy based on implementation intentions. We hypothesized that ER under implementation intentions would be more effective than under goal intentions as indexed by self reported affect. Neurally, we hypothesized that ER under goal intention instructions would recruit areas of the lateral prefrontal cortex, particularly DLPFC. In contrast, we hypothesized that ER under implementation intentions instructions would show a different pattern of prefrontal recruitment, relying more on medial frontal areas such as orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We also hypothesized that the amygdala would show differential activation according to task instructions, given its role in the representation of emotional experiences and perceptions in general (for meta-analyses see [ ] [ ], but especially its decreased activity during successful emotion regulation (for meta-analyses see; [ \u2013 ]). Specifically we hypothesized that ER under implementation intentions would be associated with lower activity within the amygdala than ER under goal intentions. Finally, we hypothesized that connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex would vary as a function of implementation intentions versus goal intention instructions. Specifically, we hypothesized that the amygdala would show enhanced connectivity with regions such as DLPFC during ER under goal intentions, whereas ER supported by implementation intentions would show enhanced connectivity of the amygdala with more medial prefrontal regions, such as the OFC. \n\nGiven that emotionally laden images have previously been demonstrated to also impact peripheral physiological responses [ \u2013 ] and that voluntary ER to such stimuli has been shown to affect peripheral physiological responses such as the skin conductance response [ ], we also collected skin conductance responses in order to investigate whether the nature of the instruction influenced autonomic responses. It was hypothesized that if ER under implementation intentions was associated with lower affect ratings, that this would also be reflected in concurrent reduced skin conductance responses. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nForty right-handed healthy participants (20 males; mean age = 20; range 18\u201323 yrs) were recruited from the local student population. Exclusion criteria were any current psychiatric or neurological disorder or contraindication to MR imaging. All participants spoke English as a first language and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. \n\n\n### Ethics Statement \n  \nWritten informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study was approved by the University of Sheffield Research Ethics Committee. \n\n\n### Pre-scan training \n  \nIn the 48-hours prior to the scan, participants completed the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ ] the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) [ ] and the revised version of the Disgust Sensitivity questionnaire [ ] ( ). These measures were included in order to ensure that participants in the goal intention and implementation intention groups were matched for handedness, trait emotional sensitivity and habitual emotion regulation style. Participants were randomised to either the goal intention or implementation intention group. A practice phase involved viewing three example stimuli to confirm that they understood the task. \n   Baseline characteristics of participants (mean \u00b1 SD).        \n\n### Goal intention and implementation intention instructions \n  \nBoth goal intention and implementation intention groups received two sets of instructions; each to be used in one functional run of the experiment. The first set of instructions told participants in the goal intention group that \u201cWhen viewing pictures preceded by REAPPRAISE you should adopt a detached and unemotional attitude\u201d. These instructions were based on reappraisal or distancing strategies widely used in previous studies of effortful ER [ \u2013 ]. Participants in the implementation intentions group received the further instruction: \"If I see REAPPRAISE, then I will tell myself that \u2018these are just pixels on a screen and the picture can't get to me!\u201d. The second instruction told participants in the goal intention group that \u201cSome pictures will be preceded by the word SUPPRESS. When viewing these pictures you should try to stop yourself from getting emotional. In other words, try to suppress any feelings you have when looking at the picture\u201d (similar to the strategy used in [ ]). Participants in the implementation intentions group received the further instruction: \u201cIf I see SUPPRESS, then \u2018I will block out all bad feelings and just stay cool!'\". Although the two sets of instructions for each condition were labelled as \u2018reappraise\u2019 or \u2018suppress\u2019, it should be noted that both might be interpreted as strategies traditionally defined as \u2018distancing\u2019 oneself from the stimulus in order to achieve emotional control. In this respect the \u2018suppress\u2019 instruction does not strictly correspond with the strategy of expressive suppression which involves avoiding any behavioural display of emotion [ ]; suppression here is rather a form of cognitive suppression and relates to the experience rather than the expression of emotion [ ]. Hence, the key difference between the ER instructions received by the two groups was that the implementation intentions instruction specified a cue (which could be quickly and accurately identified), the intended response (hence reducing the need for deliberation about how to respond) and tied the cue and response together in an \u2018if-then\u2019 format (thus promoting automatic response initiation). \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nImages were chosen from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) [ ] on the basis of the normative arousal and valence ratings provided by [ ], with the specificity of disgust or sadness selected on the basis of category-specific ratings from [ ]. Disgust and sadness-eliciting images were included in order to not limit the instructions to a single emotion type. Nine neutral stimuli were also selected. Neutral stimuli were included primarily as a means of providing a buffer against the compound effects of repeated presentations of emotional stimuli. Details of the specific stimuli used are in  . The experiment was programmed in Presentation v14.4 (Neurobehavioural Systems, Inc) and stimuli were projected onto a screen that was viewable through a forward-mounted mirror above the MR scanner head coil. \n\n\n### Paradigm details \n  \nEach 19.5 second trial began with the presentation of the instruction to \u2018attend, \u2018reappraise\u2019 or \u2018suppress\u2019 onscreen for 3 seconds. Participants were told that images preceded by the word \u2018attend\u2019 should be viewed naturally, allowing any feelings elicited by the image to occur (based on instructions used by [ \u2013 ]). For images preceded by the word \u2018reappraise\u2019 or \u2018suppress\u2019, participants were instructed to carry out the ER instructions that they had been taught. An image was then presented for 10 seconds, during the first 6-seconds of which the image appeared to advance towards the participant increasing from 80% of screen size to filling the screen. This manipulation was designed to increase the impact of the image and therefore the regulatory requirements [ ]. Following each image, the question \u201cHow sad/disgusted did you feel while looking at the image?\u201d appeared on screen for 5 seconds. Participants used the first two fingers of the right hand to press two buttons on a button box to move the cursor on the screen to the desired location on a Likert scale anchored by \u2018not at all\u2019 and \u2018very much\u2019. Finally, a fixation cross appeared for 1.5 seconds ( ). \n   Events comprising each trial.    \nParticipants viewed a total of 45 stimuli in each run; 18 stimuli were designed to elicit disgust (9 viewed under instructions to regulate and 9 to attend), 18 stimuli were designed to elicit sadness (9 viewed under the instruction to regulate, and 9 to attend), and there were 9 neutral stimuli (attend only). Within each run, \u2018pseudo-blocks\u2019 of regulation type were created whereby participants followed the instruction to regulate or attend on between 2\u20134 successive trials, in order to increase the ease of using each strategy (i.e., reduce the demands of task switching). The order of stimuli was also pseudo-randomized such that no instruction type (reappraise, suppress or attend) appeared more than four times in succession, and no stimulus category (sad, disgust or neutral) appeared more than three times in succession. \n\nEach image was only viewed once during each run. Different images were used for the two runs, such that participants viewed 90 images in total over the two runs; images in the two runs were matched for arousal and valence. The images used in each block, and whether an image was viewed under the instruction to regulate or attend, were counterbalanced across participants. The order of runs (reappraise and suppress) was also counter balanced within both groups (implementation intention and goal intention). \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nDuring each functional run (lasting 14 minutes and 39 seconds), 293 volumes were obtained at 3T (Achieva, Philips Medical Systems, Best, NL) comprising 32 x 4mm thick contiguous slices (in-plane resolution 1.797x1.797mm) covering the entire cerebrum and cerebellum. A single-shot, gradient-recalled echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence was used: TR = 3 seconds; TE = 35 msecs; FOV = 240mm; in-plane matrix = 128x128mm). A high resolution T1-weighted structural scan was also collected for spatial normalisation (3D gradient echo, MP-RAGE, TR = 10.5ms; TE = 4.8ms; spatial resolution = 0.8mm ). \n\n\n### fMRI data preprocessing \n  \nfMRI data were analyzed in SPM 8 ( ) implemented in MATLAB 7.1 (Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA). Images were motion-corrected, co-registered to each individual\u2019s high-resolution T1-weighted scan, spatially normalised to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) [ ] single subject template using the unified segmentation approach [ ], and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (full-width half-maximum of 8mm). Of the 80 runs collected (40 subjects x 2 runs), 5 were excluded due to excessive head motion (>2mm). Blood-oxygen-level-dependant (BOLD) response was modelled to an event-related wave-form, convolved with a canonical haemodynamic response function and its temporal derivative. Individuals\u2019 movement parameters were included as regressors in the contrast model to control for movement-related artefacts. Our contrast of interest focused on the 13-second period from when participants were first given the instruction to \u2018regulate\u2019 or \u2018attend\u2019 up to when the image was removed ( ). This 13-second window captured the entire regulation period, based on evidence that implementation intentions have rapid effects following identification of the relevant cue [ ] and that these effects may last as long as the emotion-eliciting stimulus is present. At the level of the individual subject, epochs of \u2018regulate\u2019 were contrasted with epochs of \u2018attend\u2019. These first-level, fixed effects analyses were then taken forward to a second, group-level, flexible factorial design. Resulting contrasts from this flexible factorial design were examined at a both more conservative (p<0.05, FWE corrected) and more liberal (p<0.001 uncorrected) statistical thresholds. Finding objective and effective thresholds for voxelwise statistics derived from neuroimaging data has been a long-standing and ongoing issue of debate [ ], though it has been suggested that optimal thresholds are lower than corrected for multiple comparison thresholds [ ]. Specifically, we sought to fully investigate the accuracy of our   a priori   hypotheses while mitigating against over-reporting of Type 1 (false positive) results. While it has been reported [ ] that brain-wide correction for multiple comparisons is unduly conservative for novel complex cognitive and affective social neuroscience processes such as were examined in the present study, we do not believe that use of such correction methods is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 issue (i.e. that intermediate height and extent voxel-thresholds may be valuable in exploratory data analyses and suggesting future hypotheses). Hence, we have reported and interpreted activations at an uncorrected statistical threshold only if they were   a priori   hypothesised. We have additionally reported contrast values for relevant contrasts and utilised ROI analyses where appropriate. Co-ordinates for foci of activation were converted from MNI to Talairach by using the \u2018mni2tal\u2019 function within MATLAB. \n\n#### Region of interest analysis \n  \nTo examine the relationship between the activity within the amygdala and the efficacy of ER, a region of interest analysis was performed using the MarsBaR toolbox within SPM [ ]. A mask of the left amygdala was created using the WFU PickAtlas toolbox [ ], from which mean signal change during ER trials was extracted for each participant. This mean signal change was then correlated with participants\u2019 self-reported reduction in affect during ER trials. \n\n\n#### Connectivity analyses \n  \nFor connectivity analyses, the time course of activation of amygdala from each individual was extracted when viewing all emotional images, (disgust and sad eliciting, but not neutral) regardless of regulation instruction. The search was constrained by a mask of the left amygdala (WFU Pickatlas toolbox within SPM8; [ ]). The maximally activated voxel from this analysis was used as the centre of a 5mm radius sphere from which the first eigenvariate was extracted. \n\nA psychophysiological interaction (PPI) term was produced by multiplying these amygdala time course vectors with the paradigm vector (regulate +1, attend-1, neutral 0). This PPI term was then re-entered as a regressor at the first level for each individual as an effect of interest, along with the time course and paradigm vectors as effects of no interest. This PPI term allowed examination of how the amygdala connectivity varied as a result of the instruction to regulate via goal intention or implementation intention strategies or attend. These first-level images were taken forward to a second-level, flexible factorial model with factors of subject and condition. From this second level contrast we investigated areas showing enhanced connectivity with the amygdala under the instruction of \u2018regulation\u2019 in comparison with \u2018attend\u2019. We also examined connectivity differences between goal intention and implementation intention ER-strategy processes. Results for the connectivity analyses are presented at p<.001 (uncorrected), with an extent threshold of 5 voxels. \n\n\n\n### Skin Conductance Response (SCR) \n  \nMR-compatible SCR equipment was based on a battery-powered, electrically-isolated, same electrode configuration implementation of a previously published method [ ]. SCRs were sampled at 20 Hz from the medial phalange of the left index and middle fingers, using 8mm diameter Ag / AgCl electrodes. SCR traces were analysed in Ledalab v.3.2.9 [ ] using the Continuous Decomposition Analysis method to distinguish the phasic (driver) information from the underlying tonic sudomotor nerve activity. Raw SCR data were smoothed via convolution with a Hann window to reduce error noise and fitted to a bi-exponential Bateman function. Data were optimised by a conjugated gradient descent algorithm to reduce the error between them and the inbuilt SCR model. These processing steps allowed computation of a stimulus-locked \u2018integrated skin conductance response\u2019 (ISCR), a time-integration of the continuous phasic activity for each stimulus. This ISCR therefore represents an unbiased and time-sensitive measure of sympathetic activity in response to each stimulus [ ]. For investigating whether implementation intention and goal intention ER strategies may be associated with different skin conductance response, ISCRs from participants in both groups were averaged across epochs, within-subject, using SPSS v19 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Technical problems meant we were unable to obtain SCR recording from all participants; recording was obtained from a total of 26 participants (13 in each group). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Self-reported affect \n  \nA 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA (within-subject factor of regulation condition [regulate or attend]; between-subject factor of instruction type [goal intention or implementation intention]) showed a main effect of regulation condition (\u2018regulate\u2019 lower than \u2018attend\u2019; F(1,36) = 118.1, p<.0001). Implementation intention instructions were associated with larger changes in affect (attend-regulate) than goal intention instructions (mean change = 1.85 and 1.31 respectively;   t  (34) = 1.85,   p   < .05;  ), indicating that implementation intentions were more effective in reducing the intensity of emotional experience than were goal intentions. Both of the strategies were associated with lower affect ratings for the regulate condition compared to the attend condition (implementation intentions;   t  (19) = 7.28, p<.01; goal intentions;   t  (19) = 8.33, p<.01). \n   Mean change in affect ratings (and standard error) as a function of emotion regulation for the two groups.  \nA greater mean change in affect rating is indicative of more successful emotion regulation (i.e. a larger reduction in affect ratings for the emotion regulation compared to not regulating emotion). \n  \nThere was no difference between the reappraise and suppress strategy in reducing self-reported affect (  t  (37) = 1.36, p = .18). There was a significantly greater reduction in affect for the disgust images compared to the sad images (  t  (37) = 5.12, p<.05). \n\n\n### Neuroimaging data \n  \n#### Conventional analyses.   ER under implementation intention instructions (ERii > attend)  \n  \nER under implementation intention instructions contrasted with the attend condition was associated with activations including right middle frontal gyrus (BA10; signal change = 0.43), right inferior frontal gyrus (BA47; signal change = 0.19), right superior temporal gyrus/temporo-parietal junction (BA39; signal change = 0.12), right inferior parietal lobule (BA40; signal change = 0.23), left precentral gyrus (BA6; signal change = 0.15) and left posterior cingulate gyrus (signal change = 0.12)(  and  ; p<0.001 uncorrected; extent threshold = 20 voxels). \n   Areas activated in the contrast implementation intention > attend.           Brain areas more involved in emotion regulation by implementation intentions in comparison to attending to images.  \nData presented at p<.001 uncorrected, extent threshold 20 voxels. \n  \n\n#### ER under goal intention instructions (ERgi > attend) \n  \nER under goal intention instructions compared with the attend condition was associated with activation of areas including bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG; BA8/9; right MFG; signal change = 0.21, left MFG signal change = 0.30) and left superior temporal gyrus/temporo-parietal junction (BA39; signal change = 0.05) ( , p<0.001 uncorrected; extent threshold = 20 voxels). \n   Areas activated in the contrast goal intention > attend.        \n\n#### Direct comparison of ER under implementation intention with ER under goal intention \n  \nER under implementation intention instructions (ERii > attend) compared with ER under goal intention instructions (ERgi > attend) was associated with activations including left precentral gyrus (BA6; signal change = 0.08), precuneus (signal change = 0.12), right superior temporal gyrus (BA39/22; signal change = 0.02), and right inferior parietal lobule (BA40; signal change = 0.13) ( ). \n   Direct comparison of implementation intentions and goal intentions.        \nER under goal intention instructions compared with ER under implementation intention instructions was associated with greater activation of left sub-genual ACC (BA 25; signal change = 0.09), left superior frontal gyrus (BA8; signal change = 0.11), and the left amygdala (signal change = 0.11) ( ). \n   Brain areas showing greater activation under emotion regulation by goal intentions than implementation intentions (both strategies compared with attending to images).  \nData presented at p<.001 uncorrected, extent threshold 20 voxels. \n  \nIn order to further investigate the role of the left amygdala response we also conducted a region of interest analysis for the contrasts of attend > implementation intentions, and attend > goal intentions. This analysis revealed a greater left amygdala response to attending to the emotional images in comparison to emotion regulation for the implementation intentions group (t = 2.82, p<.01 corrected) but not for the goal intentions group (t = -0.52, p>.05 corrected), supporting the notion that ER by implementation intention was associated with greater down-regulation of left amygdala in comparison to ER under goal intention. \n\n\n#### Correlation with behavioural data \n  \nLower self-reported affect during ER corresponded with relatively reduced left amygdala activity (ER > attend) (R =. -344; p = 0.04;  ). That is, more successful ER was associated with a greater reduction in left amygdala activity. When looking the two groups (implementation intentions and goal intention) it was found that this correlation was significant for the implementation intention group (R = -.512, p<.05) but not for the goal intentions group (R = -.316, p = .19), although a Fisher\u2019s Z-transformation showed that the correlation coefficients for the two groups did not differ significantly (z = -0.56, two-tailed p = 0.58). There was no significant correlation found with the right amygdala for both groups together, or the implementation intentions and goal intentions group individually. \n   Correlation between the left amygdala signal during emotion regulation and the reduction in self report affect rating as a result of emotion regulation.  \nThe greater the reduction in affect rating rating is indicative of more successful emotion regulation (i.e. a larger reduction in affect ratings for the emotion regulation compared to not regulating emotion). \n  \n\n\n### Functional connectivity analyses \n  \nDuring ER under implementation intention instructions (ERii > attend), the left amygdala showed connectivity with right parahippocampal gyrus (BA38) and orbitofrontal cortex (BA11) ( ). During ER under goal intention instructions (ERgi > attend), the bilateral middle/superior frontal gyrus (BA8), right ACC (BA24), and left putamen showed functional connectivity with the left amygdala ( ). \n   Areas demonstrating enhanced connectivity with the left amygdala under the condition of emotion regulation by implementation intention than under attend.           Areas demonstrating enhanced connectivity with the left amygdala under the condition of emotion regulation by goal intention than under attend.        \n\n### Skin conductance response \n  \nA 2 x 3 repeated measures ANOVA revealed a main effect of regulation (regulate, attend, or neutral)(F(2,23) = 3.5, p<.05) but no interaction with instruction type (goal intention or implementation intention) (F(2,23) = 1.51, p = .24). A paired samples t-test showed that ISCR was significantly higher when attending to emotional images (mean ISCR = 1.318) compared to when attending to neutral images (mean = 1.06; t(25) = 2.33, p<.05). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe used fMRI to investigate the neural basis of two emotion regulation (ER) strategies that varied in their inherent automaticity. One half of the participants were instructed to use a general \u2018goal intention\u2019 strategy to regulate their emotions, while the other half of the participants used a more specific \u2018implementation intention\u2019 strategy. Behavioural and fMRI activation results supported our overarching hypothesis that implementation intentions are an effective means of achieving emotion regulation, which may in part be due to modulation of the amygdala by a relatively automatic process mediated by the orbitofrontal cortex. \n\nLower self-report affect among participants who formed an implementation intention compared to those who formed a goal intention supports previous studies suggesting that forming an implementation intention is an effective way to regulate affect [ ][ ]. The increased efficacy of the implementation intention was also supported by the neuroimaging data, which showed that activity in the amygdala was higher during ER under goal intention instructions than under implementation intention instructions (and that amygdala activity was higher in the contrast attend > implementation intention, but not for attend > goal intention). The general role of the amygdala in ER was further supported by a significant correlation between the reduction in amygdala signal during emotion regulation and the reduction in affect for the implementation intention group as well as the goal intention group [ ] [ ] [ ] though we note that this analysis reveals that some participants showed an increase in amygdala activation whereas other participants showed a decrease. One possible explanation for this variability could be the fact that previous studies have shown that the amygdala tends to show an increase in response to the presentation of affective pictures [ \u2013 ] and that the signal may only begin to reduce after a delayed period during which the image is not presented. The current study maintained the image on screen throughout the entire regulation period, which may imply that the reduction in amygdala signal was not as great as for when the image is removed from view. It is also interesting within this study that only the left amygdala showed the differential reduction in activation as a function of emotion regulation instruction. Some other studies [ ] [ ] and one meta-analysis [ ] have found similar modulation specifically within left amygdala during regulation of negative material. It is possible that this laterality effect may relate to the notion that the response of left amygdala to emotional stimuli is perhaps greater [ ] or more sustained than that of the right [ \u2013 ]. It is also possible that the left amygdala may be more preferentially involved when the nature of the required processing for the emotional stimulus is more linguistic in nature [ ]. However given that many other studies of goal intentions ER, including another recent meta-analysis [ ], have also found an effect within the right as well as left amygdala, it is difficult to precisely account for this laterality effect. Future studies investigating emotion regulation by implementation intentions may be able to more systematically examine any role of the right amygdala by manipulating factors such as the length of presentation of the stimulus, or the linguistic complexity of the implementation intention instruction. \n\nIn line with previous studies of more effortful ER (e.g. [ ] [ ] [ ]; for a meta-analysis, see [ ]) we observed that goal intention instructions activated bilateral DLPFC and left temporoparietal junction (TPJ). These data are consistent with models of voluntary ER which suggest that it involves \u2018executive control\u2019 systems related to effortful processes. Indeed, recent findings support the idea that regions such as left DLPFC are involved in effortful executive processing generally, rather than being specific to ER [ \u2013 ]. In contrast, ER under implementation intention instructions showed a different pattern of prefrontal recruitment and was associated with activation in a network of right lateralised fronto-parietal regions. ER guided by an implementation intention is therefore dissociable from ER guided by goal intention to the extent that different neural systems are recruited. \n\nOur hypothesis that amygdala-frontal connectivity would be evident during ER under goal intention instructions was confirmed and is consistent with a number of previous investigations of ER under goal intention instructions [ ] [ ]. Our data therefore provide further support for a model in which the efficacy of voluntary ER is driven by top-down modulation of the amygdala by frontal regions, particularly those involved in cognitive control. No such effect was found for ER under implementation intention instructions. Instead, we found connectivity during ER under implementation intention instructions between amygdala and perirhinal cortex/parahippocampal gyrus, and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Connectivity between the left amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex during ER under implementation intention instructions is noteworthy given the orbitofrontal cortex\u2019s suggested role in automatic ER [ \u2013 ] [ ]. Our data, therefore, suggest that some of the effects of ER supported by an implementation intention may be achieved through down-regulation of amygdala activity by the OFC. Other research has also suggested that connectivity between OFC and amygdala is associated with individual differences in ER [ ] and that changes in this OFC-amygdala coupling may be a marker for risk of psychiatric diseases such as bipolar disorder [ ], anxiety and depression [ ]. \n\nIt is noteworthy that activation of sub-genual anterior cingulate (sgACC; BA25) was found for the contrast of goal intention > implementation intention, given that this region has previously been associated with voluntary emotion regulation [ ]. Activation in this region may therefore reflect the increased cognitive effort required for regulation under a goal intention, given that the appropriate action is not pre-planned in the same way as regulation under an implementation intention. This would support the proposed role of sgACC as a general mediator of ER in the absence of specific instructions towards a particular strategy [ ]. \n\nActivation of the rIFG during ER under implementation intentions could reflect the involvement of the rIFG in the relevant inhibitory processes involved in emotion regulation such as inhibition of motor [ ] and prepotent responses [ ], emotional distraction [ ], and the sustaining of attention [ ]. However the concurrent increased activity within right ventro-parietal cortex (rvPC) results in a network that is strikingly similar to that observed during paradigms investigating attentional control [ ]. Hampshire and colleagues report that the rIFG and right vPC are part of a network engaged by cues that trigger task-relevant behaviour. An interpretation of this finding, consistent with Hampshire and colleagues\u2019 data, might therefore be that activation within such areas reflects a rapid orienting of attention that is captured by the relevant cue word appearing onscreen. This pattern of rIFG and rvPC activation was not seen during ER under a goal intention, supporting the idea that forming an implementation intention may heighten the accessibility of the cue word [ \u2013 ]. \n\nTaken together, our findings suggest that the automatic nature of ER under implementation intention instructions seems to be driven by the increased salience of the cue word (supported by rIFG), which allows efficient retrieval of the goal-directed response (supported by rvPC) that, in turn, facilitates more automatic regulation of the emotional response (in the amygdala) by systems known to be involved in more automatic ER (e.g., the OFC). \n\nActivation within the left precentral gyrus during ER under implementation intention instructions was not one of our specific hypotheses. However it is possible that this activation reflects the involvement of the left precentral gyrus in the activation of verbal working memory [ \u2013 ]. Given that the right vPC (also activated during ER under implementation intention instructions) has also been implicated in retrieving previously learnt information for use in working memory [ ], the neural substrates of ER under implementation intention instructions might therefore be interpreted in these terms to the extent that participants learn a particular piece of information (the if-then plan) which is then brought \u2018online\u2019 once the participant encounters the cue for action. Previous behavioural work has attempted to distinguish implementation intention from prospective memory instructions, and has suggested that implementation intention (but not prospective memory) instructions lead to automatic response initiation [ \u2013 ]. \n\nAlthough skin conductance response was higher for the emotional stimuli than neutral stimuli, further supporting the self-report data that the emotional stimuli did indeed induce emotional responses in participants, our data suggest that the nature of the ER strategy (goal- or implementation intention) did not modulate the autonomic response. It is possible that the relatively small difference in self-reported affect between the groups would not be reflected in significant SCR differences. Indeed, while we have previously shown a significant difference in ISCR between different categories of stimuli (threat vs. harm, [ ]), we have not yet found differences between ER strategies applied to the same category of stimuli. It is also possible that the skin conductance response may have been influenced, particularly in the implementation intention group, by the salient cue. Indeed, the neural data indicates that the cue for action promoted attentional capture, which may also be reflected in the skin conductance response, which is known to exhibit an \u2018orienting response\u2019 to salient stimuli [ \u2013 ]. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nOne limitation of the current study is that it used only young adult participants. Further studies using older populations are warranted given increasing evidence that the mechanisms of emotion regulation change in older populations [ ] and that the nature of self-regulation more generally may be different in older populations [ ]. Such studies could therefore examine whether the benefits of forming an implementation intention for regulating emotion are maintained throughout the lifespan. \n\nWe also acknowledge that we have utilised a relatively liberal height and extent threshold for our fMRI results, which may have led to reporting of some Type I (false positive) errors. The use of a mapwide false discovery rate (FDR) and family-wise error (FWE) of p<0.05 can be unduly conservative for novel complex cognitive and affective social neuroscience processes as were examined in this study [ ]. We have therefore reported corrected results where possible and incorporated percent signal change values into our results. In light of reporting results from various analyses, we have exerted considerable caution to avoid over-interpretation of results, but hope that we have found a balance, such that the more tentative findings from this initial fMRI study of implementation intentions are reported so that they might feed into future hypotheses. Specifically, to address issues of power, a future study might consider using our specific imaging parameters (e.g. image matrix size, mask, voxel dimensions, and smoothing kernel) to conduct a (  post-hoc  ) power analysis [ ]. Finally, in the present study we have modelled the complex, and possibly temporally-variant process of ER as a single 13-second epoch, but acknowledge that in some regions of the brain, more transient responses may also be present. A future study might therefore consider whether an analysis modelling shorter duration events would reveal additional activations of interest. It is also worth noting that although the use of 19.5s trial length and TR = 3s constituted an \u2018offset TR\u2019 method of jittering, additional jittering of the length of the inter-trial interval (ITI) may have also led to a better characterisation of the shape of the hemodynamic response function [ \u2013 ]. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nThe present research demonstrates that ER supported by an implementation intention is associated with dissociable neural activations compared with ER under goal intention instructions. The effect of forming an implementation intention seems to be driven by processes involved in attentional control and may support more efficient regulation of areas such as the amygdala, by areas involved in automatic ER, such as OFC. \n\n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone.0119500.t001\n### Label: Table 1\nMean (S.D)\tGoal Intentions (N = 20)\tImplementation Intentions (N = 20)\tUnnamed: 3\nAge in years\t20 \u00b11\t20 \u00b11\tt = -.28, p = .95\nHandedness\t71 \u00b112\t71 \u00b113\tt = .19, p = .85\nDisgust sensitivity???\t36 \u00b116\t36 \u00b115\tt = .01, p = .99\nERQ reappraisal???\t30 \u00b16\t29 \u00b17\tt = .41, p = .69\nERQ suppression???\t19 \u00b15\t20 \u00b1 3\tt = .78, p = .45\n### Caption\nBaseline characteristics of participants (mean \u00b1 SD).\n### Footer\nParticipants in the goal intention and implementation intention groups were matched for age, handedness, baseline emotional sensitivity and habitual ER use1Disgust Sensitivity questionnaire [46].2Emotion Regulation questionnaire [45].\n\n\n## ID: pone.0119500.t002\n### Label: Table 2\nArea\tTal coordinates\tTal coordinates\tTal coordinates\tVoxels\tz value\tPeak-level p (uncorr)\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tX\tY\tZ\tUnnamed: 4_level_1\tUnnamed: 5_level_1\tUnnamed: 6_level_1\nRt.

The present eye-tracking/fMRI study now extends these findings to adolescents with autism. Our results show that in adolescents with autism JA is subserved by abnormal activation patterns in brain areas related to social cognition abnormalities which are at the core of ASD including the STS and TPJ, despite behavioral maturation with no behavioral differences. Furthermore, in the autism group we observed increased neural activity in a network of social and emotional processing areas during interactions with their mother. Moreover, data indicated that less severely affected individuals with autism showed higher frontal activation associated with self-initiated interactions. Taken together, this study provides first-time data of JA in children/adolescents with autism incorporating the interactive character of JA, its reciprocity and motivational aspects. The observed functional differences in adolescents ASD suggest that persistent developmental differences in the neural processes underlying JA contribute to social interaction difficulties in ASD. \n   Highlights  \n  \nGaze-contingent fMRI task to study joint attention in a developmental sample with autism \n  \nJA in the autism group elicited abnormal activation in social cognition related areas. \n  \nThe interaction partner's familiarity modulated brain activity in the autism group. \n  \nIn the autism group frontal activation is related to the severity of communication deficits. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSocial interactions form a substantial part of human daily living and typically develop from fundamental processes during infancy to highly sophisticated processes in adolescence and adulthood. Impaired social interactions constitute a core deficit of autism spectrum disorder (ASD;  ) and deficits in the development of joint attention (JA) are one of the earliest signs to be at risk for ASD ( ). JA, i.e., the shared attentional focus of two people on an object or third person, typically develops within the first two years of life. Other-initiated JA refers to the ability to follow the direction of gaze and gestures of others, whereas self-initiated JA refers to the ability to use gaze and gestures to direct the attention of others (e.g.,  ,  ). Several lines of research suggest that other-initiated and self-initiated JA reflect distinct but interacting processes. Other-initiated and self-initiated JA follow dissociated developmental pathways during typical early childhood ( ) as well as during atypical development ( ) and may rely on potentially distinct neural networks ( ). In general, JA is considered as a prerequisite for sophisticated social processes, such as false-belief reasoning. In fact, JA is assumed to be an important developmental precursor to overall social and cognitive abilities facilitating human learning and development ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Accordingly, early interventions focusing on JA also improve other social communicative skills ( ,  ,  ). \n\nDespite extensive behavioral research on JA ( ,  ,  ,  ), data on the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain scarce, to date ( ,  ). Previous fMRI studies relied on subjects' mere observation of gaze cues to investigate JA ( ,  ). However, interactive paradigms, simulating social interaction by means of gaze-contingent responses of the interaction partner, are better suited to capture the interactive character and reciprocity of JA. They may thus be more appropriate to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying deficits in ASD ( ,  ). To this end, we recently adapted a combined eye-tracking/fMRI paradigm investigating (self- and other-initiated) JA in healthy adults ( ,  ) for the use in children and adolescents and could, thus, investigate the developmental trajectories of brain networks supporting JA in typically developing (TD) children and adolescents ( ). \n\nTo date, only one study has used an interactive task to investigate the neural correlates of JA in ASD ( ). Importantly, this study focused on adults. Authors reported aberrant activation in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) during JA in adults with ASD compared to healthy controls, despite successful established JA, i.e., no behavioral differences between groups. Consistently, the STS has been identified as part of the JA network in TD children/adolescents ( ) and healthy adults ( ,  ), supporting its crucial role in various aspects of social functioning ( ,  ). In contrast, in adults with ASD JA has not been found to elicit STS activity ( ). On the other hand, we could not observe dmPFC activation as part of the JA network in TD children/adolescents ( ), suggesting that dmPFC involvement in JA settings may be less relevant for JA in children and adolescents and subject to further development into adulthood. \n\nThe temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is located adjacent to the STS and is known to be involved in basic spatial attention functions (in particular reorienting of attention), but has also been implicated in social and emotional processing ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ) including JA ( ,  ,  ). Several studies revealed abnormal activation patterns of the STS and TPJ in participants with ASD during various aspects of social and emotional processing ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), suggesting that both regions are critically involved in JA and also implicated in ASD. \n\nIn the context of truly interactive paradigms, it is essential to consider that social interactions depend on the relationship of the people interacting with each other ( ). In neurotypical individuals and individuals with ASD, behavior and neural responses differ as a function of how familiar the interaction partner is ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Consistently, the JA network in TD children/adolescents is modulated by the familiarity of the interaction partner ( ). It remains to be investigated whether familiarity may similarly increase or \u201camplify\u201d the motivational engagement in JA in children/adolescents with ASD. \n\nTo sum up, the present study was designed to investigate differences between young adolescents with and without ASD with respect to the (1) neural substrates of JA. We hypothesized abnormal activation patterns in areas previously implicated in ASD and JA in children and adolescents ( ), namely the STS and TPJ. Furthermore, we expected (2) a modulatory effect by the type of initiation (i.e. self- vs. other-initiation) and (3) familiarity of the interaction partner. To this end, we devised a task that used a virtual character set-up ( ,  ,  ), including both a familiar (i.e., the participant's mother) and an unfamiliar interaction partner (i.e., identical female stranger for all participants). \n\n\n## Material and methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nIn total 16 male participants with ASD between 8 and 18\u00a0years of age and 16 TD participants were included in the analyses (see  ). TD participants were selected from a larger dataset ( ) to provide a close match in age and IQ in comparison the ASD group. All participants with ASD had been diagnosed by an independent clinician and reached cut-offs on the ADOS-G (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) and ADI-R (Autism Diagnostic Interview). TD participants did not show any indication of developmental delay and had no history of any psychiatric disorder as assessed by a structured screening interview assessing various psychiatric disorders and symptoms before participation.   \nDemographic and questionnaire data. Mean values and standard deviations are given for IQ, SRS and FSK. \n  Table 1       \n\nAll participants and a caregiver filled in various questionnaires in order to assess current psychiatric disorders (Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL); ( )), screening for autistic symptoms (SCQ;  ; German version \u201cFragebogen zur sozialen Kommunikation\u201d; FSK;  ) and dimensional assessment of social functioning (Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS);  ). The FSK provides a sensitive screening for ASD (sensitivity of 92% against healthy controls). The German version of the SRS has high internal consistency between 0.91 and 0.97 ( ). The study was carried out at the Research Center J\u00fclich, Germany, and was approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital Aachen, Germany. All participants and/or their caregivers gave written informed consent/assent to participate in the study. \n\n\n### fMRI task \n  \nWe used an interactive, gaze-contingent JA task which has been described in detail elsewhere ( ). In short, participants were asked to either initiate (i.e., self-initiation) or respond (i.e., other-initiation) to gaze interactions in four different conditions that either resulted in JA or non-JA (i.e., Control) situations: (1) JA-Self, (2) Control-Self, (3) JA-Other and (4) Control-Other. \n\nAll four conditions were completed with a virtually interacting avatar that depicted an unfamiliar (i.e., identical female stranger for all participants) or a familiar interaction partner (i.e., the participant's mother) resulting in a total of eight conditions. The avatar's behavior consisted of gaze shifts towards the targets, gaze shifted downwards, and gaze contact with the participant. The virtually avatar's reaction (i.e. gaze behavior) was contingent upon the participant's gaze behavior (depending on the experimental condition, see   for details). Additionally, a low-level baseline condition was included, using a black fixation cross on a white screen displayed for 18\u00a0s. In total, the participants completed two runs, each consisting of 27 blocks, presenting each condition three times (in total 144 interaction and 18 low level baseline blocks). Blocks were presented in a pseudo-randomized order ensuring that two identical blocks were not presented in a row.   \nIllustration and timing of all condition-specific gaze-based interaction sequences (IP\u00a0=\u00a0Interaction partner). Conditions were presented in blocks of 18\u00a0s, with 3 trials per block. After each picture cue the participants completed three corresponding interaction trials (~\u00a06\u00a0s). The intertrial interval varied depending on the participant's reaction time toll fill up ~\u00a06\u00a0s before the beginning of the next trial. Note that each time indicated with tilde indicates an average time across participants ( ). \n  Fig. 1   \n\nWe used an fMRI compatible eye-tracking system (Eyelink 1000 system (SR Research, Canada)), allowing for gaze-contingent experimental set-ups. Fixation within a predefined screen area (384\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0384\u00a0pixels) centered on the targets (i.e., a piece of cheese) for at least 150\u00a0ms was required for detection of target fixation. If no target fixation was detected within 2400\u00a0ms after trial onset the next trial was shown. \n\n\n### Behavioral data \n  \nGaze data of participants were analyzed using MATLAB 8.1 and IBM SPSS Statistics 21. Onset, duration, and location of target fixation during all conditions were extracted to calculate (1) accuracy, (2) latency to JA, (3) direction of gaze shift towards the target (left, right or top), and (4) number of saccades after successful fixation of a target until the appearance of reward. General Linear Models (GLM; univariate and repeated-measures) were computed in order to test for interactions and main effects. Mixed ANOVAs with the within-group factors (JA/Control, Self/Other, Familiar/Unfamiliar) and between-group factor diagnosis (TD/ASD) were computed. Post-hoc   t  -tests were performed to determine differences between certain conditions. \n\n\n### Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) \n  \nThe fMRI protocol and analysis is identical to the one described in detail in  . In short, scans were acquired on a 3-Tesla Siemens Trio scanner (Erlangen, Germany) and analyzed using SPM8 ( ). Functional images were realigned to the mean image and co-registered with the participant's individual T1 weighted 3-D MP-RAGE image. Normalization parameters were determined and functional volumes were smoothed. Boxcar functions (aligned with the eye-tracking data) were convolved with a model of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) and its first-order temporal derivative. The unsquared and square roots of the movement parameters were included as additional regressors. All conditions were modeled separately in a block design (i.e., one block lasting 18\u00a0s) with error trials modeled as an additional nuisance regressor of no interest (i.e., trials without appearance of reward). The simple effect of each experimental condition was taken to the second-level and a random effects analysis was performed (mixed ANOVA model with within-participant factors \u2018condition\u2019 and one group factor). Initial analyses including age as a covariate revealed no influence of age (i.e., main effect and interaction) within this sample. In a second step, we examined the effect of type of initiation and familiarity separately within the ASD and TD group for specific contrasts in which activation did not exceed the threshold for statistical significance at the chosen threshold (i.e., at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 cluster-level FWE corrected (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 voxel-level). Moreover, we also investigated brain-behavior correlations in order to increase validity of our findings. The SPM8 anatomy toolbox ( ) was used to assign anatomical labels to the functional results of the second-level analysis, which were additionally compared to Brodmann and AAL templates in MRICroN. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic data and questionnaires \n  \n summarizes the sample that was included in the analyses and their average scores on the questionnaire data. As expected, ASD participants scored significantly higher on the FSK and SRS. \n\n\n### Behavioral data \n  \n#### Accuracy \n  \nSuccessful trials were noted if the participants fixated target location and hence the reward (i.e., a mouse behind the cheese) appeared at the target location. Unsuccessful trials were primarily due to technical problems or inaccuracy of the eye-tracking set-up ( ). TD participants had on average 69% successful trials and participants with ASD 73%, which were included in fMRI condition regressors. A mixed ANOVA with the within-group factors (JA/Control, Self/Other, Familiar/Unfamiliar) and the between-group factor (TD/ASD) were computed to examine significant differences between the number of errors made for specific conditions. First, there was a main effect for JA (F(1,30)\u00a0=\u00a07.04, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, \u03b7p \u00a0=\u00a00.32), with more correct trials in Control (M\u00a0=\u00a073.74%; SD\u00a0=\u00a021.00) compared to JA (M\u00a0=\u00a069.44%; SD\u00a0=\u00a020.52) conditions across groups. Second, there was a significant Self\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Familiar\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Group (F(1,30)\u00a0=\u00a010.21, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, \u03b7p \u00a0=\u00a00.25) interaction. Post-hoc paired sample   t  -test revealed that when interacting with the familiar interaction partner, TD participants had significantly more correct trials (  t  (30)\u00a0=\u00a02.31, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the other-initiated (M\u00a0=\u00a076.90%; SD\u00a0=\u00a019.60) compared to the self-initiated interactions (M\u00a0=\u00a071.53%; SD\u00a0=\u00a023.02), but no difference in accuracy between self- and other-initiation with the unfamiliar interaction partner (  t  (30)\u00a0=\u00a00.07, p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). ASD participants had significantly more correct trials (  t  (30)\u00a0=\u00a02.69, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) during interactions with the familiar interaction partner when self-initiated (M\u00a0=\u00a075.00%; SD\u00a0=\u00a020.79) than when other-initiated (M\u00a0=\u00a065.10%; SD\u00a0=\u00a024.30), and also no difference between self- and other-initiation with the unfamiliar interaction partner (  t  (30)\u00a0=\u00a00.15, p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Importantly, even though this three-way interaction was significant, differences in the average percentage of correct trials were small. Of note, all of these behavioral differences are unlikely to affect the results on the neural level, since the analyses of neural correlates only included correct trials. For a complete overview of the percentages of correct trials per condition per group please refer to Supplement Table 1. \n\n\n#### Latency to JA and NoJA \n  \nLatency was defined as the reaction time of the participant either in response to a social (i.e., JA-Other) or external non-social cue (Control-Other) or the time to freely choose a target location in response to trial onset (JA-Self/Control-Self). A mixed ANOVA with the within-group factors (JA/Control, Self/Other, Familiar/Unfamiliar) and the between-group factor (TD/ASD) revealed a significant JA x Self interaction (F(1,30)\u00a0=\u00a025.84, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, \u03b7p \u00a0=\u00a00.44) and a main effect for JA (F(1,30)\u00a0=\u00a011.61, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, \u03b7p \u00a0=\u00a00.28). Post-hoc paired sample   t  -test showed that participants were significantly faster (  t  (30)\u00a0=\u00a05.69, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in the Control-Other condition (M\u00a0=\u00a00.65; SD\u00a0=\u00a00.14) compared to the JA-Other condition (M\u00a0=\u00a00.80; SD\u00a0=\u00a00.14), but showed comparable reaction times for JA-Self and Control-Self (  t  (30)\u00a0=\u00a00.75, p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Importantly, there was no difference between TD and ASD (no main effect of group nor any interaction with group). The difference in latency for the other-initiated conditions is most likely due to the higher saliency of the external non-social cue in the Control-Other conditions compared to the more subtle gaze cue in the JA-Other condition ( ). \n\n\n#### Direction of JA \n  \nTo ensure that participants actually made choices during self-initiated conditions and selected targets at different locations, we compared the mean number of target choices for all locations. TD and ASD participants distributed their choices among all target locations (TD: top target: M\u00a0=\u00a045.77%; left target: M\u00a0=\u00a024.00%; and right target: M\u00a0=\u00a030.50%; ASD: top target: M\u00a0=\u00a048.65%; left target: M\u00a0=\u00a025.44%; and right target: M\u00a0=\u00a026.30%). In accordance with previous results ( ), participants made more gaze shifts towards the top target. A mixed ANOVA with within-group factors (JA/Control and Familiar/Unfamiliar) and between-group factor (TD/ASD) revealed no significant interaction or main effect supporting the conclusion that the preference for the top-target is due to a tendency for our technical set-up to recognize fixations at the top target most reliably ( ). \n\n\n#### Saccades: number of saccades between target fixation and reward appearance \n  \nSince participants were uncertain whether the interaction partner followed their gaze or not during self-initiated conditions, they could potentially shift their gaze back and forth between target and interaction partner. Mixed ANOVA of the number of saccades for the within-group factors (JA/Control and Familiar/Unfamiliar) and between-group factor (TD/ASD) revealed no significant interaction or main effect. On average participants shifted 2.01 times back and forth between target and interaction partner indicating that the reaction of the interaction partner was important to the participant. \n\n\n\n### Neural correlates \n  \n#### Between-group differences for joint attention (JA\u00a0>\u00a0Control) \n  \nWe hypothesized that young adolescents with ASD elicit differential activation patterns during JA compared to Control conditions in areas previously implicated in ASD and JA in children and adolescents ( ), namely the STS and TPJ. \n\n##### TD versus ASD participants \n  \nDirect comparison of engagement in JA (irrespective of type of initiation and familiarity of the interaction partner [(JA-Self\u00a0+\u00a0JA-Other)\u00a0>\u00a0(Control-Self\u00a0+\u00a0Control-Other)]) revealed a significant difference between TD and ASD participants in two clusters of brain regions (  and  ). One cluster mainly comprised the right temporal lobe including the superior temporal pole, middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and STS. A second cluster was located at the left parietal lobe including the TPJ, precuneus and inferior parietal lobe. Examination of the contrast estimates at the peak voxels of the two clusters revealed a significant group x condition interaction (F(1,30)\u00a0=\u00a08.43, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) that in the right temporal pole TD participants showed greater activation during JA than Control, while ASD participants had no significant difference in activation during JA and Control (see  B). In the left precuneus we also observed a significant group x condition interaction (F(1,30)\u00a0=\u00a014.71, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), TD participants showed a differential activation for JA and Control whereas ASD participants showed comparable activation (see  A). The inverse contrast, ASD\u00a0>\u00a0TD, did not reveal any significant difference in activation between groups. Furthermore, direct group comparisons related to specific effects for familiarity and type of initiation did not exceed the threshold for statistical significance. Therefore, in the next step, modulation of neural activation patterns by type of initiation and familiarity were examined separately within the ASD and TD group and brain-behavior correlations were investigated within the ASD group.   \nNeural correlates of the main effect for JA comparing TD\u00a0>\u00a0ASD participants and contrast estimates at the location of the corresponding peak voxel; blue: TD participants, red: ASD participants.

With respect to ASD participants we hypothesized abnormalities in self-other distinction and difficulties in initiating social interaction, probably associated with less distinct activation in brain areas underlying self- and other initiated interactions ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\n###### TD participants \n  \nInitiating the interaction regardless of JA and familiarity, that is the main effect of SELF [(JA-Self\u00a0+\u00a0Control-Self)\u00a0>\u00a0(JA-Other\u00a0+\u00a0Control-Other)], resulted in the recruitment of the superior medial frontal gyrus (FG) [(0, 30, 40),   t  \u00a0=\u00a05.58], bilateral insula [L: (\u2212\u00a036, 20, \u2212\u00a02),   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.95; R: (36, 22, \u2212\u00a06),   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.56], right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) [(46, 22, 40),   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.80] and a cluster in visual areas centered upon the left cuneus [(\u2212\u00a06, \u2212\u00a090, 18),   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.71]. \n\n\n###### ASD participants \n  \nWithin the ASD group, no significant activation at the chosen threshold was observed for the main effect of SELF. Therefore, we examined whether neural activity within the SELF-network as revealed in TD participants, was related to the severity of deficits in social communication in ASD as assessed by the respective subscale of the SRS questionnaire. This subscale captures best those skills which are necessary for self-sustained interaction, as evident during SELF conditions. The scale entails items related to initiating interactions or actively reacting to social stimuli (e.g. communicating feelings, maintaining gaze contact, entertaining relationships with peers and following the flow of a normal conversation). We used the individual SRS-Social Communication scores as a regressor and the individual contrast estimates related to SELF conditions in a whole-brain regression analysis within ASD participants, applying the SELF network of TD participants as a functional ROI. This analysis revealed the left superior medial FG [(\u2212\u00a04, 42, 38),   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.30] and MFG [(\u2212\u00a050, 28, 32),   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.72] to be correlated with the SRS-Social Communication scores, implying that less severely affected participants showed more frontal activation during self-initiated interactions. \n\n\n\n##### Common activations for other-sustained interactions (OTHER\u00a0>\u00a0SELF) \n  \nFor the main effect of OTHER [(JA-Other\u00a0+\u00a0Control-Other)\u00a0>\u00a0(JA-Self\u00a0+\u00a0Control-Self)], we hypothesized to obtain similar findings within both groups, mainly activation in visual processing areas. \n\n###### TD participants \n  \nResponding to the gaze shift by the interaction partner or to the external cue regardless of familiarity, that is the main effect of OTHER, elicited significant activation in the bilateral occipital gyrus [L: (\u2212\u00a028, \u2212\u00a096, \u2212\u00a08),   t  \u00a0=\u00a05.60; R: (30, \u2212\u00a092, 2),   t  \u00a0=\u00a07.82]. \n\n\n###### ASD participants \n  \nSimilarly, ASD participants elicited significant activation in the bilateral occipital gyrus [L: (\u2212\u00a024, \u2212\u00a094, \u2212\u00a02),   t  \u00a0=\u00a05.60; R: (26, \u2212\u00a094, \u2212\u00a02),   t  \u00a0=\u00a06.17]. \n\n\n\n##### Common activations for interactions with a familiar interaction partner (Familiar\u00a0>\u00a0Unfamiliar) \n  \nWith respect to the within-group differences for TD participants, we hypothesized that interactions with a familiar interaction partner recruit additional areas related to social and emotional processing. With respect to the within-group differences for ASD participants, we hypothesized to observe similar findings as within the TD group, yet a more pronounced differentiation in brain activation between familiar and unfamiliar interactions, which has already been reported for familiarity and face processing ( ,  ,  ). \n\n###### TD participants \n  \nInteracting with a familiar partner, regardless of JA and Self/Other, that is the main effect for FAMILIAR [(JA_Familiar\u00a0+\u00a0Control_Familiar\u00a0>\u00a0(JA_Unfamiliar\u00a0+\u00a0Control_Unfamiliar)], did not result in any significant activation at the chosen threshold. The inverse contrast, that is the main effect for UNFAMILIAR [(JA_Unfamiliar\u00a0+\u00a0Control_Unfamiliar\u00a0>\u00a0(JA_Familiar\u00a0+\u00a0Control_Familiar)], revealed no significant activation at the chosen threshold. \n\n\n###### ASD participants \n  \nIn contrast, ASD participants showed widespread activations in response to familiarity. Brain regions activated included the striatum [(\u2212\u00a012, \u2212\u00a06, \u2212\u00a08),   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.62], left insula [(\u2212\u00a028, 12, \u2212\u00a018),   t  \u00a0=\u00a03.92], temporal pole [(\u2212\u00a036, 24, \u2212\u00a022),   t  \u00a0=\u00a03.87], right IFG [(50, 32, 12),   t  \u00a0=\u00a03.98], bilateral superior medial FG [L: (\u2212\u00a08, 60, 24),   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.11; R: (8, 60, 22),   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.56], left MTG [(\u2212\u00a056, \u2212\u00a06, \u2212\u00a018),   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.47], bilateral fusiform gyrus [L: (\u2212\u00a042, \u2212\u00a056, \u2212\u00a012),   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.58; R: (42, \u2212\u00a060, \u2212\u00a016),   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.46], left precuneus [(0, \u2212\u00a060, 34),   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.56], right inferior occipital gyrus [(38, \u2212\u00a082, \u2212\u00a014),   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.46] and right precentral gyrus [(50, 8, 32),   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.27]. The inverse contrast, that is the main effect for UNFAMILIAR, did not reveal significant activation at the chosen threshold. \n\n\n\n##### Common activations for statistical interaction JA\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Self\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Familiar \n  \nWithin the TD group, we hypothesized a modulatory effect of familiarity specifically for self-initiated JA, as already described for our bigger TD developmental sample ( ). Within the ASD group, we explored whether a modulatory effect of familiarity could be observed at all, or would entail additional brain regions. \n\n###### TD participants \n  \nA significant three-way interaction was marginally evident for JA\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Self\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Familiar [(JA-Self\u00a0>\u00a0Control Self)\u00a0>\u00a0(JA-Other\u00a0>\u00a0Control-Other)] \u00a0>\u00a0[(JA-Self\u00a0>\u00a0Control-Self)\u00a0>\u00a0(JA-Other\u00a0>\u00a0Control-Other)]  in a cluster centered upon the left inferior FG [(\u2212\u00a036, 2, 30),   t  \u00a0=\u00a04.05, p\u00a0=\u00a00.085] (see  A). Post-hoc   t  -tests on beta estimates extracted from the corresponding regions revealed that the interaction was mostly driven by a familiarity effect for JA-Self (familiar\u00a0>\u00a0unfamiliar; respectively, M\u00a0=\u00a00.65, SD\u00a0=\u00a00.91 and M\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.38, SD\u00a0=\u00a00.61; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) (see  B).   \nNeural correlates for the interaction JA\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Familiarity\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Self within the TD and ASD group separately.

Post-hoc   t  -tests on beta estimates extracted from the corresponding region revealed that the interaction was mostly driven by a familiarity effect for JA-Self (familiar\u00a0>\u00a0unfamiliar; respectively, M\u00a0=\u00a00.68, SD\u00a0=\u00a00.61 and M\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.52, SD\u00a0=\u00a00.66; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) (see  B). All further interaction contrasts did not yield significant results. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis is the first study to investigate the JA network in young adolescents with ASD by using an interactive, gaze-contingent eye-tracking paradigm during fMRI. We additionally examined the effects of self- versus other-initiation and the effect of a familiar versus non-familiar interaction partner. We observed abnormal activation during JA in brain regions associated with social cognition ( ,  ) and disturbed social and emotional functioning in ASD ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\n### The general JA network \n  \nConsistent with previous research on social cognition and JA in adults ( ), we observed that JA in young adolescents with ASD resulted in deviant activation patterns in a network of areas (see  ) associated with the so-called \u201csocial brain\u201d, including the key nodes temporal pole, STS, TPJ, and precuneus ( ), despite successfully established JA on the behavioral level. Previously, we could demonstrate that in TD children and adolescents these brain regions play an important role for the experience of JA ( ). This result suggests subtle, but persistent JA difficulties in children and adolescents with ASD, despite basic functionality, which might be related to difficulties in more sophisticated social interactions, typically accompanying individuals with ASD lifelong. \n\nThe temporal pole and STS both play a key role in social and emotional processing and functional abnormalities have consistently been reported for various aspects of social processing in ASD ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). With respect to the STS, these aspects of social processing range from basic perceptual (such as recognizing a specific individual and perceiving a voice) to more complex aspects (such as analyzing perceptual cues with respect to their meaningful contribution to social communication). These processes are crucial for JA because eye movements need to be analyzed with respect to a given social context in order to extract meaningful cues for social communication ( ). Note, that we report here a rather anterior region of the STS. This is in line with various studies suggesting that in addition to posterior STS, anterior parts of the STS are also implicated in mentalizing ( ,  ,  ).   suggested that the temporal pole ties complex, highly processed perceptual inputs to instinctive emotional responses. Reduced STS and temporal pole activation in ASD, as revealed in the current study thus, could be taken to suggest less elaborate processing during basic JA within the social cognition network and might underlie the lifelong observed difficulties of ASD individuals in more complex social interactions. \n\nIn addition, adolescents with ASD showed abnormal activation in the TPJ and precuneus. These regions have previously been implicated in social information processing ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), and self-other differentiation ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The ability to differentiate mental states as originating from oneself or other people is at the heart of complex social reasoning such as in Theory of Mind (ToM) and false belief processing. Deficits in ToM and false belief processing in children with ASD have been demonstrated and persist during adolescence ( ,  ,  ). Even though explicit reasoning related to mental states (such as in a classical ToM task) was not involved, our JA task encompassed implicit inferences of the mental state of the interaction partner. In young adolescents with ASD, a ToM deficit appears to be reflected by engagement of the TPJ/precuneus for all conditions involving potential gaze interaction (i.e., JA-Self, Control-Self, JA-Other), thus pointing towards reduced neural specialization in patients, whereas in TD participants activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus is specifically apparent for successfully established JA, but not for control situations (see  A). Alternatively, this lack of condition-specific differences may reflect a higher demand on TPJ/precuneus circuitry for basic JA processes in young adolescence with ASD, as opposed to higher demands for evaluating self-initiated interactions in young TD adolescence. A similar lack of neural developmental specialization within the STS has been suggested previously in adults with ASD ( ). Both findings might thus suggest a more general lack of neural developmental specialization within \u201csocial brain\u201d areas in individuals with ASD. Interestingly, we previously observed a similar lack of specialization in TPJ recruitment during early development in TD children compared to TD adolescents ( ). The observed lack of neural developmental specialization in TPJ may thus hint at a protracted development of neural specialization in ASD. However, to disentangle this possibility from a fundamental deficiency in TPJ circuitry in JA, further studies are warranted, which need to examine the developmental trajectories during early and late adolescence in ASD in more detail by directly comparing both age groups in a bigger sample with children and adolescents with ASD. \n\n\n### JA and its modulation by type of initiation \n  \nWe also observed that parts of the network underlying self-initiated interactions correlated negatively with symptom severity in social communication in ASD. This finding might suggest that young adolescents with ASD who are more severely affected and hence have greater deficits in social communication seem to show reduced activation in frontal brain regions (i.e., MPFC) that are typically recruited during self-initiated interactions and mentalizing. This can be discussed in terms of abnormal self-other distinction ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ) or impairments in the disengagement of visual attention (see for review:  ) in individuals with ASD. First, note that the ability to differentiate oneself from others enables us to take others' perspective, which in turn is the foundation for complex social cognition such as ToM and empathy. Accordingly, individuals with ASD who are less affected had stronger activations related to self-initiated interactions as opposed to other-initiated interactions, suggesting a better self-other distinction represented in their brain. This also concords early behavioral findings, which indicate that specifically self-initiated JA is related to social-communication skills ( ). \n\nAlternatively, impairment in the disengagement of visual attention has been reported largely in individuals with ASD ( ) and has been identified as one the earliest marker in infants at high for ASD ( ,  ). In fact, a disengagement deficit may particularly affect self-initiated conditions when participants are required to voluntarily disengage their attention from the face and reorient towards one of the targets. \n\n\n### JA and its modulation by familiarity \n  \nWithin the TD and ASD group separately, we found distinct modulatory effects of familiarity. In TD participants, activation was particularly enhanced during self-initiated JA with a familiar interaction partner in the left inferior frontal gyrus (see  A), demonstrating modulation of brain regions related to attention control systems and replicating our previous findings in TD participants ( ). \n\nIn ASD participants, conditions with a familiar interaction partner elicited enhanced activation in a broad network including in the left insula, temporal pole, fusiform gyrus, precuneus, MTG, and IFG as well as the right fusiform gyrus, MFG, precentral gyrus and IFG. This is consistent with previous studies suggesting differential brain activity for familiar and unfamiliar faces in individuals with ASD ( ,  ,  ). We here indicate for the first time that a modulatory effect of familiarity in ASD is particularly valid for interactive situations. In contrast, in TD participants, we did not observe such a far-reaching effect of familiarity on brain areas. However, while we can firmly conclude that familiarity influences neural signatures of social interaction in ASD, we can only speculate whether this effect is even stronger than for TD individuals, since the direct interaction of group and familiarity did not exceed the threshold for statistical significance. However, this interesting finding resulting from the analyses within the ASD group may impact upon the development of interventions/trainings for individuals with ASD. It might be particularly beneficial to incorporate familiar others in the training so that skills to be learned can be communicated most efficiently and transferred to daily situations outside the intervention environment. \n\nThe use of the maternal face as the familiar interaction partner certainly not only includes familiarity of an observed face, but also the complex mother-child relationship, which might have far-reaching effects on social cognition in ASD. For example, specific cues related to ones own mother (e.g. maternal odors) may influence social abilities such as automatic imitation in ASD ( ). ( ). Further research is needed to disentangle familiarity and mother-child relationship and their specific influence on JA. \n\nFurthermore, we observed an interaction of type of initiation and familiarity on JA both for TD and ASD participants, but within different brain regions (see  ). Within the ASD group, an effect of familiarity was particularly evident for self-initiated JA in the right fusiform gyrus (see  B), showing enhanced activation in these situations when interacting with the mother. The right fusiform gyrus plays an important role in face processing ( ), with reduced activation in response to faces in individuals with ASD compared to healthy individuals. The fusiform gyrus has thus been suggested to underlie social interaction deficits in ASD ( ,  ,  ,  ). More recently the fusiform gyrus is also conceived as a more general \u201cexpert visual perception\u201d area ( ,  ), showing enhanced activation for any object individuals are experts in. In a single case study, enhanced activation of the fusiform gyrus has been associated with expertise in non-social stimuli such as Cartoon characters ( ). Our results now demonstrate for the first time stronger activation of the fusiform gyrus in response to a familiar face (here the own mother) in ASD, particularly in the context of self-initiated interaction. This pattern of results supports the idea that reduced activation in the fusiform gyrus in ASD may typically reflect reduced expertise in face processing as a consequence of reduced interest in social interaction ( ,  ). At the same time it suggests a greater level of facial processing for the interaction with familiar interaction partners, in particular during self-initiated interaction, again stressing the link between motivational aspects and perceptual processing of facial stimuli. \n\nInterestingly, interactions between familiarity and type of initiation on the neural level were paralleled by similar modulations of the behavioral data. While ASD participants had significantly more correct trials during self-initiated interactions with their mother as opposed to other-initiated interactions, TD participants showed a reversed pattern. In contrast, TD and ASD groups revealed no significant difference in their interactions with the unfamiliar partner. Eye movements typically become more predictable with increased exposure and familiarity ( ,  ) and our data demonstrate that familiarity of a face also influences eye movements and/or patterns of spatial attention during JA. In particular, our data suggest that ASD have a particular advantage for   initiating   interactions with a familiar interaction partner, whereas TD participants have an advantage for   following   the gaze of a familiar interaction partner. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, the present study compared for the first time brain networks associated with JA in young TD and ASD adolescents using an interactive eye-tracking and fMRI paradigm to study JA during real-time social interaction. We observed profound differences in the JA network in TD and ASD adolescents in a relative late stage of development (young adolescents). Furthermore, our data suggest a modulation of the JA network by type of initiation and \u2018familiarity\u2019 of the interaction partner within the ASD. Our results significantly extend previous findings of the behavioral and neural correlates of social interaction and communication in ASD and further advance our understanding of social cognition impairments during development. Our findings underline that even very basic forms of gaze-based social interaction (without noticeable differences in behavioral performance) are associated with profound differences in the underlying neural bases. This might have far-reaching implications for more sophisticated social interactions suggesting continued effects of JA disturbance in infants and young children with ASD into adolescence and adulthood. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: t0005\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tTD participants\tASD participants\tT\tp\tCohen's d\nN\t16\t16\t\t\t\nMale\t16\t16\t\t\t\nAge\t13.2 (3.20)\t14.2 (3.52)\t\u2212\u00a00.89\t0.382\t\nIQ\t118 (6.33)\t111???

Sign languages (i.e., visual-manual languages), like spoken languages, have complex grammatical structures and thus can provide valuable insights into the specificity and function of brain regions supporting sentence comprehension. The present study aims to characterize how these well-studied spoken language networks can adapt in adults to be responsive to sign language sentences, which contain combinatorial semantic and syntactic visual-spatial linguistic information. Twenty native English-speaking undergraduates who had completed introductory American Sign Language (ASL) courses viewed videos of the following conditions during fMRI acquisition: signed sentences, signed word lists, English sentences and English word lists. Overall our results indicate that native language (L1) sentence processing resources are responsive to ASL sentence structures in late L2 learners, but that certain L1 sentence processing regions respond differently to L2 ASL sentences, likely due to the nature of their contribution to language comprehension. For example, L1 sentence regions in Broca's area were significantly more responsive to L2 than L1 sentences, supporting the hypothesis that Broca's area contributes to sentence comprehension as a cognitive resource when increased processing is required. Anterior temporal L1 sentence regions were sensitive to L2 ASL sentence structure, but demonstrated no significant differences in activation to L1 than L2, suggesting its contribution to sentence processing is modality-independent. Posterior superior temporal L1 sentence regions also responded to ASL sentence structure but were more activated by English than ASL sentences. An exploratory analysis of the neural correlates of L2 ASL proficiency indicates that ASL proficiency is positively correlated with increased activations in response to ASL sentences in L1 sentence processing regions. Overall these results suggest that well-established fronto-temporal spoken language networks involved in sentence processing exhibit functional plasticity with late L2 ASL exposure, and thus are adaptable to syntactic structures widely different than those in an individual's native language. Our findings also provide valuable insights into the unique contributions of the inferior frontal and superior temporal regions that are frequently implicated in sentence comprehension but whose exact roles remain highly debated. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe neurobiology of sentence comprehension has been extensively studied for decades. Yet, there remains intense debate regarding the nature and specificity of contributions to sentence comprehension of several left fronto-temporal brain regions. The vast majority of the previous work regarding the neural correlates of sentence comprehension has investigated spoken languages. This work has identified a left-lateralized fronto-temporo-parietal network that is activated by the presence of sentence structures, compared to a variety of acoustic controls, with the most common regions of interest in Broca's area (posterior 2/3 of the left inferior frontal gyrus), the posterior superior temporal gyrus, and anterior temporal cortex (Dronkers et al.,  ; Hickok and Poeppel,  ; Magnusdottir et al.,  ). Although these regions are frequently identified in studies of sentence comprehension, their respective contributions remain controversial. For example, the role of Broca's area has been attributed to cognitive resources including working memory and cognitive control (Just et al.,  ; Kaan and Swaab,  ; Novick et al.,  ; Rogalsky et al.,  ; Pettigrew and Hillis,  ), hierarchical structure-building (Friederici,  ; Makuuchi et al.,  ) and syntax-specific resources (Grodzinsky,  ; Grodzinsky and Santi,  ). Anterior temporal contributions have been attributed to combinatorial semantics (Dapretto and Bookheimer,  ; Vandenberghe et al.,  ; Ferstl et al.,  ; Pallier et al.,  ; Bemis and Pylkk\u00e4nen,  ), semantic processing more generally (Wong and Gallate,  ; Wilson et al.,  ), prosody (Phillips et al.,  ; Adolphs et al.,  ; Friederici et al.,  ; Humphries et al.,  ; Johnstone et al.,  ), and basic syntactic processing (Humphries et al.,  ; Rogalsky et al.,  ; Herrmann et al.,  ). Posterior superior temporal regions also have been implicated by many of these same studies in combinatorial semantics, syntax and prosody (Humphries et al.,  ; Griffiths et al.,  ; Wilson et al.,  ), as well as in lexical and phonological processing (Damasio et al.,  ; Hickok and Poeppel,  ; Graves et al.,  ). \n\nThe present study aims to investigate the response properties of these spoken language sentence-processing regions to American Sign Language (ASL) sentences in normal hearing adults who are novice ASL learners. Previous studies of the neural substrates of sign languages (i.e., visual-manual languages) have provided valuable insights into the specificity and function of language processing brain networks. Sign languages, like spoken languages, have complex grammatical structures, sublexical features, and many other similar linguistic properties (Emmorey et al.,  ; Sandler and Lillo-Martin,  ). Thus, by comparing across languages in different modalities, major strides have been made regarding understanding the overall organization and properties of the human brain's language systems independent of modality (Emmorey and McCullough,  ). Studies investigating the neural substrates of sign languages in native deaf signers (i.e., individuals who have been deaf from a young age and learned a sign language from birth or in childhood) have found that native signers and native speakers engage highly overlapping brain networks during both language production and comprehension. For example, functional MRI studies of native deaf signers consistently indicate that ASL sentences activate the classic left hemisphere language network, including Broca's area, and anterior and posterior portions of the left superior temporal gyrus (Neville et al.,  ; Corina and McBurney,  ; Emmorey et al.,  ; Sakai et al.,  ). In addition, studies of native deaf signers who have focal brain damage due to a stroke indicate that sign aphasias result from lesion patterns very similar to those typically associated with spoken language aphasias (e.g., left frontal damage in Broca's aphasia, left temporal/parietal damage in fluent aphasias, etc.) (Hickok et al.,  ; Emmorey et al.,  ; Rogalsky et al.,  ). \n\nPrevious studies of bimodal bilinguals who acquired both sign and spoken languages early (i.e., before puberty) also indicate substantial overlap between brain regions engaged in comprehending spoken and signed words (Petitto et al.,  ; MacSweeney et al.,  ,  ,  ; Leonard et al.,  ). For example, Mayberry et al. ( ) find the same left-lateralized network engaged in lexical-semantic processing for both early acquired spoken and sign languages. Event related potential (ERP) findings also indicate that grammatical and semantic errors elicit similar ERP responses for both sign and spoken languages in native hearing signers (Neville et al.,  ; Bavelier et al.,  ). Together, these sign language findings suggest that when acquired early, spoken and sign languages share abstract linguistic properties and that the components of language processing and acquisition occur largely independent from modality of input (Hickok et al.,  ; Corina and McBurney,  ; Emmorey,  ), although there are some known language modality differences, particularly in parietal regions (Emmorey et al.,  ,  ; Pa et al.,  ). \n\nStudying late bimodal bilingualism (e.g., a native English-speaking adult learning American Sign Language) can lead to a better understanding of the neurobiology of late second language acquisition (Leonard et al.,  ). For example, spoken language bilingual studies cannot alone determine if how the adult brain adapts to novel lexical-semantic mappings and syntactic structures is dependent upon the modality of presentation, or if, for example, auditory speech regions involved in lexical processing can also adapt to lexical-semantic processing of manual signs in adulthood (i.e., well after any language critical period). No previous studies to our knowledge have investigated syntactic or sentence-level processing in late bimodal bilinguals, but the few existing neuroimaging studies addressing lexical-semantic processing in late bimodal bilingualism are summarized below. \n\nLeonard et al. ( ) examined the neural correlates of late L2 ASL in hearing L1 English speakers who completed 40 h of ASL college-level coursework. Leonard et al. found that a single-word semantic task (word-picture matching) in spoken English, written English, and ASL, all evoked a very similar left-lateralized fronto-temporal network, and that ASL also engaged a right inferior parietal region more so than spoken or written English. Right inferior parietal regions also previously have been identified as an ASL-specific area of activation in early ASL-English bilinguals (Newman et al.,  ). Seemingly in conflict with these findings of right hemisphere engagement during late L2 ASL acquisition, Williams et al.'s. ( ) longitudinal study of word-level processes in adult novice L2 sign language learners found that as a semester of ASL instruction progressed, left hemisphere activation increased while right hemisphere involvement decreased, in part leading to an increase in overlap with L1 neural correlates. This right-to-left hemisphere shift in activation as a function of proficiency is also seen in L2 spoken languages (Dehaene et al.,  ; Meschyan and Hernandez,  ), and may reflect reduced engagement of domain-general cognitive control and attention resources. For example, lower L2 sign proficiency was associated with bilateral activation in the caudate nucleus and anterior cingulate cortex, neural structures previous implicated in spoken language control and cognitive control more generally (Friederici,  ; Abutalebi,  ; Zou et al.,  ). Thus, the initial right parietal involvement but overall decline in right hemisphere involvement may reflect a shift from more domain-general resources to L1 processing networks for ASL L2, in addition to engagement of an \u201cASL-specific\u201d right parietal region. \n\nOverall the findings from late L2 ASL studies of word-level processing suggest that lexical-semantic networks are amodal and can quickly adapt to lexical-semantic information coming from a novel modality, particularly in individuals with higher L2 sign proficiency. However, it remains unknown if this finding expands to sentence structure: can the brain networks that support sentence-level syntactic processing in spoken languages also adapt to the visual-spatial syntactic cues of a signed language? \n\nOne might assume that if lexical resources can adapt to a different modality, then syntactic resources logically could do so in kind. However, spoken language syntactic cues include temporal and/or auditory-verbal information such as word order, conjugation and declension (morphosyntactic cues), punctuation and/or prosodic inflections, while sign language syntactic cues come in the form of visual-spatial information including location in space, movements, and face, head, and body positions. There is a robust literature of findings indicating distinct neural resources that process visual-spatial information compared to verbal information, the most general of which is that the right hemisphere is more tuned to visual-spatial information while the left hemisphere is more specialized for language (Gazzaniga,  ,  ). For example, dissociations of visual-spatial and linguistic (including syntactic) impairments after brain injury or disease are well-documented in spoken language users (e.g., Glosser and Goodglass,  ; Mosidze et al.,  ; Baldo et al.,  ) . Evidence from spoken language bilingual studies also suggests a possible dissociation between the adaptability of semantic and syntactic neural resources: age of L2 acquisition has a greater effect than proficiency on the overlap of the neural correlates of L1 and L2 syntactic processing, while semantic neural resources are more affected by proficiency than age of acquisition (Weber-Fox and Neville,  ; Wartenburger et al.,  ). Thus, it is unknown if the visual-spatial nature of syntactic information in sign languages affects the ability of established spoken language syntactic processing resources to adapt to new syntactic cues. Further, it is unclear if understanding the flexibility of spoken L1 sentence-processing resources in ASL L2 is a worthy pursuit to better understand the response properties and adaptability of these syntactic resources critical for human language. \n\nOne confound in investigating the neural differences and similarities of a spoken L1 and a late sign L2 is that it may not be clear if effects are due to differences in proficiency, age of acquisition, and/or the languages being in different modalities and thus having different syntactic features. However, there is a large literature in spoken language bilingualism on the variables of proficiency, age of acquisition, and syntactic similarity to inform findings in bimodal bilinguals (for thorough reviews, please see Caffarra et al.,   and Kotz,  ). Some of the most relevant findings in spoken language studies for interpreting our findings in this present study of L2 ASL syntactic processing include: (1) there is a \u201csyntactic similarity effect\u201d in that the similarity of the neural correlates of L1 and L2 are greater for languages that have similar syntactic features and structure types (Ojima et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ; Jeong et al.,  ), (2) late L2 learners can exhibit native-like ERP signatures during L2 comprehension when proficiency is high (Rossi et al.,  ; Tanner et al.,  ), (3) significant bilateral superior temporal activation is found for most L1 and L2s regardless of proficiency or age of onset although activation in this region is positively correlated with proficiency (Perani et al.,  ; Jeong et al.,  ), and (4) the inferior frontal gyrus is engaged more in late L2 than in L1 comprehension, particularly for low L2 proficiency (R\u00fcschemeyer et al.,  ,  ; Hernandez et al.,  ; Jeong et al.,  ). Together the last two points suggest what R\u00fcschemeyer et al. ( ,  ) call a \u201ctrade off\u201d between inferior frontal and superior temporal involvement, with greater IFG involvement as a function of L2 and lower proficiency and greater STG involvement for L1 and higher proficiency L2. These findings likely point to the IFG supporting the learning of syntactic rules (as IFG also has been identified in studies of artificial grammar, e.g., Opitz and Friederici,  ; Friederici et al.,  ). \n\nThe present study compares the brain networks engaged in ASL sentence comprehension in adult novice L2 ASL learners to those involved in L1 spoken language sentence comprehension. This work expands the very small literature on the neurobiology of late bimodal second language acquisition; to our knowledge no previous study has examined the brain networks supporting ASL sentence comprehension in late bimodal bilinguals. Our aim is to characterize the functional plasticity of auditory sentence processing regions for sentence structures that have similar grammatical complexity, but are represented visually and visuo-spatially, in hearing adults who are novice sign language users. We hypothesize the following: (1) ASL and English sentences will activate highly overlapping frontal-temporal networks, (2) ASL sentences will elicit more activation in Broca's area than English sentences, likely because of Broca's area contributing to sentence comprehension as a cognitive resource, (3) ASL and English sentences will engage sentence processing resources in anterior and posterior temporal regions to a similar degree, and (4) ASL sentence comprehension proficiency will be negatively correlated with right hemisphere involvement. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty participants were recruited from Arizona State University's (ASU) American Sign Language undergraduate program in the Department of Speech and Hearing Science. Participants (one male; age range = 18\u201331 years, mean age = 21.4 years) met the following criteria: native speaker of American English, mono-lingual, right handed, previous completion of two semester-long (15 week) introductory courses of American Sign Language (i.e., ASL 101 and 102 at ASU or equivalent at a community college) and current enrollment in an upper division ASL course at the time of participation (ASL 201:   n   = 8, ASL 202:   n   = 12). The large percentage of participants who were female reflect the gender ratio in the ASL courses sampled. Participants reported no history of neurological or psychological disease, which was corroborated by a clinical neuroradiologist who reviewed the structural MRI scans. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Institutional Review Boards of ASU and St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center with written informed consent from all subjects. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the ASU Institutional Review Board and the St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center Institutional Review Board. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nDuring fMRI acquisition, blocks of four types of stimuli were presented: ASL sentences, ASL word lists, English sentences, and English word lists. Each are described below. All ASL stimuli were digitally recorded and edited using AdobeSuite Premiere\u00ae software. \n\n#### ASL sentences \n  \nThe words used to generate the ASL sentences were taken from common nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs presented in vocabulary lists used by first year ASL courses in which participants were previously enrolled (i.e., ASL 101, ASL 102). From this vocabulary corpus, 15 ASL sentences were generated by a fluent ASL instructor (author P.H.) who added place, movement, and expression (i.e., the inflectional morphology). P.H. has been a college ASL instructor for over 30 years, and is a certified interpreter. The sentences also were reviewed by a native deaf signer (age 22, acquired ASL from birth, not a student or colleague of P.H.). \n\nASL sentences ranged from 5 to 10 signs long (  M   = 7.6) and consisted of a variety of sentence structures and clause types (e.g., \u201cGrandmother was upset that father forgot to pick up his daughter from school,\u201d \u201cYesterday the secretary answered the phone when the boss left\u201d). A total of 15 sentences were used during scanning, while a different 10 sentences were used for the ASL proficiency measure, described below. During scanning each ASL sentence presentation block consisted of one ASL sentence and the mean duration of each block was 6.9 s (5\u20138 s). \n\n\n#### ASL word lists \n  \nFifteen ASL word lists were generated from the common nouns utilized in the ASL sentences. Each word list was comprised of seven nouns. All ASL sentences and word lists were signed by the same fluent signer (P.H.). During the word lists, the signer returned her hands to her lap between each signed word. The mean duration of each ASL word list block was 14.5 s (14\u201316 s). \n\n\n#### English sentences \n  \nThirty English sentences were generated by translating into English the 15 ASL sentences used in ASL sentence blocks, plus 15 additional sentences generated from the same ASL vocabulary corpus. English sentences ranged from 8 to 16 words (  M   = 11.3). Presentation of the English stimuli are based on Fedorenko et al. ( ) language localizer paradigm: English stimuli were presented as white text against a dark gray background. Each word in the sentence was visually presented for 350 ms. Sentences ranged in duration from 2.8 to 5.6 s (  M   = 3.9 s). Each English sentence presentation block consisted of two English sentences, which were separated by a 700 ms fixation cross. The duration of the blocks ranged from 8.8 to 9.5 s (  M   = 9 s). \n\n\n#### English word lists \n  \nFifteen English word lists were generated by translating the items in the ASL word lists and additional ASL nouns from the vocabulary corpus. Each word list contained 14 nouns. Each word was presented for 350 ms resulting in a total duration of 4.9 s for each word list. \n\n\n\n### ASL sentence comprehension proficiency task \n  \nPrior to scanning, each participants' proficiency on ASL sentences (created in the same fashion as the ones presented during fMRI acquisition) was assessed outside the scanner. The proficiency test was comprised of 10 novel ASL sentences and each sentence contained an average of 7 (range = 5\u201311) ASL words from the vocabulary corpus. Participants were instructed to view each video once and translate the ASL sentence into English on paper provided (see Supplementary Video   for an example of an ASL sentence video). Once they completed the test, the subject's translations were given two scores: a semantic and a syntactic score. In the semantic scoring, the vocabulary words from each sentence were scored on whether each word was correctly translated or not. If a word was translated incorrectly, the response was categorized as a semantic error, a phonological error (based on the four parameters of sign language, i.e., hand movement, hand shape, position of hand, and orientation of the sign to the body), or omission. In the syntactic scoring, the translations were scored based on the correct relation of each word to the other word in the sentence (e.g., who was the agent, what is modifying what, etc.). The average number of relations in the sentences was 5 (range = 3\u20136). Correct scoring of the relations was not dependent on comprehension of lexical items. For example, the ASL sentence in Video 1, translated into English as \u201cMy uncle was driving fast and he sped past the woman in the car\u201d has four relations to comprehend: (1) who is driving, (2) what is fast, (3) who sped, and (4) who was sped past. Semantic and syntactic scores were calculated as proportion correct of the number of words and number of relations, respectively, averaged across all sentences. \n\n\n### fMRI experimental design \n  \nThe scanning session contained four functional runs with the order counter-balanced across participants. Within each run pseudo-randomized blocks of the four conditions (i.e., ASL sentences, ASL word lists, English sentences, and English word lists) were presented, with rest periods of 12 s interleaved between blocks. In each run, there were equal numbers of blocks from each condition. There were a total of 16 blocks in three of the runs and 12 blocks in one run. After functional scanning, a T1 structural MRI was collected. The whole scanning session lasted approximately 50 min. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nMRI scanning was performed on a 3T Philips Achieva scanner at the Keller Center for Imaging Innovation at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona. During scanning, participants laid supine and viewed the display through Nordic Neurolab's MR-compatible high-resolution LED goggles. The visual display was synchronized to image acquisition via Neurolab's sync system with E-prime Software Version 2 (Psychology Software Tools,  ). The parameters for the functional runs were as follows: 35 axial-oblique slices (3 mm thickness), in-plane resolution = 3 \u00d7 3 mm,   TR   = 2 s,   TE   = 25 ms, flip angle = 80\u00b0, FOV = 240 \u00d7 240 mm, matrix = 80 \u00d7 80, and ascending acquisition. The number of volumes acquired for the four runs were 172, 174, 174, and 132 respectively. The parameters for the high-resolution T1 anatomical scan were as follows: MPRAGE sequence, 170 sagittal slices, TR = 6.742 ms,   TE   = 3.104 ms, flip angle = 9\u00b0, matrix = 256 \u00d7 256, voxel size = 1.1 \u00d7 1.1 \u00d7 1.2 mm. \n\n\n### fMRI data preprocessing and analysis \n  \nImage preprocessing and analyses were completed using SPM8 (SPM8, Wellcome Institute of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). Standard preprocessing steps were implemented, including slice time correction, rigid body motion correction, a high-pass filter at 1/128 Hz to filter low-frequency nonlinear drifts, coregistration of the functional images to each subject's T1 anatomical images, and normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template. All normalized functional images were smoothed using a Gaussian filter with a full width at half maximum of 8 mm. \n\nIndividual subject analyses were conducted by constructing a general linear model for each condition. Four regressors were defined: ASL sentences, ASL word lists, English sentences, and English word lists. For all conditions, the regressors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (Friston et al.,  ). Voxel-wise repeated measure   t  -tests were performed using the estimated parameters of the regressors (beta weights) to compare across conditions. For group analysis, a random effects analysis was conducted by incorporating the individual data from the first-level analysis of each task. The group results were overlaid onto the averaged normalized anatomical image of the group by using an SPM extension tool, bspmVIEW ( ). Significant clusters were identified using non-parametric permutation and randomization techniques via the SnPM13 toolbox of SPM12 (Nichols and Holmes,  ;  ) and a voxel-wise FWE-threshold of   p   < 0.05. \n\nTo further investigate how L1 English sentence regions respond to L2 ASL sentences, regions of interest (ROIs) were functionally defined based on the contrast of English sentences\u2013English word lists. The amplitude of the response within each ROI for each condition were then plotted and compared with two-way ANOVAs (language x stimulus type). \n\nLastly, we conducted correlation analyses to examine the relationship between activation to ASL sentences and an individual's ASL proficiency score. To do so we calculated a Pearson   r  -value in each voxel between the beta values and proficiency scores from each subject. Note that this correlational approach is most likely underpowered in our sample, as power curve estimates computed by Yarkoni and Braver ( ) indicate that a sample size of approximately 50 is needed for sufficient power (0.8) while maintaining a conservative probability of false positives in typical fMRI experiments. Nonetheless we conducted the correlational analyses as this is a difficult population from which to achieve an adequate sample size. Also note that we have used a more relaxed statistical threshold for these results (voxel-wise uncorrected of   p   < 0.005, with a cluster size threshold = 10 voxels). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### ASL sentence comprehension behavioral measure \n  \nASL sentence comprehension behavioral task performance (proportion correct) was as follows: semantic scores ranged from 0.23 to 0.72 (  M   = 0.54). Syntactic scores ranged from 0.12 to 0.8 (  M   = 0.52). There was a strong positive correlation between the semantic and syntactic proficiency scores,   r   = 0.807,   p   < 0.001 (Figure  ). Thus, in subsequent fMRI analyses that correlate activations with ASL sentence comprehension abilities, an overall proficiency score (i.e., an average of semantic and syntactic scores for each participant) was used. \n  \nScatterplot of the syntactic and semantic scores on the behavioral ASL sentence comprehension task for each participant. \n  \n\n### fMRI results: L1 English \n  \nAs observed in previous studies of sentence comprehension (Humphries et al.,  ; Vandenberghe et al.,  ; Rogalsky and Hickok,  ; Rogalsky et al.,  ), English sentences and word lists each activated large bilateral swaths of cortex in the frontal, temporal and inferior parietal lobes, as well as visual cortex (  p   < 0.05, FWE-corrected Figure  , Table  ). For English sentences, widespread significant activations were identified in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), right angular gyrus (AG), bilateral precentral gyrus (PrCG), inferior frontal gyri (IFG, predominately in the pars opercularis), superior temporal gyrus (STG), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), lingual gyrus, inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), middle occipital gyrus (MOG), fusiform gyrus, calcarine sulcus, and supplementary motor area (SMA). In the English word list condition, significant activations were found in the bilateral IFG (pars opercularis), precentral gyrus, MFG, IOG, MOG, lingual gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and SMA superior parietal lobule (SPL), right MTG, AG, and insula (Figure  , Table  ). \n  \nMaps of significant activations for   (A)   English sentences,   (B)   English word lists,   (C)   ASL sentences, and   (D)   ASL word lists compared to rest, FWE corrected,   p   < 0.05. \n    \nActivation clusters for reading English stimuli. \n  \n Coordinates are reported in MNI space. The bold text indicates the peak voxel for that cluster. All clusters listed are significant at FWE-corrected p < 0.05. Regions: angular gyrus (AG); fusiform gyrus (FG); inferior frontal gyrus (IFG); inferior occipital gyrus (IOG); inferior parietal lobule (IPL); lingual gyrus (LG); middle frontal gyrus (MFG); medial frontal gyrus (MeFG); middle occipital gyrus (MOG); middle temporal gyrus (MTG); precentral gyrus (PrCG); superior frontal gyurs (SFG); superior temporal gyrus (STG); supplementary motor area (SMA); superior occipital gyrus (SOG)  . \n  \nClusters more active for rest than the English sentences were identified bilaterally in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG), AG, cuneus, cingulate gyrus, medial frontal gyrus (MeG) and pons, in the left MOG and STG, and in the R MFG (Figure  ; Table  ). Clusters more active for rest than the English word lists were found in the bilateral CG, cuneus and medial occipital lobe, including LG and MOG, as well as a small cluster (4 voxels) in the right STG (Figure  ; Table  ). \n\nA voxel-wise   t  -test of English sentences vs. English word lists revealed increased activation for English sentences compared to word lists in the bilateral temporal lobes in the STG and MTG (right anterior temporal lobe, left activation spanned the length of the temporal lobe), as well as the left IFG (pars opercularis and pars triangularis) and MeG (Figure  ; Table  ). Clusters more active for the English word lists than the English sentences were identified in bilateral CG and occipital regions including MG, SOG, and FG, as well as in the right inferior parietal lobule (Figure  ). \n  \nContrast results for   (A)   English sentences > English word lists,   (B)   English word lists > English sentences,   (C)   ASL sentences > ASL word lists,   (D)   ASL word lists > ASL sentences but no voxels survived correction,   (E)   conjunction of ASL sentences > rest and English sentences > rest, and   (F)   ASL sentences vs. English sentences; in   (F)  , warmer colors indicate greater activation for ASL sentences and cooler colors indicate greater activation for English sentences (FWE corrected,   p   < 0.05). \n  \n\n### fMRI results: L2 ASL \n  \nLarge swaths of activations were found in response to ASL sentences compared to rest in the bilateral visual cortex, extending both into posterior superior temporal and inferior parietal cortex, as well as the SPL and postcentral gyrus. Bilateral frontal regions including IFG (pars orbitalis, opercularis and triangularis), MFG, precentral gyrus and SMA also contained significant activations, in addition to bilateral hippocampus and left pallidum (  p   < 0.05, FWE-corrected, Figure  , Table  ). ASL word lists compared to rest activated a similar set of regions as the ASL sentences, including bilateral SPL, IPL, cuneus,PrCG, IFG, MFG, insula, SOG, inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), FG, hippocampus, and SMA (Figure  , Table  ). \n  \nActivation clusters for viewing ASL stimuli. \n  \n Coordinates are reported in MNI space. The bold text indicates the peak voxel for that cluster. All clusters listed are significant at voxel-wise FWE p < 0.05. Regions: fusiform gyrus (FG); inferior frontal gyrus (IFG); inferior occipital gyrus (IOG); inferior pariatel lobule (IPL); inferior temporal gyrus (ITG); lingual gyrus (LG); middle frontal gyrus (MFG); medial frontal gyrus (MeFG); middle temporal gyrus (MTG); postcentral gyrus (PoCG); precentral gyrus (PrCG); superior occipital gyrus (SOG); superior temporal gyrus (STG); supplementary motor area (SMA); supramarginal gyrus (SMaG)  . \n  \nClusters more active during rest than ASL sentences were identified in the bilateral AG, STG, MTG, CG, MFG, MeFG, hippocampus, and insula, as well as the right putamen (Figure  , Table  ). Clusters more active during rest than ASL word lists include portions of bilateral STG, Heschl's gyrus, AG, MFG, SFG, MeG, and CG, precuneus, as well as left caudate (Figure  , Table  ). \n\nA voxel-wise   t  -test of ASL sentences vs. ASL word lists identified clusters in bilateral STG, MTG, SMA, in occipital cortex with peaks in FG, IOG, precuneus and in the calcarine sulcus, as well as in the left pre and postcentral gyri (Figure  , Table  ). No regions were more active in response to ASL word lists than ASL sentences (Figure  ). \n\n\n### fMRI results: L2 ASL vs. L1 English \n  \nA conjunction map of the brain regions significantly activated by ASL sentences and by English sentences was generated to describe shared vs. distinct sentence processing regions for the two types of sentences (Figure  ). Areas of overlap were found bilaterally in the frontal lobe (bilateral IFG\u2013predominately pars opercularis, MFG and precentral gyrus), posterior superior and middle temporal gyri, and bilateral occipital visual cortex. Notably the spatial extent of activation was greater for ASL sentences than English sentences in the inferior parietal lobe, superior parietal lobule, and inferior frontal gyrus. The response to English sentences compared to ASL sentences extended more anteriorly along the left superior temporal sulcus, although ASL sentences did elicit significant activation in a small cluster in the left anterior temporal lobe (45 voxels) (Figure  ). \n\nTo further examine the differences between the neuroanatomy supporting the comprehension of ASL sentences and English sentences, we also directly compared the activation between these two conditions in a voxel-wise   t  -test (Figure  ; Table  ). ASL sentences yielded significantly greater activation than English sentences in bilateral SPL, occipital-inferior temporal cortex including SOG, ITG and the calcarine sulcus, IFG (both pars opercularis and pars triangularis in the left hemisphere), insula, and SMA, as well as in the left PrCG, and right hippocampus. English sentences yielded significantly greater activation than ASL sentences in bilateral MTG, AG, IPL, and occipital regions including peaks in the LG and IOG (Figure  ; Table  ). \n  \nActivation clusters for the contrast between ASL sentences and English sentences. \n  \n Coordinates are reported in MNI space. The bold text indicates the peak voxel for that cluster. All clusters listed are significant at voxel-wise FWE p < 0.05. Regions: angular gyrus (AG); inferior frontal gyrus (IFG); inferior occipital gyrus (IOG); inferior parietal lobule (IPL); inferior temporal gyrus (ITG); lingual gyrus (LG); middle occipital gyrus (MOG); middle temporal gyrus (MTG); precentral gyrus (PrCG); superior occipital gyrus (SOG); supplementary motor area (SMA)  . \n  \n\n### Response of L1 English regions to L2 ASL sentences \n  \nTo explore how ASL sentences engage English sentence processing regions, we plotted the mean percent signal change during each condition for the regions identified to be significantly more activated for English sentences than word lists, (  p   < 0. 05, FWE-corrected). As described in section fMRI Results: L2 ASL vs. L1 English, the regions identified were in the left inferior frontal gyrus, left anterior and posterior superior temporal gyrus, and right anterior temporal gyrus (Figure  ). 2 \u00d7 2 ANOVAs were computed for each ROI. The results are as follows (\u03b1 = .05): The left anterior temporal ROI (Figure  ) exhibited a significant main effect of sentence structure,   F   = 67.4,   p   < 0.001; English and ASL sentences exhibit greater activation than word lists in their respective modality. The main effect of language was not significant,   F   = 3.5,   p   = 0.07. There was no significant interaction in the left anterior temporal ROI [  F   = 1.75,   p   = 0.20]. The left posterior STG ROI (Figure  ) exhibited a main effect for stimulus type [sentences >word lists;   F   = 98.7,   p   < 0.001], and main effect for modality [English >ASL,   F   = 7.5,   p   = 0.01]; the interaction was not significant (  p   = 0.24). These findings suggest that this left posterior temporal region is sensitive to sentence structure in both L1 and L2, but with a preference for L1. The left IFG ROI (Figure  ) exhibited a significant main effect for sentence structure [  F   = 28.2,   p   < 0.001] with sentences activating the ROI more than word lists, as well as a significant main effect of language [  F   = 18.8,   p   < 0.001], with ASL significantly activating more than English; the interaction was not significant (  p   = 0.23). The right anterior temporal ROI (Figure  ) exhibited a significant main effect for sentences than word lists, [  F   = 54.3,   p   < 0.001], but no significant main effect of language (  p   = 0.21) or interaction (  p   = 0.33). To summarize these ROI results, no ROIs showed an interaction, only the L pSTG ROI was significantly activated more for English than ASL, and the reverse was found in the L IFG, in which ASL led to greater activation than English. All of the ROIs were significantly more activated for sentences than word lists. These findings suggest that L1 English sentence comprehension networks are also engaged during L2 ASL sentence comprehension, albeit to varying degrees. \n  \n (A)   ROIs defined by English sentences > English word lists (FWE corrected,   p   < 0.05).

Error bars represent standard error of the mean. \n  \n\n### Exploratory fMRI results: ASL proficiency \n  \nTo determine whether the engagement of English sentence processing regions during ASL sentence comprehension is dependent on level of ASL proficiency, we conducted correlation analyses to examine the relationship between activation to ASL sentences and an individual's ASL proficiency score. Although this approach is likely underpowered in our sample (Yarkoni and Braver,  ), we nonetheless present results as this is a difficult population from which to achieve an adequate sample size. The following results are therefore exploratory in nature and null results should be interpreted with great caution. \n\nA positive correlation between ASL proficiency score and activation in response to ASL sentences compared to rest was found in the left IFG (pars opercularis) (peak   r   = \u221258 14 26), left IFG (pars orbitalis) (\u221244 34 \u22122), left posterior STG (\u221246 \u221240 16), and the right MFG (58 4 28) (  p   < 0.005, minimum cluster size = 10 voxels Figure  ). These positive correlations suggest that the activation of these regions while viewing ASL sentences is associated with increased levels of ASL proficiency. Note that all of these regions identified as related to ASL proficiency are a subset of those found to be activated by English sentences compared to rest. \n  \n (A)   Regions in which activation to ASL sentences > rest is correlated with ASL proficiency.

Arrows   (A,B)   point to regions with activations that positively correlate with ASL, arrows   (C\u2013E)   point to regions that negatively correlate. \n  \nA second correlational analysis was conducted to focus more specifically on ASL sentence comprehension; a correlation was computed for the relationship between greater activation to ASL sentences compared to English sentences and an individual's ASL proficiency score. Positive correlations between ASL proficiency and activation in response to ASL sentences (minus English sentences) were observed in the left IFG (pars opercularis) (\u221258 6 22) and left posterior STG (\u221264 \u221242 14) (Figure  ). A negative correlation in the left temporal-occipital gyrus (extending into the fusiform gyrus) (\u221238 \u221268 \u221214), left superior frontal gyrus (\u221214 60 28), and left supramarginal/angular gyrus (\u221246 \u221268 38) (Figure  ) was also observed. These negative correlations indicate that greater activation for ASL vs. English in these regions is associated with decreased levels of ASL proficiency. The regions with positive correlations to ASL proficiency also are activated by English sentences, but the regions with negative correlations do not overlap with the activations to English sentences. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study investigated the brain regions involved in sentence processing of ASL in novice L2 adult hearing signers. Our aim was to determine how L1 spoken language sentence processing networks respond to L2 ASL sentences. Overall our results combined with previous work indicate that ASL syntactic processing engages brain regions that are highly overlapping with typical spoken language L1 language networks, independent of proficiency or age of acquisition. In other words, modality alone does not substantially modulate the location of the neural substrates of sentence processing resources, which leads us to conclude that spoken L1 language processing networks can quickly adapt to L2 syntactic structure that is highly unrelated to the syntactic structure of L1. \n\nThese findings coincide with separate previous functional neuroimaging studies of spoken language bilingualism and early bimodal bilingualism, suggesting that age of acquisition and modality may not necessarily impact macro neural organization of L2 (Abutalebi et al.,  ; Emmorey et al.,  ). However, each of the L1 sentence comprehension regions were modulated differently by L2 ASL vs. L1 English sentences, providing valuable insights into the nature of each region's contributions to L1 sentence processing (discussed below). Our exploratory analyses of ASL L2 proficiency indicate that greater ASL proficiency is positively correlated with greater activation of both left frontal and posterior temporal sentence processing regions, and negatively correlated with activation in visual and visual-spatial processing regions. The implications of our findings regarding the response properties and flexibility of sentence-processing networks are discussed below. \n\n### Contributions of age of acquisition and proficiency vs. modality to ASL sentence processing \n  \nIn the present study alone, it is not possible to differentiate between the contributions of age of acquisition, proficiency, and language modality to our findings. However, the relative wealth of literature in spoken language bilingualism investigating effects of age of acquisition and proficiency, and (to a lesser degree) in early bimodal bilingualism investigating modality effects in the neural correlates of sentence processing, allows us to interpret our results in a meaningful way to better understand the nature and response properties of sentence processing regions. \n\nIn studies of early bimodal bilinguals, there is a high degree of overlap between the neural correlates of sign and spoken sentence comprehension (Neville et al.,  ; Bavelier et al.,  ) suggesting that the neural resources supporting sentence comprehension are largely independent of modality. In our late L2 ASL signers, we also find a high degree of overlap, particularly in inferior frontal and posterior temporal cortex, suggesting that the functional plasticity of spoken language sentence processing regions also is not dependent upon an early age of acquisition and/or high degree of proficiency. Based on previous work in spoken language bilinguals, we expect this overlap to further increase as proficiency improves, even in late L2 learners (Rossi et al.,  ; Tanner et al.,  ). \n\nThe overlap we found in bilateral superior temporal cortex for sentence-specific processing (vs. word lists) in both L1 English and L2 ASL, particularly in pSTG, also speaks to the adaptability of these well-investigated L1 sentence processing regions. Previous work in spoken languages has demonstrated that they are engaged during sentence processing regardless of age of acquisition or proficiency (Perani et al.,  ; Jeong et al.,  ), and bilateral STG involvement also has been found in ASL acquired from an early age (Neville et al.,  ). Our study suggests that even in late L2 learning, bilateral superior temporal cortex is responsive to syntactic structures in a different modality. \n\nThe age of L2 acquisition is quite similar across our participants, as they all were young adult undergraduates. Thus, any differences detected in our exploratory proficiency correlational analyses are likely due to proficiency differences, not age of acquisition. While there is some variability in proficiency in our sample (Figure  ), certainly future longitudinal studies are needed to better understand how L2 proficiency would affect our findings. But, within our sample, an interesting pattern of activations in the left hemisphere was found to correlate with ASL proficiency: greater activations to ASL sentences than English sentences in regions responsive to English sentences in Broca's area and the pSTG (i.e., regions activated by English sentences in the present study and in numerous previous studies) were associated with greater ASL proficiency. Conversely, greater activation to ASL sentences compared to English sentences in visual-spatial occipital and parietal left hemisphere regions were significantly correlated with lower ASL proficiency. This intra-hemispheric difference in contributions of visual-spatial regions and L1 language regions as a function of ASL proficiency in our late L2 signers suggests that their ASL exposure may be sufficient to expand the response properties of L1 spoken language regions to L2 ASL. The alternative explanation would be that our more proficient ASL signers naturally engage L1 language regions in response to ASL even prior to the development of ASL proficiency. However, this explanation is unlikely to be correct: previous work indicates that in response to ASL vs. non-linguistic biological motion, non-signers exhibit significantly more activation in visual processing regions such as the occipito-temporo-parietal junction, whereas signer significantly more activate known peri-sylvian language regions (Malaia et al.,  ). \n\nIn the next three sections, we review in more detail the findings in the three regions most frequently implicated in sentence processing in the neurobiology of language literature more generally. \n\n\n### Broca's area \n  \nA portion of Broca's area, the pars opercularis, was found to be more activated by English sentences compared to English word lists. This finding coincides with numerous previous neuroimaging studies of L1 spoken languages that report greater Broca's area activation for reading sentences than word lists (Fedorenko et al.,  ,  ,  , , ; Fedorenko and Kanwisher,  ; Blank et al.,  ), as well as with previous neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies of L1 ASL sentence comprehension (Neville et al.,  ; Newman et al.,  ,  ). The exact nature(s) of the role(s) of Broca's area in sentence comprehension remains highly debated, with prominent hypotheses suggesting syntactic-specific processes (Grodzinsky,  ; Grodzinsky and Santi,  ), verbal working memory (Just et al.,  ; Kaan and Swaab,  ; Rogalsky et al.,  ; Pettigrew and Hillis,  ), hierarchical structure building (Friederici,  ; Makuuchi et al.,  ), and cognitive control (Novick et al.,  ) as possible candidates. The present dataset may provide valuable insights into this debate: our ROI plots indicate that the portion of Broca's area engaged in English sentence comprehension (i.e., English sentences >English word lists) also shows preference for ASL sentences compared to word lists. In fact, the English sentence ROI in Broca's area is significantly more activated by ASL sentences than English sentences (Figure  ). This increased activation for ASL sentences compared to English sentences suggests that this region is not contributing via syntactic movement-specific resources (e.g., Grodzinsky and Santi,  ), coinciding with previous findings within spoken languages (Rogalsky et al.,  ), but rather this portion of Broca's area is more likely contributing to sentence processing as a cognitive resource, which likely would be taxed more due to increased processing demands to comprehend the less familiar L2 ASL sentences. ASL sentences also activated a cluster in the right hemisphere anatomical homolog of Broca's area, the right IFG, significantly more than English sentences. The right IFG is frequently implicated in L2 spoken language processing (Sebastian et al.,  ; Wei et al.,  ), and increased right IFG activation during language tasks more generally is thought to reflect an increase in cognitive demands and effortful processing (Prat and Just,  ; Prat et al.,  ; Gan et al.,  ; Mack et al.,  ). \n\nIn our exploratory analysis of neural correlates of L2 ASL proficiency, we found that greater activation in Broca's area is significantly correlated with greater ASL proficiency. At first glance, this finding may seem counter to previous findings that IFG involvement is associated with lower L2 proficiency (e.g., R\u00fcschemeyer et al.,  ,  ). We suspect that the previously-found scenario would be more likely in the present study if our sample included a greater range of ASL proficiency. However, our participants were all novice ASL learners who all first began to have substantial exposure to ASL in adulthood; it is possible that in our sample the participants who engaged in more effortful processing of the ASL stimuli also may engage more effortful processing during ASL instruction, thereby leading to relatively higher proficiency. This idea would align with Leonard et al.'s ( ) finding of greater left and right IFG activity for ASL words than written or spoken English words amongst the top achievers in the ASL classes they sampled from, and the finding of Williams et al. ( ) that greater activation during an ASL phoneme categorization task in Broca's area was seen after 45 h of ASL instruction compared to before any ASL instruction. While the present and previous findings of a greater response in Broca's area postively correlating with L2 proficiency could be due to intrinsic, individual differences that support greater L2 learning success, it is more likely that these findings reflect involvement of Broca's area in the learning of syntactic rules. This explanation coincides with findings in novel languages: IFG has been found to be activated during the successful learning of syntactic rules in artificial grammars (Opitz and Friederici,  ; Friederici et al.,  ). Bilingualism also does require a degree of cognitive control between the two languages (Kroll and Tokowicz,  ; Abutalebi,  ). Our relatively novice L2 ASL learners may require even greater control than a fluent bilingual, thus these Broca's area activations may reflect more effortful and less automatic processing of the second language (Friederici,  ). As a learner becomes more proficient (beyond the 1\u20132 years of coursework taken by our participants), the movement between ASL and English may become more automatic or fluid, and thus the need for cognitive control may decline (Emmorey et al.,  ). A longitudinal study would be needed to track this possible rise and fall of Broca's area involvement in L2 ASL sentence processing. \n\n\n### Anterior temporal lobe \n  \nOur analyses implicate the ATL more in the perception of both L2 ASL and L1 English sentences then their respective word list comparison conditions (Figures  ). These findings coincide with numerous previous functional neuroimaging studies of spoken languages in which greater ATL activation to reading and hearing sentences was seen in comparison to unstructured lists of words (Humphries et al.,  ; Vandenberghe et al.,  ; Rogalsky and Hickok,  ; Rogalsky et al.,  ). Lesion studies also implicate the left anterior temporal lobe in sentence comprehension (in addition to left posterior temporal cortex, discussed below) (Thothathiri et al.,  ; Magnusdottir et al.,  ; Pillay et al.,  ) . Previous studies of both deaf and hearing native ASL signers also have found the ATL to be sensitive to ASL sentence structure (Neville et al.,  ; cf. MacSweeney et al.,  ; Newman et al.,  ). \n\nEstablished sentence-processing regions of the ATL adapt to the new modality's sentence structures: the bilateral ATL ROIs defined by the contrast of English sentences\u2013English words both were found to have a main effect of structure, with sentences activating these regions more than word lists (not surprisingly, at least for English, given the defining contrast). It is notable though that in the right ATL ROI, there was no main effect for language, and in the left ATL ROI the main effect for language was not significant but trending toward a preference for English (  p   = 0.07; Figures  ). These findings suggest that L1 sentence-processing regions in the bilateral ATL do adapt to L2 ASL sentence structure, even in late L2 learners. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that the right ATL sentence ROI is more anterior than the left ATL sentence ROI, thus it is possible that the right ROI's response reflects language-related semantic processes in the temporal pole while the more posterior left ATL ROI's response reflects sensitivity to sentence-structure. Previous studies of both native sign and spoken languages do find ATL regions sensitive to semantic modulations (Petitto et al.,  ; MacSweeney et al.,  ; Chan et al.,  ; Mayberry et al.,  ; Visser and Lambon Ralph,  ; Leonard et al.,  ), and these semantic effects in the ATL also are evident in L1 and L2 of spoken language bilinguals (Leonard et al.,  ,  ). Regardless of the exact sentence-processing resource driving the right ATL's similar response to both L1 English and L2 ASL sentences, it is clear that L1 English sentence-processing resources in the ATL are adapting to the visual-spatial nature of ASL sentence structure. \n\n\n### Posterior superior temporal lobe \n  \nThe left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) is frequently implicated in sentence processing and is known to be sensitive in spoken languages to syntactic structure differences (Humphries et al.,  ; Thothathiri et al.,  ; Griffiths et al.,  ; Wilson et al.,  ) as well as semantic and prosody manipulations (Humphries et al.,  ,  ). Numerous other studies also implicate portions of the pSTG in syllable-level phonological, semantic, and auditory-motor integration processes (see Hickok and Poeppel,  ). Thus, it is evident from previous work in spoken languages that the pSTG is a functionally diverse region in regards to its contributions to speech processing. In the present study we found left pSTG regions to more activated by English sentences than word lists and by ASL sentences than word lists (ASL sentences also selectively engaged the right pSTG). The left pSTG ROI more activated by English sentences than words lists demonstrated a main effect for structure (both sentences >both word lists) as well as a main effect of language (English >ASL). Together these findings may reflect that a portion of the pSTG is engaged in sentence-level syntactic processing regardless of proficiency or modality, but with a preference for L1. It also is possible that our findings reflect subvocal rehearsal or translation of the ASL sentences to facilitate comprehension, thereby engaging the left pSTG, in which there are known to be subregions that are involved in phonological processing and verbal working memory (Buchsbaum et al.,  ). It also is possible that the preference for English over ASL in left pSTG may reflect a portion of this region being specific to spoken languages, in that it is most sensitive to phonological processing, coinciding with previous work implicating the pSTG more in orthographically transparent languages (i.e., more grapheme to phoneme conversions) than less transparent language (e.g., Italian vs. English; Paulesu et al.,  ). Future work is needed to explore these possibilities, but altogether our findings support the flexibility of the pSTG's sentence-processing regions to the visual-spatial syntactic structures learned during late L2 ASL, as well as likely the specificity of pSTG phonological processing regions to spoken language processing. \n\nIn our exploratory analysis of activations correlated with ASL proficiency, activation in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus to ASL sentences was associated with greater ASL proficiency. Recent neuroimaging studies of spoken L2 learning also implicate the pSTG in L2 proficiency. For example, Chai et al. ( ) resting-state fMRI study of native English-speaking adults learning French found that greater resting-state functional connectivity prior to L2 learning between the left posterior superior temporal gyrus and the anterior insula/frontal operculum (AI/FO, a region adjacent to Broca's area) was associated with eventual greater proficiency in L2 lexical retrieval. Kuhl et al. ( )'s diffusion tensor imaging study of Spanish-English bilinguals also implicates left superior temporal/inferior parietal regions; they found that higher density and lower diffusivity of white matter pathways underlying these areas were significantly correlated with more years of L2 experience. Thus, it is possible that the pSTG activations associated with increased L2 ASL proficiency reflect greater vocabulary or lexical knowledge. \n\n\n### Parietal lobe \n  \nPrevious studies of early bimodal bilinguals and deaf signers have both found parietal regions activated more by sign than spoken language (Newman et al.,  ; Emmorey et al.,  ; Pa et al.,  ). The authors of these studies have suggested that their parietal findings reflect a sign language-specific resource that may be due to modality-specific organization of sensory-motor integration cortex in parietal cortex (Pa et al.,  ). Our present findings coincide with this modality-specific organization of parietal cortex: we found bilateral superior parietal and left inferior parietal / post-central gyrus regions to be more activated by L2 ASL than L1 English sentences, as well as more inferior bilateral parietal regions that show the reverse pattern (L1 English > L2 ASL sentences). Our parietal lobe results suggest that the \u201cASL-specific\u201d parietal lobe involvement identified in previous studies of early bimodal bilinguals does not seem to be dependent upon age of acquisition. The increased response to ASL sentences than English sentences in the bilateral parietal lobes may be related to the increased spatial hand movements in the ASL sentences to convey grammatical information (subject, object, etc.) (Emmorey et al.,  ), compared to word lists that comparatively lack such movements. Our lack of finding of a right hemisphere parietal involvement for ASL coincides with Newman et al. ( ) findings that this neural correlate of ASL is related to an early age of acquisition. \n\n\n### Hemispheric laterality of ASL sentence processing \n  \nOne area of ongoing debate regarding the neurobiology of sign language is the right hemisphere's involvement in sign languages compared to spoken languages. There is evidence to suggest that the right hemisphere is more involved in sign languages than spoken languages, possibly because of the visual-spatial nature of sign languages, for which the right hemisphere is thought to be specialized (Bavelier et al.,  ; Newman et al.,  ; Emmorey et al.,  ). More bilateral activation has been reported during sign language comprehension and production than in spoken language (Emmorey et al.,  ). However, right hemisphere damage resulting in visual-spatial deficits does not necessarily impair sign language abilities of native deaf signers (Hickok et al.,  ). \n\nWe found that L1 English and L2 ASL sentences both activated large bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal networks, as seen in numerous previous studies of spoken language bilingualism, mostly independent of age of acquisition or proficiency (Perani and Abutalebi,  ; Ge et al.,  ) as well as in both spoken and signed languages in monolinguals (Hickok and Poeppel,  ,  ,  ; MacSweeney et al.,  ). We did not find any evidence of a right hemisphere preference for the L2 ASL vs. L1 sentences, conflicting with some previous studies of both spoken language bilingualism and bimodal bilingualism that have found greater right hemisphere involvement for L2 compared to L1, particularly with later age of acquisition and/or lower L2 proficiency (e.g., in novice L2 learners; Dehaene et al.,  ; Meschyan and Hernandez,  ) as in our participant sample. One possible reason for this discrepancy is task: our task was a passive viewing/reading task, whereas much of the previous work implicating ASL-specific right hemisphere involvement involved some type of active task (e.g., anomaly detection, sign/word repetition, recognition test) (Newman et al.,  ; Pa et al.,  ; Emmorey et al.,  ), which might lead to increased activation outside of the left-lateralized language network: greater effort during a variety of language tasks has been found to elicit greater right hemisphere recruitment (Just and Varma,  ). \n\nThere was only one right hemisphere activation cluster, in the right middle frontal gyrus adjacent to the right IFG, in which activation in response to ASL sentences was correlated with ASL proficiency. This finding may reflect additional recruitment of cognitive resources being associated with greater ASL proficiency in our cohort of novice ASL learners, as the right IFG and adjacent prefrontal regions are frequently implicated in increased task-related cognitive demands and greater effort during language tasks (Just and Varma,  ; Goghari and MacDonald,  ; Prat et al.,  ) and in L2 vs. L1 tasks (Wartenburger et al.,  ; Reiterer et al.,  ). Our mostly null results in the right hemisphere related to proficiency should be interpreted with caution as our study was likely underpowered for correlational analyses. But our null results also may be related to the nature of our ASL stimuli: in deaf signers, Newman et al. ( ) report greater right hemisphere involvement for ASL sentences with narrative cues (often involving head movements and facial expressions), which our ASL sentences mostly lacked. Another consideration is that stimulus-locked activation measurements may not best reflect right hemisphere contributions to ASL; functional connectivity analyses indicate that signers have greater functional connectivity between right temporal and inferior parietal regions than non-signers (Malaia et al.,  ), this may suggest more efficient involvement of the right hemisphere in signers' processing of ASL that may not be fully reflected in activation differences quantified in our subtraction analyses. It also is possible that in fact the right hemisphere is not engaged in ASL processing even as a function of proficiency because our cohort is still relatively novice learners; this would coincide with previous findings by Malaia et al. ( ) that the right hemisphere is not activated by ASL signs more than non-linguistic gestures in non-signers. \n\n\n### Future directions \n  \nOur ASL sentences contained two types of syntactic manipulations, inflectional morphology (as indicated by spatial relations) and word-order. Future studies are needed to determine if these two properties differentially affect L2 ASL proficiency and the brain regions recruited during ASL sentence comprehension in novice signers. Previous work in deaf native signers suggests that ASL inflectional morphology and word-order grammatical information are supported by two distinct but overlapping networks: Newman et al. ( ) found that in ASL inflectional morphology particularly engaged bilateral ATL, inferior frontal, and basal ganglia regions (i.e., regions known to be engaged in combinatorial processes and syntactic processing in spoken languages), while ASL sentences with critical word-order grammatical information activated regions often associated with working memory, including regions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (including the inferior frontal gyrus) and inferior parietal lobe. Differentiating between inflectional morphology vs. word order contributions may also provide insight into the contributions of the medial structures including the basal ganglia and hippocampus that in the present study were found to be more engaged by ASL than English stimuli. These subcortical structures' greater involvement in ASL than English may reflect increased memory retrieval, sequencing or combinatorial processes that L2 sentence comprehension requires (Newman et al.,  ; Leonard et al.,  ), and it is likely that the different grammatical properties recruit these resources differently. \n\nAnother potentially meaningful extension of the present study is to conduct a longitudinal study with a similar cohort. The present study collected data post-ASL instruction, thus, it is unknown how our subjects' brains differed prior to ASL exposure. Ample previous work indicates that it is unlikely that the activation patterns we found in response to ASL would exist prior to any ASL exposure, as the subjects would extract very little, if any, semantic or syntactic information from the perceived \u201cgestures\u201d and thus would not fully recruit language networks (Malaia et al.,  ; Leonard et al.,  ; Kovelman et al.,  ). However, there is emerging evidence from spoken L2 learning studies that the integrity of functional and structural brain networks prior to L2 learning are correlated with eventual L2 proficiency (Chai et al.,  ; Kuhl et al.,  ). Thus, a future longitudinal study, with a larger sample size to increase power of correlation analyses, and at least two pre- and post-L2 learning data points, is needed to better characterizes the neural signatures of L2 sentence comprehension and ASL proficiency. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe present fMRI study examined the functional neuroanatomy of ASL sentence comprehension in adult learners of ASL, particularly how L1 spoken language sentence comprehension networks respond to L2 ASL sentences. We replicate previous work in native signers as well as in spoken language late L2 learners, in that there is a high degree of overlap in the functional neuroanatomy of L1 and L2 sentence comprehension, despite L1 and L2 differences in modality and proficiency. Our results, with previous early bimodal and late spoken language bilingual work providing context, indicate that L1 spoken language sentence-processing regions can adapt to support syntactic structures in a different modality beyond the critical language periods in childhood. We find that within the L1 sentence processing network, Broca's area, the left anterior temporal lobe, and the left posterior superior temporal gyrus each respond differently to L2 ASL sentences. L1 sentence resources in Broca's area were significantly more responsive to L2 sentences, whereas left ATL regions exhibited no significant difference between L1 and L2 sentences, and posterior superior temporal regions exhibited greater preference for the L1 than L2 sentences. We suggest that the engagement of Broca's area to sentence processing may be related to increased cognitive demands associated with the L2 sentences, whereas the responses of L1 sentence regions in the ATL and pSTG to L2 sentences reflect L1 syntactic or combinatorial semantic processes being recruited for L2 sign comprehension. We also found that ASL sentence comprehension proficiency in late L2 learners may be correlated with increased activation in L1 sentence regions and decreased activation in visual-spatial regions in response to ASL sentences, but the nature and origin of these proficiency-related functional differences requires further study. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nLJ, YY, SM, MF, PH, and CR contributed to the design of the study.

A few recent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) studies indicate that the RS-fMRI could map off-line memory consolidation effects. However, the gene effects on memory consolidation process remain largely unknown. Here we collected two RS-fMRI sessions, one before and another after an episodic memory encoding task, from two groups of healthy young adults, one with apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b52/\u03b53 and the other with APOE \u03b53/\u03b54. The ratio of regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of local synchronization of spontaneous RS-fMRI signal, of the two sessions was used as an index of memory-consolidation. APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 group showed greater ReHo ratio within the medial temporal lobe (MTL). The ReHo ratio in MTL was significantly correlated with the recognition memory performance in the APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 group but not in \u03b52/\u03b53 group. Additionally, APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 group showed lower ReHo ratio in the occipital and parietal picture-encoding areas. Our results indicate that APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 group may have a different off-line memory consolidation process compared to \u03b52/\u03b53 group. These results may help generate future hypotheses that the off-line memory consolidation might be impaired in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nM\u00fcller and Pilzecker assumed that new memory takes time to be consolidated after encoding  . Many studies have shown that spontaneous brain activity after memory encoding is associated with memory consolidation. Single-unit recording animal study suggested that the spontaneous activity of the hippocampal place cells after learning is associated with memory consolidation  . With fairly good spatial and temporal resolution, RS-fMRI provides unique non-invasive technique to investigate the spontaneous activity of the human brain. Recent RS-fMRI studies have indicated an association of spontaneous brain activity with memory consolidation of recent scenarios  \u2013 . These results support the system consolidation theory, which hypothesized that the MTL (mainly hippocampus and parahippocampus) is required for initial storage and recall and that the neo-cortex is considered as the area where remote memory is stored  ,  . Recent memory consolidation studies also suggest that the MTL may play multiple roles in memory consolidation  . However, the changed relationship or functional connectivity between remote brain areas by these RS-fMRI studies did not reveal whether the local spontaneous activity in a specific area (e.g., MTL or neo-cortex) was modulated by a preceding task. Only two studies have measured the assciation between local activity and memory consolidation in human. One study used perfusion MRI and found that the regional cerebral blood flow increased in hippocampal and temporal lobe regions after a learning task and that the increases correlated with the performance of surprised recall task  . Another very recent study from our group found that the local synchronization of spontaneous fMRI signal in the MTL increased after an episodic memory task in a group of participants having better performance in a later surprise retrieval task, but not in a group having worse performance  . \n\nThe presence of APOE \u03b54 allele is related to increased risk of sporadic Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD)  ,  . Subtle episodic memory deficits are the earliest cognitive symptom of AD  . Structural MRI studies have reported significant atrophy of the MTL in AD patients  ,  . Functional MRI studies consistently showed abnormal MTL activation in patients with AD   and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI)  . Altered brain activations were also reported even in healthy carriers of APOE \u03b54 during memory encoding stage in the hippocampus  ,  . All these studies provided strong evidences that the MTL in AD or APOE \u03b54 carriers is associated with episodic memory deficit. Thus our first hypothesis was that the APOE \u03b54 healthy carriers probably have a different memory consolidation process in the MTL as compared with \u03b54 non-carriers. \n\nTwo previous RS-fMRI studies found memory consolidation-related changes in functional connectivity between brain areas associated with stimulus encoding. Albert et al.   showed that a resting state fronto-parietal network that is believed to be involved in visuomotor processing was modulated by motor learning, but not motor performance. Tambini et al.   showed that after a task with higher associative memory performance rather than poor memory performance, the magnitude of resting state functional connectivity between the hippocampal and lateral occipital complex was altered. The results from animal and human studies support the system consolidation theory, which hypothesized that the MTL is required for initial storage and recall and that the neo-cortex is considered as the area where remote memory is stored  ,  . Therefore, our second hypothesis was that the changes of local spontaneous activity related to off-line memory consolidation in the areas where picture encoding occurs might be different between APOE \u03b54 healthy carriers and non-carriers. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThere were two sub-studies. The whole study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University. The first sub-study was an APOE genotype screening study. 1220 students at Beijing Normal University were enrolled by advertisement when they were taking a freshmen entrance physical examination. After they gave a written informed consent, 4 ml extra blood was obtained when they were undergoing blood sampling during the physical examination. They were told that DNA genotyping results would not be sent to them. \n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood leukocytes using salting out method  . 917 of the 1220 samples were genotyped for the APOE allele type using PCR-RFLP  . Six APOE genotypes were identified: \u03b52/\u03b52 (N\u200a=\u200a1), \u03b52/\u03b53 (N\u200a=\u200a52), \u03b52/\u03b54 (N\u200a=\u200a13), \u03b53/\u03b53 (N\u200a=\u200a799), \u03b53/\u03b54 (N\u200a=\u200a51) and \u03b54/\u03b54 (N\u200a=\u200a1). \n\nIt has been reported that APOE \u03b52 may exert protective effects  . It is therefore expected that effects of the \u03b52/\u03b53 vs. \u03b53/\u03b54 may be larger than those of \u03b53/\u03b53 vs. \u03b53/\u03b54. About one year later, 40 healthy Han Chinese students (aged 18 - 23 years of age), 20 for \u03b52/\u03b53 group and 20 for \u03b53/\u03b54 group, were chosen from the above sample while the sex was matched between the two groups. The number of participants were kept similar from each college of Beijing Normal University. All participants were right-handed and without a family history of AD by self report. None of the participants had current or past history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. All participants gave written informed consent for MRI scanning and they did not know their genotypes. 35 participants completed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised for China (WAIS-RC). After the MRI scanning, they were all paid for their participation. One \u03b52/\u03b53 participant was excluded because of abnormal brain structure. \n\n\n### Scanning Procedure \n  \nMRI data was acquired on a SIEMENS TRIO 3.0 Tesla scanner in Beijing Normal University. There were five scanning sessions: \n  \nThe first RS-fMRI session (REST-1): 8 min (240 volumes). Participants were instructed to keep awake, close their eyes, and think of nothing in particular. Functional T2* blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) images were obtained using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with 33 contiguous axial slices (thickness/gap\u200a=\u200a3/0.6 mm, repetition time (TR)\u200a=\u200a2000 ms, echo time (TE)\u200a=\u200a30 ms, flip angle\u200a=\u200a90\u00b0, matrix\u200a=\u200a64\u00d764, and a field of view (FOV)\u200a=\u200a200\u00d7200 mm ). \n  \nMemory encoding task fMRI: 5 min (151 volumes). Participants were asked to press a button in their left or right hands by their index fingers to indicate that a picture was indoor or outdoor. Each picture appeared on center of the screen for 1500 ms. Participants were asked to make a decision in 2000 ms. The time between the end of a picture and the beginning of next picture was 500\u20136500 ms (average 3500 ms). In total 60 pictures (30 indoor and 30 outdoor) were presented in a pseudo-random order via E-prime software. To improve accuracy and the familiarity to the procedure, a short practice (10 different indoor/outdoor pictures) immediately before this task session was performed. Scanning parameters were the same as REST-1. \n  \nStructure MRI: approximately 10 min. We acquired T1-weighted sagittal three-dimensional images using magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (128 slices, TR\u200a=\u200a2530 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a3.39 ms, slice thickness \u200a=\u200a1.33 mm, flip angle\u200a=\u200a7\u00b0, inversion time\u200a=\u200a1100 ms, FOV\u200a=\u200a256\u00d7256 mm  and in-plane resolution\u200a=\u200a256\u00d7192). \n  \nThe second RS-fMRI session (REST-2): 8 min (240 volumes). Instructions and scanning parameters of this session were the same as REST-1. \n  \nMemory retrieval task fMRI: two runs, each lasting 5 min (151 volumes). Immediately before this task, the participants were told there would be a test task. The instructions were presented on the screen and read by the experimenter. When a picture was presented, the participants had to press the button in their right hands if they had ever seen the picture during the encoding stage; otherwise, they had to press the button in their left hands. In total 120 pictures, 60 old and 60 new, and 30 indoor and 30 outdoor were presented. The reaction time (RT) was recorded. The scanning parameters and picture presentation times were the same as REST-1. In this session, only behavior data was analyzed. \n  \nParticipants were not told that there would be a retrieval task until immediately before this retrieval task. Accordingly, the possibility of intentional memory performance was minimized during the two RS-fMRI sessions. \n\n\n### Pictures for Task Presentation \n  \nEncoding and retrieval sessions included totally 120 color pictures, half depicting indoor scenes and the other half depicting outdoor scenes. In order to make the error rate varies fairly large across participants (i.e., not too easy or hard to remember), we selected 120 pictures from a set of 180 pictures using a pilot behavioral experiment. Of these 180 pictures, 69 were neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS)   and the rest were obtained from the internet. \n\nAll these pictures could be easily classified into indoor or outdoor. All pictures were formatted in 640\u00d7480 pixels and were presented via E-prime software. We recruited an additional 12 college students to perform the pilot behavioral experiment. This pilot behavioral experiment had an encoding stage and a retrieval stage with a resting interval of approximately 20 minutes. The instructions and task presentation of the pilot experiment were the same as the fMRI task. The participants were not told it was a memory task before the retrieval stage. After the indoor or outdoor judgment task, they were just told to take a break to wait for another behavioral experiment. These participants were divided into 3 groups, each group (4 participants) encoding 60 images (30 indoor and 30 outdoor). The retrieval stage was the same as that of fMRI task, i.e., 60 old pictures and 60 new pictures. For each of the 180 old pictures, there were 4 participants. Therefore the hit number would be 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 for each picture. For pictures with a hit score of 0 or 4 (i.e., no or all participants could remember correctly), only a small part of these pictures was chosen as the fMRI task pictures. But for pictures with a hit score of 1, 2, or 3, large part of these pictures was chosen. Finally, 120 pictures were selected for the fMRI study. The above procedure for picture collection was the same one as in our previous paper published very recently  . \n\n\n### Behavior Data Analysis \n  \nD-prime is a statistic used in signal detection theory and calculated as: d-prime\u200a=\u200aZ (hit rate) - Z (false alarm rate)  . Z is the standard Z score (minus mean and then divided by the standard deviation). A higher d-prime means a larger difference between the hit rate and correct rejection, i.e., a better recognition memory performance here. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Preprocessing \n  \nThe first 10 time points were discarded to remove the initial transient effects and to allow participant get used to the scanner noise. Then RS-fMRI data were processed using SPM8 ( ) and DPARSF   ( ), including slice timing, realignment and normalization. All functional images were normalized into Montreal Neurology Institute (MNI) space in three stages. First, the functional images of each participant were co-registered with their own high-resolution structural T1 image. Second, the spatial normalization parameters of T1 image were estimated by segmentation. Lastly, the parameters were applied to the functional images. Then REsting-State fMRI data analysis Toolkit   was used for removing the linear trend and temporal filtering (0.01\u20130.08 Hz) of the time courses. \n\n\n### Region of Interest (ROI) Definition \n  \nROIs were defined by AAL template  . The medial temporal lobe (MTL) ROI includes bilateral hippocampus and parahippocampal region ( ). The encoding-related ROIs were defined by the activation map of encoding pictures (  p  <0.05, cluster size >270 mm ). \n   The medial temporal lobe (MTL) ROI.  \nThe MTL ROI from AAL, including the bilateral hippocampus and parahippocampal regions. \n  \n\n### RS-fMRI Data Analysis \n  \nWe used ReHo   to measure the local synchronization of spontaneous brain activities, which was estimated for each participant by computing Kendall\u2019s coefficient of concordance (KCC) of the time series of 27 nearest neighboring voxels. Compared with functional connectivity, ReHo requires no a priori definition of ROIs, and can provide local synchronization of spontaneous activity. ReHo has been used in AD and MCI researches  ,  , and ReHo has been found to be correlated with some behavior performance, such as stop signal reaction time  . REST software   was used to build individual ReHo maps. To quantify changes of the memory consolidation-related spontaneous brain activity, we used the ReHo ratio below: \n\nFor each participant, ReHo of REST-2 was divided by ReHo of REST-1 in a voxel-wise manner to get the map of ReHo ratio. And then ReHo ratio maps were smoothed using a 4 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. ReHo ratio between the two APOE groups were compared using the two-sample T-tests voxel by voxel in each ROI. AlphaSim, a program based on Monte Carlo simulation and implemented in AFNI ( ) was used for multiple comparison correction within each ROI (i.e., small volume correction, SVC). AlphaSim has been implemented in REST software  . The corrected   p  <0.05 corresponds to a combination of uncorrected   p  <0.05 and cluster size >567 mm  in the MTL ROI and a combination of   p  <0.05 and cluster size >1566 mm  in the encoding ROI. Finally, correlation analysis between ReHo ratio and recognition memory performance was performed in each group. \n\nTo remove potential effects of encoding activation on the memory consolidation-related activity in the MTL, we performed ANCOVA to regress out the task-evoked activation (mean beta estimate of each voxel). \n\n\n### Encoding fMRI Data Analysis \n  \nEncoding fMRI data pre-processing was similar to resting fMRI data, including slice timing, realignment, normalization and smoothing (4 mm FWHM). Individual statistical models were constructed in SPM8 for each participant using a general linear model (GLM). Statistical contrasts were constructed to compare picture encoding with zero. In the second level analysis, one-sample T-tests were applied to identify regions activated by GLM. The positive activation map (  p  <0.05, cluster size >270 mm ) obtained by the one-sample T-tests was taken as encoding-related ROIs for resting-state analysis. We also compared the activation between the two groups using two-sample T-test. Brain regions above combination threshold of   p  <0.05 and cluster size >2295 mm  were considered as significantly different between groups. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Results \n  \nThe demographic and behavioral data are listed in  . There were no significant differences in age, gender, IQ score and d-prime score (all   p  \u2019s >0.05). \n   Demographic data and behavior performance of two APOE groups.        \n\n### RS-fMRI Results in MTL \n  \nIn MTL ROI, two sample t-test showed that the ReHo ratio in APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 group was significantly larger than that in APOE \u03b52/\u03b53 group (  p  <0.05, two-tailed, small volume correction (SVC)) ( ). Paired t-tests revealed that the APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 group showed significant higher ReHo in REST-2 than in REST-1 in MTL ROI (  t  \u200a=\u200a3.789,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.001), but no significant ReHo difference was observed between REST-1 and REST-2 in the APOE \u03b52/\u03b53 group (  t  \u200a=\u200a0.569,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.576) ( , respectively). Furthermore, the ReHo ratio showed significantly positive correlation with d-prime, an index of recognition memory performance, obtained from the retrieval stage in APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 group (  p  <0.05, SVC), but the correlation was not significant in APOE \u03b52/\u03b53 group in this ROI ( ). It should be noted that this correlation analysis was performed within the cluster in which the voxels showed significant difference in ReHo ratio between the two groups. Using ANCOVA to regress out the task-evoked activation, the significant difference in ReHo ratio between the two groups remained (  p  <0.05, SVC). \n   Memory consolidation-related changes in the MTL.  \n(A): Significant higher ReHo ratio in APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 group than \u03b52/\u03b53 group.

Paired t-tests showed higher ReHo of REST-2 than that of REST-1 in the two groups in the occipital area (APOE \u03b52/\u03b53:   t  \u200a=\u200a6.928,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.001; APOE \u03b53/\u03b54:   t  \u200a=\u200a3.401,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.003) ( ) but in the parietal area, only in APOE \u03b52/\u03b53 group (  t  \u200a=\u200a5.134,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.001) ( ). Furthermore, in the occipital area, ReHo ratio showed a significantly negative correlation with the recognition memory performance (d-prime value) in APOE \u03b52/\u03b53 group (  p  <0.05, SVC), but showed no significant correlation in APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 group ( ). It should be noted that this correlation analysis was performed within the visual cortex in which the voxels showed significant difference in ReHo ratio between the two groups (upper part of  ). The above results may indicate that the encoding area is more involved in memory consolidation in APOE \u03b52/\u03b53 group during a relatively early stage of memory consolidation than done in APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 group. \n   Memory consolidation-related changes in the encoding-related brain areas.  \n(A): Significant higher ReHo ratio in APOE \u03b52/\u03b53 group than \u03b53/\u03b54 group in the occipital cortex bilaterally (upper) and left superior parietal lobule (lower).

The results of our study showed that APOE \u03b54 carriers may have a different episodic memory consolidation process, and this memory consolidation process is not affected by encoding effects. Our study of memory consolidation showed the gene effects on memory consolidation and provided a new sight in memory consolidation process in memory-related disease. This study also suggests that the RS-fMRI may serve as an effective approach for investigating spontaneous memory consolidation of the human brain. \n\nReHo is a measurement of local synchronization of BOLD signals. ReHo had been used in many brain disorder studies. In epilepsy studies, ReHo had detected the abnormally increase local synchronization within the epileptic focus, such as increased ReHo in MTL of temporal lobe epilepsy patients   and increased ReHo in the thalamus of generalized tonic-clonic seizures  . Based on these evidences, the increased ReHo after a memory task may suggest an increased local synchronization of neural activity related to off-line memory consolidation. \n\nAlthough APOE \u03b54 young healthy carriers showed significantly greater ReHo ratio than non-carriers in MTL, the two groups did not show significant differences in recognition memory performance (i.e., d-prime,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.73), being consistent with a previous study which did not find significant differences in memory performance between young (<50 years old) APOE \u03b54 healthy carriers and non-carriers  . The increased ReHo ratio of spontaneous activity in APOE \u03b54 healthy carriers may indicate a compensative off-line memory consolidation process, which may have resulted in similar recognition memory performance for the two groups during subsequent memory retrieval stage. The significantly positive correlation between ReHo ratio and recognition memory performance observed only in \u03b54 carriers also supports this interpretation. The decreased memory consolidation-related spontaneous activity may lead to worse memory performance in aged APOE \u03b54 carriers. \n\nThere is a possibility that the different consolidation effect after task was a direct consequence of different encoding activation of the preceding task between the two groups. Previous fMRI studies comparing the activation during encoding between successful encoding and failure encoding showed that the activation of encoding can predict the memory performance (subsequent memory effect)  ,  . Greater functional activation in MTL during encoding has been reported in young APOE \u03b54 healthy carriers than non-carriers  , and our results also showed greater encoding related activation in the right MTL in the APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 group than in APOE \u03b52/\u03b53 group. However, the significant difference in ReHo ratio between the two groups remained after the task-evoked activation was regressed out. This result suggests that the consolidation effect is largely independent of the encoding activation. The different activation during encoding does not account for the different memory consolidation in the MTL. Therefore, it is essential to focus on memory consolidation process. \n\nThe results in neo-cortex also showed that the local spontaneous activity in the areas where picture encoding occurs was modulated by the task. Albert et al. showed that a resting state fronto-parietal network that is believed to be involved in visuomotor processing was modulated by motor learning, but not by motor performance  . Tambini et al. showed that after a task with higher associative memory performance rather than poor memory performance, the magnitude of resting state functional connectivity between the hippocampal and lateral occipital complex was altered  . The results from animal and human studies support the system consolidation theory, which hypothesized that the MTL (mainly hippocampus and parahippocampus) is required for initial storage and recall and that the neo-cortex is considered as the area where remote memory is stored  \u2013 . The role of the visual cortex in memory consolidation remains unclear. In addition to visual perception and representation, studies have shown that the visual cortex is important for visual recognition memory and visual learning  . An RS-fMRI study showed that the changes in functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the visual cortex were involved in memory consolidation  . Our results provide evidence of association between the local spontaneous activity in the visual cortex and episodic memory consolidation. The difference in ReHo ratio between the two genotype groups in the visual cortex and hippocampus may suggest a different mechanism of memory consolidation for APOE \u03b54 carriers. \n\nSeveral limitations should be addressed. First, the off-line memory consolidation is a time dependent and dynamic process  . We only collected the data of 8\u201316 min after encoding. The dynamic course of off-line memory consolidation for a specific brain area needs to be further investigated. System consolidation suggests the transfer between the MTL and neo-cortex during consolidation. In our study, we just focused on the activity in the MTL and neo-cortex separately. Second, we did not collect neuropsychological data of episodic memory tests which are widely used in MCI and AD studies while we only performed correlation analysis between ReHo ratio and retrieval performance. Third, we did not include APOE \u03b53/\u03b53, the most common genotype in population, and therefore, the differences in ReHo between APOE \u03b52/\u03b53 and \u03b53/\u03b54 might not be attributed to the differences in ReHo between \u03b54 carriers and other genotype carriers. Finally, abnormal activation during memory encoding stage has been widely reported in aMCI and AD patients  ,  ,  . However, no imaging study has been carried out to investigate the spontaneous memory consolidation stage in aMCI or AD patients. The current results may shed new light on the mechanism of episodic memory deficit in AD. It would be interesting to determine if there is a vulnerable period of off-line memory consolidation for aMCI or early AD patients. If so, a cognitive therapy might be developed. \n\n### Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, we provide the first demonstration of memory consolidation process of different APOE carriers in the specific areas (such as MTL and encoding related areas) by using RS-fMRI. We found that both in MTL and encoding related neo-cortex showed memory consolidation related activity change after episodic memory encoding. And the mechanism of off-line episodic memory consolidation is different in APOE \u03b54 carriers. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone-0051617-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tSex (male:female)\tAge\tIQ full scale\td-prime\nAPOE \u03b52/\u03b53\t9\u223610\t20.5\u00b10.8\t126.79\u00b17.58\t2.47\u00b10.70\nAPOE \u03b53/\u03b54\t10\u223610\t20.8\u00b10.9\t126.53\u00b17.79???\t2.54\u00b10.62\n### Caption\nDemographic data and behavior performance of two APOE groups.\n### Footer\naOnly 15 participants tested IQ in APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 group.\n\n\n## ID: pone-0051617-t002\n### Label: Table 2\nDirection of response\tHemisphere\tSubregion\tBrodmann\u2019s area\tCluster size\tCoordinates of peak voxel\tt value of peak voxel\nAPOE \u03b53/\u03b54< APOE \u03b52/\u03b53\tR\tCuneus, lingual gyrus\tBA 18, 19, 30\t37071 mm3\t3, \u221284, 36\t\u22124.282\n\tL\tWhite matter\t\t1917 mm3\t\u221224, \u22126, 33\t\u22123.295\n\tL\tSuperior parietal lobule\tBA 7\t1782 mm3\t\u221230, \u221257, 33\t\u22123.080\n### Caption\nClusters with significantly different ReHo Ratio between the two APOE groups in Encoding-related ROI.\n### Footer\nNone\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 3520927, "text_md5": "717bbadca5a3d38f8499f0ac07ba3a69", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 168], "journal": [169, 177], "publication_year": [179, 183], "title": [194, 267], "keywords": [281, 281], "abstract": [294, 1625], "body": [1634, 27810], "tables": [27823, 28649]}, "batch": 4, "pmid": 23251595, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0051617", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3520927", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3520927"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3520927\">3520927</a>", "list_title": "PMC3520927  Effects of Apolipoprotein E Genotype on the Off-Line Memory Consolidation"}

Here we investigated the existence of multisensory predictive mechanisms in a context where actions have outcomes in different modalities. During fMRI data acquisition auditory, visual and auditory-visual stimuli were presented in active and passive conditions. In the active condition, a self-initiated button press elicited the stimuli with variable short delays (0-417ms) between action and outcome, and participants had to detect the presence of a delay for auditory or visual outcome (task modality). In the passive condition, stimuli appeared automatically, and participants had to detect the number of stimulus modalities (unimodal/bimodal). For action consequences compared to identical but unpredictable control stimuli we observed   suppression   of the blood oxygen level depended (BOLD) response in a broad network including bilateral auditory and visual cortices. This effect was independent of task modality or stimulus modality and strongest for trials where no delay was detected (undetected<detected). In bimodal vs. unimodal conditions we found activation differences in the left cerebellum for detected vs. undetected trials and an increased cerebellar-sensory cortex connectivity. Thus, action-related predictive mechanisms lead to BOLD suppression in multiple sensory brain regions. These findings support the hypothesis of multisensory predictive mechanisms, which are probably conducted in the left cerebellum. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPerceiving one`s own actions and related sensory action consequences is essential to successfully interact with the environment. One\u2019s own action consequences are highly predictable and therefore require less sensory resources than the processing of unpredictable external events. Predictive mechanisms allow us to anticipate the future state of both the environment and ourselves in order to compensate for delays in the transmission of neural signals and distinguish external events from the sensory consequences of our own actions [ ]. Predictions are found at different levels of processing, from simple eye movements to complex motor acts or language processing, and they have even been identified as one of the defining functions of the human brain [ ]. Efference copies [ ,  ] of motor outputs can be used to predict re-afferent sensory feedback (see [ ], for a review). They modulate the response properties of the corresponding sensory cortex and prepare it for re-afferent stimuli [ ]. This is known as the forward model (e.g., [ ,  ]) which presumably increases the efficiency of attention and cognitive processing by preventing the central nervous system from wasting neural resources on irrelevant sensory stimuli [ ]. This process also allows sensory re-afferents from motor outputs to be recognised as the self-generated result of an action. So far, \u2018predictive mechanisms\u2019 on a neural level have only been studied for single modalities such as responses to tactile [ \u2013 ], visual [ \u2013 ] or auditory stimuli [ ]. Since real-world actions usually stimulate several senses simultaneously (e.g., seeing, feeling and hearing my own hands clapping), the question arises whether and how we predict   multisensory   action outcomes. \n\nMultisensory processing mechanisms have often been related to facilitation in a variety of tasks [ ]. In these cases it has been assumed that events in a modulating modality (e.g., a sound) may render a particular space (and/or time) salient for another modality (e.g., a visual stimulus), to facilitate modality-specific processing for that time or place in the latter modality ([ \u2013 ]; see [ ], for a review). However, the challenge for the brain is to connect the different kind of information in a suitable way, especially because in an early stage different unisensory brain regions, e.g. auditory and visual cortices, are in charge of processing incoming information. The cerebellum is a good candidate brain region which might contribute to the prediction of multisensory action outcomes, since it is relevant for visual and auditory processing, timing, perceptual sequencing and predictive processing and is functional connected to visual and auditory sensory cortices (see [ ] for an overview). Despite the fact that first behavioral evidence suggests the existence of multisensory predictive mechanisms for auditory-visual action consequences [ ], the neural correlates of these processes remain unknown. Therefore, the current study focused on the neural processing of multisensory consequences of one\u2019s own action. \n\nThe principles of action prediction have been investigated with paradigms probing anticipated action effects. Behaviorally, it has been shown that self-generated stimuli are perceived as less intense compared to externally generated stimuli, a phenomenon known as sensory attenuation [ ]. Sensory attenuation has been demonstrated in the somatosensory [ ], auditory [ ] and visual domains ([ ,  ]; see [ ] for a review). These behavioral studies have been complemented by electrophysiological correlates of anticipated action effects (e.g., [ ,  \u2013 ]). Studies using fMRI suggest an involvement of the cerebellum in predicting action outcomes [ ,  ,  ,  ] and provide evidence for BOLD suppression for predictable compared to unpredictable (e.g., delayed) action outcomes in visual [ ,  ,  ], auditory [ ] and somatosensory [ \u2013 ,  \u2013 ] brain regions. However, up till now, sensory suppression at neural level has only been studied for individual modalities separately. Thus, whether actions with potential consequences in multiple modalities lead to BOLD suppression in multiple sensory processing areas in the brain is unknown. \n\nVarious tasks have been used to study predictive mechanisms and related sensory suppression at a neural level. These include looking at active action conditions in which the consequences are remapped to new spatial (e.g., real vs. rotated feedback of the hand [ ]), temporal (e.g., delayed feedback [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]) or unpredictable (e.g., passive movement or other control conditions [ \u2013 ]) outcomes. Delay detection tasks, in which a short interval between one\u2019s own action and the resulting perceptual consequences has to be detected, have several advantages for studying predictive mechanisms [ ,  ,  ,  ]: because they 1) focus participants\u2019 attention on the perceptual consequences of an action, 2) make it possible to compare subjectively instantaneous trials (in which reafferent feedback matches the prediction) with delayed trials (in which feedback is unpredictable), and 3) can be applied to action outcomes in multiple modalities. Up to now, delay detection tasks have only been applied to single modalities in imaging studies. However, on behavioral level we successfully applied the delay detection task to multiple modalities and found evidence for bimodal facilitation for the detection of delays [ ]. \n\nIn the current study, the neural correlates of predicting multisensory action consequences were investigated using fMRI, by adopting the basic design of the behavioural study [ ]. In an active condition, self-initiated hand movements (button presses) elicited the presentation of stimuli in the visual and auditory modality with variable short delays (0\u2013417 ms) between the action and its outcome. In a passive control condition, the same auditory, visual and auditory-visual stimuli were presented, unconnected to the participant\u2019s actions (participants did not move) and consequently unpredictable. In the active condition, participants had to detect delays between action and feedback. Thus, although technically there were more delayed trials than non-delayed trials, the participants\u2019 default temporal prediction was set to a delay of 0ms, by explicitly instructing participants to detect sensory information that deviated temporally from this action-based expectation. In the passive condition, participants only had to report whether they saw a unimodal or bimodal stimulus. Since real life actions (e.g., hand clapping or knocking on a door) usually have multisensory consequences we hypothesized that both multisensory and unisensory consequences would be predicted (see [ ]) and therefore the corresponding neural signals would be suppressed compared to when the same stimuli were unpredictable. Thus, compared to studies focussing on single modalities and related suppression in respective (uni-)sensory brain regions, we expected BOLD suppression in multiple sensory brain regions (e.g., auditory and visual cortices). Furthermore, we expected that BOLD suppression in auditory and visual sensory cortices would be independent of feedback modality, since visual, auditory and audio-visual consequences were equally predictable. Finally, we expected the strongest suppression effects to occur in trials that were perceived as simultaneous with the action, as for these trials the action consequences occurred as predicted/ in line with the default expectation (i.e. no violation of the temporal contiguity could be detected). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \n21 healthy, right-handed (Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ ]) participants with normal or corrected-to-normal vision took part in the experiment (8 males, age range 19\u201330, mean age 24.9 years). One participant had to be excluded from the fMRI analysis because of excessive movement, resulting in a sample of twenty participants (8 males, age range 19\u201330, mean age 25.1 years). For the subsequent analysis comparing detected vs. undetected delays, three further subjects had to be excluded because of their small number of trials per experimental run (see   fMRI data analysis  ), resulting in a final group of seventeen participants (7 males, age range 19\u201330, mean age 25 years) for the second analysis. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the medical faculty of the Philipps-University Marburg, Germany ( ; registration number: 123/13) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent has been obtained from all participants. \n\n\n### Stimuli and procedure \n  \nDuring fMRI data acquisition participants wore headphones (MR-Confon Optimel, Magdeburg, Germany) through which auditory stimuli were delivered in the form of a pure-tone 250Hz beep (presented for 1 second). The visual stimulus was a black dot (1.5\u00b0 visual angle), presented (for 1 second) centrally on a medium grey background on a computer screen (refresh rate 60 Hz) positioned behind the scanner. The screen was viewed by the participants in an appropriately angled mirror. Participants placed their right hand on a button pad, with their right index finger touching the button. The button pad was fixed on their right leg. The left index and middle finger were placed on two buttons of a separate button pad located and fixed on the left leg. Stimuli were presented using Octave and the Psychtoolbox [ ]. \n\nThe general paradigm ( ) has been adapted from a previous behavioral study [ ]. However, due to technical reasons an externally-controlled (passive) moving button could not be included in the current imaging study. The participants had to perform button presses with their right index finger, which would elicit the appearance of either the dot on the screen, or the tone, or both. The stimuli were presented either at the time of the button press, or with a variable delay. The participants\u2019 task was to detect the presence of a delay between their button press and the presented stimuli. They answered \u2018Yes, there was a delay\u2019 by pressing a button with their left middle finger, or \u2018No, there was no delay\u2019 by pressing a button with their left index finger. Participants always had to report the delays in only one modality, referred to as \u2018task modality\u2019 in this article. Thus, in bimodal trials participants only had to report whether they detected a delay between their action and the target stimulus, i.e. the stimulus in the other modality (referred to as \u2018task-irrelevant modality\u2019) was not important for the task. Participants were instructed at the start of each mini-block (12 trials) about the target stimuli (task modality) via written instruction (auditory task or visual task). There were 5 mini-blocks in each run (in total 60 trials per run). The task order was either visual\u2013auditory\u2013passive\u2013visual\u2013auditory, or auditory\u2013visual\u2013passive\u2013auditory\u2013visual. In active trials the delay between action and stimulus was one of the six predefined delays (0, 83, 167, 250, 333, or 417 ms, presented in frames (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25 frames)). In bimodal trials, the two components of the stimulus were always presented together. Unimodal and bimodal trials were randomized within each mini-block. \n   An example of a bimodal trial.  \nIn the active condition (top) participants had to wait with their button press until the cue appeared, and could take as much time as they wanted (max. 4 seconds). After a variable delay, unimodal or bimodal stimuli were presented. Participants had to report whether they detected a delay between their button press and the stimulus of the task modality. In the passive condition (bottom), an identical trial structure was used. However, no button press was performed by the participants and they had just to report whether they perceived one or two stimuli. \n  \nThe procedure during a trial was as follows (see  ). Each trial started with the presentation of a fixation cross presented for a variable intertrial interval (1, 1.5, or 2 seconds), after which a cue appeared in the form of the outline of a square (3.2\u00b0 visual angle), surrounding the fixation cross. \n\nIn the   active condition  , the cue indicated that from now on, participants could press the button with their right index finger, which triggered the unimodal or bimodal stimulus after a delay of 0-417ms. The participants were instructed to perform button presses at their own pace in a fixed time window up to four seconds after the cue onset. The visual stimulus appeared at the location of the fixation cross, thus obscuring it. For unimodal auditory trials the fixation cross remained visible during the presentation of the tone. The cue and stimuli disappeared at the same time. Subsequent to the offset of the stimuli and cue, there was a variable interval with the fixation cross before the question \u2018Delay? Yes/No\u2019 was presented on the screen, after a fixed period of six seconds after cue onset. \n\nIn the   passive condition  , participants were instructed not to press the button when they saw the cue, but to just observe and listen to the presented stimuli. In these trials, the stimuli were presented automatically after a variable delay (0.5\u20133.5 seconds) followed by a fixation cross. After a fixed period of six seconds after cue onset, participants had to judge whether one or two stimuli had been presented. They answered the question \u201cTwo stimuli? Yes/no\u201d with their left middle finger for \u201cYes, there were two stimuli\u201d, or left index finger for \u201cNo, there was only one stimulus\u201d. We introduced this bimodal detection task in order to have a similar trial structure and decision processes in the active and passive conditions. Furthermore, this task was easier than the delay detection task in the active condition. Therefore, it was unlikely that the expected suppression effects in active trials (passive>active) were confounded by an increased task demand in the passive condition. \n\nParticipants were instructed to be as accurate as possible, but were not required to be as fast as possible. They were given up to 2.5 seconds for their answer. Then the next trial started irrespective of the answer. Missing trials were not repeated to maintain a fixed data acquisition procedure for all experimental runs and participants. \n\nPrior to the fMRI experiment, participants were familiarized with the paradigm in a behavioural training outside the scanner. First, they could press the button several times to experience delayed (417 ms) and undelayed feedback. Then, to become familiar with the paradigm, they completed one run, with the same procedure and number of trials (60 trials) as the fMRI experiment in which they were given feedback about their performance (correct or incorrect). Then, they completed two more runs without feedback. Only subjects with a performance higher than 50% correct were invited to the fMRI study. All 21 of the original sample met this criterion. \n\nThe fMRI experiment comprised 300 trials in total: we presented 10 trials for each delay, thus leading to 60 unimodal visual trials (VU), 60 unimodal auditory trials (AU), 60 bimodal visual trials (VB) and 60 bimodal auditory trials (AB). Furthermore, unimodal and bimodal passive control conditions were presented: 20 trials visual unimodal (CV), 20 trials auditory unimodal (CA) and 20 trials bimodal (CB). Stimuli were presented in a rapid event-related fMRI design which was divided into five runs, each comprising 60 trials with 5 mini-blocks. \n\n\n### Analysis of the behavioral data \n  \nPercent delay responses per condition (VU, AU, VB, AB) were used to compare performance between conditions. Additionally, the average delay per condition (detected: VU-d, AU-d, VB-d, AB-d; undetected: VU-nd, AU-nd, VB-nd, AB-nd) were calculated and compared as pseudo-depended variable (see [ ] for a comparable approach). Finally, the button press latencies between conditions were compared and correlated with the respective performance per condition to explore potential relationships and to rule out potential confounds due to differences in button press latencies between conditions. \n\nRepeated-measures ANOVAs were performed using SPSS on the percent delay responses and average delays, which were calculated for each participant individually. In the analysis, unimodal trials were compared to all bimodal trials together. Posthoc t-tests (Bonferroni corrected) were conducted to verify the direction of the effects. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nMRI data were collected using a Siemens 3 Tesla MR Magnetom Trio Trim scanner. In order to minimize head motion artefacts, participants\u2019 heads were fixed using foam pads. \n\nFor each experimental run a total of 396 transversal functional images (echo-planar images, 64 x 64 matrix; 34 slices descending; field of view [FoV] = 230 mm; repetition time [TR] = 1650 ms; echo time [TE] = 30 ms; flip angle = 70\u00b0; slice thickness = 4.0 mm, gap size: 15%, and voxel resolution = 3 x 3 x 4.6 mm) that covered the whole brain (incl. cerebellum) and were positioned parallel to the intercommissural line (anterior commissure\u2013posterior commissure) were recorded. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nMagnetic resonance images were analyzed using standard routines of Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12;  ) implemented in MATLAB 7.9 (Mathworks, Sherborn, Massachusetts). For data preprocessing, standard realignment, coregistration between structural and functional scans, segmentation, normalisation (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] template 2 x 2 x 2 mm) and smoothing (8mm) functions of SPM12 were applied. \n\nFor single subject analyses, realignment parameters were included as regressors of no interest to account for movement artifacts. Low frequencies were removed using a high-pass filter with a cut-off period of 128 seconds. For the first set of analyses, the hemodynamic response triggered by each visual, auditory or bimodal stimulus of each condition (VU, AU, VB, AB, VC, AC, BC) was modeled with a canonical HRF. For the second set of analyses, active trials were additionally divided into those where delays were detected (VU-d, AU-d, VB-d, AB-d) and those where delays were not detected (VU-nd, AU-nd, VB-nd, AB-nd) leading to eight conditions. Additionally, button presses were included as single additional condition (not separated for modality) of no interest in the single subject models. Of note, the modulation of button presses had a significant effect on the result pattern, when comparing active vs. passive trials. Therefore, we provide additional information in the results section, when results are highly dependent on the modulation of button presses. Parameter estimates (b) and t-statistic images were calculated for each subject. \n\nAt the group level (second level analysis), we first performed a random effects group analysis by entering the parameter estimates for seven conditions (VU, AU, VB, AB, VC, AC, BC) into a flexible factorial analysis. In a second flexible factorial group analysis, contrast images of the active conditions separated for detected and undetected trials were entered (VU-d, AU-d, VB-d, AB-d, VU-nd, AU-nd, VB-nd, AB-nd). \n\nTo correct for errors of multiple comparisons, we employed family wise error correction (FWE) implemented in SPM12 at p < 0.05. To avoid type II error, we further explored results at p < 0.001 uncorrected, with a cluster extent of 50 contiguous resampled voxels. This threshold is more liberal than the FWE correction but still exceeds a cluster threshold calculated by monte-carlo simulations ( ; see [ ]), which suggested 47 activated continuous voxels at   p   < 0.001 uncorrected are sufficient to correct for multiple comparisons at cluster level (p < .05). \n\nThe reported voxel coordinates of activation peaks correspond to the MNI space (ICBM standard). For anatomical localization functional data were referenced to the AAL toolbox [ ] and the probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps [ ]. \n\nExploratory connectivity analyses in the form of psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, were conducted to better explain the condition specific association between activation change in auditory and visual cortices and the observed results in the cererebellum, motor cortex and SMA. \n\n#### Contrasts of interest \n  \nFollowing our hypotheses, contrasts of interest focused on sensory suppression as reflected in activation differences between active and control conditions (active action feedback < passive control conditions) as well as subjectively delayed vs. undelayed trials (detected > undetected). Interaction effects of task and feedback modality were calculated to explore specific effects for multisensory processing of action consequences. Finally, correlation analyses with behavioural data were performed to explore the relationship between BOLD suppression and behaviour. \n\nAnalyses were structured in two steps. First, all active action feedback conditions (VU, AU, VB, AB) were contrasted with respective control conditions (VC, AC and BC), to test for action-dependent BOLD suppression across conditions (VU<VC, AU<AC, VB<BC and AB<BC). Conjunction analyses (minimum t-statistics; [ ]) were applied to test for task- and modality-independent BOLD suppression (VU<VC \u2229 AU<AC \u2229 VB<BC \u2229 AB<BC). In a second step, trials where delays had been detected (VU-d, AU-d, VB-d, AB-d) were separated from trials where delays had not been detected (VU-nd, AU-nd, VB-nd, AB-nd) for each active condition. With this analysis we first tested specifically for BOLD suppression for undetected conditions (detected > undetected) in sensory brain regions (auditory/visual cortices) by applying an inclusive masking procedure using the result pattern of the first analyses (conjunction analysis; see  ), then we explored the general neural processes related to the detection of delays (detected>undetected) using whole brain analyses. Finally, interaction analyses were applied to test for effects of task (visual/auditory) and modality (unimodal/bimodal) on the neural processing of action consequences subjectively perceived as delayed compared to those perceived as undelayed conditions (detected/undetected). \n    Processing of action consequences compared to unpredictable control stimuli (conjunction analysis across conditions  : VU<VC \u2229 AU<AC \u2229 VB<BC \u2229 AB<BC).        \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \n depicts behavioral performance as percent delay responses (A, left) and averaged delay per condition (B, right) across all participants. A repeated-measures ANOVA performed on the percent delay responses using the factors modality (unimodal vs bimodal) and task (visual vs auditory) revealed a significant main effect of modality and of task (F(1,19) = 6.809, p = 0.017,   \u03b7   = 0.264 and F(1,19) = 9.541, p = 0.006,   \u03b7   = 0.334, respectively). The interaction between these factors was not significant (F(1,19) = 2.861, p = 0.107,   \u03b7   = 0.131). Analysis of the average delays per condition revealed significant main effects for detection (detected vs. undetected, F(1,19) = 1444.512, p < 0.001,   \u03b7   = 0.987), task (auditory vs. visual, F(1,19) = 7.300, p = 0.014,   \u03b7   = 0.278) and a trend for modality (unimodal vs. bimodal, F(1,19) = 4.274, p = 0.053,   \u03b7   = 0.184). Additionally we revealed significant modality*task (F(1,19) = 4.455, p = 0.048,   \u03b7   = 0.190) as well as detection*task interactions (F(1,19) = 4.597, p = 0.045,   \u03b7   = 0.195). However, the modality*detection and modality*task*detection interaction did not reach significance (F(1,19) = 0.201, p = 0.659,   \u03b7   = 0.010 and F(1,19) = 2.397, p = 0.138,   \u03b7   = 0.112, respectively). \n  \n Behavioural results as percent delay responses (A, left) and averaged delay per condition (B, right) across all participants.   In both tasks, bimodal trials showed more delay responses than unimodal trials. Furthermore, there was a trend for lower average delay for detected bimodal compared to detected unimodal trials, indicating that more trials with small delays had been detected in bimodal compared to unimodal conditions. \n  \nAnalysis of \u2018button press latencies\u2019 (time used to press the button) per condition revealed no significant main effects (unimodal vs. bimodal, F(1,19) = 0.542, p = 0.470,   \u03b7   = 0.028, and auditory vs. visual, F(1,19) = 3.903, p = 0.063,   \u03b7   = 0.170) or modality*task interaction (F(1,19) = 0.353, p = 0.559,   \u03b7   = 0.018). Furthermore, explorative correlation analyses revealed no significant correlation between the individual time used to press the button and performance in any condition. \n\nPerformance for the bimodal detection task during passive conditions was very high (PV: mean = 98.33%, SD = 4.36; PA: mean = 98.75%, SD = 3.05; PB: mean = 97.91%, SD = 3.70) and there were no significant differences between conditions (  p   > 0.494). \n\n\n### fMRI results: Processing of action consequences compared to unpredictable control stimuli \n  \nThe comparison of the responses to action consequences (active conditions) compared to the responses to unpredictable control stimuli (passive conditions) revealed for each condition (see  ; VU<VC; AU<AC; VB<BC; AB<BC) activation reduction in the active conditions in a widespread neural network, including bilateral posterior occipital cortices, bilateral temporal cortices and predominantly left motor cortical areas. Conjunction analyses across conditions (VU<VC \u2229 AU<AC \u2229 VB<BC \u2229 AB<BC) suggest that this suppression effect is quite independent of task or stimulus modality (see  ,  ). The inverse contrast (active>control) revealed activity in the right pre-/postcentral gyrus (MNI: x = 38, y = -22, z = 54; t = 9.72; cluster extension = 796 voxels), the left medial occipital lobe (MNI: x = -4, y = -86, z = -8; t = 7.91; cluster extension = 2742 voxels), lingual gyrus/precuneus (MNI: x = 12, y = -54, z = 2; t = 5.29; cluster extension = 36 voxels) and the left hippocampus (MNI: x = -26, y = -36, z = 10; t = 5.13; cluster extension = 8 voxels). \n   BOLD suppression for the processing of action consequences in contrast to unpredictable identical control stimuli.  \n(A).

Contrast estimates (extracted eigenvariates) of the activation clusters in the right auditory (dark gray) and visual (light gray) cortex, respectively. Each bar represents the amount of suppression as contrast between active auditory, visual or audio-visual consequences minus respective auditory, visual or audio-visual control conditions. (C). Suppression effects for each individual condition. VU: visual unimodal, AU: auditory unimodal, VB: visual bimodal, AB: auditory bimodal, VC: visual unimodal control, AC: auditory unimodal control, BC: bimodal control. P < .05, FWE corrected for multiple comparisons. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. \n  \nWhen button presses were not included as condition of no interest the contrast active>control revealed predominantly broad activation of the left motor cortex (MNI: x = -44, y = -18, z = 64; t = 10.45; cluster extension = 6336 voxels), reflecting the right hand finger movement. The general suppression effect (control>active) in the bilateral visual (MNI: x = 38, y = -54, z = -14; t = 5.21, p = 0.012 FWE, MNI: x = 46, y = -52, z = -12; t = 4.32, p = 0.258 FWE) and auditory cortices (MNI: x = 52, y = -50, z = 18; t = 4.69, p = 0.080 FWE; MNI: x = -64, y = -44, z = 10; t = 2.70, p = 0.004 uncorrected) was weaker, but still present. However, the predominantly left motor cortical suppression effect switched to the right hemisphere (MNI: x = 36, y = -16, z = 52; t = 5.46; cluster extension = 860 voxels). Thus, activation of the active/passive comparison, especially in the motor cortices, has to be interpreted with caution. \n\n#### Correlation of activation suppression and behavioral data \n  \nRegarding delay responses, we found for the VB condition a negative relationship between proportion of delay responses and activation in the left (r = -0.507, p = 0.023, two tailed, uncorrected) and right visual cortex (r = -0.534, p = 0.015, two tailed, uncorrected). For the VU condition only the negative relationship between proportion of delay responses and activation in the right visual cortex was significant (r = -0.467, p = 0.038, two tailed, uncorrected; see Table A in   for all results). This result indicates that lower neural activation (stronger suppression) is related to better performance (increased proportion of detected delays), speaking for a more efficient processing (at least in the visual task conditions). No significant positive correlations were observed. Thus, it is unlikely that activation reduction in active conditions reflects simply an interference with (or distraction due to) the additional button press task. \n\nCorresponding to the correlations with the proportion of delay responses, we found for the VB condition a positive relationship between the average delays for detected trial and activation in the left (r = 0.693, p < 0.001, two tailed, uncorrected) and right visual cortex (r = -0.689, p < 0.001, two tailed, uncorrected). For the VU condition the positive relationship between average delay and activation in the right visual cortex reached significance at a trend level (r = 0.385, p = 0.094, two tailed, uncorrected; see Table B in   for all results). This result indicates that lower neural activation (stronger suppression) is related to better performance (reduction of average delays), as shorter delays were detected. Interestingly activation in auditory cortices was positively correlated to average delays in the VB condition, too (left r = 0.487, p = 0.029; right r = 0.526, p = 0.017). No significant negative correlations were observed. \n\n\n\n### fMRI results: Processing of subjective delayed (delay detected) and undelayed (delay undetected) trials. \n  \nIn the second analysis, for each active condition, trials where delays had been detected (VU-d, AU-d, VB-d, AB-d) were separated from trials where delays had not been detected (VU-nd, AU-nd, VB-nd, AB-nd). With this analysis we first tested more specifically for BOLD suppression for undetected conditions (detected > undetected, masked) in primary sensory brain regions by applying an inclusive masking procedure using the result pattern of the first analyses (conjunction analyses; see  ) as mask. We found no effects by applying the conservative FWE correction for multiple comparisons. However, on the more liberal threshold (p < 0.001 uncorrected, 50 voxels) we found indeed BOLD suppression (detected>undetected) in bilateral occipital (MNI: x = -16, y = -96, z = -6; t = 4.76, cluster extension = 311 voxels, p < .012 FWE cluster correction; MNI: x = 24, y = -92, z = -14; t = 4.31; cluster extension = 99 voxels) and temporal (MNI: x = 60, y = -28, z = 8; t = 4.37; cluster extension = 81 voxels; MNI: x = -56, y = -32, z = 12; t = 3.88; cluster extension = 60 voxels) brain regions (see  ). These data are in line with the hypothesis that the better prediction for undelayed trials (e.g., due to the temporal contiguity) lead to greater activation reduction in auditory and visual cortices compared to more unpredictable delayed trials. Note, this analyses was less affected by the button press condition of no interest. We found also BOLD suppression (detected>undetected) in bilateral occipital (MNI: x = -16, y = -94, z = -6; t = 4.22; MNI: x = 26, y = -92, z = -12; t = 3.59) and temporal (MNI: x = 60, y = -28, z = 8; t = 3.65; MNI: x = -52, y = -32, z = 14; t = 3.08) brain regions when not controlling for the button press. \n  \n Suppression effects for subjectively undelayed (undetected delay) compared to delayed (detected delay) trials in visual (A, top) and auditory (B, bottom) cortices.   Data are inclusively masked by the suppression effect illustrated in  . The lack of effects in the visual cortex for auditory unimodal trials and in the auditory cortex for visual unimodal trials may be due to the fact that detected trials for these conditions led to high activation in brain regions related to the respective task modality only. Interestingly, in bimodal trials suppression was observed in both modalities. Bar graphs at the right illustrate suppression effects in visual (top) and auditory (bottom) cortices across conditions as a function of the delay between the action and the stimulus. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. P < 0.001 uncorrected with a cluster extend of 50 voxels. \n  \nFor general neural processes related to the detection of delays (detected > undetected; unmasked), we found effects in the left parahippocampus (MNI: x = -30, y = -34, z = -12; t = 5.58; cluster extension = 27 voxels), the right precuneus (MNI: x = 14, y = -60, z = 22; t = 5.53; cluster extension = 19 voxels) and the left putamen/insula (MNI: x = -28, y = -2, z = -2; t = 5.16; cluster extension = 7 voxels). At a more liberal threshold (p < 0.001, 50 voxels), we revealed a more distributed network comprising the medial prefrontal lobe and the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (ACC/PCC), the temporal poles, as well as parietal and hippocampal structures (see   and  ). The opposite contrast (undetected>detected) revealed two clusters of activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (MNI: x = 52, y = 20, z = 6; t = 4.42, p < 0.001 uncorrected; cluster extension = 149 voxels; MNI: x = 34, y = 26, z = -6; t = 3.93, p < 0.001 uncorrected; cluster extension = 73 voxels). \n   FMRI results for subjectively undelayed (undetected delay) compared to delayed (detected delay) trials (p < 0.001 uncorrected with a cluster extent of 50 voxels).  \nThe bar graph illustrates the contrast estimates of the left hippocampus cluster (at p < 0.05 FWE) and the bilateral ACC cluster (p < 0.001 uncorrected; for statistics see  ). \n     Processing of subjective delayed (delay detected) and undelayed (delay undetected) trials at a liberal threshold (  p   < .001 uncorrected, cluster extent: 50 voxels).        \nControl analyses comparing detected versus undetected trials matched for delay revealed a similar pattern of activation as illustrated in Figs   and   (detected>undetected; see Fig B in  ). Although only the 167ms delay could be included in this post-hoc control analysis, these results suggest that the previously reported results are not just due to the physical delay, but are also related to awareness of delay. \n\n#### fMRI results: Interaction effects \n  \nInteraction analyses were applied to explore the effect of task (visual/auditory) and modality (unimodal/bimodal) on the neural processing of trials subjectively perceived as delayed compared to undelayed (detected/undetected). We found no effects by applying the conservative FWE correction for multiple comparisons. However, at a more liberal threshold (p < 0.001 uncorrected, 50 voxels) we found a significant interaction effect for task (auditory/visual) by modality (unimodal/bimodal) in the left cerebellum (62.0% in left lobule VI (Hem.), 9.3% in lobule V (Hem.)) with cluster extensions to the fusiform gyrus (16.7% in area FG3, MNI: x = -32, y = -48, z = -26; F = 20.41, cluster extension = 182 voxels, p < 0.053 FWE cluster corrected; see  ). Contrast estimates of the respective cluster (extracted eigenvariates; bar graph on the left in  ) illustrate a specific activation for detected compared to undetected trials in the bimodal conditions (independent of task modality). This effect is mainly driven by significant differences between detected and undetected trials in the bimodal conditions (detected>undetected, MNI: x = -30, y = -34, z = -28; t = 5.82, cluster extension = 156 voxels, p < 0.001 FWE corrected) and no significant modulation in the unimodal conditions (p > 0.001 uncorrected). No other interaction effect revealed significant results at the chosen threshold (p < 0.001 uncorrected, 50 voxels). \n   The cerebellum: Interaction and PPI results.  \n(A) Activation of the left cerebellum with cluster extensions in the left fusiform gyrus for the interaction of delay detection (detected/undetected) and modality (unimodal/bimodal). Contrast estimates (extracted eigenvariates) of the respective cluster (bar graph on the left) illustrate a specific activation for detected compared to undetected trials in the bimodal conditions (independent of task modality). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. P < 0.001 uncorrected with a cluster extent of 50 voxels. (B) Connectivity results (PPI analyses) for the left cerebellum and seed regions in the right auditory ( ) and left visual cortex ( ). The bar graph illustrates the connectivity strength (arbitrary units, a.u.) of the cerebellum cluster (extracted eigenvariates from the PPI group analyses) and respective seed regions for unimodal (dark gray) and bimodal (light gray) conditions. Connectivity strength increased in bimodal conditions probably due to the additional task irrelevant stimulus. \n  \nTo further understand how the neural processing of auditory and visual action outcomes is related to the neural processing in the left cerebellum, we additionally conducted exploratory connectivity analyses in the form of psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses. Seed regions in the right auditory ( ) and left visual cortex ( ) were selected, as they demonstrated the most prominent suppression effect (highest t-values in the second analyses, see above) in the auditory and visual cortices (see  ). To test for specific effects of bimodal vs. unimodal conditions on connectivity strength between the seed regions and the left cerebellum, eigenvariates of the left cerebellum cluster (identified in the stimulus type*detected interaction; see  ) were extracted from respective PPI analyses and further analyzed using SPSS. A repeated-measures ANOVA performed on the extracted data using the factors modality (unimodal vs. bimodal) and audio/visual processing (visual vs. auditory cortex) revealed a significant main effect of modality (F(1,19) = 5.411, p = 0.031,   \u03b7   = 0.222), indicating increased connectivity in bimodal compared to unimodal conditions (see  ). The main effect audio/visual processing (F(1,19) = 1.677, p = 0.211,   \u03b7   = 0.081) and the interaction between these factors were not significant (F(1,19) = 0.259, p = 0.617,   \u03b7   = 0.013). Connectivity strength increased in bimodal conditions (see  ) probably due to the additional task-irrelevant stimulus. \n\nWhereas exploratory analyses for the left motor cortex (pre-/postcentral gyrus, PRG/PCG) and SMA (see  ,   cluster 1 and 6) revealed general positive connectivity to the seed regions in the auditory and visual cortices (for all conditions: one sample t-tests, p < .05 uncorrected), no significant main effects (PRG/PCG audio/visual processing: F(1,19) = 0.010, p = 0.922,   \u03b7   = 0.001; PRG/PCG unimodal/bimodal: F(1,19) = 1.542, p = 0.229,   \u03b7   = 0.075; SMA audio/visual processing: F(1,19) = 2.488, p = 0.131,   \u03b7   = 0.116; SMA unimodal/bimodal: F(1,19) = 0.346, p = 0.563,   \u03b7   = 0.018) or interactions were found regarding task or modality (PRG/PCG: F(1,19) = 0.859, p = 0.366,   \u03b7   = 0.043; SMA: F(1,19) = 0.078, p = 0.783,   \u03b7   = 0.004). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nPerforming an action and processing its consequences are usually tightly coupled, making those consequences more predictable than other external events. However, whether and how we predict multisensory action outcomes remains largely unknown. To shed light on this issue, we investigated the neural processing of multisensory consequences of one\u2019s own action using unimodal and bimodal visual and auditory stimuli presented at various delays after a button press, and identical, but action unrelated, unpredictable control stimuli. We observed BOLD suppression in a broad network including bilateral auditory, visual, and sensorimotor brain regions for action consequences compared to the responses to identical, but unpredictable, control stimuli. Suppression was independent of task or stimulus modality and was strongest for subjectively undelayed stimuli. An interaction of modality (unimodal vs. bimodal) by delay detection (detected vs. undetected) revealed activation in the left cerebellum with cluster extensions in the fusiform gyrus. Thus, the internal model and related cerebellar functions prepare the perceptual system for all possible action consequences and probably underlie the behavioral advantage for bimodal versus unimodal conditions. \n\n### Cross-modal action-related suppression \n  \nPrevious studies showing action-related suppression (or corresponding increase of activation for delayed feedback) in the auditory, visual, and somatosensory system have tested these modalities separately (e.g., [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]). On the other hand cross-modal audio-visual suppression effects have been reported, but independent of action [ ]. Our data extend these previous results in demonstrating action related BOLD suppression for more than one modality (in auditory and visual cortices) at the same time. In our paradigm, auditory and visual action consequences were equally likely. Consequently, visual and auditory information were equally predictable following a self-initiated button press. \n\nIt has been suggested that the efference copy plays an important role in predicting the sensory consequences of actions, such as various hand movements [ ,  \u2013 ]. Many studies have focused on the role of this forward model in predicting visual [ ,  \u2013 ], tactile [ ,  ], and auditory [ ,  ] consequences. We found BOLD suppression in both auditory and visual areas after either or both auditory and visual stimuli related to active movement, which suggests that the sensory system is prepared to process any sensory information consequent to a button press. Exploratory correlation analyses suggest that lower neural activation (stronger suppression) in visual cortices was related to better performance (higher detection rate and reduced average delay in detected trial) predominantly for the bimodal visual task condition, speaking for a more efficient processing. Individual differences in multisensory integration and especially the temporal aspects of multisensory binding received increasing attention in recent years, suggesting practical and clinical relevance [ ]. It has been shown, that variations in the temporal binding window (limited range of asynchronies tolerated for perceptual binding) are related to an individual\u2019s ability to integrate multisensory cues [ ]. Our data suggest a relationship between individual differences in temporal processing of action outcomes and BOLD suppression in sensory cortices. Thus, the association of action related predictive mechanisms and individual differences in temporal and multisensory processing remains an important topic for future studies. \n\nNo previous studies have directly tested the prediction of multisensory consequences of one\u2019s own action at the neural level. However, a previous behavioural study from our group found that bimodal action consequences led to an enhancement in the detection of delays between action and feedback, compared to unimodal action consequences, in particular when the task irrelevant stimulus was presented close to the action [ ]. This was interpreted as evidence that the forward model creates predictions for multiple modalities. Here we could replicate the behavioural finding (bimodal enhancement) and extend it to new evidence about the neural correlates. Another behavioural study showed that unpredicted visual stimuli affected loudness perception of auditory stimuli, both for self-generated stimuli and stimuli predicted by a cue [ ]. However, this study investigated the general cross-modal effect of predictability of task-irrelevant stimuli on the perception of the task stimuli without using fMRI methods. In our study, we were specifically interested in the perception of multisensory action consequences compared to unpredictable control stimuli. Few other behavioral studies have included multisensory action consequences to study the sense of agency. For example, Farrer and colleagues found that the presentation of a sound at the time of the button press significantly reduced the thresholds at which participants felt in full control of the appearance of the visual stimulus [ ]. Similarly, lower thresholds were found when additional tones were presented at the time of the button press and visual stimulus in a cross-modal grouping paradigm with variable delayed visual stimuli [ ]. In line with previous behavioural data [ ] our findings point towards the idea that one forward model creates multisensory predictions which consequently leads to bimodal facilitation on a behavioural level and activation reduction in both auditory and visual cortices. \n\n\n### The temporal window of suppression \n  \nTrials in which the participant perceived stimuli temporally aligned with their action (undetected) were accompanied by less neural responses in sensory brain areas as the stimuli that subjects perceived as presented with a delay after their button press. Thus, we observed more BOLD suppression in sensory brain areas when action consequences occurred close to action and were perceived as undelayed. As the task was to detect any delay in sensory feedback, this contrast reflects activity for detected violation of temporal contiguity between action and feedback. Framed differently, the violation of temporal prediction led to activation increase in brain regions relevant for the processing of auditory and visual information. By comparing detected and non-detected trials we could connect BOLD suppression more directly to action, since timing between action and its sensory consequence matters. Suppression was strongest in highly predictable trials in which the participants could detect no delay between action and feedback. That timing matters for sensory suppression could also be demonstrated for example by a MEG study, where N100m suppression in response to pure tones was especially pronounced immediately after articulary lip movements [ ]. This finding has been interpreted as suppression in the auditory cortex being caused by an efference copy from the speech-production system, generated during both own speech and lipreading [ ]. Increased BOLD activity when feedback was delayed and/or the delay was detected has been observed in visual [ ,  ,  ], auditory [ ], and tactile [ ] modalities. However, to our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate this effect for bimodal audio-visual conditions too. \n\n\n### The neural basis of cognitive factors \n  \nThe broad network in which we found differences between detected and non-detected trials included the bilateral hippocampus, the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices (ACC, PCC), parietal structures, and the temporal poles. It has been suggested that sensory attenuation is reflected in modulation of both sensory processing (e.g., for auditory or visual stimuli) and processing associated with a reduced engagement of cognitive control in response to an expected sensory event [ ]. This latter modulation could thus be seen as neural processing associated with predictability, such that it is attenuated for predicted stimuli but might also be increased for unexpected stimuli. Thus, frontal, parietal and hippocampal activations for detected compared to non-detected delay trials might reflect cognitive control processes. However, the observed activation pattern including midline structure activations (ACC/PCC) also corresponds to the so-called \u2018self-referential network\u2019 [ ,  ]. Thus, self-referential processing load might be especially high when consequences of our own actions deviate from our temporal prediction. Since our participants were explicitly told that they were always the agent, they would have attributed even delayed feedback as the audio/visual consequences of self-action but this would have been in conflict with the usual expectation of zero delay. ACC activation has been found to be involved in conflict monitoring [ ] and its activation here could therefore be a consequence of a prediction of error [ ]. Thus, activation for trials where delays were detected versus trials where delays were not detected could either reflect conflict monitoring, cognitive control processes in response to an unexpected sensory event, or a high self-referential processing load. \n\n\n### The role of the cerebellum \n  \nIn addition to the main effect \u2018delay detection\u2019 discussed above, we found a significant interaction of delay detection (detected/non-detected) and modality (unimodal/bimodal) in activation of the left cerebellum (VII) with cluster extensions in the left fusiform gyrus. Contrast estimates of the respective cluster (see bar graph  ) illustrate a specific activation for detected compared to non-detected trials in the bimodal conditions (independent of task modality), an effect that was absent in the unimodal condition. Notably the right cerebellum (VI and VIII) seems to be generally involved across conditions (see   and  ), however, the left cerebellum (VII) seems to be specifically involved in predicting multisensory consequences of one\u2019s own actions. The role of the cerebellum for action feedback prediction has been suggested [ ] and supported by a number of imaging studies focusing on visual [ ,  ] and tactile modalities [ ,  ,  ]. We extend these findings by demonstrating for the first time a specific effect in the left cerebellum related to the processing of multisensory information produced by one\u2019s own actions. The observed activation pattern in the cerebellum could also reflect a multisensory comparator mechanism as it compares expected and perceived auditory-visual signals (e.g., [ ]). It has been proposed that the cerebellum is an important component of the system that provides precise predictions of the sensory consequences of motor commands and acts as a comparator between intended and achieved movement, signalling errors in motor performance and neurophysiological data [ ,  ]. In contrast to previous investigations we provide evidence for a specific role of the left cerebellum in processing multisensory action outcomes. Moreover, this effect was not only absent in the unimodal conditions, but also independent of task modality; i.e. we revealed more activation for detected compared to non-detected delay trials in the cerebellum for both auditory and visual task conditions. Thus, the activation of the left cerebellum might be relevant for explaining the behavioural differences between unimodal and bimodal conditions. Behaviourally, we observed an advantage for bimodal trials, as shown by a significant increase in detection rates compared to unimodal conditions. These behavioural results are in line with our recent behavioural study [ ] and suggest that the forward model generates predictions for auditory AND visual modalities, leading to an advantage for delay detection in bimodal trials. This bimodal advantage might be due to a specific multisensory predictive function of the cerebellum. \n\nIn line with our data, cerebellar activity during tasks involving crossmodal matching had been reported [ ,  \u2013 ]. For example, it has been observed that combined audiovisual motion detection led to increased activity bilaterally in cerebellar lobule VI and right lateral crus I, relative to unimodal visual and auditory motion tasks [ ]. In an earlier study, subjects\u2019 ability to detect crossmodal temporal mismatch between simple stationary auditory and visual stimuli was assessed in two separate auditory\u2013visual (AV) and visual\u2013auditory (VA) conditions. Brain regions activated in common to both (AV and VA) conditions, included the left cerebellum [ ]. Together, these results suggest that the cerebellar hemispheres play a role in the detection of multisensory invariant temporal features in concurrent streams of audio-visual information [ ]. \n\nThe PPI analysis suggests that the connectivity between activity of the sensory cortex, which was relevant for the processing of the target stimulus, and the left cerebellum increased in bimodal compared to unimodal conditions. Thus, the task irrelevant stimulus strengthens the functional connectivity (FC). Previous studies focussing on the FC of the cerebellum used resting-state activity (see [ ] for an overview). These methods have contributed to distinguish two anatomic-functional parts of the cerebellum [ ]: a sensorimotor region (lobules V\u2013VI and VIII) and a multimodal cognitive and limbic region (lobule VIIA, especially crus I and II, with adjacent parts of lobule VI and VIIB, and lobule IX). In line with our result FC of the cerebellum to the visual [ \u2013 ] and auditory cortex [ ,  ] had been found. A hypothesis is that the cerebellum aids information processing by making predictions, in the form of an \u201cinternal model\u201d of sensory events [ ,  ]. Alternatively it has been proposed that the cerebellum facilitates perception by monitoring and coordinating the acquisition of sensory information (see the section by Bower, in [ ]). A third theory is that the cerebellum functions as an internal timing device for both motor and perceptual processes, with different areas of the cerebellum thought to provide separate timing computations for different tasks [ ]. Whereas the differentiation of these theoretical accounts is beyond the scope of the current study, our findings support the relevance of the cerebellum for visual and auditory processing, timing, and specifically the prediction and processing of multisensory action consequences. Whereas activity in the left motor cortex and SMA are also related to auditory and visual cortices, no bi-modality specific effects (as for the cerebellum) could be observed. Thus, the cerebellum generates predictions specifically for multisensory action outcomes, reflected in its increased connectivity to task relevant sensory cortices and neural suppression for subjectively delayed compared to undelayed trials. Ultimately this predictive mechanism might lead to better delay detection rates in bimodal conditions. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nDespite the new relevant findings and obvious advantages of our current approach it is important to mention some limitations. They include the relatively abstract stimulus material (button press, dot, and tone), and the fact that our design cannot distinguish between multisensory predictions due to efference copy mechanisms and multisensory predictions due to general temporal predictive mechanisms based on an intentional button press. A passive movement condition would be necessary to test more specifically for the role of efference copy. Such a condition is technically challenging to apply in an MRI environment; however, in a recent behavioral experiment, we did implement a passive movement condition which provides support for the involvement of efference copy in multisensory facilitation [ ]. Within our present fMRI design, an alternative explanation for activation reduction in the active compared to the control conditions could simply be that the button press distracts from the perceptual task. Thus, less neural resources are left to process the auditory and visual stimuli. However, the exploratory correlation analyses demonstrate no positive relationship between BOLD suppression and delay detection rate as well as no negative relationship between BOLD suppression and the average delay of detected trials. For the visual conditions, better performance was correlated with reduced activation in visual sensory cortices suggesting a more efficient processing and arguing strongly against the distraction hypothesis. Nevertheless, the relationship between performance and suppression remains a relevant future research topic. Furthermore, the control of general button press effects is challenging in the applied design, due to the differences in active (button press) and control conditions (no button press) as well as the high temporal correlation between button press and auditory and visual feedback. Consequently, the fMRI analyses considering the button press compared to those neglecting its influence led to changes in the result pattern, predominantly in -but not restricted to- the motor cortices. A better balanced experimental designs and the use of a passive movement device might help to reduce these effects in future. Future studies should also extend our findings to natural outcomes and less constrained actions. However, in a world in which we are surrounded by computers and other devices, it is a common action to press a button and expect a visual and/or auditory consequence, such as when typing a letter or playing a game. Thus, despite the setup being fairly abstract, it can still be considered ecologically valid (c.f., [ ]). Our study is an important first step in unravelling the neural processing of multisensory action consequences. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn summary, our results support the existence of multisensory predictive mechanisms in a context where actions can have outcomes in different modalities. We observed BOLD suppression in auditory and visual sensory processing areas for action consequences compared to identical but unpredictable auditory/visual control stimuli and for trials perceived as simultaneous compared to trials in which delays had been detected. Thus, the internal model prepares the perceptual system for all possible action consequences and underlies the behavioural advantage for bimodal versus unimodal conditions. Our results suggest that the left cerebellum is especially relevant for the processing of violations in temporal contiguity between actions and its multisensory consequences.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a prominent tool that helps in non-invasive examinations and is increasingly used to diagnose neuropsychiatric diseases.

All participants underwent individual and overall cognitive function tests and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). WMHs were divided into three groups (39 mild WMHs, 37 moderate WMHs, and 28 severe WMHs) according to their Fazekas scores, and the abnormal DC values in the WMHs and HCs groups were analyzed. \n\n Results:   There was a significant difference in the right inferior frontal orbital gyrus and left superior parietal gyrus between the WMHs and HCs groups. The functional connectivity between the right inferior frontal orbital gyrus and left inferior temporal gyrus, left superior parietal gyrus, and left parietal inferior gyrus was also different in the WMHs group. \n\n Conclusion:   The change in DC value may be one of the underlying mechanisms of cognitive impairment in individuals with WMHs, which provides us with a new approach to delaying cognitive impairment in WMHs. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a common cerebrovascular disease that refers to a syndrome of clinical and imaging findings ( ). The features seen on neuroimaging include white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), lacunar infarcts, recent small subcortical infarcts, perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and brain atrophy ( ); the most common neuroimaging feature is WMHs, which are often considered to primarily represent ischemic damage caused by CSVD ( ,  ). WMHs have been detected in 77.8% of healthy elderly individuals between 60 and 82 years of age ( ). These WMHs are among the most important vascular contributors to cognitive decline, dementia, and parkinsonism ( ). Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a common disease in elderly and has long been implicated with cognitive impairment, dementia, and stroke, causing up to 45% of dementia cases worldwide, and accounting for approximately one-quarter of all strokes ( ). A longitudinal study involved 818 individuals from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-2 dataset from August 2010 to May 2017 suggested that WMHs had a significant impact on cognitive impairment and elevate the risk of conversion to dementia. They even pointed that WMHs volume can be regarded as a non-invasive marker of cognitive degeneration ( ). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 36 prospective studies to explore the association between white matter hyperintensities and risks of cognitive impairment and dementia indicated that WMHs were associated with increased risk of cognitive dysfunction ( ). The previous studies found an association of progression of white matter hyperintensities with a faster decline of executive functions or processing speed ( \u2013 ). Another study indicated that WMHs volume were associated with an increased rate of decline in global cognition, perceptual speed, working memory, episodic memory, and semantic memory. Associations persisted after adjustment for total gray matter volume, vascular risk factors, and vascular diseases ( ). \n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an outstanding tool that helps with non-invasive examinations. Using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), researchers have found that the brain exhibits consistent low frequency fluctuations in the 0.01\u20130.08 Hz range, and that these frequencies could be used to indicated intrinsic activity within the whole brain ( ). rs-fMRI techniques have been increasingly utilized to investigate functional alterations related to WMHs. It has been reported that changes in the structural connectivity of brain networks have been found in WMHs, and abnormalities of the structural connectivity to central network nodes may lead to the occurrence of cognitive impairment related to WMHs to some extent ( ,  ). Therefore, a method to explore the disruption of functional connectivity in WMHs is needed. However, the magnetic resonance technology of previous studies tends to focus on the region of interest (ROI) ( \u2013 ). In previous study, thalamus was used as ROI to study the changes of functional connectivity (FC) of thalamic cortex in WMHs, and they found that abnormal thalamocortical FC was closely related with cognitive impairments in WMHs ( ). Similarly, some people pay their attention to the relationship between white matter hyperintensity in basal ganglia and cognitive function, they found that White Matter Hyperintensities Relate to Basal Ganglia Functional Connectivity and Memory Performance in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subcortical vascular MCI ( ). With the rapid development of neuroimaging techniques, an increasing number of imaging techniques are used in the diagnosis of neurological diseases. Degree centrality (DC) analysis is one technique that attracted our attention. Degree centrality is a particularly interesting graph metric of graph based network analysis methods ( ). It does not depend on prior assumptions as the choice of seed region or a predefined template to account for the brain regions. It is a robust index of focal connectivity ascertained by counting the number of direct connections from one node to all other nodes ( ,  ). Fair to good test-retest reliability of this technique has been proved in previous studies ( \u2013 ). Unlike seed-based approaches or independent component analysis, centrality measures take into account a given region's relationship with the entire functional connectome and not just its relation to individual regions or to separate larger components ( ). DC is the most direct measure of node centrality in network analysis. Generally speaking, a higher DC value indicates a more important node. Currently, DC has been used to evaluate changes in the brain network in diseases such as depression ( ), schizophrenia ( ), asthma ( ), and Parkinson's disease ( ). WMHs are mainly manifested as abnormal signals in white matter. Structural white matter connectivity is the basis of functional connectivity. We speculated that WMHs can affect white matter connectivity and further cause abnormal functional connectivity of cortex and subcortical nuclei. To investigate the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment, we used fMRI to analyze the DC value in patients with WMHs and HCs. In the present study, we analyzed differences in the DC value between patients with WMHs and HCs to further explore its possible mechanism. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe recruited 104 patients with WMHs (39 with mild WMHs, 37 with moderate WMHs, and 28 with severe WMHs) and 37 HCs. The clinical manifestations of WMHs are heterogeneous, and the clinical symptoms of WMHs do not exhibit a pattern; therefore, there are no established diagnostic criteria. Consequently, the diagnostic criteria mainly depend on imaging features. As a result, the inclusion criteria for the WMHs group were as follows: (1) age between 40 and 80 years and (2) visible WMHs on T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2 FLAIR). The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) intracranial and extracranial stenosis >50%; (2) Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment classification suggestive of cardiogenic stroke; (3) non-CSVD-related WMHs (e.g., multiple sclerosis); (4) mental disorders or alcohol addiction; (5) dementia or tumors; (6) intracranial hemorrhage; (7) significant hearing or visual impairment, physical movement disorders that prevented co-operation during cognitive testing, (8) language barrier, and (9) contraindications to MRI or known claustrophobia. Patients with WMHs were classified based on the Fazekas scores as mild group, moderate group, or severe group. Periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) and deep white matter hyperintensity (DWMH) were scored separately using a four-point scale according to the Fazekas scale on FLAIR images. The PVH scores were categorized as follows: 0, absent; 1, caps or pencil-thin lining around ventricles; 2: smooth halo around ventricles; 3: irregular PVH lesions extending into the deep white matter. DWMH scores were categorized as follows: 0, absence; 1, punctate foci; 2, beginning confluence of foci; and 3, large confluent areas. The Fazekas score is the sum of the PVH and DWMH scores. The mild WMHs group scored 1\u20132, the moderate WMHs group scored 3\u20134, and the severe WMHs group scored 5\u20136. Finally, we included 39 patients in the mild group, 37 patients in the moderate group, and 28 patients in the severe group. Thirty-seven HCs who were relatives of patients with WMHs and social recruits studied during the same period who matched the demographic data of the patients with WMHs, including age, sex, and years of education, and who had no previous history of neurological disease or mental illness were also included. Imaging revealed no WMHs. \n\nAll participants provided written informed consent to our protocol, which was approved by the medical ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. \n\n\n### Study Design and Process \n  \nThe screening and examination for WMHs was performed by trained neurologists and graduate students in neurology. We divided patients into three grades (mild, moderate, and severe) according to the Fazekas Scale, after which we collected the rs-fMRI and cognitive assessment data for WMHs, and finally completed the statistical analysis of relevant data. \n\n\n### Cognitive Examination \n  \nA cognitive examination was completed by all participants on the same day as the MRI scan, cognitive examination includes both overall and single cognitive tests. We used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to evaluate the overall cognitive function of participants and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), Trail Making Test (TMT-A and TMT-B), Boston Naming Test (BNT), and auditory verbal learning test (AVLT) were used to evaluate cognitive function, respectively. \n\n\n### MRI Data Acquisition \n  \nAll participants completed fMRI in the magnetic resonance chamber at the Information Science Center of the University of Science and Technology of China. During the scan, all participants were told to lie flat in the machine while resting with their eyes closed, but not to fall asleep, not to move their bodies, and not to think about anything. \n\nFunctional imaging was conducted using a 3.0-T MRI scanner (Discovery GE750w; GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK), each participant underwent MRI scanning, and the functional imaging was composed of 217 echo-planar imaging volumes. The specific parameters were as follows: Time of Repetition (TR) = 2,400 ms, Time of Echo (TE) = 30 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, matrix size = 64 \u00d7 64, field of view = 192 \u00d7 192 mm , slice thickness = 3 mm, no gap, and 46 continuous slices (voxel size = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm ). T1-weighted anatomic images with 188 slices were also acquired in the sagittal orientation (TR = 8.16 ms; TE = 3.18 ms; flip angle = 12\u00b0; field of view = 256 \u00d7 256 mm ; slice thickness = 1 mm; and voxel size = 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm ). \n\n\n### Data Pre-processing \n  \nFunctional data were preprocessed using the Data Processing Assistant of the Resting-State Functional MR Imaging toolkit (DPARSF) ( ) ( ) and a software package based on Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12,  ). All the data were processed with the following steps: (1) conversion of data format; (2) discarding of the first 10 volumes to exclude the influence of unstable longitudinal magnetization; (3) slice-timing correction; (4) motion correction; (5) normalization and registration to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template space; and (6) spatial smoothing based on the unified segmentation of structural images (Gaussian kernel, full width at half-maximum = 8 mm) and motion correction by scrubbing; (7) Filter (0.01\u20130.1 Hz). All participants showed a maximum displacement of <3 mm and an angular motion of <3\u00b0 and were thus included in the subsequent analyses. \n\n\n### DC Calculation \n  \nThe DC value is used to evaluate DC. Degree centrality represents the number of direct connections for a given voxel in the voxel-based graphs. In the present study, the preprocessed fMRI data were used to compute the voxel-based whole-brain correlation analysis ( ). The time course of each voxel in each brain was correlated to every other voxel time course in the gray matter (GM) mask. Thus, we could acquire an n \u00d7 n matrix of Pearson's correlation coefficients between any pair of voxels, where n is the voxel number of the GM mask. Next, we transformed the Pearson's correlation data into normally distributed Fisher Z-scores and constructed the whole-brain functional network by thresholding each correlation at   r   > 0.25 ( ). The threshold was the default setting while constructing the DC map. Only positive Pearson's correlation coefficients were considered in the present study. For a given voxel, the DC was calculated as the sum of the significant connections at the individual level. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nThe differences in age, years of education and cognitive tests were assessed with one-way ANOVA analysis, and sex distribution, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, drinking history, and smoking history between the HCs and WMHs groups were assessed with the chi-square test using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 23.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, United States). The Least\u2014Significant Difference was used for   post-hoc   analysis (significant for   P   < 0.05). We used DPARSF to extract the average DC and FC values of the brain region with significant difference, and then introduced it into SPSS23.0, and we used one-way ANOVA to analyzed the differences among groups. The statistical significance threshold for DC and FC was set to   P   < 0.001 at the voxel level and   P   < 0.05 at the cluster level with Gaussian random field (GRF) correction. Meanwhile, the Pearson's correlation analysis was conducted to find out the relationship between abnormal DC value in the related brain area and cognitive function, we only analyzed the correlation between the DC values of brain regions with differences among groups and the cognitive tests with differences among groups. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographics, Cognitive Examination, and Clinical Characteristics \n  \nThere were no significant differences in age, years of education, or sex distribution between the HCs and WMHs groups. The proportion of patients with hypertension was lower in the HCs groups than in the WMHs group, but there were no significant differences among the four groups in terms of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking history, and drinking history. Demographic information and WMHs marker information are shown in  .

Firstly, we used DC analysis to describe the intrinsic abnormal functional connectivity of the whole brain functional network at the voxel level in patients with WMHs, and we found that patients with WMHs exhibited significant differences in DC values in the right inferior frontal orbital gyrus and left superior parietal gyrus compared to those in HCs. Then, we do further FC analysis, the further results indicated that the functional connectivity between the right inferior frontal orbital gyrus and left inferior temporal gyrus, left superior parietal gyrus, and left parietal inferior gyrus differed in patients with WMHs. \n\nPrevious studies have suggested that the right inferior orbital frontal gyrus is the upper part of the limbic lobe, and evidence has indicated that it is associated with a variety of brain functions, including memory-related emotions, self-awareness ( ), cognitive regulation ( ), memory, and reward ( ). The right inferior frontal orbital gyrus is one of the core components of the default mode network (DMN) ( ). Resting state activity is defined as the default mode of brain activity to denote a state in which an individual is awake and alert, but not actively involved in an attention-demanding or goal-directed task ( ,  ). Since its discovery, interest has grown in the clinical utility and implications of the DMN ( ,  ), and the clinical significance of the DMN has been established or implicated in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders ( ,  ,  ). A previous study showed that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Parkinson's disease is related to the disrupted connectivity in networks involved in cognition, primarily in the DMN ( ). It was also reported that adolescent depression is associated with inflexibly elevated DMN connections ( ). A previous study showed that the longitudinal trajectory of default mode network connectivity is associated with changes in episodic memory and processing speed ( ). Furthermore, another study on children with temporal lobe epilepsy showed that there was a significant relationship between executive dysfunction and DMN ( ). In recent years, some studies have pointed out that abnormal structural network connectivity is related to cognitive impairment in patients with WMHs ( ,  ). Our results showed that the right orbital inferior frontal gyrus, an important part of DMN, whose DC value decreased, while the main cognitive impairment of WMHs are executive function and memory, which is consistent with previous studies. More recently, A meaningful study suggests that preferential destruction of cortical connections may lead to the progression of cognitive impairment in patients with WMHs ( ), highlighting the role of reduced structural connectivity in the cognitive impairment of patients with WMHs. Previous studies have found that the left inferior temporal gyrus plays a critical role in working memory; consequently, impairment of the left inferior temporal gyrus leads to a decline in memory ( ,  ), which is supported by the present study in some extent. We also found that the functional connectivity between the right inferior frontal orbital gyrus and left inferior temporal gyrus is significantly lower than that in the HCs group. Left inferior temporal gyrus, located on the lateral and inferior surface of the temporal neocortex, can be considered as a tertiary visual association cortex and the central portion of the language formulation area region, involving cognitive functions such as language, visual perception, and memory ( ). \n\nPrevious studies have shown that in elderly people, executive function is supported by the left superior parietal ( ,  ), and it has been suggested that the left superior parietal gyrus is engaged in basic attentional processing in executive function ( ,  ). These suggestions were supported by our findings that patients with WMHs with lower DC values for the left superior parietal gyrus had poorer executive function. In addition, a previous study told us that the left superior parietal gyrus participates in cognitive control and integration ( ). A decreased degree value indicates a decreased number of direct connections and reflects the decreased centrality or importance of a specific voxel in the brain network. In contrast to the right inferior frontal orbital gyrus, in the present study, we found that the DC value of the left superior parietal gyrus in the moderate WMHs group was significantly higher, which is consistent with a previous study, which suggested that the left superior parietal gyrus has a higher cortical thickness in patients with WMHs group than in HCs ( ). In a voxel-based morphometry study, researchers observed an increase in gray matter density near thinning regions, indicating there is a compensatory mechanism in relevant brain regions ( ). Furthermore, a regional increase in DC value might reflect an enhancement of function or compensatory hypertrophy in response to an acquired brain injury (i.e., WMHs). For example, changes in plasticity in individuals with an acquired brain injury most frequently leads to modifications in functional brain networks, which have been associated with distinct patterns of sensorimotor, behavioral, and cognitive impairments, are sparing ( ). However, it is interesting to find an increase of DC values in the left superior parietal gyrus. Our study also found functional connectivity between the left superior parietal gyrus and left parietal inferior gyrus in the moderate WMHs group. If a potential compensatory mechanism could be confirmed in these regions, it could be used to help prevent WMHs-related degeneration. In conclusion, we found abnormal DC values in a variety of brain regions in the WMHs groups, which might demonstrate the reorganization of the brain network in response to WMHs. \n\nIn the present study, we found a significant negative correlation between the DC value in the left superior parietal gyrus and MoCA score in HCs. This indicates that a higher DC value is not necessarily better; on the contrary, exceeding a threshold will lead to a decrease in brain function. Human brain network has the property of small world. Too high may indicate wrong connectivity or invalid connectivity. The appearance of invalid connectivity or wrong connectivity will lead to functional damage. In previous studies, we can find that the left superior parietal gyrus is closely related to cognitive function. Similarly, we also found a negative correlation between the DC value of the left superior parietal gyrus and the overall cognitive MoCA score in the HCs group, which further tells us that there is a correlation between the left superior parietal gyrus and cognitive function. WMHs are mainly manifested as abnormal signals in white matter, which often indicates that the structural connectivities of white matter are changed, and the structural connectivities of white matter are the basis of functional connectivities. We speculated that WMHs can affect white matter connectivity and further cause abnormal functional connectivity of cortex and subcortical nuclei. In the present study, our results suggested that the DC value of the left superior parietal gyrus in WMHs groups were significantly changed, meanwhile, their cognitive function was also significantly different from that in HCs group, however, the correlation between DC value of left superior parietal gyrus and cognitive function in HCs group was not found in WMHs groups, which is consistent with our hypothesis that the white matter connectivity of patients with WMHs is changed, leading to changes in their related functional connectivity, leading to changes in cognitive function. \n\nSince the clinical manifestations of WMHs are complex, we are unable to determine the mechanisms underlying these changes. Therefore, strict experimental design is crucial for future studies. \n\nThis study has a number of limitations. First, as a cross-sectional study, DC can only identify brain regions with abnormal functional connectivities and is unable to provide a clear causal relationship; we examined the functional connectivity based on defined ROIs. Second, the sample size was relatively small in the present study, which might have led to lower statistical power. Third, patients with WMHs were divided into three groups based on their Fazekas scores, which mainly emphasizes the average WMHs score but does not account for the actual brain areas with hyperintensities. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn the present study, we used the DC analysis to explore the abnormal connectivity pattern in whole-brain functional networks in WMHs. We also correlated DC changes with MoCA scores. The current results showed decreased connectivity in the right inferior frontal orbital gyrus and changed connectivity in the left superior parietal gyrus. The functional connectivity between the right inferior frontal orbital gyrus and left inferior temporal gyrus was decreased, and the functional connectivity between the left superior parietal gyrus and left parietal inferior gyrus had changed. All in all, these results provide us a new approach to probe into complex WMHs. Taken together, the abnormal changes of DC values in brain regions may help us to better explore the underlying mechanism of cognitive function changes in WMHs, and this rs-fMRI study advanced our understanding of WMHs. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets presented in this article are not readily available because The data that support the findings of this study are available on request the corresponding author.

Thus, this study aimed to investigate brain activation in response to visual sexual stimuli in patients with right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarction using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using fMRI in 20 participants (11 right MCA infarction patients and 9 age-matched healthy controls), we assessed brain activation elicited by visual sexual stimuli (erotic images) and visual nonsexual stimuli (landscape images). In right MCA infarction patients, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the left frontal subgyral area were more strongly activated by visual sexual stimuli than by nonvisual sexual stimuli. Brain areas that were more activated by visual sexual stimuli in right MCA infarction patients than in controls included the right parahippocampal gyrus and the bilateral frontal subgyral area. These fMRI results suggest that brain activation patterns in response to visual sexual stimuli might be influenced by right MCA infarction. Further research is needed to explore the association between sexual dysfunction and brain activation in poststroke patients. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nStroke is one of the major causes of disability and can lead to impaired psychological and physical function.  Following a stroke, patients often suffer from sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido, decreased coital frequency, erectile dysfunction, and sexual dissatisfaction.  Although sexual dysfunction causes poorer quality of life in poststroke patients, patients are often reluctant to discuss sexual dysfunction with physicians.  As a result, sexual dysfunction in poststroke patients is under-recognized. \n\nThere are numerous suggested causes of sexual dysfunction in poststroke patients, both psychological (such as depression, anxiety, or low self-esteem) and organic (such as stroke location, comorbidities, or medications).  However, the association between the location of the stroke and sexual dysfunction is still not well understood. Some studies have reported that sexual dysfunction is more common in poststroke patients with right hemispheric lesions than those with left hemispheric lesions,  while another study has reported the opposite result.  Furthermore, little is known about which brain regions are activated during sexual response in poststroke patients. \n\nSeveral neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) have been conducted to evaluate the activation of brain regions during sexual response in heterosexual males.  Of these 2 neuroimaging modalities, fMRI has been more widely performed due to advantages over PET such as higher temporal resolution and lower invasiveness.  Using fMRI, brain activation in response to sexual visual stimuli has been measured in heterosexual males, homosexual males, male-to-female transsexual individuals, and psychogenic erectile dysfunction patients.  In healthy heterosexual males, using fMRI, the activated brain regions in response to visual sexual stimuli included the parietal lobe, occipitotemporal area, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, amygdala, thalamus, and caudate nucleus.  However, literature on brain activation during sexual response in poststroke patients is scarce. \n\nThus, the aims of this study were to use fMRI to investigate \n  \nwhich brain regions are activated in response to visual sexual stimuli in male patients with chronic right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarction, and \n  \ndifferences in brain activation patterns during sexual response between chronic right MCA infarction patients and healthy controls. \n  \nIn this study, we recruited patients with chronic right MCA infarction because MCA territory infarction is a common cause of stroke, and some patients with infarction of the dominant hemisphere (usually left) suffer from aphasia which could lead to difficulty in an fMRI study. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThirteen male participants who had a history of right MCA territory infarction were recruited. The inclusion criteria were: \n  \nfirst-episode cerebral infarction, \n  \nelapsed time since onset of cerebral infarction \u22656\u200amonths, \n  \nsufficient cognitive and communication function to understand the study protocol, and \n  \nheterosexual male. \n  \nThe exclusion criteria were: \n  \npre-existing sexual dysfunction before cerebral infarction, \n  \nrecurrent cerebral infarction, \n  \ncerebral infarction in multiple arterial territories, \n  \ncognitive dysfunction (Mini-Mental Status Examination Score <23), \n  \nhemispatial neglect, \n  \npsychiatric problems such as mood disorders or substance abuse, \n  \nuse of medications that may affect sexual response including antidepressants, or \n  \nother coexisting neurological disorders that can influence sexual functions. \n  \nEleven healthy heterosexual male participants were recruited as age-matched controls. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our hospital. All participants provided written informed consents before participation. \n\n\n### Visual stimulation and image acquisition \n  \nTwo sets of photographs were used for visual stimulation: \n  \nerotic images, showing naked, sexually interacting couples of both sexes, and \n  \nnonsexually explicit images of landscapes with a similar hue and brightness to erotic images to be used as controls to assess the effect of nonsexual, nonspecific visual stimulation. \n  \nPhotographs from the International Affective Picture System were not used because their cultural or ethnic characteristics could influence the patients\u2019 perception of images as erotic. Thus, the erotic and landscape image sets each consisted of 10 photographs which were chosen by a group of psychiatrists, physiatrists, neurologists, and urologists specializing in sexuality and issues related to sexual function, who were not otherwise involved in the study. An fMRI blocked-design paradigm was employed in this study and consisted of rest and task blocks. During rest blocks, a gray screen was shown to the participant for 15\u200aseconds, and during task blocks, a landscape image or an erotic image set was shown to the participant for 30\u200aseconds. The time duration for each photograph was 3\u200aseconds. A total of 12 alternating rest and task blocks were presented followed by 15-second dummy scans. The order of blocks was rest, task (landscape image), rest, task (erotic image), repeated 3 times, and the order of photographs in each set was consistent throughout the experiment. Participants were asked to abstain from alcohol and caffeine 24\u200ahours before the functional image acquisition. \n\nHigh-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were obtained with a 3T MRI system (Achieva TX, Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands) using a 32-channel SENSE head coil. After anatomical scanning, whole-brain dynamic functional images (echo-planar imaging, gradient-recalled echo; repetition time (TR)\u200a=\u200a3000\u200ams, echo time (TE)\u200a=\u200a30\u200ams, flip angle\u200a=\u200a65\u00b0, field of view (FOV)\u200a=\u200a220\u200amm, 80\u200a\u00d7\u200a80 matrix, thirty 4.5\u200amm axial sections with no inter-slice gap) with a total of 120 volumes were acquired to measure blood oxygen level-dependent effects. \n\n\n### Data preprocessing and analysis \n  \nImage preprocessing involved slice timing correction, realignment, co-registration, normalization, and smoothing. Briefly, after the first 5 dummy scans were discarded to avoid nonequilibrium effects of the MR signal, the functional images were corrected for slice timing differences, followed by within-subject realignment to the mean image to correct motion artifacts with 6 rigid body spatial transformations. Each subject's anatomical T1 image was segmented to obtain a forward deformation map from the individual space to the Montreal Neurological Institute space template. The realigned functional images were spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute space template using the deformation map. To increase signal to noise ratio, the normalized images underwent smoothing with a Gaussian kernel with a width of 8 mm (full width at half-maximum). \n\nThe preprocessed individual data were analyzed using a fixed-effects model, convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. The 6 head movement parameters calculated from the realignment procedure were used as nuisance variables. Data were high-pass filtered with a 128 second cutoff period. The effects of the different visual stimuli (gray images, landscape images, and erotic images) on signal changes were evaluated at the voxel level using a general linear model. Contrast images from each subject were the \n  \nlandscape image versus erotic image, \n  \ngray image versus erotic image, and \n  \ngray image versus landscape image. \n  \nParticipants whose fMRI results did not show any difference between contrast images were excluded owing to the concern that participants did not concentrate on the visual stimuli. Group-level analyses were conducted using 1- and 2-sample   t-  tests to assess signal changes for each contrast in each group, and between the groups with age as a nuisance variable. A threshold of   P  \u200a<\u200a.001 with cluster-wise false discovery rate correction   P  \u200a<\u200a.05 was considered significant for the 1-sample   t  -test. A threshold of   P  \u200a<\u200a.001 (uncorrected) was considered significant for the 2-sample   t  -test with a cluster size >20 voxels. Data preprocessing and analyses were performed with Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM 12) software (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London, London, UK). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nOf 13 stroke patients and 11 healthy controls screened, 2 participants in each group were excluded resulting in a final sample of 11 stroke patients and 9 healthy controls. The mean age of patients was 56.21\u200a\u00b1\u200a8.9\u200ayears (range: 45\u201368\u200ayears) and that of controls was 53.7\u200a\u00b1\u200a9.3\u200ayears (range: 40\u201367\u200ayears). The mean elapsed time from onset of cerebral infarction was 48.0\u200a\u00b1\u200a33.4\u200amonths (range: 8\u2013105\u200amonths). All poststroke patients had left-sided motor weakness, and the mean score of the Korean Modified Barthel Index was 79.3 (range: 52\u201392). All patients and controls were right-handed. \n\nBrain regions activated by the erotic and landscape images in patients with right MCA infarct are shown in Table   and Figure  . Stronger brain activity during presentation of erotic images compared with landscape images was found in the left frontal subgyral area and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (  P  \u200a<\u200a.001, cluster-wise corrected false discovery rate   P  \u200a<\u200a.05). No areas of the brain showed reduced activity during either the landscape image or the erotic image compared to the rest condition, or the landscape image compared to the erotic image. \n  \nBrain regions activated in patients with right middle cerebral artery territory infarction. \n    \nBrain areas showing significantly increased activity in patients with right middle cerebral artery infarction.

Our results showed that the left frontal subgyral area and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were more activated by visual sexual stimuli than visual nonsexual stimuli in patients with right MCA infarction. The right parahippocampal gyrus and bilateral frontal subgyral areas were more strongly activated in response to visual sexual stimuli in patients with right MCA infarction than in healthy controls. \n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated a relationship between the right hemisphere and sexual function. In PET studies investigating brain activation during ejaculation by penile stimulation, increased regional cerebral blood flow was observed in the right posterior insula and adjacent secondary somatosensory cortex during sexual arousal, and in the right inferior frontal gyrus, temporal cortex, and precuneus during ejaculation.  Furthermore, it has been suggested that the right hemisphere is dominant in comprehending emotional stimuli and attention which is important for sexual arousal; therefore, poststroke patients with right parietal lesions may be prone to emotional disorders. \n\nSexual arousal originates from the interaction of 4 coordinated components: physiological, emotional, motivational, and cognitive mechanisms.  Thus, various brain regions are activated by visual sexual stimuli in healthy young heterosexual males, including cortical regions (including the frontal premotor, parietal, inferotemporal, lateral occipitotemporal, orbitofrontal, medial prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and insular cortices) and subcortical regions (including the thalamus, hypothalamus, caudate nucleus, claustrum, amygdala, and cerebellum). \n\nIn this study, increased brain activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left frontal subgyral area in right MCA infarction patients was observed during presentation of visual sexual stimuli compared with that of visual nonsexual stimuli. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is connected with the other regions of the prefrontal cortex and is critical for the integration of sensory information.  In a previous study using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was activated during and after exposure to visual sexual stimuli, whereas exposure to visual nonsexual stimuli did not produce activation in this region.  These findings suggest that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex might be associated with preserving the depiction of visual sexual stimuli in working memory and mediating the self-regulation of sexual arousal. Some brain regions, which have been shown to be activated by visual sexual stimuli in healthy heterosexual males, were not activated in this study. These findings might result from direct damage to those brain regions by MCA infarction or from damage to any part of the neural circuit regulating sexual arousal. \n\nInterestingly, the comparison of brain activation patterns in response to visual sexual stimuli between the groups showed that the right parahippocampal gyrus and bilateral frontal subgyral areas were more strongly activated in the right MCA infarction patients. The parahippocampal cortex has been shown to be more strongly activated by environmental scenes than other visual stimuli such as faces or objects,  and is associated with processing spatial contextual information.  Moreover, meaningless contextual shapes have been shown to activate the right parahippocampal cortex more strongly than the left parahippocampal cortex, while contextual objects predominantly stimulate the left parahippocampal cortex.  The pathophysiological mechanism of these fMRI findings is largely unknown. Further research is needed to explore associations between brain activation patterns during sexual arousal and sexual dysfunction in poststroke patients. \n\nA major strength of the current study is that it is the first investigation among poststroke patients of brain regions that are activated while viewing visual sexual stimuli. These results provide valuable information to further elucidate the mechanism of sexual dysfunction in poststroke patients. Nevertheless, several limitations of this study must be noted. First, the study sample size is small, and although we recruited patients with stroke in the same vascular territory, the sample was relatively heterogeneous in terms of age, infarcted area, and time elapsed since the stroke. Second, we did not assess sexual arousal toward visual sexual stimuli using self-report or penile enlargement measures. Third, the duration or type of visual sexual stimuli might be insufficient for sexual arousal in some participants. Fourth, patients with other cerebral territory infarctions, such as left MCA infarction, were not recruited. Thus, further studies with larger sample sizes, including patients with other cerebral artery territory infarctions, as well as investigations of sexual arousal, are needed. \n\nDespite the above limitations, this study is the first to demonstrate the impact of stroke on brain activation patterns during presentation of visual sexual stimuli. Using fMRI, this study revealed that the left frontal subgyral area and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were activated by visual sexual stimuli in right MCA infarction patients, and the right parahippocampal gyrus and bilateral frontal subgyral areas were more strongly activated by visual sexual stimuli in patients than in controls. These findings suggest that sexual arousal is affected by right MCA infarction. This study may help physicians to better understand sexual arousal in poststroke patients and provide clues about areas of further investigation. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \n Conceptualization:   Seong Ho Jang. \n\n Data curation:   Hyungpil Cho. \n\n Formal analysis:   Jae Hyeon Park, Eunkyung Kim. \n\n Funding acquisition:   Seong Ho Jang. \n\n Investigation:   Hyungpil Cho. \n\n Methodology:   Eunkyung Kim, Dong Woo Park, Joonho Choi. \n\n Project administration:   Seong Ho Jang. \n\n Resources:   Dong Woo Park, Seong Ho Jang. \n\n Software:   Eunkyung Kim. \n\n Supervision:   Dong Woo Park, Joonho Choi, Seung Hoon Han. \n\n Visualization:   Eunkyung Kim. \n\n Writing \u2013 original draft:   Jae Hyeon Park. \n\n Writing \u2013 review & editing:   Eunkyung Kim, Hyungpil Cho, Dong Woo Park, Joonho Choi, Seung Hoon Han, Seong Ho Jang. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tUnnamed: 1_level_0\tUnnamed: 2_level_0\tUnnamed: 3_level_0\tMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tUnnamed: 7_level_0\nContrast\tCluster P (FWE corr)\tCluster size\tPeak intensity (T)\tx\ty\tz\tRegion name\nLandscape image > Gray screen\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t0.0\t2195.0\t9.93\t\u22124\t\u221290\t\u22122\tCalcarine area left\n\t\t\t8.91\t\u22122\t\u221282\t\u22122\tLingual area left\n\t\t\t8.63\t\u221210\t\u221274\t\u221218\tCerebellum VI left\n\t\t\t8.52\t\u221218\t\u221292\t\u22122\tMiddle occipital area left\n\t\t\t7.04\t\u221214\t\u221284\t\u221216\tLingual area left\n\t\t\t7.01\t\u221218\t\u221290\t18\tMiddle occipital area left\n\t0.005\t147.0\t6.01\t16\t\u221274\t0\tLingual area right\n\t\t\t5.35\t22\t\u221268\t\u22126\tLingual area right\n\t0.009\t130.0\t5.67\t32\t\u221290\t6\tMiddle occipital area right\n\t\t\t4.93\t14\t\u221286\t16\tCalcarine area right\n\t\t\t4.92\t34\t\u221284\t\u22124\tInferior occipital area right\n\t\t\t4.72\t32\t\u221288\t14\tMiddle occipital area right\n\t\t\t4.61\t24\t-92\t12\tSuperior occipital area right\nErotic image > Gray screen\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t0.0\t401.0\t12.21\t\u221226\t14\t36\tVentrolateral prefrontal cortex left\n\t\t\t11.07\t\u221234\t18\t36\tVentrolateral prefrontal cortex left\n\t\t\t9.55\t\u221250\t0\t50\tPrecentral area left\n\t\t\t7.88\t\u221216\t20\t38\tFrontal subgyral left\n\t\t\t7.33\t\u221238\t10\t40\tPrecentral area/Middle frontal area left\n\t\t\t7.1\t\u221244\t4\t44\tPrecentral area left\n\t0.0\t878.0\t8.46\t\u221218\t\u221282\t\u221218\tCerebellum VI left\n\t\t\t8.0\t\u221238\t\u221258\t\u221212\tFusiform area left\n\t\t\t7.27\t\u22122\t\u221290\t\u22124\tCalcarine area left\n\t\t\t7.27\t\u221228\t\u221280\t\u221216\tCerebellum VI left\n\t\t\t7.26\t\u221220\t\u221290\t0\tMiddle occipital area left\n\t\t\t6.17\t\u221222\t\u221272\t\u22128\tLingual area left\nErotic image > Landscape image\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t0.013\t132.0\t8.67\t\u221224\t16\t34\tFrontal subgyral left\n\t\t\t6.99\t\u221234\t20\t36\tDorsolateral prefrontal cortex left\n\t\t\t6.77\t\u221230\t16\t42\tDorsolateral prefrontal cortex left\n\t\t\t6.11\t\u221240\t24\t42\tDorsolateral prefrontal cortex left\n\t\t\t4.78\t\u221238\t12\t42\tDorsolateral prefrontal cortex left\n### Caption\nBrain regions activated in patients with right middle cerebral artery territory infarction.\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: T2\n### Label: Table 2\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tUnnamed: 1_level_0\tUnnamed: 2_level_0\tMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tUnnamed: 6_level_0\nContrast\tCluster size\tPeak intensity (T)\tx\ty\tz\tRegion name\nPatients > Controls\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t69.0\t5.7\t\u221222\t18.0\t34\tFontal subgyral left\n\t32.0\t5.61\t18\t14.0\t42\tFontal subgyral right\n\t24.0\t5.14\t12\t0.0\t\u221222\tParahippocampal gyrus right\n### Caption\nDifferences in brain activation towards visual sexual stimuli between patients with right middle cerebral arterial territory infarct and controls.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying human responses to these new, artificial social partners remain unclear. The uncanny valley (UV) hypothesis predicts that humans prefer anthropomorphic agents but reject them if they become too humanlike\u2014the so-called UV reaction. Using fMRI, we investigated neural activity when subjects evaluated artificial agents and made decisions about them. Across two experimental tasks, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) encoded an explicit representation of subjects' UV reactions. Specifically, VMPFC signaled the subjective likability of artificial agents as a nonlinear function of humanlikeness, with selective low likability for highly humanlike agents. In exploratory across-subject analyses, these effects explained individual differences in psychophysical evaluations and preference choices. Functionally connected areas encoded critical inputs for these signals: the temporoparietal junction encoded a linear humanlikeness continuum, whereas nonlinear representations of humanlikeness in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and fusiform gyrus emphasized a human\u2013nonhuman distinction. Following principles of multisensory integration, multiplicative combination of these signals reconstructed VMPFC's valuation function. During decision making, separate signals in VMPFC and DMPFC encoded subjects' decision variable for choices involving humans or artificial agents, respectively. A distinct amygdala signal predicted rejection of artificial agents. Our data suggest that human reactions toward artificial agents are governed by a neural mechanism that generates a selective, nonlinear valuation in response to a specific feature combination (humanlikeness in nonhuman agents). Thus, a basic principle known from sensory coding\u2014neural feature selectivity from linear\u2013nonlinear transformation\u2014may also underlie human responses to artificial social partners. \n\n SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT   Would you trust a robot to make decisions for you? Autonomous artificial agents are increasingly entering our lives, but how the human brain responds to these new artificial social partners remains unclear. The uncanny valley (UV) hypothesis\u2014an influential psychological framework\u2014captures the observation that human responses to artificial agents are nonlinear: we like increasingly anthropomorphic artificial agents, but feel uncomfortable if they become too humanlike. Here we investigated neural activity when humans evaluated artificial agents and made personal decisions about them. Our findings suggest a novel neurobiological conceptualization of human responses toward artificial agents: the UV reaction\u2014a selective dislike of highly humanlike agents\u2014is based on nonlinear value-coding in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a key component of the brain's reward system. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nWould you trust a robot to make personal choices for you? Artificial agents capable of decision making are becoming more prevalent across human life domains ( ). Such artificial (i.e., synthetic, not naturally occurring) agents can elicit positive emotions but they can also make humans uncomfortable and even induce repulsion, leading to rejection as social partners ( ;  ). Understanding human responses to artificial agents is important, not only for optimizing human-robot interaction, but it may also reveal previously unrecognized mechanisms governing human\u2013human social interactions ( ;  ). \n\nThe influence of physical appearance on human acceptance of artificial agents is conceptualized by the uncanny valley (UV) hypothesis ( ;  ). This hypothesis states that robots become more likable the more humanlike they appear. But, when robots become too humanlike, likability decreases and instead reverses into negative reactions of dislike, eeriness or uncanniness. This nonlinear valuation is the so-called UV reaction. Although its psychological basis is not fully understood ( ;  ;  ;  ), the UV hypothesis offers a framework for investigating human\u2013robot interactions and associated neural mechanisms. \n\nFrom a neural coding perspective, human responses to artificial agents suggest a transition from a linear representation of humanlikeness to a nonlinear representation of likability (i.e., selectively decreased likability for highly humanlike agents). In sensory systems, such linear\u2013nonlinear transformations occur gradually as neurons acquire selectivity to specific feature combinations ( ). However, it is unexplored whether this coding principle also underlies responses to artificial agents. \n\nHere, we used fMRI to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying reactions toward artificial agents and their role in decision making. We hypothesized involvement of neural systems supporting mentalizing and social perception, including temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), as well as systems supporting valuation and decision making, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) ( ;  ;  ;  ). We examined these areas' contributions to UV reactions by measuring neural activity in two paradigms\u2014a psychophysical rating task and a choice task. We addressed the following questions. \n\nFirst, it is unclear whether a subjective UV reaction is itself neurally represented. Neural signals related to anthropomorphism of artificial agents have previously been described ( ); however, an explicit neural UV representation has remained elusive ( ). Evidence for a neural UV representation would support the UV hypothesis as a principle governing human\u2013robot interactions, with potential broader implications for human\u2013human interactions. \n\nSecond, the UV hypothesis implies the existence of: (1) a system that derives humanlikeness from sensory cues and (2) a downstream system that integrates these signals to a nonlinear value function, encoding low likability specifically for humanlike artificial agents. Analogous nonlinear responses to specific feature-combinations occur in multisensory integration ( ;  ). But whether a similar principle applies to social valuations\u2014including UV reactions\u2014is unknown. \n\nThird, as previous imaging studies focused largely on perception of robots ( ;  ;  ), the neural processes underlying decision making about artificial agents remain unclear. These processes likely converge in VMPFC and DMPFC, where mentalizing and decision networks intersect ( ;  ). Recent studies showed that activity in these areas differs during social choices ( ;  ) and evaluations ( ;  ). Despite these advances, delineating functional distinctions between VMPFC and DMPFC remains difficult and approaches involving artificial agents, as taken here in the context of the UV hypothesis, may offer new insights. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### \n  \n#### \n  \n##### Participants. \n  \nTwenty-six healthy volunteers (14 female, 12 male; aged between 18 and 35 years, M = 23.04, SD = 4.47) participated in this study, though the final sample consisted of 21 subjects (see below). The local ethical committee approved the study. Participants were recruited via general advertising on campus. Inclusion criterion was that participants had to be aged between 18 and 35 years. Exclusion criteria were the usual exclusion criteria due to technical and medical limitations (no implants; no large tattoos in the region of head, neck, shoulder and upper back; no claustrophobia; no current medication). None of the 26 participants suffered from neurological or psychiatric diseases as ensured by previous E-mail-based screening. Twenty-four participants were right-handed and two left-handed. Four data sets were excluded due to data loss or technical problems during scanning. Most of participants were students (  n   = 23) who received extra credit (hourly credit as a trial subject). Nonstudent participants (  n   = 3) were reimbursed with \u20ac40. Upon arrival participants were instructed and signed informed consent. Before starting the scanning procedure, participants trained how to operate the response device used in the scanner. They completed a series of rating tasks and a series of choice tasks. These rating and choice tasks involved different pictures as subsequently used in the scanner. Subsequently, participants were prepared for the scanner and then completed the six experimental sessions in the scanner. After the fMRI session, participants completed a questionnaire after which they were debriefed, reimbursed and thanked for their participation. \n\n\n##### Design. \n  \nParticipants underwent six experimental sessions of fMRI scanning of the main task and two additional shorter sessions for functional localizers (not analyzed for the present study). In each experimental session, participants were asked to perform rating and choice tasks, which were run in random permutation trial-by-trial. In total, participants performed 72 trials of the rating task and 108 trials of the choice task. \n\n\n##### Stimuli. \n  \nThe experiment used six stimulus categories: humans without physical impairments, humans with physical impairments, artificial (synthetic) humans, android robots, humanoid robots and mechanoid robots. \n\nPictures of humans with and without physical impairments were taken from picture databases ( ;  ,  ,  ). Only pictures showing people in a standing (if possible for humans with physical impairments), frontal position without exaggerated postures or exaggerated facial expressions in front of a white background were considered for the pretest. Pictures with extreme colors (e.g., bright red) were excluded. \n\nPictures of artificial humans were created based on portraits of people who received extreme plastic surgery ( ). The pictures present the people in dramatic light and reduced coloring (resulting in a light-gray complexion). According to the orientation of the heads depicted in the Toledano portraits, pictures were taken of volunteers exposing the same head and body orientation, under similar light conditions. The pictures of the bodies were also reduced in coloring and matched to the portraits, resulting in full body images of humans who share some irritating features: reduced coloring which resulted in light-gray complexion, mismatches in the proportion of head and body, exaggerated facial features (due to plastic surgery). In total, nine synthetic humans (four female, five male) were evaluated. \n\nFor the category of the android robots, the pretest included a set of 10 android robots. Again, pictures showed the robots in a standing or sitting frontal position without exaggerated postures or exaggerated facial expressions. \n\nFor the humanoid and mechanoid robots, pictures were chosen from a study on robot appearances ( ). In total, 10 mechanoid and eight humanoid robots were evaluated. \n\nIn the pretest, the humans and robots were evaluated with regard to eight items (likable, unpleasant, familiar, uncanny, intelligent, disgusting, humanlike, and attractive) rated on a six-point Likert scale ranging from \u201cI fully agree\u201d to \u201cI do not agree at all\u201d. To keep the test short, two sets of pictures were created which were evaluated by 77 participants (39 participants completed set one, and 38 completed set two). Mean values for each of the eight items and each of the stimulus pictures were calculated. With regard to the humans without physical impairments, those pictures of female and male healthy humans were selected that provided the best fit of high likability, humanlikeness, and attractiveness and rated low in terms of being uncanny, unpleasant and disgusting. \n\nThe resulting stimulus material consists of six pictures for each of the six categories. When necessary, and if possible, gender of the stimuli was balanced. However, due to the restricted original material it was not possible to balance for gender within the category of humans with impairments and synthetic humans. Both groups contained more pictures with male than with female people. \n\nThus, we wished to study evaluations for specific categories of stimuli that feature in the literature of the UV and that are distinguished from each other by their design features. These categories included: (1) the very un-humanlike mechanoid robots, which are typically not designed with the intention to mimic human appearance, (2) humanoid robots, which resemble humans in terms of basic body shape but without clear recognizable facial features, (3) android robots, which are explicitly designed to closely mimic human appearance including in facial features, (4) the newly introduced artificial humans, which were derived from real human faces (see our explanation above), and (5,6) humans with or without physical disabilities, which were recognizably human but varied in familiarity. Each of these categories was represented by several stimulus exemplars that were carefully selected based on pretests: In an online study ( ), >40 robots were evaluated regarding UV measures. A cluster analysis showed that robots with similar patterns of received evaluations (e.g., on humanlikeness and likability) clustered also regarding design characteristics. Thus, our fMRI study was intended to study specific classes of stimuli based on theoretical and empirical considerations. This approach also closely follows the UV literature in which the UV effect is fit to mean data for stimulus categories ( ). \n\nVisual stimulus presentation was controlled using the software PRESENTATION (Neurobehavioral Systems). \n\n\n##### Rating task. \n  \nThe rating trials started with the presentation of a stimulus for 4 s, followed by a blank screen for 3 s. Afterward, participants rated the stimulus with regard to its likability, familiarity and humanlikeness on three separate visual analog scales, each presented for 3 s. The scales ranged from 1 (not at all likable/familiar/humanlike) to 5 (very likable/familiar/humanlike). The rating scales were followed by a variable intertrial interval (ITI) with jittered duration of 2\u20136 s. An instruction was presented during the ITI (\u201crate\u201d or \u201cdecide\u201d) to inform participants about whether the next trial would be a rating or choice trial. Each specific picture (i.e., stimulus) was presented twice, resulting in 72 rating trials in total (6 stimulus categories \u00d7 6 pictures \u00d7 2 repetitions). \n\n\n##### Choice task. \n  \nThe choice trials started with the presentation of the first stimulus for 4 s, followed by a blank screen of 3 s. Then the second stimulus was shown for 4 s, followed by a blank screen of 4 s. Subjects were then prompted to report their choice by showing the options \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201csecond\u201d on the monitor (within 2 s). Subsequently, participants rated their confidence level with regard to the previously reported decision on a separate visual analog scale presented for 3 s. The scale ranged from 1 (not at all confident) to 5 (very confident). \n\nSubjects were instructed that they have to choose between two pictures against the background of the following scenario: \u201cBefore this study we asked all humans and robots to choose one item among four items which will be given to the volunteers as gratification for participation in this study. The four items were a movie theater voucher, a package of dishwasher tabs, a bottle of sparkling wine, and a package of quality toilet bowl deodorizer blocks. Every person and robot made a choice. You will see pictures of all these persons and robots, but will not receive information on who decided in favor for what item. During the choice task trial you will see two pictures each showing a person or a robot (in the possible combinations person-person, robot-person, and robot-robot). You shall decide in favor of the picture showing the robot or the person from whom you prefer to receive the previously chosen present. Since the time for decision making and reporting your decision is very short, please make a \u201cgut decision\u201d. There will be easy and hard decisions. Thus, please indicate your level of confidence in the decision on a subsequent rating scale from 1 (not at all confident) to 5 (very confident).\u201d \n\nAll subjects received the same gift at the end of the session (a cinema voucher). They were instructed about the possible gifts they could receive with the information that the robots and humans would have decided for a gift before the experiment. The instruction contained pictures of four possible gifts, and samples of these gifts were placed on a shelf in the corner of the training room. Although the experimenter did not refer to these samples, they were visible to the subjects. Subjects typically asked questions about the choice task and the gifts; for instance, they confirmed with the experimenter that everybody (humans and robots) would have made a gift choice. Overall, subjects' behavior during instructions and debriefing did not indicate that they did not believe the cover story. (For example, nobody explicitly stated that they did not believe the cover story.) \n\nThe choice trials were designed as follows. In total, nine \u201cchoice contrasts\u201d between the six categories of stimuli (humans without physical impairments, humans with physical impairments, artificial humans, android robots, humanoid robots, mechanoid robots) were implemented. These choice contrasts are shown on the   x  -axis of   B  . The stimulus category of humans without physical impairments was used as a reference to be compared with all other stimulus categories in five of these choice contrasts; the android stimulus category was used as a reference to be compared with all other stimulus categories (except humans without physical impairments) in the remaining four choice contrasts. Within each choice contrast, there were 12 individual choice trials that contrasted specific stimulus exemplars from each category (e.g., a specific human stimulus vs a specific artificial human stimulus). Each of these 12 individual choice trials, comparing a pair of specific stimuli, occurred only once in the experiment. With respect to the order of presentation on each trial, these 12 choice trials were balanced: six comparisons started with a picture from one stimulus category and six started with pictures of the other category. This design resulted in a total of 108 choice trials (12 choice trials contrasting specific stimuli \u00d7 nine choice contrasts). \n\n\n##### Behavioral data analysis. \n  \nTo analyze the rating data, we performed one-way repeated-measures ANOVA with stimulus category (shown on   x  -axis of   C  ) as factor. Separate ANOVAs were performed for ratings of likability, humanlikeness and familiarity. We tested relationships between these rating variables using Pearson correlation and linear regression. \n\nWe focused on the artificial human stimuli to investigate the UV effect for the following reasons. These stimuli were conceptually very interesting as they were derived from actual human photographs and thus followed Pollick's approach ( ) that humans can also fall in the UV when they sufficiently deviate from the typical human appearance. By contrast, android robots are often perceived to be robots because of their stiff posture and/or their visible mechanical parts. Therefore, we created artificial humans as a new category of stimuli that resemble android robots in their unnatural (synthetic) appearance but without visible mechanical parts or stiff posture and instead altered facial and head\u2013body proportions and gray skin tone. Based on this design, artificial humans were thus conceptually closer to actual humans than android robots on a theoretically motivated humanlikeness continuum ( ;  ). We also found in separate pretests and in our main rating task that artificial humans were relatively less liked than android robots, likely because android robots offer relatively obvious cues regarding their status as machines, including stiff posture and visible mechanical parts, compared with the more subtle cues in artificial humans. We indicate in the Results that the main effects of defining the UV were robust when also including android robots in the analyses. \n\nFor analysis of choice data we used multiple logistic regression analysis. All regressions were performed at the random-effects level (i.e., regression coefficients were estimated separately for each subject and then entered into one-sample   t   tests at the group level to assess statistical significance). To assess the influence of the different rating differences we performed the following logistic regression:\n  where   y   is the observed choice on a single trial (0 for choice of first presented stimulus, 1 for choice of second presented stimulus),   likability   is the relative difference in rated likability between the first presented stimulus and second presented stimulus (calculated from the subject-specific and stimulus-specific likability rating given in the rating task),   familiarity   is the relative difference in rated familiarity between the first presented stimulus and second presented stimulus (calculated from the subject-specific and stimulus-specific familiarity rating given in the rating task),   humanlikeness   is the relative difference in rated humanlikeness between the first presented stimulus and second presented stimulus (calculated from the subject-specific and stimulus-specific humanlikeness rating given in the rating task), \u03b2  is the constant term, \u03b2  to \u03b2  are the corresponding parameter estimates (regression coefficients), and \u03b5 is the residual. Accordingly, a subject's \u201cdecision variable\u201d (cf.   D  ) was modeled as follows:\n  Where   likability  ,   familiarity  ,   and humanlikeness   are the trial-by-trial relative rating differences as described above and \u03b2  to \u03b2  are the corresponding parameter estimates defined for each subject by the logistic regression described above. Thus, we modeled a subject's decision variable as a linear combination of subjectively weighted decision attributes. \n\nFor the analysis shown in   D  , we binned the decision variable into equally populated bins (shown on the   x  -axis of   D  ) and then determined the choice probability for each of these bins (as the number of observed choices for the first or second stimulus divided by the number of total choices in each bin); these data are represented by the circles in   D  . The line in   D   was obtained from fitting a logit function. For the analysis shown in   E  , we focused on the five choice contrasts that compared humans without physical impairments to all other stimulus categories. For each choice contrast, we calculated the average absolute (unsigned) value of the decision variable, which we term \u201c\u0394   Decision variable  \u201d. Thus, larger values for \u0394   Decision variable   would indicate that on average, subjects evaluated the stimulus categories as very different in terms of their preference, and accordingly would have a strong preference for one category over the other. \n\n\n##### fMRI data acquisition. \n  \nFunctional MRI scanning was performed with a 7 T whole-body MRI system (Magnetom 7T, Siemens Healthcare) at the Erwin L. Hahn Institute for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Essen, Germany. The system is equipped with the SC72 gradient system capable of 70 mT/m maximum amplitude and a slew rate of 200 mT/m/ms. For this experiment, the scanner was equipped with a 1 channel transmit/ 32-channel receive head coil (Nova Medical). For each participant, a T1-weighted high-resolution anatomical scan (same slice prescription as EPI) and magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) were acquired for registration purposes (repetition time (TR) = 2500 ms, echo time (TE) = 1.27 ms, inversion time (TI) = 1100 ms, flip angle = 7\u00b0, field of view (FOV) = 270 \u00d7 236 mm , matrix = 394 \u00d7 345, sagittal plane, slice thickness = 0.7 mm, 256 slices with a noninterpolated voxel size of 0.7 \u00d7 0.7 \u00d7 0.7 mm ). For the acquisition of functional images, subjects were scanned in six subsequent sessions, each lasting about 12 min to acquire a total of 2022 volumes (331 \u2013 343 volumes per session). In addition, subjects were scanned during two functional localizer tasks not used in the present paper, each lasting about 90 s. Whole-brain functional T2*-weighted EPI were acquired with a BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) contrast-sensitive EPI sequence ( , ) optimized for 7.0 T (slice thickness, 1.51 mm; 144 coronal slices; TR = 2000 ms; TE = 22 ms; flip angle, 14\u00b0; matrix, 170 \u00d7 170; FOV = 256 \u00d7 256 mm , order of acquisition of slices: interleaved). As head coil array allows massive parallel imaging, the GRAPPA (generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions) algorithm was used with a reduction factor of   r   = 9 to reconstruct the undersampled   k  -space ( ). B0 field maps were acquired before the EPI sequence. \n\n\n##### fMRI data analysis. \n  \nWe performed the fMRI data analysis using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London). Preprocessing included realignment of functional data including motion correction, normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate system, and smoothing with a Gaussian kernel with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 6 mm. A high-pass temporal filter with a cutoff period of 128 s was applied. General linear models (GLMs) assuming first-order autoregression were applied to the time course of activation in which event onsets were modeled as single impulse response functions convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Time derivatives were included in the basis functions set. Linear contrasts of parameter estimates were defined to test specific effects in each individual dataset. Voxel values for each contrast resulted in a statistical parametric map of the corresponding   t   statistic. In the second (group random-effects) stage, subject-specific linear contrasts of these parameter estimates were entered into one-sample   t   tests, as described below, resulting in group-level statistical parametric maps. For parametric modulators, we used the standard SPM8 settings by which regressors are orthogonalized in the order they are entered into the design matrix. To test that our results are robust with respect to regressor orthogonalization, we performed ROI time course analyses (described below) in which regressors competed to explain variance in the absence of orthogonalization. Shared variances between our main variables of interest, computed within subjects and then averaged across subjects, were as follows: likability and familiarity,   R   = 0.39 (\u00b1 0.05); likability and humanlikeness,   R   = 0.26 (\u00b1 0.03); familiarity and humanlikeness,   R   = 0.36 (\u00b1 0.04); likability and human detection,   R   = 0.24 (\u00b1 0.03); familiarity and human detection,   R   = 0.24 (\u00b1 0.03); humanlikeness and human detection,   R   = 0.39 (\u00b1 0.03). Variance inflation factors (VIF) in our GLMs were within acceptable limits (mean VIF = 2.28 \u00b1 0.19;  ). For the rating regressors in SPM analyses and ROI analyses we did not perform any weighting of the different rating variables but simply entered the mean-centered variables as regressors in the GLM. We estimated the following GLMs to test specific hypotheses as follows. \n\n\n##### GLM 1. \n  \nThis GLM served three purposes: (1) to identify brain areas with rating-task activity related to rated likability, familiarity, and humanlikeness (see   A  ,   A  ,  I  ); (2) to identify brain areas with choice-task activity related to the main decision variable and to rated decision confidence (see   A  ,   A  ); (3) to identify brain areas with higher activity in the choice task than in the rating task (see  ). For each subject, we estimated a GLM with the following regressors of interest: (R1) an indicator function for the stimulus onset during the rating task; (R2) R1 modulated by the trial-specific humanlikeness rating; (R3) R1 modulated by the trial-specific likability rating; (R4) R1 modulated by the trial-specific familiarity rating; (R5) an indicator function for the onset of the rating scales; (R6) an indicator function for the onset of the first stimulus during the choice task; (R7) an indicator function for the onset of the second stimulus during the choice task; (R8) R7 modulated by the trial-specific decision variable; (R9) R7 modulated by the trial-specific confidence rating; (R10) an indicator function for the onset of the choice phase; (R11) to (R16) the motion parameters resulting from the realignment preprocessing step as covariates of no interest; (R17) to (R22) six session constants. [Note that (R1) to (R16) were defined separately for each scanning session.] \n\n\n##### GLM 2. \n  \nThis GLM served to identify brain areas with choice-task activity related to the relative humanlikeness (see   H  ). For each subject we estimated a GLM with the following regressors of interest: (R1) to (R6) as above; (R7) an indicator function for the onset of the second stimulus during the choice task; (R8) R7 modulated by the trial-specific confidence rating; (R9) R7 modulated by the trial-specific relative likability; (R10) R8 modulated by the trial-specific relative familiarity; (R11) R18 modulated by the trial-specific relative humanlikeness; (R12) an indicator function for the onset of the choice phase; (R13) an indicator function for the onset of the confidence rating scale; (R14) to (R20) the motion parameters resulting from the realignment preprocessing step as covariates of no interest; (R21) to (R26) six session constants. (Note that R1-R20 were defined separately for each scanning session.) \n\n\n##### GLM 3. \n  \nThis GLM served to identify brain areas with differential activity between specific stimulus categories (see   E  ,   E  ). For each subject, we estimated a GLM with the following regressors of interest: (R1) to (R6) indicator functions for the stimulus onsets during the rating task for each of the six stimulus categories defined above; (R7) an indicator function for the onset of the rating scales; (R8) to (R16) indicator functions for the onsets of the first stimulus during the choice task for each of the nine choice contrasts defined above; (R17) to (R25) indicator functions for the onsets of the second stimulus during the choice task for each of the nine choice contrasts defined above; (R26) an indicator function for the onset of the choice phase; (R27) to (R32) the motion parameters resulting from the realignment preprocessing step as covariates of no interest; (R33) to (R38) six session constants. [Note that (R1) to (R32) were defined separately for each scanning session.] \n\n\n##### Functional connectivity analysis. \n  \nWe assessed functional connectivity using the psychophysiological interaction (PPI) approach ( ;  ). For each subject, we first extracted eigenvariates for a 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 voxel cluster around a seed voxel based on the peak voxels identified by a contrast between the choice task and the rating task. The peak voxel used for each subject was determined using a leave-one-subject-out procedure by reestimating our second level analysis 21 times, each time leaving out one subject. Starting at the respective peak voxel for correlation with sequence length we selected the nearest peak in these cross-validation analyses. Time courses were deconvolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) to construct a time series of neural activity in the ROI. The regressors were constructed using the standard deconvolution procedure as implemented in SPM8 ( ). For each model, we calculated single-subject first-level contrasts for the PPI regressor (R1) that were then entered into a second level analysis by calculating a one-sample   t   test across the single subject coefficients. We estimated the following PPI GLMs. \n\n\n##### PPI 1. \n  \nThis GLM tested for differential coupling between brain areas as a function of stimulus category (humans vs nonhumans) in the rating task. A schematic summary of the results is shown in   J  . The model contained the following regressors: (R1) a PPI regressor between the time series of activity in a seed brain area, extracted as just described, and a contrast between trials with human stimuli and nonhuman stimuli; (R2) the time series of activity in a seed brain area, extracted as just described; (R3) a contrast between human vs nonhuman stimuli; (R4\u2013R9) the motion parameters resulting from the realignment preprocessing step as covariates of no interest; (R10-R15) six session constants. [Note that (R1) to (R9) were defined separately for each scanning session.] This model was estimated for the seed region DMPFC. \n\n\n##### PPI 2. \n  \nThis GLM tested for differential coupling between brain areas as a function of task (choice task vs rating phase). A schematic summary of the results is shown in   J  . The model contained the following regressors: (R1) a psychophysiological interaction regressor between the time series of activity in a seed brain area, extracted as just described, and a contrast between choice task vs rating task; (R2) the time series of activity in a seed brain area, extracted as just described; (R3) a contrast between choice task vs rating task; (R4-R9) the motion parameters resulting from the realignment preprocessing step as covariates of no interest; (R10-R15) six session constants. [Note that (R1) to (R9) were defined separately for each scanning session.] This model was estimated for the seed regions TPJ, VMPFC, FFG, DMPFC, and amygdala. \n\n\n##### Statistical significance   test  ing. \n  \nFor all fMRI analyses, we report effects that survive correction for multiple comparisons across the whole brain using a significance level of   p   < 0.05 (family-wise error) at cluster level, imposed on maps that were displayed at cluster-defining threshold of   p   < 0.005 with minimum cluster size of   k   = 10 contiguous voxels. In addition, we used small volume correction (  p   < 0.05, cluster-level) in structures for which we had strong a priori hypotheses based on previous studies, including the VMPFC, ventral striatum, DMPFC, and amygdala. Small volume corrections were performed in spheres of 10 mm radius for cortical areas (VMPFC, DMPFC) and spheres of 6 mm radius for subcortical areas (ventral striatum, amygdala). The spheres were centered on specific coordinates reported in previous studies as follows. VMPFC [\u22122 40 \u22124] and ventral striatum [10 14 \u22124], taken from a meta-analysis of value-based decision making ( ); amygdala: [18, \u22126, \u221222] taken from a previous study of value-based decisions using a similar experimental design to the present study but with different kinds of stimuli ( ); DMPFC [2 44 36] taken from a previous study of social decision making ( ). For DMPFC, we chose this particular study for our coordinate definition as it investigated DMPFC function in a task that required evaluating social others' performance to guide own decisions. We reasoned that similar processes might be engaged in our task, which required subjects to decide which agent would be capable of selecting a personal gift for them. Significant effects for humanlikeness and human\u2013nonhuman contrast in DMPFC were also found when defining coordinates based on the Neurosynth meta-analysis database ( ), which localizes DMPFC at [0 56 22] using the search term \u201csocial.\u201d \n\n\n##### ROI analysis. \n  \nTo ensure that statistical inference in our ROI analyses was not circular, we followed approaches used in previous studies ( ;  ;  ;  ). Specifically, we used a leave-one-subject-out method in which we reestimated a second-level analysis 21 times, each time leaving out one subject to define the ROI coordinates for the left-out subject. We then extracted the signal from the subject-specific coordinates defined in this way. Thus, the data which we used for the ROI analysis were independent from those used to define the coordinates for extracting the signal. Following data extraction we applied a high-pass filter with a cutoff period of 128 s. The data were then   z  -normalized, oversampled by a factor of 10 using sinc interpolation, and separated into trials to produce a matrix of trials against time. We generated separate matrices for each event of interest (rating trials, choice trials). We then fitted GLMs to each oversampled time point across trials separately in each subject. \n\nFor the rating task, our analysis strategy for ROI analyses was as follows: We first fitted a GLM containing as main regressors the three (parametrically varying) rating variables likability, humanlikeness and familiarity. We then tested whether the model fit was improved by inclusion of an additional binary human detection regressor that modeled the difference between human and nonhuman stimuli. We accepted this extended GLM if it yielded a better model fit as assessed with Akaike information criterion and significant human detection regressor. In the figures, we plot the standardized regression coefficients for significant regressors only; we report in the Results text which model provided the best fit and which regressors were significant. In addition to these regressors, the GLMs included motion parameters and session constants as covariates of no interest. This GLM analysis yielded one regression coefficient for each regressor for every oversampled time point in each subject. We entered individual-subject coefficients into one-sample   t   tests (random-effects analysis,   p   < 0.05) and calculated group averages and SEs for each time point across participants, yielding the across-subject effect size time courses shown in the figures. These mean effect size time courses are shown in   B  ;  ,   B  ,   F  , and   J  ;  ,   B  ,   F  , and   H  ; and  ,   B   and   C  . \n\nTo test for relationships between specific behavioral and neural effect sizes, we extracted neural effects sizes from individual subject's data using the leave-one-out procedure described above. We only tested for these relationships if a ROI showed a significant effect in the tested variable. We performed linear regression to produce the plots shown in the figures. We tested statistical significance using Pearson correlation. As the behavioral UV depths in the rating task and choice task entered these analyses multiple times, we performed a Bonferroni correction. Specifically, we obtained a   p  -value of   p   < 0.0125 for tests involving the behavioral UV depth in the rating task and a   p  -value of   p   < 0.0167 for tests involving behavioral UV depth in the choice task. The resulting effect size scatter plots are shown in   D  ;  ,   D  ,   H  , and   L  ;  ,   D   and   I  ; and   D  . \n\n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral UV reactions in the rating task \n  \nSubjects performed a psychophysical rating task in which they evaluated humans and different kinds of artificial agents on the key dimensions of the UV hypothesis, including humanlikeness, likability, and familiarity (  A  ,  B  ). Our approach to evoke UV reactions followed two concepts: First, we followed Mori's original hypothesis that likability increases with humanlikeness but sharply decreases for highly humanlike artificial agents ( ;  ). Second, we followed the argument that humans can also fall in the UV if they significantly deviate from typical human appearance or behavior ( ). Accordingly, we tested not only humanlike androids but, to elicit strong UV reactions, we designed \u201cartificial humans\u201d derived from photographs of humans with artificially altered facial features. These artificial or synthetic humans were more humanlike than typical androids but deviated from human appearance by having exaggerated smooth, flawless, unnatural faces and slightly unnatural proportions. \n  \nBehavioral UV reactions.    A   , Rating task. Subjects evaluated UV-relevant dimensions of humans and artificial agents.    B   , Example stimuli. (   Bi   ) Artificial humans; (   Bii   ) androids; (   Biii   ) humanoid robots; (   Biv   ) mechanoid robots. Human examples are not shown.    C   , Humanlikeness ratings for stimulus categories (MechR: mechanoid robots; HumR: humanoid robots; AndR: android robots; ArtificH: artificial humans; HumPhys: humans with physical impairments; HumNPhys: humans without physical impairments). Relatively lower ratings were found for HumNPhys compared with HumPhys due to lower familiarity (see text).    D   \u2013   G   , UV effect in likability.    D   , Likability ratings for all stimuli. Black line: third-order polynomial fit (  R   = 0.573).    E   , Likability for artificial humans showed the UV-characteristic drop, indicating deviation from linear relationship between humanlikeness and likability.    F   , Quantifying UV depth. UV definition in single subject's likability ratings. Black line: linear regression-fit of likability to humanlikeness continuum from all stimuli (gray data) except UV-relevant artificial humans (red data). Blue point: predicted likability for artificial humans from linear fit; red point: observed likability. UV depth defined as difference between predicted and observed likability.    G   , UV depths across subjects. The procedure in    F    defined UV depths, illustrated for three individual subjects (top) and all subjects (bottom;   p   = 3.47 \u00d7 10 , one-sample   t   test). UV effects were not found in several controls (e.g., humanoid robots;   p   > 0.15, one-sample   t   test). Error bars indicate SEM. \n  \nIn total, we used four categories of artificial agents (  B  ), based on independent pretests: (1) \u201cartificial humans,\u201d (2) \u201candroid robots,\u201d (3) \u201chumanoid robots,\u201d and (4) \u201cmechanoid robots.\u201d We hypothesized that the humanlike artificial agents (in particular artificial humans, and androids) would fall in the UV, i.e., having lower likability ratings than predicted by a humanlikeness continuum (defined in the next paragraph), whereas less humanlike robots (humanoid and mechanoid robots) should lie outside the UV. As controls, we included photographs of humans with and without physical impairments, the former having presumed lower familiarity than the latter. \n\nStimulus categories differed significantly in rated likability (  F   = 46.19;   p   < 0.001; \u03b7  = 0.698; repeated-measures ANOVA), familiarity (  F   = 54.82;   p   < 0.001; \u03b7  = 0.733) and humanlikeness (  F   = 119.95;   p   < 0.001; \u03b7  = 0.857). As predicted from the UV hypothesis, subjects evaluated the stimulus categories along a humanlikeness continuum (  C  ,   r   = 0.980,   p   = 0.0006, linear regression): mechanoid and humanoid robots constituted the low end of this continuum, humans constituted the high end, and the UV-relevant artificial humans and android robots were rated intermediately humanlike. [Slightly lower ratings for humans with physical impairments, compared with those without physical impairments, were explained by lower familiarity: humanlikeness and likability ratings depended on familiarity ratings for humans with physical impairments (both R > 0.5,   p   < 0.05, Pearson correlation) but not for humans without physical impairments (  p   > 0.22)]. Within this observed humanlikeness continuum, we next measured UV reactions in likability. \n\nAcross all stimuli, likability tended to increase with humanlikeness (  D  ). The key prediction of Mori's UV hypothesis is that, although likability generally increases with humanlikeness, highly humanlike artificial agents are less likable than predicted by a humanlikeness continuum, and thereby fall in the UV. Consistent with this prediction, likability ratings for artificial humans (and some specific androids) were lower than expected based on their rated humanlikeness (  D  ). As proposed by the UV hypothesis ( ) and found in previous work (depending on the appearance dimension that was varied, for instance, prototypicality ( )), likability data were well described by a cubic polynomial fit (  R   = 0.573,   D  ), with consistent results in individual subjects' fits (mean   R   = 0.362 \u00b1 0.03). A distinct UV effect was visible in the average likability of artificial humans, which was lower than expected based on the humanlikeness continuum (  E  ). Thus, ratings across subjects and stimuli indicated the existence of a UV effect. \n\n\n### Modeling the UV \n  \nTo examine neural correlates of UV reactions, it was critical to first model and quantify the UV psychometrically within individual subjects. As we observed the most pronounced UV effect for artificial humans, we focused on this stimulus category (see Materials and Methods; including android stimuli yielded similar results). \n\nWe used a direct approach and quantified the UV effect as the extent to which likability ratings for artificial humans deviated from a linear fit of likability to humanlikeness, calculated across all other stimulus categories (\u201cUV depth,\u201d   F  ). This approach captured Mori's original notion of the UV: an individual subject would have a stronger UV reaction (i.e., a deeper UV) if likability ratings for humanlike stimuli were lower than linearly predicted from that subject's humanlikeness ratings.   F   illustrates the approach and resulting UV depth in one example subject, with further examples and across-subjects distribution shown in   G  . The visible downward deflections of likability from linear humanlikeness fits (  F  ,  G  , compare red and blue data points, indicating observed likability and likability predicted from humanlikeness, respectively) implied that artificial humans were less liked than expected from a linear humanlikeness function. \n\nWe found robust behavioral UV reactions in the rating data. Despite considerable interindividual variation, UV depths for artificial humans were significantly larger than predicted from humanlikeness (indicating lower likability than predicted;   p   = 3.47 \u00d7 10 , one-sample   t   test). UV depth was significant in 18 of 21 individual subjects (  p   < 0.05, one-sample   t   tests). (Weaker but significant UV reactions were found for familiarity (  p   = 1.9 \u00d7 10 ) but, as expected, not for humanlikeness (  p   = 0.117)). A significant UV effect was also found when including both artificial humans and androids (  p   = 6.1 \u00d7 10 ). As controls, UV depths were nonsignificant for stimuli not hypothesized to fall in the UV, (e.g., humans with physical impairments or humanoid robots; both   p   > 0.15, one-sample   t   tests), for which likability was well predicted by a linear humanlikeness fit. \n\nWe confirmed the robustness of these results by an alternative approach to model the UV based on regression residuals. Within subjects, we fitted six linear regressions of likability ratings on humanlikeness ratings (cf.   D  ), each time leaving out the data from one of the six stimulus categories. We then applied the estimated regression coefficients on the data of the left-out category to predict likability from humanlikeness and noted the regression residuals (i.e., the variance in likability not explained by humanlikeness given the specific regression coefficients). According to the UV hypothesis, these residuals should be significantly more negative for the UV-relevant artificial humans (and possibly android robots) compared with other stimulus categories. Indeed, residuals for artificial humans were significantly smaller (more negative) than those for all other agents (all comparisons   p   < 0.005,   t   test, corrected for multiple comparisons), while the residuals for androids were significantly smaller than those for humanoids and humans without physical disabilities (both   p   < 0.005). The UV effect quantified within each subject based on these residuals was highly correlated with our main measure of the UV effect (  r   = 0.7486,   p   = 9.4 \u00d7 10 , Pearson correlation). Thus, this procedure provided additional validation for the existence of a UV effect in the behavioral data. \n\nThus, behavioral data confirmed the existence of a UV reaction in our stimulus set and validated the rating task to search for neural correlates of subjective UV reactions. We next investigated how neural systems might transform a linear humanlikeness function into a nonlinear UV function. \n\n\n### A neural UV in VMPFC \n  \nTo locate neural correlates of UV reactions, we regressed stimulus-evoked activity in the rating task on trial-by-trial rated likability, which was the key rating to reflect the UV (shown above). Likability evaluations were encoded in typical reward areas, including VMPFC (  A  ,  B  ). Additionally, VMPFC activity reflected humanlikeness ratings (  B  ). Because likability and humanlikeness were covariates, these variables accounted for different activity-components. Familiarity did not explain VMPFC activity. (All ROI analyses used leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to identify subject-specific, independent ROI coordinates, ensuring unbiased analysis;  ;  ). ROI regressions were performed without orthogonalization. All three ratings were included as regressors; in addition, we tested in a second GLM whether a binary human detection contrast would improve model fit (see Materials and Methods).] We tested whether the GLM in the ROI analysis was improved by inclusion of a binary \u201chuman detection\u201d regressor that contrasted human and nonhuman stimuli. (For this contrast, nonhuman agents involved mechanoid, humanoid, android and artificial-human stimuli.) Inclusion of this human detection regressor did not change the significant effects for likability and humanlikeness shown in   B  ; although the human detection regressor itself showed a significant effect on VMPFC activity, this occurred quite late outside our primary analysis window (  p   = 0.033, one-sample   t   test at 9 s poststimulus onset). Thus, VMPFC integrated the two key UV-dimensions likability and humanlikeness, suggesting a role in UV reactions. \n  \nUV in VMPFC.    A   , VMPFC signaled subjective likability. Activity during rating task reflected trial-by-trial likability ratings (  p   < 0.05, whole-brain corrected at cluster level; all statistical maps thresholded at   p   < 0.005, uncorrected for display purposes).    B   , Integration of likability and humanlikeness. ROI regression of VMPFC activity on likability (  t   = 2.93,   p   = 0.008; one-sample   t   test in random-effects analysis) and humanlikeness (  t   = 3.45,   p   = 0.003).    C   , VMPFC activity encodes UV reactions. As for likability ratings, VMPFC responses to artificial humans were lower than expected based on humanlikeness continuum. Black line: linear regression-fit of VMPFC activity to humanlikeness continuum from all stimuli except UV-relevant artificial humans (  r   = 0.268,   p   = 0.008, Pearson correlation). Blue point: predicted VMPFC response for artificial humans from linear fit; red point: measured response. UV depth defined as difference between predicted and measured response (deviation from linear fit:   t   = \u22122.97,   p   = 0.008, one-sample   t   test).    D   , Neural UV depths matched behavioral UV depths. Linear regression of behavioral UV depths (  F  ) on neural UV depths in VMPFC activity (  p   = 0.006; significant robust regression; mean-centered neural UV depths extracted from independently defined coordinates using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation). \n  \nIf a brain area signaled the key UV dimension likability, it might also explicitly represent the UV reaction. (In an \u201cexplicit\u201d UV representation, activity patterns across stimuli should match the prototypical UV shape.) Consistent with this notion, VMPFC activity across stimuli closely resembled the behavioral UV reaction (  C  ): activity increased approximately linearly according to humanlikeness for most stimuli, but responses to artificial humans were significantly lower than expected from a linear humanlikeness fit (  C  ;   p   = 0.008, one-sample   t   test). VMPFC activity thus followed the typical UV shape with selectively lower activity for highly humanlike artificial agents. Across subjects, neural UV depths (derived from individual subjects' VMPFC activities) matched subjects' behavioral UV reactions (  D  ;   r   = 0.576,   p   = 0.006, Pearson correlation, Bonferroni corrected). When calculating this across-subjects effect with the alternative UV-quantification based on regression residuals (described above), the relationship with neural UV depths in VMPFC was weaker (  r   = 0.41,   p   = 0.062). Accordingly, the relationship to individual differences should be considered exploratory. \n\nThus, VMPFC activity integrated the key UV dimensions likability and humanlikeness to an explicit representation of the UV reaction. The strength of this representation partly explained individual differences in behavioral reactions toward artificial agents. \n\n\n### Linear and nonlinear humanlikeness signals as neural basis for the UV \n  \nWe next searched for activities related to the UV dimension humanlikeness. We reasoned that different types of humanlikeness signals might constitute neural inputs required for transforming the psychophysical humanlikeness continuum (  C  ) into the nonlinear UV representation observed in VMPFC (  C  ). \n\nNeural responses to human and artificial stimuli in TPJ, DMPFC, and part of fusiform gyrus (FFG) were related to humanlikeness ratings ( ,  ). TPJ activity showed a positive linear relationship with humanlikeness (  A\u2013C  ): it gradually increased across stimuli and faithfully reflected the humanlikeness continuum. Likability and familiarity did not show significant effects on TPJ activity; a human detection regressor was not significant and its inclusion did not affect the significance of the humanlikeness regressor. TPJ thus provided a parametric, linear humanlikeness signal\u2014the most basic element of the UV hypothesis. \n  \nLinear and nonlinear humanlikeness coding.    A   , Linear coding of subjective humanlikeness in TPJ. Activity reflected trial-by-trial humanlikeness ratings (  p   < 0.05, whole-brain corrected).    B   , ROI regression of TPJ activity on humanlikeness (with likability and familiarity covariates;   t   = 3.47,   p   = 0.002, one-sample   t   test in random-effects analysis).    C   , TPJ activity closely followed the humanlikeness continuum.    D   , TPJ humanlikeness sensitivity reflected subjects' behavioral UV depths. Linear regression of behavioral UV-depth (cf.   F  ) on TPJ humanlikeness \u03b2s (significant robust regression).    E   , Stronger DMPFC activation for humans vs nonhumans shown by contrast analysis ([10 48 14],   z  -score = 4.78,   p   = 0.001, whole-brain corrected).    F   , Regression of DMPFC activity on human detection (  t   = 2.26,   p   = 0.036) and humanlikeness (  p   = 0.603; nonsignificant likability and familiarity covariates).    G   , Selective DMPFC response to humans.    H   , Linear regression of behavioral UV depths on DMPFC human-detection \u03b2s (significant robust regression).    I   , Negative humanlikeness coding in FFG (  p   < 0.05, whole-brain corrected).    J   , Regression of FFG activity on human-detection (  t   = \u22122.26,   p   = 0.034) and humanlikeness (  t   = \u22123.56,   p   = 0.0019). Inset: significant \u03b2-difference for humanlikeness and human-detection.    K   , FFG activity across stimulus categories.    L   , FFG nonlinear humanlikeness sensitivity reflected behavioral UV depths (significant robust regression). \n    \nRating task analyses \n    \nBy contrast, humanlikeness coding in DMPFC was more complex. Although we found a significant relationship with parametric humanlikeness ( , GLM1), a binary contrast showed significantly stronger activation by human agents compared with nonhuman agents (  E  ; GLM3, contrasting mechanoid, humanoid, android robots and artificial humans with both human stimulus categories). Detailed ROI analysis indicated that neural activity in this DMPFC area was best explained by a human detection contrast as follows. Across stimuli, DMPFC activity followed the humanlikeness continuum for nonhuman agents but then sharply increased for human agents (  E\u2013G  ). We modeled this activity with a \u201chuman detection\u201d regressor (  F  ,   a   dummy variable distinguishing human from nonhuman stimuli) in addition to linear humanlikeness (improvement in GLM fit was assessed by Akaike Information Criterion). (Although   C   and   G   may look similar, it is important to note that these data are averaged across trials and subjects; our ROI analysis within each subject indicated that, whereas VMPFC activity was best explained by joint likability and human likeness coding, DMPFC activity was best explained by a human detection regressor.) Thus, DMPFC activity emphasized differences between human and nonhuman stimuli, suggesting a role in distinguishing human from artificial agents. \n\nFFG exhibited a third type of humanlikeness signal. It showed a negative parametric relationship with humanlikeness selectively for nonhuman stimuli and an average response to human stimuli (  I\u2013K  , modeled in the same way as DMPFC activity). Both humanlikeness and human detection explained significant variance in FFG activity (  J  , inset). Thus, FFG combined a human detection response with negative humanlikeness coding selectively for artificial agents. \n\nIf TPJ, DMPFC and FFG contributed to UV reactions, their sensitivity to humanlikeness should reflect individuals' UV depths. Indeed, all three areas encoded humanlikeness more strongly for subjects with stronger UV reactions (  D  ,  H  ,  L  ). [These relationships were significant for humanlikeness coefficients (  p   < 0.05, Pearson correlation); in DMPFC, the effect was strongest for human-detection and in FFG for differential humanlikeness.] Similar effects were not found in control analyses with non-UV stimulus categories (  p   > 0.6). We note that the effect in   L   did not survive Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons; accordingly, we treat this result as an exploratory finding. \n\nThus, TPJ, DMPFC, and FFG encoded distinct linear and nonlinear humanlikeness signals that were related to individuals' UV reactions. \n\n\n### Modeling the neural UV from humanlikeness signals \n  \nThese data suggest a possible information-processing sequence, whereby a linear humanlikeness code in TPJ is transformed to nonlinear humanlikeness codes in DMPFC and FFG and eventually to an explicit UV representation (i.e., nonlinear likability) in VMPFC. Specifically, the observed FFG signal seemed to track the proximity to a human\u2013nonhuman boundary (decreasing activity selectively for non-humans), which seems suited for determining the UV-typical likability-drop for the most humanlike artificial agents. The DMPFC human-detection signal might be relevant for setting up such selective humanlikeness signaling. \n\nConsistent with these notions, a simple multiplicative integration of linear and nonlinear humanlikeness signals in TPJ and FFG approximated the UV-related activity pattern in VMPFC (  A  ). Such multiplicative signal integration is biologically plausible and routinely used in models of neural multisensory integration ( ;  ;  ;  ). Across subjects, the strengths of the humanlikeness components in TPJ and FFG were related to the neural UV-effect in VMPFC (  B  ,  C  ), suggesting these combined signals were relevant for the observed UV effect in VMPFC. \n  \nConstructing the UV from linear and nonlinear humanlikeness signals.    A   , Combining humanlikeness signals in TPJ and FFG to construct nonlinear likability in VMPFC. Top, Measured activity patterns (across subjects) in TPJ, FFG, and VMPFC. Multiplicative combination of measured TPJ and FFG signals (\u201ccomputed\u201d) approximated the observed neural UV in VMPFC (\u201cmeasured\u201d). Bottom, Modeled signals. TPJ activity modeled by linear humanlikeness function; FFG activity modeled as inverse, linear humanlikeness function (negative linear relation across hypothesized humanlikeness continuum), selectively for nonhumans, with undifferentiated (average) response to human stimuli; VMPFC activity modeled as multiplicative combination of these signals.    B   ,    C   , Relation between neural humanlikeness sensitivities and neural UV depth in VMPFC across subjects.    B   , Linear regression of TPJ humanlikeness on VMPFC UV depth (significant robust regression).    C   , Linear regression of FFG humanlikeness on VMPFC UV depth (significant robust regression). \n  \nThus, the neural UV code in VMPFC could be approximated by multiplicative integration of humanlikeness signals from TPJ and FFG. We next tested in a second experiment how these activities were related to behavioral choices toward artificial agents. \n\n\n### UV reactions guiding decision making \n  \nIn a second experimental task (  A  ), subjects viewed sequential human and artificial agents and chose from whom they would rather receive a personal gift. We instructed subjects that each human and artificial agent had selected a gift from an option set, and that they would receive one of these gifts based on their choices for the different agents during the experiment. Actual gift choices were unknown to the subjects; they had to decide whom they would trust to select an attractive gift. We reasoned that this situation likely encouraged subjects to compare humans and artificial agents on UV-relevant dimensions. \n  \nDecision making to accept or reject artificial agents.    A   , Choice task. Subjects viewed sequential stimuli and decided from whom they would like to receive a gift (example from categories android robots (first screen) and artificial humans (second screen); shown without black bar during the experiment.    B   , Choice behavior. Probability for gift-acceptance from humans (blacks) and androids (gray) over other stimulus categories.    C   , Modeling choices with logistic regression. \u03b2 weights of relative likability, familiarity and humanlikeness (all   p   < 0.002, ones-sample   t   tests).    D   , Psychometric function: Relation between decision variable and choice probability. Relative differences in likability, familiarity and humanlikeness were weighted for individual subjects, based on subject-specific logistic regression, and summed to form a decision variable. Choice probabilities calculated for equally populated decision-variable bins and fitted with logit function.    E   , Defining UV depth for the choice task, based on decision variable. Unsigned (absolute) differences in decision variable between stimulus categories (\u0394 Decision Variable, derived from stimulus-specific ratings during rating task; data for all subjects). Black line: linear regression-fit to humanlikeness continuum for all conditions (gray data) except choices involving artificial humans (red data). Blue point: predicted decision variable for artificial humans from linear fit; red point: observed decision variable. Choice UV depth defined as difference between predicted and observed decision variable.    F   , Choice UV depth across subjects. The procedure in    F    defined UV depths for all subjects (  p   = 1.1 \u00d7 10 , one-sample   t   test). \n  \nWhen choosing whether to prefer a gift from a human or artificial agent, subjects typically (but not always) preferred humans (  B  , black bars). Choice probabilities were more variable when choosing between artificial agents (gray bars). We next sought to explain subjects' choices in terms of the separately made ratings of key UV dimensions. \n\nIn value-based choice, a decision-maker integrates relevant information to a \u201cdecision variable\u201d (a weighted composite of decision factors) to compare and decide between different options. Accordingly, we reasoned that weighted, comparative valuations of likability, humanlikeness and familiarity guided subjects' choices. We defined trial-specific relative differences in likability, humanlikeness and familiarity based on individual subjects' stimulus ratings (from the rating task). Logistic regression showed that relative likability, familiarity and humanlikeness were significant predictors for subjects' choices: subjects were more likely to accept a gift from an individual they considered relatively more likable, familiar, and humanlike (  C  , all regression coefficients   p   < 0.0002, one-sample   t   tests). The same result was found when considering only choices involving UV-relevant artificial humans and androids (all coefficients   p   < 0.0009, one-sample   t   tests). On average, logistic regression based on relative ratings provided correct choice classification for 85.7% of trials (mean across subjects, \u00b1 0.89, SEM) and resulted in a pseudo-  R   of 0.53 (mean across subjects, \u00b1 0.02, SEM). Choice probabilities were thus well described by a subject-specific decision variable, defined as a weighted sum of relative likability, familiarity, and humanlikeness (  D  ). \n\nTo quantify the UV in the choice task, we examined the decision variable for specific stimulus categories. For this analysis and subsequent neural analyses, we focused on the unsigned decision variable i.e., the absolute value difference. In value-based decisions, neural decision signals often reflect this absolute value difference between choice options; ( ;  , ;  ;  ), which is usually interpreted as the signature of a competitive decision mechanism. \n\nSimilar to likability ratings (  F  ), the decision variable followed a humanlikeness continuum: the more two stimulus categories differed in humanlikeness, the more they also differed in the decision variable (  E  ;   r   = \u22120.533,   p   = 1.8 \u00d7 10 , Pearson correlation), with highest differences for humans versus mechanoid robots and smallest differences for humans with and without physical impairments. (A high difference in the decision variable between stimuli indicated clear choice preference between these stimuli.) However, consistent with the UV hypothesis, the difference in the decision variable between humans and artificial humans was significantly larger than expected from a humanlikeness continuum (  F  ;   t   = 4.66,   p   = 1.52 \u00d7 10 , one-sample   t   test), which matched the UV reaction observed in likability ratings (  D  ). This upward deflection from the linear humanlikeness fit (  E  , difference between red and blue data points, indicating actual difference in decision variable and difference in decision variable estimated from linear humanlikeness fit, respectively) implied a greater difference than expected if the decision variable followed a humanlikeness continuum. This result quantified the UV during choices in terms of individual subjects' decision variable. Choice UV effects were not found for control stimuli (humanoid robots;   p   = 0.505, one-sample   t   test). \n\nThus, choices between humans and artificial agents were based on a decision variable that reflected subjects' individual UV reactions. These data validated the choice task for examining neural correlates of decision making in the context of the UV hypothesis. \n\n\n### Neural UV components during decisions \n  \nA contrast showed that areas involved in the rating task were even more strongly activated in the choice task, including VMPFC, DMPFC, and TPJ ( ). To examine neural UV components during decisions, we regressed choice-task activity (responses to humans and artificial agents at time of the second stimulus on each trial) on individual subjects' decisions variables; that is, the weighted sums of relative likability, familiarity and humanlikeness. \n  \nChoice task analyses \n    \nActivity in VMPFC tracked subjects' decision variable, with stronger activity for larger unsigned value differences (  A  ,  B  ). Similar effects occurred in other areas implicated in decision-related valuations ( ), including striatum and posterior cingulate cortex ( ). VMPFC encoding of the decision variable was not accounted for by subjective decision difficulty: confidence ratings (a common measure of subjective difficulty) explained separate VMPFC activity components (  B  ). Across decision categories, VMPFC activity followed a humanlikeness continuum but deviated significantly for choices involving UV-relevant artificial humans, thereby matching the psychophysical UV (  C  ). (Note that   C   shows VMPFC activity when subjects chose whether to receive a gift from humans compared with different agents, labeled on   x  -axis.) The significant deviation from linear fit for choices between humans and artificial humans (  C  , compare red and blue points) suggested stronger VMPFC activation (indicating more disparate value difference) than expected from a humanlikeness continuum, specifically for artificial agents that elicited UV reactions. Across subjects, this neural UV correlated with subjects' behavioral UV depths (  D  ). Thus, VMPFC encoded the behaviorally important decision variable in close relation to individual differences and reflected UV reactions during decision making. \n  \nNeural UV components during decision making.    A   , VMPFC activity during gift-choices between humans and artificial agents coded subjects' decision variable (  p   < 0.05; small-volume correction). Decision variable used as parametric modulator was the sum of subjectively weighted relative likability, familiarity and humanlikeness, which explained choices (cf.   E  ,   F  ).    B   , ROI regression of VMPFC activity on decision variable (  t   = 2.25,   p   = 0.0356; one-sample   t   test, random-effects analysis) and rated confidence (  t   = 3.48,   p   = 0.002).    C   , VMPFC activity during choices reflects UV. VMPFC responses during choices involving artificial humans deviated from expected humanlikeness continuum. Black line: linear regression-fit of activity on relative humanlikeness for all stimuli except artificial humans (  r   = \u22120.248,   p   = 0.023, Pearson correlation). Blue point: predicted response for artificial humans from linear fit; red point: measured response.    D   , Linear regression of behavioral choice UV depth (defined in   E  ) on neural UV depth derived from VMPFC activity (  p   = 0.016; significant robust regression).    E   , Stronger activation in VMPFC ([-6 40 \u22126],   z   = 4.21) and DMPFC ([0 56 18],   z   = 3.81) during choices involving humans contrasted with choices without humans (both   p   < 0.001, whole-brain corrected).    F   , DMPFC coded decision variable specifically for choices involving nonhumans (  t   = \u22122.45,   p   = 0.0294, one-sample   t   test); VMPFC coded decision variable specifically for choices involving humans (  t   = 2.139,   p   = 0.044, one-sample   t   test).    G   , TPJ activity reflected the humanlikeness component of the decision variable (  p   < 0.05, whole-brain corrected).    H   , ROI regression of TPJ activity on relative humanlikeness (  t   = 3.678,   p   = 0.0015, one-sample   t   test).    I   , Behavioral UV depths matched TPJ humanlikeness \u03b2s (robust regression).    J   , Functional connectivity. Psychophysiological interactions identified pairs of brain regions with stronger activity-correlations during choices than ratings (magenta connections) or stronger activity-correlations for nonhumans compared with humans (blue connections, rating task). Summary figure based on whole-brain-corrected statistical maps. \n  \nPrevious studies showed separate functions of VMPFC and DMPFC during choices for self and others ( ;  ) and during evaluations of similar and dissimilar others ( ). We therefore examined decision activity of these areas for choices involving humans (vs other stimulus categories) and choices not involving humans (choices among artificial agents). Contrasting decision-trials involving humans and nonhumans showed stronger activation in both DMPFC and VMPFC (  E  ). Given this differential activation, we performed a ROI regression on DMPFC and VMPFC activity in which the decision variable was modeled separately for choices involving humans and choices involving nonhumans. This analysis revealed selective coding of the decision variable in DMPFC for choices involving nonhumans (  F  , top, negative coding scheme). By contrast, VMPFC coded the decision variable specifically for choices involving humans (  F  , bottom, positive coding scheme). Thus, VMPFC and DMPFC coded subjects' decision variable selectively, and complementarily, in a human\u2013nonhuman frame of reference. \n\nRegressing decision activity specifically on relative humanlikeness, a subcomponent of the decision variable important in UV reactions, showed a significant effect in the TPJ region that also encoded humanlikeness during ratings (  G  ,  H  ). Across subjects, TPJ's sensitivity to humanlikeness was related to behavioral UV reactions (  I  ), suggesting behavioral relevance for subjects' choices. Additionally, similar to the rating task, ROI regression on FFG activity showed a significant human-detection contrast (  t   = 2.27,   p   = 0.033, one-sample   t   test) and negative humanlikeness coding (  t   = 4.39,   p   = 0.0003, one-sample   t   test). \n\nWe examined functional connectivity with PPI analyses. We found that TPJ was more strongly connected with both DMPFC and FFG during choices compared with ratings (  J  , magenta,  ), reflecting these areas' observed common humanlikeness encoding. Functional connections also existed between VMPFC and both DMPFC and FFG (  J  , magenta), but we found no direct coupling between VMPFC and TPJ. Thus, areas implicated in valuations of humanlikeness, likability, and subjects' decision variable interacted functionally during decision making. \n  \nPPI analyses \n    \n\n### Amygdala signals for rejecting human and nonhuman agents \n  \nThe amygdala is a subcortical structure involved in emotion and social information processing ( ;  ) that contributes to decision making ( ;  ,  ,  ;  ). Contrast analysis suggested amygdala engagement in the choice task ( ). We therefore examined its role in UV-related decisions. \n\nSimilar to VMPFC, the amygdala encoded subjects' decision variable (  A  ), but with a negative coding scheme whereby higher activity indicated lower decision values (  B  ) and without additional confidence-coding (  p   = 0.741, one-sample   t   test). Unlike VMPFC and DMPFC, the amygdala encoded subjects' decision variable regardless of whether decisions involved humans or nonhuman agents (  C  ,  D  ), suggesting a context-invariant decision signal. As for VMPFC, amygdala's encoding of the decision variable was related to individual differences in UV reactions (  E  , black data). The amygdala was distinct as its coding was directly related to subjects' choice probabilities: subjects with higher amygdala decision-sensitivity were less likely to accept gifts from artificial agents (  E  , orange data). Similar relationships were not found for VMPFC (  p   = 0.777, Pearson correlation) or human gift acceptance (  p   = 0.317). The amygdala was not functionally coupled to other areas, except for a nonsignificant effect in DMPFC. Thus, the amygdala encoded subjects' decision variable, and this coding partly explained gift refusal from UV-relevant artificial agents. \n  \nAmygdala rejection-signals for humans and artificial agents.    A   , Amygdala choice activity coded subjects' decision variable (  p   < 0.05; small-volume correction on predefined amygdala coordinates).    B   , ROI regression showed negative amygdala-coding of decision variable (  t   = \u22123.05,   p   = 0.006, one-sample   t   test).    C   , Significant coding of decision variable for choices involving humans (  p   = 0.0173, one-sample   t   test) and choices without humans (  p   = 0.005).    D   , Amygdala sensitivity to decision variable predicted behavioral UV depths (black data) and gift rejections from artificial agents (orange data). Linear regressions of choice UV depths (  p   = 0.012, robust regression) and probability of gift acceptance from artificial humans and androids (  p   = 0.019, robust regression) on amygdala \u03b2s. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe investigated neural activity when subjects evaluated different attributes of human and artificial agents and made personal decisions about these agents. We found that stimulus-evoked activity in VMPFC, a key valuation structure ( ;  ;  ;  ), matched the characteristic nonlinear shape of the UV reaction ( ;  ): VMPFC responses to human and artificial agents increased according to the psychophysically measured humanlikeness continuum but were markedly decreased for the most humanlike artificial agents (\u201cartificial humans\u201d), which fell in the psychophysically measured UV. Across subjects, the depth of this neural UV\u2014formalized as a deviation from a linear humanlikeness fit\u2014explained individual differences in behavioral UV reactions. VMPFC was a candidate site for computing the UV response, as it jointly encoded humanlikeness and likability signals. Consistently, during decision making, VMPFC activity reflected the UV in terms of a decision variable (derived from subjectively weighted decision attributes) that guided subjects' choices between humans and artificial agents. These data demonstrate a surprisingly direct neural representation of the UV as a nonlinear value function and provide neurobiological evidence for the key prediction of the UV hypothesis that the UV derives from integrated humanlikeness and likability evaluations. \n\nA distinct set of brain areas implicated in social information processing encoded the humanlikeness dimension underlying the UV hypothesis. A humanlikeness continuum was faithfully and linearly encoded by neural responses to artificial agents in the TPJ, consistent with this area's roles in agency-detection ( ), belief-attribution ( ;  ;  ) and learning about others ( ;  ;  ). TPJ thus represented the most basic element of the UV hypothesis, humanlikeness, on a linear scale of neural activity. Such a linear neural representation is computationally useful ( ), as it provides a versatile basis for deriving other, nonlinear neural representations of related variables, as observed in DMPFC, FFG, and VMPFC. Thus, TPJ likely provided important inputs for generating neural UV representations, as also suggested by the observed relationship to individual differences. \n\nBy contrast, the DMPFC, a region implicated in mentalizing ( ;  ), responded particularly strongly to human agents and coded humanlikeness by a nonlinear, step-like function that emphasized differences between humans and nonhumans. Previous studies observed differential DMPFC activity when making choices for self or others ( ), when tracking performance for self or other ( ), and when attributing mental states to others ( ). The present data extend these observations toward a distinction between human and nonhuman social others. Such human-detection activity might be critical in setting up a UV effect as it could set a threshold of \u201chumanlike but not genuinely human\u201d that would trigger the characteristic drop in likability. \n\nThe FFG encoded an additional candidate input for computing UV reactions, by signaling linear humanlikeness with a negative coding scheme up to the human\u2013nonhuman threshold encoded in DMPFC. These activities are consistent with FFG responses to nonliving compared with living entities (e.g., tools vs animals) ( ;  ;  ;  ). Our data suggest that preferential FFG responses to nonliving entities can be elicited gradually by different types of artificial agents. The FFG's selective humanlikeness signal was not directly expressed in psychophysical ratings but could reflect a potential input signal for neural UV computations. \n\nTogether, these data identify an apparent progression of activity patterns that reflected the transition from a linear humanlikeness continuum in TPJ, to nonlinear humanlikeness signals in DMPFC and FFG and toward a nonlinear UV value function in VMPFC. The observed functional connectivities between these areas supported this information-processing sequence. Notably, these neural signals were recorded during UV-relevant evaluations and explained interindividual variation in UV reactions. \n\nSuch linear\u2013nonlinear transformations are known from hierarchical sensory systems that gradually, over a series of neural representations, produce selective responses to specific feature combinations ( ;  ). We found that a multiplicative combination of linear and nonlinear humanlikeness signals from TPJ and FFG was sufficient to approximate the observed neural UV representation in VMPFC. Multiplicative signal integration is biologically plausible and prevalent in sensory systems, where it produces nonlinear enhancement to specific feature combinations ( ;  ;  ;  ). Based on these data, we suggest that the UV reaction can be conceptualized as a nonlinear neural valuation response elicited by a specific feature combination\u2014high humanlikeness in nonhuman agents. This response likely derives from multiplicative integration of linear and nonlinear humanlikeness signals. \n\nAt the behavioral level, our data demonstrate how subjective UV reactions extend beyond perceptual impressions to active preference choices, guided by subjectively weighted decision attributes. To elicit UV reactions, we constructed artificial human stimuli from real human individuals that maximized humanlikeness but imposed unnatural, flawless and smoothed facial appearances and body proportions. The present neural and behavioral data suggest that this novel manipulation is particularly effective in eliciting a UV reaction, in accordance with recent suggestions ( ). Notably, previous behavioral studies typically reported strongest UV reactions for androids ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Here, inclusion of the highly humanlike artificial humans may have elicited adaptation effects that maximized UV reactions for artificial humans while attenuating UV reactions for androids. Such adaptive coding is well established in neural valuation systems, whereby neural responses adapt to the current statistical distribution of stimuli ( ;  ). Future studies could test systematically how the range of presented stimuli affects UV reactions in behavior and neural activity. \n\nOur results shed new light on the functions of different parts of medial prefrontal cortex that have been implicated in social and evaluative functions ( ). Previous studies reported involvement of DMPFC in evaluating traits of other people ( ;  ), modeling others' values and choices ( ;  ;  ), and understanding others' intentions ( ;  ). Despite these advances, the role of DMPFC in social cognition has remained elusive. Here we showed that DMPFC encoded a nonlinear humanlikeness signal that emphasized the distinction between human and nonhuman agents. This signal in DMPFC likely derived from TPJ's linear representation of the humanlikeness continuum and may have contributed to the nonlinear valuation function seen in VMPFC, as suggested by these areas' functional connections. VMPFC activity is consistently observed during value-based choice ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), including social choice ( ;  ;  ;  ). Our results advance understanding of VMPFC's functions by demonstrating how a nonlinear value function in VMPFC can be generated through multiplicative signal integration from other areas. \n\nThe amygdala is implicated in two functional domains that intersected in our study: the valuation of sensory events and the processing of social information ( ;  ;  ). Specifically, previous studies showed amygdala involvement in face processing ( ), trustworthiness evaluation ( ), anthropomorphizing ( ), and social impression formation ( ), which likely contributed to the observed amygdala activation in our decision task. Similar to VMPFC, amygdala encoding of subjects' decision variable is consistent with recent evidence implicating the amygdala in value-guided decisions ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Unlike VMPFC, amygdala coding of this decision variable reflected subjects' tendencies to reject gifts from artificial agents in the UV. Thus, the amygdala may distinctly contribute to inhibiting interactions with humanlike artificial agents. \n\nOur data suggest a novel, neurobiological conceptualization of human responses toward artificial social partners. In two experimental tasks, the VMPFC encoded an explicit representation of subjects' UV reactions as a nonlinear valuation function, by signaling selective low likability for the most humanlike artificial agents. This neural UV representation seemed to derive from a multiplicative combination of linear and nonlinear humanlikeness signals in functionally connected TPJ, FFG, and DMPFC. Thus, human reactions toward artificial agents involve a selective, nonlinear neural valuation in response to a specific feature combination (humanlikeness in nonhuman agents). These findings indicate that a basic sensory coding principle, enhanced neural feature selectivity through linear\u2013nonlinear transformation, may also apply to human valuations of social partners, as shown here for specific artificial agents. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1.\nEffect\tArea\tx\ty\tz\tz-score\tp\nHuman-likeness PM, positive\tTPJ\t56\t\u221260\t20\t3.53\t0.029\n\tDMPFC\t4\t40\t42\t3.14\t0.018 sv\nHuman-likeness PM, negative\tFFG\t26\t\u221266\t\u221212\t4.22\t0.001\n\tOccipital gyri\t\u221220\t\u2212102\t2\t5.54\t0.001\n\tMiddle frontal gyrus\t\u221248\t36\t24\t3.9\t0.001\nLikability PM, positive\tVMPFC\t12\t48\t8\t4.0\t0.001\n\tStriate area\t30\t\u221298\t18\t3.87\t0.002\n\tVentral striatum\t12\t12\t\u221210\t3.1\t0.043 sv\nLikability PM, negative\t\u2014\t\t\t\t\t\nFamiliarity PM, positive\tVentral striatum\t10\t14\t\u22124\t3.4\t0.025 sv\nFamiliarity PM, negative\t\u2014\t\t\t\t\t\n### Caption\nRating task analyses\n### Footer\nResults are whole-brain corrected, p < 0.05, cluster level;

When this correlation is done using the conventional univariate approach, for example with the general linear model, there is the usual problem of correcting the statistics for multiple comparisons. Cluster thresholding is often used as the correction of choice, though in many cases it is utilized in an   ad hoc   way, for example by employing the same cluster thresholds for both traditional regressors (stimulus or behaviorally derived) and EEG-derived regressors. In this paper we describe a resampling procedure that takes into account the   a priori   statistics of the trial-to-trial variability of the EEG-derived regressors in a way that trades off cluster size and maximum voxel   Z  -score to properly correct for multiple comparisons. We show that this data adaptive procedure improves sensitivity for smaller clusters of activation, without sacrificing the specificity of the results. Our results suggest that extra care is needed in correcting statistics when the regressor model is derived from noisy and/or uncertain measurements, as is the case for regressors constructed from single-trial variations in the EEG. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIt is becoming increasingly common to use single-trial EEG-derived values to model simultaneously acquired fMRI data. The combination of these two complementary neuroimaging modalities enables the variability of neural activity to be related to the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response (e.g., Debener et al.,  ; Benar et al.,  ; Goldman et al.,  ). Particularly exciting is that this type of fusion of modalities exploits variability that is not observable via behavioral responses, and thus provides a window into latent states of the human brain. \n\nMany efforts combining simultaneous EEG and fMRI in this way employ the general linear model (GLM; Worsley and Friston,  ). The GLM is a univariate approach which, when applied to massive datasets such as fMRI, requires correcting the statistics for multiple comparisons in order to properly perform hypothesis testing. The issue of multiple comparison correction has been addressed extensively in the literature and there are a number of procedures that have been adopted, both for fMRI analysis alone (Genovese et al.,  ; Nichols and Hayasaka,  ) and for simultaneous EEG/fMRI (Debener et al.,  ; Eichele et al.,  ; Benar et al.,  ; Esposito et al.,  ; Goldman et al.,  ; Mayhew et al.,  ; Mulert et al.,  ; Scheibe et al.,  ; Novitskiy et al.,  ). \n\nOne concern that is specific to using the variability of EEG-derived regressors is the added uncertainty in the \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the resulting statistics within the context of statistical parametric maps. This can be easily seen if we consider the sources of uncertainty for different types of regressors. In conventional fMRI, regressors might be constructed based on the timing of the stimulus presented to the subject (see Figure  A). We know the times exactly and we have reason to believe that these times are relevant to the activity in the brain. The amplitudes of the regressor events are constant so there is no uncertainty in terms of their magnitude \u2013 i.e., a constant scale would not change the GLM analysis. We could also construct regressors derived from behavioral measures, such as response time (RT), and though this may vary across trial and subject, we can measure RTs very accurately and thus measurement noise is low. However there is additional uncertainty in the interpretation of the amplitude variations. For example a long RT (e.g., high amplitude on a trial) might be caused by attentional lapses, natural alertness fluctuations, or additional neural processing for increasing decision confidence. Thus, compared to the case in Figure  A, the behavioral regressor in Figure  B could be seen as having greater uncertainty. \n  \n Sources of uncertainty in different regressor models  . Shown are three regressor types (before convolution with the hemodynamic response function).   (A)   Regressor constructed from the onset times of the stimulus. The high certainty in this type of regressor is a result of stimulus times being set by the experiment and measured exactly. There is no uncertainty in the interpretation of amplitudes since they are constant.   (B)   Regressor constructed by modulating the stimulus onset times by response times (RTs). Measurement noise of RTs is low (i.e., RTs are high SNR measurements) however there is additional uncertainty (relative to case   A  ) in terms of the interpretation of the trial-by-trial variations in response time.   (C)   Regressor constructed by modulating stimulus by activity derived from electrophysiological variability. Sources of uncertainty include both measurement noise, due to the low SNR of the signal, as well as the interpretation of the trial-to-trial electrophysiological variability. \n  \nWhen constructing regressors derived from EEG variability (Figure  C), we must consider a number of factors affecting our uncertainty. One is related to the noise in the measurements \u2013 i.e., EEG has roughly a \u221220\u2009dB signal to noise ratio (SNR; Parra et al.,  ). Thus we have measurement noise that is greater than for the cases seen in Figures  A,B. Secondly, there is the interpretation of the meaning of the EEG-derived variability. We might hypothesize that the variability relates to attentional modulation, workload, perceived error strength, etc., but this too is a hypothesis with its own noise/uncertainty \u2013 similar to the issue for the RT derived regressor of Figure  B. \n\nIn order to take the uncertainty in the prior into account, we could resample from the prior distribution to construct our null hypothesis (H0). There are many ways to resample or bootstrap (e.g., for a review of techniques in signal processing see (Zoubir and Iskander,  ). One of the simplest is to draw samples from a distribution of the noise by permuting or randomizing the EEG-derived variability. In previous work we used a simple resampling procedure to compute cluster thresholds for correcting for multiple comparisons (Goldman et al.,  ). However this method for estimating a cluster size threshold was limited because it sacrificed sensitivity for overly conservative specificity. Here we expand this work to a more exhaustive search of the parameter spaces by developing a better representation of the relationship between characteristics of the data. This enables us to maintain both sensitivity and specificity over a range of cluster sizes. \n\nWe present these results for two such characteristics: cluster size and maximum   z  -score within a cluster. We use the relationship between them to correct for multiple comparisons by trading-off   z  -score for cluster size. Specifically, we propose a resampling technique, adapted to the noise distribution of the single-trial EEG-derived regressors, that enables increased sensitivity by identifying significance values that are a joint function of cluster size and maximum   z  -score \u2013 i.e., enables us to construct the null hypothesis H0 and set a joint threshold to test significance. This approach increases sensitivity by allowing smaller clusters having higher   z  -score, while maintaining specificity. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nThe data used in this study are taken from Goldman et al. ( ). Detailed methods of subjects, paradigm, data acquisition, and single-trial analysis are given there (Goldman et al.,  ). In brief, simultaneous EEG and fMRI data were acquired for 11 healthy normal subjects (six female, mean age 31, range 25\u201338) during an auditory oddball paradigm. Informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the guidelines and approval of the Columbia University Institutional Review Board. \n\nSubjects listened to standard (frequency 350\u2009Hz, probability of occurrence 0.8) and oddball tones (frequency 500\u2009Hz, probability of occurrence 0.2). Subjects were instructed to respond with a button press to the target oddball tone. There were a total of 50 target and 200 standard trials for each subject. \n\nEEG was acquired simultaneously with fMRI using a custom-built MR-compatible system using 36 bipolar twisted pair electrodes sampled at 1\u2009kHz (Goldman et al.,  ; Sajda et al.,  ) in a 1.5-T scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, WA, USA). Whole brain functional EPI data were acquired with 15 axial slices (TE\u2009=\u200950\u2009ms; TR\u2009=\u20093000\u2009ms; matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964 voxels, 3.125\u2009mm in-plane resolution, 8\u2009mm thickness). EEG pre-processing included a 0.5-Hz high-pass filter, 60 and 120\u2009Hz notch filters, and gradient artifact removal (mean subtraction as well as 10\u2009ms median filter). BCG artifacts were removed by principal component analysis (PCA) by first estimating the principal components on data after high-pass filtering at 4\u2009Hz and then applying these estimates to the original EEG. The EEG data was epoched into trials in two ways: stimulus-locked (SL, aligned to the onset of the tone) and response-locked (RL, for the target tones, they were aligned to the subject's button press and for the standard tones they were randomly chosen from the RT distribution of the target tones). Individual subject single-trial analysis of EEG was then performed via logistic regression to discriminate between the EEG responses to two classes of stimuli (targets and standards) within consecutive 50\u2009ms training windows. The output of this process is a discriminating component,   y  , specific to that trial and discriminating window, where   y   represents the distance to the discriminating hyperplane (Parra et al.,  ;  ; Goldman et al.,  ). The amplitudes of the resulting discriminating components within the training window for each SL and RL window were then used to model the BOLD response on a single-trial basis. Figure   illustrates our approach, mapping from trial-to-trial variability in EEG components to fMRI regressors (in this case using time windows of 200 and 350\u2009ms post-stimulus). \n  \n Method used to construct fMRI regressors from EEG component trial-to-trial variability  .   Top  :   y  -values for all target trials of the single-trial EEG discriminator for two stimulus-locked windows. Data between black vertical bars indicates those   y  -values used in the analysis. In this example the window width is 50\u2009ms, with one window centered at 200\u2009ms and the other at 350\u2009ms post stimulus-onset. Hot to cold color scale indicates high likelihood to low likelihood for a target.   Middle  :   y  -value for a single target trial for each of the two components (black curves), showing the fMRI event model amplitude as the average of the discriminator output within each 50\u2009ms window, with one modulated event shown for 200\u2009ms (blue) and 350\u2009ms (red).   Bottom  : Single-trial fMRI regressor for target trials across the entire session for the 200 and 350\u2009ms windows, shown after convolution with the hemodynamic response function. Note that the event timing for each of the two windows is the same, but the event amplitudes are different. A separate fMRI analysis is run for each window, using that window's single-trial output to model single-trial variability. Figure from Goldman et al. ( ). \n  \n### Resampling \n  \nOur goal in the resampling was to maintain the overall distributions of the EEG discriminating components (  y  -values) for target and standard trials while removing the specific trial-to-trial correlations in the individual experimental runs. To this end, we constructed two empirical distributions (one for \u201ctarget   y  -values\u201d and one for \u201cstandard   y  -values\u201d) by pooling the   y  -values for each condition across all subjects and runs. To best demonstrate the contribution of the trial-to-trial variability, we constructed our empirical distributions using   y  -values from only behaviorally correct trials and computed from a time window (450\u2009ms SL) which yielded both substantial discrimination in the EEG (across subject, average Az\u2009>\u20090.75; Figure\u20092 in Goldman et al.,  ) as well as significant correlation in the fMRI (  p  \u2009<\u20090.005 and cluster corrected for comparison of <73 voxels; Figure   in Goldman et al.,  ). \n\nGiven these empirical distributions, we constructed a \u201cresampled run\u201d by taking the ordered vector of targets and standard trials (250 trials per subject, with 50 targets and 200 standards intermixed) and drew randomly, without replacement, from the distribution corresponding to the label of that trial. Thus for a resampled run, all trials were drawn from the distribution with the correct \u201clabel\u201d (target or standard) however the specific   y  -value was mixed between trials, runs and subjects. All subjects had the same resampled run   y  -values for a given iteration, though the resulting regressors for each subject were different given that the each had a random sequence of target and standard trials. This entire procedure was repeated 100 times, yielding 100 resamplings of the entire data set (run, subject, group). These procedures allowed us to construct the null hypothesis H0, and establish a joint threshold on cluster size and max   z  -score (see below). \n\n\n### fMRI analysis \n  \nFor each of the 100 resampled iterations, a full three-level analysis (run, subject, group) was performed. Standard fMRI pre-processing was performed: slice-timing correction, motion correction, spatial smoothing at 8\u2009mm full-width at half-maximum, and high-pass filtering at 0.01\u2009Hz. Our design matrix included 11 regressors, six of which related to the degrees of motion correction. Of the remaining five regressors (which were convolved with a double-gamma hemodynamic response function), two were a traditional event-related model of target and standard tones (onset at the time of stimulus presentation, duration 100\u2009ms, amplitude of 1), one represented the RTs (with onset at the time of stimulus presentation, duration 100\u2009ms, amplitude corresponding to RT), and the final two regressors modeled the amplitude variability of the single-trial discriminating component (onset time at window time, duration 100\u2009ms, amplitude given by the single-trial EEG discriminator   y  -value) and were orthogonalized to the traditional target and standard regressors. These single-trial regressors allowed us to examine the BOLD signal related to the variation in the resampled single-trial EEG discriminating component values. Specifically, we looked at the cluster outputs from the resampled single-trial target and standard regressors. \n\n\n### One-dimensional thresholds \n  \nAll clusters that exceeded minimal thresholds [cluster size of 2 and   z  -score of 2.57 (per voxel   p  \u2009=\u20090.005)] from all 100 iterations were assembled for both positive and negative correlations for the resampled single-trial targets. Two characteristics of the resampled data were obtained: cluster size (number of voxels) and   z  -score (maximum value in cluster). The resampled data were sorted and thresholds were established based on the top 5% and top 1%. Canonical thresholds were also used: 10 voxel cluster size and 2.57   z  -score. The results from the analysis of single-trial simultaneous EEG/fMRI from Goldman et al. ( ) were overlaid to examine those clusters that exceeded each of these thresholds. \n\n\n### Constructing joint thresholds \n  \nWe developed an approach for increasing the sensitivity for smaller cluster sizes by constructing a significance threshold based on the joint distribution of cluster size and maximum   z  -score. Our approach was to identify a joint distribution, based on these two measures, that showed a strong positive linear correlation which could be used to construct a one-dimensional projection for thresholding which was a function of both dimensions. We found that the log cluster size versus 1\u2009\u2212\u2009(maximum   p  -value in the cluster) resulted in a strong linear fit (Pearson's correlation coefficient   r  \u2009=\u20090.88) for all resampled clusters that exceeded the minimal thresholds [cluster size of 2 and   z  -score of 2.57 (per voxel   p  \u2009=\u20090.005)]. The projections of the resampled activations along this linear regression were sorted to obtain the maximal 5 and 1%. Significance thresholds (  p  \u2009=\u20090.05 and 0.01) were defined by orthogonal projections from this linear fit of the resampled activations. The results from the analysis of single-trial simultaneous EEG/fMRI from Goldman et al. ( ) were overlaid to examine those clusters that exceeded both of these thresholds. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Statistics \n  \nThere were 655 clusters with a per-voxel   p  \u2009<\u20090.005 that survived the minimum cluster threshold of two voxels in the resampled analysis. The mean cluster size was 14 voxels with a standard deviation of 18. The mean   z  -score within these clusters was 2.8 and the standard deviation was 0.14. The clusters from the resampled analysis were overlaid onto a standard MNI template brain volume to ensure that clusters of activation from resampling came from regions throughout the brain and did not represent the same cluster (data not shown). \n\n\n### Cluster size threshold \n  \nWe examined the distribution of cluster sizes (number of voxels) for the resampled data and used these data to establish adaptive thresholds. The largest 1% (  n  \u2009=\u20096 of 655) of the resampled data had a cluster size that exceeded 94 voxels. The largest 5% (  n  \u2009=\u200932 of 655) of the resampled data clusters had a cluster size that exceeded 50 voxels. These thresholds were then applied to the clusters observed in the original data, which represent regions where BOLD signal correlated with either SL or RL single-trial EEG variability. The relationship between the resampled and original data is depicted in Figure  . This figure indicates that there were only three clusters from the original data that exceeded the   p  \u2009<\u20090.01 resampled significance threshold of 94 voxels. Further, these three clusters were the only ones that exceeded the   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 resampled significance threshold of 50 voxels. Two of those activations were seen in the right lateral occipital cortex (Table  , clusters 1 and 2). One cluster was found in the left postcentral gyrus (Table  , cluster 3). Twenty-six percent (22 of 85) of the original clusters exceeded a canonical 10 voxel threshold. Thirty-seven percent (244 of 655) of the resampled clusters exceeded that canonical 10 voxel threshold. \n  \n The resampling method, used to generate the threshold based on cluster size  . The resampled data (blue) are sorted and plotted in increasing cluster size (number of voxels). Three significance thresholds are presented: 10 voxel canonical cluster threshold (black solid line),   p  \u2009=\u20090.05 resampled significance threshold (red solid line), and   p  \u2009=\u20090.01 resampled significance threshold (yellow solid line). Horizontal dashed lines show the cluster sizes of the original data from Goldman et al. ( ), both those below (green) and the three clusters that exceed (yellow) the resampled cluster size significance threshold (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01). \n    \n Significant clusters of activation in the original data of Goldman et al. ( )  . \n  \n Index is a number to uniquely identify the cluster for later reference. Cluster size is given in number of voxels. For the one-dimensional thresholds, the background color (yellow, p\u2009<\u20090.01; red, p\u2009<\u20090.05) indicates if the cluster was significant in the corresponding column. For the joint threshold, the background color in the 1\u2009\u2212\u2009p-value column indicates the significance. Cluster location is given by hemisphere (R, right; L, left), location of the peak z-score (x, y, z in MNI space), and brain region. Also shown for each cluster is the direction of correlation between single-trial regressor and BOLD signal (\u2212, +), Az value for the single-trial window, whether the window was locked to stimulus onset or response time, and the window onset time in milliseconds  . \n  \n\n### Max Z-score threshold \n  \nWe also plotted the distribution of maximum   z  -scores (the peak value within the clusters) for the resampled data and used these to establish adaptive thresholds. The upper 1% of the resampled data clusters had a   z  -score that exceeded 3.17, and the upper 5% had a   z  -score that exceeded 3.01. These thresholds were then applied to the   z  -scores from the original data. The relationship between the resampled and original data is depicted in Figure  . This figure indicates one cluster that exceeds the   p  \u2009<\u20090.01 resampled significance threshold of   z  \u2009=\u20093.17. This cluster was located in the right lateral occipital cortex (Table  , cluster 1). The figure also indicates three additional clusters that exceed the   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 resampled significance threshold   z  \u2009=\u20093.01. These clusters were located in the right lateral occipital cortex (Table  , cluster 2), and bilaterally in the amygdala (Table  , clusters 4 and 5). \n  \n The resampling method, used to generate thresholds based on the maximum   z  -score within the cluster  . The resampled data (in blue) are sorted and plotted in increasing   z  -score. Horizontal dashed lines of the   z  -scores of the original data are overlaid (in green). Three significance thresholds are shown:   z  \u2009=\u20092.57 threshold (black),   p  \u2009=\u20090.05 resampled significance threshold (red), and   p  \u2009=\u20090.01 resampled significance threshold (yellow). The dashed lines of the four clusters from the original data of Goldman et al. ( ), that exceed significance thresholds are colored accordingly: three for which   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (red) and one for which   p  \u2009<\u20090.01 (yellow). \n  \n\n### Joint thresholds \n  \nThe relationship between cluster size (log scale) and 1\u2009\u2212\u2009(  p  -value) for the resampled and original data is depicted in Figure  . The linear regression visualizes the first principal component of the resampled data (  n  \u2009=\u2009655). Significance values (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05 and <0.01) were determined by the projections to the regression line of the 32nd and 6th largest resampled data clusters along this first principal component. Significance thresholds, the orthogonal projections from regression line, intersected for   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 at a cluster size of 52 and a 1\u2009\u2212\u2009  p  -value of 0.998 [  x  \u2009=\u2009(52,0.998)] and for   p  \u2009<\u20090.01 at a cluster size of 88 and a 1\u2009\u2212\u2009  p  -value of 0.999 [  x  \u2009=\u2009(88,0.999)]. Two clusters from the original data exceeded   p  \u2009<\u20090.01 significance (clusters 1 and 2) and three additional clusters exceeded   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 significance (clusters 3, 4, and 5). \n  \n Joint thresholds of cluster size (log scale) versus   p  -value (maximum of cluster) from resampling methods  . Shown are scatter plots of cluster size versus   p  -value of the resampled data (blue open circles) and the original data of Goldman et al. ( ; green filled circles). Two joint significance thresholds are shown:   p  \u2009=\u20090.05 resampled significance threshold (red), and   p  \u2009=\u20090.01 resampled significance threshold (yellow). Those clusters from the original data that exceed the joint significance thresholds are colored accordingly. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nSimultaneously acquired EEG and fMRI data offers the potential to investigate neural states with temporal and spatial precision that is not afforded by either method alone. However, while in traditional event-related fMRI the model is known with high certainty, explanatory variables defined by a measured quantity such as EEG introduce more uncertainty into the model. While it is becoming increasingly common to acquire multi-modal data, as yet there is no generally agreed upon method for analysis or interpretation of this data that takes the uncertainty of the model into account. \n\nIn this study, we used the data from Goldman et al. ( ), in which the single-trial variability derived from the EEG was used to construct BOLD fMRI regressors, to illustrate a resampling method for determining significance in single-trial EEG/fMRI data. With this method, we can correct for multiple comparisons by adaptively resampling the noise distribution of the EEG-derived regressors. This resampling method demonstrated an interaction between activated cluster size and local maximum   z  -score and showed that the joint distribution of the size of activation clusters and the maximum   z  -score found in the cluster can be used to establish significance thresholds that provide a proper trade-off of sensitivity and specificity. Principled methods for trading-off spatial extent and individual voxel statistical significance were originally proposed for use in neuroimaging by Poline et al. ( ). \n\nFigure   graphically summarizes the results from Table   and also illustrates the improved sensitivity we obtained using the joint threshold method. Compared to the results in Goldman et al. ( ), these results show additional significant correlations in areas that overlap with the amygdala. Though this current paper is meant as a statistical methods paper and is not aimed at re-evaluating the specific findings of Goldman et al. ( ), it is worth noting that the responses in the amygdala have been observed, intracranially, for activity associated with P300 timing and polarity (Halgren et al.,  ). \n  \n Significant clusters (yellow,   p  \u2009<\u20090. 01; red,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05) overlaid on axial slices of an MNI template brain image  . Each row corresponds to a different thresholding technique derived from our resampling tests:   (A)   cluster size only based threshold,   (B)   maximum   z  -score based threshold,   (C)   joint threshold. Sampled slices not shown (slices sampled every 6\u2009mm) had no significant clusters for any of the thresholding techniques. See Table   for additional information on these clusters. \n  \nProjection of the data onto the first principal component of this distribution allows us to simply compute a joint threshold for a one-sided significance level. One might ask \u201cwhy not use the full distribution instead of the projection on the first principle component?\u201d For example, one might imagine trying to empirically construct a one-sided multivariate test of significance by constructing contours of fixed probability mass about the mean and then utilize the contour cutoff so that an increase in single-voxel significance always yields a decrease in voxel size, and vice versa. Though such a procedure seems to be even more powerful than simply looking at the one-dimensional projection, it comes with the following disadvantages/costs. First it requires a parametric representation of the joint distribution so as to determine the shape of the contours and secondly it requires substantially more resampling to identify the contour/boundary and/or fit the parametric distributions if modeling the data. Since the distribution in Figure   does not appear to be well-modeled by a multivariate normal, we chose to illustrate our procedure with the simplest method which maintains the key points and findings of the approach. \n\nOur focus has been on a data adaptive approach to correct for multiple comparisons in the joint space of single-voxel   p  -value and cluster size. Cluster size thresholding has been a popular method for correcting for multiple comparisons in EEG/fMRI, but often these thresholds are selected   ad hoc   and then propagate in the literature, used by others with little statistical justification (e.g., see Scheibe et al.,  ). There are of course other data adaptive approaches that can be used to correct for multiple comparisons and are not based on using cluster-size. One of the more recently adopted techniques controls the false-discovery rate (FDR; Genovese et al.,  ; Nichols and Hayasaka,  ), namely the expected ratio of false positives to true positives. The FDR is data adaptive in that the thresholds are inherently linked to the signal to noise in the data. FDR correction methods are easily interpretable and are computationally efficient, compared to the resampling procedure we describe here. However, FDR usually does not take into account any prior model or certainty about the regressor model and requires some assumptions about the structure of the noise distribution. FDR correction methods are none-the-less an attractive approach for multiple comparison correction and more work is needed to understand how they can best be employed in EEG/fMRI data analysis. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, our results suggest that additional care is required when using cluster-size to correct for multiple comparisons and determine significance in EEG/fMRI data. Some groups use conservative thresholds (Goldman et al.,  ) while others use cutoffs that are more lenient (Debener et al.,  ; Benar et al.,  ; Mayhew et al.,  ; Scheibe et al.,  ). Conservative cluster thresholds reduce false positives, but they also limit the sensitivity of single-trial analysis. The resampling method proposed here suggests that standard   ad hoc   cluster size thresholds, for example of 10 voxels, are too lenient (at least in this case) since more than a third of the resampled data clusters were found to have a larger size. For this data, a more conservative threshold of 50 voxels, as determined by the variability in the data itself, is a better estimate of the true data significance. This is less conservative than the threshold (of 73) presented in Goldman et al. ( ) that was derived from a less expansive bootstrapping method. In any case, our results suggest that establishing statistical significance using a threshold criteria that has been used in another EEG/fMRI study may not be adequate. Instead these corrections are better off left to be data adaptive, and though this can be computationally expensive, it improves interpretation of the results and properly establishes statistical significance. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nIndex\tCluster size\tz-score\t1\u2009-\u2009(p-value) (joint threshold)\tHemisphere\tLocation (MNI)\tLocation (MNI)\tLocation (MNI)\tBrain region\tEEG single-trial logistic regression results\tEEG single-trial logistic regression results\tEEG single-trial logistic regression results\tEEG single-trial logistic regression results\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tUnnamed: 1_level_1\tUnnamed: 2_level_1\tUnnamed: 3_level_1\tUnnamed: 4_level_1\tx\ty\tz\tUnnamed: 8_level_1\tCorrelation\tAz\tLocked to\tWindow\n1\t203\t3.42\t0.9997\tR\t40\t\u221274\t\u22128\tLateral occipital cortex\t\u2013\t0.92\tResponse\t50\n2\t108\t3.04\t0.9988\tR\t42\t\u221268\t\u22124\tLateral occipital cortex\t\u2013\t0.86\tResponse\t150\n3\t101\t3.01\t0.9987\tL\t\u221228\t\u221236\t60\tPostcentral gyrus\t\u2013\t0.76\tStimulus\t450\n4\t46\t3.17\t0.9992\tR\t12\t\u22124\t\u221218\tAmygdala\t+\t0.83\tResponse\t200\n5\t44\t3.14\t0.9992\tL\t\u221232\t2\t\u221218\tAmygdala\t\u2013\t0.79\tResponse\t\u2212100\n### Caption\nSignificant clusters of activation in the original data of Goldman et al.

Mental workload also elicited an increase in heart rate and pupil diameter. Task performance did not decrease under the threat of stressors, most likely due to efficient inhibition of auditory regions, as reflected by a large decrement of activity in the superior temporal gyri. The threat of stressors was also accompanied with deactivations of limbic regions of the salience network (SN), possibly reflecting emotional regulation mechanisms through control from dorsal medial prefrontal and parietal regions, as indicated by functional connectivity analyses. Meanwhile, the threat of stressors induced enhanced ECN activity, likely for improved attentional and cognitive processes toward the task, as suggested by increased lateral prefrontal and parietal activations. These fMRI results suggest that measuring the balance between ECN, SN, and DMN recruitment could be used for objective mental state assessment. In this sense, an extra recruitment of task\u2010related regions and a high ratio of lateral versus medial prefrontal activity may represent a relevant marker of increased but efficient mental effort, while the opposite may indicate a disengagement from the task due to mental overload and/or stressors. \n  \nWe highlighted patterns of brain activations and autonomic activity when confronted with high mental workload and auditory stressors.

Complex and safety\u2010critical activities, such as piloting an airplane or operating a nuclear power plant, can lead to a drastic and simultaneous increase of both mental workload and acute stress. These effects originate from a combination of task complexity (Borghini, Astolfi, Vecchiato, Mattia, & Babiloni,\u00a0 ; Causse, Chua, Peysakhovich, Del Campo, & Matton,\u00a0 ; Durantin, Gagnon, Tremblay, & Dehais,\u00a0 ) and the potentially fatal consequence of errors (Kilic & Ucler,\u00a0 ). In this context, the maintenance of optimal cognitive performance is a constant challenge. According to several authors, high mental workload (Causse, Peysakhovich, & Fabre,\u00a0 ) and acute stress (Arnsten,\u00a0 ; Qin, Hermans, Marle, Luo, & Fern\u00e1ndez,\u00a0 ; Schoofs, Wolf, & Smeets,\u00a0 ; Starcke, Wiesen, Trotzke, & Brand,\u00a0 ) may both result in transient cognitive deficits, that is, impairments in executive functions and working memory (WM) in particular. Meanwhile, cerebral compensatory processes may be engaged and contribute to preserving cognitive performance (Fairclough & Mulder,\u00a0 ). A primary objective for improving safety in these critical situations is therefore a better understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms involved in either maintenance or deterioration of cognitive performance under challenging conditions. \n\nEnhanced task complexity can result in an increase of mental effort, corresponding to the amount of brain resources/cognitive capacity an individual puts into a task (Galy, Cariou, & M\u00e9lan,\u00a0 ), which might be indexed via brain activity or autonomic parameters (e.g., level of brain activity and pupil size). Task complexity also likely leads to greater mental workload, often inferred from overt behavior or performance. Mental workload roughly corresponds to the interplay between the demands of the environment (input load), human individual characteristics (capacities) and task performance (output) (Causse et al.,\u00a0 ). A decrease in cognitive task performance will occur whenever there is a mismatch between environmental demands and individual capabilities, that is, if the workload is too high or too low (Kantowitz & Casper,\u00a0 ). Thus, taking into account solely the task characteristics does now allow inferring the level of mental workload in an individual. \n\nIn the scientific literature, mental workload and stress are often designated indistinctively with terms like \u201cmental stress\u201d (Hjortskov et al.,\u00a0 ), probably because their causes and effects can be similar. Also, their occurrence can be concomitant: a task generating an important mental workload can lead to an increase in mental stress because the individual will be overwhelmed by the difficulty (Warm, Parasuraman, & Matthews,\u00a0 ) or will feel the situation as emotionally challenging. However, mental workload and stress may reasonably be considered as distinct phenomena (Hidalgo\u2010Mu\u00f1oz et al.,\u00a0 ). According to Gaillard\u00a0( ), it is possible to work quite hard on difficult and complex tasks, even under unfavorable conditions, without cognitive strain or adverse physiological effects. High task demands can be met by mobilizing extra cognitive resources. In contrast, mental stress is regarded by Gaillard as a state, in which cognitive resources allocation is inefficient and disturbed by negative emotions. In other words, a high level of mental workload does not necessarily elicit a high stress level, and a high stress level may also occur when mental workload is low. Altogether, these results underline the difficulty to disentangle cognitively\u2010demanding from acute stress situations, as well as the importance of determining physiological mechanisms supporting both these situations and their possible co\u2010occurrence. \n\nComplex physiological and brain mechanisms take place with both high mental workload and acute stress. The executive control network (ECN) is of particular importance regarding cognitive load management. The ECN comprises the lateral and medial parts of the dorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC), premotor regions and the lateral posterior parietal cortex. Its role is crucial for sustained and selective attention, cognitive flexibility, WM, and decision making in goal\u2010directed behaviors (Corbetta & Shulman,\u00a0 ). During effortful tasks, increased demands on executive functions and WM enhance activity in the fronto\u2010parietal network of the ECN and in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Ayaz et al.,\u00a0 ; Dosenbach, Fair, Cohen, Schlaggar, & Petersen,\u00a0 ; Engstr\u00f6m, Karlsson, Landtblom, & Craig,\u00a0 ; Khachouf, Chen, Duzzi, Porro, & Pagnoni,\u00a0 ; Mulert et al.,\u00a0 ; Owen, McMillan, Laird, & Bullmore,\u00a0 ; Power & Petersen,\u00a0 ; Schmidt et al.,\u00a0 ; Shenhav, Botvinick, & Cohen,\u00a0 ; Shenhav et al.,\u00a0 ). In particular, dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) activity increases linearly with WM load (Braver et al.,\u00a0 ), suggesting that the DLPFC region of the ECN represents a reliable proxy measure of mental workload (Mandrick, Peysakhovich, R\u00e9my, Lepron, & Causse,\u00a0 ; Parent, Peysakhovich, Mandrick, Tremblay, & Causse,\u00a0 ). A study of Shen et al.\u00a0( ) showed that connection strength between regions of the ECN is strongly correlated with executive function performance. High mental workload does not only elicit enhanced activity in the ECN: several brain regions can show reduced activity during the performance of demanding tasks, including the medial prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex, and the precuneus. This set of regions belong to the default mode network (DMN) (Fransson & Marrelec,\u00a0 ; Greicius, Krasnow, Reiss, & Menon,\u00a0 ; Raichle et al.,\u00a0 ; Ward et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nECN activity is influenced not only by mental workload but also by acute stress (Arnsten, Wang, & Paspalas,\u00a0 ; Hermans, Henckens, Jo\u00ebls, & Fern\u00e1ndez,\u00a0 ; Van Oort et al.,\u00a0 ). Depending on its level, stress may either improve or deteriorate the ECN function. Moderate levels of stress may induce a more efficient PFC function (Arnsten,\u00a0 ; Yuen et al.,\u00a0 ), while a highly stressful condition would induce an impaired PFC function (Arnsten et al.,\u00a0 ). Other large brain networks seem to be sensitive to increased stress levels. During episodes of high levels of stress, engagement of the amygdala and related limbic structures has been reported, with significant activity in the anterior insula, the dorsal ACC, the hippocampus, and the hypothalamus (Hermans et al.,\u00a0 ; Van Oort et al.,\u00a0 ). This set of regions has been described as the salience network (SN). Involvement of the SN may sustain the orientation of attention toward salient information to promote threat detection. Accordingly, SN activity decreases under low or moderate levels of stress (Pruessner et al.,\u00a0 ), while predominant involvement of the SN is observed under highly stressful situations. \n\nFew imaging studies have investigated the combined effects of cognitive workload and stressors. Under stress, activity in lateral PFC regions of the ECN implied in the cognitive task either increases (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Porcelli et al.,\u00a0 ), remains unchanged (Cousijn, Rijpkema, Qin, van Wingen, & Fern\u00e1ndez,\u00a0 ) or decreases (Qin et al.,\u00a0 ). Accordingly, the PFC could have a critical role in mediating stress influence on cognition (Bogdanov & Schwabe,\u00a0 ; Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Porcelli et al.,\u00a0 ; Shields, Sazma, & Yonelinas,\u00a0 ). Moreover, when acute stress and high cognitive load are combined, a dynamic interplay between ECN, DMN, and SN, possibly driven by the dorsal ACC and the ventral lateral PFC (VLPFC) (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Pruessner et al.,\u00a0 ; Simpson, Snyder, Gusnard, & Raichle,\u00a0 ), may enable the reallocation of neural resources. A shift toward the SN and DMN would reduce cognitive efficiency (Qin et al.,\u00a0 ) and enhance environment scanning at the cost of cognitive performance ensured by the ECN. Conversely, a shift toward the ECN, along with top\u2010down inhibition of the SN and DMN, may enable preservation of cognitive performance under stress. In previous studies, mental workload was elicited with WM tests such as two\u2010back letter or digit tasks. These tasks were combined with acute stress induced by an aversive movie (Cousijn et al.,\u00a0 ; Qin et al.,\u00a0 ), the threat of shock (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ), or the cold pressor test (Duncko, Johnson, Merikangas, & Grillon,\u00a0 ; Porcelli et al.,\u00a0 ). In these studies, high\u2010load WM task accuracy was preserved under stress. Preservation of WM performance may pertain to the relatively moderate perceived workload and the involvement of emotion regulation mechanisms. Conversely, other studies have reported reduced performance following exposure to stressors, either psychosocial (Jiang & Rau,\u00a0 ; Schoofs, Preu\u00df, & Wolf,\u00a0 ) or physical (cold pressor test) (Schoofs et al.,\u00a0 ). Hence, there is no clear pattern for the influence of stress on cognition, this influence being likely dependent on the height of the cognitive load and the level and nature of stress. In particular, it still remains unclear whether performance on a more demanding cognitive task, relying on the ECN and efficient PFC function, could be maintained under stressors (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Porcelli et al.,\u00a0 ; Schoofs et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nIn the present fMRI study, we investigated performance and brain activity during a highly difficult task performed under varying levels of task difficulty and the threat of stressors. We introduced a paradigm that reproduces the mentally challenging conditions that operators face during degraded contexts. To achieve this aim, we used the novel Toulouse n\u2010bask task (TNT) that combines a classical n\u2010back task with mental arithmetic. The n\u2010back WM paradigms were consistently shown to imply bilateral DLPFC and dorsal lateral parietal regions. Mental calculation involves a large\u2010scale network, including lateral and medial prefrontal and motor regions, as well as inferior and superior parietal cortex (Gruber, Indefrey, Steinmetz, & Kleinschmidt,\u00a0 ; Klein, Moeller, Glauche, Weiller, & Willmes,\u00a0 ; Kong et al.,\u00a0 ). By combining n\u2010back WM and mental arithmetic processes, the TNT task was thus thought to rely heavily on an extended fronto\u2010parietal network encompassing the ECN, and was conceived to mimic the multidimensional high mental workload existing in many safety\u2010critical occupations such as aircraft piloting (Mandrick et al.,\u00a0 ). In addition, this novel n\u2010back task was completely embedded into a threatening or safe context. The threatening context was induced using frequent but unexpected occurrences of aversive auditory stimuli played in parallel with the task. This induction method is potentially more efficient than the use of a punctual emotional induction delivered before the task, whose effects can fade out progressively, for example, when using an emotional movie clip before task execution (Cousijn et al.,\u00a0 ; Du et al.,\u00a0 ; Jiang & Rau,\u00a0 ; Qin et al.,\u00a0 ). Also, previous research using physical stressors during task performance may have been confounded by distraction effects due to the salience of the stimulus (Duncko et al.,\u00a0 ; Porcelli et al.,\u00a0 ; Schoofs et al.,\u00a0 ). In this study, we were interested in the experienced stress per se, we thus excluded the time period during which the aversive stimuli were delivered, focusing on the effects of the threat of unpredictable loud unpleasant sounds. Another important aspect of the experimental paradigm was the manipulation of both task difficulty and the presence of stressors while measuring pupil diameter and cardiac activity, both being particularly sensitive to mental effort (Eysenck & Calvo,\u00a0 ; Fairclough & Houston,\u00a0 ; Gray & Braver,\u00a0 ; Peysakhovich, Causse, Scannella, & Dehais,\u00a0 ) and stress (DeBeck, Petersen, Jones, & Stickland,\u00a0 ; Yao et al.,\u00a0 ). Such physiological recordings are feasible in situ, for example, in cockpits during flight. Thus concurrent neuroimaging and physiological measures during variable mental load and stress conditions are particularly relevant (Aln\u00e6s et al.,\u00a0 ; Brown et al.,\u00a0 ; Khachouf et al.,\u00a0 ; Mandrick et al.,\u00a0 ; Parent et al.,\u00a0 ; Wang et al.,\u00a0 ). We thus investigated how brain activity co\u2010varied with these two physiological measurements thanks to parametric modulation analyses. \n\nWe hypothesized that cognitive performance would deteriorate under high workload and we expected greater involvement of the ECN regions, particularly the DLPFC and the lateral parietal cortex, and deactivations of the DMN, altogether suggesting increased mental workload due to the challenging task. Both heart rate and pupil diameter should be increased. We also expected that performance should be relatively preserved under stress induction thanks to emotional regulation. However we expected that the combination of high task difficulty and stress induction may lead to an overload of the ECN. A marked decrease of task performance and an opposite brain pattern of activations to those observed under the high workload should be observed, with a decrease in the ECN regions along with SN activations. Heart rate and pupil diameter might be either increased or decreased since a disengaging of the task may occur, generating a decline of the sympathetic activity, while the stress could, on the contrary, increase sympathetic activity. \n\n\n## METHODS AND MATERIALS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty young, healthy participants (6 females, 14 males; mean age\u00a0=\u00a024\u2009years,   SD   =\u20093.9\u2009years and range\u00a0=\u00a020\u201334) were involved in this study. All had studied for at least 2\u2009years at university (after completion of their secondary education). Four participants were left\u2010handed, while the others were right\u2010handed. The hand dominance did not affect behavioral performance reported in this study. None reported either affective or anxiety disorders or any neurological or cardiovascular disease. None were under any form of medication that might affect the brain or autonomic functions. All participants reported normal auditory acuity and normal or corrected\u2010to\u2010normal vision. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki for human experimentation and was approved by a National Ethics Board (CPP du Sud\u2010Ouest et Outre\u2010Mer IV, no. CPP15\u2010010b/2015\u2010A00458\u201041). All participants signed a consent form and were paid for their participation. They were informed that they would be submitted to unpleasant loud sounds in the MRI scanner. \n\n\n### Stress induction \n  \nStress (sustained anxiety) induction was performed with the threat of unpredictable loud unpleasant sounds, such as blackboard scratching, plate scratching with a fork, dentist's drill, and so on (Patel et al.,\u00a0 ). Thirty\u2010four sounds were selected based on previous works (Grillon et al.,\u00a0 ; Hirano et al.,\u00a0 ; Kumar, Forster, Bailey, & Griffiths,\u00a0 ; Zald, Hagen, & Pardo,\u00a0 ) and on a survey that we conducted on a separate group of 87 participants. According to our survey, the sounds were globally perceived as mildly stressful, uncomfortable, and unpleasant. \n\nDuring the training session of the present experiment, participants were first asked to estimate the maximum acceptable sound level they could bear (ranging from 80 to 95\u2009dB). This maximum acceptable sound level was later set in the fMRI. They were then exposed to the 34 different sounds. Each participant evaluated these sounds (7\u2010s duration each) by rating them on a scale from 0 (not aversive) to 10 (highly aversive). Based on the individual ratings, the 17 most unpleasant sounds were selected for each participant to be further presented during the MRI session. The 17 sounds played during the experiment were rated at 7.42 on average across all the participants. Following this, participants were trained to associate \u201csafe\u201d (no aversive sounds) and \u201cthreat\u201d (aversive sounds) conditions with colored screens, that is, blue screen and red screen, respectively. During the safe condition, participants had nothing to do except quietly watching the blue colored screen. During the threat condition, participants had to pay attention to several unpleasant loud sounds while watching the red screen. \n\nIn the MRI scanner, participants were informed that they would be exposed to unpredictable aversive loud sounds, among those they rated as the most unpleasant, during either active or rest blocks. The onset of sounds was unknown to participants in order to maintain a continuous threat (Grillon et al.,\u00a0 ; Zald & Pardo,\u00a0 ). The aversive sounds occurred randomly during all cognitive tasks and rest conditions and were noncontingent upon the performance of the participant to the task. Each of the 17 aversive sounds was presented once to the participant to prevent habituation. They could be played one time or two consecutive times (without pause between the two occurrences), and never occurred again later in the experiment. The sounds were played via MR\u2010compatible monitor headphones in stereo mode. \n\n\n### n\u2010back task \n  \nThe Toulouse n\u2010back Task (TNT) was implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks) using the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions (Brainard,\u00a0 ; Kleiner, Brainard, & Pelli,\u00a0 ; Pelli & Vision,\u00a0 ). The task is described in detail in a previous publication (Mandrick et al.,\u00a0 ). The task was developed to combine a classical n\u2010back task with mental arithmetic. Instead of memorizing and comparing unique items, as in the classical n\u2010back task, the participants had to memorize and to compare the results of arithmetic operations, computed beforehand. Arithmetic operations were either additions or subtractions. All numbers were multiples of five (e.g., 15\u2009+\u200940, 90\u201335). The arithmetic operations (trials) were presented for 2.5\u00a0s, followed by an interstimulus\u2010interval of 0.5\u00a0s. Volunteers were required to compute the result of the arithmetic operations and compare it with either a fixed number (0\u2010back) or the result obtained two trials before (2\u2010back). In the 0\u2010back condition, the \u201ctarget\u201d fixed number was \u201c50.\u201d Participants were therefore asked to press a specific button when the result of the operation was 50. In the 2\u2010back condition, the participants were asked to press the button whenever the result of the arithmetic operation was identical to the one presented two trials ago (\u201cmatch\u201d), see Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nExperimental design. (a) Toulouse n\u2010back task (TNT). The active blocks consisted of 12 trials and lasted 36\u00a0s. They were interleaved with 24\u2010s rest blocks (R). Participants responded to targets and nontargets by pressing one of two different buttons. The side of the buttons was counterbalanced across participants. (b) experimental timeline. The experiment included five functional runs (two safe runs without any sounds and three threat runs with the possible occurrence of aversive sounds), presented in a counterbalanced order. TNT difficulty levels (0\u2010back and 2\u2010back) were counterbalanced and alternated with rest periods. Unpredictable aversive loud sounds were presented randomly during threat runs and could occur during rest and active blocks \n  \n\n### Procedure \n  \nThe entire protocol lasted approximately 3\u00a0hr. Before scanning, participants performed the training session, during which they were exposed to the auditory stressors further used in the MRI. They were also trained on the TNT for the two levels of task difficulty, that is, 0\u2010back and 2\u2010back. This cognitive training included at least one block for the 0\u2010back condition and three blocks for the 2\u2010back condition, until participants felt comfortable with the TNT. Furthermore, the training was successively performed in both the safe and the threat conditions. In the MRI, the TNT was presented using a video projector on a translucent screen placed above the head of the participant. He or she viewed the stimuli through a mirror mounted on the head coil above their eyes. Head movement was restricted using foam cushions. All participants underwent five functional runs (apart from two participants, who performed only four runs due to technical problems). The five functional runs consisted of two safe runs and three threat runs with the possible occurrence of aversive sounds, see Figure\u00a0 . We chose to design a within\u2010subject study (all the participants underwent safe and aversive conditions with concomitant n\u2010back task). Indeed, we expected rather large intersubject variability in cognitive performance on the complex n\u2010back calculation task (Mandrick et al.,\u00a0 ). Therefore, comparing TNT performance in two groups of participants with a between\u2010subject design may have confounded our results regarding stress effects on cognition. Moreover, similar studies have been previously conducted with no visible effect of stress persistence across stressful and safe alternate sessions (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Cousijn et al.,\u00a0 ). The order of the safe and threat runs was counterbalanced across participants. Half of the participants started each run with the 0\u2010back level and the other half with the 2\u2010back level. The TNT was presented with a blocked design. Each functional run included 12\u2009cycles of alternating 0\u2010back and 2\u2010back 36\u2010s active blocks interleaved by 24\u2010s rest blocks. Within each active block, a series of 12 arithmetic operations (trials) were presented to the participant. The participant was given a 2\u2010button response box (one button for \u201ctarget,\u201d the other for \u201cno target\u201d) and was asked to respond as quickly as possible. Each active block contained four targets in random positions. Active blocks were preceded by an instruction cue lasting 6\u00a0s. The instruction cue informed the participant about the next n\u2010back level (0\u2010back or 2\u2010back) and the screen color background indicated whether it will be a safe (blue screen) or a threat (red screen) condition. The color was not visible during the active blocks, arithmetic operations were displayed in the center of a gray background. During the rest blocks, \u201c00 + 00\u201d operations were presented and the participant did not give any response. The MRI scanning session lasted about 1\u00a0hr and 15\u2009min. \n\n\n###  MRI   data acquisition \n  \nMRI data were acquired on a Philips Achieva 3\u2010T scanner (Philips, Best, The Netherlands) at the Toulouse Neuroimaging Center technical platform (referred to as ToNIC Inserm UMR 1214), using a 32\u2010element SENSE head coil. Each of the five functional runs included successive acquisitions of 285 whole\u2010brain T2*\u2010weighted echo planar images with blood oxygenation level\u2010dependent contrast (EPI\u2010BOLD) sequence [40 axial slices with ascending acquisition order, repetition time (TR)\u00a0=\u00a02.60\u00a0s, echo time (TE)\u00a0=\u00a030\u2009ms, 90\u00b0 flip angle, matrix size\u00a0=\u00a096\u2009\u00d7\u200996, slice\u2010thickness\u00a0=\u00a03\u2009mm with no slice gap, field of view (FOV) 240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009mm ]. In addition to the five functional runs, each participant also underwent a high\u2010resolution 3D anatomical scan for functional overlay and stereotaxic transformation. This scan was acquired using a T1\u2010weighted 3D magnetization\u2010prepared rapid gradient\u2010echo (MP\u2010RAGE) sequence (TR\u00a0=\u00a08.1\u00a0ms, TE\u00a0=\u00a03.7\u00a0ms, 8\u00b0 flip\u2010angle, 170 contiguous sagittal slices with matrix size 240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240, FOV 240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009170\u2009mm ). \n\n\n### Autonomic nervous system measures in the   MRI  \n  \nFor heart rate measures, the ECG signal was recorded continuously at 500\u2009Hz throughout MRI scanning with an MR\u2010compatible pulse oximeter (Philips, Best, The Netherlands) attached to the left index finger. Moreover, the pupil diameter of the left eye was recorded continuously with an MR\u2010compatible eye\u2010tracking device (long\u2010range optic ASL EyeTracker 6000, Applied Science Laboratories, Bedford, Massachusetts) at a sampling rate of 60\u2009Hz. The eye\u2010tracker was positioned behind the scanner and the translucent screen. A hole with a radius of 3\u00a0cm was made at the bottom of the screen so that the camera could monitor the subject's eye on the mirror and the infrared light emitter could illuminate the pupil to assess its size. \n\n\n### Subjective ratings of task difficulty and anxiety \n  \nA debriefing session was conducted after MRI scanning. Participants were asked to rate the difficulty of the TNT task and the level of anxiety induced by task difficulty and by the threat of the aversive sounds. The rating was done on a 0\u201310 scale. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Behavioral data \n  \nThe mean percentage of correctly reported match/no\u2010match response (corresponding to performance success) and the mean reaction times were calculated for each participant and in each of the four experimental conditions. In addition, d\u2010prime was calculated as   z  (hit rate)\u2009\u2212\u2009  z  (false alarm rate). The three variables were analyzed across participants using repeated\u2010measures 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 ANOVA with factors of cognitive load (0\u2010back, 2\u2010back) and threatening context (safe, threat). \n\n\n#### Autonomic nervous system measure analysis \n  \n##### Heart rate \n  \nECG signal was first visually controlled for outliers and artifacts. Signal was processed with the \u201cfindpeaks\u201d function of MATLAB 2019. The series of R\u2013R interval times were then derived from the ECG and the mean heart rate was calculated for each active 36\u00a0s block. Hear rate was then averaged for each of the four experimental conditions. These mean values were further used as parametric modulators in fMRI first\u2010level models (see below). \n\n\n##### Pupil diameter \n  \nPupil diameter signal was processed using home\u2010made MATLAB scripts. Periods of signal loss and blinking as well as six samples before and after each signal loss period (100\u2009ms at 60\u2009Hz) were linearly interpolated. Trials where the number of interpolated samples exceeded 50%, were excluded from analyses. The signal was low\u2010passed using a 9\u2010point moving average filter. The pupil diameter was then averaged over all trials of each active 36\u2010s block, and then averaged for each of the four experimental conditions. Therefore, the mean pupil diameter values were modulated by both tonic and phasic pupil changes induced by cognitive load and/or threatening context. These mean values were further used as parametric modulators in fMRI first\u2010level models (see below). \n\n\n\n####  MRI   data preprocessing \n  \nImage preprocessing and statistical analysis were performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8) ( ). Functional images were realigned to the first volume with a six\u2010parameter rigid\u2010body transformation and the mean functional image was co\u2010registered to participant's T1\u2010weighted MR image. Functional images were corrected for slice acquisition timing. Anatomical images were then segmented based on tissue probability maps of gray matter, white matter and CSF in the standard MNI space. The deformation field used for the segmentation was applied to the T1\u2010weighted and functional images for normalization into MNI stereotactic space. Functional images were resampled into 2\u2010mm isotropic voxels. Finally, functional images were spatially smoothed by convolving with an isotropic 3D\u2010Gaussian kernel (8\u2010mm full width at half maximum). \n\n\n####  MRI   data statistical analyses \n  \n##### First\u2010level analyses \n  \nFor each participant, six experimental conditions were implemented as box\u2010car functions with an epoch length of 36\u00a0s, convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Specifically, individual models included four regressors of interest (corresponding to 0\u2010back safe, 2\u2010back safe, 0\u2010back threat, and 2\u2010back threat epochs) and two regressors of no interest corresponding to the 0\u2010back and 2\u2010back task epochs, during which aversive sounds were presented. These two latter conditions of no interest (12 blocks in total) were modeled to exclude any auditory perception effect or any potential distraction effect of sound, and to selectively tackle the effect of stress related to the expectancy of the unpredictable sounds. Rest epochs were implicitly modeled. In this first model, simple contrasts for each of the four conditions of interest were created, comparing active conditions with resting baseline. Moreover, in order to modulate condition effects by autonomic measures, two additional first\u2010level models were implemented for each participant, which consisted of the same six box\u2010car regressors with parametric modulation by either heart rate or pupil diameter. To this aim, heart rate and pupil diameter values were averaged over each 36\u2010s block (see below) and these mean values were entered as parametric modulators of each condition regressor in two separate models. Brain activity specific to each condition and co\u2010varying with either heart rate or pupil diameter could therefore be assessed. For each of the latter two models, four simple contrasts were created for modulated active conditions versus resting baseline. All first\u2010level models furthermore included high\u2010pass filtering using a cutoff of 1/128\u2009Hz, global intensity normalization and serial correlations correction using a first\u2010order autoregressive model. \n\n\n##### Second\u2010level analyses \n  \nFor group analyses, individual contrasts were entered into a random\u2010effects model, using the flexible factorial tool in SPM8. A repeated\u2010measures 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 ANOVA model was implemented, with task difficulty (two levels: 0\u2010back and 2\u2010back) and threat (two levels: safe and threat) as within\u2010subject factors. Main effects investigated brain activations (i.e., 2\u2010back >\u20090\u2010back and threat > safe) and brain deactivations (i.e., 2\u2010back <\u20090\u2010back and threat < safe) related with TNT difficulty and level of threat. Moreover, difficulty \u00d7 threat interaction effects investigated differences in brain mechanisms elicited by cognitive effort, during threat and safe conditions. We implemented 3\u00a0s\u2010level ANOVA models, using individual contrasts derived from first\u2010level analyses (a) without any parametric modulation, (b) with heart rate parametric modulation, and (c) with pupil diameter parametric modulation. In the group analysis that does not take autonomic modulation into account, activations were investigated at an initial voxel\u2010level threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 uncorrected, with an extent threshold of 10 voxels, and a cluster\u2010level threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 corrected for multiple comparisons (family wise error\u2010FWE) at the whole\u2010brain level was applied. We reported only the clusters surviving this correction for all contrasts investigated. For the complementary exploratory group analyses which included autonomic parametric modulation analyses, sensitivity was favored over specificity (Wilke,\u00a0 ). Therefore, significance was assumed at   p  \u2009<\u2009.005, uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Since we were particularly interested in ECN regions, we used SPM's small volume correction (SVC) at specific MNI coordinates in the DLPFC previously established as functionally connected to a pupil\u2010related network (DiNuzzo et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n##### Functional connectivity analysis \n  \nTask\u2010based connectivity analysis was performed using the SPM CONN toolbox ( ) to investigate changes in connectivity due to the threat of auditory stressors. For each participant, realignment parameters were entered as first\u2010level covariates, and preprocessed functional images were denoised (using standard CONN procedures) to remove unwanted motion artifacts prior to calculation of connectivity measures. A band\u2010pass filter of 0.008\u20130.09\u2009Hz was applied. ROI\u2010to\u2010ROI connectivity estimates were computed from correlations of BOLD signal between seed regions evidencing significant effects during threat with all ROIs from the CONN atlas. At the second\u2010level, differences in connectivity between threat and safe conditions were analyzed across all participants. Significant changes in connectivity due to threat were assessed at a threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. \n\n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Anxiety and task difficulty subjective ratings \n  \nThe average levels of anxiety induced by the four experimental conditions were 0.90 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a00.85) for \u201c0\u2010back safe,\u201d 1.95 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a01.28) for \u201c0\u2010back threat,\u201d 3.65 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a01.90) for \u201c2\u2010back safe,\u201d and 5.10 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a02.17) for \u201c2\u2010back threat\u201d (Figure\u00a0 , top left panel). Subjective anxiety was significantly higher in the 2\u2010back versus 0\u2010back condition [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a051.71,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a0.73] and in the threat versus safe condition [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a015.72,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a0.45]. The interaction term was also significant [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a04.75,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.042,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a0.20], with increased anxiety when threat and 2\u2010back conditions were combined. \n  \nSubjective ratings, behavioral performance and autonomic nervous system activity measures for each level of TNT difficulty (0\u2010back and 2\u2010back) and threat conditions (safe and threat),   n  \u00a0=\u00a020.

Repeated\u2010measures ANOVA showed that subjective difficulty was significantly higher in the 2\u2010back versus 0\u2010back condition [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a0133.45,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a0.88]. \n\n\n### n\u2010back performance \n  \n#### Percentage of correct responses \n  \nThe percentage of correct responses induced by the four experimental conditions were 94.44% (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a04.05) for \u201c0\u2010back safe,\u201d 94.71% (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a03.80) for \u201c0\u2010back threat,\u201d 78.70% (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a020.31) for \u201c2\u2010back safe,\u201d and 78.14% (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a020.25) for \u201c2\u2010back threat\u201d (Figure\u00a0 , middle left panel). Participants showed lower percentage of correct response with increased difficulty [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a018.33,   p\u2009<  \u00a0.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a0.49]. The threat of unpredictable auditory stressors did not impact accuracy (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.853). The interaction term was not significant (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.502). \n\n\n#### d\u2010prime \n  \nThe average d\u2010prime induced by the four experimental conditions was 2.43 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a00.22) for \u201c0\u2010back safe,\u201d 2.48 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a00.24) for \u201c0\u2010back threat,\u201d 1.63 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a00.64) for \u201c2\u2010back safe,\u201d and 1.60 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a00.55) for \u201c2\u2010back threat.\u201d Participants showed lower d\u2010prime with increased difficulty [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a0118.31,   p\u2009<  \u00a0.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a0.86]. The threat of unpredictable auditory stressors did not significantly impact d\u2010prime values (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.696). The interaction term was not significant (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.270). \n\n\n#### Reaction times \n  \nThe reaction times induced by the four experimental conditions were 1.16\u00a0s (  SD  \u00a0=\u20090.27) for \u201c0\u2010back safe,\u201d 1.27\u00a0s (  SD  \u00a0=\u20090.29) for \u201c0\u2010back threat,\u201d 1.64\u00a0s (  SD  \u00a0=\u20090.25) for \u201c2\u2010back safe,\u201d and 1.57\u00a0s (  SD  \u00a0=\u20090.35) for \u201c2\u2010back threat\u201d (Figure\u00a0 , middle right panel). Participants showed longer reaction times with increased difficulty [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a054.73,   p  \u00a0<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u2009.74]. The main effect of threat was not significant (  p  \u00a0=\u2009.528). The difficulty \u00d7 threat interaction was significant [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a07.68,   p  \u00a0=\u2009.012,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u2009.12], showing an increase of reaction times due to threat in the 0\u2010back condition and a decrease of reaction times in the 2\u2010back condition. However, HSD post hoc tests revealed no significant pairwise comparisons between threat and safe conditions. \n\n\n\n### Autonomic nervous system results \n  \n#### Heart rate \n  \nThe mean heart rate induced by the four experimental conditions was 74.42\u2009bpm (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a08.60) for \u201c0\u2010back safe,\u201d 73.49\u2009bpm (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a08.38) for \u201c0\u2010back threat,\u201d 77.31\u2009bpm (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a08.61) for \u201c2\u2010back safe,\u201d and 76.63\u2009bpm (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a08.63) for \u201c2\u2010back threat\u201d (Figure\u00a0 , bottom left panel). Participants showed a higher heart rate with increased task difficulty [  F  (1,19]\u00a0=\u00a053.69,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a0.74]. The main effect of threat and the interaction term were not significant (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.180 and   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.419, respectively). \n\n\n#### Pupil diameter \n  \nThe mean pupil diameter induced by the four experimental conditions was 41.17\u2009mm (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a07.86) for \u201c0\u2010back safe,\u201d 41.16\u2009mm (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a07.58) for \u201c0\u2010back threat,\u201d 44.33\u2009mm (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a08.09) for \u201c2\u2010back safe,\u201d and 44.15\u2009mm (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a08.11) for \u201c2\u2010back threat\u201d (Figure\u00a0 , bottom right panel). Participants showed higher pupil diameter with increased task difficulty [  F  (1,19)\u00a0=\u00a060.08,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a0.76]. The main effect of threat and the interaction term were not significant (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.823 and   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.490, respectively). \n\n\n\n### Functional   MRI   results \n  \n#### Main effect of mental workload \n  \nLarge\u2010extent clusters of activity were found in the 2\u2010back versus 0\u2010back level of the TNT task (Figure\u00a0 ). We found increased activity in the left and right lateral parts of the middle frontal gyrus belonging to the DLPFC (BA 9), the dorsal ACC (BA 32), the supplementary motor area (SMA, BA 6), and the dorsal premotor cortex (BA 6). A large posterior cluster was also found covering bilateral parietal regions (BA 7/40). \n  \nBrain activations and deactivations related to mental workload.

Cortical areas evidencing increased (red color) and decreased (blue color) activations during the 2\u2010back versus 0\u2010back are presented. For illustrative purposes, maps are thresholded at   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 FWE corrected. Activations are superimposed on a subject anatomical T1 scan, normalized to the standard MNI space.

The percentage is calculated over all blocks, that is, safe and threat, for each task difficulty level. Error bars are   SEM  . Light gray\u00a0=\u00a00\u2010back, medium gray\u00a0=\u00a02\u2010back \n  \nConversely, some regions were less activated in the 2\u2010back compared with the 0\u2010back task. Such effects may represent regional deactivations when participants were engaged in the 2\u2010back condition. Significant deactivated clusters were observed in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC, with peaks located in BA 10/11) extending to the ventral ACC, the bilateral insula, the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), hippocampi and amygdala, and the posterior cingulate cortex. Regional activation and deactivation peaks are reported in Table\u00a0  and illustrated in Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nBrain activations and deactivations related to task difficulty (  p  \u2009<\u2009.005, FWE corrected) \n    \n\n#### Main effect of auditory stressors \n  \nWhen comparing threat versus safe conditions, activations were found in the bilateral parietal cortices (inferior parietal lobule, BA 40) and the SMA (Figure\u00a0 ). The inverse contrast (threat < safe) revealed large\u2010extent bilateral deactivated regions induced by the threat condition. The clusters encompassed bilateral superior temporal regions (STG, including primary and secondary auditory cortices) and extended to lower parietal regions and amygdala. Deactivations were also found in the DMPFC (BA 8/9/10), the ventral ACC (32), and the VMPFC (orbitofrontal cortex, BA47). Occipital regions were also deactivated, as well as the posterior cingulate gyrus (BA 31). Activation and deactivation peaks are reported in Table\u00a0  and illustrated in Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nBrain activations and deactivations related to the threat of auditory stressors.

We used bilateral Heschl's gyrus and amygdala atlas ROIs (from the CONN toolbox) as seeds to investigate functional connectivity with all other atlas ROIs. We then compared the connectivity strength between threat and safe conditions (irrespective of the level of task difficulty). At a threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 FDR\u2010corrected, auditory ROIs showed significant connectivity with dorsal prefrontal and parietal regions, although no significant difference in connectivity related to threat could be evidenced. Functional connectivity of amygdala regions with dorsal regions was also significant, and was increased during the threat of stressors (Figure\u00a0 ,   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 FDR\u2010corrected). More precisely, the connectivity between the right amygdala and right inferior parietal cortex (supramarginal gyrus) and the connectivity between the left amygdala and the MPFC were higher during threat (  t  \u00a0=\u00a03.04,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.007 FDR\u2010corrected for amygdala\u2010parietal and   t  \u00a0=\u00a02.24,   p  \u2009<\u2009.036 FDR\u2010corrected for amygdala\u2010prefrontal connectivity). \n  \nROI\u2010to\u2010ROI connectivity increases when comparing threat of auditory stressors and safe conditions (thresholded at   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 FDR\u2010corrected).

Error bars indicate   SEM  \n  \n\n#### Interaction between mental workload and auditory stressors \n  \nMental workload\u2010related increases of activity were more important during the threat compared with the safe condition, that is, positive Difficulty \u00d7 Threat interaction, in the bilateral superior parietal cortices, in the SMA (Figure\u00a0 ) and also in two clusters located in the DLPFC (BA 9/46). Conversely, load\u2010related decreases of activity were more pronounced during the threat condition, that is, negative Difficulty \u00d7 Threat interaction, in the VMPFC and bilateral hippocampus. Activation and deactivation peaks are reported in Table\u00a0  and illustrated in Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nBrain activations and deactivations evidenced in the Difficulty \u00d7 Threat interaction. (a) Statistical parametric maps illustrating the interaction effects between mental workload and threat of stressors. The colored bar indicates the   t  \u2010value (+4 to \u22124) of the activation height. Cortical areas evidencing positive (red color) and negative (blue color) interactions are shown.

During expectation of auditory stressors (threat > safe), the increase of activity in several brain regions was positively correlated with heart rate and pupil diameter. Heart rate variations were notably associated with modulations of activity in the occipital lobe, hippocampus, precuneus or ventral posterior cingulate cortex (Table\u00a0 ). Pupil diameter variations under the threat condition were associated with higher dorsal prefrontal regions (BA 9/8/10) and occipital activity (Table\u00a0 ). It is worth noting that pupillary changes track cognitive workload at a fine\u2010grained level. Therefore, as mental workload induced variations in tonic pupil diameter between blocks, it would also be interesting to perform a point\u2010by\u2010point correlation analysis (i.e., at the fMRI temporal resolution) between the phasic pupillary response and brain activity. However, due to technical difficulties, the pupillary and BOLD signals were point\u2010by\u2010point synchronized only in 12 participants. A further investigation of this sub\u2010sample might reveal correlations between workload\u2010induced changes in tonic pupil diameter, phasic pupillary response, and brain activations. \n  \nBrain activations positively correlated with heart rate and pupil diameter during threat of stressors (threat > safe,   p  \u2009<\u2009.005, uncorrected) \n    \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nWe investigated the way the brain deals with an important mental workload and/or a threat situation. We speculated that our TNT n\u2010back task with additional cognitive workload (mental calculation) would deteriorate under high workload and we expected greater involvement of the ECN regions. Overall, the slight decrease in performance indicated that task difficulty actually increased mental workload and provoked an enhanced activity in the ECN, in particular the lateral prefrontal and parietal regions, along with a disengagement of the DMN, including the medial prefrontal cortex. Task difficulty also clearly affected subjective difficulty and autonomic activity with increased heart rate and pupillary diameter. \n\nWe expected a moderate decrease of performance with the stressors, and a large decrease of performance related to the ECN disengagement when high task difficulty was combined with the stressors. This scenario turned out to be wrong despite increased subjective anxiety with threat. Preservation of performance under threat might be due to efficient cognitive strategies used by participants, as indexed by important changes in brain activity that accompanied the threat condition: an increase of the activity in the ECN regions (lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices) along with deactivation in SN regions (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus), as in the study by Clarke and Johnstone\u00a0( ). We also found large deactivations of the superior temporal regions, suggesting attentional filtering mechanism of the aversive stimuli. When high workload was combined with the stressors, we found a pattern quite similar to those observed with the high workload, with extra activation in the ECN regions along with deactivation of the VMPFC. \n\n### Increased mental workload was associated with reduced performance, higher   ECN   activity, and increased autonomic response \n  \nOur behavioral results indicated that increased mental workload was associated with a decrease in n\u2010back task accuracy and an increase in reaction times. Our extremely difficult task elicited activity in the fronto\u2010parietal network, including the DLPFC, the dorsal ACC, and the parietal cortex. These regions are part of the ECN (Shenhav et al.,\u00a0 ), which is considered to be more activated when an individual must perform a task demanding effort, sustained attention or maintenance of information in WM, and is less activated when performing more habitual behaviors (Shenhav et al.,\u00a0 ). ECN involvement has been notably reported during n\u2010back tasks (Jansma, Ramsey, Coppola, & Kahn,\u00a0 ; Luo et al.,\u00a0 ; Schmidt et al.,\u00a0 ). In our study, a large recruitment of the SMA and the premotor cortex (BA 6) was also found with increased load in WM. SMA is considered to be a modality independent circuitry sustaining WM processes (Schumacher et al.,\u00a0 ). This region was also markedly activated during n\u2010back performance in the Schmidt et al.\u00a0( ) study. Moreover, the SMA and premotor cortex have been associated with mental calculation (Hanakawa et al.,\u00a0 ). In our 2\u2010back TNT condition, participants had to compute an exact arithmetic result to compare it with the target obtained two trials before. In the 0\u2010back condition that implied to compare the arithmetic result with \u201c50,\u201d it is likely that estimating the order of magnitude of the result was sufficient to complete the task. Accordingly, higher workload in our task resulted in increased activation of motor and ECN regions (Gruber et al.,\u00a0 ), that is, an extended fronto\u2010parietal network. \n\nBesides ECN involvement, several cortical areas owning to the DMN (Fransson & Marrelec,\u00a0 ; Greicius et al.,\u00a0 ; Raichle et al.,\u00a0 ; Ward et al.,\u00a0 ) showed large deactivations in response to increased mental effort, including the medial PFC (i.e., DMPFC and VMPFC), the PCC, the ventral ACC, and the middle temporal gyrus. The DMN, active during awake rest, would be implicated in the generation of spontaneous task\u2010unrelated thoughts (Mason et al.,\u00a0 ) whose occurrence can represent a source of internal distraction (Hinds et al.,\u00a0 ). It has been shown that regions involved in the DMN could also evidence increased activity when the task is too difficult, reflecting a disengagement from the task (Buckner, Andrews\u2010Hanna, & Schacter,\u00a0 ). Greater involvement of the DMN can thus negatively affect the performance of a demanding task (Smallwood, Beach, Schooler, & Handy,\u00a0 ), including driving a vehicle (Gal\u00e9ra et al.,\u00a0 ; He, Becic, Lee, & McCarley,\u00a0 ) or flying a plane (Casner & Schooler,\u00a0 ; Durantin, Dehais, & Delorme,\u00a0 ). In our study, regions owning to the SN were also deactivated with task difficulty, in particular the amygdala and the insula. Taken together, our data, therefore, suggest efficient allocation of neural resources to the ECN at the expense of the DMN and the SN, that is, efficient brain mechanisms to perform the complex 2\u2010back task. \n\nRegarding autonomic measures, heart rate and pupil diameter were increased during the 2\u2010back condition, indicating physiological arousal with a shift of the balance of the autonomic nervous system toward a sympathetic dominance (Simpson et al.,\u00a0 ). High workload activated the dorsal brainstem, which may reflect additional locus coeruleus (LC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) nuclei involvement. LC and VTA phasic response may have induced transient increases in catecholamine levels, thereby enhancing DLPFC activity and facilitating executive and WM processes to maintain performance to respond to increased task difficulty (Arnsten,\u00a0 ; Sara,\u00a0 ; Yuen et al.,\u00a0 ). In addition, an increase of catecholamine brain levels induces stimulation of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system (Sara & Bouret,\u00a0 ). Our observation of higher heart rate and pupil size in the 2\u2010back trials is therefore consistent with phasic catecholamine release. \n\n\n### Task performance was preserved despite the stressors:   SN   disengagement and inhibition of the auditory processing \n  \nThe threat condition resulted in significantly higher anxiety ratings, although it did not elicit significant behavioral or autonomic modifications. Preservation of performance under stressors in our complex WM task is coherent with several previous studies that have used single\u2010letter\u2010 or digit\u2010n\u2010back tasks (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Cousijn et al.,\u00a0 ; Duncko et al.,\u00a0 ; Porcelli et al.,\u00a0 ; Qin et al.,\u00a0 ) as well as similar highly demanding WM task (Mandrick et al.,\u00a0 ). Our neuroimaging results suggest that maintaining performance under stress induction was likely conditioned by additional allocation of neural resources within the ECN toward the cognitive task (Eysenck & Calvo,\u00a0 ; Mandrick et al.,\u00a0 ), inhibition of the STG to reduce auditory stressor processing, and inhibition of limbic regions of the SN for emotional regulation. \n\nThe threat condition was dominated by significant deactivations in the STG and cuneus, extending to the posterior cingulate gyrus. Deactivations were also observed in the dorsal and ventral medial PFC, the ACC, the insula and the amygdala. Deactivation of the STG most certainly reflects inhibition of auditory processing during the expectation of aversive loud sounds. Deactivation of brain regions has been probably under\u2010considered in the past because of the inclination to deal primarily with the neural activation effects induced by stimulation, rather than with any possible decrements in neural activity. Yet, it is well known that humans have the capacity to selectively enhance or inhibit sensory brain regions via top\u2010down attentional mechanisms (Mozolic et al.,\u00a0 ). Our result may thus be interpreted in several ways. First, the focal task (i.e., the TNT) may have consumed most attentional resources, provoking a reduced distractor effect (Hu, Bauer, Padmala, & Pessoa,\u00a0 ) since attention was shifted away from the aversive auditory stimuli (Pessoa, McKenna, Gutierrez, & Ungerleider,\u00a0 ). Consequently, less attention was paid to \u201cexpect\u201d and to process the sounds. An additional and more cognitively active explanation is that inhibition of auditory processing may have contributed to filter the unwanted noises. Interestingly, top\u2010down inhibitory mechanisms have been proposed to explain the attenuation of unpleasant sounds in the context of tinnitus habituation (Rauschecker, Leaver, & M\u00fchlau,\u00a0 ). Such selective sensory inhibition is thought to take place over long periods of time and following repetitive aversive stimulation. Although this long\u2010term neural adaptation could not occur in our experiment, it is possible that similar initial control mechanisms helped to protect from its stressful effects. Note, however, that the useful deactivations of large temporal regions are to be interpreted within a specific context, since \u201cignoring\u201d a stressful stimulus is not always a good strategy. When extreme, this phenomenon has been described as inattentional deafness and is subtended by inhibitory brain mechanisms of the auditory processing (Dehais, Roy, & Scannella,\u00a0 ; Giraudet, St\u2010Louis, Scannella, & Causse,\u00a0 ). While it may be useful when the aversive auditory stimulus is an unwanted disturbance, it becomes dangerous when it is a security alarm that is ignored. This points to the complexity of using physiological measures to assist the operator, and the need to go deeper into the understanding of these mechanisms. \n\nFurthermore, several regions of the SN (and in particular the VMPFC, anterior insula, and amygdala) were deactivated during the threat condition, as observed in other studies (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Pruessner et al.,\u00a0 ; Simpson et al.,\u00a0 ), suggesting implication of emotional regulation mechanisms during threat. Consistent with the latter interpretation, the functional connectivity between dorsal prefrontal/parietal regions and amygdala was increased during the threat condition. In rodents, the MPFC and amygdala have a major role in stress\u2010related behaviors, and MPFC has an important role in the regulation of amygdala response to emotional stimuli (Andolina, Maran, Valzania, Conversi, & Puglisi\u2010Allegra,\u00a0 ). Such regulation mechanisms through top\u2010down control exerted by the PFC on the amygdala have been reported in humans, during concurrent cognitive and emotional tasks (Loos et al.,\u00a0 ; for review see Okon\u2010Singer, Hendler, Pessoa, & Shackman,\u00a0 ). Consistently, our functional connectivity results suggest that, in our experiment, top\u2010down control on SN regions may have occurred during threat of stressors. In particular, the deactivation of the anterior insula may explain the absence of visible effects of the threat condition on heart rate and pupil size measures, despite self\u2010report of increased anxiety. \n\nWhen stressors were concomitant with high workload, performance remained preserved. We observed that deactivation of the VMPFC was greater (i.e., negative interaction effect). Therefore, deactivation of this region may be critical for optimal cognitive performance when facing both high load context and the threat of stressors. Bilateral hippocampus deactivations can be also linked to decreased activity in the SN. Previous studies found that the SN plays a critical role in mediating the interaction between emotion perception and executive control (Luo et al.,\u00a0 ). Moreover, we observed supplementary activity in the SMA, in the DLPFC, as well as in the left parietal cortex (i.e., positive interaction effect). These regions were also implicated in the TNT performance in the safe condition. This increased brain activity in task related regions suggests that additional cognitive resources were engaged to preserve performance. Similar increases of activity in the ECN regions under stressors were found in previous studies (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Porcelli et al.,\u00a0 ) and arithmetic tasks (Dedovic et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nInterestingly, we found that activity in dorsal medial and lateral PFC regions was related with pupil dilation under stress induction. Pupil dilation dynamics has been closely associated with LC activity (both tonic and phasic, Joshi, Li, Kalwani, & Gold,\u00a0 ) and may be a reliable proxy measure of norepinephrine (NE) release and sympathetic involvement. Activity in the dorsal frontal gyrus was found to be related with pupil size during rest (DiNuzzo et al.,\u00a0 ), thus reflecting variations of tonic NE brain levels. Therefore, in our study, pupil dilation likely indexed the increased activity in the dorsal PFC regions implicated in the cognitive task and enhanced under the threat of the stressors, as a result of a tonic increase in brain catecholamines. \n\nAltogether, our results showed that facing high load context and the threat of stressors could be characterized by a specific pattern of PFC activity. Increased activation of the ECN would play a role for the maintenance of cognitive performance, while diminishing sensory processing. This would be explained by exhaustion of attentional resources or inhibition, that helped modulating the impact of the auditory stressors. Without being contradictory to these mechanisms, successful preservation of performance may have been possible in our experiment since actual stress level was probably relatively moderate, as inferred from anxiety ratings (i.e., 5.10 in the \u201c2\u2010back threat\u201d condition, on a 0\u201310 scale) and the lack of increased sympathetic activity, in particular the heart rate that is known to be sensitive to acute stress (Yao et al.,\u00a0 ). It has been shown that passive exposure to loud aversive sounds induces significant activations in the SN and dorsal brainstem, thus clearly evidencing a marked stress response (Zald & Pardo,\u00a0 ). However, the threat of intermittent aversive sounds, as used in our study, may have been less stressful than direct exposure to permanent sounds, but we aimed at eliminating possible distraction effects. One must acknowledge that despite the subjective and neuroimaging results that suggest efficient cognitive strategies, the lack of behavioral and physiological effects of the stressor can raise a doubt on the effectiveness of the stress manipulation. Indeed, an intense level of stress would have probably provoked an increased level of emotional arousal indexed by a heightened autonomic nervous system activity. We can also postulate that a more efficient and intense stressor would have degraded task performance and elicited different patterns of brain activations, in particular with the recruitment of regions pertaining to the SN. \n\n\n### How far do we need to go to observe cognitive disengagement? \n  \nCompared with previous studies on concomitant cognitive task and acute stress, our primary goal was to increase the mental effort with a task that combined WM and mental calculation, two cognitive processes that rely on the ECN. We did not observe a drop of performance or a decrease in ECN function when combined with stress. There are three ways to induce cognitive disengagement in such experimental design: increasing the load, increasing the stress or increasing both of them. The increase of the cognitive load is limited: the task would have to be hardly feasible without stress and become unfeasible when stress is administered. We think that this ceiling of difficulty might have been reached with the very difficult TNT. However, participants did adapt with the threat of aversive sounds, and performance at the task was similar with and without stress. Increasing the level or changing the nature of stress, may therefore, in this context, be the solution. Given the mentioned low efficiency (and possibly zero efficiency in some participants) of the threat of aversive sounds, for future experiments, we would suggest turning to other types of stressors. For example, psychosocial stress is difficult to filter out, contrarily to auditory stressors, and have been proven to reduce performance (Jiang & Rau,\u00a0 ; Schoofs et al.,\u00a0 ). These scenarios are not easy to implement in an fMRI experiment because to be efficient, they must be very realistic. This would be however a great challenge and an interesting path that may well fit with the high levels of stress that airplane pilots experience due to high hierarchical pressure, huge financial outcomes, and even life and death responsibility. \n\nIt is also important to note that experimental 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 designs combining factors of workload and stress, such as used in our and others' studies (Clarke & Johnstone,\u00a0 ; Cousijn et al.,\u00a0 ; Duncko et al.,\u00a0 ; Jiang & Rau,\u00a0 ; Porcelli et al.,\u00a0 ; Qin et al.,\u00a0 ; Schoofs et al.,\u00a0 ), remain approximate to selectively point out effects of stress on cognition. Indeed, cognitive task difficulty itself can induce acute stress. In our study, both levels of subjective difficulty and anxiety were increased by higher task load, and one might argue that task\u2010related stress might have participated in the observed shift toward sympathetic dominance. Indeed, increased workload in a challenging task can elicit a mixture of mental workload and acute stress since the task can be emotionally challenging (Parent et al.,\u00a0 ). Raised anxiety related to task performance was evidenced by Simpson et al.\u00a0( ). The authors assumed that anxiety is a likely accompaniment of most demanding cognitive tasks conducted in a laboratory or imaging settings, especially during na\u00efve task performance. As a consequence, areas of the brain concerned with emotion may change in concert with those more directly concerned with the cognitive aspects of the tasks. However, in our study, brain regions related to the 2\u2010back condition largely suggest that task\u2010related stress remained moderate as no clear activation of the SN was evidenced. Conversely, the opposite pattern was observed, that is, deactivation of the SN. \n\n\n### Perspectives for neuroergonomics \n  \nComplex and safety\u2010critical activities such as piloting can lead to an increase of both mental workload and acute stress, whose effects can engender poor cognitive performance, bad decisions (Maier, Makwana, & Hare,\u00a0 ), and eventually accidents. In this context, the maintenance of optimal cognitive performance is a constant challenge. Here we observed that high load context and the threat of stressors may be overcome thanks to compensatory mechanisms. The balance of high activity in the ECN combined with reduced activity in the SN and the DMN were markers of efficient brain mechanisms and preserved performance. Conversely, with more load and more intense stress, the disruption of this balance may be used as a marker of cognitive disengagement and disability to appropriately face an emergency. As in situ measurements of mental workload are expanding rapidly with the development of field\u2010deployable neuroimaging tools like functional Near\u2010Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), caution must be taken, especially when safety\u2010related decisions are supported by physiological objective measurements. Our results confirmed that increased activity in the DLPFC, belonging to the dorsal fronto\u2010parietal network, successfully indexed effortful (but efficient) mental activity. This effortful mental activity was accompanied by a reduction of the DMN activations, including the DMPFC. During combined high workload and threat of stressors, greater deactivations were observed in the VMPFC. Using frontal fNIRS, the DLPFC/medial PFC cerebral blood flow ratio could thus efficiently index mental workload and emotional regulation. \n\nRegarding autonomic measures, increased heart rate and pupil diameter in the more demanding task confirmed that variations in heart rate and pupil diameter can be reliable indexes of mental workload during task performance. This is consistent with a large body of literature (Kahneman & Beatty,\u00a0 ; Shine et al.,\u00a0 ; van der Wel & van Steenbergen,\u00a0 ), including studies addressing critical domains like piloting (Peysakhovich et al.,\u00a0 ; Roscoe,\u00a0 ; Wilson,\u00a0 ). Among promising applications, we can cite the evaluation of systems during the certification process via the objective evaluation of the mental workload and stress they can generate, adaptive automation (Byrne & Parasuraman,\u00a0 ), crew monitoring in the cockpit, or driver monitoring in autonomous vehicles. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nOur results have highlighted the cerebral and physiological signature of high mental workload and threat of auditory stressors. Mental workload was characterized by a marked activation of the ECN along with disengagement of the DMN and SN. Cardiovascular activity and pupillary diameter were good indicators of mental workload, with possible links between pupil diameter variations and superior frontal activity. Threat of auditory stressors did not result in changes in autonomic activity or task performance but increased recruitment of task\u2010related regions (in particular the ECN, with lateral prefrontal and parietal regions, as well as the SMA), decreased activation of the medial PFC, and deactivation of auditory and SN regions were observed, suggesting adaptive brain mechanisms to focus on the task and inhibit processing of the stressors and regulate emotion. During concomitant high workload and stressors, we observed a similar pattern with higher recruitment of task\u2010related regions and decreased activation of the medial PFC. \n\nOur results critically underline that extra recruitment of task\u2010related regions, in particular in the lateral prefrontal and parietal regions, and a pattern of PFC activations/deactivations, that is, increased lateral PFC and decreased medial PFC activity, may represent a relevant marker of preserved performance and successful management of both high load and threat of stressors. We can however assume that stress levels were moderate in our experiment and more intense stress may have finally resulted in different patterns of activations and a performance decrement. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: hbm25703-tbl-0001\n### Label: TABLE 1\nRegion\tLaterality\tBA\tX\tY\tZ\tt\u2010value\n2\u2010back\u2009>\u20090\u2010back\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSMA\tLeft\t6\t\u22124\t16\t48\t12.78\nDorsal premotor cortex\tLeft\t6\t\u221236\t0\t58\t10.57\n\tRight\t6\t30\t\u22122\t54\t9.66\nDLPFC\tRight\t9\t38\t34\t30\t9.32\n\tLeft\t9/46\t\u221238\t32\t28\t9.3\n\tLeft\t10\t\u221234\t60\t10\t8.07\n\tLeft\t46\t\u221246\t20\t26\t9.74\nDorsal ACC\tRight\t32\t14\t22\t30\t7.64\nAnterior insula\tLeft\t13\t\u221228\t28\t\u22122\t8.73\nAngular gyrus\tLeft\t39\t\u221230\t\u221264\t36\t9.82\nSuperior parietal gyrus\tLeft\t7\t\u221230\t\u221264\t52\t8.81\nInferior parietal lobule\tLeft\t40\t\u221250\t\u221244\t44\t9.42\nPrecuneus\tLeft\t7\t\u22126\t\u221260\t48\t9.39\n\tRight\t7\t8\t\u221262\t52\t8.68\nCerebellum\tRight\t\t30\t\u221264\t\u221230\t10.22\nMedial globus pallidus\tLeft\t\t\u221214\t\u22124\t2\t8.67\nThalamus\tLeft\t\t\u22128\t\u221224\t14\t7.77\nDorsal brainstem\t\t\t2\t\u221236\t\u221216\t7.86\n2\u2010back\u2009<\u20090\u2010back\t\t\t\t\t\t\nVMPFC\tMedial\t11\t0\t44\t\u221212\t9.93\nVentral ACC\tLeft\t10/32\t\u22128\t40\t\u22128\t9.79\nDMPFC\tLeft\t9\t\u221216\t54\t32\t8.63\n\tRight\t8\t12\t40\t56\t7.39\nVentral premotor cortex\tLeft\t6\t\u221250\t\u22124\t6\t7.55\nAnterior parietal cortex\tRight\t40\t54\t\u221226\t20\t9.37\nParahippocampal gyrus\tRight\t28/35\t24\t\u221214\t\u221216\t9.52\n\tLeft\t35\t\u221224\t\u221222\t\u221218\t9.42\nSuperior temporal gyrus\tRight\t22\t60\t0\t\u22122\t8.21\nMiddle temporal gyrus\tLeft\t21\t\u221262\t\u221210\t\u221214\t8.19\n\tRight\t21\t54\t0\t\u221228\t7.02\n\tLeft\t38\t\u221254\t0\t\u221222\t6.85\n\tLeft\t38\t\u221248\t0\t\u221232\t6.72\nAngular gyrus\tLeft\t39\t\u221250\t\u221266\t32\t5.94\nAmygdala\tRight\t\t26\t\u22124\t\u221220\t8.22\nPosterior insula\tLeft\t13\t\u221240\t\u221210\t0\t8.47\n\tRight\t13\t40\t\u221214\t\u22126\t7.47\nDorsal ACC\tMedial\t24\t\u22124\t\u22126\t46\t8.73\nDorsal PCC\tMedial\t23\t\u22124\t\u221250\t28\t8.21\n### Caption\nBrain activations and deactivations related to task difficulty (p\u2009<\u2009.005, FWE corrected)\n### Footer\nAbbreviations: ACC, anterior cingulate cortex;

One of the main complications of this surgery however is a decline in language abilities. The magnitude of this decline is related to the degree of language lateralization to the left hemisphere. Most fMRI paradigms used to determine language dominance in epileptic populations have used active language tasks. Sometimes, these paradigms are too complex and may result in patient underperformance. Only a few studies have used purely passive tasks, such as listening to standard speech. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nIn the present study we characterized language lateralization in patients with MTLE using a rapid and passive semantic language task. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study 23 patients [12 with Left (LMTLE), 11 with Right mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (RMTLE)] and 19 healthy right-handed controls using a 6\u00a0minute long semantic task in which subjects passively listened to groups of sentences (SEN) and pseudo sentences (PSEN). A lateralization index (LI) was computed using a priori regions of interest of the temporal lobe. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe LI for the significant contrasts produced activations for all participants in both temporal lobes. 81.8% of RMTLE patients and 79% of healthy individuals had a bilateral language representation for this particular task. However, 50% of LMTLE patients presented an atypical right hemispheric dominance in the LI. More importantly, the degree of right lateralization in LMTLE patients was correlated with the age of epilepsy onset. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe simple, rapid, non-collaboration dependent, passive task described in this study, produces a robust activation in the temporal lobe in both patients and controls and is capable of illustrating a pattern of atypical language organization for LMTLE patients. Furthermore, we observed that the atypical right-lateralization patterns in LMTLE patients was associated to earlier age at epilepsy onset. These results are in line with the idea that early onset of epileptic activity is associated to larger neuroplastic changes. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nTemporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common cause of intractable epilepsy in adults, can be successfully cured by surgery\n[ ]. Partial removal of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) remains the most common form of surgical treatment and is effective in 60-80% of patients\n[ - ]. A complication of surgery observed in 30-50% of patients after left ATL resection is a decline in language or verbal memory function\n[ - ]. The magnitude of decline is related to the degree of language lateralization to the left hemisphere and can be predicted using preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI;\n[ - ]. \n\nA decrease of regional cerebral metabolism unilateral to the epileptogenic focus has been observed in patients with intractable TLE, usually in temporal and occasionally prefrontal regions\n[ ]. Similarly, the reorganization of language may also affect different productive (located in frontal areas) and perceptive (located in temporal regions) language functions mainly in temporal rather than frontal areas\n[ , ]. Atypical functional lateralization for refractory epileptic patients during fMRI language tasks has been widely reported with either bilateral or right lateralized patterns of activation\n[ ]. This is predominant in patients suffering from left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy LMTLE;\n[ , , - ]. \n\nAlthough the tasks employed by epilepsy institutes vary greatly, most fMRI paradigms used to determine the language dominance in epileptic populations include language production paradigms such as word or verb generation\n[ , , - ], object naming\n[ ], or sentence repetition\n[ ]. More complex paradigms involving semantic decisions have also been used\n[ , , , , ]. All these paradigms require the patient to perform an active action (e.g., naming a word, making a semantic decision) which critically depends on his/her capacity to collaborate during the execution of the task. Paradigms that are too complex might result in patient underperformance, yielding poor activation patterns. \n\nSurprisingly, only a few studies of epilepsy sufferers have used pure passive tasks such as listening to standard speech\n[ , , ]. Passive listening paradigms reliably activate the receptive language cortex\n[ ] making it possible to determine hemispheric dominance and identify the areas involved in language processing of TLE patients, which is of the utmost importance in pre-surgical language mapping\n[ , ]. These tasks commonly bring about activations in Wernicke's area \u2013mainly the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), frequently extending into the angular gyrus- but also in the primary auditory area and less often in frontal regions\n[ , , , ]. A study comprising healthy children\n[ ] showed that both passive listening and active-response story processing yielded activations in the primary auditory cortex and the STG bilaterally and also in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). It has also been shown in TLE patients with atypical language patterns that plastic cortical reorganization can affect frontal and temporal language areas differently with greater reorganization of language circuits in the temporal rather than the frontal lobe\n[ , ]. This suggests that productive and receptive functions can be affected by the pathological process in different ways. In contrast with productive tasks, passive tasks are easy to perform, less dependent on patient collaboration and allow the assessment of how fronto-temporal networks contribute to other aspects of language processing. In addition, the pattern of activation of some receptive language paradigms can be as lateralized as that of verbal fluency or semantic decision tasks\n[ , , - ]. However, it is also well-known that using a baseline condition such as fixation or rest can lead to more bilateral activations\n[ ]. \n\nThe main purpose of this study is to investigate the reliability of a passive, non-collaboration dependent, semantic fMRI language task in evaluating language lateralization patterns in a group of selected left and right mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (RMTLE) patients. These results were compared to those of a well-matched healthy group. Based on previous studies, we expected to observe a clear increase of right-hemisphere lateralization associated to earlier age at epilepsy onset in LMTLE patients\n[ , ]. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-three native Spanish patients (15 women) with refractory epilepsy of the temporal lobe were evaluated using an fMRI passive language paradigm. Twelve patients had a left hemispheric focus (LMTLE group) with the remaining eleven exhibiting the right (RMTLE group). All patients underwent pre-surgical evaluation which included long-term in-patient video-electroencephalogram (video-EEG) monitoring with clinical and EEG assessment, neuropsychological testing, brain MRI and psychiatric evaluation. All patients were considered good candidates for resective mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) surgery. Twenty-two patients were right handed with only one left-handed right MTLE patient, as assessed by the Edinburgh handedness test\n[ ]. Structural MRI on a 3\u00a0T Siemens Trio MRI system showed mesial temporal sclerosis in all patients with no other lesions found. \n\nNineteen healthy native Spanish subjects (9 women) were studied using the same fMRI and neuropsychological protocols. All controls were right handed as assessed by the Edinburgh handedness test\n[ ] and had no record of neurological illness. None of the patients or controls had hearing disabilities. \n\nWe found no statistical differences between groups (n.s, all p\u2009>\u20090.4, see Table\u00a0\n ) in age (RMTLE, LMTLE, controls) or age at epilepsy onset (RMTLE, LMTLE). The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of University Hospital of Bellvitge and informed consent was obtained from all patients and controls. \n  \nDemographics, neuropsychological results and mean LI for each group and contrast \n  \nLMTLE, Left Temporal Lobe Epilepsy; RMTLE, Right Temporal Lobe Epilepsy; SS, scaled score; IQ, Intelligence Coefficient estimation; BNT, Boston Naming Test; *Subtests of the Barcelona test; **Subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale III; SEN, Passive Listening to Sentences; PSEN, Passive Listening to Pseudo Sentences. \n\nAll values are reported with mean and standard deviation. LIs lower than -0.4 are considered right lateralized, with LIs larger than 0.4 being considered left lateralized. LIs between -0.4 and 0.4 are considered bilateral.; For the handedness the scores were evaluated according to the following scale 1\u2009=\u2009Right and 5\u2009=\u2009Left; (for the interpretation of the results see methods section). \n  \n\n### Neuropsychological testing \n  \nNeuropsychological data are summarized in Table\u00a0\n . All patients and controls completed a set of subtests from the Wechsler Memory Scale III and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III (immediate and delayed verbal memory; immediate and delayed visual memory)\n[ ]. The Boston Naming Test\n[ ] and Semantic and Phonological fluency tests\n[ ] were also carried out in order to explore naming abilities and verbal fluency. All these scores were compared to normative data, minimizing the possible bias of age and education in further statistical analysis. No statistical differences between the RMTLE group, LMTLE group and controls were found in any of the neuropsychological tests (n.s., all   p  \u2009>\u20090.15); however a marginal effect was found for years of education (n.s., p\u2009>\u20090.06). Following previous studies\n[ ] we ensured that all participants had an IQ estimation \u226570, measured by the Vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III. \n\n\n### MRI scanning \n  \nImages were acquired using a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Trio MRI system at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. A T1-weighted image (slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u00a0mm; no gap; number of slices\u2009=\u2009240; TR\u2009=\u20092300\u00a0ms; TE\u2009=\u20093\u00a0ms; matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256; FOV\u2009=\u2009244\u00a0mm) was acquired. Two functional runs of 90 echo-planar images were acquired using a single-shot T2*-weighted gradient-echo EPI sequence (slice thickness\u2009= 4\u00a0mm; no gap; number of slices\u2009=\u200932, interleaved order; TR\u2009=\u20092000\u00a0ms; TE\u2009=\u200929\u00a0ms; flip angle\u2009=\u200980\u00b0; matrix\u2009= 128\u00d7128; FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u00a0mm; voxel size\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20094 mm ). \n\n\n### Experimental design \n  \nStimuli consisted of 20 well-formed Spanish sentences (SEN) containing 8 words (e.g., \"  En el museo hay una exposici\u00f3n de mariposas  \", meaning \"  There is an exhibition of butterflies in the museum  \") and 20 meaningless pseudo sentences (PSEN) (e.g., \"  An er sureo tas uma emdorici\u00f3s ne sacidosar  \"). PSENs were derived from well-formed sentences by substituting phonemes based on Spanish phonotactical rules, thus matching the original stimuli in phonemic complexity and length\n[ ]. All stimuli were recorded using a native Spanish speaker reading the sentences. Patients were instructed to listen carefully to the stimuli as they would be required to answer some questions at the end of the session. \n\nThe stimuli was presented over two runs of a blocked design paradigm. Each run contained three experimental conditions: passive listening to SENs, passive listening to PSENs and rest. SEN and PSEN blocks contained 5 sentences each, with a total block duration of 30\u00a0seconds and were each followed by 15\u00a0second rest periods. Each run contained two blocks of SEN and PSEN conditions and 4 of rest, yielding a total task duration of 6\u00a0minutes over the two runs. \n\n\n### fMRI analysis and Lateralization Index calculation \n  \nAnalysis of fMRI data was carried out using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8; Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College, London, UK,\n ) and MATLAB 7.8.0 (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, Mass). Echo-planar imaging (EPI) volumes were first spatially realigned and resliced with respect to the first volume of the first run. Each participant\u2019s T1 image was coregistered to the mean EPI volume produced in the previous spatial realignment step. Then, using each coregistered T1 scan, the normalization parameters needed to transform the data to MNI152 space were obtained by means of Unified Segmentation\n[ ], which combines segmentation, bias correction and spatial normalization under the same iterative model. This method has been successfully applied to both healthy and patient populations\n[ ]. Finally, normalized EPI images were resliced to 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2\u00a0mm and smoothed with an 8\u00a0mm full-width at half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel. \n\nA general linear model was created using SEN, PSEN and rest conditions and the motion parameters extracted from the realignment phase. After model estimation, statistical parametrical maps for the SEN and PSEN conditions versus rest and for SEN versus PSEN were created. The first objective of this study was to assess whether a passive semantic task as the one presented could elicit robust activation of the temporal lobe at the subject-level. Thus, individual first level contrasts were inspected in order to compare the activations in individual subjects between active task and rest contrasts (SEN vs. rest, PSEN vs. rest) and contrasts involving only active blocks (SEN vs. PSEN) using a p\u2009<\u20090.001 uncorrected threshold with 20\u00a0voxels of cluster extent. The SEN vs. PSEN contrast did not elicit significant differences in around 40% of the subjects (see Results) and no laterality indexes or group contrasts were derived. No further analysis was conducted here as a contrast that shows no robust activations in all participants is of poor clinical use. \n\nActive versus rest contrasts (PSEN vs. rest and SEN vs. rest) however elicited activations at the subject level in 100% of the participants (see Results) and were therefore both well-suited for clinical use. Group activations were then calculated using a one-sample t-test. These contrasts were calculated to provide a general idea of the pattern of activations in each group and therefore are reported at a false discovery rate corrected (FDR-corrected) p\u2009<\u20090.05 threshold with 20\u00a0voxels of cluster extent, to correct for multiple comparisons. \n\nFor each subject and for both PSEN vs. rest and SEN vs. rest contrasts, a Lateralization Index (LI) was calculated using a region of interest (ROI) which included the STG, MTG, inferior temporal gyri (ITG) and the anterior temporal lobe\n[ ]; see Figure\u00a0\n . The rationale behind this anatomical selection is based on the importance of ATL regions in MTLE patients, areas which are typically resected for epilepsy treatment\n[ , ]. The ROIs were generated using the Automated Anatomical Atlas\n[ ] and the toolbox WFU PickAtlas\n[ , ]. The LI is calculated as: \n\n\n  \n Individual LIs for each participant and for both SEN vs. Rest and PSEN vs. Rest contrasts.   LIs under -0.4 are considered right lateralized, with LIs being larger than 0.4 being considered left lateralized. LIs between -0.4 and 0.4 are considered bilateral. On the right side the ROIs used to calculate the LIs are overlaid on red over a canonical MNI template. PSEN, Passive Listening to Pseudo Sentences; SEN, Passive Listening to Sentences; LMTLE, Left Temporal Lobe Epilepsy; RMTLE, Right Temporal Lobe Epilepsy; L, Left Hemisphere; R, Right Hemisphere. \n  \nThus, the LI ranges between 1 for extreme left lateralized activations and -1 for total right lateralization patterns. In other words, an LI greater than 0.4 means that at least 70% (following eq.\u00a01, 0.4\u2009=\u2009\n[ ]/100) of activation is left lateralized, while a LI below -0.4 implies that at least 70% of activation (-0.4\u2009=\u2009\n[ - ]/100) is in the right hemisphere. This criterion was the threshold selected to classify a pattern of activation as left or right lateralized with LIs between 0.4 and -0.4 being considered bilateral. LIs were derived using the bootstrapped method (in which no threshold needs to be specified as this particular algorithm is threshold-independent) of the LI-toolbox\n[ ], in which 10.000 LIs per subject were iteratively calculated at different thresholds using voxel values and clustering, yielding a robust LI. \n\nA one-way ANOVA on LIs was performed to check for a significant group effect (RMTLE, LMTLE, controls). Two sample   t  -tests were also calculated between pairs of groups to evaluate significant differences in their mean LI. LIs were also correlated with the age at epilepsy onset and all neuropsychological variables (for each group and pooling all the groups together) using Pearson's linear correlation. For significant correlations and trends, 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using 10.000 permutations. In this manner, if CIs are greater than zero, the probability of the correlation being non significant is reduced to 5%. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### fMRI results \n  \nTask vs. rest contrasts (SEN vs. rest, PSEN vs. rest) thresholded at   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 uncorrected with 20\u00a0voxels of cluster extent and elicited clear activations in the STG and MTG bilaterally in all patients and controls (42 subjects in total, see Figure\u00a0\n  and Tables\u00a0\n ,\n  and\n  for descriptions of each contrast of interest per group and Figure\u00a0\n  for single case examples).

The predominant pattern of activations was bilateral for controls (mean LI 0.03, 3 subjects left lateralized, 1 right dominant and 15 bilateral) and RMTLE patients (mean LI -0.10, 1 patient left lateralized, 1 right lateralized and 9 bilateral). LMTLE patients (6 patients with right hemispheric dominance and 6 bilateral) showed the most right lateralized pattern of activation (mean LI -0.32, 65% of activation in right temporal lobe) which was significantly more right lateralized than controls (  t  (29)\u2009=\u2009-2.87,   p  \u2009<\u20090.008). No significant differences were found between the mean LI of LMTLE and RMTLE patients (  t  (21)\u2009=\u2009-1.44,   p  \u2009>\u20090.16) or RMTLE patients and controls (  t  (28)\u2009=\u2009-0.98, p\u2009>\u20090.33). Correlations between LIs for this contrast and age at epilepsy onset for the RMTLE patients were not significant (  r  \u2009=\u2009-0.15,   p  \u2009>\u20090.65). However, for the LMTLE group a small trend was observed (  r   =0.40,   p  \u2009>\u20090.19, bootstrapped CIs -0.20/0.88). No other significant correlations or marginal effects were found (all p\u2009>\u20090.20). \n\nOne-way ANOVA analysis on LIs in the PSEN vs. rest contrast also showed a significant group effect (  F  (2,39)\u2009=\u20094.67   p  \u2009<\u20090.015). For controls (mean LI -0.08, 1 subject with left hemispheric dominance, 3 right lateralized and 15 bilateral) and RMTLE patients (mean LI -0.16, 2 patients right lateralized and 9 bilateral) bilateral activation was commonly observed. LMTLE patients (6 patients with right hemispheric dominance and 6 bilateral) showed, once again, the most right lateralized pattern of activation (mean LI -0.41, 70% of the activation in the right temporal lobe) which was significantly more right lateralized than controls (  t  (29)\u2009=\u2009-3.03,   p  \u2009<\u20090.005) and RMTLE patients (  t  (21)\u2009=\u2009-2.18,   p  \u2009<\u20090.041). No significant differences were found between the mean LI of RMTLE patients and controls (  t  (28)\u2009=\u2009-0.73,   p  \u2009>\u20090.47). The correlation between LIs for the PSEN contrast and age at epilepsy onset for RMTLE patients was not significant (r\u2009=\u2009-0.1,   p  \u2009>\u20090.76), whereas for the LMTLE group a significant correlation was found (see Figure\u00a0\n ) (  r  \u2009=\u20090.63,   p  \u2009<\u20090.03, bootstrapped CIs 0.16/0.93). No other significant correlations were found (all p\u2009>\u20090.20). \n  \nOn the left side, LIs correlation for the PSEN vs. rest of LMTLE patients and their epilepsy onset age (r\u2009=\u20090.63, p\u2009<\u20090.03). \n  \n\n### Individual cases of interest \n  \nIn order to illustrate the results, Figure\u00a0\n  shows the main activations for SEN vs. rest and PSEN vs. rest contrasts for three representative patients. To emphasize the strength of the activations found in the temporal lobe at the subject-level, an FDR-corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 threshold with 20\u00a0voxels of spatial extent was used to show the activations in these particular three subjects. Figure\u00a0\n A shows the results of Patient 9, a 63\u00a0year old woman suffering from LMTLE with an early epilepsy debut (3\u00a0years), showing a strongly right lateralized activation pattern in both PSEN (LI -0.65, 82.5% of activation in the right temporal lobe) and SEN conditions (LI -0.77, 88.5% of activation in the right temporal lobe). Figure\u00a0\n B shows the results of Patient 14, a 23\u00a0year old man suffering RMTLE with early epilepsy debut (0.66\u00a0years), showing bilateral (slightly left lateralized) activation in both PSEN (LI 0.19, 59.5% of activation in the left temporal lobe) and SEN conditions (LI 0.35, 67.5% of activation in the left temporal lobe). Figure\u00a0\n C shows the results of Patient 27, a 48\u00a0year old woman suffering LMTLE with late epilepsy debut (32\u00a0years), showing bilateral activation in both PSEN (LI 0.14, 57% of activation in the left temporal lobe) and SEN conditions (LI 0.27, 63.5% of activation in the left temporal lobe). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn line with previous intracarotid amobarbital procedure data and consistent with our findings, several fMRI studies have suggested that atypical dominance patterns are more frequent in epileptic patients\n[ , , , ] and may predominate in patients with epilepsy of left hemispheric origin\n[ , , ]. A previous study\n[ ] showed that 24% of LMTLE patients with HS had atypical language dominance and more importantly that this atypical language representation was associated with both a higher frequency of interictal discharges and with sensory auras representing seizure propagation to lateral temporal structures. It has been suggested that propagation of seizures from the epileptic focus to different brain regions triggers cortical plasticity not only around the focus but also in remote areas either ipsilateral or contralateral to the epileptic focus\n[ , , , , ]. It would therefore appear that the language network is particularly vulnerable to chronic epileptic activity. Moreover, an inter-hemispheric dissociation of frontal and temporal language regions in patients with focal epilepsy has also been described\n[ , , , - ]. In a previous study, 29 (20.1%) out of 144 patients with medically intractable complex-partial seizures showed bilateral language representation after intracarotid amobarbital test assessment\n[ ] and more importantly, 4 (2.8%) of these patients -2 of them with TLE- had strong evidence of an interhemispheric dissociation of expressive and receptive language functions. These findings have been posteriorly confirmed by several functional neuroimaging studies\n[ , , - ], which all support the hypothesis that reorganization can affect frontal and temporal language areas differently in patients with atypical language patterns. \n\nParadigms used for clinical language mapping vary greatly in different centres and no accepted standardized technique exists. Most fMRI language dominance studies in epileptic patients have used active language tasks\n[ - ]. However, imaging studies have confirmed that the laterality indexes yielded by receptive language paradigms can be as lateralized as those of active tasks\n[ , , - ]. In this way, and similarly to other passive listening semantic paradigms used on TLE patients\n[ , , ], we show how passive contrasts such as listening to SENs or PSENs versus baseline are able to unravel and clarify atypical language patterns in LMTLE patients. Mean LI was significantly more right lateralized for LMTLE patients than controls when listening to SENs and again more right lateralized for LMTLE than for both controls and RMTLE patients when listening to PSENs (see Figure\u00a0\n  and Table\u00a0\n ). While LI was mainly bilateral for the controls (79% of subjects for both SEN and PSEN conditions) and for RMTLE patients (81.8% of patients, for both SEN vs. rest and PSEN vs. rest conditions), 6 out of 12 patients of the LMTLE group showed a right lateralized activation for both contrasts (50% of patients). \n\nIt is important to note that this passive listening task is very easy and rapid to perform (only 6\u00a0minutes of fMRI acquisition) and that both task-rest contrasts produced robust activations of the temporal lobe for every one of the 42 participants studied. Interestingly, the SEN vs. PSEN contrast failed to elicit robust responses in 42% of LMTLE patients and controls and in 36% of RMTLE patients. These results are consistent with other passive paradigms using direct speech contrast between two active conditions, which also failed to show significant activations in several subjects. In a previous study\n[ ], a direct contrast between two active conditions (Listening Stories vs. Listening Reversed Stories) produced no significant activation in 22% of RMTLE and LMTLE patients and 12% of healthy subjects. Interestingly, in another study\n[ ], activation in 100% of subjects failed to reach significance in the direct contrast between two active conditions (listening to Words, Pseudowords and Reversed Speech). \n\nIn accordance with the present results, there is extensive functional imaging data suggesting that language comprehension is subserved by a large cortical network involving both temporal cortices\n[ - ]. Many neuroimaging studies reveal weak neural activity in the right hemisphere in the anatomically equivalent areas to those of the left hemisphere which show a strong signal during language tasks\n[ , ]. Additionally, some patients with right brain damage have deficits in comprehending natural language\n[ ]. All these data support the idea that although the left hemisphere plays a crucial role in language processing, the right hemisphere also contributes to language comprehension\n[ , , , , ]. Hence, the bilateral pattern of temporal lobe activation in controls and MTLE patients using this passive semantic paradigm agrees with previous functional imaging data showing that the STG and MTG are activated bilaterally by both speech and complex non-speech sounds\n[ , , , , - ]. Even when the auditory stimuli is novel and no meaning extraction is possible (as in the PSEN condition) both the MTG and STG show enhanced activations\n[ , ]. In fact, some studies have shown that activation at the level of the auditory cortex is neither modulated by the semantic content (\"meaningfulness\") of stimuli nor by the type of cognitive task performed\n[ ]. Moreover, in a previous study\n[ ] Words, Pseudowords and Reversed Speech versus baseline bilaterally activated both temporal lobes, yielding less than 2\u00a0ml of volumetric difference in activation between hemispheres (the only contrast that showed a significant difference in activation in temporal lobes was Words vs. rest with an LI of 0.11, therefore showing a bilateral distribution). It is also well known that that using a baseline condition such as fixation or rest (as in the SEN vs. rest and PSEN vs. rest contrast) yields bilateral functional patterns and LI values around zero\n[ ]. There is also experimental and clinical evidence showing bilateral activation in conceptual processing\n[ ]. \n\nFurthermore, a significant correlation between LI and age at epilepsy onset was found for the PSEN condition versus baseline (LIs for SEN vs. rest contrast also yielded a trend). There is a gradual decline in the potential for plasticity with age\n[ , ], but no particular age after which plasticity becomes absolutely impossible\n[ ]. Visual inspection of patients with LMTLE and early onset clearly showed a right lateralized pattern (Figure\u00a0\n A), while subjects suffering from RMTLE or LMTLE with late epilepsy debut showed a more bilateral pattern (Figure\u00a0\n B and\n C, respectively). It is important to note that a correlation between age at epilepsy onset and LI has been previously described using a semantic decision task\n[ ]. This gives additional support to the usefulness of a simple passive language task like the one described in this study. \n\nPrevious studies using language fMRI with productive and receptive tasks have shown how in TLE patients with atypical language patterns, reorganization affected frontal and temporal language areas differently, with temporal LIs being more right lateralized than frontal ones\n[ , , , - ]. Moreover, data from lesion and neuroimaging studies suggests that comprehension or semantic activation -involving retrieval and selection of semantic information- depends on a wide cortical network, larger than Wernicke's or even Broca\u2019s area (which is required particularly for the correct processing of complex morphosyntactic structures)\n[ ]. Furthermore, there are several patient studies supporting the involvement of the anterior superior temporal lobe for sentence-level comprehension\n[ , , , ]. Semantic knowledge stores are diffusely located in ventral temporal (MTG, ITG, fusiform gyrus, temporal pole) and inferior parietal (angular gyrus) cortices, in addition to the classic posterior STG and planum temporale\n[ , , , , , ]. Therefore, as both the ventral and anterior temporal lobes are related to receptive language and TLE surgery (ATL) commonly involves the resection of these regions of the temporal lobe, we hypothesize that the passive semantic paradigm presented here -which mainly activates temporal lobe structures- is more precise in predicting semantic language defects, such as naming retrieval or verbal memory decline, in TLE patients who undergo surgery\n[ , , - ]. In addition, this paradigm may also provide important information about the extent of functional reserves in the contralateral hemisphere\n[ ] and might be helpful in tailoring the resection of temporal lesions with the aim of preserving eloquent areas of the brain. We cannot omit however that a limitation of this study is the lack of comparison to other laterality measurements yielded by more classical non-passive language paradigms. Also, a larger sample of patients might have allowed us to compute a more detailed analysis of the LIs within the temporal lobes by dividing the MTL into different sections (i.e., anterior/posterior). \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn summary, the simple, rapid, non-collaboration dependent, passive task described in this study produces a robust activation in the temporal lobe in both TLE patients and controls and illustrates a pattern of atypical language organization specifically in LMTLE patients. \n\n### Financial disclosure statement and acknowledgments \n  \nThis research has been supported by a predoctoral grant from the Spanish Government (FPU program AP2010-4179) to P.R., a predoctoral grant from Generalitat de Catalunya to D.L-B.

In this fMRI study we investigated affective touch by exploring its effects on overt behavior. Arm and palm skin were stroked with a soft brush at five different velocities (0.3, 1, 10, 3, and 30 cm s ), using a novel feedback-based paradigm. Following stimulation in each trial, participants actively chose whether the caress they would receive in the next trial would be the same speed (\u201crepeat\u201d) or different (\u201cchange\u201d). Since preferred stroking speeds should be sought with greater frequency than non-preferred speeds, this paradigm provided a measure of such preferences in the form of active choices. The stimulation velocities were implemented with respect to the differential subjective pleasantness ratings they elicit in healthy subjects, with intermediate velocities (1, 10, and 3 cm s ) considered more pleasant than very slow or very fast ones. Such pleasantness ratings linearly correlate with changes in mean firing rates of unmyelinated low-threshold C-tactile (CT) afferent nerves in the skin. Here, gentle, dynamic stimulation optimal for activating CT-afferents not only affected behavioral choices, but engaged brain regions involved in reward-related behavior and decision-making. This was the case for both hairy skin of the arm, where CTs are abundant, and glabrous skin of the palm, where CTs are absent. These findings provide insights on central and behavioral mechanisms underlying the perception of affective touch, and indicate that seeking affective touch involves value-based neural processing that is ultimately reflected in behavioral preferences. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAffective touch is an emotional form of social interaction, and the only one that relies on bodily contact. Its importance for social connection and well-being is essential from infancy onward (Hertenstein and Campos,  ; Muir,  ; Hertenstein et al.,  ; Ardiel and Rankin,  ; Morrison et al.,  ; Fairhurst et al.,  ). However, little is known about the neural mechanisms by which affective touch affects behavior in social interactions. In this study we ask whether affective touch informs overt behavioral choices, and if so, what are the neural correlates underlying the evaluations and decisions driving such behavior. \n\nThe hedonics of human touch and associated behavior are complex. On the psychological and behavioral levels, interpersonal touch interactions can be driven by different motivations\u2014for example, to comfort or be comforted, to initiate intimacy, or to communicate emotions. On the cortical level, motivational and hedonic components of touch may interact, making it difficult to disentangle the hedonic appreciation of social touch from the motivational impetus to seek it. Finally, on the level of subjective experience, hedonic representations originating in different parts of tactile, motivational, reward, and other systems may give rise to unitary percepts, which do not necessarily decompose readily into distinct subcomponents in the lab. \n\nWhat are the candidate neural pathways that may influence the hedonic evaluation of touch and, ultimately, overt behavioral choices? Recent evidence suggests that unmyelinated C-tactile (CT) afferent nerve fibers in human skin convey signals related to the hedonic value of a soft caress (Vallbo et al.,  ; Olausson et al.,  ; Wessberg et al.,  ; L\u00f6ken et al.,  ; Morrison,  ). CTs are found only in hairy (e.g., arm) but not glabrous (e.g., palm) skin. They show a unique tuning to a narrow range of caressing speeds of about 1\u201310 cm s , peaking at about 3 cm s  (L\u00f6ken et al.,  ). Crucially, mean CT firing frequency during caress stimulation correlates with pleasantness ratings (L\u00f6ken et al.,  ). CT firing frequency also increases during skin-temperature stroking (32\u00b0C), compared to cooler and warmer temperatures, further suggesting a socially-relevant function (Ackerley et al.,  ). Further, selective activation of a mouse homolog of low-threshold, unmyelinated CT afferents can alter a mouse\u2019s behavioral preferences (Vrontou et al.,  ). \n\nWith this candidate pathway as a starting point, we therefore hypothesized that stroking participants\u2019 skin at different speeds (0.3, 1, 10, 3, and 30 cm s ) and on different skin types (hairy and glabrous) would differentially affect their hedonic evaluation and preferences, and give rise to different patterns of behavioral and neural activation. These speed and location conditions were therefore incorporated in a novel paradigm designed to characterize hedonic evaluation in terms of its impact on behavioral choices for both hairy and glabrous skin. The feedback-based paradigm allowed participants to choose the speed of gentle brushing stimulation they received. In each trial, the subject received brush strokes on the forearm (hairy skin) or palm (glabrous skin) at one of the five different speeds. After each trial, participants indicated by button-press whether they would rather receive the same stroking speed again (\u201crepeat\u201d) or change to another one, randomly selected by the computer (\u201cchange\u201d). This was designed to approximate everyday interpersonal touch behavior, in which individuals decide to seek a specific touch stimulus, perhaps based on experience or past evaluations. \n\nThis paradigm allowed us to capture four main aspects of dynamic and affective tactile stimulation. First, we explored general activation during dynamic touch stroking, regardless of stimulation speed, skin surface, and behavioral outcome. Second, we explored the evaluation of this stimulation with respect to a behavioral decision, by examining all activation following stroking but preceding an active behavioral choice. To discover signal increases for repeat vs. change choices, we compared these conditions within the evaluation period. Within this evaluation period we also targeted cerebral activation increases to preferred touch stimulation speeds. Finally, we investigated the neural correlates of specific behavioral preferences by examining preferred vs. non-preferred speeds on arm and palm. In this way we were able to explore aspects of affective touch stimulation not only with respect to stimulus processing, but also to how evaluation of such stimulation influences hedonic preferences and overt behavioral choices. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nEighteen neurologically healthy subjects, recruited from the University of Gothenburg participated in the study (age 20\u201332, 9 males). The procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the University of Gothenburg, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants gave informed consent and were compensated at 200 Swedish crowns (22 Euro) per session. \n\n\n### Stimuli and design \n  \nStimuli consisted of single brush strokes over 5 cm of left forearm or palm skin using a soft 70 mm-wide goat hair artist\u2019s brush, brushing in a distal to proximal direction. Brush strokes were delivered manually at 5 different velocities: 0.3 cm s , 1 cm s , 3 cm s , 10 cm s , and 30 cm s . Presentation of the initial velocity was random, and after the first trial subjects could choose the velocity presented in the next trial by pressing one of two buttons with their right hand, indicating whether to repeat the previous velocity (\u201crepeat\u201d) or to change to a new velocity randomly selected by the computer program (\u201cchange\u201d). \n\nEach trial began with a 2 s inter-trial interval during which subjects fixated their gaze on a dot presented centrally on the screen. There followed a stimulation interval lasting between 2 and 16 s, depending on the velocity delivered. A 1 s interval occurred between stimulation and the onset of the response cue. The response cue consisted of the sentence \u201cRepeat or Change?\u201d remaining on the screen for 3 s as the subjects pressed the button indicating their choice (Figure  ). \n  \n Design  . Each trial began with a 2 s inter-trial interval during which subjects fixated their gaze on a dot presented centrally on the screen. There followed a 2\u201316 s stimulation interval, depending on the velocity delivered. Participants received single brush strokes on the arm at different velocities. Stimulation consisted of single brush strokes delivered manually on 5 cm of the arm or the palm. A 1 s interval occurred between stimulation and the onset of the response cue. The response cue consisted of the sentence \u201cRepeat or change?\u201d remaining on the screen for 3 s as the subjects pressed the button indicating their choice. \n  \nThe experimental design was a 2 \u00d7 5 factorial with the factors location (arm, palm) and velocity (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 cm s ). Data were collected in two runs during one scanning session, with arm and palm stimuli presented in separate runs to avoid movement artifacts associated with turning the arm to and from a pronated position. Run order was counterbalanced across subjects. Importantly, since the design was feedback-based, the number of trials and volumes per run varied between subjects. To counteract \u201cshift\u201d biases while ensuring a minimum number of stimulations per velocity for all participants, each velocity was presented a baseline minimum of 6 times over the whole run. To counteract \u201cstay\u201d biases, the program automatically changed to a different randomly selected velocity after two consecutive repeats. The subjects were aware that they would receive a maximum of three trials of the same velocity in a row. \n\nResponse mapping on the button box was counterbalanced across subjects to avoid spatial confounds (i.e., \u201crepeat\u201d or \u201cchange\u201d with index or middle finger). The experimenter (I.P.) was trained in the delivery of the stimuli, and during the experiment was guided by a visual meter with a moving stripe representing the velocity and distance in each trial. Visual cues to the participant were projected onto a screen positioned near the participants\u2019 feet, visible through mirrors affixed to the head coil. Occluders were placed on the mirror to ensure that participants\u2019 field of view was limited to the screen and did not include the stimulated limb or the experimenter. Each run began and ended with a fixation period of 45 s to allow a return to baseline. \n\n\n### FMRI data acquisition \n  \nA 1.5 T Philips Intera magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner with a SENSE head coil was used. For functional imaging, a single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence was used (T2*-weighted, gradient echo sequence, repetition time (TR) = 3000, echo time = 50 ms, flip angle = 90\u00ba, field-of-view (FOV) 230 mm). The scanned area included 30 axial slices, 5 mm thick, with no gap, at 64 \u00d7 64 voxel in-plane resolution, which covered the whole cerebral cortex and the cerebellum. To minimize head movement, participants\u2019 heads were stabilized with a vacuum hood filled with polystyrene balls (Vacuform Hood, Cambridge Research Systems, Cambridge, UK). \n\n\n### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nBehavioral data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To obtain a measure of preference per velocity, the mean ratios of the number of repeats for all active choices (total number of repeats plus total number of changes) for each velocity were converted to percentage values. A chance cutoff of 45% (  p   < 0.05) was imposed based on the binomial distribution of the responses. Therefore velocities for which the subjects showed an above-chance mean of >45% selection of \u201crepeat\u201d over \u201cchange\u201d responses were taken to indicate a positive preference for brush stroking stimulation at that velocity; those <45% were taken to indicate no preference or negative preference. \n\nTo investigate effects of stroking velocity and location, percentage values were then submitted into a 2 \u00d7 5 factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) with factors location (arm, palm) and velocity (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 cm s ). Further analysis was conducted to assess the curve of the percentage value pattern across velocities to and address potential similarities with the pleasantness\u2019 rating pattern across velocities (L\u00f6ken et al.,  ). To investigate this aspect, regression analyses were performed on arm and palm percentage rating values separately. The factor velocity was used as independent variable, logarithm-transformed and entered as linear and quadratic terms in a regression model. In addition, the shapes of the resulting regressions for arm and palm were statistically compared by performing a linear mixed model in which both arm and palm ratings were taken into account. \n\n\n### FMRI data analysis \n  \nPreprocessing and statistical analysis of MRI data were performed using BrainVoyager QX (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands) and exploratory ROIs analysis (Poldrack,  ) was performed with SPSS. Three dummy volumes were acquired before each scan in order to reduce possible effects of T1 saturation. Functional data were motion corrected and low-frequency drifts were removed with a temporal high-pass filter (0.006 Hz). Spatial smoothing was applied with a 6 mm full width at half-maximum filter. Functional data were manually co-registered with 3-dimensional (3D) anatomical T1 scans (1 \u00d7 1.58 \u00d7 1.58 mm resolution resampled to 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm), on the basis of anatomical landmarks for each individual. The 3D anatomical scans were transformed into Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux,  ), and the parameters for this transformation were subsequently applied to the coregistered functional data. \n\nSix out of 36 runs from a total of six participants were discarded due to excessive head-motion during the experiment (>2 mm). For each participant, three different general linear models (GLMs) were created for each of the 2 runs: \u201cStimulation interval\u201d capturing activation during the brush stroking on the skin; \u201cEvaluation interval\u201d capturing post-stimulus processing; skin stimulation and \u201cPreference ratio\u201d capturing behavioral preference across velocities for arm and palm. \n\n\n### GLM 1: stimulation interval \n  \nTwo predictors modeled the intervals corresponding to the tactile stimulation period in each trial. One predictor (\u201crepeat\u201d) included all trials in which the participant selected \u201crepeat.\u201d The other predictor (\u201cchange\u201d) included all trials in which the participant selected \u201cchange\u201d. To investigate BOLD signal changes following tactile stimulation, a whole-brain contrast compared all stimulation intervals vs. a fixation baseline (all inter-trial intervals) for both arm and palm. Repeat vs. baseline and change vs. baseline contrasts were also used to address potential differences between arm and palm tactile processing. Whole-brain random effects contrasts were corrected for multiple comparisons using BrainVoyager\u2019s cluster threshold estimator plug-in, which uses a Monte Carlo simulation procedure (1,000 iterations) to establish the critical cluster size threshold corresponding to a family-wise alpha of 0.05 corrected for the whole brain (Forman et al.,  ; Goebel et al.,  ). \n\n\n### GLM 2: evaluation interval \n  \nIn this model, two predictors modeled the 1 s interval after tactile stimulation and before button response, during which the subject was preparing to select \u201crepeat\u201d or \u201cchange\u201d. This interval captured evaluative processing that is geared towards an overt decision. One predictor for this interval (\u201crepeat\u201d) included all trials in which the participant chose \u201crepeat\u201d. The other predictor for this interval (\u201cchange\u201d) included all trials in which the participant chose \u201cchange\u201d. Whole brain contrasts between repeat and fixation baseline and a contrast between repeat and change were also performed. Whole-brain random effects contrasts were corrected for multiple comparisons using BrainVoyager\u2019s cluster threshold estimator plug-in, corresponding to a family-wise alpha of 0.05 corrected for the whole brain. \n\n\n### GLM 3: preference ratio \n  \nTo reveal which areas represented the behavioral preferences across all five velocities, thus likely reflecting any differential weighting across velocities, a whole-brain search was conducted based on the participants\u2019 individual behavioral ratios of repeat-to-change choices (see Section Behavioral data analysis above). As in the \u201cEvaluation\u201d GLM, each predictor modeled the 1 s interval between stimulus and choice. However in this model, ten predictors were created for each of the 10 conditions (0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 cm s  for arm; 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 cm s  for palm). Because the number of trials per condition was variable across subjects due to the feedback-based nature of the design, a baseline of the first 6 trials per condition was used to define the predictors for the whole-brain, group average analysis. Using the first trials for each velocity also avoids potential confounds associated with repetition of the same trial type (i.e., none followed a \u201crepeat\u201d choice). Whole-brain random effect contrasts were performed at an uncorrected threshold of   p   < 0.005. We performed a whole-brain search for areas showing higher hemodynamic responses following velocities in which the proportion of \u201crepeats\u201d to \u201cchanges\u201d was above a \u201cpreference\u201d cutoff, based on the group\u2019s binomial distribution of \u201drepeat\u201d choices, in which chance was at 45% with a   p   of 0.05; see Section Behavioral data analysis above). Velocities with above-chance percentages were weighted positively and those below chance weighted negatively. Based on the behavioral responses we used the contrast [(1 + 3 + 10) cm s  > (0.3 + 30) cm s ] for the arm trials and [(3 cm s  ) > (0.3 + 1 + 10 + 30) cm s ] for the palm trials. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavior \n  \n#### Hedonic preference for touch depends on the speed of stroking \n  \nThe total number of trials varied from 36 to 83 for the different subjects. For the arm, the binomial distribution of responses (i.e., mean repeat vs. total choice percentages) exceeded chance (45%) for 1, 3, and 10 cm s  (Figure  ). For the palm, the repeat percentages exceeding chance was only for 3 cm s . The percentage values for each velocity for arm were (from slowest to fastest velocities, mean \u00b1 SD): 36.1 \u00b1 31.4, 56.1 \u00b1 29.1, 57.4 \u00b1 23.5, 45.9 \u00b1 23.7, 30.7 \u00b1 30.2. For palm were (from slowest to fastest velocities, mean \u00b1 SD): 32.4 \u00b1 28.7, 40.6 \u00b1 26.3, 58.8 \u00b1 23.3, 37.9 \u00b1 26.9, 29.8 \u00b1 34.1. \n  \n (A)   The two graphs represent the percentage of the ratio of repeats on overall choices for arm (black) and palm (gray). For the arm, ratio values exceeded chance (45%) for 1, 3, and 10 cm s  whereas for the palm, the repeat percentages exceeding chance was only for 3 cm s . Both curves were significantly best described by a negative quadratic term.   (B)   Activation maps for GLM3: Preference ratio, reflecting differential weighting across velocities. To represent the behavioral ratio the following contrast was used: [(1 cm s  + 3 cm s  + 10 cm s ) > (0.3 cm s  + 30 cm s )] for the arm trials vs. [(3 cm s ) > (0.3 cm s  + 1 cm s  + 10 cm s  + 30 cm s )] for the palm. This contrast reveals clusters with higher responses for 1, 3, and 10 compared to 0.3 and 30 s  in the arm conditions; and 3 compared to 0.3, 1, 10 and 30 s  in the palm conditions. Both arm and palm runs were included in the general linear model. Results revealed activation in right dlPFC (35, 39, 6) and right posterior insula (29, \u221226, 9). All contrasts thresholded at a whole-brain uncorrected level of   p   < 0.005. Talairach coordinates, radiological convention (left is right). \n  \nThe mean repeat vs. total choice percentages were submitted to a 2 \u00d7 5 repeated-measures ANOVA with 2 within-subject factors: location (arm or palm) and velocity (0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 30 cm s ). A significant main effect of velocity was seen,   F   = 5.482,   p   = 0.006 (Greenhouse-Geisser).

(PI = Posterior Insula, PFC = Prefrontal Cortex)  . \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nGentle, dynamic stimulation optimal for activating CT afferents influenced behavioral preferences and engaged brain regions involved in reward-related evaluation and decision-making. This was the case for both hairy skin of the arm, where CTs are abundant, and glabrous skin of the palm, where CTs are absent. The experiment\u2019s novel feedback-based paradigm was designed not only to capture relationships between tactile processing and behavioral preferences, but also to disambiguate the key hedonic components of \u201cliking\u201d and \u201cwanting\u201d (Berridge and Robinson,  ). \u201cLiking\u201d refers to the estimation of the positive value of a stimulus, whereas \u201cwanting\u201d reflects the impact on behavior following reward-driven changes in motivational states. Together these components guide motivated choices (Berridge and Robinson,  ) and provide impetus to seeking behavior (Panksepp,  ). \n\nPrevious affective touch experiments have relied on visual analog scales (VASs) to provide subjective measures of hedonic evaluation. Such rating measures correspond to \u201cliking\u201d the stimulus. Choosing to repeat a stimulus more closely taps into \u201cwanting\u201d. Consistent with VAS ratings across stroking speeds for hairy forearm skin (L\u00f6ken et al.,  ; Morrison et al.,  , ), participants chose intermediate, CT-optimal velocities (1\u201310 cm s ) with above-chance frequency for arm stimulation, but not the very slow or very fast speeds less likely to activate CTs (0.3 and 30 cm s ). This corroborates the previous VAS evaluations, but using an orthogonal measure that does not rely on explicit semantic labeling of the stimulus as \u201cpleasant.\u201d In the palm skin, which lacks CT afferents, only 3 cm s  stroking was selected with above-chance frequency, suggesting a narrower range of hedonic preference in glabrous skin. The behavioral results supported the hypothesis that the positive valence of affective touch also carries motivational value. \n\n### Stimulation interval \n  \nOn the level of the brain, any hedonic evaluation of touch is based on processing of its properties during stimulation. Here, all tactile stimulation (both preferred and non-preferred) activated contralateral PI and SII for both arm and palm, compared to a fixation baseline. PI activation is consistent with previous studies of selective CT stimulation (Olausson et al.,  ). Converging evidence indicates that this region is an early cortical target for an afferent pathway including CTs (Olausson et al.,  ; Craig,  ). This area is associated with somatosensory processing and is highly interconnected with somatosensory networks (Augustine,  ). Functional and connectivity evidence indicates that sensory information may be integrated in a caudo-rostral fashion within the insula (Kurth et al.,  ; Cerliani et al.,  ). The PI\u2019s contribution to somatosensation may lie in its dense inputs from spinothalamic pathways (Dum et al.,  ), strongly implicated in \u201cinteroceptive\u201d representation, as well as its connections with anterior insula (Craig,  ,  ; Bj\u00f6rnsdotter et al.,  ,  ; Morrison et al.,  ). \n\nThe engagement of somatosensory cortices, particularly for palm stimulation, is consistent with discriminative encoding, with a predominant contribution from large, fast-conducting A\u00df tactile afferent pathways (Trulsson et al.,  ; McGlone et al.,  ; Kandel et al.,  ). Most tactile input from A\u00df afferents in the skin follows a pathway with terminations in somatosensory cortices, associated with high-acuity stimulus discrimination. \n\nPI and somatosensory cortices were activated for both arm and palm stroking. However, preferred arm stroking was limited to PI whereas preferred stroking on the palm also engaged parietal primary and secondary somatosensory areas (Figure  ; see also McGlone et al.,   for similar arm-palm differences). Together with the palm-specific activation in SI, this incomplete overlap between arm and palm stroking activation suggests a general bias towards arm (CT + A\u03b2 input) in PI, alongside a bias towards palm (A\u03b2 input) in somatosensory cortices. This difference in bias for arm and palm activation, with arm responses limited to PI, suggests that the PI may be sufficient for coding hedonic touch in hairy skin. The additional engagement of discriminatory areas by palm stroking could reflect a partially distinct contribution to hedonic processing (Pleger et al.,  ; Gazzola et al.,  ; McGlone et al.,  ). It also indicates that different skin types involve different, yet related, processing on the cortical level. \n\n\n### Evaluation interval \n  \nAfter stimulation and before the button-response cue, there was a 1 s interval during which participants prepared to choose \u201crepeat\u201d or \u201cchange.\u201d During this evaluation interval there was strong bilateral activation of anterior insula, regardless of stroking speed or behavioral choice. This supports the idea of anterior insula as a hub of complex interoceptive processing for implementation of appropriate behavior (Craig,  ). It also highlights the importance of subjective internal states before decisions and related behavioral outcomes (Paulus,  ; Lovero et al.,  ; No\u00ebl et al.,  ). Anterior insula activation was independent of repeat or change choices, yet differentiated between arm and palm stimulation. Specifically, activation for arm-related signal changes was centered in contralateral anterior insula whereas the palm activation was centered more ventrally in inferior frontal gyrus (Figure  ). \n\nThe areas showing selective activation for repeats vs. changes were in the precentral gyrus, left dlPFC and the head of the caudate. The caudate is associated with goal-directed behavior and reward expectancy (Kawagoe et al.,  ; Schultz,  ; Kable and Glimcher,  ; Lau and Glimcher,  ; Pleger et al.,  ). It also plays a fundamental role in the preparation of movements that lead to a rewarding outcome (Hollerman et al.,  ) and in behavioral learning (Haruno et al.,  ). Specific \u201crepeat\u201d-related activation in the caudate is consistent with its engagement in reward-related behavior. This activation provides evidence that striatal, reward-related regions participate in the evaluation of a specific tactile stimulus. \n\n\n### Preference ratio \n  \nParticipants preferred arm stroking at 1, 3, and 10 cm s , and palm stroking at 3 cm s , choosing to repeat rather than change away from these speeds significantly more often. The percentage of repeat to change trials for each stroking speed formed a binomial distribution, and speeds which fell above this distribution\u2019s chance-level likelihood of choosing \u201crepeat\u201d were considered preferred stimuli. All preferred vs. non-preferred speeds regardless of skin type activated PI and dlPFC. Because this contrast was based on a ratio of repeats to changes for each participant, it captured processing in regions that take   both   preferred and non-preferred stimuli into account. The PI and dlPFC activations therefore suggest that these areas are involved in value-based choices reflecting preferences among tactile brush strokes at different stimulation speeds. \n\nThere was no statistical difference in insular BOLD activation between caress stimulation on the arm compared to the palm, indicating a broad velocity-sensitivity without selectivity for skin type or body part. This is consistent with evidence that the PI is speed-sensitive even when simply viewing others\u2019 stroking (Olausson et al.,  ; Morrison et al.,  ). \n\nThe dlPFC has been implicated in both decision-making (Pochon et al.,  ; Krain et al.,  ) and reward-related processes (Leon and Shadlen,  ; Pochon et al.,  ; Tanaka et al.,  ; Ahn et al.,  ). It is also involved in the integration of information about the outcome of previous decisions with estimations of the expected reward value of future stimuli (Barraclough et al.,  ). Here, dlPFC may have been involved in maintaining information about the relative value of the available stroking options in order to make an optimal choice (Christakou et al.,  ). Indeed, whereas neurons in macaque orbitalfrontal cortex (OFC) code the actual reward value of a reinforcer, dlPFC neurons are more related to producing the correct behavioral choice required to get a reward (Wallis and Miller,  ; Wallis,  ). In this perspective dlPFC reflects prospective processing by modulating behavior according to previous experiences. \n\nThis reward-choice component in our study may be especially salient for the arm. The dlPFC activation, which fell near the coordinates reported by Gordon et al. ( ) and Bennett et al. ( ) for CT-targeted touch was significantly more activated for arm than palm stroking (main effect of arm stimulation). This is consistent with prefrontal regions\u2019 preferential activation during tactile stimulation for arm vs. palm (McGlone et al.,  ; Gordon et al.,  ) and on the general role of dlPFC in motivated decision-making, including in the tactile domain (Levy and Glimcher,  ). Previous studies have shown that dlPFC is more activated during soft tactile stimulation on arm compared to palm (Voos et al.,  ; Bennett et al.,  ), and is temporally synchronized with amygdala activation during stroking stimulation (Gordon et al.,  ). Considering its co-activation with PI (a major target for CT projections), the dlPFC may contribute to a differential hedonic weighting of the stimulus with a dependence on skin type. dlPFC, alongside insula, may represent different hedonic weights across velocities, with PI broadly tuned to stroking velocity on both arm and palm, and the dlPFC more sensitive to skin-type-dependent factors in preference determination (Bennett et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Arm and palm \n  \nThe arm-palm similarities and differences that we found in this experiment may shed light on distinct and complementary cortical pathways of affective touch and their possible relationship to behavioral preferences. First of all, these findings suggest a degree of similarity between hairy skin, innervated by both CTs and A\u00dfs (arm) and glabrous skin, innervated by A\u00dfs (palm). The repeat-to-change ratios for both arm and palm followed an inverse U-shaped pattern, best described by a negative quadratic regressor (L\u00f6ken et al.,  ; Morrison et al.,  ). \n\nArm and palm stimulation and post-stimulus evaluation also activated PI and somatosensory cortices. These regions receive mixed input from both unmyelinated CT afferent pathways and discriminative tactile pathways, with predominant discriminative inputs to somatosensory cortices. Speed of stroking is a crucial feature of touch pleasantness when it comes to tactile stimulation on the hairy skin, where CT fibers are present. However, we found no significant BOLD differences for preferred speeds for arm and palm, which suggests that CT optimal stroking speeds are processed nonspecifically for both glabrous and hairy skin. So far, the CT afferent pathway has been the only afferent system observed to have a unique relationship with both stroking speed and perceived pleasantness (L\u00f6ken et al.,  ; Ackerley et al.,  ), making it the prime candidate for mediating tactile processing in these specific affective terms. Yet despite having a less different speed-tuning at the afferent level, the A\u00df afferents that innervate both glabrous and hairy skin may also enable affective evaluation and provide an impetus to behavioral choices by virtue of their projections to interrelated cortical networks. The respective contributions of arm and palm stimulation to hedonic processing and behavior may become more apparent at a finer grain than the broad categories of \u201cliking\u201d and \u201cwanting\u201d currently allow. In real, ecological human affective touch interactions, arm and palm play different but complementary roles. The palm is an active \u201ctouch-seeking\u201d surface used to stroke another person\u2019s skin, and the speed of stroking should correspond to the speed that feels good to the recipient. This suggests hypotheses for future experiments involving affective evaluation not only in \u201cstrokees\u201d but \u201cstrokers\u201d as well (Ackerley et al.,  ; Ebisch et al.,  ). Given that there may be perceptual differences between arm and palm perception that yet have to be fully understood (McGlone et al.,  ), we suggest that the CT pathway to cortex might offer a first-pass filter from which cortical evaluative processing from glabrous skin stimulation can draw information. The activation in the caudate and dlPFC for preferred velocities indicates that slow skin stroking is not only perceived as desirable, but it might also represent a channel for the driving and regulation of behavior during affiliative touch interactions. \n\n\n\n## Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nBrain region/contrast\tPeak coordinates (Talairach)\tMaximum t-score\tCluster size (mm3)\nAll stimulation vs. baseline\t\t\t\nRight SII/PI\t38, \u221214, 12\t8.82\t8287.0\nRight MI\t53, \u22122, 33\t6.07\t446.0\nRight SI\t29, \u221238, 54\t6.08\t259.0\nRepeat vs. change\t\t\t\nLeft dorsolateral PFC (BA9)\t\u22121, 40, 33\t5.72\t150.0\nRepeat vs. baseline (arm only)\t\t\t\nRight PI\t41, \u221220, 15\t5.86\t923.0\nRepeat vs. baseline (palm only)\t\t\t\nRight SI\t56, \u221220, 36\t6.83\t944.0\nRight SII/PI\t47, \u221223, 21\t5.61\t2919.0\n### Caption\nActivation during \u201cstimulation interval\u201d.\n### Footer\nAll contrasts thresholded at p < 0.001, cluster-size corrected at p < 0.05.

{"text": "Barker, Daphne and Plack, Christopher J. and Hall, Deborah A.\nFront Syst Neurosci, 2013\n\n# Title\n\nRepresentations of pitch and slow modulation in auditory cortex\n\n# Keywords\n\npitch\niterated ripple noise\nIRN\nplanum temporale\nHeschl's gyrus\nspectro-temporal modulation\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nIterated ripple noise (IRN) is a type of pitch-evoking stimulus that is commonly used in neuroimaging studies of pitch processing. When contrasted with a spectrally matched Gaussian noise, it is known to produce a consistent response in a region of auditory cortex that includes an area antero-lateral to the primary auditory fields (lateral Heschl's gyrus). The IRN-related response has often been attributed to pitch, although recent evidence suggests that it is more likely driven by slowly varying spectro-temporal modulations not related to pitch. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study showed that both pitch-related temporal regularity and slow modulations elicited a significantly greater response than a baseline Gaussian noise in an area that has been pre-defined as pitch-responsive. The region was sensitive to both pitch salience and slow modulation salience. The responses to pitch and spectro-temporal modulations interacted in a saturating manner, suggesting that there may be an overlap in the populations of neurons coding these features. However, the interaction may have been influenced by the fact that the two pitch stimuli used (IRN and unresolved harmonic complexes) differed in terms of pitch salience. Finally, the results support previous findings suggesting that the cortical response to IRN is driven in part by slow modulations, not by pitch. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPitch is the sensation whose variation is associated with musical melodies. It is arguably the most important perceptual feature of music and is one of the main cues in speech and in sound segregation. There are many different physical features that can elicit the same pitch percept. For example, although a middle C played on the piano sounds very different to a middle C played on the guitar or sung, it is still recognized as the same note. It is this phenomenon that has led auditory scientists to postulate the existence of a \u201cpitch center\u201d\u2014a region of auditory cortex responsible for representing pitch, regardless of the physical attributes from which it arises. It has been assumed that such a region would elicit a greater response to pitch stimuli with stronger pitch salience (the strength of the pitch percept) than it would to stimuli with weaker pitch salience (Griffiths et al.,  ; Krumbholz et al.,  ; Penagos et al.,  ; Hall and Plack,  ; Griffiths,  ). \n\nIterated ripple noise (IRN) is a type of pitch-evoking stimulus that is created by generating a sample of noise, imposing a delay, and adding (or subtracting) the delayed version to (or from) the original (Yost,  ). The delay-and-add process introduces temporal regularity, which evokes a pitch percept that is related to the reciprocal of the delay. The more times this delay-and-add process is repeated, the more salient the pitch becomes (Yost,  ). The fact that pitch salience can be increased easily by repeating the iterative process has made IRN a popular choice of stimulus for use in neuroimaging studies searching for a pitch center. These studies worked on the subtractive assumption that deducting the activation produced by spectrally matched Gaussian noise from that produced by IRN leaves a representation of the pitch response. The IRN response that has been attributed to pitch is highly consistent across individual listeners and is also reproducible between studies (Patterson et al.,  ; Krumbholz et al.,  ; Seither-Preisler et al.,  ,  ; Hall et al.,  ,  ; Hertrich et al.,  ; Barrett and Hall,  ; Sch\u00f6nwiesner and Zatorre,  ; Hall and Plack,  ). Most of these studies have revealed an IRN-related response in an auditory region located antero-lateral to primary auditory cortex, in the lateral portion of Heschl's gyrus (HG), but not restricted to this region. When pitch stimuli other than IRN are used, however, the inter-listener consistency decreases and the group-averaged pitch response appears posterior to lateral HG, in planum temporale (Hall and Plack,  ,  ; Garc\u00eda et al.,  ; Barker et al.,  ,  ). Hall and Plack ( ) suggested that the reason for this difference is that IRN contains an additional acoustic feature, not present in other pitch-evoking stimuli, that elicits a greater differential response in lateral HG than other pitch stimuli. \n\nIRN is made from a sample of Gaussian noise, which has rapidly varying envelope fluctuations. However, the iterative delay-and-add process introduces broad spectro-temporal features into the noise (Hall and Plack,  ) (Figure  ). Most previous pitch studies using IRN have not been designed to separate the pitch response from the response to the slowly varying spectro-temporal fluctuations. In order to determine whether it is the pitch, the slowly varying modulations or an interaction between the two that drives the IRN-related response, Barker et al. ( ) created a new type of stimulus. This novel stimulus consists of IRN that has been processed in a way that removes the temporal fine structure responsible for the pitch percept, whilst leaving the slowly varying spectro-temporal features intact. IRN that is processed in this way is called \u201cno-pitch IRN\u201d (IRNo). Results from psychophysical testing indicate that the perceptual discriminability of IRNo modulations improves with increasing number of iterations, in the same way that pitch discrimination thresholds reduce with increasing iterations for IRN (Barker et al.,  ). This is because the depth of the modulations in IRNo increases with increasing iterations. \n  \n Simulated cochlear representations of IRN (top row) and IRNo (bottom row) in the form of spectrograms  . The number of delay and add iterations increases from left to right. The analysis smoothes the representation in both time and frequency domains to remove any fine structure related to pitch. All stimuli were created from the same original sample of Gaussian noise, and the IRNo stimuli on the bottom row are processed versions of the stimuli on the top row (IRN). The color bar shows model output in dB SPL. See Barker et al. ( ) for details of the model. \n  \nSince the strengths of the pitch and modulation percepts appear to covary, the results of studies that have examined the neural response to pitch salience, using IRN as the sole pitch-evoking stimulus are potentially confounded by the response to the slowly varying spectro-temporal modulations (Griffiths et al.,  ; Patterson et al.,  ; Krumbholz et al.,  ; Seither-Preisler et al.,  ,  ; Barrett and Hall,  ; Hall et al.,  ; Sch\u00f6nwiesner and Zatorre,  ). In a previous fMRI study, Barker et al. ( ) demonstrated that the response to these modulations contributes to the cortical auditory response that authors of previous IRN studies have interpreted as pitch specificity. In that study, IRN produced significant activation when contrasted with Gaussian noise, but did not produce any significant activation when contrasted with IRNo. Barker et al. also found that the high inter-listener consistency (75% in the left hemisphere and 88% in the right) decreased by 37% (to 38%) in the left hemisphere and by 44% (to 44%) in the right when IRNo was used as a control compared to when the control was a Gaussian noise. \n\nIn the first fMRI study to dissociate the effects of energy onset and pitch onset, Garc\u00eda et al. ( ) revealed a non-linear blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response for the addition of one stimulus feature (pitch) to another (energy). The authors suggested that the same neural population was responding to both stimulus features and the sum of the responses reached a maximum saturating limit. If slow-rate modulations and pitch are processed by the same neural population, it is possible that these two features saturate the neural response so that the addition of one feature has little effect on the response to the other. While Barker et al. ( ) found that BOLD responses to IRN and IRNo are broadly similar, suggesting that slow-rate modulations influence the response to IRN, they did not include a stimulus with pitch but without slow modulations, so they were unable to separately manipulate slow modulations and pitch. \n\nThe primary motivation for the current study was to quantify the relation between cortical responses to pitch (in general) and to slow-rate spectro-temporal modulations. The research question was examined within a spherical region-of-interest centered anatomically on an   a priori   estimate of the location of the pitch center based on co-ordinates reported in the published literature. \n\nThe second research question addressed by the current study concerned the effect of pitch and modulation salience on the BOLD response in the pitch-responsive region. Pitch salience was manipulated in two ways: using IRN with different numbers of iterations and using an unresolved harmonic complex with and without a noise masker. Additionally, IRNo stimuli (with a corresponding number of iterations) were used to determine whether activation increases with increasing modulation depth. \n\nIn summary, the main research questions addressed here are:\n   \nAre the responses to slowly varying spectro-temporal modulations and to pitch co-located? \n  \nAre the generators of the pitch and modulation responses sensitive to differing levels of salience for these features? \n  \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Listeners \n  \nFourteen listeners (seven males, seven females; age range 22\u201348 years) with normal hearing (\u226420 dB hearing level between 250 Hz and 8 kHz) took part in fMRI testing. All listeners were right-handed (laterality index = 50, Oldfield,  ). Seven listeners were musically trained between grade 2 and grade 7 (# 02, 07, 12, 19, 22, 23, and 25) while three others reported informal musical experience (self-taught/ungraded, # 05, 09, and 13). None had a history of any neurological or hearing impairment. Listeners gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the Medical School Research Ethics Committee, University of Nottingham. The scanning session for one of the listeners (# 25) had to be terminated due to a significant region of unilateral local MR signal decay around auditory cortex, possibly due to a shimming artifact which could not be rectified. Another subject (# 19) had to be excluded from the analysis because the fMRI time series failed the subjective quality control; the amount of head motion exceeded 3 mm and 3\u00b0 in at least one plane each, hence there was an absence of reliable sound-related activity. \n\n\n### Conditions \n  \nThe experimental design comprised 10 stimulus conditions which part crossed the factors pitch, spectro-temporal modulation, and salience. Two types of pitch-evoking stimuli were employed; IRN and unresolved harmonic complex tones (unres). IRN stimuli comprised three levels of pitch salience (4, 16, and 64 iterations\u2014denoted IRN , IRN , and IRN , respectively), while the unres stimuli had two levels of pitch salience (masked and unmasked unres). Another stimulus contained slowly-varying spectro-temporal fluctuations, but did not evoke a pitch percept (IRNo). This stimulus had three levels of fluctuation salience (4, 16, and 64 iterations\u2014denoted IRNo , IRNo , and IRNo , respectively). The design also included two control conditions. The first was a Gaussian noise (noise) and the second was a Gaussian noise that had been processed in the same way as the IRNo stimuli (processed noise). \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nAll of the stimuli were matched in their average spectrum (both in spectral range and spectral density) but differed in whether they had a temporal pitch structure or slow spectro-temporal modulations. All IRN and unres stimuli evoked a pitch corresponding to a 100-Hz tone. For the unres conditions, the fundamental frequency (f0) was 100 Hz. Harmonics were added in cosine phase, and the stimuli were bandpass-filtered between 1 and 2 kHz to remove low-numbered harmonics that are resolved (i.e., separated out) by the peripheral auditory system. As in previous studies (e.g., Hall and Plack,  ) the removal of resolved harmonics was necessary to eliminate tonotopic differences between the pitch stimuli and the control noise, that could have caused differences in activation driven by processes unrelated to pitch. For the unmasked unres condition, the level of each harmonic was 72 dB SPL, chosen so that the gross spectral density (and overall level) of all the stimuli was the same. To make the low-pitch-salience (masked) unres, a bandpass-filtered (1\u20132 kHz) Gaussian noise masker was added to the unres complex so that the level of the complex tone equaled the level of the masking noise (0 dB signal-to-noise ratio). The level of each harmonic for the masked unres condition was 69 dB SPL, and the spectrum level of the added noise masker was 49 dB SPL, again chosen so that the gross spectral density (and overall level) of all the stimuli was the same. The addition of a noise masker in the spectral region of the unmasked unres reduces the pitch salience. A pilot psychophysical study using nine listeners revealed that f0 discrimination thresholds for masked unres were on average 11% higher than for unmasked unres. \n\nIRN stimuli were generated by a delay-and-add process performed on a Gaussian noise. A delay of 10 ms was imposed before adding the delayed noise back to the original sample. The delay-and-add process was repeated 4, 16 or 64 times to generate the three IRN conditions, and each stimulus was adjusted to a spectrum level of 52 dB SPL. The IRN was bandpass filtered (1\u20132 kHz) to remove the resolved harmonics. \n\nTo create IRNo, a conventional IRN stimulus was generated as above. The IRN was sampled using a rectangular window with a 10-ms duration. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) was used to generate the magnitude and phase spectra of the sample, and the phase of the components was randomized. An inverse FFT was then used to regenerate the time representation. The sampling window was advanced by half of the IRN delay (5 ms) and the process repeated. The processed samples were overlapped and added (preserving the start-times of the samples), and adjusted to a spectrum level of 52 dB SPL. The phase randomization process removes any correlation in the fine structure between samples, obliterating the harmonic structure and the pitch cue. However, the slowly varying broad spectral features are preserved. These fluctuations are visible in the spectrogram representation of IRN when it is smoothed in both time and frequency domains to remove any fine structure (Figure  ). The process was repeated using the IRN , IRN , and IRN  conditions to generate the three IRNo conditions. All experimental stimuli included a noise masker, low-pass filtered at 1 kHz and with a spectrum level of 52 dB SPL, to mask cochlear distortion products. \n\nThe noise control had a 52 dB SPL spectrum level and was low-pass filtered at 2 kHz. The processed noise control was generated in the same way as the IRNo, but was otherwise identical to the noise control. The processed noise was perceptually identical to the Gaussian noise but was included to control for any unforeseen effects of processing. All stimuli were matched in bandwidth (0\u20132 kHz) and spectral density, and hence overall energy (85 dB SPL). Every experimental and control stimulus was gated to produce a time waveform with a 580-ms steady state and 10-ms linear-intensity ramps. \n\nThe energy onset response is an effect that dominates responses in the auditory cortex to repeated bursts of sounds, so that sensitivity to pitch is reduced (Krumbholz et al.,  ; Seither-Preisler et al.,  ; Garc\u00eda et al.,  ). To improve sensitivity to the features of interest, we employed a \u201ccontinuous stimulation\u201d paradigm in which experimental sounds were interspersed by short bursts of noise. In the MR scanner, stimulus conditions each comprised a 15.19-s alternating sequence of 600-ms experimental sounds each separated by 250 ms Gaussian noise (durations included onset and offset ramps) with the same overall spectrum (0\u20132 kHz) and sound level as the experimental sounds. The 10-ms ramps of the two sounds in each sequence were overlapped at the 3 dB downpoint (at 5 ms); there were 18 presentations of each sound, 19 presentations of each noise and the remaining 5-ms ramps at the beginning and end of the sequence (Figure  ). Sound files of all stimuli have been included as supplementary material. \n  \n Schematic representation of the continuous stimulation paradigm used for presentation of stimuli in the MR scanner  . The 10-ms ramps of the two sounds in each sequence were overlapped at the 3 dB SPL point (at 5 ms) to produce a stable envelope. \n  \n\n### fMRI protocol \n  \nScanning was performed on a Philips 3 Tesla Intera Achieva using an 8-channel SENSE receiver head coil. A   T1  -weighted high-resolution (1 mm ) anatomical image (  matrix   size = 256 \u00d7 256, 160 sagittal slices,   TR   = 8.2 s,   TE   = 3.6 ms) was collected for each subject. The anatomical scan was used to position the functional scan centrally on HG, and care was taken to include the entire superior temporal gyrus and to exclude the eyes. Functional scanning used a   T  2 -weighted echo-planar sequence with a voxel size of 3 mm  (  matrix   size = 64 \u00d7 64, 32 oblique-axial slices,   TE   = 36 ms). Sparse imaging with a   TR   of 8188 ms and a clustered acquisition time of 1990 ms was used (Edmister et al.,  ; Hall et al.,  ). The beginning of every odd-numbered scan triggered the onset of a stimulus condition, with the even-numbered scans occurring midway through the stimulus and a short pause before the start of the next stimulus. A SENSE factor of 2 was applied to reduce image distortions and a SofTone factor of 2 was used to reduce the background scanner noise level by 9 dB. Functional data was acquired over four runs of 98 scans each. Each sound condition had a total of 32 scans, with 34 scans for the silent baseline. Listeners were requested to listen attentively to the sounds, but were not required to perform any task. A custom-built MR compatible system delivered distortion-free sound using high-quality electrostatic headphones (Sennheiser HE60 with high-voltage amplifier HEV70) with passive noise attenuation. An active noise control (ANC) device (Hall et al.,  ) was used to reduce the overall acoustical scanner noise by a further 14 dB. Eight scans were appended to the beginning of the run in order to initialize the noise cancelling device. These scans were excluded from the analysis. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nImages were analyzed separately for each listener using statistical parametric mapping (SPM5,  ). Preprocessing steps included realignment to correct for subject motion, normalization of individual scans to a standard image template, and smoothing with a Gaussian filter of 8 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). The realignment process generated estimates of the scan-to-scan movement for three translations (x, y, and z planes) and three rotations (roll, pitch, and yaw). These were included as variables in the individual design specification in addition to the 10 sound conditions and the four scanning runs. The silent baseline was implicitly modeled in the design. The first-level general linear model assessed the variables of interest with respect to the scan-to-scan variability. A high-pass filter cutoff of 420 s was used to remove low frequency confounds. The resulting model estimated the fit of the design matrix (X) to the data (Y) in each voxel in order to provide \u03b2-values (the contribution of a single regressor to the overall fMRI signal). Separate statistical contrasts for each sound condition were specified relative to the silent baseline. To investigate the differential responses across conditions, a One-Way ANOVA was specified at the second level with all 10 sound contrasts, using the preceding contrast images for each individual as input. We defined the model in this way because it provides maximum flexibility for assessing the different effects of interest. Different combinations of contrast weights were then specified from the variables in the ANOVA to determine differences between factors. Contrast weights for each of the stimulus conditions of interest (pitch and slow modulation) were defined to provide a factorial model where two stimulus conditions contributed to each cell in the matrix. The design is represented schematically in Figure  . It is important to note that the pitch salience of the IRN is not matched to the salience of the unres and so the design is not fully factorial. \n  \n Schematic representation of the subset of stimuli that contribute to the 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design  . Each cell in the matrix contains two levels of salience except for the \u201cno pitch, no modulation\u201d cell. \n  \nAlthough 14 listeners were scanned, only 12 were included in the analyses (reasons for excluding subjects 19 and 25 were mentioned in the Listeners section above). To improve external validity, our interpretation of the pitch- and modulation-related activity was informed by a spherical region of interest (ROI) with a radius = 10 mm. This ROI was centered on the average peak co-ordinates that had been derived from four previous pitch studies (Table  ) with coordinates   x  -58   y  -24   z  -7 in the left hemisphere and   x  -63   y  -17   z  -5 in the right. All studies included in the average used normal-hearing participants with no history of neurological disease. Studies using IRN were excluded because of the potential confound with the response to slow modulation and only those studies reporting Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates for non-IRN pitch responses could be included. Pitch-related activation within this spherical ROI was interpreted to represent a highly consistent pitch response across studies. This spherical ROI encompassed parts of central and lateral HG and PT. Localization was made with reference to a software toolbox in SPM5 that estimates the cytoarchitectonic subdivisions of HG and assigns probability values estimating the likelihood that a voxel occurs within a particular auditory field (Morosan et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). According to this particular anatomical scheme, medial HG is called Te 1.1, central HG is called Te 1.0, and lateral HG is called Te 1.2. \n  \n Location (MNI coordinates) of pitch-related responses identified by previous fMRI studies using various pitch-evoking stimuli  . \n  \nVoxels significant at p < 0.05 FDR corrected within the spherical ROI. \n  \nExamining the main effect of slow modulation and the interaction between slow modulation and pitch were also restricted to the same spherical region in order to ascertain whether any such effects might be present within the pitch-responsive region. All significant results have been controlled for type I errors by employing a volume correction based on the number of independent voxel elements within the spherical ROI. This correction used a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of   p   < 0.05 (Genovese et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Sensitivity to pitch and to slow modulation \n  \nTo determine whether the responses to pitch and to slow modulation are co-located to the same voxels within the pitch-related ROI, the response to pitch was measured by comparing the four most salient pitch conditions (masked unres, unmasked unres, IRN , IRN ) to the four matched no-pitch conditions (noise, processed noise, IRNo  and IRNo ) (Figure  ). Within the spherical ROI, this contrast highlighted bilateral peaks of pitch-related activity with maxima in posterior auditory cortex (PT) (  x  -64   y  -28   z  -6 in the left hemisphere and   x  -64   y  -22   z  -10 in the right, Table  ). The cluster in the left hemisphere contained two further maxima. Probability estimates placed both peaks in central HG, although one was potentially within lateral HG. The right hemisphere cluster contained one further maximum. This peak was most likely in PT, although again lateral HG could not be ruled out. \n  \n Statistical   T   map from the 2 \u00d7 2 factorial ANOVA showing locations of the group-averaged responses for the main effects of slow modulation (blue) and pitch (red), and a conjunction for the two features (pink)  . The yellow border denotes Te 1.2 (lateral portion of HG) and the black border outlines PT (informed by Westbury et al.,  ). Activation is overlaid onto an average anatomical image made from the 12 individual listeners. The left hemisphere is on the left-hand side of each anatomical image. These images used an uncorrected threshold   p   < 0.05. This figure demonstrates the patterns of activation across the entire cortex, although the analyses were restricted to a 10-mm sphere centered on the white spots in the middle panel. \n    \n Location (MNI coordinates) of the effects of pitch and modulation, and of the conjunction between pitch and modulation  . \n  \nVoxels significant at p < 0.05 FDR corrected within the spherical ROI. n, indicates the number of voxels within each cluster. \n  \nThe main effect of slow modulation was determined by contrasting IRNo , IRNo , IRN , and IRN  with noise, processed noise, masked and unmasked unres (Figure  ). This contrast did not reveal any clusters of activity that survived correction for multiple comparisons (FDR   p   > 0.05). \n\nAlthough the random effects analysis did not suggest a significant effect of slow modulation, this voxel-by-voxel analysis approach is rather conservative. For example, statistical significance is dependent upon the response being present in the same voxel location across listeners. To allow for some degree of spatial variability, we conducted a region-based analysis averaging each condition-specific response (i.e., mean \u03b2-values) across all voxels within the spherical ROI, separately for each listener. Data extraction for the region-based analysis used the approach described by Hall and Plack ( ). To determine the effects of pitch and modulation and the nature of any interaction between these two factors within the spherical ROI, values were averaged for the two conditions in each cell of the 2 \u00d7 2 ANOVA depicted in Figure  . The region-based analysis revealed significant effects of both pitch [  F   = 24.30,   p   < 0.05] and slow modulation [  F   = 24.19,   p   < 0.05], with a significant interaction between pitch and slow modulation [  F   = 24.55,   p   < 0.05]. The nature of the interaction was such that both of the stimuli that contained slowly varying modulation (IRN and IRNo) and the unresolved harmonic complex elicited a similar response, whereas the stimulus that contained neither pitch nor slow modulation (noise) elicited a lesser response (Figure  ). The relation between the responses to pitch and slow modulation in the pitch-responsive region is   saturating  : the effects of the two features are not linearly additive. However, it is possible that this interaction was influenced by the weaker pitch salience of IRN compared to the unresolved complex tones (see Section Salience-Related Activity). Although there is no evidence that the responses to pitch and to slow modulation are co-located at the voxel level, it is apparent from the spherical ROI analysis that there is an overall effect of both pitch and slow modulation within that region. \n  \n Plot of the results of the 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design within the pitch-responsive ROI (A) and within medial HG (B)  . The ordinate measures percentage increase in BOLD activation from baseline. Error bars show standard errors. \n  \nThe same analysis performed in medial HG (Te 1.1) also revealed a significant effect of pitch [  F   = 2.76,   p   < 0.05], of slow modulation [  F   = 2.29,   p   < 0.05] and a significant interaction between pitch and modulation [  F   = 34.23,   p   < 0.05]. However, the effects of pitch, and the interaction between pitch and modulation, were smaller in Te 1.1 than in the pitch-related ROI (Figure  ). Combining the results, there was a significant two-way interaction between pitch and region (pitch-related ROI and Te 1.1) [  F   = 29.92,   p   < 0.05], and a significant three-way interaction between pitch, modulation, and region [  F   = 13.63,   p   < 0.05]. Hence, there is evidence for some regional specificity in the pitch response, and that the response in the pitch-related ROI is not just a generic response to acoustic change. \n\nIn order to determine whether IRN-related activity is driven by slowly varying spectro-temporal modulation or by pitch, a 2 \u00d7 3 repeated-measures ANOVA was performed within the original spherical ROI for the IRN and IRNo conditions with stimulus (IRN and IRNo) and salience (4, 16, and 64 iterations) as factors. This ANOVA did not reveal a significant effect of stimulus [  F   = 0.981,   p   > 0.05], but there was a significant effect of salience (number of iterations) [  F   = 9.070,   p   < 0.05 (Greenhouse-Geisser corrected)] with no significant interaction between stimulus and salience [  F   = 2.749,   p   > 0.05]. This pattern of results is consistent with our previous interpretation that the spectro-temporal modulations, not the pitch, drive the IRN-related response (Barker et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Salience-related activity \n  \nThe final analyses addressed the second research question: Are the generators of the pitch and modulation responses sensitive to differing levels of salience for these features? A pilot exploration using eight listeners demonstrated that pitch discrimination thresholds for high-salience IRN stimuli were considerably higher than for the low-salience unres stimuli (mean geometric threshold for IRN  and masked unres were 96.9 and 26.4 Hz, respectively [  T   = 4.41,   p   < 0.05]). This finding implies that IRN stimuli elicited a weaker pitch percept than unres stimuli and that the factorial design is not balanced for pitch salience, so these pitch comparisons were analyzed separately. Since the research question relates to an effect of salience   within a pitch-responsive region  , the spherical ROI described previously was applied. For unres stimuli, the subtraction (unmasked unres\u2014masked unres) examined the effect of pitch salience. Within the spherical ROI, this contrast highlighted bilateral clusters in auditory cortex, with peaks located in PT (  x  -58   y  -30   z  -8 in the left hemisphere and   x  -60   y  -22   z  -6 in the right). The left cluster contained four maxima, of which one was potentially located within lateral HG (  x  -56   y  -18   z  -10). The cluster in the right hemisphere contained three maxima including one that incorporated part of lateral HG (  x  -62   y  -6   z  -4). To investigate the effect of pitch salience for the IRN stimuli, the subtraction (IRN \u2014IRN ) was performed and the results were displayed using an \u201cexclusive mask\u201d for the subtraction (IRNo \u2014IRNo ) which means that any voxels showing a differential response to the depth of the spectro-temporal modulations were excluded. There were no maxima for salience-related activity for IRN that remained significant when corrected for multiple comparisons (FDR,   p   > 0.05). \n\nIn order to determine whether the pitch region as a whole was sensitive to pitch salience, the region-based analysis described in 3.1 was performed separately for IRN and for unres. For the IRN stimuli, IRN  and IRN  were contrasted, with values for IRNo  and IRNo , respectively, subtracted to control for the effects of slow-rate modulation. This analysis revealed a significant effect of salience [  F   = 7.84,   p   < 0.05] within the spherical ROI (Figure  ). For unres stimuli, masked and unmasked unres were contrasted. Unsurprisingly (based on the results reported above), this analysis also revealed a significant effect of salience [  F   = 63.02,   p   < 0.05] (Figure  ). It is apparent from Figure   that the low-salience unres produced greater activation than the high-salience IRN [  F   = 33.92,   p   < 0.05], which is consistent with results from the psychophysical testing and could explain why there were no significant salience-related voxels for IRN. \n  \n Plot of the salience analysis results for IRN and for unres within the spherical pitch ROI  . \u201cActivation\u201d refers to the average beta weights: a numerical measure of the effect size. The low salience conditions are represented by the light gray bars and the high salience conditions are represented by the dark gray bars. For the low-salience IRN condition, IRNo  has been subtracted from IRN  and for the high-salience condition, IRNo  has been subtracted from IRN  to remove the effects of slow modulation. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. \n  \nTo investigate the effect of modulation salience, the subtraction (IRNo  - IRNo ) was performed. This contrast did not reveal any supra-threshold clusters (FDR,   p   > 0.05). However, results from the ROI analysis suggest a significantly greater average response to IRNo  than to IRNo  within the spherical ROI [  F   = 5.08,   p   < 0.05]. Hence, when the average BOLD response is taken across all voxels within the pitch-responsive region defined in this study, the region demonstrates sensitivity to both pitch salience and salience of slow-rate modulations. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Responses to pitch and slow modulation \n  \nA previous study (Barker et al.,  ) revealed that the slowly varying spectro-temporal modulations created by the delay-and-add iterative process influence the IRN response, but the results could not determine the precise nature of this influence. It is possible that, due to non-linearities in the neural response (Sidtis et al.,  ; Friston et al.,  ; Devor et al.,  ) there is a saturating interaction between the responses to pitch and to slow modulation whereby the BOLD response is dominated by one feature (e.g., spectro-temporal modulation) so that the response to any additional feature (e.g., pitch) is limited by the saturation of the BOLD signal. In a meta analysis focusing on the role of PT (Griffiths and Warren,  ), the effects of both pitch (tone vs. noise contrast) and modulation (frequency-modulated vs. unmodulated tone contrast) fell within the spherical ROI used in the current study. It is therefore plausible that either the same populations of neurons are responsible for processing both features, or that there are dispersed feature-specific neurons for pitch and for slow modulation that occupy the same region of auditory cortex. Our ROI analysis constrained our hypothesis to a circumscribed focal brain region, and so we cannot rule out this latter alternative explanation. \n\nThe present results revealed a saturating interaction between the responses to pitch and to slow-modulation. This could reflect a saturation in the neural response due to co-location of the representation of the two features. However, a psychophysical pilot experiment revealed that IRN stimuli elicited a much weaker pitch percept than unres stimuli, even when the unres stimuli were masked to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio. With that in mind, it is possible that the pitch percept elicited by IRN was not strong enough to increase the BOLD signal significantly above that of the IRNo stimuli. In other words, we cannot rule out the possibility that the saturating interaction was due to the differing salience of the pitch-evoking stimuli, rather than a saturation in the neural response. \n\n\n### The IRN response may be driven in part by slow modulations \n  \nDue to the lack of a significant difference between the responses to IRN and IRNo discussed above, it is not clear whether the response to IRN is driven mainly by slowly varying modulations or by pitch. This is consistent with the finding of Barker et al. ( ), who reported broadly similar response patterns for IRN and for IRNo within central and lateral HG and within PT. However, both studies indicated a small additional effect of the pitch in IRN over and above the modulation response elicited by IRNo. In the current study, there were significant clusters of activation for the high vs. low salience IRN contrast at an uncorrected level but not for the equivalent IRNo contrast. In the Barker et al. ( ) study, there was a significant linear trend for number of iterations for IRN, but not for IRNo. Furthermore, the contrast (IRN - IRNo) in that study revealed a bilateral pitch-related response for IRN that was co-located for up to seven of their 16 listeners. Therefore, although it appears that slow modulation accounts for the majority of the IRN response magnitude, there is some evidence that pitch does contribute in a small way. \n\n\n### The pitch-responsive region is sensitive to pitch salience and to modulation salience \n  \nSome previous research has suggested a sensitivity to pitch salience in auditory cortex (Griffiths et al.,  ; Penagos et al.,  ; Bendor and Wang,  ; Gutschalk et al.,  ), although this finding is not universal. For example, using pulse trains with different amounts of jitter, and unresolved harmonic complexes with different relative phases, Barker et al. ( ) actually found a   decrease   in activation with increasing pitch salience. The pitch-evoking stimuli used here contained only unresolved harmonics and as such, they elicit a less salient pitch percept than stimuli containing resolved harmonics (Houtsma and Smurzynski,  ). However, the unresolved stimuli were sufficiently salient to investigate the relative salience between the different conditions. Results from the current experiment provide evidence for a general sensitivity to pitch salience within the pitch-responsive region, with specific foci that exhibit a strong salience-related response for salient pitch stimuli. As previously mentioned, the pitch of the high-salience IRN condition was not as strong as the pitch of the low-salience unres condition. Hence, it is possible that the high-salience IRN condition was not sufficiently salient to produce an increase in the magnitude of the BOLD response that was large enough to survive correction in the salience-responsive foci for IRN. Indeed, Figure   provides support for this conjecture. However, results from the ROI analysis suggest a general sensitivity to differences in salience even for stimuli that evoke a weak pitch percept. \n\nTo summarize, the results of the salience analyses suggest that the cortical representation of pitch is sensitive to differing levels of pitch salience. The analysis also provides evidence that the cortical response is sensitive to differing depths of slow modulation, which suggests that slow modulation may affect the salience response for IRN. \n\n\n### Implications for the location of the \u201cpitch center\u201d \n  \nTo minimize the effects of onset energy, we chose to use a paradigm in which noise was interleaved between stimuli. As a result of this design choice, all of the conditions except the Gaussian noise condition had perceptible acoustic changes from stimulus to stimulus, and thus the observed response pattern could possibly be driven, at least in part, by a generic response to presence of acoustic changes, rather than to the presence of modulation or pitch   per se  . However, the ROI studied here has been identified by several studies as being selective for pitch using a pulsed paradigm (without interleaved noise) (Hall and Plack,  ; Barker et al.,  ; Puschmann et al.,  ; Garc\u00eda et al.,  ). There is external evidence, therefore, that the ROI is not a region that responds non-specifically to any stimulus change. In addition, in the present study pitch-related activation was greater in the spherical ROI than in Te 1.1, suggesting a specificity for pitch processing in the spherical ROI. \n\nEvidence from MEG and fMRI studies also suggests that the present results probably reflect a specific response to the effects of interest (pitch and slow modulation) rather than to non-specific response to   any   change in stimulus feature. For example, using IRN as their pitch stimulus, Krumbholz et al. ( ) reported a significant magnetic deflection for the change from noise to pitch with no corresponding deflection for the change from pitch to noise. Chait et al. ( ) found distinct temporal and spatial differences between the change from noise to pitch (Huggins pitch and pure tone in noise) and the change from decorrelated to correlated noise. Dipole source modeling locates the responses from both MEG studies in lateral HG, although the spatial resolution is not accurate enough to rule out the possibility that their responses could have been located in PT or across the two regions. Finally, in an fMRI study using Huggins pitch and an unresolved harmonic complex as their stimuli, Garc\u00eda et al. ( ) reported a significant difference between their pitch-in-noise vs. constant noise contrast and their noise-in-silence vs. constant noise contrast in the region of PT. However, even if the pitch-sensitive region examined in the present experiment does not respond to all stimulus features, it clearly responds strongly to slow modulations, and the response to these features interacts with the response to pitch. This raises doubts regarding whether the \u201cpitch center\u201d is exclusive for pitch processing. \n\nWithin the spherical ROI, it is conjectured that the precise location of pitch-sensitive responses had some spatial variability across individual listeners. Our evidence here is based on the fact that there was no significant voxel-by-voxel response, possibly due to the lack of a voxel-level overlap. \n\n\n\n## Summary \n  \nThe pre-defined pitch-responsive region was found to contain representations for both pitch and slow modulation. There was also a response to pitch salience and to modulation salience in this region. The results support the suggestion made by Barker et al. ( ) that the slowly varying spectro-temporal modulations in IRN affect the response. This finding implies that future studies using IRN as a pitch-evoking stimulus should employ a baseline that controls for these modulations (such as IRNo) and that interpretations from results of previous studies using IRN as their sole pitch-evoking stimulus should be carefully reconsidered. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tLeft\tLeft\tLeft\tRight\tRight\tRight\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tx\ty\tz\tx\ty\tz\nHall and Plack, ???\tNo left hemisphere clusters\tNo left hemisphere clusters\tNo left hemisphere clusters\t64\t\u221218\t4\nPuschmann et al., ???\t\u221250\t\u221220\t5\t58\t\u221212\t7\nGarc\u00eda et al., ???

Studies using a variety of paradigms involving self-performed actions argue in favor of perspective taking confusion in hallucination-prone subjects. However, our understanding of such processes during adolescence is still at an early stage. The present study thus aims (1) to delineate the neural correlates sustaining mental simulation of actions involving self-performed actions (first-person perspective; 1PP) and other-performed actions (third-person perspective; 3PP) during adolescence (2) to identify atypical activation patterns during 1PP/3PP mental simulation of actions in hallucination-prone adolescents (3) to examine whether differential risk for schizophrenia (clinical vs. genetic) is also associated with differential impairments in the 1PP/3PP mental simulation of actions during adolescence. Twenty-two typically developing controls (Control group; 6 females), 12 hallucination-prone adolescents [auditory hallucination (AH) group; 7 females] and 13 adolescents with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS group; 4 females) were included in the study. During the fMRI task, subjects were presented with a cue (self-other priming cues) indicating to perform the task using either a first person perspective (\u201cyou\u201d-1PP) or a third person perspective (\u201cbest friend\u201d-3PP) and then they were asked to mentally simulate actions based on the type of cue. Hallucination-proneness was assessed using a self-report questionnaire [Cardiff Anomalous Perception Scale (CAPS)]. Our results indicated that atypical patterns of cerebral activation, particularly in the key areas of self-other distinction, were found in both groups at risk for auditory hallucinations (AHs and 22q11.2DS). More precisely, adolescents in the AH group presented decreased activations in the right middle occipital gyrus BA19, left cingulate gyrus BA31, and right precuneus BA31 for the 3PP > 1PP contrast. Adolescents in the 22q11.2DS group presented decreased activations in the right superior occipital gyrus BA19, left caudate tail and left precuneus BA7 for the 3PP > 1PP contrast. In comparison to the Control group, only the 22q11.2DS adolescents showed a decreased activation for other-related cues (prime other > prime self contrast) in areas of visual imagery, episodic memory and social cognition. This study characterizes the neural correlates of mental imagery for actions during adolescence, and suggests that a differential risk for hallucination-proneness (clinical vs. genetic) is associated to similar patterns of atypical activations in key areas sustaining self-other discrimination processes. These observations may provide relevant information for future research and prevention strategies with regards to hallucination-proneness during adolescence. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAuditory hallucinations (AHs) have been conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental phenomenon (Bentall et al.,  ) with a prevalence varying from 6 to 33% in adolescence (see review Lar\u00f8i et al.,  ). A number of cognitive processes are thought to sustain the expression of AH, such as attention shift/enhancement, executive and inhibitory deficits, and source monitoring (SM) (Hugdahl,  ; Jones,  ; Badcock and Hugdahl,  ; Waters et al.,  ). The developmental course of these cognitive processes during childhood and adolescence suggests that investigating hallucination-proneness during these key developmental windows may help better understand the onset of early AH. \n\nSM is a processes associated with the development of AH. Impairments in SM are thought to lead to the misattribution of self-generated mental contents such as thoughts, memories or action to external sources in hallucination-prone adults (Bentall and Slade,  ; Rankin and O'Carroll,  ; Lar\u00f8i et al.,  ,  ), in adults with schizophrenia (Bentall et al.,  ; Rankin and O'Carroll,  ; Blakemore et al.,  ; Brebion et al.,  ; Brunelin et al.,  ) and in adolescents at high genetic risk for psychosis (22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome; Debbane et al.,  ). \n\nMost of these studies used a verbal SM paradigm. However Lar\u00f8i and collaborators used a SM task for actions and found evidence for misattribution of imagined actions in hallucinations-prone adults (Lar\u00f8i et al.,  ). In this study, subjects were asked to (1) imagine themselves or (2) the experimenter performing an action (3) repeat the action statement without imaging the action or (4) simply observe the experimenter carrying out the action. The results revealed that hallucination-prone subjects more often remembered self-performed imagined actions as being imagined actions performed by the experimenter. \n\nA subsequent study employed a similar action-monitoring paradigm with adolescents affected by a 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) (Debbane et al.,  ). 22q11.2DS is a neurogenetic disorder with an ultra-high risk for developing schizophrenia (Murphy et al.,  ; Karayiorgou et al.,  ). Transient psychotic experiences are characteristic of more than half of the adolescents with this syndrome (Baker and Skuse,  ). Furthermore, AHs are the most commonly reported symptoms in the sample of 22q11.2DS children and adolescents investigated by our group (Debbane et al.,  ). The assessment of 22q11.2DS adolescents with a SM task adapted from Lar\u00f8i et al. ( ), showed that adolescents with 22q11.2DS committed more source confusions by recalling imagined-experimenter actions as actions they had mentally repeated (and vice versa), suggesting potential impairments in third person perspective (3PP) taking. \n\nThese two studies (Lar\u00f8i et al.,  ; Debbane et al.,  ) highlight the impairments in   offline   SM for actions in two populations with hallucination-proneness. Their results might come from disturbances in how information is encoded between first-person perspective (1PP) and 3PP. Theoretical explanations suggest that encoding processes during   online   representation of actions may promote subsequent confusion between self and other by two complementary aspects (1) increased salience of internal representations leading to exaggerated self-focused orientation (Ingram,  ; Ensum and Morrison,  ; Kapur,  ; Perona-Garcelan et al.,  ) (2) impairments in the sense of agency, i.e., the ability to experience oneself as the agent of one's own actions (Gallagher,  ), as evoked by several authors (Schneider,  ; Seal et al.,  ; Jones and Fernyhough,  ; Asai and Tanno,  ). Among the multiple neurocognitive models of the sense of agency (David et al.,  ; Sperduti et al.,  ; Gallagher,  ), Jeannerod and colleagues propose to differentiate between actions overtly executed and those that remain covert, i.e., internally represented (Jeannerod,  ; Georgieff and Jeannerod,  ). Self-other attribution of covert actions might be sustained by the activity of brain areas specifically devoted to self-other representations (Georgieff and Jeannerod,  ; Jeannerod and Pacherie,  ; Jeannerod,  ). \n\nIn order to identify the specific regions involved in the discrimination of self-other action simulation, Ruby and Decety ( ) employed positron emission tomography (PET) to compare the neural correlates of action simulation in a 1PP and a 3PP. Their results showed that both 1PP and 3PP involve overlapping areas of neural processing, in accordance with the shared neural representations theory (Georgieff and Jeannerod,  ; Grezes and Decety,  ; Decety and Chaminade,  ; Decety and Sommerville,  ). However, specific regions were identified in the right inferior parietal, precuneus, posterior cingulate and frontopolar cortices for 3PP, and in the left inferior parietal and somatosensory cortices for 1PP. The authors concluded that the right inferior parietal, precuneus and somatosensory cortices are key areas involved in self/others action discrimination. The inferior parietal lobule is thought to be involved in body image, self-recognition and integration of information coming from sensory modalities and proprioceptive signals (Jeannerod and Pacherie,  ; Torrey,  ). Interestingly, increased activation in the inferior parietal lobule has been observed during conflict between a self-produced action and its consequences (Farrer et al.,  ). The anterior region of the precuneus is related to self-centered imagery and the posterior part to successful episodic memory retrieval (Cavanna and Trimble,  ). According to the authors, the somatosensory cortex could play a role in self-representation (Ruby and Decety,  ,  ,  ). \n\nAnother study focused more specifically on the visuo-spatial aspects of perspective taking during action imagery (Jeannerod and Anquetil,  ). The authors compared brain activity with PET while subjects imagined the same action (reaching and grasping a cylinder) from a 1PP and 3PP. This paradigm revealed increased activation in the parieto-occipital junction (BA19) specifically for the 3PP. The authors conclude that the right BA 19 is a key area for self-other differentiation by evaluating the difference in spatial localization between oneself and an other's perspective. \n\nIn summary key areas of self/other distinction for covert actions are thought to essentially engage the parietal cortex region for multi-modal integration and the parietal-temporal-occipital region, which underpins the shift to another location in space during perspective taking (Ruby and Decety,  ,  ,  ; Vogeley and Fink,  ; Jeannerod,  ; David et al.,  ). \n\nIn order to investigate the neural correlates underlying both self- and other-focused orientation and self-other perspective taking during action imagery, we used a functional magnetic resonance imagery paradigm adapted from Lar\u00f8i et al. ( ). During this task subjects were first primed with a self-other priming cues (namely \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cbest friend\u201d) and secondly were asked to mentally simulate actions with either from a first-person (1PP) or a third-person (best friend) perspective (3PP) in accordance with the priming cue. Typically developing adolescents and adolescents clinically prone to hallucinate (AH group) as well as with a 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS group) underwent this task. \n\nThis study has three aims: (1) delineate the neural correlates of action simulation in specific 1PP and 3PP during adolescence (2) identify potential impairments at a neurofunctional level in hallucination-prone adolescents (3) examine whether a differential risk for schizophrenia (clinical vs. genetic) is also associated with differential impairments in the mental simulation of action during adolescence. \n\nWe hypothesized that: (1) typically developing adolescents would activate specific regions devoted to 1PP and 3PP already observed in adult subjects (Ruby and Decety,  ; Jeannerod and Anquetil,  ) (2) the AH group and the 22q11.2DS group would present atypical patterns of brain activation in regions sustaining self-other action simulation, along with confusion in self-other remembered actions. (3) Subjects with 22q11.2DS would present atypical patterns of activation in the parietal cortices due to functional and structural impairments (Simon et al.,  ; Dufour et al.,  ; Bearden et al.,  ; Schaer et al.,  ; Debbane et al.,  ) whereas the AH group would exhibit atypical activations in the prefrontal cortex, as suggested by previous SM studies (Vinogradov et al.,  ; Lagioia et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nEighty adolescents aged from 12 to 20 years participated in the study. Exclusion criteria included age, the presence of any neurological problem or a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Thirty-two subjects were excluded for head movement exceeding 4.7 mm in any of the 6 directions during the scan sessions (Control group:   N   = 9, AH group:   N   = 6, 22q11.2DS group:   N   = 17). In the Control group, we excluded subjects with maladaptive functioning above the clinical cut-off of the Internalizing and Externalizing scales (  t  -score >64) in the Youth Self-Report and Adult Behavior Checklist (Achenbach,  ,  ) (  N   = 1). After excluding these 33 subjects, the 47 remaining youths were distributed in the following three groups: typically developing adolescents (Control group:   N   = 22), adolescents with transient AHs (AH group:   N   = 12) and adolescents with a 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS group:   N   = 13). \n\nOut of the 22 subjects in the Control group (mean age: 16.00,   SD   = 2.04, 16 males), 6 were recruited within the siblings of 22q11.2DS participants and 16 from the Geneva state school system. \n\nIn the AH group, 12 subjects with subclinical AHs (mean age: 15.97,   SD   = 2.12, 5 males) were recruited through patient associations, by word of mouth or through the Child and Adolescents Outpatient Public Service (Office M\u00e9dico-P\u00e9dagogique). Subjects were selected on the basis of a positive answer (yes or no) on the Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale (CAPS) items describing AH items [i.e., items 3, 7, 11, 13, 28, or 32; (Bell et al.,  ; Debban\u00e9 et al.,  ); see Table  ]. If they answered positively to an item, they were asked to rate their distress, the intrusiveness and the frequency of the experience by circling a number between 1 (not at all) and 5 (very). \n  \n CAPS selected items for auditory hallucinations (Bell et al.,  ; Debban\u00e9 et al.,  )  . \n  \nIn the 22q11.2DS group, all adolescents (mean age: 16.14,   SD   = 2.55, 9 males) were recruited through parent associations in France, Belgium and Switzerland. The 22q11.2 deletion was confirmed using DNA polymorphism analysis based on short sequence repeats or by fluorescence in situ hybridization performed on metaphase spreads spanning the deleted region. \n\nWritten informed consent was accepted by all parents and/or subjects under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Geneva University School of Medicine. The three groups (Control, AH and 22q11.2DS) did not significantly differ according to age and gender (  p   > 0.05). At the time of testing, no participants were receiving psychotropic medication (data for this was missing for one subjects in the 22q11.2DS group). All participants underwent the Block Design subtest (Kohs,  ) in order to assess intellectual scores. \n\n\n### Design and procedure \n  \nBefore the scan session, the experimenter described the task to the participants (see Figure  ). The paradigm was adapted from Lar\u00f8i et al. ( ) and included 60 actions to be mentally simulated (imagined) either from a 1PP or 3PP. Simple, universal and gender-neutral actions were chosen. All actions implied a movement and an object (for example   take a picture, open a bottle, open a window, play the violin, brush your hair  ). 30 actions were tested with a 1PP and 30 with a 3PP, in the same randomized order for each participant. \n  \n Action simulation task adapted from Lar\u00f8i et al. ( )  . \n  \nAt the start of each session, the task's instructions appeared on the screen as a reminder. Then, a cross appeared on the screen for 665 ms. Immediately after the self-other priming cue appeared for 1 s stating either \u201cYou\u201d written in red or \u201cBest friend\u201d in blue. Then, the photo of an object accompanied by a written instruction specifying the action to be imagined (i.e., play the violin, open a bottle, knock on a door) appeared for 1487 ms. Then the participants were reminded to either \u201cImagine yourself doing the action\u201d or \u201cImagine your best friend doing the action\u201d in accordance with the self-other priming cue. This instruction remained on the screen for a total of 4 s. An instruction in the center of the screen asked participants were asked to evaluate the difficulty of imagining the previous action, by pressing 1 (very easy) to 4 (very hard) on a set of buttons on a console. This last step was used to make sure that the subjects performed the task. When a button was pressed, a blank screen appeared followed by the inter-trial interval (ITI) period, which lasted from 2990 to 5990 ms. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nA 3T Siemens TIM Trio system was used to acquire anatomical and functional images [  TR   (inter-trial between scan acquisition) = 2400 ms, Echo time (  TE  ) = 30 ms, Slice thickness = 3.20 mm, Flip angle = 85\u00b0, FOV 235 mm]. The functional scan session consisted of 380 volumes that comprised 38 slices oriented parallel to the AC-PC lines and collected in a descending sequence. High-resolution three-dimensional anatomical images were also obtained [  TR   (inter-trial between scan acquisition) = 2400 ms,   TE   = 30 ms, Slice thickness = 1.1 mm, Flip angle = 8\u00b0, 192 coronal slices, FOV 220 mm]. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nWe used Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) 8, (Welcome Department of Neuroscience, London, UK) to analyse the data. First of all images had to be spatially transformed during the pre-processing step in order to reduce movement effects or shape differences among a series of scans. We realigned every image with respect to the first one. Then, slice timing correction was performed using the middle slice as a reference. We co-registered structural images of each participant to the mean of the realigned functional images. Gray matter separation was established by segmentation of the anatomical image. Thereafter, the normalization produced images that were warped to fit to a standard Template brain. We normalized the realigned and slice-timed images into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template using 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm isotropic voxels. The images were spatially smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian smoothing Kernel of 6 mm full width half maximum (FWHM) to conform to inter-individual brain size variability. \n\nAfter pre-processing, the brain responses of each subject were estimated at every voxel using a general linear mode. We defined two main conditions namely \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother.\u201d The \u201cself\u201d condition corresponds to the trials starting with the word \u201cyou\u201d in the priming period and when imagining an action performed by oneself (action stimulation period). The \u201cother\u201d condition refers to the trials starting with the word \u201cbest friend\u201d in the priming period and when imagining an action performed by the best friend (action stimulation period). The return to baseline periods were set in the ITIs during which subjects saw a blank screen for 2990 ms to 5990 ms between each trial. In order to compare the specific areas devoted to the two different periods of the task (prime period and action simulation period) voxel value maps of t statistics were obtained for 4 contrasts: (1) prime self > prime other (2) prime other > prime self (3) 1PP > 3PP (4) 3PP > 1PP. These contrasts were performed for the following reasons. First, the prime self > prime other contrast will shield information on the neural correlates related to attention oriented to the self. In relation to our knowledge about overlapping activated brain regions for 1PP and 3PP-taking, some authors have suggested that 3PP requires \u201cadditional\u201d areas in contrast to 1PP and vice-versa (Jeannerod,  ,  ; Jeannerod and Pacherie,  ; Jeannerod and Anquetil,  ). As such, it may be that hallucination-prone subjects fail to properly engage these areas, thereby increasing possible confusions between self and other. The two other contrasts (1PP > 3PP, 3PP > 1PP) follow the same logic, but when considering actual action imagery. T-maps were produced to identify atypical activation of the neural correlates sustaining self-other orientation and perspective taking for actions. \n\nWe first performed a one-sample   t  -test to characterize typical activations in control adolescents, and then proceeded to group comparison analyses. Using a two-sample   t  -test (comparison between groups), we compared Control and AH groups, Control and 22q11.2DS groups, and finally 22q11.2DS and AH groups. S{T} maps were obtained with a threshold of   p   < 0.05 and an extend threshold k of 20 voxels. Cluster level peak functional activity at   p   < 0.05 (Family-Wise corrected) was then localized on a mean structural scan with approximate Brodmann areas estimated from the Talairach and Tournoux ( ) atlas after having converted coordinates from MNI to Talairach templates ( ). Age was entered as a covariate in each analysis without any significant effects on the results obtained. \n\nFor   post-hoc   examination of potential associations between hallucination-proneness scores and activations resulting from group comparisons, we planned to extract local brain activity of regions of interest (ROIs) using SPM8 toolbox Marsbar ( ). The ROIs were delimited around the peak of significant activations in prime self > prime other, prime other > prime self, 1PP > 3PP, 3PP > 1PP contrasts for the group comparisons. A 5 mm radius sphere was defined around the center of mass for each subject to extract Beta Values. We performed Pearson correlations between Beta Values obtained for different ROIs and CAPS components for each subjects (AHs distress, intrusiveness, frequency, total scores, as well as subscale scores) (Bell et al.,  ; Debban\u00e9 et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nDifferences regarding evaluation results between the three groups and the two different conditions were analysed using a repeated-measures ANOVA 3(groups) \u00d7 2(conditions) with   post-hoc   Tukey analyses. \n\nWith regard to the evaluation of difficulty ratings (see Table  ), our 3 \u00d7 2 ANOVA yielded a non-significant effect of diagnosis [  F   = 1.875,   p   = 0.165], a significant effect of condition [  F   = 13.315,   p   = 0.001 ] (mean evaluation for self condition = 1.6820,   SD   = 0.40360), (mean evaluation for other condition = 1.8504,   SD   = 0.47230) and a non-significant interaction between diagnosis and conditions [  F   = 0.752,   p   = 0.477]. \n  \n Evaluation, response time, and Block DESD in each group  . \n  \nWith regard to response time (see Table  ), results yielded a non-significant effect of diagnosis [  F   = 0.319,   p   = 0.729], a non-significant effect of condition [  F   = 2.054,   p   = 0.159] and a non-significant interaction between diagnosis and condition [  F   = 0.593,   p   = 0.557]. \n\n\n### Neuroimaging results \n  \n#### Control group \n  \n  Prime period.

The three objectives of this study were (1) to delineate the neural correlates sustaining mental simulation of actions involving 1PP and 3PP during adolescence; (2) to identify potential atypical neural activations during self-other priming and/or action simulation in hallucination-prone adolescents; (3) to examine whether differential risk for hallucination-proneness (clinical vs. genetic) is also associated with differential impairments in self-related cues and in action simulation. Our findings showed that (1) the Control group activated the key areas involved in   other   related cues when primed for their best friend compared to themselves, and in action simulation performed by others; (2) in the 3PP condition both hallucination-prone groups exhibited decreased activation in the parieto-occipital region, which has been related to self-other distinction of imagined actions (Jeannerod and Anquetil,  ); (3) the priming period for both self and other related cues showed decreased activations in subjects with 22q11.2DS compared to those at clinical risk. \n\nControl group activation patterns during prime and action simulation periods will first be discussed. Then, the unique activations in the AH group and the 22q11.2DS group will be brought into consideration, followed by a discussion concerning the differences between the two hallucination-prone groups. \n\n### Control group \n  \nTypically developing adolescents showed significant increased activations for the \u201cother\u201d condition compared to the \u201cself\u201d condition in both the prime and the action simulation periods. \n\nFor the 3PP, we found increased activations in the PCC and the parieto-occipital regions (see Figure  ). These regions may underlie the influence of visuo-spatial components and episodic memory when adolescents imagine actions performed by their best friend. PCC is involved in the processing of familiar stimuli (Qin and Northoff,  ; Qin et al.,  ), and it has been shown that it plays an important role in memory tasks such as remembering familiar people (Maddock et al.,  ), remembering familiar objects and places (Sugiura et al.,  ) and autobiographical memory (Summerfield et al.,  ; Van Der Meer et al.,  ). The mental simulation of actions may involve the retrieval of memorized visual representations (Farah,  ; Annett,  ) of the imaginary action. \n  \n Activations during 3PP > 1PP contrast in Control group at a statistical threshold of   p   < 0.05  . Slice views at MNI coordinates (  x   = 0,   y   = \u221270,   z   = 25). The bar on the left shows the range of   T  -values. \n  \nAreas in the parieto-occipital region lobe are activated when processing visuo-spatial information in the context of action representation (Kilintari et al.,  ), object-distance representation (Berryhill and Olson,  ), including position and prediction of moving objects (Maus et al.,  ), coherent moving visual motion (McKeefry et al.,  ; Braddick et al.,  ), and motor imagery of hand action (Willems et al.,  ). The 3PP contrast might engage supplementary areas devoted to motion and visuo-spatial information, as an other's perspective implies a shift in visual-spatial perspective (Vogeley et al.,  ). \n\nActivations in the frontal lobe could reflect the self-relevance evaluation of the prime period and the motor cognition aspect of action simulation. For the prime other > prime self contrast, we found significant increased activations in the right superior frontal part of the medial prefrontal cortex and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC (Mayka et al.,  ; Northoff et al.,  ; Murray et al.,  ). These results are consistent with recent findings on self-other related processes in healthy adults. According to a recent meta-analysis, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex DMPFC, DLPFC, and PCC act together in the evaluation and decision-making processes of self versus other relevant information (Van Der Meer et al.,  ). \n\nFor the action simulation period, we obtained significant results in the ventral part of the dorsal premotor cortex (Grezes and Decety,  ; Mayka et al.,  ), the left pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) (Mayka et al.,  ) and the DLPFC. These regions could be recruited by the task's motor aspects. It has been shown that the ventral part of the dorsal premotor cortex plays a role in motor preparation (Hoshi and Tanji,  ), the pre-SMA in maintaining an action representation (Stadler et al.,  ) and the DLPFC in the cognitive control of motor behavior (Passingham,  ; Hoshi,  ; Cieslik et al.,  ). \n\nIn summary, our results showed that the mental simulation of actions performed by others engage increased activations in the posterior midline structure including PCC and the parieto-occipital region. Our results may reflect the visuo-spatial and episodic memory components of self-other discrimination for imagined actions. \n\n\n### Similarities and differences for the AH group and the 22q11.2DS group compared to control group \n  \nBoth hallucination-prone groups showed significant decreased activations for the 3PP > 1PP contrast compared to the control group. The AH group and the 22q11.2DS group presented an atypical pattern of activations in the parieto-occipital region with significant decreased activations in the occipital gyrus BA19 and the precuneus. \n\nAs reviewed above, it has been shown that the right superior occipital BA19 is specifically devoted to 3PP in an action imagery task focusing on a visuo-spatial perspective switch (Jeannerod and Anquetil,  ). According to the authors, the mental simulation of actions performed by others first occurs through a shift in space in order to mentally represent the other's place, and is then followed by the action simulation per se. In this framework, BA 19 would be a key area for self-other distinction by evaluating the difference in spatial localization between oneself and someone else. This interpretation is supported by data demonstrating the role of BA19 in the manipulation of spatial relationships between objects (Haxby et al.,  ; Kosslyn et al.,  ) and further confirmed by a meta-analysis (Zacks,  ). Clinical studies have also shown that posterior parietal lesions provoke visuo-spatial dysfunction (Mendez,  ; Harvey and Rossit,  ) or disturbances in the capacity to represent relative location of objects with respect to the subject (Aguirre and D'Esposito,  ). Recent evidence shows that the parieto-occipital junction responds to both gaze- and body-centered representation when reaching a target visually presented (Bernier and Grafton,  ). This could be an argument in favor of a gaze and body reference computed by parieto-occipital junction during shift in 3PP. \n\nConcerning the 22q11.2DS, Bearden et al. ( ) interestingly detected an decreased cortical thickness in the right parieto-occipital cortex, while to our knowledge, no clear structural alterations have been identified in this region in hallucination-prone subjects (Allen et al.,  ). Moreover, it has been shown that children with 22q11.2DS tend to present significant decreased activation in the parietal and occipital lobe during a visuo-spatial working memory task (Azuma et al.,  ). From a clinical point of view, visuo-spatial impairments have been extensively reported in the syndrome (Wang et al.,  ,  ; Simon et al.,  ; Jacobson et al.,  ). Together, these findings argue in favor of an atypical neuro-development of the parieto-occipital region in 22q11.2DS, which could lead to deficits in visuo-spatial perspective shifting in actions with objects. \n\nThe second region showing decreased activation during 3PP > 1PP contrast for both hallucination-prone groups was located in the right precuneus BA 31 (AH group) and the left precuneus BA7 (22q11.2DS group). In the PET study previously mentioned, Ruby and Decety ( ) found stronger activation bilaterally in the precuneus for 3PP > 1PP, and thus considered the region as specifically involved in distinguishing self and other action imagery. According to their view, the precuneus would play a role in the self's representation with an overactivation during 3PP. The precuneus responds to a wide range of cognitive processes including internal self-representation, episodic memory retrieval, visuo-spatial imagery, 1PP and agency processes (Cavanna and Trimble,  ). The anatomical and connectivity data reviewed by them converges toward a functional subdivision between the anterior (y closer to \u221260 mm) and posterior (y closer to \u221270 mm) precuneus (Cavanna and Trimble,  ). Our results for both the AH group and the 22q11.2DS group correspond to a decreased activation in the posterior region. Importantly when considering left and right disparity between the AH and 22q11.2DS groups no evidence of interhemispheric specialization emerged. Whereas the anterior region responds to self-centered mental imagery strategies, the posterior region is involved in successful episodic memory retrieval (Cabeza and Nyberg,  ; Cavanna and Trimble,  ). Episodic memory relies on the ability to remember past experiences (Tulving,  ) with autobiographical references (Tulving,  ) and plays a role in mental imagery (Tulving,  ; Cabeza and Nyberg,  ; Rubin et al.,  ; Daselaar et al.,  ). Clinical data have pointed out to a link between impaired episodic memory and auditory verbal hallucinations (Seal et al.,  ; Badcock et al.,  ; Berenbaum et al.,  ; Daselaar et al.,  ). \n\nFrom a structural point of view, a significant volume reduction of the parietal lobe has been described in 22q11.2DS (Schaer et al., 2010). Results from functional connectivity also show atypical connectivity involving the left precuneus and PCC regions during resting state (Debbane et al.,  ). Concerning patients with hallucinations however, no clear alterations of the precuneus have been identified as far as we know (Allen et al.,  ). \n\nIn addition to the BA 19 and posterior parietal similarities, the at-risk groups showed unique differences in comparison to the controls. Compared to the control group decreased activation in the left parieto-occipital junction and the right posterior temporal BA39 was found in the 22q11.2DS group, but not in the AH group. This finding might correspond to a diminished salience for other related cues in 22q11.2DS. As mentioned in the last section, posterior parietal cortex, especially the posterior part of the precuneus, is particularly involved in successful retrieval of episodic memory (Wagner et al.,  ; Cavanna and Trimble,  ; Elman et al.,  ) and in remembering familiar people (Maddock et al.,  ). The right temporo-occipital region (BA39) has been implicated in face processing (Puce et al.,  ; Dichter et al.,  ) and in the increased attention to salient social information because of its interactive processing with emotional information (Norris et al.,  ). Interestingly, it has recently been shown that the right temporo-occipital region presents decreased activation in response to affective social versus affective non-social images in schizophrenia (Bjorkquist and Herbener,  ). Clinical data indicates that the 22q11.2DS syndrome exposes to an increased risk of social withdrawal, poor social functioning and emotion recognition deficits (Baker and Skuse,  ; Debbane et al.,  ; Campbell et al.,  ). \n\nIn summary, our results show that both groups at risk (clinical and genetic) for hallucinations exhibited decreased activation in the parieto-occipital region during 3PP compared to the Control group (see Figures   and  ), which has been related to self-other distinction of imagined actions. We suggest that an impaired shift perspective and/or episodic memory dysfunctions might alter self-other distinction in hallucination-prone subjects. Consequently, the lack of reliable representations of the actions performed by others could account for SM action impairments previously observed by Lar\u00f8i et al. ( ) and Debbane et al. ( ). Our results also argue in favor of a decreased salience toward others in the 22q11.2DS, as illustrated by the decreased activations in regions sustaining social cognition and episodic memory. \n  \n Activations during 3PP > 1PP contrast in group comparisons (Control group > AH group) at a statistical threshold of   p   < 0.05  .

The bar on the left shows the range of   T  -values. \n    \n Activations during 3PP > 1PP contrast in group comparisons (Control group > 22q11.2DS group) at MNI coordinates (  x   = 0,   y   = \u221270,   z   = 25)  . Statistical threshold of   p   < 0.05. The bar on the left shows the range of   T  -values. \n  \n\n### At-risk groups: differences between the AH group and the 22q11.2DS group \n  \nWe only obtained results for the prime condition when comparing the AH group and the 22q11.2DS group. This comparison indicated that the salience of self-other priming cues was different between the two groups at-risk for hallucinations, whereas no significant findings emerged for the 1PP and 3PP contrasts. \n\nCompared to the AH group, adolescents with 22q11.2DS exhibited decreased activations of the caudate body, anterior cingulate BA32 and right superior frontal BA 10 for the prime self > prime other contrast. In line with our results, a significant lower level of activation was found in the caudate nucleus and the anterior cingulate cortex during self-reflective processing in adolescents with 22q11.2DS (Schneider et al.,  ). Several meta-analyses have highlighted the role of the anterior cortical midline structure and especially the anterior cingulate cortex in self-specific stimuli processing (Van Der Meer et al.,  ; Murray et al.,  ; Qin et al.,  ). It has also been shown that the caudate nucleus and the anterior cingulate cortex are engaged in reward and personal relevance, i.e., valuing external and internal stimuli with regard to their meaning for the subject (Enzi et al.,  ). \n\nOur results might therefore reflect a decreased salience toward self-related cues in the 22q11.2DS compared to the AH group. The differences between the two groups could be related to neuro-structural alterations in the 22q11.2DS. Indeed reduced volume grey matter and cortical thickness have been described in the anterior cingulate cortex (Dufour et al.,  ; Bearden et al.,  ) and several studies have shown an increased volume of the caudate nucleus (Eliez et al.,  ; Kates et al.,  ; Gothelf et al.,  ). However according to several studies these regions are relatively spared in adolescents and adults with schizotypal traits (Spencer et al.,  ; Moorhead et al.,  ; Ettinger et al.,  ). \n\nCompared to the AH group, adolescents with 22q11.2DS exhibited decreased activations in the right postcentral gyrus BA3 (somatosensory cortex S1) and anterior prefrontal cortex BA10 for prime other > prime self-contrast. The decreased activation of the somatosensory cortex in the 22q11.2DS group for the prime other > prime self contrast is in contradiction with previous work indicating that this region responds specifically to 1PP (Ruby and Decety,  ,  ,  ). In our task however the role of the right somatosensory cortex and the anterior prefrontal cortex BA10 might be related respectively to emotion processing (Adolphs et al.,  ; Pourtois et al.,  ; Hooker et al.,  ; Saxbe et al.,  ) and mental states attribution (Gilbert et al.,  ; Burgess et al.,  ; Benoit et al.,  ). The reduced activations in these regions are in line with clinical evidence showing impairments in cognitive theory of mind tasks in 22q11.2DS (Chow et al.,  ; Campbell et al.,  ; Ho et al.,  ). \n\nIn summary, in comparison to subjects at clinical risk, adolescents with 22q11.2DS showed atypical patterns of activations when primed for themselves and their best friend. More precisely, decreased activations were found in regions involved in self-relevance, emotion processing and attribution. \n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nThe present study must be considered with limitations. First, the restricted sample sizes make it difficult to completely exclude the absence of significant results for the 1PP > 3PP contrasts. Future studies with increased statistical power could address this issue. Concerning the group selection, the 22q11.2DS group had lower IQ scores compared to the Control group. However, the behavioral results showed that response times and difficulty ratings did not significantly differ between groups. This suggests that 22q11.2DS subjects were not put in a more difficult position due to the intellectual deficits they might present. \n\nThe functional imaging paradigm did not include a cognitive control for the prime and action simulation period other than the perspective-taking variants, which could be included in a future version of this paradigm. \n\nFuture studies should address the neurodevelopmental issues of action simulation during adolescence by also comparing children and adults data or data with longitudinal follow-up. More research exploring shift perspective and agency processes may further contribute to a better understanding of action misattribution biases in hallucination-prone subjects. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis study constitutes the preliminary step of a neuroscientific examination targeting the neural correlates of self-other discrimination in mental imagery for hallucination-prone adolescents. We suggest that impairment in the capacity to shift perspective and/or episodic memory dysfunction may alter self-other distinction in hallucination-prone subjects. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nItem 3: \u201cDo you ever hear your own thoughts repeated or echoed?\u201d\tItem 3: \u201cDo you ever hear your own thoughts repeated or echoed?\u201d.1\tItem 3: \u201cDo you ever hear your own thoughts repeated or echoed?\u201d.2\tItem 3: \u201cDo you ever hear your own thoughts repeated or echoed?\u201d.3\tItem 3: \u201cDo you ever hear your own thoughts repeated or echoed?\u201d.4\nItem 7: \u201cDo you ever hear your own thoughts spoken aloud in your head, so that someone near might be able to hear them?\u201d\tItem 7: \u201cDo you ever hear your own thoughts spoken aloud in your head, so that someone near might be able to hear them?\u201d\tItem 7: \u201cDo you ever hear your own thoughts spoken aloud in your head, so that someone near might be able to hear them?\u201d\tItem 7: \u201cDo you ever hear your own thoughts spoken aloud in your head, so that someone near might be able to hear them?\u201d\tItem 7: \u201cDo you ever hear your own thoughts spoken aloud in your head, so that someone near might be able to hear them?\u201d\nItem 11: \u201cDo you ever hear voices commenting on what you are thinking or doing?\u201d\tItem 11: \u201cDo you ever hear voices commenting on what you are thinking or doing?\u201d\tItem 11: \u201cDo you ever hear voices commenting on what you are thinking or doing?\u201d\tItem 11: \u201cDo you ever hear voices commenting on what you are thinking or doing?\u201d\tItem 11: \u201cDo you ever hear voices commenting on what you are thinking or doing?\u201d\nItem 13: \u201cDo you ever hear voices saying words or sentences when there is no one around that might account for it?\u201d\tItem 13: \u201cDo you ever hear voices saying words or sentences when there is no one around that might account for it?\u201d\tItem 13: \u201cDo you ever hear voices saying words or sentences when there is no one around that might account for it?\u201d\tItem 13: \u201cDo you ever hear voices saying words or sentences when there is no one around that might account for it?\u201d\tItem 13: \u201cDo you ever hear voices saying words or sentences when there is no one around that might account for it?\u201d\nItem 28: \u201cHave you ever heard 2 or more unexplained voices talking with each other?\u201d\tItem 28: \u201cHave you ever heard 2 or more unexplained voices talking with each other?\u201d\tItem 28: \u201cHave you ever heard 2 or more unexplained voices talking with each other?\u201d\tItem 28: \u201cHave you ever heard 2 or more unexplained voices talking with each other?\u201d\tItem 28: \u201cHave you ever heard 2 or more unexplained voices talking with each other?\u201d\nItem 32: \u201cDo you ever hear sounds or music that people near you don't hear?\u201d\tItem 32: \u201cDo you ever hear sounds or music that people near you don't hear?\u201d\tItem 32: \u201cDo you ever hear sounds or music that people near you don't hear?\u201d\tItem 32: \u201cDo you ever hear sounds or music that people near you don't hear?\u201d\tItem 32: \u201cDo you ever hear sounds or music that people near you don't hear?\u201d\n\tCAPS mean sum selected items\tCAPS mean selected items distress\tCAPS mean selected items frequency\tCAPS mean selected items intrusiveness\nControl group\t0\t\t\t\nAH group\t2.25 (1.91)\t2.66 (1.25)\t1.77 (0.66)\t2.78 1.10\n22q11.2DS group\t0.54 (0.47)\t2.71 (1.89)\t2.79 (1.81)\t2.38 (1.60)\n### Caption\nCAPS selected items for auditory hallucinations (Bell et al., 2006;

However, it is unclear whether these parameters distinctively map onto different brain networks obtained from intrinsic functional connectivity, which organizes slowly fluctuating ongoing brain activity. In our study, 31 demographically homogeneous healthy young participants performed whole- and partial-report tasks and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Report accuracy was modeled using TVA to estimate, individually, the four TVA parameters. Networks encompassing cortical areas relevant for visual attention were derived from independent component analysis of rs-fMRI data: visual, executive control, right and left frontoparietal, and ventral and dorsal attention networks. Two TVA parameters were mapped on particular functional networks. First, participants with higher (vs. lower) visual processing speed showed lower functional connectivity within the ventral attention network. Second, participants with more (vs. less) efficient top-down control showed higher functional connectivity within the dorsal attention network and lower functional connectivity within the visual network. Additionally, higher performance was associated with higher functional connectivity between networks: specifically, between the ventral attention and right frontoparietal networks for visual processing speed, and between the visual and executive control networks for top-down control. The higher inter-network functional connectivity was related to lower intra-network connectivity. These results demonstrate that separable visual attention parameters that are assumed to constitute relatively stable traits correspond distinctly to the functional connectivity both within and between particular functional networks. This implies that individual differences in basic attention functions are represented by differences in the coherence of slowly fluctuating brain activity. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSeparable visual attention functions are assumed to rely on distinct but interacting neural mechanisms (Posner and Petersen,  ; Desimone and Duncan,  ; Bundesen et al.,  ). The computational \u201ctheory of visual attention\u201d (TVA, Bundesen,  ) permits a set of independent parameters to be estimated that reflect individuals' attentional capacity (i.e., visual processing speed and short-term memory storage capacity) and selectivity (i.e., top-down control and spatial laterality). These TVA parameters have been suggested to constitute traits that characterize individuals' speed and efficiency of attentional selection processes (Finke et al.,  ). The relationship between these parameters and the basic organization of the brain has mainly been examined in local lesion studies. Thus, for example, reduced visual processing speed has been associated with temporoparietal junction (Peers et al.,  ) and lateral thalamic non-traumatic lesions (Kraft et al.,  ), as well as with a parietal white-matter reduction in posterior cortical atrophy (Neitzel et al.,  ). A lateral spatial bias has been documented following medial thalamic lesions (Kraft et al.,  ) as well as asymmetric parietal hypometabolism induced by early Alzheimer's disease (Sorg et al.,  ). Studies on the neural organization of these parameters in the healthy brain are comparatively rare. A structural connectivity analysis revealed visual short-term memory (VSTM) capacity to be associated with the organization of the superior longitudinal and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi (Chechlacz et al.,  ). Top-down control was found to be associated with task-related functional connectivity among parietal areas (Vossel et al.,  ). Taken together, these findings imply that TVA parameters closely reflect the integrity of attention-relevant brain areas and their connections, including their functional interactions. It remains, however, unknown whether and how these parameters map onto functional networks overlapping those attention-relevant areas. \n\nFunctional networks that include regions relevant for visual attention have been identified based on their intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) (Fox et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ; Allen et al.,  ; Yeo et al.,  ; Raichle,  ). Intrinsic FC represents the correlation, among different brain regions, of infra-slowly (i.e., 0.01\u20130.1 Hz) ongoing blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal intensity fluctuations obtained from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Fox and Raichle,  ; Raichle,  ). Such fluctuations reflect the dynamics of slowly propagating activity including cortical neuronal excitability (Wu et al.,  ; Matsui et al.,  ), linked with faster oscillatory activity by cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling (Mantini et al.,  ; He et al.,  ; Brookes et al.,  ; Hipp et al.,  ). Intrinsic FC provides relevant information on both brain-evoked activity (Mennes et al.,  ) and behavior (Markett et al.,  ; Rosenberg et al.,  ,  ). Crucially, the brain networks identified through intrinsic FC are stable both within (Zuo et al.,  ) and across subjects (Damoiseaux et al.,  ; De Luca et al.,  ), and largely correspond to structural connectivity (Damoiseaux and Greicius,  ; Honey et al.,  ). These characteristics collectively suggest the possibility of a distinctive correspondence between specific, separable visual attention functions and particular intrinsic brain networks. \n\nHere we examined whether and how independent visual attention parameters obtained from modeling using TVA are mapped onto distinct functional networks derived from intrinsic FC. Crucially, to avoid potential confounding by structural integrity or visual attention changes inherent in patient or developing populations, we examined an age-homogeneous group of healthy participants. Moreover, following the neural interpretation of TVA (Bundesen et al.,  ), we focused on networks that comprise brain regions relevant for visual attention (for a review, see Parks and Madden,  ). White matter pathways might anatomically constrain functional network connectivity (Parks and Madden,  ), albeit not in a one-to-one fashion (Damoiseaux and Greicius,  ). Accordingly, based on the results of previous TVA-based studies relating individual variability in attention functions to variability in structural connectivity (e.g., Chechlacz et al.,  ), we expected to find a positive association between TVA parameter estimates and intrinsic FC. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThirty-two healthy young subjects (25\u201327 years old) participated in this study. The \u201cKlinikum rechts der Isar's\u201d Ethics Committee approved the study, which was conducted in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants gave written informed consent and were paid for their participation. All participants underwent BOLD-fMRI during rest and TVA-based assessment in separate sessions conducted on the same day (though one participant did not perform the TVA partial-report task and thus had to be excluded from the analyses). All had a normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and normal color vision. Before visual attention and MRI examination, participants were assessed for global cognitive functioning by trained psychologists using a short version of the German Wechsler Adult Intelligence scale-III (WAIS-III) (Von Aster et al.,  ), permitting computation of Full-Scale IQ. Demographic information is listed in Table  . Males and females did not differ in any of the demographic variables. \n  \nDemographic variables. \n  \n Mean \u00b1 standard deviations are shown  . \n  \n\n### Parametric assessment and estimation of visual attention functions \n  \n#### General procedure \n  \nThe general TVA-based procedure for assessing visual attention functioning has been described in detail elsewhere (e.g., Finke et al.,  ). Briefly, to assess visual attention functions, participants performed, in a balanced order, whole- and partial-report tasks that lasted ~0.5 h each. Within a trial, a central white cross (0.3\u00b0 visual angle) appeared for 300 ms, followed by a 100-ms gap after which the task-relevant stimuli were presented (Figure  ). Stimuli comprised of red or green letters (0.5\u00b0 high \u00d7 0.4\u00b0 wide) randomly chosen from a pre-specified set (\u201cABEFHJKLMNPRSTWXYZ\u201d). Letters were generally terminated by masks (each composed of a square with a star inside), effectively overwriting iconic memory traces of the stimulus array (see below). Note though that trials without post-display masks were introduced in the whole-report task in order to increase the variability of \u201ceffective\u201d exposure times (by allowing for an additional component of iconic memory buffering; Sperling,  ) and thus ensure reliable and valid TVA parameter estimation. Stimuli were presented on a 17-inch monitor (1,024 by 1,280 pixel screen resolution, 60-Hz refresh rate), in a dimly lit room. \n  \nWhole- (  left  ) and partial-report (  right  ) tasks used to assess and estimate visual attention functions. In the partial-report task, targets (T) are presented in red, and distracters (D) in green. \n  \n\n#### Visual attention capacity parameters \n  \nCapacity parameters were derived from report accuracy in the whole-report task (Figure  , left), in which participants were instructed to report all letters they were fairly sure they had seen. First, in a pretest (24 trials), one individualized exposure duration was determined as the presentation time required to report one letter on average over several trials correctly. Shorter and longer exposure durations were then determined based on that value. Next, the three durations were used to present stimuli either unmasked or immediately followed by masking stimuli, thus resulting in six effective exposure durations (for more details, see Finke et al.,  ). The average short, intermediate, and long exposure durations were, respectively, 45.17 (  SD   = 7.0), 82.23 (  SD   = 17.26), and 164.90 (  SD   = 33.40) ms. The task consisted of 192 trials presented in 4 blocks of 48 trials each. Within each block, trials were randomized and presented equally often under 12 conditions (2 masking conditions [no masks, post-display masks] \u00d7 3 exposure durations \u00d7 2 hemifields). Performance accuracy (i.e., the number of letters reported correctly) was measured as a function of the effective exposure duration. Based on TVA, an exponential growth function was used to model the probability of selecting an object (Bundesen,  ; Kyllingsbaek,  ). The slope of the exponential curve at the minimum effective exposure duration   t0   (for masked displays) reflects the processing rate   C  \u2014or number of elements processed per second\u2014and the asymptote indicates the VSTM storage capacity\u2014or the maximum number of items that can be simultaneously represented in VSTM. The effective additional exposure duration in unmasked displays (or parameter   m  \u03bc) attributable to iconic memory buffering was also determined to validly estimate parameters   C   and   K  . Even though   m  \u03bc was of no further interest in our study, it was necessary to estimate because, in unmasked displays, retention of visual traces in iconic memory allows for prolonged information processing (Finke et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Visual attention weighting parameters \n  \nAttentional weighting parameters were derived from report accuracy in the partial-report task (Figure  , right), in which participants had to report targets (red letters) and ignore distractors (green letters). On each trial, (a) a single target, (b) a target and a distractor, or (c) two targets were presented horizontally or vertically at the corners of an imaginary square (for more details, see Finke et al.,  ). As in the whole-report task, the individual exposure duration was determined in a pretest (32 trials) as the duration at which the participant reported single targets with 80% accuracy. The average exposure duration was 91.50 ms (  SD   = 23.42). The task consisted of 6 blocks of 48 trials each (i.e., 288 trials in total). In contrast to the whole-report task, the stimuli were always followed by a mask under 16 conditions (4 single target conditions, 8 target plus distractor conditions, and 4 dual target conditions). From the probabilities of target report, attentional weights were separately derived for targets and distractors, and for each visual hemifield, based on TVA. The selectivity of attentional weighting, or top-down control \u03b1, was estimated as the ratio of the attentional weights allocated to targets to the weights assigned to distractors. Lower \u03b1 values would then indicate high selectivity or preference for targets (i.e., more efficient top-down control), whereas higher values would indicate less selective processing. In turn, the spatial distribution of attention across visual hemifields, or spatial laterality   w  , was defined as   w  / (  w   +   w  ), where   w   indicates the attentional weight allocated to the left visual hemifield and   w   the attentional weight allocated to the right visual hemifield. A value of 0.5 indicates balanced weighting, whereas values above or below 0.5 would be indicative of, respectively, left- or right-ward spatial laterality (Finke et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n### Resting-state fMRI \n  \n#### Imaging data acquisition \n  \nImaging data were acquired on a 3T MR scanner (Achieva TX, Philips, Netherlands) with an 8-channel phase-array head coil. Participants lay comfortably with their heads surrounded by soft foams to reduce head motion. Before starting the functional data acquisition, participants were instructed to close their eyes but avoid falling asleep (i.e., resting state), and we checked with them at the end of the sequence that they had actually stayed awake. Functional data were collected across 10 min 52 s during resting state, and comprised 250 T2 -weighted volumes using a gradient-echo echo-planar sequence:   TR   = 2,608 ms;   TE   = 35 ms; flip angle = 90\u00b0; FOV = 230 mm ; matrix size = 64 \u00d7 63, 41 slices with 3.58 mm thickness and no interslice gap; reconstructed voxel size = 3.59 mm isotropic. Structural data were obtained from a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence:   TR   = 7.71 ms;   TE   = 3.93 ms; flip angle = 15\u00b0; field of view (FOV) = 256 mm ; matrix = 256 \u00d7 256, 180 slices; voxel size = 1 mm . \n\n\n#### Imaging data preprocessing \n  \nThe imaging data were preprocessed using the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF; Chao-Gan and Yu-Feng,  ), a toolbox in MATLAB (R2013a, version 8.1.0.604; The Mathworks Inc.; Natick, MA, USA). Briefly, the preprocessing included realignment, reorientation to the AC-PC axis of functional and structural images; segmentation of the structural T1-weighted image and co-registration of the segmented T1-weighted and the T2*-weighted functional images. No participant had to be excluded based on excessive head motion, which was defined as cumulative translation or rotation larger than 3 mm or 3\u00b0, or mean point-to-point translation or rotation greater than 0.15 mm or 0.1\u00b0. Six head motion parameters, as well as white matter, CSF, and global signals were entered as nuisance covariates and regressed out from the functional data. Next, functional images were normalized into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using unified segmentation of T1 image (Ashburner and Friston,  ), and resampled to 2-mm isotropic voxel size to keep the highest resolution possible. The normalized images were then smoothed using a 4-mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. \n\n\n#### Independent component and dual regression analyses \n  \nPreprocessed data were temporally concatenated and analyzed by probabilistic independent component analysis (ICA) as implemented in FSL (version 5.0.7) using MELODIC version 3.14 (Beckmann and Smith,  ; Smith et al.,  ). A low dimensionality (i.e., 20 independent components) was chosen to decompose the data into more spatially extended components reflecting intrinsic brain networks (Smith et al.,  ). \n\nTo obtain estimates of independent components for each participant, we performed a dual regression analysis (Beckmann et al.,  ; Filippini et al.,  ) using the group-independent components generated in the group ICA as input. Dual-regression analysis permits quantifying, for each subject, the FC of each voxel with each group-independent component while controlling for all other components (some of which represent artifacts) (Smith et al.,  ). Crucially for our study, dual-regression analysis is superior in detecting individual variability in FC compared to traditional approaches, such as seed-based analysis (Smith et al.,  ). Finally, FSL's   randomize   permutation-testing tool, based on 500 permutations and a   p  -value of 0.05, was used to obtain group spatial maps. \n\nThe individual networks for each participant included voxel-wise Z-scores or standardized parameter estimates (by the residual within-subject noise) obtained from the second stage of the dual regression (for details, e.g., Smith et al.,  ). In other words, each map contained voxel-wise information on the particular contribution to an independent component while controlling for the influence of its contribution to all the other components (Filippini et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ). Thus, for each participant, we obtained 20 individual maps (one for each component), with the Z-score of every voxel, within each map, indicating how closely that voxel's time course resembled that of the respective group component. These individual voxel-wise Z-maps were further used for group statistics, in which group differences could manifest in any brain region belonging to the independent component, irrespective of whether or not that region is   typically   included in the brain network that the independent component represents (Smith et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Selection of intrinsic brain networks for further statistical analysis \n  \nThe particular choice of networks on which we focused our analyses was based on both the neural interpretation of TVA (Bundesen et al.,  ) and the standard templates for intrinsic brain networks reported in the resting-state fMRI literature (e.g., Allen et al.,  ; Yeo et al.,  ). However, to establish a correspondence between distinct visual attention parameters and distinct intrinsic brain networks, we first needed to ensure that the relative independence among the networks was comparable to that amongst the different TVA parameters. For this reason, we chose ICA over, for instance, a seed-based approach: as a multivariate approach, ICA yields a set of statistically independent sources or components (Beckmann and Smith,  ); and as a data-driven approach, it can remove the noise (e.g., both physiological and scanner-related) from the data (Zuo et al.,  ). \n\nTo select independent components representing intrinsic brain networks assumed to play a role in visual attention, we first identified relevant intrinsic networks by referring to typical networks described previously. In detail, to automatically select independent components reflecting intrinsic networks, we conducted multiple spatial cross-correlations with templates derived from FC based on resting-state fMRI of 1,000 healthy subjects (Yeo et al.,  ), in which a 7-network parcellation of the cortex was found robust, including visual, dorsal and ventral attention, and frontoparietal networks. It should be noted that the labeling of these networks\u2014though fitting in the context of attention research\u2014is somewhat arbitrary, as these networks are also involved in other cognitive functions (Smith et al.,  ), that is, there is no one-to-one mapping between intrinsic networks and function. After that, we chose the networks that best covered regions proposed by neural TVA to contribute to visual attention functions (i.e., frontal, parietal, limbic, and occipital; Bundesen et al.,  ), in particular: the visual, executive control, lateralized frontoparietal, and ventral and dorsal attention networks. To be independent of the special parcellation approach used by Yeo and colleagues for intrinsic networks (i.e., clustering), we considered it reasonable to compare our spatial maps with network templates obtained using ICA. Thus, we conducted further spatial cross-correlations but with intrinsic brain network templates derived from an ICA approach based on the resting-state fMRI data of 603 healthy subjects (Allen et al.,  ). We found the chosen networks to exhibit the greatest overlap with frontoparietal and occipital-visual networks (i.e., IC60, IC72, IC55, IC34, IC64, and IC27 of Allen et al.,  ) that have been related to attention functions previously (e.g., Corbetta and Shulman,  ; Fox et al.,  ; Dosenbach et al.,  ,  ; Vincent et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ; Finke et al.,  ), thus confirming our selection of attention-relevant brain networks. Note that ICA-derived spatial maps can have a larger extension and include more regions than those classically associated with a specific network (e.g., Smith et al.,  ), without compromising the reliability of the method (e.g., Zuo et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \n#### Intra-network differences in functional connectivity between performance groups \n  \nTo examine for intra-network differences in functional connectivity, we took the individual versions of the previously selected networks from the results of the second stage of the dual-regression analysis (i.e., temporal regression; for details, e.g., Smith et al.,  ). First, based on the individual TVA parameter estimates, the group median was calculated separately for each of the parameters and used to split the sample into \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d performers (for parameters visual processing speed   C  , visual short-term memory capacity   K  , and top-down control \u03b1) and left- and right-preference (for parameter spatial laterality   w  ). Next, we tested for differences in intrinsic FC in visual attention-relevant brain networks between the groups based on the median splits using Statistical Parametric Mapping, SPM8 ( ). Specifically, using a second-level (i.e., group) general linear model, we predicted each voxel's intra-network FC (within each visual attention-relevant network) from TVA performance (i.e., performance-based subgroups of the variable of interest), controlling for the remaining three TVA parameters and for education and gender (i.e., variables of no interest). \n\nBecause our goal was to systematically examine whether and how distinct TVA parameters are independently mapped onto distinct functional networks of the healthy brain, we performed six (i.e., one for each brain network) two-sample   t  -tests for each TVA parameter of interest. In the general linear model, intra-network FC was predicted from 7 parameters (i.e., 24 degrees of freedom). We contrasted the first two parameters, which correspond to the two levels of the main variable \u201cperformance-based subgroup\u201d (i.e., \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d performers). Within each group, the images included the individual network-specific Z-maps derived from dual regression; each voxel within each of these maps took on a value indicating how close its time course reflected the group component's time course. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons (  p   < 0.05 FWE-corrected at the cluster level, voxel-wise height threshold   p   < 0.001) and only results surviving the additional Bonferroni corrections at the network level (i.e.,   p   0.05/6 networks = 0.0083) were considered further. \n\nWe chose a median split over a linear regression approach, for the following reasons. First, given the strong homogeneity of our sample regarding demographics, brain integrity, and behavior, we had no reasons to expect robust linear relationships between the voxel-wise intrinsic FC and the TVA parameters. Second, as previous TVA-based studies on small healthy samples had revealed significant differences between high and low performers in experimental manipulations (e.g., Finke et al.,  ) or brain measures (e.g., Wiegand et al.,  ), we wanted to keep our analyses and results comparable to these studies. Third, TVA parameters have been proposed to reflect relatively stable characteristics of a given individual (e.g., Finke et al.,  ; Habekost,  ). Given this, we can assume that our median split-defined groups are random samples of \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d performers from the population. Finally, the independence of TVA parameters is given mathematically (Bundesen,  ) and empirically (Habekost et al.,  ), which reduces the probability (Iacobucci et al.,  ) of Type I errors (Maxwell and Delaney,  ). Note that, in our sample too, we did not find significant relationships between the different parameters:   p   > 0.072. \n\n\n#### Inter-network differences in functional connectivity between performance groups \n  \nTo examine for inter-network differences in functional connectivity, we took the results of the first stage of the dual regression (i.e., spatial regression; for details, e.g., Smith et al.,  ) and analyzed them using custom code written in MATLAB. For each participant, we correlated the time courses of the six independent components of interest and performed Fisher r-to-z transformation. Next, we tested whether the inter-network FC was significantly higher for \u201chigh\u201d than for \u201clow\u201d performers. Finally, we examined whether intra-network FC correlated with inter-network FC. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Visual attention parameters \n  \nMean TVA parameter estimates for the entire sample, as well as separately for each performance and spatial laterality preference group are listed in Table  . Note that for the spatial laterality parameter   w  , the group mean did not differ from the value of 0.5, which indicates optimally balanced attention [  t   = \u22120.569,   p   = 0.573]. Males and females did not differ significantly in any of the TVA parameter estimates (data not shown; all   p   > 0.179). The TVA parameters did not significantly correlate with each other (all   p   > 0.072; see Table   for pairwise correlations). Furthermore, except for a significant correlation between processing speed   C   and IQ (  r   = 0.37,   p   = 0.039), they also did not significantly correlate with any of the demographic variables in the entire sample (all other   p   > 0.135). The group medians for the four TVA parameters used to split the sample are listed in Table  . Importantly, the resulting groups differed exclusively in the TVA parameter of interest and not in any of the other TVA parameters, education, age, IQ, or gender [  C  :   t   = 5.382,   p   < 0.0001, all other covariates:   p   > 0.150;   K  :   t   = 6.634,   p   < 0.00001, all other covariates:   p   > 0.108; \u03b1:   t   = \u22129.308,   p   < 0.00001, all other covariates:   p   > 0.184;   w  :   t   = \u22126.764,   p   < 0.00001, all other covariates:   p   > 0.191]. It is worth noting that only six participants (five males and one female) were always classified as \u201chigh\u201d (three) or \u201clow\u201d (three) performers for   C, K  , and \u03b1. These participants did not differ in any demographic or TVA variable from the rest of the sample (  p   > 0.506). Thus, our participants have a distinct profile in terms of the different parameters, instead of exhibiting a more general, either \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cpoor,\u201d visual attention performance. Importantly, this corroborates the independence assumption maintained for the TVA parameters (e.g., Habekost et al.,  ) and indicates that the median split approach can be validly applied here. \n  \nTVA parameter estimates. \n  \n Mean \u00b1 standard deviation are shown  . \n\n Md, Median value used to split the groups  . \n    \nPairwise correlations among TVA parameters. \n  \n TVA parameters: C, visual processing speed; K, visual short-term memory storage capacity; \u03b1, top-down control; w , spatial laterality  . \n  \n\n### Selection of brain networks relevant for visual attention \n  \nSix components that comprised occipital, lateral frontal and parietal, and limbic regions were selected as relevant for visual attention out of 12 functionally relevant components (Figure  ). These components were cross-correlated with the templates of Yeo et al. ( ) as well as with the ICA-based 28 network templates of Allen et al. ( ), and those with the highest coefficients were selected as networks (e.g., IC3:   r   = 0.57 with IC60 of Allen et al.; IC4:   r   = 0.40 with IC72; IC6:   r   = 0.49 with IC55; IC7:   r   = 0.34 with IC34; IC11:   r   = 0.43 with IC64; and IC18:   r   = 0.45 with IC27). \n  \nVisual attention-relevant brain networks selected from 20 components obtained from independent component (IC) analysis and dual regression of resting-state BOLD-fMRI data of 31 healthy young participants. The spatial maps represent voxels significantly belonging to each network (  p   < 0.05, FWE-corrected) and are overlaid onto an anatomical high-resolution brain-extracted template in MNI space (Holmes et al.,  ; Rorden and Brett,  ; MRIcron). The labels just serve to identify them and follow conventional names given in the literature. \n  \nThe components shown in Figure   comprise the IC11 or \u201cvisual\u201d network, mainly encompassing occipital clusters on the lingual gyri and calcarine sulci, as well as clusters on the right middle frontal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus bilaterally. The IC18 or \u201cexecutive control\u201d network included temporal and frontal clusters bilaterally on the superior and middle temporal gyrus, and the inferior frontal and precentral gyri, as well as on the precuneus and calcarine sulci. The IC3 or \u201cright frontoparietal\u201d network comprised parietal clusters bilaterally on the inferior parietal lobule, superior and middle temporal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus, as well as on the left cerebellum and left calcarine sulcus. For IC7 or \u201cleft frontoparietal\u201d network, clusters were observed mainly in left frontal and parietal areas, including the inferior frontal gyrus, intraparietal sulcus, as well as in the right cerebellum, and left and inferior temporal gyri. The IC6 or \u201cventral attention\u201d network included bilateral frontoinsular regions such as the insula, anterior and middle cingulate cortex, middle frontal gyrus, as well as bilateral regions of the cerebellum, the thalamus, and the caudate nucleus, and of parieto-occipital areas. Finally, the IC4 or \u201cdorsal attention\u201d network was formed by bilateral parietal clusters of the precuneus, superior and inferior parietal lobules, supramarginal gyrus, as well as middle and inferior temporal, superior frontal, precentral, and fusiform gyri, and cerebellum. \n\n\n### Intra-network differences in functional connectivity between performance groups \n  \nBased on our approach of median splits of a group of healthy participants, we observed voxel-wise intrinsic FC group differences in three particular attention-relevant brain networks (Table  ). With respect to capacity parameters, we found significant group differences for visual processing speed   C   in the ventral attention network, but no significant differences for VSTM capacity   K  . With regard to weighting parameters, we found significant group differences for top-down control \u03b1 in the dorsal attention and visual networks. In addition, for spatial laterality   w  , we found significant differences in the right frontoparietal network\u2014though this result did not survive Bonferroni correction at the network level (Table  ). In more detail, the group with relatively higher visual processing speed showed lower intrinsic FC of the right middle frontal gyrus in the ventral attention network (Figure  ). Moreover, the group with more efficient top-down control showed higher FC of the right precuneus in the dorsal attention network and lower FC of the right calcarine sulcus in the visual network. \n  \nGroup differences in intrinsic FC between subgroups defined according to TVA parameters. \n  \n L, Left; R, Right  . \n\n All p values are corrected for Family-Wise Error (FWE)  . \n    \nGroup differences in intrinsic functional connectivity (FC). The group with higher visual processing speed   C   estimates showed lower FC of the right middle frontal gyrus within a ventral attention network (  left part  ). The group with better top-down control \u03b1 estimates showed both higher FC of the right precuneus within a dorsal attention (  middle part  ) and lower connectivity of the right calcarine sulcus within a visual network (  right part  ). Significant clusters (in red) are overlaid onto the respective group spatial maps of Figure   (in yellow). Below these maps, respective group differences can be observed with respect to the Eigenvariate or average FC of the networks. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean. Significant clusters have FWE-corrected   p   < 0.0083. Red bars show   t  -values (see also Table  ). \n  \nTo account for possible differences in, for instance, noise levels between groups, we calculated the temporal signal-to-noise ratio of the realigned fMRI time series and repeated the analyses including the individual temporal signal-to-noise ratio as a covariate in the model. For the ventral attention and visual networks, the differences between groups remained the same [  t   = 4.74,   p   = 0.008,   k   = 60 voxels for the ventral attention network, and   t   = 6.49,   p   = 0.001,   k   = 129 voxels for the visual network; same cluster peaks for both as in Table  ]. For the dorsal attention network, the difference was slightly reduced, but still significant [  t   = 6.26,   p   = 0.013,   k   = 33 voxels]. Thus, group differences are unlikely attributable to systematic differences in signal quality. Differences in motion might still drive differences between groups. Given this, following (Smith et al.,  ), we checked whether performance groups differed in mean volume-to-volume head motion (e.g., Power et al.,  ), but we observed no significant differences: visual processing speed   C  :   t   = 0.82,   p   = 0.419; VSTM capacity   K  :   t   = 1.62,   p   = 0.113; top-down control:   t   = 0.47,   p   = 0.639; spatial laterality:   t   = 0.22,   p   = 0.826. As a further measure to ensure data quality (e.g., Smith et al.,  ), we checked participants with relatively extreme values in (a) the temporal signal-to-noise ratio, (b) the mean volume-to-volume head motion in mm, and (c) the proportion of outlier volumes. An extreme value was flagged if it was above or below the upper or, respectively, lower 5th percentile of the distribution of values in (a), (b), or (c). Two data points were flagged as extreme [< 9.39 in (a); > 0.26 in (b), and > 0.08 in (c)]. Excluding both participants slightly reduced the differences, which however remained significant (see Table   for comparison) [visual processing speed   C  :   t   = 5.45,   p   = 0.009,   k   = 59 voxels, peak = 38, 52, 18; top-down control \u03b1: dorsal attention network:   t   = 6.10,   p   = 0.022,   k   = 29, same peak; and visual network:   t   = 6.68,   p   < 0.0001,   k   = 165, peak: 8, \u221274, 10]. \n\n\n### Directionality of functional connectivity differences \n  \nBased on the results of previous research on structural connectivity and individual variability in attention functions (e.g., Chechlacz et al.,  ), we had expected high performers to show high, rather than low, intra-network FC. Consequently, we decided to also explore   inter  -network FC (i.e., among brain networks) to better understand the finding of a relatively lower intra-network FC (i.e., among brain regions within one network) in \u201chigh\u201d compared to \u201clow\u201d performers. More specifically, we wanted to ascertain whether or not a higher   inter  -network FC is observed for the visual and ventral attention networks (i.e., those with lower   intra  -network FC) in high performers. Inter-network FC has been shown to vary among individuals, with this variation associated with attention performance (Kelly et al.,  ). Thus, we expected to find a difference also in inter-network FC between high and low performers. Moreover, the strength of the negative relationship between \u201ctask-positive\u201d networks (such as the attention-relevant networks) and \u201ctask-negative\u201d networks (such as the default-mode network, known to deactivate during task conditions) has been associated with more consistent behavioral performance (Kelly et al.,  ). Thus, we hypothesized a   positive   relationship among our \u201ctask-positive\u201d networks for high performers. Finally, we determined whether a   high   inter-network FC is related to the   low   intra-network FC of the visual and ventral attention networks. \n\n\n### Inter-network differences in functional connectivity between performance groups \n  \nHere, we examined whether the inter-network FC would be significantly higher for \u201chigh\u201d than for \u201clow\u201d performers in the visual and ventral attention networks and whether a lower intra-network FC would correlate significantly with higher inter-network FC\u2014as hypothesized. \n\nTo start with, the correlation matrix of the   Z   values (i.e., r-to-z transformation), averaged across the entire sample, is presented in Figure   to illustrate the inter-network FC. Next, Figure   depicts a group matrix for both visual processing speed   C   (left) and top-down control \u03b1 (right), summarizing significant differences in inter-network FC between high and low performers. We only tested differences in the ventral attention network for visual processing speed, and in the visual network for top-down control (vector framed by white)\u2014because, in both cases, the respective intra-network FC was lower for high compared to low performers. We found only the inter-network FC of the ventral attention network with the right frontoparietal network to be significantly higher in the group with higher visual processing speed   C   estimates (mean   Z  -values for high vs. low performers, 0.269 vs. 0.116,   t   = 1.685,   p   = 0.051, 1-tailed). For top-down control, only the inter-network FC of the visual network with the executive control network was significantly higher in the group with better (i.e., lower) top-down control \u03b1 estimates (mean   Z  -values for better vs. poorer performers, 0.020 vs. \u22120.111,   t   = 1.895,   p   = 0.030, 1-tailed). These results, however, do not survive Bonferroni correction (i.e.,   p   = 0.01). \n  \nInter-network functional connectivity (FC) among visual-attention relevant networks. One-sample   t  -test results (  q   < 0.05 FDR corrected for multiple comparisons) of the correlations among components on one side of a symmetrical matrix (below the diagonal line). Significant correlations are color-coded in warm (positive) and cool (negative) colors, whereas non-significant correlations are coded in turquoise. Spatial maps of components are depicted in Figure  . The color bar shows mean Fisher r-to-z transformed values. \n    \nVisual processing speed (  left  ) and top-down control (  right  ) matrices showing   t  -values of high vs. low performance group differences. Higher inter-network functional connectivity (FC) values of the ventral attention (  left  ), and visual (  right  ) networks with the other networks were tested for the high performance group of speed and top-down control, respectively. The inter-network FC of the ventral attention network with the right frontoparietal network was significantly higher for the group with higher visual processing speed   C  . The inter-network FC of the visual network with the executive control network was significantly higher for the group with better top-down control \u03b1. The color bar shows   t   values (  df   = 29, high vs. low,   p   < 0.05). \n  \nThe observed high inter-network FC in high performers could explain the low intra-network FC. To test for this possibility, we computed the correlation between intra-network FC in the ventral attention and visual networks and inter-network FC of these networks with the right frontoparietal and executive control networks, respectively (while controlling for the intra-network FC of the right frontoparietal and executive control networks, respectively). We found a trend toward a negative correlation for the ventral attention network (  r   = \u22120.28,   p   = 0.069), and a significant negative correlation (  r   = \u22120.31,   p   = 0.045) for the visual network. This pattern indicates that high inter-network FC could indeed explain the observed low intra-network FC in high performers. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe examined whether and how visual attention parameters derived from TVA-based model fitting that are assumed to represent latent traits underlying the individual efficiency of the visual selection process are mapped onto distinct brain networks obtained from intrinsic functional connectivity (FC). We divided the sample into groups of high and low performers for each relevant TVA parameter and compared the FC of networks that encompass cortical regions relevant for visual attention. \n\nFirst, we found significant intra-network FC group differences for two TVA parameters. Participants with higher, vs. those with lower, visual processing speed exhibited lower FC of the right middle frontal gyrus within the ventral attention network. Furthermore, participants with more efficient, versus those with less efficient, top-down control exhibited higher FC of the right precuneus within the dorsal attention network and lower FC of the right calcarine sulcus within the visual network. \n\nSecond, we found that for those networks for which participants with superior attentional performance showed lower   intra  -network FC than those with inferior performance, the same participants also showed higher   inter  -network FC. More precisely, significantly higher inter-network FC was found for the ventral attention network with the right frontoparietal network in the group with higher compared to that with lower processing speed. For top-down control, significantly higher inter-network FC was found for the visual network with the executive control network in the group with more efficient compared to that with less efficient top-down control. Our results demonstrate for the first time a distinctive correspondence between particular visual attention parameters and FC of different brain networks. These results thus contribute to the evidence that, in healthy participants, relatively stable individual differences in attention functions are reflected in similarly stable differences in intrinsic FC. \n\n### Visual attention capacity parameters \n  \n#### Visual processing speed   C   and the ventral attention network \n  \nOur finding of a linkage between visual processing speed and FC within the ventral attention network, and particularly in the right middle frontal gyrus, points to a role of this frontoparietal, limbic network for the rate of visual information uptake. As the ventral attention network has been previously documented to be relevant for tonic alertness (e.g., Sadaghiani et al.,  ; Sestieri et al.,  ; Coste and Kleinschmidt,  ), the current result is in agreement with theoretical proposals (Bundesen et al.,  ) and empirical evidence (Matthias et al.,  ; Finke et al.,  ; Vangkilde et al.,  ; Petersen et al.,  ; Wiegand et al.,  ) for a close link between alertness and visual processing speed. \n\nFurther support for this link is provided by our additional finding (although uncorrected for multiple comparisons) of higher inter-network FC between the ventral attention and the right frontoparietal network. Right-sided brain regions have generally been implicated in the maintenance of an alert state under conditions without external warning cues (i.e., tonic alertness) and with increased time on task (i.e., vigilance) (e.g., Pardo et al.,  ; Sturm and Willmes,  ). In healthy individuals, the right middle frontal gyrus has been shown to exhibit higher activity during maintenance of an alert state (Sturm et al.,  ), as well as higher spontaneous activity during high degrees of tonic alertness, as measured by pupil size changes (Schneider et al.,  ). Moreover, in patients with tonic alertness deficits following right-sided ventral lesions, tonic alertness training leads to an increase in the activity of the right middle frontal gyrus (Thimm et al.,  ). Similarly, stroke damage to areas in the right mid-frontal lobe, often involved in the neglect syndrome, can also produce deficits in sustained attention (Husain and Rorden,  ). Finally, evidence from structural connectivity has also shown that the degree of right-side lateralization of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus is positively associated with visual processing speed in healthy young subjects (Chechlacz et al.,  ). In sum, in young healthy adults who process visual information faster, these frontoinsular and parietal networks that are important for tonic and phasic alertness, respectively, appear to be functionally well coupled. \n\nAccording to TVA, visual processing speed represents the number of visual elements that can be categorized in a given unit of time (e.g., 1 s; Bundesen,  ). This rate of encoding into VSTM depends on the strength of the sensory evidence, a perceptual decision bias, and the relative attentional weight of a specific object. In the neural interpretation of TVA, NTVA (Bundesen et al.,  ), the encoding speed is suggested to depend on both the number of cortical neurons representing the categorization and the firing rates of those neurons. More specifically, a perceptual decision bias determines how an object is categorized by changing the firing rate of the cortical neurons that code a particular feature (i.e., \u201cpigeonholing\u201d). The individual overall visual processing speed, parameter   C  , has been related, both theoretically and empirically, to alertness functions. For example, stimulant medication with methylphenidate and modafinil (Finke et al.,  ) as well as experimental manipulations enhancing phasic alertness (Matthias et al.,  ) have been shown to lead to an increase in this attentional capacity parameter. Recently, the effects of phasic alertness and temporal expectancy of upcoming stimuli were more formally integrated into the theory. More specifically, an enhancement of overall visual processing speed   C   was suggested, which would be given by a multiplicative upscaling of the activation, i.e., of the firing rates of all neurons coding the presented stimulus array by changes in perceptual bias (Vangkilde et al.,  ; Wiegand et al.,  ). Bias values have been proposed to derive from higher order areas (e.g., in frontal cortex) and, directly or indirectly, from the limbic system (Bundesen et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### VSTM storage capacity   K  \n  \nOne reason for our non-significant findings regarding this parameter might be the low variability of the   K   estimates and, thus, the lack of statistical power at the present sample size. Another reason might be the reliance of VSTM capacity on spatially organized sustained activity implemented via recurrent thalamocortical feedback loops (Bundesen et al.,  ), as supported by studies on the connectivity of thalamocortical fibers (Menegaux et al.,  ). Thus, future studies could examine inter-network thalamocortical FC in samples with greater variance in this parameter (e.g., in aging). \n\n\n\n### Visual attention weighting parameters \n  \n#### Top-down control \u03b1 and dorsal attention and visual networks \n  \nFrom a mechanistic perspective, the neural TVA suggests that top-down control is a selection bias, whereby higher \u201cattentional weights\u201d are assigned to objects that belong to a currently relevant category (e.g., red letters) (Bundesen et al.,  ). In the present study, we found that more efficient top-down control was linked with higher FC within the dorsal attention network, particularly in the precuneus. This result is in agreement with task-based neuroimaging studies (e.g., Wojciulik and Kanwisher,  ; Hopfinger et al.,  ; Weissman et al.,  ; Giesbrecht et al.,  ; Vossel et al.,  ), which have also revealed a general role of dorsal parietal regions in the control of selective attention. Importantly, however, our results add to the existing evidence for a role of the precuneus in attentional top-down controlled, task-based selection that is   independent   of individual capabilities in spatial attentional selection or processing speed. \n\nWe found that more, versus less, efficient top-down control was associated with lower FC within the visual network, particularly in the calcarine sulcus. Importantly, lower FC within the visual network was significantly associated with higher inter-network FC of the visual network with the executive control network. Moreover, more efficient control was related to higher FC between the visual and the executive control networks, though this result did not survive Bonferroni correction. Thus, it appears that it is the degree of functional coupling of the visual network with the executive control network that might be relevant for the individual degree of efficiency of top-down control. This finding accords with the assumption of a critical role of the executive control network in the adaptive control of goal-directed selection (Dosenbach et al.,  ,  ). Collectively, ours and previous findings suggest, in agreement with theoretical accounts of visual attention (Posner and Petersen,  ; Desimone and Duncan,  ; Bundesen et al.,  ), that the efficiency of top-down control is related to the degree of interaction between the executive control network generating attentional control signals and sensory structures that process visual information. \n\nOf note, although we failed to find significant inter-network FC between the visual and the dorsal attention networks, our results do not imply a lack of functional interaction between the two. In fact, there are consistent reports of directed FC from the dorsal attention network regions to the visual network regions during tasks involving visuospatial attention (e.g., Corbetta and Shulman,  ; Bressler et al.,  ; Spadone et al.,  ). Rather, they only suggest that higher intra-network FC in the dorsal attention network is by itself important for more efficient top-down control. In other words, the role of the intra-network FC for top-down control would be additional to that of the inter-network FC between the visual and executive control networks. This interpretation is in line with proposals according to which multiple cortical and non-cortical sources may be involved in top-down control if they carry information about the behavioral task goals (Gilbert and Li,  ). On this view, our finding of significant inter-network FC of the visual network with the executive control network would not be surprising. In fact, the prefrontal cortex\u2014a central component of the executive control network\u2014has been shown to be a source of biasing signals in object-based attention (Baldauf and Desimone,  ). Thus, rather than directly implying a lack of interaction between the visual and dorsal attention networks\u2014or, put differently, an exclusivity of the executive control network for top-down control over the visual network\u2014our results point to the relevance of all three networks. \n\n\n#### Spatial laterality   w  \n  \nThe lack of significant (Bonferroni corrected) group differences in any network for this parameter is not surprising in this sample of healthy young participants, given that no significant deviation from 0.5 in their   w   values was present. In neurologically impaired samples, by contrast, parameter   w   does exhibit high variance, such as in patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease, in which significant spatial biases have been revealed (Redel et al.,  ; Sorg et al.,  ). Accordingly, studies on groups with more evident lateralized attentional performance might well reveal a relationship of parameter   w   with FC. \n\n\n\n### Visual attention functions in the \u201cresting brain\u201d \n  \nIn mice, infra-slowly spontaneous neuronal fluctuations (i.e., 0.01\u20130.1 Hz) have been shown to underlie the intrinsic FC obtained from BOLD fMRI (Matsui et al.,  ). In humans, spontaneous slow cortical potentials (<0.5 Hz) measured with intracranial EEG have also been shown to be associated with intrinsic FC, where both have been proposed to reflect fluctuations of cortical excitability (He et al.,  ; Raichle,  ). These fluctuations indicate spontaneous subthreshold depolarizations of the cortical neuronal membranes, which influences the level of activation of cortical neurons (Wu et al.,  ). If spontaneous fluctuations of cortical excitability do indeed influence attention continuously, their spatial patterns of coherence among brain regions and networks could be captured by intrinsic FC. In consequence, the differential spatial patterns obtained by FC could, then, distinguish among separable attention traits. \n\nIn support of such links, previous findings have suggested that particular functional interactions within (Markett et al.,  ; Rosenberg et al.,  ) and between (Kelly et al.,  ) spontaneously active functional networks relate to variability of performance in attention tasks. Here, we document that the differences among healthy individuals in attentional parameters that are assumed to reflect relatively stable capabilities or latent traits (e.g., Finke et al.,  ) correspond to the intra- and inter-network FC of particular functional networks. \n\n\n### Functional implications and further issues \n  \nHealthy individuals differ in their ability to attend efficiently, and the TVA-based measurement provides for a systematic assessment of parameters expressing this variability (Habekost et al.,  ). While it is assumed that the different parameters reflect relatively stable capabilities of a given participant under stable environmental conditions (e.g., Finke et al.,  ), these capabilities might also change under particular circumstances. For example, the TVA parameters (Finke et al.,  ; Vangkilde et al.,  ) are influenced by certain pharmacological substances. Also, visual processing speed is enhanced by appropriate computerized training regimens (Schubert et al.,  ), whereas special populations such as patients with dyslexia (Stenneken et al.,  ), depression (G\u00f6gler et al.,  ), and schizophrenia (G\u00f6gler et al.,  ), exhibit reductions in visual processing speed. Furthermore, changes in attentional variability also occur during normal and pathological aging: healthy aging involves a slowing of visual processing (McAvinue et al.,  ; Habekost et al.,  ; Espeseth et al.,  ), and patients with mild cognitive impairment and the beginning of Alzheimer's disease reveal a staged decline of both visual processing speed (Bublak et al.,  ; Ruiz-Rizzo et al.,  ) and top-down control (Redel et al.,  ). \n\nOf theoretical importance, documenting specific relationships between changes in attentional functioning and intrinsic FC can stimulate hypothesis-driven analyses as to the brain mechanisms that underlie the changes. For instance, in studies employing neurocognitive enhancement procedures, it could be tested whether FC in specific networks might serve as a treatment target or a predictor of treatment success. Further, as regards disorders characterized by attentional dysfunction, focusing on changes in the FC of specific networks might help to better understand the cause of different attentional syndromes and improve diagnosis and treatment. As for patient populations, the advantage of our approach derives from its ready applicability: as information on multiple visual attention traits and functional networks can be obtained with two simple psychophysical tasks and one short, easy fMRI session, it can be used in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. This renders the approach particularly attractive for studies of aging populations to examine more directly whether the increasing severity of attentional dysfunctions is related to FC changes within and between particular networks. \n\nOur results highlight the relevance of particular functional networks for both visual attention capacity and weighting parameters. As a voxel-wise approach was used to identify the functional networks, differences were observed in specific regions within those networks. Note though that we do not consider those regions as being \u201cresponsible for\u201d visual processing speed or top-down control, as the values associated with the voxels comprising those regions reflect their connectivity with a particular network (Beckmann et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ), rather than their activity. Accordingly, we see them simply as clusters whose voxels reached statistical significance in this particular sample; at best, they allowed us to identify the relevant networks for visual attention functions. Furthermore, given that we relied on the group median to divide our sample of healthy young adults, we cannot make strong claims about \u201cincreased\u201d or, respectively, \u201cdecreased\u201d FC in our sample. We propose it would be more useful to examine whether the directionality of FC holds practical significance in terms of, for example, predicting the level of BOLD activity or connectivity during the actual performance of the whole- and partial-report tasks. Previous task-related fMRI studies have shown that individual differences in visual attention functions might not be reflected that much in differences in BOLD-evoked amplitudes (e.g., Gillebert et al.,  ), but rather in differential connectivity between regions (e.g., Vossel et al.,  ). Given the previous evidence, it might be interesting to examine, in future studies, the associations between \u201coffline\u201d (i.e., during rest) and \u201conline\u201d (i.e., during task) measures of FC with separate visual attention functions in order to establish the practical relevance of the directionality of FC. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nIn interpreting our results, several limitations must be taken into account. First, although oculomotor activity was not monitored during the tasks, systematic eye movements are unlikely because of the brief exposure durations in both the whole- and partial-report tasks. Second, previous work has shown that frame-to-frame motion can impact resting-state FC (e.g., Power et al.,  ). Although we relied on the power of ICA to remove the noise from the signal corresponding to functional networks (Beckmann and Smith,  ; Zuo et al.,  ), a low-scale noise influence on FC measures remains possible. Thus, future studies ought to consider applying more stringent methods of head motion control such as scrubbing regressors even in samples of healthy young adults. \n\nFinally, although we checked that our participants had not fallen asleep during the resting-state fMRI sequence, we cannot entirely exclude that some of them had, without being aware of it. However, possible micro-sleep is unlikely to have compromised our intrinsic FC measures for two reasons. First, previous research has shown that FC of both higher-order and primary sensory networks can be maintained during the transition from wakefulness to sleep (e.g., Larson-Prior et al.,  ). And second, while spatial changes within functional networks (i.e., decoupling of the default mode network) have been reported during deep sleep (e.g., Horovitz et al.,  ), it is improbable that our participants had reached deep sleep within the ~11 min duration of the resting-state fMRI sequence, as they were not sleep-deprived and reaching deep sleep in an unknown and noisy environment is difficult. \n\n\n### Summary and conclusion \n  \nIn sum, our study shows that visual attention functions correspond distinctively to the functional connectivity both within and between particular functional networks. Within networks, (i) higher visual processing speed was associated with lower functional connectivity within the ventral attention network; and (ii) more efficient top-down control was associated with higher functional connectivity within the dorsal attention network and lower functional connectivity within the visual network. Between networks, higher functional connectivity was observed between (i) the visual attention and right frontoparietal networks for higher visual processing speed; and (ii) the visual and executive control networks for more efficient top-down control. Finally, lower functional connectivity within a network might be explained by the higher functional connectivity between networks. To conclude, our results point to a distinctive network-based functional representation of separable visual attention functions, laying the basis for testing specific hypotheses about the neural mechanisms underlying these functions in aging or pathology. \n\n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nAR-R, KF, and CS designed the study; JN acquired the data; AR-R analyzed the data; AR-R, KF, and CS drafted the manuscript.

The amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) have been implicated in moral dysfunction in psychopathy in adolescents and adults, but no studies have been performed in populations in the transitional period to adulthood. We tested in multi-problem young adults the hypothesis that psychopathic traits are related to amygdala and vmPFC activity during moral evaluation. Additionally, we explored the relation between psychopathic traits and other regions consistently implicated in moral evaluation. Our final sample consisted of 100 multi-problem young adults and 22 healthy controls. During fMRI scanning, participants judged whether pictures showed a moral violation on a 1\u20134 scale. Whole brain analysis revealed neural correlates of moral evaluation consistent with the literature. Region of interest analyses revealed positive associations between the affective callous-unemotional dimension of psychopathy and activation in the left vmPFC, left superior temporal gyrus, and left cingulate. Our results are consistent with altered vmPFC function during moral evaluation in psychopathy, but we did not find evidence for amygdala involvement. Our findings indicate the affective callous-unemotional trait of psychopathy may be related to widespread altered activation patterns during moral evaluation in multi-problem young adults. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPsychopathy is a psychological construct characterized by affective callous-unemotional traits, impulsive and irresponsible behavior, and grandiose-manipulative interpersonal traits ( ). Individuals with high psychopathic traits engage in morally inappropriate behavior (e.g., committing crimes, lying, and cheating) and show a lack of guilt or remorse after performing antisocial actions ( ). However, research suggests they are generally capable of differentiating right from wrong when evaluating moral dilemmas or situations ( ,  ) and their moral reasoning can thus prove normal when assessed behaviorally. In the last decade, there has been an increasing interest in the underlying neurobiology of moral reasoning. Clarifying which neural processes are aberrant in persons with psychopathic traits may help understand why individuals with high psychopathic traits engage in their immoral behaviors. \n\nPrevious studies have investigated the relationship between psychopathic traits and moral processing in (forensic) adolescents and adults, but as of yet no research has specifically focused on a young adult group (aged 18\u201327). Given that the transition from adolescence to adulthood ( ) is especially challenging for vulnerable populations ( ) young adulthood is an important period to study distinctly ( ). In the present study, we investigated a sample of young adults (18\u201327 years old) who dysfunction in society and suffer from multiple problems. These multi-problem young adults lack a stable income, do not have the prerequisites to get a job, most of them have engaged in criminal activities of ranging seriousness (e.g., from shoplifting to violent crimes), and two thirds of them have had Child Protection Service (CPS) interference, chiefly due to judicial problems before age 18 ( ). It is an ecologically valid sample in which antisocial behavior is displayed in varying degrees. Therefore, we expect their psychopathic traits to vary accordingly from very low to very high. We measured psychopathy continuously, which is preferable over a taxonomic approach ( \u2013 ) as it allows for the entire range of the construct to be taken into account. \n\nBrain areas that have been implicated in the processing of moral information in healthy populations include the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which are important for processing emotional information; the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which is engaged in utilitarian decision making; and the superior temporal gyrus (STG), which is important when thinking about others ( ,  \u2013 ). A recent meta-analysis of fMRI research of moral processing ( ) distinguished between studies investigating moral judgments about situations (moral evaluations) and studies requiring participants to make moral decisions as if they were the actor (moral response decisions), as evidence suggests these are at least partially different processes ( ). The current study focuses on moral evaluations. Six brain areas were found to be specifically involved in making moral evaluations ( ): the right and left STG, the left cingulate gyrus (CG), the right medial frontal gyrus (MFG; part of the vmPFC) and two distinct areas in the left MFG (one in BA9, one in BA10). \n\nIt has been argued that amygdala and vmPFC dysfunction lie at the basis of the moral impairments of individuals high in psychopathic traits ( ). The amygdala is suggested to aversively reinforce actions that harm others; the vmPFC in turn processes this information and creates an outcome expectancy. When amygdala functioning is disrupted, the vmPFC fails to appropriately represent the valenced information, leading to immoral behavior. To date, decreased amygdala activity during moral processing (immoral minus nonmoral contrasts, where nonmoral stimuli are negative but not immoral) has been found in community volunteers with psychopathic traits ( ), but not in incarcerated males ( ), incarcerated adolescents ( ), or incarcerated women ( ). However, in the adolescent and female samples negative correlations between psychopathic traits and amygdaloid brain activity have been observed when contrasting both immoral and nonmoral stimuli with neutral stimuli (which are neither negative nor immoral). Negative correlations between vmPFC activity and psychopathic traits during moral processing have been reported in some studies ( ,  ), but not others ( ,  ). In short, although a theoretical basis for amygdala and vmPFC dysfunction underlying moral dysfunction in psychopathy exists ( ), neuroimaging results vary depending on samples and different ranges and variation of psychopathic traits within these samples. \n\nAs mentioned, in the current study we investigated a sample of multi-problem young adults (18\u201327 years old) with varying levels of psychopathic traits. At the time of assessment, all participants were enrolled in a day treatment program intended to help reintegrate into society. Within this heterogeneous sample, we employed a task that requires participants to make moral evaluations about situations that are presented as pictures. We included a group of healthy controls primarily to assess whether the task worked appropriately and whether multi-problem young adults are capable of performing the task. We expected to find brain activity related to moral evaluation in line with the current literature (i.e., increased vmPFC, STG, and CG activity), and tested the hypothesis that the three psychopathic dimensions are negatively related to amygdala and vmPFC activity during moral evaluation in multi-problem young adults. We also tested whether psychopathic traits are associated with other regions consistently implicated in moral processing (i.e., STG and CG). We expected the affective callous-unemotional dimension of psychopathy to be specifically relevant as it is representative of behavior related to moral evaluation (i.e., shallow affect, lack of empathy, lack of remorse). We investigated the impulsive-irresponsible and grandiose-manipulative dimension exploratively. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were 110 male multi-problem young adults [part of a larger study including 696 multi-problem young adults; ( )]. They were recruited at the start of day treatment program   De Nieuwe Kans   (DNK; translated as \u201cNew Opportunities\u201d). DNK provides a multimodal day treatment program, which aims to increase the self-sufficiency and decrease recidivism of multi-problem young adults. Additionally, 25 age and gender group matched healthy controls were included in the study. Controls were selected to have average education. Exclusion criteria for the fMRI study were non-corrected defective vision and fMRI contra-indications. Ten multi-problem young adults were excluded due to excessive movement (  N   = 3) or poor task performance (e.g., more than 5 missed trials;   N   = 7). Three controls were excluded due to poor task performance. The final sample included 100 multi-problem young adults and 22 healthy controls. See Table   for an overview of the descriptive data. \n  \nParticipant characteristics. \n  \nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Medical Ethical Committee of the VU University Medical Center. The protocol was approved by the VU University Medical Center Medical Ethical Committee (registration number 2013.422 - NL46906.029.13). All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants received a reimbursement of 30 euros for their participation in the fMRI protocol and an EEG protocol, which was administered on another day. \n\n\n### Instruments \n  \nPsychopathic traits were assessed using the Youth Psychopathy Inventory \u2013 Short Version [( ); also validated in young adults; ( )]. The YPI-SV is a self-report measure that distinguishes three factors of psychopathy: an affective callous-unemotional factor, a behavioral impulsive-irresponsible factor, and an interpersonal grandiose-manipulative factor. We used the Measurements in the Addictions for Triage and Evaluation Questionnaire (MATE) to assess current and historic drug use. In order to measure intelligence, we used the short form of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale third version (WAIS-III SF) consisting of four subtests ( ): digit symbol coding, information, block design, and arithmetic. The WAIS-III-SF was only assessed in the multi-problem group. See Table   for descriptive data. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nThree types of stimuli were used in the experiment: 25 immoral and negative (e.g., a person threatening another person with a knife); 25 non-moral and negative (e.g., people shouting at each other); and 25 neutral (e.g., people sitting next to each other). In order to select the stimuli, we first presented a set of 120 stimuli selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS;  ) (40 of each type as assessed by JZ) to a pilot group of 134 participants via the online tool Mechanical Turk ( ) and asked the participants to rate them on a 1-7 scale on their morality, valence, arousal, and complexity. From each category, 25 pictures were chosen in such a way that the immoral and nonmoral pictures matched on valence, arousal, and complexity, but not on morality. In other words, the moral and non-moral stimuli are specifically distinguishable on morality, which allows us to disentangle moral transgression from negative valence. For an overview of the average ratings of the stimuli see Table  . \n  \nAverage ratings of stimuli via Mechanical Turk (  N   = 134). \n  \n\n### Procedure and task \n  \nParticipants were told they would be shown pictures that might contain moral violations and were instructed to judge whether this was the case or not on a scale from 1 to 4, where 1 indicated that no moral violation was presented in the picture and 4 indicated that a major moral violation was presented in the picture. Participants were asked to consider the morality of the event depicted whilst viewing the picture and to press on the appropriate button after the picture was replaced by a rating scale. Participants were told that there were no right or wrong answers and that we were interested in their personal opinion. \n\nEach trial consisted of a picture being shown for 5 s, a rating scale of 1\u20134 being shown for 3 s, and a variable inter stimulus interval of 3\u20138 s (average 5.5 s), introducing jitter into the experimental design. Pictures were presented pseudo randomly, with a maximum of three pictures of the same condition being shown sequentially. Participants performed three practice trials in order to ensure they understood the experiment. The experiment was administered in two sessions (the first with 38 stimuli, the second with 37 stimuli) with a small break in between so that the task would not be too demanding. The task is based on and similar to that used by Harenski et al. ( ). We adopted a different response procedure, requiring participants to press one of four buttons whenever they had decided on their answer, rather than pressing one button when the answer they wanted to give was shown on the screen. Also, we introduced jitter by varying the intertrial intervals around a mean value, rather than using three distinct intertrial intervals. The experiment was created and presented with Presentation 17.1 ( ). \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition and analysis \n  \nMRI data were collected on a 3T GE Healthcare MRI scanner at Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam. Structural T1-weighted images were acquired with a fast-spoiled gradient pulse sequence in 180 sequential sagittal slices, with a thickness of 1.0 mm. The repetition time (TR) was 6.4 ms, the echo time (TE) 2.8 ms, the flip angle (FA) 12\u00b0, the field of view (FOV) 240 mm, and the matrix size 240 \u00d7 240 mm. Blood oxygen level-dependent T2 -weighted images were acquired axially with an echo planar imaging gradient echo pulse sequence in 42 slices of 3.5 mm with a slice spacing of 0.5 mm. The TR was 2,000 ms, the TE 30 ms, the FA 80\u00b0, the FOV 220 mm, and the matrix size 64 \u00d7 64 mm. \n\nFunctional imaging data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12;  ). As preprocessing steps, for each participant functional images were realigned and unwarped, the structural scan was segmented and co-registered to the mean T2 -weighted image. Images were then normalized to the MNI template and smoothed with an 8mm full-width half maximum Gaussian filter. The three conditions were modeled as 5-s events with the standard hemodynamic response function. Six movement parameters were added as covariates of no interest. Our contrast of interest was the immoral > nonmoral contrast, which is expected to be representative of brain activity due to the moral salience of the stimuli, controlled for the (negative) emotional valence of the stimuli. \n\nWe defined a priori regions of interest (ROI) based on the most recent meta-analysis concerning the neural correlates of moral decision-making ( ). We limited the ROIs to areas that were found to be consistently active during moral evaluation tasks. The a priori ROIs are the right and left superior temporal gyrus (STG;), the left cingulate gyrus (CG), the right vmPFC, and two distinct areas in the left vmPFC (one in BA9, one in BA10). Additionally, we included the right and left amygdala as ROIs since the amygdala has been implicated both theoretically ( ) and empirically ( ,  ) to be involved in moral processing and psychopathy. ROIs were created by forming 8mm-radius spheres around the peak coordinates (r-STG 53 12-28; l-STG-45-57 16; l-CG-3-59 26; r-vmPFC 3 59 4; l-vmPFC (BA9)-6 47 23; l-vmPFC (BA10)-4 54-5; l-amygdala-22-6-16; r-amygdala 24-4-14) that are reported in the literature ( ,  ). For the creation of the ROIs and the extraction of the ROI data we used the Marsbar toolbox for SPM ( ). \n\nFor the behavioral and questionnaire data, in order to compare the ratings of the three picture types between each other and between the multi-problem group and the control group, we performed a repeated measures ANOVA with group as between subjects factor and   post-hoc t  -tests. To investigate the relationship with IQ in the multi-problem group we performed Pearson's correlations between psychopathy, IQ, and behavioral responses. All thresholds were set to \u03b1 = 0.05 and   post-hoc   tests were Bonferroni corrected. \n\nFor the neuroimaging data, we performed whole-brain analysis in SPM12. The conditions were modeled in the context of the general linear model, using the canonical hemodynamic response function. Standard family-wise error correction (  p   < 0.05) was applied. For the association between psychopathy and ROI-activity during moral evaluation in the multi-problem group, we performed multiple linear regression analyses using the total psychopathy score or psychopathy subscale scores as independent variables and the extracted ROI data as dependent variables. We performed the analyses with and without IQ and drug use as covariates. Cannabis was the only drug prevalent enough in our sample to take into account (see Table  ), we controlled for both recent cannabis use (past 30 days) and historic cannabis use (amount of years that the drug was used at least once per week). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nWe compared the ratings of the three picture types between each other and between groups. A repeated measures ANOVA with picture type as within subjects factor and group as between subjects factor showed that the three types of pictures were rated differently in terms of moral violations across all participants [  F   = 530.52,   p   < 0.001]. Immoral pictures (  M   = 3.25,   SD   = 0.42) were rated as greater moral violations than nonmoral pictures [  M   = 2.11,   SD   = 0.65;   t   = 18.02,   p   < 0.001] and neutral pictures [  M   = 1.1,   SD   = 0.19;   t   = 52.34,   p   < 0.001]. Nonmoral pictures were rated as greater violations than neutral pictures [  M   = 1.11,   SD   = 0.19;   t   = 18.14,   p   < 0.001]. There was no main effect of group (  p   > 0.05), but we found a significant interaction between picture type and group [  F   = 6.84,   p   < 0.001]. \n\nMulti-problem young adults judged immoral pictures to represent smaller violations (  M   = 3.21,   SD   = 0.41) than controls did [  M   = 3.41,   SD   = 0.40;   t   = \u22122.10,   p   < 0.05]. In contrast, multi-problem young adults judged nonmoral pictures to represent larger violations (  M   = 2.17,   SD   = 0.65) than controls did [  M   = 1.86,   SD   = 0.64;   t   = 2.00,   p   < 0.05]. However, after Bonferroni correction, these tests failed to reach significance. Both groups rated the neutral pictures similarly (  p   > 0.05). See Table   for an overview. \n\nWithin the multi-problem group, none of the ratings of picture types were significantly related to total psychopathy score and psychopathic traits (all   p  s > 0.05). We found a negative correlation between IQ and rating of the nonmoral stimuli (  r   = \u22120.41,   p   < 0.001) thus multi-problem young adults with lower IQs judged nonmoral stimuli to show larger moral violations. IQ was not significantly related to the ratings of immoral (  r   = 0.08,   p   = 0.41) and neutral stimuli (  r   = \u22120.17,   p   = 0.11). Finally, IQ was not significantly related to any psychopathic traits (all   p  s > 0.05). \n\n\n### Imaging results \n  \nFirst, we performed a whole brain analysis of the contrast of interest moral > nonmoral across all participants. This revealed significant increased hemodynamic responses in the STG, in several distinct areas of the vmPFC, in the precuneus, the parahippocampal gyrus, in the middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and in the cerebellum (see Figure  ). Also, we found increased activation in the precentral gyrus and the thalamus, this is likely due to the setup of the task: when participants evaluated pictures as not representative of a moral violation or as representative of a slight moral violation they used their left hand, when participants evaluated pictures as representative of a somewhat immoral violation or a strong moral violation participants used their right hand (see Table   for an overview). No significant differences in activation patterns in any of the brain regions were found between the experimental group and the control group in the analyses of this contrast. \n  \nWhole brain analysis of the immoral > nonmoral contrast (x = 6, y = 56, z = 19). \n    \nfMRI whole brain analysis (immoral > nonmoral),   N   = 122. \n  \nSecond, we extracted the summary time courses for the a priori defined ROIs and performed linear regression analyses to examine the relationship between the level of psychopathy and brain activity of the immoral > nonmoral contrast in the multi-problem group. We found the total psychopathy score to be positively related to brain activation in the left vmPFC (BA10) (\u03b2 = 0.22,   p   < 0.05) and the left STG (\u03b2 = 0.23,   p   < 0.05). We found no significant relation in the other regions of interest. We performed hierarchical regression analyses adding one subscale of the YPI at each level in order to assess their individual contributions to the models. We found the affective callous-unemotional factor score of psychopathy to be positively related to brain activation in the left vmPFC (BA10) (\u03b2 = 0.23,   p   < 0.05), left STG (\u03b2 = 0.27,   p   < 0.01), and CG (\u03b2 = 0.21,   p   < 0.05), see Figure  . The behavioral and interpersonal factors did not predict brain activity in any of the ROIs. See Table   for an overview. \n  \nSignificant associations between the callous-unemotional affective trait of psychopathy and brain activity in a priori ROIs. \n    \nRegression analyses on extracted a priori ROI summary time courses,   N   = 100. \n  \n The behavioral and interpersonal traits of psychopathy were not significantly related to brain activity in the a priori ROIs  . \n  \nThird, we added IQ and drug use as covariates in the models. This did not change any of the reported results, but IQ itself was positively related to brain activity in the left vmPFC (BA10; \u03b2 = 0.18,   p   < 0.05), left STG (\u03b2 = 0.20,   p   < 0.05), and left CG (\u03b2 = 0.20,   p   < 0.05). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we investigated the relationship between psychopathic traits and the neural correlates of moral evaluation in a sample of male multi-problem young adults. Multi-problem young adults were able to discriminate between immoral and nonmoral stimuli, but less well so than the control group, as they gave nonmoral pictures higher moral ratings and immoral pictures lower ratings. In line with previous research, several specific brain regions showed increased activity during moral evaluation, most notably the vmPFC, STG, parahippocampal gyrus, and precuneus. We did not find any negative relationships between the brain activity in these regions and psychopathic traits in the amygdala and vmPFC. Rather, we found no effect in the amygdala and found positive associations in the left vmPFC, left STG, and left CG, indicating that multi-problem young adults high in psychopathic traits show a greater increase in brain activity in these areas during moral evaluation than multi-problem young adults low in psychopathic traits. \n\nMulti-problem young adults discriminated less between immoral and nonmoral stimuli than the control group. This difference does not seem to be driven by psychopathic traits, as both groups have similar psychopathic trait scores, and we found no relation between psychopathic traits and participants' responses to the stimuli. Potentially, this finding might be due to a difference in intelligence between groups. Although we did not formally assess the IQ of the control group, we can assume they have a higher level of intelligence than the multi-problem young adults given the low average IQ (mean IQ 83) and lower educational level of the multi-problem young adults. Furthermore, within the multi-problem group there was a moderately strong and negative correlation (  r   = \u22120.41) between IQ and the rating of the nonmoral pictures. It could be the case that individuals with lower IQs are less capable of separating negative situations from immoral situations or that they tend to overinterpret the information shown to them (e.g., if people are shouting, someone must have done something wrong). \n\nThe lack of amygdala activity across both groups for the immoral > nonmoral contrast as well as the lack of relation between amygdala activity and psychopathy scores may indicate that amygdala dysfunction in psychopathy might not be specifically relevant to moral evaluations, nor to moral evaluation in general. There is strong evidence for amygdala dysfunction in emotion processing in psychopathy [e.g., ( \u2013 )], but the evidence for a relation with moral processing is less clear. For example, negative relations between amygdala activity and psychopathy have mostly been found in immoral + nonmoral > neutral, immoral > neutral, and nonmoral > neutral contrasts, but not in immoral > nonmoral contrasts ( ,  ). This would also explain why ( ) did find an effect in the amygdala as in their analysis they specifically contrasted \u201cmoral personal emotion-provoking\u201d and \u201cmoral impersonal less emotional\u201d dilemmas. Additionally, a recent and specific meta-analysis on moral processing found no evidence for amygdala involvement ( ) in contrast to an older meta-analysis ( ). \n\nIn the vmPFC, we observed a positive relationship between psychopathic traits and brain activity during moral evaluation, indicating that young adults high in psychopathic traits show a greater increase in vmPFC activity during moral evaluation than young adults low in psychopathic traits. One possible explanation is that individuals high in psychopathic traits have to recruit this region to a greater extent in order to reach a normal level of moral evaluation. In fact, studies have shown increased prefrontal brain activity in criminal psychopaths during emotion processing ( ), increased dorsolateral prefrontal brain activity in community volunteers with high psychopathic traits during moral processing ( ), and the affective trait of psychopathy has been found to be positively related to frontal brain activity when viewing fearful faces ( ). Likewise, in a study in healthy participants, participants with lower moral judgment competence showed increased vmPFC activity during a moral evaluation task compared to participants with higher moral judgment competence scores. In this study, participants performing worse showed increased rather than decreased brain activity ( ). That such a mechanism of overcompensation is present in our sample and not in most studies on psychopathic traits and moral evaluation may be due to the specific age range of our sample or its low IQ. Whereas in other studies participants usually have average to high IQs, the average IQ within our sample is low and the variation is limited, it may be the case that a combination of high psychopathic traits and low IQ required multi-problem young adults to engage more brain activity in order to perform the task. Another explanation for the association is that as the vmPFC is a large brain area, distinct areas within the vmPFC may perform different functions when making moral evaluations. Therefore, generalizing activity from specific clusters across the vmPFC may not be prudent and future research disentangling distinct areas functioning within the vmPFC is needed to elucidate this. \n\nIn addition to the effects observed in the vmPFC, we found positive relations of similar strength between psychopathic traits and brain activity during moral evaluating in the left CG and the left STG. In accordance with our vmPFC finding, the callous-unemotional affective factor of psychopathy accounted for these observations. A previous studies also reported a negative correlation between moral CG activity and psychopathic traits ( ) but no correlations between moral STG activity and psychopathic traits. However, a negative correlation in the STG has been observed using an immoral + nonmoral > neutral contrast ( ). As we included the CG and STG as ROIs, our analysis is more sensitive to effects in these areas and other studies may have missed these. Our results suggest that most of the brain regions associated with moral evaluating behave aberrantly in psychopathy, rather than the vmPFC and possibly amygdala specifically. \n\nAs the effects we observed are all specific to the callous-unemotional affective trait of psychopathy, this is likely the main factor related to moral evaluation in our population. This does not seem surprising since moral evaluating requires empathy to assess a situation, whereas for example impulsivity and grandiosity may be more relevant when deciding what to do. It is possible that deficits in moral evaluation are driven by the callous-unemotional affective trait, whereas deficits in moral response decisions may also be driven by the impulsive and irresponsible behavioral, and grandiose-manipulative interpersonal traits. One study has shown psychopathic traits in a healthy sample to be related behaviorally to moral decisions, but not moral judgment ( ). It would be valuable for future research to delve into the neurobiological differences between moral evaluations and moral response decisions, and investigate whether distinct psychopathic traits are differentially related to these processes. \n\nA limiting factor in comparing our study to others is the fact that we used the YPI, which is a self-report questionnaire, to assess psychopathy rather than the more extensive PCL-R or PCL-YV ( ). The YPI has good convergent validity ( ) and the YPI and the PCL-YV correlate with moderate strength ( ), so it seems unlikely the positive relation between psychopathy and brain activity during moral evaluations is due to the use of a self-report measure. However, other research has suggested that psychopathy subscales specifically are not interchangeable between different assessment instruments ( ), so caution is warranted. Another limitation is that we did not use urine screens or breathalyzer to objectively assess whether participants adhered to the instruction to refrain from substance use prior to the MRI session, all participants reported adhering to the instructions. \n\nIn conclusion, we found brain activation related to moral evaluation in the STG, in several distinct areas of the vmPFC, in the precuneus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and in the cerebellum in a group of multi-problem young adults and healthy controls; we found that brain activity in the left vmPFC, left STG, and left CG was associated with the affective callous-unemotional traits of psychopathy; and we found that IQ, but not psychopathic traits are related to the moral evaluations of participants. Our results add to the evidence that brain dysfunction underlies psychopathic traits in moral evaluation and suggest that most of the brain regions associated with moral evaluating are affected in young adults with higher levels of psychopathy, specifically on the affective callous-unemotional dimension, rather than the vmPFC and possibly amygdala alone. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nJZ, RM, HT, and AP contributed to the study design;

Previous research has demonstrated that children with DCD and ADHD have altered brain region communication, particularly within the motor network. The structure and function of the motor network in a typically developing brain exhibits hemispheric dominance. It is plausible that functional deficits observed in children with DCD and ADHD are associated with neurodevelopmental alterations in within- and between-hemisphere motor network functional connection strength that disrupt this hemispheric dominance. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine functional connections of the left and right primary and sensory motor (SM1) cortices in children with DCD, ADHD and DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD, relative to typically developing children. Our findings revealed that children with DCD, ADHD and DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD exhibit atypical within- and between-hemisphere functional connection strength between SM1 and regions of the basal ganglia, as well as the cerebellum. Our findings further support the assertion that development of atypical motor network connections represents common and distinct neural mechanisms underlying DCD and ADHD. In children with DCD and DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD (but not ADHD), a significant correlation was observed between clinical assessment of motor function and the strength of functional connections between right SM1 and anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, and regions involved in visuospatial processing. This latter finding suggests that behavioral phenotypes associated with atypical motor network development differ between individuals with DCD and those with ADHD. \n   Highlights  \n  \nResting-state fMRI was used to examine motor networks of children with DCD and ADHD. \n  \nDCD and ADHD exhibited atypical within- and between-hemisphere motor network connections. \n  \nNeuromuscular development was associated with functional connection strength in DCD, but not ADHD. \n  \nResting-state fMRI can identify shared and distinct neural mechanisms that underlie ADHD and DCD. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDevelopmental coordination disorder (DCD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood, affecting 5\u20136% of school-aged children ( ,  ). It is characterized by impairments in motor coordination that significantly interferes with activities of daily living, and also impacts academic productivity, prevocational and vocational activities, as well as leisure and play ( ,  ). The clinical presentation of DCD is diverse ( ,  ,  ,  ), and up to 50% of children with DCD also meet diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ( ,  ). ADHD occurs in approximately 5% of children ( ,  ) and is associated with age-inappropriate levels of inattention, hyperactivity and/or impulsivity ( ). The etiology of the comorbidity of DCD and ADHD, however, is not well understood. \n\nChildren with DCD often exhibit functional deficits in cross-modal integration (i.e., integration of information from different sensory modalities), specifically during tasks that demand visual feedback for motor control ( ), internal/forward modeling (e.g., movement planning), gait and postural control, visual perception and motor coordination ( ,  ). Deficits in cross-modal integration have also been observed in children with ADHD ( ). Studies of typical individuals and split-brain patients indicate that cross-modal integration requires successful communication between a number of brain regions, both within and between hemispheres ( ,  ,  ), especially as tasks become more complex ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nNeuroimaging studies support the contention that brain region communication is disrupted in children with DCD and ADHD. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have implicated the corpus callosum ( ,  ,  ), a structure responsible for inter-hemispheric communication, as well as the right forceps minor and the anterior corona radiate ( ) in these disorders. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of children with DCD have demonstrated atypical activity within visuospatial regions during complex tracing tasks ( ,  ,  ). In children with ADHD, fMRI studies have noted reduced activity of the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during right-hand (i.e., left-hemisphere) response inhibition when performing a Go/No-Go task ( ,  ,  ). Thus, it is important that the motor network exhibit appropriate within- and between-hemisphere connections. \n\nIn the typically developing brain, the structure and function of motor regions actually differs between hemispheres. Structurally, right-handed individuals have a deeper left central sulcus than left-handed individuals ( ). The left motor cortex in right-handed individuals also has greater neuropil volume, reflecting the number of dendrites, axons and synapses ( ). A DTI study demonstrated that the left corticospinal tract in infants is more structurally developed than the right ( ). Functionally, an fMRI study of right-handed adults demonstrated that the left motor cortex exhibits greater activation with both ipsilateral and contralateral movements compared to the right motor cortex ( ). Whether these structural and functional differences are associated with disrupted within-hemisphere and/or between-hemisphere functional connections between cortical and subcortical regions of the motor network has not been established. Furthermore, this has not been explored in children with DCD and ADHD, and could represent an underlying mechanism for the functional deficits observed in these children. \n\nUsing resting-state fMRI, our recent study observed reduced functional connectivity (i.e., reduced temporal synchrony between distinct brain regions and an indicator of functional connection strength) between left motor cortex and structures of the basal ganglia, including the caudate, putamen and globus pallidus in children with DCD, ADHD, and DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD, compared to typically developing children ( ). It is plausible these disruptions of functional connectivity observed in our previous study could also be associated with alterations in how cortical and subcortical regions of the motor network are connected within and between hemispheres. Thus, in the present study, we reexamined the data from the right-handed individuals of our previous study in order to investigate the hypothesis that within- and between-hemisphere functional connections of the motor network are altered in children with DCD, ADHD, and DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD, when compared to typically developing children. Furthermore, we hypothesized that ADHD and DCD children would exhibit similar alterations in within- and between-hemisphere connections to support the comorbidity of these disorders, as well as alterations specific to DCD alone. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis study was conducted in accordance with the code of ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving human subjects. The institutional review board for the ethics of human research approved the study. Consent and verbal assent were obtained from parents and children, respectively, after study procedures were fully explained. \n\n### Participants and assessment \n  \nAs described in our previous study ( ), participants were recruited from local schools and through community advertisements in locations such as hospitals and physician's offices in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Children were classified as DCD if they met the following criteria, which are consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV-TR diagnostic criteria: they scored below the 16th percentile on The Movement Assessment Battery for Children \u2013 Second Edition (MABC-2;  ) (Criterion A), were reported by their parents as exhibiting motor difficulties that interfered significantly with daily functioning (as indicated on the Developmental Coordination Questionnaire ( )) (Criterion B), did not evidence a visual impairment or other neurological/medical (e.g., epilepsy, cerebral plays, muscular dystrophy) condition that would affect movement and did not meet criteria for a diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorder (Criterion C) and did not display an intellectual impairment as evidenced by performance on a standardized measure of cognitive function (Criterion D). Scores greater than the 5th percentile and less than the 16th percentile on the MABC-2 are associated with mild to moderate motor impairment, whereas scores less than the 5th percentile are associated with severe motor impairment. Children were classified as ADHD if they met diagnostic criteria on the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-IV ( ) or had a   t  -score above the 95th percentile on the Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised ( ) and were diagnosed by a physician as having ADHD based on DSM-IV criteria. Children meeting criteria for both DCD and ADHD were classified as DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD. Children not meeting the criteria for DCD, ADHD or DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD were assigned to the typically developing group. All children were required to be right handed. This assessment resulted in 19 ADHD alone children, 6 DCD alone children, 14 DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD children and 21 typically developing children. These group sizes are less than our previous study, as we selected only right-handed children for the present analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics of each group are summarized in  . \n\nExclusion criteria for all groups included a history of a diagnosed metabolic or genetic condition, epilepsy or other seizure disorder, cerebral palsy, psychiatric disorder other than ADHD, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, prematurity (born at <\u00a036\u00a0weeks gestation), very low birth weight (<\u00a01500\u00a0g), or severe traumatic brain injury. There were no group differences for age or IQ (see  ); however, the typically developing group had a significantly higher proportion of females compared to the other groups [\u03c7(1,   N  \u00a0=\u00a060)\u00a0=\u00a013.1,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05]. Children on stimulant treatment for ADHD were asked to refrain from taking medication on the day of imaging. All children in the ADHD group, and all but one in the DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD group were on stimulant medication. \n\nAs there is no gold standard for identifying DCD, in addition to the MABC-2, all participants were assessed using a second measure of motor skills, the McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND;  ). The MAND is a standardized measure of fine and gross motor skills in individuals from 3\u00a0years into adulthood. It includes 10 items. The raw scores on each item are converted to a scaled score with a mean of 10 and standard deviation (SD) of 3. A Neurodevelopmental Index score (NDI) with a mean of 100 (SD\u00a0=\u00a015) is derived from the sum of the scaled scores. The MAND has been found to have good test-retest reliability and to be a valid measure of motor function in children ( ,  ). NDI scores of each group are summarized in  . \n\n\n### Image acquisition and analysis \n  \nImages were collected using a 3 Tesla GE MR scanner (Signa VH/i, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) with an eight-channel phased-array radiofrequency (RF) head coil. Resting-state fMRI consisted of five minutes of a T *-weighted gradient-recalled echo, echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR/TE\u00a0=\u00a02000/30\u00a0ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a070\u00b0, matrix size 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064, FOV\u00a0=\u00a0220\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0220\u00a0mm, 4-mm slice thickness, 26 slices). Foam padding was fitted between the RF coil and the head at the temples and the forehead to restrict head movement. Participants were asked to look at a fixation cross at the center of a screen during imaging. T -weighted images were obtained for anatomical registration of the fMRI data (multi-slice fast spoiled gradient echo; TR/TE\u00a0=\u00a0200/2.5\u00a0ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a018\u00b0, matrix size\u00a0=\u00a0128\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0128, FOV\u00a0=\u00a0220\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0220\u00a0mm, 4-mm slice thickness, 40 slices). \n\nPrior to statistical analysis, resting-state fMRI data underwent pre-processing using with the FMRIB Software Library (FSL,  ), which included scalp and skull removal using the Brain Extraction Tool (BET) ( ), motion correction using MCFLIRT ( ), interleaved slice timing correction, temporal high pass filtering (>\u00a00.01\u00a0Hz), spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of 6\u00a0mm, and registration to the Montreal Neurological Institute standard template with resampling to 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0mm . T -weighted images were segmented into grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid using FMRIB's Automated Segmentation Tool (FAST) ( ). All participants' data were examined for head motion, and data were excluded from analysis if head movement exceeded 2\u00a0mm. In addition, given the potential for head motion in the ADHD/DCD groups, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine if there were any differences in the degree of head motion between groups. \n\nMasks of left and right SM1 were manually drawn on each participant's anatomical images using the FSLView drawing tool, with the omega-shaped anatomical landmark of the motor cortex as a guide ( ). Masks were registered to the participant's native resting-state fMRI data space using FLIRT, and then reduced to a final volume of 100 contiguous voxels using the process of inter-voxel temporal cross-correlation, which identifies the region within the mask with the greatest homogeneity in terms of temporal synchrony ( ). Prior to analysis of data using this mask, the center of gravity of the anatomical location of the mask and the degree of cross-correlation within masks were each tested between subject groups using a Student's   t  -test. This analysis revealed there were no differences between groups; thus, there were no group biases in this method of mask generation. \n\nThe average time series of the voxels in left SM1 was computed from the preprocessed resting-state data to act as the regressor of interest in a time-series analysis using the general linear model (GLM), as implemented in   FEAT v6.0   (FSL,  ). The average time series from white matter and CSF were used as nuisance regressors. The GLM analysis generated a map of the functional connectivity of left SM1 with the rest of the brain. This procedure was repeated using the average time series of the voxels in right SM1 to give a map of the functional connectivity of right SM1 with the rest of the brain. A mixed effects GLM analysis was then performed using all participants' left SM1 and right SM1 functional connectivity maps. Maps were created for each group to show: 1) the average connectivity of left SM1 and right SM1, as well as brain voxels that overlapped in these two maps, and 2) brain voxels that exhibited a significant difference in their connectivity with left SM1 and right SM1. These maps were computed as Z-statistic images and corrected for multiple comparisons based on a family-wise error rate to a significance level of   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.05, using   AlphaSim   of the AFNI analysis package ( ). Brain regions were anatomically identified by Brodmann's area and using the Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical structural atlases within   FSLView   ( ,  ). Because the proportion of males and females significantly differed between groups, we performed a preliminary image analysis, which revealed no group differences for sex. Thus, sex was not included as a factor in the main group analysis, which helped to maximize the available degrees of freedom. \n\n\n### Behavioural analysis \n  \nNDI scores were compared between groups by ANOVA. For groups exhibiting a significant difference from typically developing children, NDI scores were entered into a correlation analysis with functional connectivity (left SM1 and right SM1, separately) on a pixel-by-pixel basis, to identify brain regions whose strength of functional connections with SM1 significantly varied with NDI score. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nNo datasets needed to be discarded due to excessive head motion during imaging. ANOVA revealed no statistical difference between groups in terms of maximum head motion (in mm) during imaging [  F  (3,56)\u00a0=\u00a01.47,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.23], and thus all data sets were included in the analysis. \n\nGroup functional connectivity maps for left SM1 and right SM1, as well as overlapping voxels, are shown in  . Significant functional connections with SM1 were observed for all groups and were consistent with those reported previously, including the contralateral and ipsilateral primary motor, somatosensory and premotor cortices, as well as the putamen, thalamus and cerebellum ( ,  ). As expected, there was considerable overlap of the left and right SM1 connectivity maps (shown in green in  ) for all groups. Visual inspection suggests there were differences between the DCD, ADHD, DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD, and typically developing groups in the degree of this overlap. These differences were tested statistically on a voxel-by-voxel basis and corrected for multiple comparisons, as described above. \n\nBrain regions whose functional connectivity with left SM1 significantly differed from that with right SM1 are shown in   and are listed in   and  . For all groups, the left precentral and postcentral gryi and left posterior insula were more strongly connected with left SM1 than with right SM1, and the right precentral and postcentral gryi and right posterior insula were more strongly connected with right SM1 than with left SM1. In other words, the motor cortex of typically developing children possessed stronger within-hemisphere connections with other motor cortices and the posterior insula than between-hemisphere connections, and this was preserved in children with ADHD or DCD. \n\nIn typically developing children, the right thalamus and left lobule V of the cerebellum were more strongly connected with right SM1 than with left SM1. This was not the case for children with ADHD or DCD. For these children, the left thalamus and right lobule V of the cerebellum were more strongly connected with left SM1 than with right SM1. Thus, the right motor cortex of typically developing children had stronger within-hemisphere connections with the thalamus and contralateral connections with the cerebellum. For children with ADHD or DCD, it is the left motor cortex that possessed these stronger connections. \n\nOur results also demonstrated altered functional connections specific to children with DCD. The right putamen was more strongly connected with right SM1 than left SM1 in typically developing children and children with ADHD. For children with DCD, however, the right putamen did not possess stronger within-hemisphere connections with motor cortex; the right putamen in these children was equally connected to right and left SM1. A summary highlighting the group differences in within- and between-hemisphere functional connections with SM1 is provided in  . \n\nChildren with DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD exhibited additional alterations in motor network connectivity, including stronger connections of bilateral precuneus, middle frontal gyri and inferior lateral occipital cortices with the left SM1 than with the right SM1. These regions were equally connected to left and right SM1 in typically developing children and children with only ADHD or DCD, \n\nANOVA of NDI scores revealed a significant difference between groups [  F  (3,56)\u00a0=\u00a021.87,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001]. Follow-up Tukey HSD tests demonstrated that the typically developing group significantly differed from the DCD and DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD groups [HSD\u00a0>\u00a0HSD(0.01)\u00a0=\u00a019.34,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.01]; however, typically developing children did not differ significantly from children with ADHD [HSD\u00a0<\u00a0HSD(0.05)\u00a0=\u00a015.75,   p  \u00a0>\u00a00.05]. This is in agreement with a previous study ( ). Since the NDI scores for children with ADHD children were in the average range, it appears that the difference from typically developing children was predominantly due to DCD and not ADHD. Thus, the DCD and DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD groups were combined in order to investigate the correlation between NDI scores and each of left and right SM1 connectivity in all children with DCD.   shows the results of this analysis. Connectivity with right SM1 was significantly correlated with NDI score in regions of the default mode network, including a positive correlation with the medial prefrontal cortex and a negative correlation with the anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral angular gyri. No brain regions exhibited a significant correlation between NDI score and connectivity with left SM1. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWithin- and between-hemisphere functional connections amongst cortical motor areas, subcortical motor areas and the cerebellum (e.g., cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway connections) are necessary to integrate sensory information from both sides of the body when coordinating, planning and executing movements. Our findings demonstrate that the functional connections between these regions are altered in children with DCD and ADHD, lending support to our hypothesis that within- and between-hemisphere motor functional connections are altered in children with DCD and ADHD, and that some of these are neural mechanisms common to ADHD and DCD and some are mechanisms specific to DCD. \n\n### Preserved motor connections in ADHD and DCD \n  \nWe observed stronger within-hemisphere connections of the posterior insula and SM1 in typically developing children and in children with ADHD and DCD, compared to between-hemisphere connections. This not been reported previously; however, one resting-state fMRI study has established significant connections between the posterior insula and SM1 ( ), supporting a role of the posterior insula in sensorimotor integration. Given that DCD is a sensory processing disorder, altered functional connections between the posterior insula and SM1 is a plausible mechanism for sensory processing deficits in DCD; however, our data suggest there is no alteration in the within- and between-hemisphere functional connections of the posterior insula with SM1. \n\n\n### Altered motor connections common to ADHD and DCD \n  \nLobules V and VI of the cerebellum are key regions in the coordination, planning and execution of movements ( ). The thalamus fulfills a similar role, amongst others. Our typically developing children exhibited stronger functional connections between right SM1 and the right thalamus and left cerebellar lobule V, relative to their connections with left SM1. Stronger within-hemisphere connections between right SMI and right thalamus relative to between-hemisphere connections and stronger contralateral connections between right SM1 and the cerebellum have not been reported previously, and the reason for their existence is unclear. One possibility is that it is necessary to mitigate the non-dominance of the left hand for tasks that require dexterity and coordination; however, further studies to investigate the relationship between these functional connections and left hand function are required to substantiate this postulation. \n\nOur results show that children with DCD and ADHD (including DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD) exhibit a different pattern of within- and between-hemisphere connections of the thalamus and cerebellum, when compared to typically developing children: the left thalamus and the right lobule V of the cerebellum are more connected with left SM1 than with right SM1 in children with DCD and ADHD children (summarized in  ). Following the argument above regarding mitigation of the non-dominant hand in controls, it is plausible that stronger within-hemisphere connections of the left thalamus and stronger between-hemisphere connections of the right cerebellum may be an attempt to mitigate sensorimotor deficits of the dominant right hand in children with DCD and ADHD. Our findings also support a previous resting-state fMRI study of ADHD that demonstrated disruptions within frontal-striatal-cerebellar circuits ( ), as well other studies that observed alterations in cognitive and attention brain networks ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ); some of these studies suggest there is an interaction between these altered networks and changes within networks associated with motor and sensory functions ( ,  ). Our findings provide direct evidence of how the motor network is altered in DCD and ADHD, and serve to foster future studies of these interactions. \n\n\n### Altered motor connections in DCD, but preserved in ADHD \n  \nWe observed that the within-hemisphere connections between the right putamen and SM1 were stronger than the between-hemisphere connections, in typically developing children and in children with ADHD (both ADHD alone and in combination with DCD). These connections thus appear to be part of typical development and are not impacted in ADHD. As discussed above, it is possible that stronger connections in the right hemisphere between subcortical regions and the motor cortex may be associated with mitigation of the non-dominant hand. In DCD alone children, however, the between-hemisphere and within-hemisphere connections of the right putamen with SM1 were of equivalent strength (summarized in  ). This finding suggests that DCD children lack the hemispheric dominance of functional connections between the right putamen and the motor cortex, and hence constitutes a neural mechanism specific to DCD. The lack of hemispheric dominance of right putamen functional connections may help explain the bimanual coordination deficits observed in children with DCD. This alteration in functional connections could also be associated with the observation of reduced diffusivity within the corticospinal tract and posterior thalamic radiation in children with DCD relative to typically developing children ( ), which together may help explain the significant deficits observed across a wide range of motor functions, including implicit motor planning ( ). \n\n\n### Additional altered connections in DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD \n  \nIn our children with DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD, the precuneus, middle frontal gyri and inferior lateral occipital cortex all exhibited stronger functional connections with left SM1 than with right SM1. This could be the result of weakened functional connections of these areas to right SM1. These regions have vital roles in spatial orientation and other higher order visual and sensory functions. Thus, our findings suggest that alteration in functional connections associated with higher order sensory processing represent a mechanism underlying the comorbidity of ADHD and DCD. These altered connections could possibly explain the visuospatial problems that have been associated with these disorders, particularly DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD ( ,  ). \n\n\n### Correlations between right SM1 connectivity and NDI scores in DCD children \n  \nThese latter points are supported by our observation of a significant correlation between NDI scores and connectivity of the right SM1 with regions of the default mode network associated with visuospatial processing (i.e., the angular gyri), which has been implicated in DCD ( ,  ,  ,  ). A significant difference in NDI scores between DCD (either alone or in combination with ADHD) and typically developing children, but not ADHD alone children, is in agreement with previous studies ( ). We, however, have extended this previous finding by demonstrating an underlying physiological mechanism for neurodevelopment severity in DCD (and DCD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD) children in the form of altered functional connections of the motor network with visuospatial processing regions; this is highly clinically significant, and it also suggests that the behavioral phenotypes associated with atypical motor network development differ between individuals with DCD (alone or in combination with ADHD) and those with ADHD alone. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nAlthough we had 20 children with DCD in our sample, only six had DCD alone. Thus, sample size of the DCD alone group is a major limitation. However, the consistency between the findings in our DCD alone group with those of the other groups increases the confidence in our results. In addition, NDI only differed between typically developing children and DCD (either alone or in combination with ADHD) and not ADHD alone. This allowed us to perform our correlational analysis of NDI score and functional connection strength with our original DCD group size of 20. Nevertheless, our findings could be further substantiated by increasing the size of the DCD group, as well as by employing concurrent structural markers to examine the integrity of white matter tracts along motor pathways. Furthermore, comprehensive behavioral evaluation of the functional deficits experienced by these children could help elucidate the specific motor pathways altered by different clinical features of DCD and ADHD. Due to the cross-sectional design of the current study, we are unable to examine the impact of brain maturation on connectivity; however, future longitudinal studies could address this issue. \n\nThe children in the DCD group met only 3 of the 4 of the DSM-V criteria for the disorder. We did not specifically establish whether the motor coordination difficulties evidenced by the children in the DCD groups were present from an early age or of recent onset. However, children who evidenced history of traumatic brain injury or other neurological conditions, which could account for recent onset of the symptoms associated with DCD, were excluded from participation in this study. \n\nAll children with ADHD, but one, were on stimulant medication. Therefore, medication status could potentially explain some of the differences we observed between ADHD and DCD children. However, the consistency of our findings across all patient groups as well as the apparent specificity of NDI score to children with DCD (either alone or in combination with ADHD) strongly suggests that medication status had little or no effect on our findings. \n\nIn summary, our findings support the hypothesis that within- and between-hemisphere functional connections are altered in the motor networks of children with DCD and ADHD, some of which are associated with ADHD and DCD comorbidity, and others that are specific to DCD alone. Our results thus provide important clues as to the shared and distinct neural mechanisms that underlie these common neurodevelopmental disorders. \n\n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis study was supported by on operating grant from the   (grant number MOP-88588) to DD and BGG.

Words are differentially represented in the brain according to their semantic category and these difficulties in ASC predict reduced activation to emotion-related words in limbic structures crucial for affective processing. Semantic theories view \u2018emotion actions\u2019 as critical for learning the semantic relationship between a word and the emotion it describes, such that emotion words typically activate the cortical motor systems involved in expressing emotion actions such as facial expressions. As ASC are also characterised by motor deficits and atypical brain structure and function in these regions, motor structures would also be expected to show reduced activation during emotion-semantic processing. Here we used event-related fMRI to compare passive processing of emotion words in comparison to abstract verbs and animal names in typically-developing controls and individuals with ASC. Relatively reduced brain activation in ASC for emotion words, but not matched control words, was found in motor areas and cingulate cortex specifically. The degree of activation evoked by emotion words in the motor system was also associated with the extent of autistic traits as revealed by the Autism Spectrum Quotient. We suggest that hypoactivation of motor and limbic regions for emotion word processing may underlie difficulties in processing emotional language in ASC. The role that sensorimotor systems and their connections might play in the affective and social-communication difficulties in ASC is discussed. \n   Highlights  \n  \nMotor and limbic cortices are typically activated by emotion words. \n  \nIn ASC, activity in these key regions is reduced for this word type specifically. \n  \nHypoactivity does not appear in brain regions unrelated to emotion word processing. \n  \nASC motor systems' hypoactivity to emotion words correlates with symptomatology. \n  \nMotor deficits may help explain emotion processing problems and other ASC symptoms. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nInherent in Kanner's first description of autism as a \u2018disturbance of affective contact\u2019 ( ), the domain of emotion has been cardinal throughout the history of autism research. Disturbances in the affective domain may help to explain why individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have difficulty in connecting, socializing, communicating, and understanding the hidden mental world of others that drives much of social behaviour ( ). A recent, methodologically rigorous meta-analysis of the emotion recognition literature in autism suggests that a pervasive deficit exists ( ), extending to understanding emotions in vocal cues and nonverbal gestures ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). In terms of emotional expression, studies in autism also indicate lower responsivity to emotional displays of others ( ,  ), a lack of spontaneous mimicry of others' facial expressions ( ,  ,  ), and attenuated physiological response to emotional expressions, pain and distress in others ( ,  ,  ,  ). Vocalisations and facial expressions of affect in autism are characteristically flat or neutral ( ,  ,  ), and may be inappropriately disconnected from the social context in which they appear ( ,  ,  ). Finally, difficulty in identifying and describing emotions verbally, known as alexithymia, is much more prevalent in people with ASC ( ,  ) and their parents ( ). In summary, it seems that individuals with ASC are atypical in how they express emotions in comparison to typically-developing peers and that, likewise, their perception and mirroring of emotions are reduced, if not impaired. \n\nThis pattern of emotion expression and perception deficits is one component of the difficulty in mentalising, the ability to represent one's own emotional states and thought processes and those of others ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). In this sense, deficits in self-referential processing may alter an individual's ability to use the self as a proxy for simulating the mental lives of others. A deficit in representation and/or recognition of one's own emotions would impair attempts to accurately simulate others via oneself ( ). \n\nThe more generalized role of simulation in mental operations is increasingly recognised in the field of cognitive neuroscience, where   names it \u201ca core form of computation in the brain\u201d (pp. 618\u2013619). A proposal which has recently gained speed with much empirical support is that self-performed actions (including those involved in emotional expression) and the perceptual consequences of the same lead to linked action\u2013perception representations that are later used in cognitive processing and social interaction ( ,  ). In action cognition, for example, researchers have suggested that action goals are simulated in the motor systems of observers in order to understand the intentions underlying actions, such as whether or not the actor intends to eat the object ( ). In the context of the mirror neuron theory, these joint action\u2013perception circuits, consisting of these self-same sensorimotor neurons with visual and/or auditory properties, have been found underactive in autism ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nGiven that alexithymia in autism is a   linguistic   deficit in processing the emotions of self and others, this implies that there is atypical processing of words semantically related to emotions. Prior work in autism suggests that these individuals do indeed show difficulty in understanding and using emotional and cognitive mental state terms (such as \u201cdread\u201d, \u201cthought\u201d: see  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) as well as an inability to link mental state terms to emotional information present in features of the eyes ( ,  ). The neural correlates of this deficit are, however, unknown. In the present study we used event-related fMRI to investigate brain systems activated when people with ASC process abstract emotion words. Our hypotheses about atypical cortical activity during emotion word processing focused on two key areas. \n\nIn typically developing (TD) individuals, understanding the meaning of action and emotion words and concepts seems to involve the cortical motor system ( ,  ). Our prior work has shown that individuals with autism show hypoactivity of cortical motor systems when they process action words and concepts ( ,  ), and this is consistent with atypical structure of the motor cortex ( ) and movement impairments in ASC (see  , for review). The motor regions unexpectedly inactive during action word processing in ASC were the same as those found particularly active when TD individuals processed abstract emotion words ( ). Theoretically, this \u2018motor embodiment\u2019 of emotion words suggests that the link between an emotion word and the emotional state it expresses depends on emotion expression in action ( ,  ,  ). In early language acquisition, emotion expression by infants provides a natural context for teaching emotion words and, therefore, the motor and limbic regions for emotion expression may be woven into the semantic representations of abstract emotion-related words. As TMS and work in brain-damaged patients shows that somatosensory and motor regions along with limbic emotion processing areas in insular cortex are necessary for the perception of emotion-related information immanent to the face ( ,  ), and these same areas are also active in emotion word processing ( ,  ), we hypothesised that these cortical motor and limbic systems would be affected in autism during emotion word processing and might reflect the degree of autistic traits in ASC. \n\nAn additional hypothesis focuses on limbic areas involved in emotion processing ( ). A range of these regions, including orbitofrontal and frontopolar cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, and basal ganglia (putamen, caudate, and globus pallidum), are involved in emotion   word   processing (for review see  ,  ). Because these regions are specifically activated by   emotion-related   language, this subset of limbic areas, along with motor systems, provides a putative cortical basis for \u2018simulation\u2019 of word meaning and affective semantics more generally. It has been suggested that, at the neurobiological level, strong emotional-affective associations of emotion words are mechanistically organised as \u2018limbic tails\u2019 of cortical cell assemblies reaching into subcortical structures of the limbic system ( ). In addition to the aforementioned abnormalities of cortical motor systems, people with ASC also show atypical activity and structure in many of these limbic regions ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), so we predict additional hypo-activity in limbic systems when people with ASC process emotion-related words. \n\nIn summary, activation of motor and limbic areas during abstract emotion word processing seen in TD individuals may be atypical in ASC, partly due to their deficits in emotion processing and thus limbic activation, and to deficits in emotion expression in action and thus motor system activity. Whereas limbic hypoactivation might be predicted by the common emotion processing deficits in ASC, the additional prediction of motor hypoactivity in emotion word processing rests on the semantic link between emotion words and motor systems ( ). If the semantic link between an emotion and the word denoting it is via emotion expression in motor behaviour, the motor difficulties reported in ASC imply that this link will be atypical even during single word reading and comprehension, a task unrelated to overt emotion processing. Therefore, if words denoting abstract emotional states draw on cortical motor and limbic regions during processing, atypical functioning may be apparent in both of these regions when individuals with ASC simply read these words. In comparison with words denoting animals or abstract verbs, neither of which are especially linked with motor or limbic regions, we predicted that individuals with ASC would show a category-specific abnormality during emotion word processing that should be specific to the motor and limbic areas that are atypical in ASC and associated with emotion word processing in typical controls. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nRight-handed, native English-speaking participants comprising 18 high-functioning adults with an ASC (mean age: 30.4\u00a0years [standard deviation (SD): 10]; mean IQ: 113.5 [SD: 23]) and 18 age- and IQ-matched typically-developing (TD) controls (mean age: 28.6\u00a0years [SD: 11.7]; mean IQ: 110.2 [SD: 12.3]). Data from TD participants were previously published in  ; here, a new and independent analysis compares these participants and individuals with ASC who were recruited from the volunteer database at  , hosted by the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University, UK. All ASC participants had been previously clinically diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria: 17 met criteria for Asperger Syndrome, one for PDD-NOS (pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified). The ASC group scored significantly higher than the control group (t [32]\u00a0=\u00a06.857, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ: Baron-Cohen et al. 2001b), with a mean score of 34 (SD: 10) in comparison to the control mean AQ of 13 (SD: 5). All but 4 of the ASC group scored above 26 on this test, a cut-off point that captures the majority of adults with autism ( ). In order to keep the procedure short, this experiment matched participants only in full-scale IQ ( ). Although they were not directly matched in verbal IQ, both had performed with no significant differences in accuracy in a general language processing task reported in a previous experiment ( ) and the participants with ASC were high-functioning individuals who had or were currently working or studying, and so seemed to be comparable in their ability to read and understand the task. \n\nAll participants gave written informed consent prior to participating in this study and were remunerated for their time. Ethics approval was provided by NHS Research Ethics Service Cambridgeshire. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nA semantic rating study was carried out prior to the fMRI experiment in order to assess semantic properties for a large corpus of words: these included arousal, valence, imageability, concreteness, visual-relatedness, form-relatedness, colour-relatedness, and action-relatedness. Arousal and valence ratings have previously been employed in work on emotional-affective meaning ( ,  ) to classify words as emotional or non-emotional. Our previous work ( ) used an additional explicit rating of emotion-relatedness to identify words (primarily verbs) specifically used to speak about emotions, such as \u201cdread\u201d, \u201chate\u201d and \u201cfear\u201d. As words with action-related meanings (e.g. \u201ckick\u201d) are also known to activate cortical motor systems, we excluded more concrete emotional items with sensorimotor associations used in the previous study (such as \u201cwail\u201d or \u201cscream\u201d), which were less optimal for exploring \u2018pure\u2019 abstract emotion concepts (see   for details of this and the rating procedure). As such, a more refined category of the most abstract emotion words (20) was contrasted with 40 animal names (nouns such as \u201chawk\u201d, \u201cmouse\u201d, \u201csheep\u201d) and 40 abstract verbs (e.g. \u201cheal\u201d, \u201cdwell\u201d, \u201cwaive\u201d, which also lacked overt or concrete sensorimotor associations with the body). Words were matched in length, number of neighbours, word frequency, bigram and trigram frequency (see Table S1 in supplementary information for psycholinguistic and semantic properties of all experimental word categories). In order to disguise the focus of the study, the experimental words were dispersed among 240 filler words and 120 hash-mark strings (###) which, matched in length with the 360 word stimuli, were used as a low-level visual baseline unrelated to language. \n\nAnimal names were included as a word category unrelated to actions, in order to rule out the possibility of indiscriminate motor activity during general language processing. Whilst a lexical confound existed with the animal name category (nouns), both the emotion and abstract word categories were verbs (or had strong primary use as verbs): any atypical activity which appeared for emotion words but not for abstract verbs could not therefore be ascribed to a general problem with this lexical category. Though matched in word frequency, animal words were rated as significantly more familiar than our other experimental word categories. Abstract verbs, which were not significantly different to emotion words in familiarity (t [58]\u00a0=\u00a0.246, p\u00a0=\u00a0.807) or the concreteness of their meaning (t [58]\u00a0=\u00a0.510, p\u00a0=\u00a0.612), were the stronger control category. All three experimental word categories can be seen in Table S2 (Supplementary materials): they were presented in lowercase just as they appear. \n\n\n### Procedure and experimental design \n  \nPrior to scanning, all subjects completed Form A of the Cattell Culture Fair test ( ) and the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ:  ), in order to obtain measures of IQ and number of autistic traits. The Cattell Culture Fair test is a non-verbal IQ test frequently employed in cognitive neuroscience ( ). It is believed to provide the strongest measure of \u201cfluid\u201d intelligence ( ,  ,  ,  ), that which is distinct from learned verbal material (which influences some subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [ ]) and which is considered to reflect \u201ctrue\u201d problem-solving or abstract reasoning ability ( ,  ) rather than \u2018crystallised\u2019 intelligence (learned knowledge). \n\nEvent-related fMRI was used to compare brain activity during passive silent reading of experimental words, which were presented tachistoscopically for 150\u00a0ms. This short presentation time was employed to discourage saccades and encourage continuous attention in order to perform well on the task. Participants were asked to focus on a central fixation cross (presented for an average of 2350\u00a0ms) following the presentation of word stimuli, with SOA varied at an average of 2500\u00a0ms. Two pseudo-randomised stimulus lists were counterbalanced between subjects, who were instructed to read the words silently without moving their lips or tongue. Observation during scanning ruled out the effect of overt movements on results. \n\nImmediately following scanning, an unseen word recollection test containing a combination of experimental and novel distracter words asked participants to rate how confident they were that each word had appeared in the experimental task. Accurate results confirmed that participants had maintained attention on the experimental task. T-tests confirmed that both groups performed above chance (average hit rate: controls\u00a0=\u00a076.2% (SD\u00a0=\u00a018.1%), ASC\u00a0=\u00a076.2% (SD: 19.1%)), with no significant difference appearing between them in the number of correct answers (t [34]\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a0.018, p\u00a0=\u00a0.913). \n\n\n### Imaging analysis \n  \nParticipants were scanned in a 3\u00a0T Tim-Trio scanner with a 12-channel head-coil attached. Functional scans consisted of 32 slices covering the whole brain in descending order (slice thickness: 3\u00a0mm, in-plane resolution: 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm, inter-slice distance: 0.75\u00a0mm), and echo-planar sequence parameters were TR\u00a0=\u00a02000\u00a0ms TE\u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0ms and flip angle\u00a0=\u00a078\u00b0. SPM5 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK) was employed for all processing stages, including slice-timing and re-aligning using sinc interpolation, co-registration of images to structural T1 images and normalisation of the previous to the 152 subject T1 template of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). Transformation parameters were applied to co-registered EPI images, which were also resampled with a spatial resolution of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0mm and spatially smoothed with an 8-mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel. \n\nSingle-subject, second level and group statistical contrasts were computed using the canonical haemodynamic response function (HRF) of the general linear model. Low-frequency noise was removed by applying a high-pass filter of 128\u00a0s. Onset times for each stimulus were extracted from E-prime output files and integrated into a model for each block in which each stimulus category was modelled as a separate event. Group data were then analysed with a random-effects analysis. Direct statistical contrasts between groups for each word category were computed and voxel coordinates reported in MNI standard space. Statistical thresholding was initially set at a liberal threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a0.001, uncorrected, in order to observe the activation landscape evoked by words but was then followed up by more stringent thresholding at a Family-Wise Error (FWE) corrected level of p\u00a0<\u00a0.05. \n\nIn addition to whole-brain analysis, a regions-of-interest (ROI) investigation was undertaken, using the MarsBar function of SPM5, in order to look for statistical interactions between brain regions, word category and group in an ANOVA approach. ROIs were created by pooling participants from both groups and assessing regions where brain activity was robust for the general language contrast of all words against the hash-mark baseline. The three clusters (each with 3 peak loci) with most highly significant t values at a FWE-corrected threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a0.05 were selected for detailed analysis in 5\u00a0mm-radius ROIs. Activation was collapsed across the 3 peaks within each cluster to form the factor of Area for statistical analysis. These three Areas for analysis therefore included a left-hemispheric temporal cluster (its collapsed peaks located in inferior temporal [\u2212\u00a060, \u2212\u00a034, \u2212\u00a02] and fusiform gyrus [\u2212\u00a040, \u2212\u00a044, \u2212\u00a018, and \u2212\u00a042, \u2212\u00a04, \u2212\u00a044]: henceforth referred to as the \u201cTemporal cluster\u201d); a left-hemispheric cingulate cluster (collapsed loci in dorsal medial BA 6 [\u2212\u00a06, \u2212\u00a02, 64] and cingulate cortex at BA 32 [\u2212\u00a06, 16, 40] and BA 23 [\u2212\u00a08, \u2212\u00a08, 46]; henceforth the \u201cCingulate cluster\u201d); and a right hemispheric motor cluster (its collapsed loci in primary motor [BA 4: 52, \u2212\u00a08, 42] and premotor cortex [BA 6: 62, 4, 12, and 60, 2, 38]; henceforth the \u201cMotor cluster\u201d). As can be seen in   Part A, the activity evoked by general reading spread across disparate areas, and consequently, a peak arose within the same cluster as the temporal ROIs that was actually located in left premotor cortex (BA 6: \u2212\u00a042, \u2212\u00a04, 44). As this peak could not be included in the Temporal cluster within the ANOVA described below, it was analysed separately. After analysing at these 3 Areas (collapsed across 3 ROIs in each), their homologues in the contralateral hemisphere were computed, and these homologues (themselves collapsed from individual peaks into Areas mirroring those in the left hemisphere) were averaged with the originals in order to carry out a bilateral analysis. \n\nFinally, correlations between AQ scores and activity in these three bilateral Areas for each of the three word categories (3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 tests) were examined in the ASC group. On observing the data, two clear outliers were observed who scored very low in ASC traits, more than 10 points below the typical cut-off point of 26 ( ). The AQ is not a diagnostic measure but in this previous work, it reliably identified people with ASC in 83% of tested cases. It was noted that one of our outliers was in fact the one participant with PDD-NOS, which has also been known as \u201catypical autism\u201d, being a diagnostic label for cases which meet many but not all the prototypical symptoms of autism or which have additional, uncharacteristic symptoms. These two individuals were more comparable with the control group for AQ scores (see Supplementary materials, image S4). These two participants were identified as outliers in the ASC group on two fronts, being more than 2 standard deviations from the group's mean AQ and secondly through calculation of the median absolute deviation (see  , for details of this recommended method for outlier identification). They were removed from the correlation analysis but kept in brain-imaging analyses for the sake of matching group size; checks were made to guarantee that removal of these outliers did not affect significance in the other findings. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nActivity during general word processing (all word categories against the hash-mark baseline), pooled across all participants, revealed widespread activity which was strongly left-lateralised across perisylvian language regions (fusiform to superior temporal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus), plus activity in the motor system bilaterally. \n\nDirect between-group statistical contrasts at a FWE-corrected whole-brain level revealed a range of cortical regions for each word category which were activated more strongly in the typically-developing (TD) control participants than in the ASC group. Regions where emotion words evoked greater activity in TD than ASC participants are displayed in   and   (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE corr.). These included a large cluster of voxels (n\u00a0=\u00a02438) encompassing left-hemispheric motor systems (BA 4 and 6) and the insula, and additional clusters in the left fusiform gyrus and the right-hemispheric motor system (BA 6). A left-hemispheric cluster including the anterior cingulate and caudate nucleus was also more strongly activated by emotion words in TD than ASC subjects, but this cluster did not survive FWE correction. Areas more strongly activated by the control word categories in the control participants are displayed in Supplementary Materials (Table S3), though none survived FWE correction. The contrast of ASC\u00a0>\u00a0control participants was non-significant at whole-brain level for each word category.   \nAreas of greater activity for emotion words in Control vs. ASC participants. \n      \nStatistical group contrast (controls\u00a0>\u00a0ASC) for emotion words (red). Activation is thresholded at p\u00a0<\u00a0.001, but the yellow parts of the activation clusters reflect activity which survived FWE (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) correction. \n  \n\nIn a secondary ROI analysis, activation for each word category was examined in three large clusters of activity (left temporal, cingulate, and right motor cortex) that arose from the contrast of all words against the hash-mark baseline for all subjects pooled. The coordinates of the loci collapsed in each cluster can be seen in  , part A.   \nPart A): Activation for all words as contrasted against the hash-mark baseline, presented at a threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a0.001 for all subjects pooled. Individual loci, depicted above, were collapsed in the analysis to form one Temporal cluster, one Cingulate cluster and one Motor cluster. Part B): Graphs depict activity for each word category in each cluster. Significant Word Category\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Group interactions, driven by between-group differences marked by asterisks (*), were found in the Cingulate and Motor clusters. Mean activation for the control participants is in blue, for the ASC participants in red. Error bars reflect standard error. \n  \n\nThese clusters were entered into an ANOVA including the factors Area (3 levels: Temporal, Cingulate, Motor), Word Category (3 levels: animal names, abstract verbs, and emotion words) and Group (2 levels). This revealed a significant (following Huynh\u2013Feldt correction) interaction of Area, Word Category and Group:   F  (4, 136)\u00a0=\u00a04.833, p\u00a0=\u00a0.001. The left motor ROI, which arose as part of the cluster of activity with the Temporal ROIs but which was analysed separately, did not produce a significant main effect of Word Category (p\u00a0=\u00a0.09) or a Word Category interaction with Group (p\u00a0=\u00a0.866), though greatest activity for emotion words over other word types was seen in both groups. \n\nThe interaction of Area, Word Category and Group was unpacked in an analysis of each Area separately, employing an ANOVA with the factors Word Category (3 levels) and Group. Significant interactions between Word Category and Group were present only in Cingulate and Motor clusters (see  ,  ). Post-hoc t-tests of these interactions revealed significant between-group differences for emotion but not comparison word categories in both the Cingulate (  t  (34)\u00a0=\u00a02.116, p\u00a0=\u00a0.042) and Motor (  t  (34)\u00a0=\u00a02.867, p\u00a0=\u00a0.007) Areas. In fact, this hypoactivity for emotion words in the Cingulate Area correlated with the hypoactivity for emotion words seen in the Motor area (r\u00a0=\u00a0863, p\u00a0=\u00a0.001), although no other correlations were seen between brain activity for word categories in other regions.   \nSignificant interactions in key regional clusters. \n    \n\nA bilateral analysis using homologues of the ROIs collapsed in these three clusters confirmed this pattern of hypoactivity, producing an interaction of Area, Word Category and Group which was significant following Huynh\u2013Feldt correction (  F  (4, 136)\u00a0=\u00a03.993, p\u00a0=\u00a0.004). Again, post-hoc analysis revealed that emotion words were the only word category to differ significantly between groups in the bilateral Cingulate (  t  (34)\u00a0=\u00a02.145, p\u00a0=\u00a0.039) and Motor (  t  (34)\u00a0=\u00a02.826, p\u00a0=\u00a0.008) Areas. \n\nWithin group analysis of all three major clusters together showed no significant word category differences for ASC, but several in the control group (  F  [2, 34]\u00a0=\u00a03.444, \u03b5\u00a0=\u00a0.906, p\u00a0=\u00a0.043). These were significant in the Motor Area (F [2, 34]\u00a0=\u00a08.049, \u03b5\u00a0=\u00a01.000, p\u00a0=\u00a0.001), where greater activity was evoked by emotion words than by animal names (  t  (17)\u00a0=\u00a03.413, p\u00a0=\u00a0.003) or abstract verbs (  t  (17)\u00a0=\u00a03.002, p\u00a0=\u00a0.008) respectively. \n\nCorrelations between bilateral activity for each word category in the three key clusters and the AQ were explored in order to assess a potential behavioural link with the hypoactivity for emotion words described above. Following the removal of two outliers (see Methods for detail), a highly significant correlation between activity elicited by emotion words in the Motor Area bilaterally and AQ score (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a0.679, p\u00a0=\u00a0.004) was seen in the ASC group. This correlation reflected that higher scores, indicating a greater number of autistic traits, were associated with lower activity to emotion words in the Motor Areas (see Supplementary materials, item S4). It remained significant following Bonferroni correction (to a corrected p-value of 0.0056, based on 9 tests) and confirmation with a non-parametric test (Spearman's Rho: r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a0.677, p\u00a0=\u00a0.004). We did not find any significant correlations between AQ scores and activity for any of the other categories in the motor Area, and no significant correlations between AQ scores and activity for any word category in the cingulate or temporal Areas. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nBrain activation elicited during passive reading of abstract emotion words and two comparison control categories was compared in ASC and typically-developing (TD) control participants. Whole-brain analyses of activity evoked by emotion words showed significantly reduced neurometabolic responses in ASC, specifically in bilateral motor areas and in the left insula and basal ganglia. ROI analysis confirmed and extended these findings. A statistically-significant interaction of the factors Area (3 levels: temporal, cingulate, motor), Word category (3) and group (2) revealed that in cingulate and motor areas (the former including BA 23, BA 32, the latter primary motor and premotor cortex [BA 4 and 6 respectively]), people with ASC showed significantly reduced activity than controls for emotion words, but not for abstract verbs and animal names. Reduced activity in the ASC group for emotion words did not appear in temporal cortex but only specifically in the motor and insular regions where the same TD controls showed the strongest emotion word-evoked activity ( ). Furthermore, motor systems activation in people with ASC significantly correlated with their number of autistic traits, as assessed by AQ scores. \n\n### Action binds words to emotional meaning \n  \nAlongside elevated rates of alexithymia ( ,  ) and general deficits in emotion processing and recognition ( ), people with ASC show difficulty in the processing of mental or emotional states and words semantically related to emotions ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). As these impairments must reflect a neurological correlate, we hypothesised that substantial differences might exist in how these individuals process and store words with emotional meaning. \n\nAgainst a background of extensive atypical limbic structure and function in ASC (see  ), reduced activity here for emotion-related words is not in itself a surprising finding. Due to the poor temporal resolution of fMRI, it is not possible to determine whether limbic hypo-activation to emotion words reflects general problems with late stage, conscious   post-understanding   processing of emotion words or a deactivation of these emotion concepts in the earliest time window when semantic differences are reflected by brain response ( ,  ). Reduced activity in the limbic system was however accompanied by and correlated with reduced activity in the motor system, which in turn reflected the degree of autistic traits in the ASC group. On the basis of this data, we would venture to suggest that the under-activation in limbic systems and its accompanying motor hypoactivity are a hallmark of autism rather than an epiphenomenon. \n\nCortical language and motor systems are tightly entwined, such that passive language perception activates motor regions in a general fashion, as if simulating the spoken or written language ( ,  ,  ). Over and above this, however, semantic theory and experimental data suggest that the meanings of both action words ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ; see  , for review)   and   emotion words ( ) are \u2018embodied\u2019 in cortical motor systems \u2014 such that words do not activate these areas equally. Action words are represented somatotopically such that they activate the cortical motor regions for the effectors involved in that action. For emotion words, the link between emotions and the symbols (words) denoting them may be established by way of actions, and motor activation in emotion word processing may therefore index this link. Cortical motor systems are the vehicle of emotion expression. Because they refer to abstract concepts such as \u201cfear\u201d which cannot be easily pointed to or labelled, the meaning of emotion words is established by the use of the words in action contexts \u2014 facial expressions and emotional behaviours such as crying, screaming and gesticulating. As the only visible \u2018signals\u2019 of internal emotional states, semantic theory postulates that these actions are critical for bridging the gap between word and meaning and so, in the typical population, become incorporated in the neural network representing the meaning of these emotion terms ( ). During this process, the word comes to be associated with the internal feeling it describes, and so, in addition, these words possess \u2018limbic tails\u2019 ( ), activating neurons in limbic structures involved in processing the specific emotions denoted by these words. In the typically-developing participants, these areas included the orbitofrontal and frontopolar cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, and basal ganglia including putamen, caudate, and globus pallidum ( ; areas also highlighted in abstract word processing, see  ). In the motor system, these participants showed the greatest activity in motor systems for emotion words and the lowest for animal names with little or no semantic relationship to actions. Though abstract words, too, may be partially grounded in a multitude of sensorimotor action contexts ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), they are detached from   specific   action schemas ( ,  ). As such, despite equal ratings in action-relatedness, they evoked less activity in cortical motor systems than did emotion words, and the hierarchy of motor activation in our typical population \u2013 highest for emotion words, lowest for animal names as according with their action-relatedness \u2013 sits comfortably within the previous literature ( ). \n\nIn comparison to the typically-developing participants, individuals with ASC here exhibited reduced activity for emotion words in limbic and motor regions (primary motor and premotor cortex, the insula, cingulate and caudate nucleus: see  ). That reduced motor and limbic activity was restricted to emotion words, but not other word types, is evidence for the atypical alteration of the action-semantic link (via behaviours involving motor systems) between emotion words and their related emotions. Stringent matching of our word categories, particularly the abstract verbs, allowed us to refute the possibility that participants with ASC might have a particular difficulty with   all   verbs, or with all words of an abstract nature. The cause of the group difference in activity for emotion words can therefore be presumed to be related to the emotional and mental state content of emotion words (e.g. \u201cdread\u201d) that was absent in the case of equally abstract verbs such as \u201cdwell\u201d, revealing a genuine category-specific semantic abnormality. \n\n\n### The role of motor systems in emotion word processing, alexithymia and ASC \n  \nThe pattern of activity in the control group, who in a previous analysis showed substantial overlap in the motor activity evoked by abstract emotion words such as \u201cfear\u201d and that evoked by overt action words such as \u201cfrown\u201d, is consistent with the theoretical grounding of emotional concepts via actions ( ). The precise role of such motor activity for emotional words, however, is as yet unclear. \n\nSemantic theory postulates that words are represented in distributed \u201caction\u2013perception circuits\u201d which link the representation of phonology and articulatory word features in core perisylvian language cortices with the representation of meaning in sensorimotor systems ( ). Functional importance of these sensorimotor systems for the processing of action words is supported by a plethora of empirical work, which demonstrates a common neural substrate for movement and the understanding of action-related language ( ,  ). Among the strongest evidence is that relating deficits in action word processing to damage or disease of the motor system ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The bidirectional influence between motor systems and action-semantic processing is such that differences were observed in the same patients with Parkinson's disease before and after dopaminergic treatment ( ). Of the greatest relevance to the present dataset is our previous research, which demonstrated abnormalities and a deficit in action word processing in individuals with autism. A significant correlation was seen between hypoactivity for action words in motor cortex and slowness in a task of semantic processing: as activity in motor systems decreased in participants with ASC, reaction times for action word processing increased ( ). This was a very course-grained task, simply asking participants to categorise words as actions or objects, which may be why this impairment did not manifest in significantly greater errors. The fact that autistic participants were nonetheless significantly impeded in this very simple task suggests, however, that they might be substantially impaired in more complex or subtle action word processing tasks, as were the patients described above. The motor hypoactivity for action words that we had observed with fMRI was further corroborated with temporally precise combined EEG-MEG recording of autistic participants (Moseley et al., 2014). \n\nAs we did not conduct a behavioural test of emotion word processing, we cannot here show a relationship between the hypoactivity seen in motor and limbic regions and emotion word processing errors or impairment. We would hypothesise that, as for action words, this activation plays a functional role in their processing \u2014 and would accordingly predict autistic participants to show category-specific deficits for emotion words when these are compared with other well-matched word stimuli. Modulation of motor systems certainly affects processing of emotion-related language ( ), such that lesions or disorder of these areas would be expected to produce impairments. \n\nThough we did not conduct our own behavioural test of word processing, the motor and limbic hypoactivity seen specifically for emotion words in this analysis is consistent with other autism research reporting difficulties understanding and using emotion words, and with general emotion processing impairments. At the neural level, it is consistent with the atypical structural features in limbic regions and primary motor cortex in ASC ( ), and with movement impairments in autism ( ). In order to investigate a functional connection between motor and limbic systems activity and emotion word processing, and thus link the present data with reported impairments, future research should investigate the overlap of movement impairment and alexithymia in ASC and directly test the correlation between hypoactivity and category-specific deficits in active behavioural tasks involving processing words related to emotions. In such an investigation, it would also be optimal to measure alexithymia directly by means of a specialised scale. We attempted to retrospectively collect data using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20:  ) after our study finished, but unfortunately had few respondents from our sample, such that the hypothesised relationship between motor/limbic hypoactivity and alexithymia itself (as opposed to the autism measure included in this study) remains tentative. Interestingly, the present study observed a significant correlation, whilst reading emotion words, between hypoactivity in the motor system and hypoactivity in the cingulate cortex (though not with activity in other regions examined, ruling out any general hypoactivity). Although causal primacy of emotion expression deficits (associated with atypical motor circuits) over emotion processing/recognition deficits (associated with atypical limbic cortices) cannot be supported by this data, the correlation between motor and limbic hypoactivity observed here does imply a relationship between the capacity to express one's emotions and the capacity to process and understand the emotions of the self and others, as implied in the idea of the self as proxy for emotion processing ( ). \n\nExamination of ASC through the prism of movement disorder was considered by   but has been overshadowed by studies of the more prominent social-communication symptoms. More recently, however, atypical sensorimotor circuits have been argued to have wider implications for ASC, as they are suggested to contribute in a simulative manner to mentalising ( ) and other aspects of social cognition such as empathy ( ). Alexithymia is just one indication of impairments in self-referential processing ( ), and the idea that the self is used as a proxy suggests that this impairment may be associated with the broader meta-representational deficit in autism. If conceptual understanding of emotion concepts requires the involvement of motor systems then these broad impairments may be a downstream reflection of fundamental abnormalities in motor circuits. Other social-communication impairments in ASC might similarly arise from motor dysfunction, given the relationship between motor, social and language development in childhood ( ,  ) and the early emergence of motor abnormalities prior to other features of ASC ( ,  ,  ,  ). In ASC, correlations have been noted between movement difficulties and impaired social-communication skills ( ). In addition, motor impairment predicts childhood and adolescent speech fluency and delay in both children with autism and their high-risk siblings ( ,  ). In a previous publication, we demonstrated an association between motor hypoactivity and a category-specific impairment for action words ( ). This study also found a correlation between motor hypoactivity and AQ scores, a notable finding given that the AQ largely measures the social difficulties and narrow interests in ASC and makes no reference to motor symptoms which would be naturally expected to correlate with motor hypoactivity.   study fits with the perspective that brain circuits involving motor systems may underpin many higher cognitive processes. \n\nGiven this relationship between motor abnormality and ASC, the present work investigated the correlation between activity in motor areas evoked by emotion words and autistic traits. A highly significant correlation was seen between AQ scores in the ASC group and activity evoked by emotion words in the motor system bilaterally. This finding appeared following removal of two outliers, so further investigation with greater numbers is important to confirm this. It may be that impairment in emotion expression (dependent on the integrity of motor circuits controlling emotional behaviours) is a hallmark of autism and precedes and underlies the development of other symptoms, a perspective consistent with the aforementioned developmental primacy of motor symptoms of ASC. This suggestion requires further investigation in a non-correlational approach for statements of causal primacy to be justified. \n\nConsistent with the previous finding related to action word processing ( ), the current data demonstrates a relationship between autistic traits and motor system hypoactivity during processing of   another   word-type associated with motor systems ( ). As motor systems are typically involved in processing both action words and emotion words, the hypoactivity seen here is symptomatic of underlying abnormalities in motor circuits (and/or their connections) that correlate with ASC traits. It suggests a relationship between disorder of sensorimotor systems (and/or their connections) and the emotional-affective and socio-communicative difficulties seen in ASC. Further research is clearly necessary to elucidate a putative link between motor systems abnormality, emotion word processing deficits, and other socio-communicative symptoms of ASC. The role of motor systems in higher cognitive processes is increasingly recognised in neuroscience ( ,  ,  ,  ), and given the relationship between motor, cognitive and emotional processing, further study of motor impairments and their role in ASC may be timely and fruitful for interventions. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nUsing event-related fMRI, we explored the representation of emotion words in comparison to abstract verbs and animal names in the typical population and people with ASC. Our data revealed substantial differences between participant groups at a whole-brain level: the control group showed significantly greater activity for emotion words in motor cortex and limbic regions such as the cingulate and the basal ganglia, all of which have previously been implicated in emotion and emotion word processing. In addition, more thorough ROI analysis of temporal, cingulate and motor regions revealed a category-specific reduction for emotion words in the cingulate cortex and the motor system \u2014 both regions previously implicated in emotion word processing. This hypoactivation is consistent with ASC deficits in emotion expression and mentalising outside the language domain. We suggest this may constitute an underlying neural substrate for impairments in emotion word processing, which seems to rely on these motor and limbic cortical areas. We also report a significant correlation between motor hypoactivity in ASC and the expression of autistic traits. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis work was supported by the   (MC_US_A060_0034, U1055.04.003.00001.01 to F.P., MC_US_A060_0043, MC-A060-5PQ90 to Y.

{"text": "Hu, Sien and Chao, Herta H.-A. and Winkler, Alissa D. and Li, Chiang-shan R.\nFront Aging Neurosci, 2012\n\n# Title\n\nThe effects of age on cerebral activations: internally versus externally driven processes\n\n# Keywords\n\nage\naging\ninhibitory control\nendogenous\nexogenous\ngo/no-go\nrace model\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nNumerous studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have described increased or decreased regional brain activations in older as compared to younger adults. This seeming inconsistency may reflect differences in the psychological constructs examined across studies. We hypothesized that behavioral tasks/contrasts engaging internally and externally driven processes are each associated with age-related decreases and increases, respectively, in cerebral activations. We examined the fMRI data of 103 healthy adults, 18\u201372 years of age, performing a stop signal task (SST), in which a frequent \u201cgo\u201d signal triggered a prepotent response and a less frequent \u201cstop\u201d signal prompted inhibition of this response. Greater internally driven processes lead to stop successes (SS) as compared to stop errors (SE), and to speeding up instead of slowing down in go trials. Conversely, externally driven processes contribute to SE trials, which resulted from habitual, unmonitored responses triggered by the go signal (as compared to SS trials), and involved perceptual and cognitive processes elicited by the stop signal (as compared to go trials). Consistent with our hypothesis, the results showed age-related decreases and increases in cerebral activations each during these respective internally and externally driven processes. These findings further elucidate the influence of age on cognitive functioning and provide an additional perspective to understand the imaging literature of aging. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAge is associated with changes in cognitive performance (Cabeza,  ; Park and Reuter-Lorenz,  ). Numerous functional imaging studies examined the neural bases of such changes and described increased or decreased regional brain activations in older as compared to younger adults. Extant literature reported predominantly decreased cerebral activation when the tasks or psychological contrasts reflect internally driven processes. These internally driven processes direct attention to relevant information as dictated by goals, memory mechanisms such as encoding and recalling, switching of response strategy, anticipation, and shifting of attention as instructed by an endogenous cue (Posner,  ; Posner and Petersen,  ; Corbetta and Shulman,  ; Hahn et al.,  ; Gazzaley and D'Esposito,  ; Pattyn et al.,  ). For instance, comparing active recall with simple recognition of words, Cabeza et al. ( ) and Johnson et al. ( ) reported age-related decreases in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortical (DLPFC) activation. Thomsen et al. ( ) reported age-related decreases in DLPFC activation when participants were cued endogenously to shift attention to one ear in a dichotic-listening task. When participants maintained eye fixation while covertly attending to a peripheral target, prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia decreased activations in older as compared to younger adults (Solbakk et al.,  ). In a continuous performance task, Braver and Barch ( ) showed age-related decreases in left DLPFC activation during the delay period. Age-related decreases in cortical activations were also observed in the left DLPFC as well as other frontal and parietal structures during verbal and face encoding, where internally driven processes predominate in these tasks (Grady et al.,  ; Logan et al.,  ; Nyberg et al.,  ; Otsuka et al.,  ). \n\nIn contrast, age-related increased activations are frequently observed when the behavioral tasks or contrasts involve processes that are predominantly externally driven, as when attention is drawn to salient or novel stimuli that appear suddenly or unpredictably during target recognition and reflexive eye movements (Posner,  ; Posner and Petersen,  ; Corbetta and Shulman,  ; Hahn et al.,  ; Gazzaley and D'Esposito,  ; Pattyn et al.,  ). For instance, compared to younger adults, older people demonstrated increased activation during word recognition than recall in the right anterior DLPFC (Cabeza et al.,  ; Jimura and Braver,  ). In recognition of famous vs. non-famous people's names, older adults showed greater activation in the left medial PFC, left inferior frontal cortex (IFC), and right hippocampus (Nielson et al.,  ). Bilateral frontal and supplementary eye fields showed age-related increases in activations during visually guided saccadic eye movements (Nelles et al.,  ). Older adults also showed increased activation in the pre-supplementary motor area and bilateral inferior frontal gyri (Zysset et al.,  ), as well as in the left PFC and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) (Mathis et al.,  ), when matching incongruent vs. congruent stimuli. \n\nOverall, these findings suggest that age is associated with decreased and increased cerebral activations each during internally and externally driven processes. We tested this hypothesis by using a large functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set collected on the stop signal task (SST). In the SST, participants are required to respond to a go signal and withdraw their response when a stop signal appears. Because go trials are more frequent (\u223c75%) than stop trials (\u223c25%), the task sets up a prepotent response\u2014pressing a button to the go signal. Thus, successful stopping in the stop trials requires constant monitoring of the stop signal. When participants are engaged in unmonitored responses\u2014as when they are not watching out for the stop signal\u2014in a trial when the stop signal does appear, they are more likely to fail in stopping than when they are monitoring for the stop signal. Thus, stop success (SS) involves greater allocation of attention and response inhibition than stop error (SE) trials (Li et al.,  ,  ; Chao et al.,  ; Duann et al.,  ). \n\nConversely, compared to SS trials, SE trials involve activities related to unmonitored responses and activities that are elicited by the error signals (Li et al.,  ). Similarly, compared to go success (GS), SE trials share activities of motor execution but involve additional odd-ball (infrequency of stop trials) and error-specific responses. Therefore, a contrast of SE > SS and SE > GS engages greater externally driven processes (Ide and Li,  , ; Zhang and Li,  ). In addition, as we showed previously, participants tend to slow down in their go trial responses with time during the SST. While participants maintained an adequate success rate (>95%) in go responses, the mean go reaction time (goRT) increased monotonically across sessions (Chao et al.,  ). This occurs presumably because of a gradual change of response strategy or shift to a more \u201cconservative\u201d mental set. Despite a general trend in slowing down during go responses, participants varied from trial to trial in their goRT. Thus, a go trial in which participants speed up, compared to all previous go trials, potentially represents a distinct scenario where they decide to deviate from the norm in go responses, risking that a stop signal is not imminent. We thus examined whether these go trials, in which they showed a decreased goRT (as compared to the mean goRT of all previous go trials), would actually involve specific regional brain activations, as compared to those go trials that showed an increased goRT (Li et al.,  ; Yan and Li,  ; Bednarski et al.,  ). Indeed, the results showed a distinct network of cortical and subcortical activations that have previously been implicated in risk taking (Li et al.,  ). Thus, a decision to speed up rather than to slow down after a go trial is internally driven, as participants risk for a no-show of the stop signal in that trial (Li et al.,  ). \n\nAltogether, we can specify four distinct contrasts, two of which each involved predominantly internally and externally driven processes, in the SST. The SST thus offered a unique opportunity to examine the hypothesis with a single behavioral task. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants and behavioral task \n  \nOne hundred and three healthy adults (51 females) with a mean age of 32.5 (SD = 12.4) years participated in the study (Table  ). Participants met the following criteria for recruitment: age 18 and older; right-handed and able to read and write English; no current or history of diagnosis of any Axis I psychiatric or substance (except nicotine) use disorders (First et al.,  ); no current use of psychotropic medications; no significant current medical including neurological, cardiovascular, endocrine, renal, hepatic, or thyroid disorders. Women who were pregnant or breast feeding were not recruited. Participants tested negative for cocaine, amphetamines, opioids, and benzodiazepines prior to fMRI. All participants signed a written consent after they were given a detailed explanation of the study in accordance with a protocol approved by the Yale Human Investigation Committee. \n  \n The number of subjects broken down by age and gender  . \n  \nAll participants performed a SST (Figure  ; Logan et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Chao et al.,  ; Hu and Li,  ). In the SST, two types of trials, \u201cGO\u201d and \u201cSTOP\u201d were randomly presented with an inter-trial-interval (ITI) of 2 s (the time between the end of the previous trial and the start of the current trial). A fixation dot appeared on the screen to signal the beginning of each trial. The dot was replaced by a circle\u2014the go signal\u2014after a time interval, the \u201cfore-period,\u201d which varied from 1 to 5 s (with uniform distribution). The randomized fore-period minimized anticipation and allowed jittering of events of interest. Participants were instructed to press a button on a hand-held button box using the right index finger when they saw the circle. The circle disappeared at button press or after 1 s if the participant failed to respond. \n  \n Stop signal paradigm.   In GO trials (approximately 75%, Trial N), participants responded to the go signal (a circle); in STOP trials (approximately 25%, Trial N + 1), they had to withhold the response when they saw the stop signal (a cross). In both trials, the go signal appeared after a randomized time interval between 1 and 5 s (the fore-period or FP, uniform distribution) following the appearance of the fixation point. The stop signal followed the go signal by a time delay\u2014the stop signal delay (SSD). The SSD was updated according to a staircase procedure, whereby it increased or decreased by 67 ms following a stop success (SS) or stop error (SE) trial, respectively. The inter-trial-interval (ITI) was 2 s. In this diagram, a GO trial was followed by a STOP trial to illustrate the two trial types and the ITI. \n  \nIn approximately one quarter of the trials, the circle was followed by a \u201ccross\u201d\u2014the stop signal. Participants were instructed to withhold button press when they saw the stop signal. The trial terminated at button press or after 1 s if the participant successfully inhibited the response. The time between the go and stop signals, the stop signal delay (SSD), started at 200 ms and varied from one stop trial to the next according to a staircase procedure. If the participant successfully inhibited the response, the SSD increased by 67 ms in the next stop trial; if the participant failed in inhibiting the response, the SSD decreased by 67 ms. With the staircase procedure we anticipated that participants would succeed in withholding the response half of the time. \n\nParticipants were trained briefly on the task before imaging to ensure that they understood the task. They were instructed to quickly press the button when they saw the go signal while keeping in mind that a stop signal might come up in some trials. In the scanner, they completed four sessions of the task, each lasting 10 min, with approximately 100 trials in each session. \n\n\n### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nA critical SSD was computed for each participant that represented the time delay required for the participant to successfully withhold a response in half of the stop trials (Levitt,  ). SSDs across stop trials were grouped into runs (sequences of trials), with each run defined as a monotonically increasing or decreasing series. We derived a mid-run estimate by taking the middle SSD of every second run. The critical SSD was computed by taking the mean of all mid-run SSDs. It was reported that, except for experiments with a small number of trials (less than 30), the mid-run estimate was close to the maximum likelihood estimate of   X   (50% SS in the SST, Wetheril et al.,  ). The stop signal reaction time (SSRT) was then computed for each participant by subtracting the critical SSD from the median go trial reaction time (goRT) (Logan et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Imaging protocol \n  \nConventional T1-weighted spin-echo sagittal anatomical images were acquired for slice localization using a 3T scanner (Siemens Trio). Anatomical images of the functional slice locations were next obtained with spin-echo imaging in the axial plan parallel to the AC-PC line with TR = 300 ms, TE = 2.5 ms, bandwidth = 300 Hz/pixel, flip angle = 60\u00b0, field of view = 220 \u00d7 220 mm, matrix = 256 \u00d7 256, 32 slices with slice thickness = 4 mm and no gap. Functional blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals were then acquired with a single-shot gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence. Thirty-two axial slices parallel to the AC-PC line covering the whole brain were acquired with TR = 2000 ms, TE = 25 ms, bandwidth = 2004 Hz/pixel, flip angle = 85\u00b0, field of view = 220 \u00d7 220 mm, matrix = 64 \u00d7 64, 32 slices with slice thickness = 4 mm and no gap. Three hundred images were acquired in each run for a total of four runs. \n\n\n### Spatial pre-procsesing of brain images \n  \nData were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London, UK). Images from the first five TRs at the beginning of each trial were discarded to enable the signal to achieve steady-state equilibrium between radio frequency pulsing and relaxation. Images of each participant were realigned (motion-corrected) and corrected for slice timing. A mean functional image volume was constructed for each participant for each run from the realigned image volumes. These mean images were co-registered with the high resolution structural image and then segmented for normalization to an MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) EPI template with affine registration followed by non-linear transformation (Friston et al.,  ; Ashburner and Friston,  ). Finally, images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm at Full Width at Half Maximum. \n\n\n### General linear model \n  \nThere were four possible trial outcomes: GS, go error (GE), SS, and SE. A statistical analytical design was constructed for each participant using the general linear model (GLM) with the onsets of the go signal from every trial convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and the temporal derivative of the canonical HRF (Friston et al.,  ). For GS trials, the go signal onset was parametrically modulated by the reaction time and its temporal derivative; for SS and SE trials, the go signal onset was parametrically modulated by the SSD and its temporal derivative (Li et al.,  ). Realignment parameters in all six dimensions were also entered in the model. Serial autocorrelation of the time series was corrected by a first degree autoregressive or AR (1) model (Friston et al.,  ; Della-Maggiore et al.,  ). The data were high-pass filtered (1/128 Hz cutoff) to remove low-frequency signal drifts. The GLM estimated the component of variance that could be explained by each of the regressors. \n\nA contrast of SS > SE, SE > SS, and SE > GS was made from the first GLM for individual participants. Compared to SE, SS trials involved greater internally driven processes such as attentional monitoring and response inhibition. Compared to SS and GS trials, SE trials involved habitual, unmonitored response to the go signal and error feedbacks, respectively; thus both SE > SS and SE > GS involved externally driven processes. \n\nIn the second GLM, the GS trials were divided into those that are followed by a GS (pG), GE (pGE), SS (pSS), and SE (pSE) trial, with pG trials further divided into those that decreased in goRT (pGd) and increased in goRT (pGi), as compared to the mean of all previous GS trials (Li et al.,  ). We contrasted for individual participants pGd > pGi (post-go speeding > post-go slowing), a process that is internally driven and involves a decision to risk that an upcoming trial will not be a stop trial. \n\nAltogether, we thus had four contrasts, two of which (SS > SE and pGd > pGi) were predominately internally driven and the other two (SE > SS and SE > GS) externally driven. In group level analyzes, we ran a one-sample   t  -test to identify regions of interest (ROI) for each of the four contrasts. We then performed a multiple regression against age and gender for each of the four contrasts with small volume correction (SVC) for the ROIs. By regressing only voxels of the ROIs identified for each contrast, we ensured that the correlations with age reflect an association specific to the psychological construct of interest. For instance, a positive correlation of age with the contrast SS > SE would identify only voxels that showed greater activation during SS as compared to SE trials, reflecting attentional monitoring and response inhibition. Without restricting the regression to the ROIs, a positive correlation of age with SS > SE would also identify voxels that correlated negatively with age for SE > SS. \n\nWe used MarsBaR (Brett et al.,  ) to derive for each participant the effect size of activity change for the ROIs identified in each contrast for the regression with age. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral performance \n  \nTable   summarized behavioral performance on the SST. On average, participants made errors in about half of the stop trials, suggesting that their overall performance was adequately tracked by the staircase procedure. We correlated behavioral performance with age (Figure  ). Pearson's correlations showed that the median goRT, SSRT, and the GS rate were significantly correlated with age (Median goRT,   r   = 0.2606,   p   = 0.0078; SSRT,   r   = 0.3703,   p   = 0.0001; GS%,   r   = \u22120.3218,   p   = 0.0009), and the SS rate showed a trend toward significant correlation with age (SS%,   r   = 0.2046,   p   = 0.0382), corrected for multiple comparisons (  p   < 0.0083). The fore-period effect (  r   = \u22120.1067,   p   = 0.2833) and the post-error slowing (  r   = \u22120.0287,   p   = 0.7739) were not correlated with age. \n  \n Behavioral performance on the stop signal task (  n   = 103)  . \n  \nNote: goRT: go trial reaction time; SSRT: stop signal reaction time; GS%: percentage of go success trials in all go trials; SS%: percentage of stop success trials in all stop trials; FP: fore-period; PES: post-error slowing. Effect sizes rather than mean changes were computed for FP effect and PES to account for slight variation in the number of trials between participants. \n    \n Linear correlation between behavioral performance and age.   In each panel, each data point represents one participant and the line indicates the regression fit. \n  \n\n### The effects of age on regional brain activations \n  \nWe first examined the influence of gender by including both age and gender in the regressions. The results showed no regional activations associated with gender at   p   < 0.001 uncorrected. We, therefore, reported age-related activations by combining men and women. \n\nThe regressions showed age-related decreases and increases in activations for internally and externally driven processes, respectively (Table  . Figure   shows activations in each contrast overlaid on a T1 structural image using MRIcroN (Rorden and Brett,  ). In SS > SE, age was associated with decreased activation in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) at   p   < 0.05, corrected for family wise errors (FWE) of multiple comparisons. In pGd > pGi, age was associated with decreased activations in the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC) at   p  <0.05, corrected for FWE. For both contrasts, no brain regions showed age-associated increases in activation even when queried against larger masks derived with an uncorrected   p   < 0.05. \n  \n (A)   Age-correlated regional brain activations during internally driven processes.   (B)   Age-correlated regional brain activations during externally driven processes. \n  \nNote: Age_Pos: positive correlation with age; Age_Neg: negative correlation with age. OFC: orbitofrontal cortex; DLPFC: dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex; IFC: inferior frontal cortex; PMC: primary motor cortex; SMA: supplementary motor area; STG: superior temporal gyrus; IPL: inferior parietal lobule; G: gyrus. \n    \n Age-related changes in regional brain activations. (A)   Blue: age-related decreased activations in SS > SE;   (B)   Green: age-related decreased activations in pGd > pGi;   (C)   Red: age-related increased activations in SE > SS;   (D)   Magenta: age-related increased activations in SE > GS. Numbers at the bottom indicate the positions in the   z  -axis in the MNI coordinate. Neurological orientation: right = right. \n  \nIn SE > SS, age was associated with increased activation in bilateral primary motor cortices (PMC), postcentral gyri, supplementary motor area (SMA), bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG), and the right IFC/insula. In SE > GS, age was associated with increased activation in bilateral PMC, the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and the left IFC/insula. Likewise, for both SE > SS and SE > GS, no brain regions showed age-associated decreases in activation even when queried against larger masks derived with an uncorrected   p   < 0.05. \n\nWe extracted the effect sizes of activation for each contrast to correlate with age. The effect size of SS > SE correlates inversely with age in the left OFC (  r   = \u22120.3274,   p   = 0.0007) and DLPFC (  r   = \u22120.3094,   p   = 0.0015). Figure   highlights the correlation for the left OFC of SS > SE. The effect size of pGd > pGi also correlates inversely with age in the left IFC (  r   = \u22120.2216,   p   = 0.0327, Figure  ). Similarly, the effect sizes of all SE > SS regions (  r  MEAN = 0.3933,   p  MEAN = 0.0000) and SE > GS regions (  r  MEAN = 0.3602,   p  MEAN = 0.0001) correlate positively with age. Figure   highlights the correlation of the right PMC in SE > SS (  r   = 0.4240,   p   = 0.0000), and Figure   of the right IPL in SE > GS (  r   = 0.3665,   p   = 0.0001). \n  \n Linear correlation between effect sizes of regional brain activations and age.   Regional brain activations of internally driven processes (  A  : SS > SE; and   B  : pGd > pGi) were negatively correlated with age. Regional brain activations of externally driven processes (  C  : SE > SS; and   D  : SE > GS) were positively correlated with age. L: left; R: right: OFC: orbital frontal cortex; IFC: inferior frontal cortex; PMC: primary motor cortex; IPL: inferior parietal lobule. \n  \nTo take into account variation in behavioral performance, in a second analysis we included both age and SSRT as regressors. The patterns of age-related activations were very similar to those of the first analysis with age as the only regressor. In particular, SS > SE revealed age-related decreases in left OFC (  x   = \u221242,   y   = 41,   z   = \u221211,   Z   = 3.84,   p  = 0.006, cluster size = 16 voxels) and DLPFC (  x   = \u221227,   y   = 20,   z   = \u221246,   Z   = 3.60,   p  = 0.014, cluster size = 53 voxels) activation; pGd > pGi was associated with age-related decreases in left IFC (  x   = \u221245,   y   = 23,   z   = 19,   Z   = 2.96,   p  = 0.088, cluster size = 21 voxels) activation. SE > SS showed age-related increases in right PMC (  x   = 48,   y   = \u22127,   z   = 40,   Z   = 6.02,   p  = 0.000, cluster size = 163 voxels), left PMC/postcentral gyri/SMA (  x   = \u221254,   y   = \u221210,   z   = 46,   Z   = 5.81,   p  = 0.000, cluster size = 5847 voxels), right STG (  x   = 54,   y   = \u221213,   z   = 16,   Z   = 5.20,   p  = 0.001, cluster size = 49 voxels), and right IFC/insula (  x   = 57,   y   = 2,   z   = 13,   Z   = 4.51,   p  = 0.013, cluster size = 476 voxels) activation; SE > GS showed age-related increases in bilateral PMC (left:   x   = \u221248,   y   = \u221216,   z   = 43,   Z   = 5.41,   p  = 0.000, cluster size = 783 voxels; right:   x   = 42,   y   = \u221210,   z   = 40,   Z   = 5.31,   p  = 0.000, cluster size = 174 voxels), right IPL (  x   = 39,   y   = \u221255,   z   = 34,   Z   = 4.41,   p  = 0.019, cluster size = 1737 voxels), and left IFC/insula (  x   = \u221254,   y   = \u221246,   z   = 4,   Z   = 4.03,   p  = 0.080, cluster size = 1052 voxels) activation. \n\nTo further investigate the influence of performance on age-related activations, we compared 32 younger (27.3 \u00b1 4.5 years) and 13 older (57.1 \u00b1 6.0 years) adults matched in SSRT (young: 229 \u00b1 13 ms; old: 238 \u00b1 23 ms,   t   = 1.671,   p   = 0.102) for each of the four contrasts using two-sample   t   tests. The results showed that, when queried against a mask of SS > SE at   p   < 0.001, uncorrected, a cluster in the left OFC (  x   = \u221248,   y   = 41,   z   = \u22125,   Z   = 3.72,   p  = 0.024, cluster size = 73 voxels) showed less activation and no brain regions increased in activation in the older as compared to younger adults. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current findings support the hypothesis that age is associated with decreased and increased cerebral activations each during internally and externally driven processes. This unique pattern of age-related changes in regional brain activations is observed whether variation in behavioral performance is taken into account or not. \n\nBehaviorally, age is associated with increased goRT and SSRT, consistent with previous research (Bedard et al.,  ; Rush et al.,  ; Gamboz et al.,  ). While increased goRT may reflect declined speed in information processing (Park et al.,  ; Kray et al.,  ; Buckner,  ; Li et al.,  ; Hammerer et al.,  ) or a more conservative strategy (Reuter-Lorenz and Lustig,  ; Reuter-Lorenz and Cappell,  ), increased SSRT suggests age-related changes in cognitive functioning. A recent overview indicated that age-associated deficits in executive functions did not appear to go beyond the variance accounted for by speed-of-processing and working memory, except in aspects of cognitive control that required divided attention (Verhaeghen,  ). The SST demanded participants to attend to both the go and stop signals so that they could respond quickly and be able to withhold this response when the need arose. This dual requirement may thus elicit age-related changes in response inhibition, a function central to cognitive control. Altogether, these behavioral findings provide evidence validating the use of the SST in studying age-related changes in cerebral activations. \n\nActivations of the left OFC and DLPFC in SS as compared to SE trials, a contrast involving attentional and inhibitory control (Li et al.,  ), were inversely correlated with age. This finding is consistent with a recent study that also showed a negative correlation between age and prefrontal activations during inhibitory control in the SST, in a younger population (Cohen et al.,  ). Activations of the IFC during post-go speeding as compared to post-go slowing trials also were inversely correlated with age. Conversely, activations in many areas, including the bilateral IFC, PMC, postcentral gyri, and superior temporal gyri (STG), in SE as compared to SS or in SE as compared to GS trials were positively correlated with age. Further, no brain regions showed a positive correlation with age during SS > SE or post-go speeding > post-go slowing, or a negative correlation with age during SE > SS or SE > GS. These results support the hypothesis that age is related to decreased regional activations during internally driven processes and increased activations during externally driven processes. \n\nThis differential pattern of regional activations appears to be consistent with the top-down and bottom-up attention cortical circuits as proposed by Corbetta and Shulman ( ). These results are also in accord with the cortical networks of endogenous and exogenous control during saccadic eye movements. Specifically, Mort et al. ( ) reported predominantly frontal and parietal activations, respectively, each during voluntary (internally driven) and reflexive (externally driven) saccades. Thus, age-related decreases of activation in the dorsal frontal areas and increases of activation in the ventral frontal, temporal, and occipital visual cortices are consistent with this functional dichotomy of cortical systems. \n\nIn addition, these results are in line with the pattern of regional brain activations associated with dual mechanisms of control, as proposed by Braver and colleagues (Braver et al.,  ). Proactive control maintains goal-related information before target appearance and reactive control operates at a later stage for conflict detection and resolution. Using a continuous performance task, Braver et al. ( ) reported age-related decreases of sustained activity in the lateral PFC and increases of transient activity in the same prefrontal as well as posterior parietal regions. It was suggested that decreased and increased cortical activation reflect, respectively, inferiority of proactive control and greater reliance on reactive control in older adults (Paxton et al.,  ; Braver et al.,  ; Jimura and Braver,  ). \n\nIn an electrophysiological study of continuous performance task, Hammerer et al. ( ) reported a greater P3 response to cue than non-cue stimulus in younger adults but a greater P3 response to non-cue than cue stimulus in older adults. Their finding suggested that younger adults allocate attention to the more frequent cue stimuli while older adults are more attracted by the infrequent and unexpected stimuli. These results are consistent with our findings of age-related decreased activation in attentional regions during internally driven processes, and age-related increased activation in motor-sensory related areas during externally driven processes. \n\nMost behavioral tasks engage both internally and externally driven processes (Corbetta and Shulman,  ). For example, behavioral paradigms that are widely used to study cognitive control\u2014Stroop, go/no-go, and flanker tasks\u2014involve both intentional suppression of a prepotent response (internally driven) and processing of odd-ball effects (externally driven) during incongruent, as compared to congruent, trials. Thus, by comparing incongruent and congruent trials in the Stroop task, previous studies have reported age-related decreases in bilateral DLPFC (Milham et al.,  ) and left IFC (Langenecker et al.,  ) activations, as well as age-related increases in visual area activations (Milham et al.,  ). Similarly, in a go/no-go task, Nielson et al. ( ) observed age-related decreased activation of the right IFC and fusiform gyrus along with increased activation of the left DLPFC and IFC during \u201cno-go\u201d responses as compared to resting (see also Langenecker and Nielson,  ). In a flanker task, by comparing incongruent and congruent trials, Colcombe et al. ( ) reported age-related increases in activation of bilateral DLPFC, left IFC, and anterior cingulate cortex/SMA, as well as decreases in activation of the left MFG. Likewise, during verb generation, Persson et al. ( ) found age-related decreases in the left IFC and increases in right IFC activation. In recalling a six letter vs. one letter stimulus, which differed both in perceptual processing and memory load, older adults showed less activation in the right rostral PFC and IFC but greater activation in the right DLPFC (Rypma et al.,  ). Sometimes, the very same brain region increased in activation in one study but decreased in others for identical contrasts. For instance, in comparing incongruent with congruent trials, Milham et al. ( ) reported age-related decreases while Colcombe et al. ( ) reported increases in bilateral DLPFC activation. We speculate that this discrepancy reflected the different extents to which internally vs. externally driven processes were involved across studies. \n\nPast research attributed decreased cerebral activations along with impaired behavioral performance to aging of the brain, and posited compensatory mechanisms to account for age-related increases in regional brain activations (Park et al.,  ; Buckner,  ; Park and Reuter-Lorenz,  ). The Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH) theorized that overactivation in older adults reflects a compensatory mechanism: as task difficulty increases, older adults fail to continue to increase activation (Reuter-Lorenz and Cappell,  ). In addition to task difficulty, the interpretation of compensatory mechanisms should take into account behavioral performance, as suggested by Nagel and colleagues (Nagel et al.,  ,  ). Using a working memory task with different levels of memory load, Nagel et al. reported different patterns of dose-response functions between high and low performers in young as well as in old adults. As memory load increased, young-high performers showed a positive linear increment of activation, and old-low performers showed a quadratic pattern of activation, while young-low performers and old-high performers showed a similar, mixed pattern. The fact that old-high performers presented a youth-like pattern suggested a compensatory mechanism, especially in low load conditions, consistent with the CRUNCH. On the other hand, compared to old-high performers, old-low performers did not sufficiently recruit task-related brain regions even in low load conditions, suggesting a cognitive/neurological impairment associated with age. Nagel and colleagues' research highlighted the impact of heterogeneous neural processes associated with aging on the interpretation of age-related differential patterns and emphasized the integration of imaging results and behavioral performance. \n\nWith the reminder from Nagel and colleagues' work, we regressed BOLD contrasts against age both with and without SSRT as a covariate and found that, when behavioral performance was accounted for, age was associated with similar patterns of cerebral activations. Moreover, compared to a group of younger adults who were matched in SSRT, older adults showed similar decreases in OFC activations during SS as compared to SE trials. In no case were increased activations observed in older as compared to younger adults. While these results support decreased cerebral activations during an internally driven process, they do not rule out the possibility of a compensatory mechanism in aging; older adults' performance may have reached ceiling and thus failed to demonstrate compensatory increases in activations (Park et al.,  ; Buckner,  ; Nagel et al.,  ,  ; Park and Reuter-Lorenz,  ). \n\nOn the other hand, the current results of increased activation during the externally driven process in SE > SS and SE > GS could reflect a compensatory mechanism in older adults, because post-error slowing, as an index of error processing, did not vary with age. However, we did not observe increased bilateral activation or reduction of hemispheric asymmetry in activation, in association with age (Cabeza,  ). The current results also did not show accompanying age-related decreases in activations of other brain regions (e.g., Grady et al.,  ) or age-related increases in activations of non-task areas, a dedifferentiation or over-recruitment, to compensate for performance (Park et al.,  ), even when the results were examined at   p   = 0.05 uncorrected. Taken together, evidence is mixed regarding the compatibility of the current results with compensatory processes in aging. \n\nA limitation in this study is the small number of participants in the highest age range. Only seven out of 103 people were over 60 years of age. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the pattern of age-related effects will follow the same trend for an elderly population. \n\nIn conclusion, the current study investigated how age influences regional brain activations in a SST. We observed age-related decreases in cerebral activations during internally driven processes and increases in activations during externally driven processes, in support of a functional dichotomy of age-related changes in cerebral activities during cognitive challenges. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nAge\tAll\tMen\tWomen\n18\u201319\t2\t1\t1\n20\u201329\t57\t24\t33\n30\u201339\t24\t15\t9\n40\u201349\t5\t3\t2\n50\u201359\t8\t5\t3\n60\u201369\t6\t4\t2\n\u226570\t1\t0\t1\n### Caption\nThe number of subjects broken down by age and gender.\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: T2\n### Label: Table 2\nUnnamed: 0\tRange\tMean \u00b1 Standard deviation\nMedian goRT\t315\u2013784 ms\t589 \u00b1 101 ms\nMean goRT\t335\u2013782 ms\t595 \u00b1 94 ms\nSSRT\t98\u2013287 ms\t204 \u00b1 34 ms\nGS%\t84.5\u2013100%\t95.8 \u00b1 3.6%\nSS%\t44.9\u201357.8%\t50.5 \u00b1 2.3%\nFP effect (effect size)\t\u22120.96\u22126.04\t2.38 \u00b1 1.64\nPES (effect size)\t\u22122.41\u22127.59\t2.04 \u00b1 1.71\n### Caption\nBehavioral performance on the stop signal task (n = 103).\n### Footer\nNote: goRT: go trial reaction time; SSRT: stop signal reaction time; GS%: percentage of go success trials in all go trials; SS%: percentage of stop success trials in all stop trials; FP: fore-period; PES: post-error slowing.

Traditionally, this paradigm has been applied using either high temporal resolution (EEG) or high spatial resolution (fMRI, PET). However, used separately, these techniques cannot provide information on both the location and time course of particular neural processes. The goal of this study was to investigate the neural correlates of auditory processes with a fine spatio-temporal resolution. A simultaneous auditory evoked potentials (AEP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique (AEP-fMRI), together with an odd-ball paradigm, were used. \n\n\n## Material/Methods \n  \nSix healthy volunteers, aged 20\u201335 years, participated in an odd-ball simultaneous AEP-fMRI experiment. AEP in response to acoustic stimuli were used to model bioelectric intracerebral generators, and electrophysiological results were integrated with fMRI data. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nfMRI activation evoked by standard stimuli was found to occur mainly in the primary auditory cortex. Activity in these regions overlapped with intracerebral bioelectric sources (dipoles) of the N1 component. Dipoles of the N1/P2 complex in response to standard stimuli were also found in the auditory pathway between the thalamus and the auditory cortex. Deviant stimuli induced fMRI activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, and parietal lobes. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe present study showed that neural processes evoked by standard stimuli occur predominantly in subcortical and cortical structures of the auditory pathway. Deviants activate areas non-specific for auditory information processing. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nAn ability to select relevant auditory stimuli from our surroundings is an important aspect of human behavior. One commonly used experimental scheme for studying neural correlates of auditory processing is the odd-ball paradigm [ ] in which a target acoustic stimulus (the deviant) is presented among frequent stimuli (the standard). The task is to respond (by pressing a button or counting silently) to the deviants and ignore the standard sounds [ ]. An odd-ball paradigm is designed to involve both perception and processing of auditory information at higher levels [ , ]. \n\nThe neural basis of auditory information processing has been investigated using various methods [ \u2013 ]. One of these techniques is auditory evoked potentials (AEP), in which cortical responses to acoustic stimuli are registered [ \u2013 ]. It is well documented [ ] that the morphology of AEP elicited by a standard sound is different from the cortical response to a deviant. Accordingly, a standard stimulus (e.g. a pure tone) induces N1 and P2 components, which together constitute an N1/P2 complex. In response to deviants, N2 and P3 potentials are also observed, as well as N1 and P2 components [ , ]. Such differences in the morphology of AEP between deviant and standard stimuli result from the involvement of different structures in the processing of each stimulus type [ ]. \n\nCertain components of AEP are considered to be markers of subsequent processes engaged during the processing of a stimulus (see [ , ] for a review). Early components of AEP such as N1, P2, or N1/P2 complex are considered exogenous and reflect neural processes associated mainly with sensory and physical properties of the stimuli, or detection of nonspecific physical or semantic changes in the hearing environment [ ]. In contrast, later endogenous components are thought to be markers of cognitive processes allocated to the task [ ]. According to recent theories, the P3 potential reflects attention and working memory-dependent processes of stimulus categorization [ \u2013 ], whereas the N2 component is related to the process of matching the incoming stimulus to its internally generated contextual pattern, which occurs before the categorization [ , ]. In summary, odd-ball paradigms permit electrophysiological techniques to be used in a way that can separate the different neural processes associated with standard and deviant stimuli. \n\nAEP can provide information about the timing of cortical activations at different stages of auditory processing [ , , , ]. AEP allow insight into rapid neural processes because the technique has high temporal resolution (in the range of milliseconds) due to the way in which the electrical field changes are measured [ ]. During recording of AEP, rapid changes in the electrical field, induced by neural activity, propagate immediately from the involved brain area to the surface of the head. Therefore, in an odd-ball paradigm the processing underlying each type of stimulus (standard or deviant) is immediately reflected in the AEP [ , ]. \n\nAlthough EEG methods, including AEP, have high temporal resolution, their spatial resolution is limited to a few centimeters [ ]. This rather poor resolution comes from distortion of the electrical field while conducting through the skull and other brain tissues. So while AEP reflect the bioelectrical activity of particular brain structures, they are widely distributed on the surface of the head [ ]. Consequently, EEG techniques cannot provide precise information on the location of particular stages of auditory processing. \n\nTo improve EEG spatial resolution it is necessary to sample the topographical distribution of particular AEP components at a sufficient density. For this purpose, a large number of electrodes \u2013 32, 64, 128, or even 256 channels \u2013 have been used [ , ], enabling precise location of AEP bioelectrical sources. However, existence of an inverse problem makes the determination of AEP generators difficult because a given surface map may have been produced by many possible source distributions. In other words, the inverse problem has no unique solution. \n\nIntracerebral sources of particular AEP components can in theory be determined using various algorithms such as equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) or distributed source models [ , ]. A major limitation of the ECD technique is the requirement to make assumptions about the neural sources. ECDs usually assume that the underlying neuronal sources are focal. Such a supposition requires a thorough knowledge of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, and it is only reasonable for motor or sensory processes that have a well-defined representation in the brain. However, for widely distributed cognitive processes, source modeling becomes very complicated [ ]. \n\nDistributed source models (e.g. LORETA and sLORETA) divide the source space into a grid containing many dipoles. The inverse problem is to obtain the dipole moments for each grid node. As the number of unknown dipole moments is much greater than the number of electrodes, the inverse solution is highly underdetermined. In this technique, assumptions about the modeled EEG sources are not necessary [ , ], but the resulting distributions can be difficult to interpret because they only generate a blurred image of the neuronal source distribution. Neural sources modeling is constantly being developed to provide more precise locations of the EEG generators. However, all these techniques are very sensitive to signal distortion, and when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, source modeling is susceptible to errors [ ]. \n\nIn view of the limitations of EEG methods in determining the source of brain activity, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to study neural processes evoked by standard and deviant acoustic stimuli (event-related fMRI) [ \u2013 ]. This technique is based on blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast, discovered by Ogawa [ ], and is used to map neural activity in the brain with a high spatial resolution (a few millimeters). The technique relies on cerebral blood flow and neuronal activation being coupled. When a brain area is engaged in a task, blood flow to that region increases. Therefore, an fMRI study using an auditory odd-ball paradigm allows recording the BOLD signal from areas activated during the processing of standard and deviant stimuli. However, a limitation of the fMRI technique is its low temporal resolution. The resulting fMRI images show all brain structures activated during a whole cycle of hemodynamic response, which takes several seconds [ ]. During this time many different neural processes may occur and all of them are reflected in the fMRI images. \n\nTaking all the above facts into consideration, investigation of rapid and complex neural processes is a methodological challenge. One approach to solving this problem is to combine 2 techniques, one with high spatial resolution and the other with high temporal resolution. For example, AEP recording can be performed simultaneously with MEG or PET [ , ], but most studies use a combination of AEP and fMRI methods. Combination of these techniques creates a powerful tool for studying processing at different levels of the auditory pathway [ , ]. \n\nDuring the past several years, high spatio-temporal resolution methods have been used to investigate the neural processes engaged in an auditory odd-ball task. However, most of these studies focus on the brain activities related to deviants [ , , , ]. Only a few authors have attempted to describe processes and structures involved in both deviant and standard stimuli analysis [ , ], which appears to be a promising approach to investigate the processes occurring at different stages of the auditory system. \n\nHere, we present the preliminary results of studies on neural correlates of stimulus processing in the auditory odd-ball paradigm. Simultaneous AEP-fMRI technique was applied to measure deviant and standard induced brain activity, with good spatial and temporal resolution. Both AEP-fMRI method and an experimental procedure may be used to investigate auditory information processing at different levels of the central nervous system in clinical samples. \n\n\n## Material and Methods \n  \nThe AEP-fMRI study was conducted at the Bioimaging Research Center of the Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing in Warsaw, Poland. \n\n### Subjects \n  \nSix young adults (5 male and 1 female), aged 22 to 35 years, participated in the study. All subjects had normal hearing levels in both ears (below 20 dB HL for 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 4000, and 8000 Hz), relatively good health, were right-handed (  Edinburgh Handedness Inventory  [ ]) and reported no history of neuropsychiatric disorders. \n\nGeneral exclusion criteria for AEP-fMRI study are ferromagnetic objects in the body and claustrophobia. During simultaneous registration of AEP and fMRI, signal subjects are asked to lie down in the same position in a limited space for about half an hour. For this reason, the AEP-fMRI procedure is not recommended for pregnant women, very young children, persons with hyperactivity, or those more prone to fatigue (e.g. elderly people and post-stroke patients). \n\nEach subject provided written informed consent prior to the study. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee. \n\n\n### Subject preparation and data acquisition procedure \n  \nThe main AEP- fMRI study was preceded by certain preparatory activities such as the attachment of electrodes (mounted in a special cap) to the subject\u2019s head, application of a gel to the electrodes to improve the conduction of electrical impulses, measurement of impedance of the electrodes, and, finally, placing the subject in an MRI scanner. The preparation procedure took about 30 min. \n\nThe AEP-fMRI study consisted of 2 parts: acquisition of anatomical images of the whole brain and simultaneous registration of AEP and fMRI signal in response to presented auditory stimuli. The entire AEP-fMRI study (including preparation procedure) lasted about 30 min. After completing the AEP-fMRI study, each subject had a short (15\u201320 min) time to rest. Then, AEP registration was performed outside an MR scanner room which took approximately 10 min. The entire procedure took 1.5 h. \n\n\n### Experimental paradigm \n  \nA modified auditory odd-ball paradigm was used to acquire AEP inside an MRI scanner ( ). Pure sinusoidal 100-ms tones of different frequency (1 and 2 kHz) were delivered binaurally via electrostatic headphones at 80 dBA hearing level. The stimuli were presented in 2 alternating 30-s blocks: 1) a standard and 2) an odd-ball block. There were 10 repetitions of each block. The standard block consisted of ten 1-kHz tones, whereas the odd-ball block consisted of three 2-kHz tones (deviants) and seven 1-kHz tones (standards) presented in pseudo-random order. During the standard block, subjects were asked to listen attentively to the applied stimuli. The odd-ball task was to silently count the deviants and ignore the more frequently presented standards. During a whole run on a single subject, 30 AEP to deviants and 170 responses to standard stimuli were registered. \n\nfMRI data were collected according to the SPARSE acquisition schema, which allows stimuli to be presented in the absence of scanner noise [ ].   shows the stimulus scheme, in which every 6-s interval within the standard or oddball block contained 2 tones, 2 s of silence, and then a whole brain scan occupying another 2 s. \n\nAEP acquired in the magnet were compared with the electrophysiological responses obtained outside the MRI scanner. The paradigm used outside the scanner was virtually the same as that applied during the combined AEP-fMRI study, the only difference being the lack of scanning periods. The studies inside and outside the scanner were performed in a single session and were counterbalanced across subjects. \n\n\n### EEG data acquisition and signal preparation \n  \nAEP were registered from 62 unipolar electrodes placed on the subject\u2019s head according to the 10/10 International Standard System [ ] using a MagLink (Neuroscan) EEG recording system from Compumedics, which is designed to work in strong magnetic fields. Two pairs of bipolar electrodes were used to monitor vertical eye movements (VEOG) and the electrocardiogram (ECG). The ground electrode was placed between FCz and Fz, and the reference electrode for all unipolar electrodes was located between CPz and Cz. The impedance of each channel was kept below 10 k\u03a9. \n\nThe electrophysiological data acquired during the simultaneous AEP-fMRI recordings (outside and inside the MRI scanner) were analyzed according to the following procedure. Large (thousands of \u03bcV) gradient artifacts (GAs) were first removed from the EEG signal (GAs are induced in EEG signals by magnetic field changes in the gradient coils of the MRI scanner [ ]). GAs did not interfere directly with AEP recorded during the silent intervals; however, their removal helps visualize the EEG signal and thereby improves signal processing. A high (10 kHz) sampling rate was used to remove GAs from the EEG data by subtraction of the averaged template. A corresponding template for each gradient coil activation was based on 17 artifacts surrounding the currently processed 2-s block. \n\nBalistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts were also removed from the EEG signal. BCG artifacts are generated by heart beats, which change the position of EEG electrodes and wires on the subject\u2019s head and body and induce spurious voltages [ ]. A modified procedure [ , ] was performed to reduce BCG artifacts. Each well-defined QRS complex was manually marked at maximum amplitude of the R peak and then used to create a separate average BCG artifact template for each channel. These templates were used to calculate a singular value decomposition (SVD) matrix, which formed the basis of BCG component reduction. \n\nArtifacts induced by eye movements were also removed using the same procedure as BCG artifact reduction. After the removal of artifacts, standard AEP analysis was conducted. The recording window consisted of a 100-ms pre-stimulus period and a 750-ms post-stimulus time. Baseline correction and band-pass filtering (1\u201330 Hz, 12 dB/octave, no phase shift) of each epoch was performed and the signal was averaged. \n\n\n### Study design and fMRI data analysis \n  \nThe fMRI study was performed using a high-field (3T) Siemens Magnetom Trio Tim MRI scanner. The scanning function had the following parameters: T2 single-shot echo-planar imaging, EPI sequence, voxel size =3\u00d73\u00d74 mm, 32 axial slices, repetition time (TR) =6000 ms, echo time (TE) =30 ms, acquisition time (TA) =10 min. \n\nFor structural imaging, a T1 inversion recovery sequence with the following parameters was used: voxel size =0.9\u00d70.9\u00d70.9 mm, 208 sagittal slices, repetition time (TR)=1900 ms, echo time (TE)=2.21 ms, inversion time (TI)=900 ms, and acquisition time (TA)=5 min. \n\nfMRI data obtained during simultaneous fMRI-EEG signal recording was analyzed in the SPM8 toolbox for MATLAB. Preprocessing of the brain images included movement correction (first volume was used as the reference image), co-registration with the subject\u2019s structural brain image, and smoothing using a Gaussian spatial filter with voxel FWHM of 6 mm. A general linear model (GLM) and a high-pass filter with a period of 128 s were used to analyze BOLD signal changes. Additionally, hemodynamic response function (HRF) modeling was applied. \n\nFor each subject, the standard   vs.   deviant and deviant   vs.   standard contrasts were calculated (the first-level analysis). Then, a 1-sample   t   test (  p  -value threshold \u22640.01) was applied for group data analysis (the second-level analysis). \n\n\n### 3D spatial current distribution modeling and intracerebral AEP source analysis \n  \nA brain-mapping technique was used to model the spatial distribution of AEP voltages [ ]. Modeling was done on the bioelectric responses recorded from all electrodes during sessions outside and inside the MRI scanner. Three-dimensional distribution maps of particular AEP components were calculated and projected onto virtual and real head models (the latter created from MRI images of the subjects). \n\nThe 3D voltage distribution maps and AEP recorded from all 62 electrodes during the combined AEP-fMRI study were used to localize the intracerebral sources (dipoles) of evoked responses. Two different methods \u2013 rotating and moving dipoles \u2013 were used to calculate AEP generators [ ]. Dipoles of subsequent components visible in the AEP to standard and deviant stimuli were modeled separately. To specify the AEP generators, time intervals during which the mean global field power (MGFP) of the modeled components reached maximum values were used. To fix the number of sources to be modeled, independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to signals in each of the predefined time ranges. The number of ICA components that explained the majority of the AEP variance was assumed to be the number of intracerebral sources for each modeled component. \n\nCalculation of spatial distribution and intracerebral sources (generators) of AEP was done using Curry 6.0 software (Compumedics Neuroscan, Charlotte, NC). \n\n\n### Combining AEP and fMRI results \n  \nThe same Curry 6.0 software was also used to combine the electrophysiological and fMRI data. The dipoles of particular AEP components uncovered by the intracerebral source analysis were combined with fMRI hemodynamic activation data. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe results of AEP and fMRI analyses were integrated to provide data with high spatial and temporal resolution. \n\n### Brain response to deviant stimuli \n  \n shows the average AEP to deviants averaged across all subjects. It presents electrode responses recorded during simultaneous AEP-fMRI (grey lines) compared to cortical responses obtained outside the MRI scanner (black lines). Outside the scanner, N1, P2, and P3 (P300) components could be observed in all study subjects. However, inside the magnet these components had smaller amplitudes and, as   shows, could be clearly distinguished, predominantly at central electrodes. Mean amplitudes and latencies of individual response components for deviant tones measured at C3 electrode are shown in  . \n\nDeviant stimuli activated bilateral insula and inferior parietal lobule as well as left anterior cingulate gyrus ( ). \n\n\n### Brain response to standard stimuli \n  \nAEP to standard stimuli inside and outside the MRI scanner had a similar morphology at all electrodes ( ). Specifically, N1 and P2 components were observed in both conditions. Latencies of the components were comparable, but the amplitudes were higher outside the magnet than inside ( ). Moreover, distribution of N1 and P2 amplitudes, acquired during the simultaneous AEP-fMRI study, matched the topography of the corresponding components recorded outside the MRI scanner. Topographies of the N1 and P2 amplitudes registered inside and outside the MRI scanner were similar to those observed outside the MRI scanner (  shows the distribution of amplitudes laid out on the virtual head model). \n\nThe AEP of individual subjects recorded inside the MRI scanner in response to standard stimuli were used to model the dipoles (intracerebral sources of bioelectric activity) of the N1 component. The procedure began from an AEP amplitude distribution plotted on the surface of a real head model created from an MRI image of the subject.   presents an example of an N1 component amplitude distribution mapped onto a model of a subject\u2019s head. The sources of the N1 component were calculated using the method of rotating dipoles [ ]. This technique reduces the location of intracerebral sources to fixed points inside the brain space, but allows for changes in orientation and strength of the dipoles. Based on the results of ICA analysis, 2 symmetrical sources of N1 were modeled. The dipoles were calculated within the latency range in which the MGFP of the N1 component reaches its maximal value.   shows the results of such analysis, revealing 2 separate N1 generators located near the primary auditory cortex. \n\nThe intracerebral sources of the N1/P2 complex evoked by standard stimuli were also modeled using the moving dipoles technique. All parameters of the dipoles, including locations, were allowed to vary [ ]. The moving dipoles method confirmed the results of the rotating dipoles technique (ie, 2 symmetrical dipoles of the N1/P2 complex were modeled). The N1/P2 generators (calculated at times within the N1/P2 latency of 50\u2013120 ms) were located in brain regions where subsequent stages of information processing take place. These regions are part of the auditory pathway between the thalamus and auditory cortex ( ). It is noteworthy that fMRI data also indicates activation of the primary auditory cortex in response to standard stimuli ( ). \n\nTo obtain data displaying both good temporal and spatial resolution, results of the moving dipole analysis of the N1/P2 complex were integrated with the fMRI outcomes. The N1/P2 generators were superimposed on the MRI images and then compared with the fMRI activations in response to the same stimuli. In most subjects (5 out of 6) the N1/P2 dipoles, modeled at a time when each component\u2019s amplitude was at a maximum, appeared at locations close to the primary auditory cortex ( ). Similar as previously, fMRI data showed the same brain regions to be active ( ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe aim of the present AEP-fMRI study was to define, both in time and space, the neural processes and areas of the brain involved in processing standard and deviant stimuli. We used an auditory odd-ball paradigm, and AEP evoked by 1000 Hz (standard) and 2000 Hz (deviant) tones were recorded simultaneously with hemodynamic (fMRI) responses triggered by these 2 stimulus types. \n\nWe obtained bioelectrical (AEP) responses to standard and deviant stimuli, and the morphology of individual AEP components and their parameters (amplitude and latency) to both these stimulus types were compared to AEP evoked by the same stimuli outside the MRI scanner ( ,  ). AEP components induced inside the scanner had smaller amplitudes compared to those outside the scanner room. Others have also found similar reductions [ \u2013 ], and one possibility is that this might be due to constant activation of the auditory cortex from noise generated by the MRI gradient coils (approximately 99 dB SPL) [ ]. \n\nOur AEP-fMRI study showed that electroencephalographic responses to standard stimuli were localized to the primary auditory cortex ( ,   and  ). These results are in accordance with reports on neural processes evoked by standard stimuli using both fMRI [ , ] and simultaneous AEP-fMRI [ , , ]. In our studies, the primary auditory cortex was stimulated by frequent acoustic stimuli presented in an odd-ball paradigm. In contrast to standard stimuli, deviants activated structures that are not part of the central auditory system (ie, the inferior parietal lobule, anterior cingulate gyrus, and insula ( ). Similar brain activations have been found in previous studies using experimental paradigms that involved cognitive or emotional processes [ , ]. Such studies used AEP, fMRI, and either simultaneous AEP-fMRI or VEP-fMRI to determine P3 generators [ , \u2013 ]. Previous work has also indicated that the inferior parietal lobule is engaged in tasks requiring decision making [ ] and has been considered to play important role in visuo-motor integration and spatial perception [ ], emotion recognition [ ], language [ ], and mathematical reasoning [ ]. \n\nIn response to standard stimuli, our study was able to locate the intracerebral bioelectrical generators of individual components of the AEP. We used the moving and rotating dipoles techniques, and both methods provide results corresponded with the fMRI findings. Obtained locations of the intracerebral bioelectrical generators were also congruent with the results reported by other authors [ , ]. However, the deviant tones work was a different matter \u2013 when we attempted to determine the generators of the N1, P2 or N1/P2 complex, and P3 using such stimuli, and combine them with fMRI and MRI data, locations of the modeled dipoles did not completely overlap with fMRI activations. This effect might result from a low signal-to-noise ratio in AEP in responses to deviants. A minimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the EEG signals used for modeling the intracerebral bioelectrical generator to achieve reliable results should be <4 [ , ]. In our study, SNR for AEP to deviants was below this value, so in this case we decided to not interpret the results of modeling of AEP generators. Low SNR in EEG signal recorded in the magnet in responses to deviants might be caused by specific experimental conditions during simultaneous AEP and fMRI data registration; a high magnetic field induces specific artifacts in EEG signal leads to decreasing SNR ratio [ ]. Moreover, the relatively small number of deviants (n=30) applied in our odd-ball paradigm most likely contributed to a low SNR value. Presentation of more deviant stimuli would, however, significantly extend the testing time inside an MRI scanner, leading to subject fatigue and decreasing motivation to perform the auditory task [ ]. A number of infrequent stimuli used in our odd-ball paradigm theoretically should enable modeling AEP generators, but, unfortunately, it turned out to be insufficient. Therefore, we suggest an increased number of deviants and perhaps some modifications of an experimental protocol in an AEP-fMRI procedure. Such improvements would allow for more pronounced brain (bioelectrical and hemodynamic) responses and a relatively short testing time. In this case, a paradigm could be suitable not only for young adults but also for children, elderly people, and clinical trials. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe presented AEP-fMRI odd-ball paradigm allows examination of the neural processes related to analysis of deviant and standard stimuli, with high spatio-temporal resolution. In responses to deviant stimuli, we found activations in the cortical regions not directly involved in the central auditory processes, whereas both low (subcortical) and high (cortical) levels of the auditory system were engaged in the standards processing. \n\nA method of simultaneous AEP and fMRI signal registrations combines fMRI\u2019s ability to precisely locate the blood dynamics in the whole brain with the electrophysiological ability to characterize rapid neural processes and to reveal pathological patterns. Therefore, our AEP-fMRI study might provide clinically useful information about the functioning of the central auditory system. \n\nBecause of the prolonged testing time inside an MRI scanner and the complexity of the procedure, we recommended the presented odd-ball paradigm for adult and relatively cooperative patients. However, this protocol, after small modifications, might also be adapted to investigate central auditory information processing in clinical trials. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: t1-medscimonit-20-35\n### Label: Table 1\nAuditory evoked potential component\tMean value of AEP parameter obtained outside MRI scanner\tMean value of AEP parameter obtained outside MRI scanner\nAuditory evoked potential component\tAmplitude\tLatency\nN1\t\u22124.5 \u03bcV (\u00b11.5)\t109.8 ms (\u00b15.6)\nP2\t5.5 \u03bcV (\u00b11.2)\t186.5 ms (\u00b15.0)\nP3\t6.5 \u03bcV (\u00b12.8)\t332.4 ms (\u00b120.4)\n### Caption\nMean amplitudes and latencies of AEP to 2000 Hz deviant stimuli recorded at the C3 electrode during measurements outside the MRI scanner.\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: t2-medscimonit-20-35\n### Label: Table 2\nBrain region\tfMRI\tNumber of activated voxels\tContrast\nBrain region\tX, Y, Z (Talairach)\tNumber of activated voxels\tContrast\n\t\t\tDeviant to standard t\nInsula (left hemisphere)\t40, 12, \u22124\t441.0\t4.98\nInsula (right hemisphere)\t\u221242, 10, 2\t228.0\t4.34\nAnterior cingulate gyrus (left hemisphere)\t2, 18, 46\t409.0\t7.80\nInferior parietal lobule (left hemisphere)\t32, \u221256, 42\t607.0\t6.28\nInferior parietal lobule (right hemisphere)\t\u221236, \u221268, 48\t993.0\t8.24\nInferior parietal lobule (right hemisphere)\t\u221236, \u221268, 48\t993.0\tStandard to deviant t\nPrimary auditory cortex (left hemisphere)\t50, \u22122, 0\t979.0\t5.72\nPrimary auditory cortex (right hemisphere)\t\u221248, \u221226, 8\t819.0\t5.12\n### Caption\nResults of deviant-to-standard and standard-to-deviant fMRI contrast analysis obtained during simultaneous AEP-fMRI recording.

Tasting and digesting spicy foods containing capsaicin induce various physiological responses such as perspiration from face, salivation, and facilitation of cardiovascular activity, which are thought to be caused through viscero-visceral autonomic reflexes. However, this does not necessarily exclude the possibility of the involvement of higher-order sensory-motor integration between the M/PSG and anterior short gyrus (ASG) known as the autonomic region of the insula. To reveal a possible functional coordination between the M/PSG and ASG, we here addressed whether capsaicin increases neural activity in the ASG as well as the M/PSG using fMRI and a custom-made taste delivery system. Twenty subjects participated in this study, and three tastant solutions: capsaicin, NaCl, and artificial saliva (AS) were used. Group analyses with the regions activated by capsaicin revealed significant activations in the bilateral ASG and M/PSG. The fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals in response to capsaicin stimulation were significantly higher in ASG than in M/PSG regardless of the side. Concomitantly, capsaicin increased the fingertip temperature significantly. Although there was no significant correlation between the fingertip temperatures and BOLD signals in the ASG or M/PSG when the contrast [Capsaicin\u2013AS] or [Capsaicin\u2013NaCl] was computed, a significant correlation was found in the bilateral ASG when the contrast [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS] was computed. In contrast, there was a significant correlation in the hypothalamus regardless of the contrasts. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between M/PSG and ASG. These results indicate that capsaicin increases neural activity in the ASG as well as the M/PSG, suggesting that the neural coordination between the two cortical areas may be involved in autonomic responses to tasting spicy foods as reflected in fingertip temperature increases. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCapsaicin is the pungent ingredient of hot red pepper and has long been traditionally used as ingredient of spices, preservatives, and medicine ( ). In response to tasting and digesting spicy foods containing capsaicin, various physiological responses such as perspiration from face ( ), salivation ( ) and increases of systolic blood pressure, heart rate, body core, and surface temperatures ( ) are transiently induced. Such autonomic responses may be induced through viscero-visceral autonomic reflexes ( ). The exact neuroanatomical basis of these reflexes is not firmly established, but it is generally believed that capsaicin activates nociceptive afferents innervating the oral organs and gut, which in turn activates sympathetic nervous system, causing facilitation of cardiovascular activity as a result of viscero-visceral reflex. It is also reported that capsaicin accelerates adrenaline secretion by activating the adrenal sympathetic efferent nerve in rats ( ). However, this does not necessarily exclude the possibility of the involvement of higher-order sensory-motor integration. \n\nSince capsaicin activates the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) on primary afferent neurons ( ), capsaicin-induced autonomic reflexes might be caused by impulse activity in nociceptive afferents innervating oral mucosa and taste bud expressing TRPV1 ( ;  ;  ). In the rat insular cortex, the dysgranular region is involved in taste perception as the primary gustatory area ( ;  ), while its caudal granular region is potentially involved in visceral sensory-motor control as the primary autonomic area ( ;  ;  ). Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging and whole cell recording in rat slice preparations, we recently demonstrated that theta-band oscillatory neural coordination between the gustatory and autonomic insular cortices can be induced by activation of TRPV1 in the insular cortex ( ). Therefore, it may be possible that not only the viscero-visceral reflex but also such a neural coordination induced by TRPV1 activation is responsible for the autonomic responses to tasting and ingesting spicy foods. \n\nImmunohistochemical studies revealed that TRPV1 is expressed in epithelial cells ( ) and taste buds mainly in the circumvallate papillae ( ) of the human tongue. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in human subjects demonstrated that the tasting and swallowing of 44 \u03bcM capsaicin cause excitation in the primary gustatory area, the ventral part of the middle and posterior short gyri (M/PSG) of the insular cortex ( ), suggesting that capsaicin is perceived as hot and spicy tastes. On the other hand, the anterior short gyrus (ASG) of the insular cortex has been identified as the center for the autonomic sensory-motor integration in recent fMRI studies ( ;  ;  ). This anatomical arrangement of the gustatory and autonomic areas in the insular cortex is very similar to that of the rat, suggesting a possibility of neural coordination between M/PSG and ASG. However, it has not been investigated whether the oral administration of capsaicin at a higher concentration activates not only M/PSG but also ASG and whether such ASG activation is involved in autonomic responses in human subjects. We here demonstrate that the tasting and ingestion of 65 \u03bcM capsaicin activated ASG as well as M/PSG and a significant correlation was found between the effects size of fMRI BOLD signals in the bilateral ASG but not in M/PSG and the fingertip temperature increases. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nExperiments were performed on 20 healthy subjects (16 males and four females; aged 20\u201336 years) without any history of neuromuscular disorder or injury to their brain. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before the experiment. Ethical approval from the ethical committee of the National Institute for Physiological Sciences and the ethical committee of Osaka University were obtained before the experiment. \n\n\n### Stimulus Solution \n  \nThe following three solutions were used as tastants: artificial saliva (AS), 65 \u03bcM capsaicin, and 0.75 M NaCl dissolved in deionized water. The concentrations of capsaicin and NaCl were determined to be approximately equally intense based on psychophysiological tests ( ). NaCl solution at this concentration is widely used as a salty tastant ( ;  ), and a limited application of 1 M NaCl did not cause aversive sensation ( ). It was confirmed in all the subjects participated that 0.3 mL NaCl solution at 0.75 M did not cause aversive sensation. AS was composed of a 12.5 mM KCl and 1.25 mM NaHCO  solution similar to the ionic components of saliva ( ). All solutions were delivered at a room temperature (22\u201324\u00b0C) as any effects of temperature, which is known to be represented in the insular cortex ( ), could not have contributed to any of the effects described in our investigation. \n\n\n### Stimulus Delivery System \n  \nA custom designed taste delivery system was built to administer the liquid stimuli. The three tastants were delivered into the subject\u2019s mouth through the three tygon tubes, one ends of which were connected to the three storage bottles suspended from the ceiling and the other ends were introduced into the mouth to reach the posterior one third of the tongue after the tubes were attached to the incisor region of a rigid custom made mandibular mouthguard with dental resin bonding. The flow of the tastants was controlled by the respective solenoid valves (  Figure   ). The opening and shunting of respective solenoid valves, which were placed outside the MRI scanner room, were independently controlled by a personal computer to apply tastant solutions at a constant flow rate of 0.1 ml/s. Tastants were applied to the posterior one third of the subject\u2019s tongue based on the following three rationales: (1) Taste cells which express TRPV1 receptors are mostly located in the circumvallate papillae which are localized in the posterior one third of the human tongue ( ). (2) The strength of compound sensation of taste and burning pain evoked by capsaicin application to the posterior tongue is higher compared to the anterior tongue, regardless of concentrations of capsaicin ( ;  ). (3) None of taste neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius in rats displayed prominent excitatory responses to capsaicin application to the anterior tongue ( ). \n  \n A custom designed taste delivery system and experimental design. (A)   A schematic diagram of tastants delivery system. Tastants delivered through the three tygon tubes, the tastant flow through which was regulated by the respective solenoid valves that are controlled by a personal computer. Three solutions; artificial saliva (AS), capsaicin (Cap), and NaCl were administered at 0.1 ml/s constant flow rate.   (Ba\u2013c)   NaCl event for 3 s (blue bar) followed by AS event for 3 s (gray bar) with an interevent interval of 20 s was applied six times every 20 s (one NaCl session)   (a)  . AS event for 3 s (gray bar) followed by AS event for 3 s (gray bar) with an interevent interval of 20 s was applied six times every 20 s (one AS session)   (b)  . Capsaicin event (red bar) for 3 s followed by five 3 s AS events (gray bar) applied every 20 s was repeated two times with an interval of 138 s. A paired capsaicin block   (c)   which contains two capsaicin events was repeated 3 times every 10 min (one capsaicin session). Subjects pressed the button as soon as they felt a liquid on their tongue (bottom). \n  \n\n### Experimental Design \n  \nOne NaCl block consisted of a 3 s NaCl event and a 3 s AS event applied after a rest period of 20 s (  Figure   ), which was repeatedly applied six times every 20 s (one NaCl-session). One AS block consisted of two 3 s AS events separated by 20 s (  Figure   ), which was repeatedly applied six times every 20 s (one AS-session). A pair of capsaicin blocks, each of which contains a 3 s capsaicin event followed by five 3 s AS events repeated every 20 s, was applied with an inter-block interval of 20 s, consequently spanning about 5 min (  Figure   ). Because one MRI scan time was limitted to be about 5 min to keep the subject\u2019s attention on the task, a pair of capsaicin blocks was repeated three times every 10 min to constitute one capsaicin session. AS events after taste event application were considered as rinse events. In order to obtain a sufficient number of trials for averaging, each subjects participated in one NaCl-session, one AS-session and one capsaicin-session in the morning and in the same sessions in the afternoon on the same day. Consequently, 24 AS events, 12 NaCl events, and 12 capsaicin events were used for fMRI data analysis. \n\n\n### Subject Preparation \n  \nSubjects were instructed not to change their head positions, and to keep their eyes open to watch a fixation point in front of them. Subjects held a response button in their right hand and pressed the button as soon as possible they felt a liquid touch on their tongue (  Figure   , bottom). The button press was required to average the respective fMRI responses to a tastant which was repeatedly applied, and was used to obtain a positive control for fMRI. And also, they were asked to briefly take a swallow of solution for 1 s between fMRI data scanning so that BOLD signal was not contaminated by movement artifacts related to swallowing. Prior to MRI scan, subjects were given a description of the paradigm and were asked to participate in a training session in a laboratory. The training session served to screen subjects, familiarize subjects with the procedures and equipment used during the actual scan, and make sure that they could press the button at a probability of 90% or higher and take a swallow of solution in correct timing. \n\n\n### MRI Data Acquisition \n  \nAll images were acquired using a 3T MR scanner (Allegra; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). For functional imaging during the sessions, a T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) procedure was used to produce 3-mm-thick slices (34 in total) with a 17% gap covering the entire cerebral and cerebellar cortices [repetition time (TR) = 3000 ms; echo time (TE) = 30 ms; flip angle (FA) = 83\u00b0; the field of view (FOV) = 192 mm; 64 \u00d7 64 matrix with a pixel dimension of 3.0 \u00d7 3.0 mm]. The acquisition time (TA) was set at 2000 ms, so as to obtain a 1000-ms \u201csilent period\u201d without any magnetic-field gradient or radiofrequency pulse. This was intended to avoid contaminating motion artifacts by swallowing to the BOLD signal. In total, 960 volumes (96 volumes per run) were acquired. For anatomical imaging, high-resolution whole-brain MR images were also obtained using a T1-weighted three-dimensional (3D) magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence (TR = 2500 ms; TE = 4.38 ms; FA = 8\u00b0; FOV = 230 mm; one slab; 192 slices per slab; voxel dimensions = 0.9 mm \u00d7 0.9 mm \u00d7 1.0 mm). \n\n\n### Fingertip Temperature Measurement \n  \nBody surface temperature at the left little fingertip was measured as indicator of thermogenesis with an electronic thermometer system: thermistor (TSD202A, BIOPAC, Biopac Systems Inc., Goleta, CA, USA), skin temperature amplifier module (SKT100C, BIOPAC, Biopac Systems), data acquisition system (Powerlab, ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA) and Power Lab Chart Ver.5 (Powerlab, ADInstruments), during fMRI data acquisition. The TSD202A thermistor which can be reliably used under the condition of 3T-MR scanner (MR conditional) was attached to the skin with surgical tape. Temperature changes following application of tastants were obtained by calculating the fingertip average temperature for 15 s before and after respective sessions as controls and effects of tastants, respectively. The fingertip temperature depends on the rate of blood flow or vascular activity that is regulated by autonomic nervous system ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### fMRI Data Processing \n  \nThe first two volumes of each run were discarded due to unsteady magnetization, and the remaining 94 volumes per run (a total of 940 volumes per subject for 10 runs) were used for the analysis. Image processing and statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Parametric Mapping package (SPM8; The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) implemented in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). Functional images from each run were realigned to the mean image of all functional images to correct for motion. After the motion correction, the T1-weighted anatomical image was coregistered to the mean image, and then normalized to a standard T1 template image, which defined the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The parameters from this normalization process were then applied to each functional image. The spatially normalized EPI images were filtered using a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM) in the   x  ,   y  , and   z   axes. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Analysis \n  \nInitially, we performed a single-subject level analysis. The individual task-related activity was estimated using a general linear model ( ). The signal time-course of each subject was modeled with a boxcar function convolved with a canonical haemodynamic-response function (included in SPM8), a high pass filter (with a cut-off period of 128 s), and session effects. For each NaCl run, we included one regressor for NaCl event, one for wash event, and six regressors for six parameters (three displacements and three rotations) from rigid-body realignment stage. For each capsaicin run, we included each one regressor for capsaicin event, one for the first- to fourth-wash event, one for fifth-wash event, and six regressors from the realignment. For the AS run, we included one regressor for AS event and six regressors from the realignment. Serial autocorrelation of the fMRI time series was modeled using a first-order autoregressive model. The resulting set of voxel values for each comparison constituted a statistical parametric map of the   t   statistic [SPM {  t  }]. \n\nThe weighted sum of the parameters estimated in the individual analyses consisted of \u201ccontrast\u201d images, which were used for the group-level analyses. The contrast images obtained from each individual analysis represented the normalized increment of the fMRI signal for each subject. The contrast images of each condition were entered into a flexible factorial model for a multi-subject repeated measured analysis of variance (ANOVA) with subject (one-level for each subject) and event (three levels consisted of capsaicin, NaCl, and AS conditions) factors. To identify regions of overlapping responses to the three or two different tastes events, we performed conjunction analyses with a conjunction null hypothesis. This statistic identifies voxels that are significantly activated in each of the individual contrasts included in the conjunction ( ). Furthermore, the three types of the contrast of interest [Capsaicin\u2013AS], [Capsaicin\u2013NaCl], and [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS] were computed to reveal the regions that are selectively or more potentially activated by capsaicin. The statistical threshold was set at   p   < 0.05 with correction of the family-wise error (FWE) at the voxel level, and the resulting set of voxel values for each comparison constituted a statistical parametric map of the   t   statistic [SPM{  t  }]. \n\nWe performed ROI analysis using anatomically defined insular cortex, which was determined by using WFU pickatlas tool ( ). We extracted effect size regarding to each condition from the anatomically defined insula. Numerical data were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD. Then, we assessed statistical significance in non-pairwise and pairwise experiments using repeated-measures ANOVA with Fisher\u2019s protected least significant difference   post hoc   test (STATISTICA 10J, StatSoft), and Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between the effect sizes and the fingertip temperature changes. Statistical analysis of the fingertip temperature changes was performed with a paired   t  -test (  p   < 0.05). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Conjunction Analysis of All Taste Stimuli \n  \nTo investigate which areas are commonly activated by the three taste stimuli, we first performed a conjunction analysis between all the responses to the respective taste stimuli (  Figure    and   Table   ). Most prominently activated brain areas were bilateral anterior insula (-32, 18, 8;   T   = 12.15 and 36, 22, 4;   T   = 10.84), which were included in the largest cluster together with bilateral middle insula (-34, -6, 14;   T   = 9.85 and 38, -2, 12;   T   = 6.61,   Figure   ), left postcentral gyrus (-54, -22, 20;   T   = 11.00,   Figures   ) and left precentral gyrus (-52, 4, 10;   T   = 9.06,   Figures   ) as represented with multiple peaks. These results indicate that the insula and postcentral gyri were activated following application of tastants on subject\u2019s tongue and the precentral gyrus was activated during pressing the button, suggesting that the fMRI data revealing the activation of the insular cortices are reliable. Bilateral supplementary motor area, bilateral middle cingulate cortex, bilateral middle frontal gyrus, and bilateral cerebellum were also activated (  Table   ). These results were completely the same as the results obtained by performing a conjunction analysis of two different tastes [Capsaicin and NaCl]. \n  \n Active brain regions revealed by a conjunction analysis.

First, we performed the group analyses of the two types of comparisons; [Capsaicin\u2013AS] (  Figure    and   Table   ) and [Capsaicin\u2013NaCl] (  Figure    and   Table   ). Activated brain areas revealed by the two comparisons were the bilateral anterior insula and bilateral middle insula (  Figures    and    ). The MNI coordinates of peak voxels in anterior and middle insula were the same between the two comparisons. However, no brain areas were found to be significantly activated with the comparison [NaCl\u2013AS] (data not shown; see Discussion). \n  \n Brain areas significantly activated by the comparison [Capsaicin\u2013AS]. (A,B)   The anterior and middle insula activated by capsaicin stimuli. (  x, y, z  ) values represent Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates (mm), and the color bar represents the   T  -values. \n    \nThe peak coordinates displayed significant responses by the comparison [Capsaicin\u2013AS]. \n      \n Brain areas significantly activated by the comparison [Capsaicin\u2013NaCl]. (A,B)   The anterior and middle insula activated by capsaicin stimuli. (  x, y, z  ) values represent Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates (mm), and the color bar represents the   T  -values. \n    \nThe peak coordinates displayed significant responses by the comparison [Capsaicin\u2013NaCl]. \n    \nWe next performed the group analysis of the comparison [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS] to reveal which voxels were significantly and more potentially activated by capsaicin compared to NaCl or AS (  Figure    and   Table   ). Brain areas particularly activated by capsaicin stimuli were the bilateral anterior insula (  Figures   ), bilateral middle insula (  Figures   ), right superior medial gyrus (  Figure   ), right caudate nucleus (  Figure   ), postcentral gyrus (  Figure   ), ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) of left thalamus (  Figure   ). Highly significant activations were found in the following coordinates; [38, 20, 4] (  T   = 10.43; the right anterior insula), [\u201332, 18, 6] (  T   = 9.79; the left anterior insula), [\u201332, \u20134, 14] (  T   = 8.36; the left middle insula) and [\u20136, 16, 26] (  T   = 7.26; the left anterior cingulate cortex). These cortices are known to play crucial roles for blood pressure control, among human central autonomic network ( ). Significant activation was also observed in the hypothalamus [\u20136, \u20138, \u20132] (  T   = 5.41), which is the subcortical autonomic control center ( ). This region was included in a cluster of left thalamus (  Table   ). \n  \n Brain areas significantly activated by the comparison [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS]. (A,B)   The anterior and middle insula activated by capsaicin stimuli.   (C\u2013F)   Brain areas particularly activated by capsaicin stimuli. (  x, y, z  ) values represent Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates (mm), and the color bar represents the   T  -values. \n    \nThe peak coordinates displayed significant responses by the comparison [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS]. \n    \n\n### Differential Activation of the Short Insular Gyri Following Capsaicin Application \n  \nThe human insular cortex usually contains five major gyri: the anterior three gyri (  Figure   ) referred to as the \u201cshort\u201d gyri and the posterior two gyri termed as the \u201clong\u201d gyri ( ). The three short gyri were termed as the ASG and M/PSG. To investigate the possible differential activation in the insular cortex, ROI analysis was made at the peak coordinates (  Figure   ) in ASG and M/PSG obtained in the group analysis of the three types of the comparisons; [Capsaicin\u2013AS], [Capsaicin\u2013NaCl], and [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS]. Regardless of the types of comparisons, the effect sizes at the ASG were significantly higher than those at the M/PSG (  Figures   ), suggesting that the ASG was more potentially activated by capsaicin compared to the M/PSG. The effect sizes at the right ASG and M/PSG following capsaicin application were significantly higher compared to the left corresponding gyri (  Figures   , compare left and right red bars). \n  \n ROI analysis using anatomically defined coordinates of the insular cortex.

(B)   Two ROIs located on a right sagittal view, which were at the peak coordinates in the right ASG and M/PSG of the comparison [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS].

The mean temperature changes following application of NaCl and AS were insignificant and smaller (0.16 \u00b1 0.47 and 0.23 \u00b1 0.74\u00b0C, respectively), while the mean temperature increase following application of capsaicin was significant and larger (0.83 \u00b1 0.85\u00b0C;   Figure   ). \n  \n Correlation between fingertip temperatures and effect sizes at the peak coordinates. (A)   The fingertip temperature changes calculated by averaging for 15 s before and after AS, NaCl and capsaicin sessions. Statistical analyses were performed with a paired   t  -test. CT; control.   (B)   Correlation between the fingertip temperature increases and the effect sizes at respective peak coordinates in the left ASG   (a)   and in the left M/PSG   (b)   obtained in the group analysis of the comparison [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS].   (C)   Correlation between the fingertip temperature increases and the effect sizes at respective peak coordinates in the right ASG   (a)   and in the right M/PSG   (b)   obtained in the group analysis of the comparison [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS].   (D)   Correlation between the fingertip temperature increases and the effect sizes at the peak coordinates in the hypothalamus (\u20136, \u20138, \u20132) obtained in the group analysis of the comparison [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS].   (E)   Correlation between the fingertip temperature increases and the effect sizes at the peak coordinates in the right S1 of postcentral gyrus (64, \u201318, 24) obtained in the group analysis of the comparison [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS]. \n  \nTo investigate which areas are more closely involved in the fingertip temperature increases following capsaicin application, we performed correlation analysis between the fingertip temperature increases and the effect sizes of BOLD signals at respective peak coordinates of the three types of the comparisons; [Capsaicin\u2013AS], [Capsaicin\u2013NaCl] and [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS]. There were no significant correlations between the fingertip temperature increases and the effect sizes in the coordinates of both the ASG and M/PSG found as significant in the group analysis of the two comparisons; [Capsaicin\u2013AS] (  p   > 0.05) and [Capsaicin\u2013NaCl] (  p   > 0.05). In contrast, the bilateral ASG in the coordinate found as significant by the comparison [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS] showed a significant positive correlation between fingertip temperatures and its BOLD signals (  Figures   ), while the M/PSG did not show any significant correlation regardless of the side (  Figures   ). Significant correlations were also found in the bilateral VPM of thalamus, left ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) of thalamus, right medial dorsal nucleus (MD) of thalamus (Data not shown) and in the hypothalamus regardless of the comparisons (  Figure   ) while no significant correlation was found in the right S1 (  Figure   ). \n\n\n### Coordination Between ASG and M/PSG and Between Diencephalon and ASG or M/PSG. \n  \nWe then performed correlation analysis between the effect sizes in the coordinates of the two cortical regions as found significant in the group analysis of the comparison [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS], given the integration and coordination between the two cortical regions. There was a significant positive correlation between the effect sizes of BOLD signals of the right ASG and the right M/PSG (  Figure   ), while there was no significant correlation between left ASG and the left M/PSG (  Figure   ). Furthermore, no significant correlations were also found between the ASG and M/PSG in the coordinates found as significant in the group analysis of the comparison [Capsaicin\u2013AS] or [Capsaicin\u2013NaCl], (see Discussion). These results suggest the neural coordination between the right M/PSG and ASG potentially in response to capsaicin application as well as the presence of non-linear neural integration among different sensory modalities that occurs during the respective tastants application (see Discussion). \n  \n The integration and coordination between two brain regions. (A,B)   Correlation between the effect sizes at the peak coordinates in the left ASG and left M/PSG   (A)   and those in the right ASG and right M/PSG   (B)   obtained in the group analysis of the comparison [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS].   (C)   Correlation between the effect sizes at the peak coordinates in the left VPM and left M/PSG   (a)   and those in the left VPM and left ASG   (b)   obtained in the group analysis of the capsaicin responses.   (D)   Correlation between the effect sizes at the peak coordinates in the right VPM and right M/PSG   (a)   and those in the right VPM and right ASG   (b)   obtained in the group analysis of the capsaicin responses.   (E)   Correlation between the effect sizes at the peak coordinates in the left ASG and hypothalamus   (a)   and those in the left M/PSG and hypothalamus   (b)   obtained in the group analysis of the capsaicin responses.   (F)   Correlation between the effect sizes at the peak coordinates in the right ASG and hypothalamus   (a)   and those in the right M/PSG and hypothalamus   (b)   obtained in the group analysis of the capsaicin responses. \n  \nHowever, to reveal the neural interaction between the subcortical brain region and the cortical region, we performed the correlation analysis between the effect sizes in the coordinates found as significant in the group analysis of the capsaicin responses because there would be no neural integration in the subcortical brain regions. The left and right VPM were significantly correlated with the effect sizes of the left and right M/PSG, respectively (  Figures   , respectively), as the solitary tract carrying the primary taste information projects to the M/PSG through the VPM. The left VPM was not significantly correlated with the left ASG (  Figure   ) while the right VPM was significantly correlated with the right ASG (  Figure   ). These results strongly suggest the neural coordination between the right ASG and M/PSG. Furthermore, there were significant positive correlations between the effect size in the hypothalamus and those in the bilateral ASG (  Figures   ) and the right M/PSG (  Figure   ), but not the left M/PSG (  Figure   ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe aim of this study was to investigate whether capsaicin activates the gustatory insular cortex as well as the autonomic insular cortex. We performed the group analyses of the three types of the comparison; [Capsaicin\u2013AS], [Capsaicin\u2013NaCl], and [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS]. Regardless of a difference in these types of comparisons, the significant increases in BOLD signals were observed in the bilateral ASG and M/PSG (  Figures  \u2013   and   Tables   \u2013   ), and also the effect sizes in the left and right ASG obtained in the group analyses of three types of the comparisons were significantly higher than those in the left and right M/PSG (  Figures   ). The fingertip temperature measured after capsaicin application was significantly higher compared to the control whereas no significant temperature changes were observed following application of NaCl or AS (  Figure   ). The bilateral ASG in the coordinate found as significant by the comparison [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS] showed a significant positive correlation between its effect sizes and fingertip temperatures (  Figures   ). These results suggest that capsaicin activated the ASG more selectively and potentially compared to the M/PSG, which may be responsible for autonomic responses reflected in fingertip temperature increases. \n\n### Can the Tasteless AS be the Control for Tastants in fMRI Responses? \n  \nBecause AS is tasteless solution, the response to AS has been considered as a control that simply causes tactile sensation in the gustatory insular cortex ( ), and subsequently in many studies ( ;  ;  ;  ), fMRI response to AS was subtracted from those to other taste stimulations. However, in terms of the intensity of the response and the spatial pattern of the excitation in the gustatory insular cortex, it is questionable whether the AS response can be treated as a control. First, it is well known that many different pyramidal neurons, each of which respond to a different stimulus modality, such as tactile, pressure, cold and warm temperatures, pain, and tastes, are intermingled in the gustatory area and there also exist such neurons that respond to multimodal stimulations ( ;  ;  ;  ). All these neurons may be synaptically connected, and non-linear summation of synaptic inputs would take place in respective pyramidal neurons in the gustatory insular cortex in response to any taste stimulation. Thus, a taste recognition occurs in the gustatory insular cortex as a result of non-linear integration of many neuronal activities induced by stimulation of various sensory modalities with a tastant. Then, the subtraction of the AS response from some taste response may not necessarily reveal the pure taste response. Second, fMRI studies demonstrated that respective tastes were represented as specific patterns with considerable overlaps in the gustatory cortex ( ;  ). This suggests that taste recognition is mediated by the activity of a different subset of cell assembly representing differential spatial pattern of excitation, similar to that observed in rats ( ) although it was also reported that each taste quality was represented as a discrete hot spot in the gustatory cortex in mice ( ;  ). Water also causes a spatial pattern of excitation, which was not the same as the overlapping area of any two of four basic tastants ( ). If this is also the case in human subjects, these observations suggest that subtraction of water-like AS response from the response to some tastant may not necessarily reflect the pure taste response and is not the right way of evaluation of taste response. Therefore, provided that AS is a tastant that causes a sensation of tasteless, the group analysis of the comparison [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS] can be an estimate of the area that shows selective or significantly more potential responses to capsaicin application compared to NaCl or AS. The fMRI responses in the left hand area of precentral gyrus (M1) induced by button presses which were performed as soon as the subjects detected the arrival of tastants on the tongue before perceiving tastes did not vary depending on the taste difference among the three tastants, as revealed by the abolishment of the M1 activation by computing the contrast of interest [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS]. Then, even if the button press affects the fMRI taste responses, the button press would cause the same effect on the taste fMRI responses regardless of the different tastants. Therefore, the computing of the contrast of interest [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS] would isolate the taste responses in the taste-associated brain regions to capsaicin application by canceling the possible overlapping activity. Indeed, there were no significant correlations between the temperature changes and the effect sizes in the coordinate found as significant by the comparison [Capsaicin\u2013AS] or [Capsaicin\u2013NaCl] whereas there was a significant correlation between the temperature changes and the effect size in the coordinate found as significant by the comparison [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS]. \n\n\n### Reliability of Fingertip Temperature Measurements During MR Scanning \n  \nIn this study, capsaicin increased the fingertip temperature significantly. The radio frequency (RF) transmitted from the electromagnetic coil may cause a slight increase in the core body temperature inside the MRI bore. However, the left hand little finger is outside the bore, and the temperature loss will occur during blood flow through the forearm into the peripheral endartery in the little finger. Therefore, it is unlikely that MR scanning causes significant changes in the fingertip temperature of the subjects without application of tastants that activate autonomic nervous system. This is also supported by the observation that the temperature changes observed following application of NaCl or AS were statistically insignificant and much smaller than that observed following application of capsaicin (  Figure   ). We calculated the fingertip average temperature for 15 s before and after an entire capsaicin session as a control and an effect of capsaicin application, respectively. In this case, the interval between the two measurements was 35 min (the duration of one capsaicin session, during which a paired capsaicin block repeated three times with 10 min interval), which would be long enough for the development of autonomic responses. Even if the fingertip temperature were increased by RF, 10 min interval is good enough for the recovery of skin temperature to the original value ( ), in contrast to the cumulative effects of capsaicin. \n\n\n### Differential Activation Between the ASG and the M/PSG in Response to Capsaicin Application \n  \nThe M/PSG responds not only to pure taste stimuli as the primary gustatory area but also to stimulation of other intra-oral sensations as an integrated oral sensory region that plays a crucial role in feeding behavior ( ). It has been demonstrated by an fMRI study in human subjects that tasting and swallowing of capsaicin caused excitation in the M/PSG ( ), suggesting that activation of oral TRPV1 receptors by capsaicin caused the hot and spicy sensation in the primary gustatory area of M/PSG. Partly consistent with this previous study, we found that the oral administration of capsaicin activated the bilateral M/PSG while the bilateral ASG were also activated by capsaicin (  Figures   ,   ,   and    ). However, as revealed by the computing of the contrast of interest [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS], the   T  -value and   Z  -score were higher in the ASG than in the M/PSG (  Table   ). Consistent with this observation, the ROI analysis also revealed that in response to capsaicin administration, the effect sizes in the ASG were significantly larger than those in the M/PSG (  Figures   ). These observations suggest that capsaicin may have more significantly and strongly activated the ASG compared to the M/PSG. \n\nRegardless of the ASG or the M/PSG, the effect sizes were significantly larger in response to capsaicin application compared to NaCl or AS application. Furthermore, in spite of the taste difference between salty NaCl and tasteless AS, there were no differences in the effect sizes between the ASG and M/PSG in response to AS or NaCl and no differences in the effect sizes between the responses to NaCl and AS in the ASG or in the M/PSG. Consistent with this observation, there were no significant brain areas with the comparison [NaCl\u2013AS] (data not shown). However, it should be noted that tastants were delivered to the posterior part of the tongue which expresses TRPV1 receptors more densely compared to the anterior part and is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve ( ) while salty taste of NaCl is mostly sensed in the anterior part which is solely innervated by the chorda tympani nerve ( ). Therefore, the comparison of effects sizes between capsaicin and NaCl or AS or between NaCl and AS does not necessarily reflect the modality difference in the insular cortices. Nevertheless, it can be at least concluded that capsaicin activated the ASG more selectively and potentially compared to the M/PSG. \n\n\n### Autonomic Insular Cortex Activated by Capsaicin Application \n  \nThe insular cortex is composed of functionally diverse subregions, which are involved in gustatory and olfactory processing, somatosensation, interoception, motivation, and the maintenance of homeostasis ( ;  ,  ;  ). The involvement of the insular cortex in autonomic functions has been studied extensively ( ;  ;  ). Anterior insula and left posterior insula are potentially involved in human autonomic functions ( ;  ). Recently, the autonomic functional organization of the insular cortex has been revealed to be gyri-specific by the three autonomic manipulations: Valsalva maneuver, hand grip challenge, and cold pressor challenge ( ). In particular, the ASG was found to be involved in sympathetic regulation as assessed by electrodermal activity and high-frequency heart rate variability ( ). \n\nTransient increases in heart rate and blood pressure, and tympanic temperature were observed immediately after ingesting, chewing, and spitting out hot red pepper ( ). In the present study, the ASG was more strongly activated by capsaicin compared to the M/PSG (  Figures   ). The fingertip temperature measured after capsaicin application was significantly higher compared to the control (  Figure   ). The bilateral ASG showed a significant positive correlation between fingertip temperatures and BOLD signals (  Figures   ). These results suggest that the ASG plays a crucial role in inducing autonomic responses following capsaicin administration, as reflected in fingertip temperature increases. Furthermore, the significant positive correlations between the effect size in the hypothalamus and those in the bilateral ASG (  Figures   ) suggest that the ASG activity caused an increase in the fingertip temperature through the activation of the hypothalamus. Indeed, the peak coordinate found as significant in the hypothalamus by the group analysis of the capsaicin responses corresponded to the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, which is known to be involved in the control of body temperature ( ). \n\nAfter conjunction analysis between all the responses to the respective taste stimuli, insula, and postcentral gyri were prominently activated following application of tastants on subject\u2019s tongue, and the precentral gyrus was activated during pressing the button. Other regions including bilateral supplementary motor area, bilateral middle cingulate cortex, bilateral middle frontal gyrus, and bilateral cerebellum were also activated (  Table   ). These regions were also reported to be activated by the nociceptive responses to heat, capsaicin, or mechanical stimulation applied to the hand or forearm skin by using positron emission tomography and fMRI ( ). However, the supplementary motor area and cerebellum were known to be involved in the regulation of sympathetic activity ( ), as revealed by significant correlations between fMRI signal and instantaneous high frequency power of heart rate changes ( ). \n\n\n### Do Capsaicin-Induced fMRI Responses in the Insular Cortex Represent Pain Perception? \n  \nIn the present study, capsaicin was applied at a concentration of 65 \u03bcM, which is 10\u201330 times lower than that contained in tabasco sauce and similar to that of curry sauce. In a previous study, capsaicin was applied at 44 \u03bcM which caused neither pain sensation nor activation of the ASG ( ). \n\nRobust activations in the anterior and posterior long gyri (A/PLG) of the insular cortex during nociceptive stimulation were consistently shown in fMRI studies ( ;  ). These posterior parts of the insular cortex together with inner opercular cortices form a first-order nociceptive matrix, and a second-order perceptual matrix is composed of the middle and anterior insular cortices, the anterior cingulate gyrus, anterior frontal, and posterior parietal areas ( ). It was also reported that nociceptive input was first processed in the posterior insula and then conveyed to the anterior insula using Stereo-Electro-Encephalography before neurosurgery ( ). \n\nIn the present study, a group analysis of the comparison [2 \u00d7 Capsaicin\u2013NaCl\u2013AS] revealed that capsaicin activated the ASG more potentially than the M/PSG without significant activation of the A/PLG (  Figure    and   Table   ). As the A/PLG is the first-order nociceptive matrix, these observations suggest that capsaicin did not cause pain sensation but activated parasympathetic nervous system to cause an increase in the fingertip temperature. Usually, in response to cold acclimation of the fingertip, the contraction of fingertip endartery would be caused by \u03b12 adrenergic action to prevent the temperature loss ( ). However, under the resting condition with oral administration of capsaicin, such adrenergic response would not occur whereas adrenergic action on the heart induced by capsaicin would increase blood flow in the fingertip endartery to increase the fingertip temperature. \n\n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nYK and NS designed research; SK and HS performed research; AS, HT, and YY acquired fMRI data; SK, HS, MS, and HT analyzed data; SK, HS, YK, and NS wrote the paper. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tT-value\tZ-score\tPeak p (FWE-cor)\tCluster size (mm3)\tSide\tAnatomical labels\tBrodmann area\nx\ty\tz\tUnnamed: 3_level_1\tUnnamed: 4_level_1\tUnnamed: 5_level_1\tUnnamed: 6_level_1\tUnnamed: 7_level_1\tUnnamed: 8_level_1\tUnnamed: 9_level_1\n\u201332\t18\t8\t12.15\tinf\t0.0\t105472.0\tL\tAnterior Insula\t\n\u201354\t\u201322\t20\t11.0\t8.03\t0.0\t\tL\tPostcentral Gyrus\t41.0\n36\t22\t4\t10.84\t7.96\t0.0\t\tR\tAnterior Insula\t13.0\n\u20134\t\u20132\t64\t9.78\t7.46\t0.0\t36928.0\tL\tSupplementary Motor area\t6.0\n6\t12\t58\t9.69\t7.42\t0.0\t\tR\tSupplementary Motor area\t\n\u20138\t4\t40\t9.59\t7.37\t0.0\t\tL\tMiddle Cingulate Cortex\t24.0\n36\t50\t16\t8.41\t6.76\t0.0\t4352.0\tR\tMiddle Frontal Gyrus\t\n42\t36\t24\t6.22\t5.41\t0.0012\t\tR\tInferior Frontal Gyrus (p.
